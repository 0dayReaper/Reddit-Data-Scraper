There are 6 members in OnlyOneOf and they are paired together for their solos and the mvs tell a story(Idk if that makes sense) for example, Yoojung and KBs solos correspond with each other\n\nThe descriptions are pretty heartwarming aswell, on Yoojungs it says \u201cAmong the countless lovers in the world, there are also lovers who couldn\u2019t be blessed. For whatever reasons. Religious reasons, things like parents\u2019 disapproval. I dedicate this song to all those lovers that couldn\u2019t be blessed\u201d",

Y'know, 5 years ago this was still somewhat surprising. Them legs tho.\n- [The Boyz Boy](https://youtu.be/yuk0LHFSlR8) just gotta ignore the obligatory 'girl' ya know the drill xD\n- [Irene, Seulgi - Monster ](https://youtu.be/Ujb-gvqsoi0)\n- [Woosung - Face](https://youtu.be/vI6OD4VJssM)\n\nAnd then basically everything OnelyOneOf or Holland but that's a given.

The song is called On Track\n\nIt's like a high school kdrama setting and Hyunjin, Lee Know, I.N, and some girl are the main characters. Hyunjin and Lee Know are friends and the girl gets between them. My interpretation is that Lee Know likes the girl but Hyunjin likes Lee Know. And I.N likes Hyunjin. There are so many things in the video that make me think so but you can watch it for yourself and see what you think\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XkxWIAe3NDU",

Very much queer anthem!\n\n[All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4w8IbQTJpY&amp;ab_channel=SMTOWN) by SNSD, the music video features drag queens. I'm not sure if the lyrics hold any queer meaning.\n\nEdit: I can't believe I forgot about Brown Eyed Girls' [Wonder Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q3RoDYObOA&amp;ab_channel=BrownEyedGirls) !  The lyrics aren't that queer at all, but the music video is heavily queer because it was done in collaboration with Neon Milk (basically a lgbtq collective based in Seoul) and therefore the MV features many drag queens and highlights them!",

By Khan has a pretty gay video, so in my eyes, it\u2019s a pretty gay. \n\nTouch by Anda is such a gay video but can be a gay song if you view it through a gay lens. \n\nI like to listen to Sunmis Warning album through a gay lens. I like to pretend it\u2019s about coming out and Coming to terms with your sexuality. She said heroine is a prequel to gashina. Heroine she\u2019s in a toxic Herero relationship and is complacent in it. In gashina, she\u2019s realized she\u2019s gay and it hurts that he\u2019s moving on but she\u2019s A FLOWER NOW. Siren, the video is her trying to run away from her inner queer, the song is her rejecting a guy cuz she\u2019s just not into boys, sorry. Get away out of her face. \n\nBut imo the gayest is Secret Tape by Sunmi. She wrote it after finding out her and Seulgi we\u2019re gonna do a reality show together. The lyrics are so fucking gay, I swear Sunmi does this shit on purpose. \n\n\n\n\u201cYou can show me a little\nYour time\nI just need a little of it\nA bit of awkwardness is okay\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can\u2019t tell anyone else\nEven if we get a little drunk\nAnd start saying whatever\nThat\u2019ll only be our memory\nEven if we say weird things\nIt\u2019s our memory\n\nPromise not to tell\u201d",

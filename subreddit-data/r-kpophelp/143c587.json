Of course there are exceptions, but a lot of the rock in kpop leans soft rock.\n\nFor artists that generally put out more rock-based songs there\u2019s bands like onewe, day6, nflying, ftisland, cnblue, rolling quartz. For idol groups there\u2019s Pentagon, Dreamcatcher, maybe A.C.E. I\u2019m not as sure about soloists, but what I\u2019ve heard from Loren has seemed rock-ish. \n\nThese are covers, but Onewe and Pentagon covers are often rock versions. \n- Onewe Hip, Latata, GG medley, Hype Boy, Egotistic\n- Poppia was a Kcon song sang at different events by different artists. Pentagon\u2019s version was more rock than other versions\n- Pentagon Lovesick Boys, Not Shy, and Savage on It\u2019s Live\n- a lot of it\u2019s live performances are more rock purely because of live band arrangements\n- Ateez\u2019s Answer: Ode to Joy is like a rock-opera version of the original\n- Xdinary Heroes Hellevator",

My favourite is probably [On The Ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Kq4I5TuuE).\n\nI'm also a huge fan of [this performance](https://youtu.be/bU2BDRLazaE?t=410) of Super Junior's Don't Don, where Max Changmin and Trax brought the song to the next level. Max's high notes are mesmerising.\n\nAs for straight up rock songs by Kpop singers, we have Chen's [Up Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_5M_9Jd5Y4) and [Watch Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOHqjOcW51w), Max teaming up with the legendary Ha Hyun-woo for [Hybrid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCODvb5wGLc), and Suho covering Songolmae's [Love All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdUjrzxSt-A).",

They're also a rock band so you can look at most of their discography, but they also do a lot of covers and give them more of a rock sound if it's not already a rock song. The examples I can think of off the top of my head are their covers of (G)I-dle's Tomboy and Stray Kids' Hellavator.",

Maybe also an explanation for why/what parts of the song that make it standout? Thanks\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nFor reference I use the Monarch MK2 for in ears and Focal Clear for over ear.",

They designate the quality of their tracks and they have a decent kpop selection. \n\nFrom an audiophile standpoint (we are huge audiophiles - I have custom UE RRs and the moondrop blessing2 for out and about listening fed through an ifi DAC. The home hifi system is PSB speakers with a Cambridge Audio setup that feeds over Wi-Fi to our receiver to keep any loss to a minimum), I really love:\n\n- the rose Heal - voice is so unique and they mastered it warm, even in digital \n- not Kpop, but continua by nosaj thing is my number one most played album of the year and it features hyukoh. I have it on vinyl and it\u2019s impeccable.\n- Heyday By 3racha (stray kids) isn\u2019t lossless anywhere that I\u2019m aware of but it\u2019s a song with a lot of layers and we love cranking it up and trying to pick out the layers. It\u2019s just a song with a lot of sonic depth. \n- again, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s kpop but ashmute is excellent even if you can\u2019t find it lossless. Dreamy, warm mastering, excellent mixing. I especially love it on the in-ears when out and about. \n- mid-air thief (on vinyl - can\u2019t find it lossless digitally) is also such a nice thing to listen to. Punchy, but balanced.",

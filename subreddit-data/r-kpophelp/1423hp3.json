They will have so many shows in the US but never actually cover a good amount of cities in Europe and i'm just so confused on why. \n\nI am from austria and i would die to see sone groups live. We have big venues, we have the audience so why doesn't it happen? \n\nAre there any theories or an actual explanation?",

Copying over what I posted in a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/12pz3wg/why_do_some_girl_groups_never_embark_on_a_tour/) here)\n\nFor concert tours, Korean agencies work with concert promoters that handle things such as the schedule, venues, and travel logistics. When submitting a plan, they have to prove that each concert stop will make satisfactory amount of profit.\n\nIn the past, it was expected for US cities with high Asian populations to usually be selected since they would be a safe bet. Those three cities you mentioned would probably be the \"safe bet\" for Europe, knowing they can sell out all concert days and be worth the trip.",

            "comment": "In addition to what people already answered, I think these cities are big transporation hubs and benefit from (relatively) easy access from all over Europe (+ have direct flights to and from Korea). \nFor example even if you don't want to flight you can still take a direct train (no connexions required) to Paris from London, Brussels, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Geneva, Milan, etc... Korean entertainment companies probably expect European fans to travel from one country to another for concerts, like American would travel from one state to another. It is indeed similar in terms of distances/travel time, but maybe they tend to forget the language barrier (or potential currencies changes since not all countries use the \u20ac) that make it slightly more complicated for fans to travel within Europe compared to the US.",

You would have LA, NYC, and maybe Chicago in the US and London, Paris, and Berlin in Europe.  Then when they can demonstrate a demand, they branch into more cities.\n\nLike for ATEEZ, they did Madrid, London, Paris, Berlin, and Amsterdam in 2022 and then added Brussels and Copenhagen when they came back in 2023.  Since they could sell out tickets in bigger arenas, they branched out to more locations in the next tour.",

I'm gonna move away soon but it would still make me happy to see a kpop group come to more than just those same three cities because there are actually tons of fans in other countries and cities.

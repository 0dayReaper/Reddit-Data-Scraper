    "postText": "Hello! Sorry if this has already been asked - I looked through to search and I couldn't find anything. \n\nI've been a fan of Kamimoto Kotone ever since GP999, and I was so excited when she was announced as part of TripleS. I've been thinking about collecting some of her photocards, but I'm honestly just confused on what the photocard situation for the group is in general. \n\nI see in templates people list \"objekts.\" What exactly are objekts? Are they the NFTs? Additionally, sorry if this sounds rude, but what exactly is the point of a digital photocard (I understand it seems to have some involvement in voting for future TripleS related things but do they have any other function?) How would it be different from just having a PNG exactly?\n\nAnd do objekts have physical forms? Are there even any physical cards for a member like Kotone who has not properly debuted in a unit with an album?",

People refer to their physical photocards and digital ones as objekts.\n\nPhysical photocards have a QR code on the back that you can scan in. This gives you a digital photocard (which is also considered an NFT). You're right the main purpose of them is for voting for tripleS, but some people also like to collect them / trade them like regular photocards.\n\nNFTs are different than PNGs because they're exclusive to a limited set of users, while PNGs can be downloaded by anyone. That's why you can see some NFTs be very valuable if they're one of a small set. It's the same idea as photocards vs just printing photos of idols.\n\nAlso there are Kotone photocards since she was in the Assemble album.",

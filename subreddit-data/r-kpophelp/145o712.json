    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a beginner dancer, I\u2019ve looked for vids like \u201ceasy kpop dances to do\u201d but I feel like it\u2019s too much for my brain to start with, learning 3 minute choreographies to me takes 3x more time to memorize.. I want to start with chorus parts or Kpop dance challenges groups post since they take a much shorter duration to learn, and I will know more dances. If you are similar to me, will this be a helpful start to improve?",

            "comment": "Depends on the song. Some choruses are really simple and some are the hardest part of the choreo. Tbh usually you won\u2019t learn too much from choreo meant for verses since they\u2019re usually toned down compared to the chorus and require multiple people to do properly. \n\nAnyways, you aren\u2019t required to learn the whole choreo if you don\u2019t want to so don\u2019t force yourself, if you don\u2019t want to do the whole song I recommend learning the pre-chorus to chorus, maybe dance break if you want a harder challenge :)\n\nAlso to answer the other question, I\u2019ve definitely improved with just doing choruses/dance breaks !",

            "comment": "Yes. Always take choreos in sections, and start with the chorus first \u2014 after all, what's the point in learning if you can't dance to the part you (probably) want to dance to the most? \n\nTake any choreo you want to do and split it into roughly 30 second pieces. Screen-record these from a dance practice or a recording of an individual member like Weekly Idol usually(?) has, *or* use the demo of a choreography if possible; idols are good dancers, but you can't beat the choreographer. Using this method you can scrub back and forth through each clip as you like, rather than constantly skipping back 10 seconds while doing it on Youtube. \n\nDon't focus on details, just get the basics so the general shapes and flow is right. Learn that, listen to the song a lot, and wait to the next day to do more; in my experience the body takes a bit to catch up to the mind. Once you get the basics of the choreo down and have practiced it, go back in and add the details later. As you learn more, come back to older choreographies periodically and adjust or add to them.\n\nAlso, before you start at all, I reccomend looking into popping and hiphop basics; you don't necessarily need to learn them on their own first, but if you can find some videos on them and just get a sense of what you need to be doing and what you don't it may help you. How deep you get depends on how you wanna dance, some people like the precision of popping and others like the groove of hiphop.",

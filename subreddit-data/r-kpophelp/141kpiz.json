    "postText": "i was never really a ballad person until i saw a group from cube called a train to autumn . im telling you i fell in love with their ballads and love them to my hardest score . so please check them out but anyway , i found them on kprofiles and they were labeled \" ballad group \" . there was only one other group with a label like that and i think they only had one song and were kinda unprofessional \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d so im asking if anyone knows other kpop groups with only ballads , because i think those groups dont make their ballads like fillers and are really good . also i lost my grandma last year and ballads help me cope , so if you know any please let me know !!!!!!",

I think Yuju has good ballads too?\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, Til We Meet Again by Aespa is so good. Also Not Beautiful by Pink Fantasy\n\nYou'll also find ballads a lot in OSTs, though those are much harder to easily find and I'd imagine a lot of them are rather basic.",

The earlier seasons (pre-Covid) focused on artists forming bands to do oversea busking performances. The 4th season (which I really love) focused on bringing music to frontline workers and other general audiences who were in need of live performances as relief in Korea. Currently they\u2019re doing Begin Again open mic which I take to be smaller scale performances? \n\nMy personal favorite performer from this series is Kim Feel. Lee Sora and Lena Park are also obv standouts. A lot of the participants ppl here are more familiar with: Crush, Henry, Lee Hi, Lee Suhyun, Taeyeon\u2026 It\u2019s honestly a very healing show and nice vibes.",

[Your Temperature](https://youtu.be/R8gS3L97OIs) is my personal favorite. Even their debut (with some questionable fashion lol) was [already so great](https://youtu.be/HtcwQrdkqak).\n\n\nAlso recommend Jooyoung... he doesn't always do ballads but in general the ones he's got are just unbeatable. [Daydream](https://youtu.be/eF2jC0sv1-o), [Lost](https://youtu.be/IsU2fYMObZo), [From Me To You](https://youtu.be/UHAliFJanT4), [Can You Hear Me](https://youtu.be/JyAr87dF_2M) are all songs I recommend as your, like, starter pack to Jooyoung.",

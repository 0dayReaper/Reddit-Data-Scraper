            "comment": "considering she has no photocards, i assume she owns no seventeen albums? if so, the best present would probably be buying an album for her! it\u2019s the easiest to purchase. i\u2019m not sure where you live but you can buy seventeen albums in stores like target (though target currently only has their latest release, fml), and other online stores like music plaza, choicemusicla, etc. amazon has them too but be careful from who you buy from. you could maybe ask her what her favorite song/album is, and then buy the album based on that.\n\ntheir last few albums have also had these versions called \u201ccarat versions\u201d - basically there are 13 different versions, 1 for each member, so you could maybe see if you could get her a mingyu one! for that you\u2019ll have to look online and see if a store has specified that they\u2019re selling a mingyu version, because the versions are random (meaning if you went into a physical store, there would be no way to tell which member you\u2019re getting based on the physical packaging). \n\nfor your questions though - knock off merch usually isn\u2019t a good idea, especially fake lightsticks and photocards. kpop stans usually find them very valuable and its not the same if those two items are not official. things like jewelry and such should be okay if its unofficial, but in general official merch is more more valued than knock off merch.",

            "comment": "Knock off lightstick is a BIG no-no, photocards are a serious business for many fans and for them fake pcs are also a BIG no-no so better not risk it, if you don't know what to look for you will NOT get the real thing. As for the other merch it depends on the person, some fans don't mind it, some do, but at 14 it might be very important for her to have the Official\u2122\ufe0f thing so if I were you I'd try to find something Official \u2122\ufe0f for her.\n\nHow about simply getting her an album? Kpop albums aren't like your usual CDs, they're more like collector items and are full of goodies (photocards included!) so that would be a great gift even if your sister doesn't have the CD player lol.",

            "comment": "I would also say either an album, some official merch (maybe your parents can pitch in some money) or fan-made stuff like jewellery, there's a lot of really cool shops on etsy etc with beautiful hand made stuff! And fan made things are really loved and accepted in the community, not like cheap knock-offs that try to look like official merch but are horrible quality \ud83d\ude1b you are such a cool brother! My boyfriend got me a lightstick for Christmas and I was so incredibly happy! She will love you forever for this \u2764\ufe0f",

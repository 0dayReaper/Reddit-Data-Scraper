    "postText": "So I like K-pop as a 29 year old married man with a kid. Especially Twice. And people like friends or family members find it weird.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a Dutch man, got my own business and I\u2019m quite conservative is I say so. In short, the last person you expect to listing to Twice.\n\nI always pick up my little niece (13) from her hockey practice and she loves K-pop. So I always allowed her to listen to her music. After a couple months of listening to her music I started to like it, Fancy from Twice was my favourite. And now, 6 months further I\u2019m a fan, maybe not as big as real fans but I enjoy their songs (old and new ones). Also newer groups like New Jeans or older soloist like IU I like to listen to.\n\nMy wife was at first surprised but thinks the happier songs fit to me. My friends think I\u2019m weird and when I show them the videoclips or insta reels they look at me like a disappointed parents.\n\nI\u2019m not shy or embarrassed by it but it\u2019s fun to see the reactions of people around me. Nonetheless I enjoy picking up my niece every week for a good car music session :)\n\nDo you know anyone that\u2019s listens to K-pop but you don\u2019t expect it from them?",

The music and the visuals are great. The videos remind of when MTV actually played music. And the message of most songs are fun, positive and empowering.

Just look at the way people treat girls who collect photo cards and kpop merchandise vs boys who collect baseball cards and sports memorabilia. It\u2019s seen as silly and shallow and immature when girls are into something. Does kpop rely heavily on parasocial relationships and the boyfriend/girlfriend image in its marketing? Sure. Does that mean everyone who listens to it is into it for that reason, and that the music itself is only enjoyable for teenagers? Absolutely not. \n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older and matured more and been through a bunch of shit, the less I\u2019ve cared about what others might think of me. I\u2019m going to be 42 in a couple of months and I\u2019ve long since outgrown judging people for their taste in music, or caring if others judge me. The world is often a stressful and scary place.

I think that's why people find it weird, because they have an preconception that all kpop is is songs designed to appeal to 11-14 year olds. \n\nI posted Antifragile in my workplace's Teams last week (I'm more or less open about liking kpop at my workplace), and a colleague commented \"Is this kpop?

Dismissing an entire genre of music based on stereotypes is ridiculous. What actually drew me into K Pop was the fact that it's beautiful blend of all my favorite genres R&amp;B, Hip hop and Pop. \n\nPlus my ult groups MONSTA X and MAMAMOO create truly original music. And I saw MX last year and wow they are true performers. Like I've seen icons like Janet Jackson, Beyonce, Jay Z, George Clinton live and Monsta X was absolutely on their level. I truly believe K Pop is music of the future. \n\nSince I'm a Black millennial woman I still do get some judgement when I bring up K Pop but I don't care about that ish. Good music is good music.",

At first I thought it was odd to see older people liking them but now as I'm older and work with adults I've encountered so many adults who like kpop as well. Including most of my sister's friends who are in their early 30's.

Her ex auntie once told me a bunch of cool things about herself when my bestie was out of town and only the two of us were hanging out. She told me that she is 32 at the moment and is in love with BTS , black pink, twice and she is like the bigggggest exo fan and she always wears stuff like oversized hoodies and sweats to most occasions and she mostly always has a pair of airpods in her ears and she has dated over 20 guys in her late twenties including my bestie's uncle who she got married to at the age of 30 when the  uncle was only 25 and all of these things and more about her have always made people give second thoughts about her and she also said that when she was twelve her mother even took her to a veryyy pro psychiatrist only because she never liked the concept of religion and told her parents she didn't want to follow any particular religion once she is an adult and all of it made me look up to her so much and i know that people must also judge her for hanging out with my bestie as they do not have any certain relationship anymore but i lovee how she lives every second of her life so moral of the story is that if you have a mindset of loving yourself , you could be a 13 year old girl with a moustache and in hoodie with a mess of a hair and still slay your story.....\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\ude01\ud83e\uddc1\ud83d\ude18",

I\u2019m glad I heard K-pop a few years ago. I loved rap music and electronic dance music, when I was younger but rap lyrics changed over the years so I stopped listening to it. I felt like it wasn\u2019t upbeat, fun exciting, sexy, romantic anymore. Now I can listen to that kind with K-pop, and I am so glad it\u2019s back in my life. When I go to concerts I\u2019ve had concert goers a lot younger than me, tell me how much fun they\u2019re having because I am there. They love to see me there and we have fun dancing together! We just went to the Stay Kids LA concert D2 and had so much fun! I have a really loud whistle to cheer too. My 34 year old daughter and her friends go with me. She loves loves loves BTS and Stray Kids. I got her into K-Pop. LOL Actually she is super glad I did and of course if I\u2019m writing something here I have to put a shout out to my faves right?

People thought it was weird because I wasn't into boybands before that, and they found it weird that they're all asian. Or specifically like the Dutch say \"Chinese\". -_-\n\nAnyways I'm 22 now and went to my ever first kpop concert with my sister. She just wanted to see Berlin, but came to the concert with me to record it all. On the other side of me sat a women of 45 years old that came on her own, she told me she always loved music and went to many kpop concerts around the world. She got into kpop because of one of her kids, that are in uni now, so they couldn't come with her.\n\nSo you're not on your own to be a bit older and enjoying kpop for yourself. I saw many people like her around us too. Just parents of kids with their own lightsticks, if they even came with a child of theirs.\n\nThe week before the concert my dad asked me to put on some music of the concert we were gonna go to so my sister \"could get used to it\". We went through some albums and there was one song they recognised, 'Chewinggum', since I had put it on before for my niece when she was 4, and she loved it. But after going through some songs now she found a new favourite, 'Fire Alarm', and that one had to be played on loop while she kept running around spinning chairs and what not. She had an interest in the guys too and asked for some videos to watch on the tv. Welp, every second they have a new hair color, so I had to keep telling her that the guy with pink hair was someone else now. All in all, her conclusion was that she wanted to come to the concert too, but we were not going to bring a 6 year old with us on this short busy city trip to Berlin.\n\nMy parents didn't mind the music much, same goes for my sister.\nEven though after the concert my sister had two songs she liked! 'Beatbox' and 'Trigger the Fever'. \nThe whole fanchants, lightsticks, and the rainbow we did for Dream were all things she was surprised at but thoroughly enjoyed watching or being a part of. Same goes with the butchered German the guys were trying to speak.\n\nMy sister is usually a fan of Latin music, and she did like REIK x SUJU's 'One More Time'. So when we went shopping in Berlin, me looking for some potential albums, she was again surprised by all the differences in albums. And I could point out some SuJu albums. \nShe followed NCT Dream afterwards on insta that she never uses and searched for some more videos of the concert we went to. And my sister is 31 years old, so not specifically young either.",

My Apple Music playlist is MOSTLY K-pop with some punk rock and jpop sprinkled in there. For the past like 4 days I\u2019ve been playing IVE shit on repeat. Hell, I even go to their concert.just this year I\u2019ve been to:\nblackpink\nPixy\nMamamoo (to come)\nTwice (to come)\n\nI like the girl group music more in general but I have all. Kind of K-pop in my playlist. People have had the same reaction as your friends but it is what it is. I\u2019ll still drive with the windows down blasting TT",

I\u2019m also rather conservative, male, masculine, Saudi Arabian, not a city person and I usually don\u2019t like to get into celebrity culture but feel special just sounds too good.\n\nI\u2019m not a big stan but people still make fun of me and I go along with it, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never made fun of them for something. Happy you don\u2019t feel anything bad. May we meet again at a twice concert Insha\u2019Allah.",

But you know what's great most of them don't care about older fans and some of their parents are into K-pop as well.Also, I've been specifically been getting my friend to listen to Kpop and he's 26m (and it's working he's a Stay now) but I know he likes Twice too less than 24 hours ago we were singing along to the feels.\n\nThe thing is, age and gender doesn't really matter, you like what you like and as long as it doesn't hurt anyone do what makes you happy. Life is too short to care about others. I recommend finding some other fans and make a little group of friends you can share your interest with. You've got a great start right here.",

I just started liking some of K-pop this year, thanks to TWICE. * Momo is my bias. \u2764\ufe0f  Sure, I admit the girl groups are attractive (fact) , but OMG... the videos are fascinating!! The choreography is unbelievable!! And as someone who recalls the \"Milli Vanilli debacle\" of the late 1980s, it's a relief to learn how multi-skilled every single performer is!  I am eagerly learning as much as possible about all things K-pop (videos, Korean terms &amp; lyrics translations, group biographies, etc.  I had no idea how deep the culture is.",

Plus Twice is a group full of adults so i don't know why you'd bring that up under this post. Many adult women stan newly debuted boy groups with minors in them and fawn about them on twitter without backlash, but it seems when the roles are reversed its perceived as worse.",

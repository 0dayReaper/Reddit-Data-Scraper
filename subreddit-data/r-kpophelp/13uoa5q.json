Off the top of my head I can think of a lot of EXO ones like Call Me ~~Daddy~~ Baby and Monster, NCT 127\u2019s Sticker and Ay-Yo (funnily enough both from Calixte), and f(x)\u2019s 4 Walls which actually kind of bangs\n\nBut yeah, if you want to look anywhere, look at SM artists\u2019 catalogue for English demos",

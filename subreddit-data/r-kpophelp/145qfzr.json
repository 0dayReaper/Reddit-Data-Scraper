An 808 is a drum machine that synthesizes drum sounds and in drill music, the synthetic bass is made to pitch slide across notes to produce that kind of sound. Crescendo is a song that incorporates UK drill elements so that\u2019s why the sound was included. Maybe it\u2019s a sound you\u2019ve heard if you\u2019ve listened to other drill.",

    "postText": "Shazam failed me at a restaurant so I\u2019m hoping some of you guys can help me find this MV/song. \n\nVideo was a just an orange haired girl dancing by herself in a room that was mostly blue lights with occasional strobe lights. There were bass drops where the girl would be dancing on a bed. Vibes of the song were more EDM-y and had a more aggressive/edgy tone. The singers voice was a bit lower in pitch. I think the song ended with English lyrics and it was a line about drum beats?\n\nSorry for the lack of details but that\u2019s mostly what I remember, thanks in advance for any replies~~",

Or [Candy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zuoSn3ObMz4&amp;pp=ygUJQ2FuZHkgbmN0) by NCT Dream. Or [Love Shake](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iLXyoC2HRgY&amp;pp=ygUPTG92ZSBzaGFrZSBtaW54) by Minx.\n\nBit different but perhaps [Sea of Moonlight](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HiIjdaSlFug&amp;pp=ygURc2VhIG9mIG1vb25saWdodCA%3D) by IU &amp; Fiestar too. Or even more different but [I Swear](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8PrNPhVexE4&amp;pp=ygUNU2lzdGFyIHN1bW1lcg%3D%3D) by Sistar,  [Darling](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QB4dQcxgJPY&amp;pp=ygUSZGFybGluZyBnaXJsJ3MgZGF5) by Girl's Day and [My Darling](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_SmmXMCTsxM&amp;pp=ygUMRGFybGluZyBha211) by AKMU also have the beachy feel, as does [She's Back](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=weIiaA-h4pk&amp;pp=ygUTc2hlJ3MgYmFjayBpbmZpbml0ZQ%3D%3D) by Infinite and [Hello](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lNvBbh5jDcA&amp;pp=ygUJSGVsbG8gam95) by Joy, and [Aing/Listen to My Word](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_W4dL2Av6LE&amp;pp=ygUQc2luZyBvaCBteSBnaXJsIA%3D%3D) by Oh My Girl. Even bigger stretch but I also think [Good Day](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jeqdYqsrsA0&amp;pp=ygULR29vZCBkYXkgaXU%3D) by IU and [I'll Be There](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CipF26oiY54&amp;pp=ygUWSWxsIGJlIHRoZXJlIGJveWZyaWVuZA%3D%3D) by Boyfriend share some similarity but without the summeryness but these may be too far from what you're after.\n\n(Also quite a few of these I've listed are actually covers hence the retro sound, so there are their originals out there too)",

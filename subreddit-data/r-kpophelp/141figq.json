    "postText": "Hi, since there are so many different artists performing at weverse con, I was wondering if\n1. Is it offensive if I bring a lightstick of a group that isnt performing but is under the hybe label? Because.. tbh idw to spend more money on a lightstick for a one off festival..\n2. Will the v3 of the army bomb or even the carat bong connect to bluetooth like the other lightsticks so that at least the colour is uniform??\nOr does anyone know if they tend to give out their own type of lightsticks for weverse con since there artists outside the label this time??",

You also don't have to bring a lightstick!\n\n2. If the Bluetooth has worked for recent concerts it should be okay, I think? I'm not too well versed on what recent hybe concerts have been like for various versions as my hybe ults are either disbanded or txt with only one version LMAO",

I was thinking if there were too many issues then I would just leave the lightstick behind but also going to a concert without a lightstick feels very empty for me personally! I'm kind of hoping there's some news that there is a common lightstick for all artists there since some artists like boynextdoor dont even have a lightstick",

Rolling Quartz, a five member rock girl group/ band under Rolling Star Entertainment are releasing their first single, titled Blaze!\n\nit\u2019s great to finally see a girl group venturing outside of the norm and embracing a genre in kpop that has been mainly male dominated up until now. i encourage you all to check them out and support the girls! \n\nthese girls went big on kpop twitter for their live rock cover of [Dynamite](https://youtu.be/fvgCA1QrtQg) by BTS and gained quite a bit of attention, and currently have 20k followers on twitter! \n\nhere is a link to their [youtube](https://youtube.com/c/ROLLINGQUARTZofficial) which currently has 36.2k subscribers \n\nhere is a link to their official [debut mv](https://youtu.be/Pg51wRHMRek)\n&amp; i\u2019m wishing them a v successful release!\n\nedit: was to add link to the dynamite cover!",

Are you specifically just looking for k-bands that straddle the idol line? Because if not, I can recommend you a few more if you'd like. I've got some indie female rock bands (or female-led) that I adore and would love to share.",

Both of them have two totally opposite vibes.\n\n* Fishingirls are an upbeat pop-punk-ish band: [Fishing King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4YiFF1SfNI), [Enamoure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SIbYdAOZqM), [\uc751 \ub2c8\uc5bc\uad74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQIYoUwXiWw)\n* Seoulmoon are a soft-rock/dream-pop-ish band: [We'll Stay Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVWvfO6TMdw), [Coconut Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6PMkmsJ9X4), [\ucc98\uc74c \ubd24\uc744 \ub54c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrNj0TimxLM)\n* There's also Se So Neon which has female lead vocals and is pretty popular: [The Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJfGfB4-vP0), [cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2f30sx2b3V0), [A Long Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzL4A8hyXc8)\n\nThese two verge pretty far away from rock but definitely have elements in their music that were inspired by the genre:\n\n* Ashmute are this dreamy electronica group with the most haunting melodies and female vocals: [Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QawTHEb9SE0), [Scenery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8TqqFoSjb0), [Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu5dwtCj2tY)\n* cacophony is... life-changing if I were to be totally honest. And I'm barely exaggerating. She's a solo artist. Her music isn't for everyone. It's really experimental and goes in so many different directions, it's hard to explain it. Try these songs and if you feel like you enjoy them, I'd highly recommend checking out both her albums. From Harmony: [Breath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAwCSnV83-s), [In the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynFi8_wLwfw). From Dream: [Return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyHuVLSNAC8), [Tu me dis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pRbrOqYV1w)",

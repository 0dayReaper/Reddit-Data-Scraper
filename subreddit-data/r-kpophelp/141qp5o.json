    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am an event organizer from Toronto, Canada hoping to organize a Toronto Kpop Dance Festival on Friday August 11 evening.\n\nI've reached out to a couple kpop dance groups in toronto ( utkd, fouryou, havoc, wak crew etc..) And so far we have 5 groups interested. I'm hoping to find more dance groups on here who would be interested in performing. \n\nIf anyone knows any kpop groups in toronto who would be interested in performing, or would be interested in putting together their own group for this dance fest, please DM me or leave a comment :D The venue will be at an auditorium Markham with a beautiful stage that has an LED background and cool lighting effects.\n\nThanks so much for reading :)",

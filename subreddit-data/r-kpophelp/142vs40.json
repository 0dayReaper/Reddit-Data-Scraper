    "postText": "So i had the idea to show a save one drop one video to a friend who doesnt listen to kpop, because i thought it would be very interresting to see what he would pick. Since he doesnt know any kpop songs, i was looking for a video that has a lot of iconic songs, and plays them for a little longer, so he can get an idea of the songs. So far this video is the best i found for that purpose: purpose: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qAbj_3a-_7w.       but i think the segments are a little too short. Recommendations are much appreciated.  (Edit: fixed the link)",

That one\u2019s interesting because you have to pay a pretty expensive tuition to attend and so there\u2019s no trainee debt and you can leave whenever. \n\nStill find it weird that BBC had everything planned out for a solo debut even before they knew which girl they would choose for it (given they debuted her after just one day). A lot of the Loona members also spoke about the spontaneity of their debut. That company is kinda wild lol.",

Then he and BBC had a falling out and he just up and left, took a lot of stuff with him too. This guy had also been involved with Ladies Code at some point before Loona, too. There are a few videos on the matter, but I think the one remember specifically is what Mera did on Youtube. I'd really love for some of the Loona solos and units to come back though.",

Then, they added the twin because they wanted a vocalist and Dongmyeong is the childhood friend/neighbor of one of the founding members CyA. Xion acted as their manager, and when the group one a contest, they got to play as the sessions band for a singing competition. \n\nYonghoon won that competition, so the members (who were teens at the time) invited Yonghoon (who was already an adult) for coffee and asked him to join their band and he agreed. They also made him the leader.\n\nOn ONEUS' side of things, Ravn basically harassed the CEO and director of RBW along with staff to accept Leedo at RBW. They both trained at and left YG asnd remained friends. Eventually, the CEO was so tired of Ravn talking about Leedo, he agreed to let Leedo audition even though his strong image was the opposite of what they wanted for the group. \n\nHe auditioned and made it into the group, so they went from being trainees together at YG where Leedo said he was betrayed to being members in the same group at RBW.",

He still has the scar.\n- Heechul from SuJu is known as \"Kim Condom\" among women in the entertainment industry because of how safe he is to be around.\n- Yura from Girls' Day has her legs insured for nearly half a million dollars.\n- Almost all of Stray Kids have gone through dangerous yet ridiculous experiences. Han barely avoided being eaten by a crocodile in Malaysia, Hyunjin and I.N. almost accidentally joined a cult, Felix was nearly hit by a car, and a helicopter crashed into Seungmin's apartment building in 2013.\n- G.O. from MBLAQ dropped out of high school because of SNSD's Taeyeon. After being defeated by her in a singing contest, he had such a mental shock that he left school to focus on his music career. They're still friends to this day.\n\nI'm sure there are lots of weird fun facts out there but these are the craziest ones I can think of off the top of my head.",

Wooyoung and Yeosang were/are best friends and made a pact at BH that if they succeeded, it would be together, and if they failed, it would be together. So Wooyoung, (who was probably gonna be in the TXT lineup from the little he's talked about his time at BH,) left BH and followed Yeosang to KQ, where he was the last one to join Ateez.\n\n(Yeosang and Wooyoung are still very clearly close to the TXT members, especially Yeonjun and Taehyun, which makes sense because they all probably trained together. Soobin also mentions Ateez a lot, too, when he's not really one for mentioning his friends outside of the group/company.)\n\nHongjoong has also talked about how he was a part of reviewing auditions and looking over profiles/tapes and has mentioned that Yeosang had heavy interest from 5 other companies and how he was like, *he need him here with us*.",

Despite being on hiatus (due to military enlistment) they\u2019re still pretty relevant in Korea.  They have multiple popular members (Zico, P.O.), and while they were active they always charted well in Korea.\n\nAteez is an example of the opposite.  Most of their fandom is international.  Before Kingdom they were considered \u201cnugu\u201d in Korea.",

I knew that Chuu was famous for the Chuu heart, but I was thinking that Heejin was more famous in Korean ads for her visuals (since we all know that Korea loves perfect visuals)",

She  is famous for the Chuu Heart, yes, but not everyone knows she created it. It's actually one of the things she talks about in varieties and everyone who didn't know gets kinda blown away, and it's super fun. Seniors started to fall for her a lot, not only in variety but idols like Sunmi, so she's building a nice network lol you can tell she got big since she even got an youtube channel gig with Chuu Can Do It, that gets really nice views. Her brand reputation rankings are also super good! Korea loves visuals but they also love cute people, and Chuu doesn't seem human at all since i don't know how a human can exist being that wholesome and so naturally too.",

Due to the fact that they only deal with the domestic market, their management/staff can be downright *racist* (no more than you see with a lot of native Koreans) towards foreigners. \n\nAs a result, their groups are permanently capped at b-tier because the domestic market can only sustain so many groups and there's just not enough people or money floating around. This is why groups that are less popular in Korea and from smaller companies like Dreamcatcher or Loona sell far more albums while gaining more momentum in Korea because they have the international money flowing in to sustain their growth.\n\nIU is a megastar in pretty much all of Asia, specifically the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and Japan. She gained a lot of popularity due to her roles in various dramas which helped her gain a lot of attention from those outside of Korea who then started to listen to her music and became fans. In Korea she is the undisputed biggest musical act. You can't go a *single* day in Korea without seeing or hearing IU in some form of advertisement; she's *that* popular.\n\nAKMU is another group that is massively popular in Korea but largely unknown outside of Korea, though they have been gaining popularity with international fans. Yerin Baek, Heize, Paul Kim, and Park Hyo Shin are also examples of this.\n\nPSY is another major example of this, though he's fairly popular all over Asia. Most people outside of Asia only know him for Gangnam Style, but he's probably the second biggest musical act in Korea behind IU.\n\nAll of these examples above of soloists are well known names in the domestic market because their music is the type of music that the general public listens to, who are largely ignorant of idol groups nowadays. The general public's interest in idol groups peaked around the 2nd gen with groups like EXO and SNSD, but have since largely declined. Nowadays idol groups are seen as the domain of young girls and women, usually between the ages of 15-30. Attend literally any 3rd/4th gen idol group concert and its about 60-80% young girls and women. For male idol groups, there's virtually no korean men; just about the only men you see are foreigners. \n\nAmong guy groups, a few examples would be Stray Kids and Ateez who are not very popular in Korea at all, especially Ateez. However they have very strong international fanbases that keep the money flowing in to sustain their operations and further growth.",

            "comment": "Mamamoo! even tho as a group they're fairly popular internationally, it's nothing compared to their popularity in South Korea. For context, they're the second girl group in history with the most streams on Melon, only after Twice. This is due to the popularity of their songs/their skills (they're considered a VERY skilled group by the public, so much they appeal to all ages of the general public who admire their talent and origins) and they are part of the artists who started to change what an \"idol\" means, because they blur the line between idols and regular artists according to the public. They work by themselves and have lots of releases, and due to the members themselves. All of MMM members have popular solo careers in Korea. \n   Wheein, who is usually considered to be the least popular internationally, was actually the first Mamamoo member to get a music show win, way before Hwasa, and she is considered a digimon since her releases chart very well, all kill and everything. She is one of the most seeked out singers for collabs (peakboy, superjunior heechul, jungkey and more). Hwasa is everywhere is South Korea, charts, variety, ads, her songs are always hits (Twit, Maria, Don't, Don't touch me). Solar has a massive youtube channel with 3millions+ subscribers, she recently got confirmed as a vocal judge in 2 big upcoming reality shows (along with iconic korean singers, she is often the only girl group/idol member included) and Moonbyul hosts one of the most popular Naver Now shows, Studio Moon Night, and she gets to interview all the popular or upcoming artists (WJSN, Davichi, Yugyeom, Mc Jae Jae, Woogi, Heize, Dreamcatcher, Fromis9, Stayc, Loona, Oneus etc etc).\n They're so hardworking not only as a group, but in individual activities as well. That means they put out a lot of content, and are always working for that, meaning their popularity and career is ALWAYS growing in a very organic way since debut. Still, you can't compare this big recognition they have in Korea to their international one, even tho it's not exactly a small one, due to the poor quality of their marketing and team, their potential internationally is not explored.",

Because Mamamoo helped build the company, all the staff works with them for years. I have the impression that they got comfortable and don't push innovative marketing ideas much. Since the girls handle everything since their debut, it's like they got used to that. If they themselves don't work the idea or push to make ir happen, then it won't. Unlike RBW's newer groups, who had a start with the help of more people besides the members themselves, since the company grew so much. Mamamoo did this during their debut because they couldn't afford a team, but now the situation is different. They're one of the biggest girl groups in SK, a 7 year old group with good things settled, solo and group wise. Their team is supposed to push foward and make sure things are taken care of, the bare minimum, like english subtitles for their channel, but it seems like even if these people are hardworking... they could simply do much better. According to recent fan signs and stuff, it seems the girls aren't exactly aware of these, hopefully in the future things get explored. Their potential, skills and performance style, is so fitting for an international public. If they break standards in Korea, here it's just the cup of tea of many who would admire their work.",

The end of this [interview](https://mamamoo-trans.tumblr.com/post/155909520558/trans-article-mamamoo-even-though-were-not), for example, is from 2017, and they say they acomplished a lot, like their first concert, but that their next goal was to do an overseas tour. The members always mention wanting to do tours abroad. Mamamoo really is a group that lives for the stage, so is no wonder they want to expand globally like this for performances.",

They have no idea they actually have good fanbase outside of korea, because of the lack of promotions. Often when they talk to fans about it they joke saying they think no one would come.

One big thing that is against Mamamoo's probable success overseas outside of Asia is their lack of regular communication with fans. The so called \"Blackpink strategy\" won't work for Mamamoo because Moo Moos aren't starved for content so their sheer power of appearance is much less. BTS uses Twitter and WeVerse to keep in direct touch with fans and most 4th gen groups also use a combination of SNS to connect directly with fans. I see this as being the new normal going forward. 3rd gen groups tend not to do this and so far it hasn't made too much of a difference but soon they will find that their fandoms aren't growing or even keeping what they have. Because Western fans are farther away they tend to rely more on WeVerse, VLive, and other SNS for connection with idols and the demand for idols on these platforms is only going to grow.\n\nI can see Mamamoo continuing as they are and growing in Asian markets though. They already have big fanbases in China, Malaysia, and Philippines and their Japanese fanbase is growing(it was awesome to see their discography start trending when the Japanese version of Travel was released!). The Shopee Indonesia performances have a lot of views and I could see them doing another one at some point. Mamamoo wants to tour and them just doing a tour of Asia seems both reasonable and safer for the next few years.",

If you go to Korea and go to karaoke with Koreans, you will be very popular if you can sing along to Seo Taiji, H.O.T, G.O.D, Shinhwa, SHINee, Super Junior etc. They won\u2019t have any interest in groups like Seventeen, Stray Kids, Astro etc. Korea is like every other country in that most people like the classics and younger people like the new gens but still know the first and older gens.\n\nLike in the UK, yeah if you sing a One Direction or Billie Eilish song you\u2019ll get a few people singing. But if you sing Take That, Westlife or Aerosmith, you\u2019ll have the whole place singing.",

I think the largest portion of their fans are from south korea and japan and they have some songs that are pretty well known. I would've called Nct barely known a few years ago but they've grown a very large Korean fanbase the past year or two",

Quite underrated internationally but massive domestic.\n\nI can say they do quite well during their first few years before Nonstop as they have a lot of their songs has reach 100K likes on Melon but 2020 is their breakout year and 2021 solidifed them as top tier group. Their physical grow massively and Dun Dun Dance is number 1 hit and still in Melon Top 10 for about 10 weeks.\n\nIndividually, they are thriving too. All of them have sides project and they are kinda known among Koreans too. Oh My Girl along with Brave Girls and Blackpink is the top tier group at Korea now especially digitals.",

Korea has this prejudice which don't let them like anything rater than cute, sexy or girl crush when it comes to ggroups. they already said that their problem is with the genre of Dreamcatcher's songs, which are very rock based with distorted electric guitars and pretty strong beats, that if they changed their concept they certainly would get their first win. how crazy is that?\n\nof course Dreamcatcher gives 0 sh*ts about it and already said they won't change their concept to fit in Korea's taste. \n\nit's sad that a group with a discography like theirs, who is active since 2017, with girls with very distinct personalities and so much talent (one of the most synchronized girlgroups of all time when it comes to their choreography), have such little recognition in their own country. such a shame. :(",

            "comment": "i thought so too!! The only thing that came to my mind for that part was that it sounds like something bebe rexha would sing \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlso I read that some stays say it may sound similar because of the lyrics for that part. They say that the boys were inspired by the lullaby Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, so I went digging and i found an instrumental for the song and for this part and seungmins part, it didn\u2019t sound as \u2018nostalgic\u2019 as it does with the lyrics. But that\u2019s just my opinion. \n\nMaybe you can try listening to and instrumental version of the song. The one I found on YouTube was made by those fan channels so technically it\u2019s not professional but I\u2019m not sure.",

    "postText": "Not a native english speaker so I hope this post is understandable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, so I was on twitter and I came across [this](https://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/12/big-hit-trainee-leo-under-fire-for-misogynistic-song-lyrics) article which took me by surprise because while I know who Trainee A are (I'm a HYBE stan) I don't really keep up with them, i'm simply a casual fan who knows who they are and is waiting for their debut *(Especially JayJay's debut)* but when I tell you I saw this and literally gasped, I mean it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, Leo wrote a song for a showdown in which he talks about having \\*\\*\\* with a girl (? i suppose he was talking about a girl) until she basically d words, calling her derogatory names in the process and while i'm quick to brush off silly, overblown controversies regarding Kpop idols/trainees, this one doesn't seem like a *silly* controversy to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupporting secretly misogynistic idols has been a big fear of mine since I started liking K-pop *(especially, since i'm a woman myself)* and I really don't want to sound like i'm exaggerating or anything but Leo on [his vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=472&amp;v=Xl7Fife9vDM&amp;feature=emb_logo) *(he starts talking about the problematic song after minute 9)* said he really liked rappers like Lil Baby and Future, people who are known for being misogynistic and I also want to add that Leo is fluent in english so i don't think we have the excuse of \"he probably doesn't understand\" because most likely he does but then again, he literally said:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- \"Please don't mind the lyrics too much, I was angry\" and that \"We shouldn't focus on the lyrics too much, but on the overall vibe instead\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel really torn about this because I don't want to support a group that has a misogynistic dude as it's center *(because it seems like Leo will probably be like how Yeonjun is for TXT)* but a small part of me wants to believe he wrote that out of being immature and probably trying to copy western rappers and I'm hoping he gets educated about the amount of violence women face every single day, this is a form of that violence as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo yes, I'm torn and i don't know how to feel, please do not be rude in the comments I'm REALLY not trying to excuse any of his actions, I would never do that for an idol, but i just wanted to see what you guys thought while I make up my mind about this whole situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update: The original video has been put on private so whoever is behind Trainee A and the group themselves know about the controversy it caused, I'm now wondering if Leo is going to apologize.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2nd Update:** [Leo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHzXa58WYAACuOl?format=jpg&amp;name=large) **and** [the production team](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHzXcFFX0AgKcjr?format=jpg&amp;name=large) **behind trainee A have both apologized.**",

All adults had 19 at some point and I doubt we're going to say \"yeah I was the same when I was 15\" and if someone think like that, it's a big redflag like this guy. Of course adults can do \"dumb\" stuff and say \"dumb\" stuff (I don't think this is just dumb, just for any adult male), it doesn't mean the information wasn't there, because the gender issue is a big problem in Korea and the world.",

That\u2019s probably why it\u2019s so alarming, that even now when he\u2019s probably close to debut, he still seems to have this immature mindset. HYBE could make him backtrack and say something more diplomatic with a pre-written script, but there will always be doubt if he\u2019s really apologizing and realized his mistakes, or if he was coached to by the company as part of damage control. The cat is already out of the bag, so to speak.\n\nPersonally I eyeroll at these types of people who are too stubborn to apologize because they feel like they did nothing wrong. I wouldn\u2019t bother hanging around these kinds of people because they just end up raising your blood pressure. \n\nFor idols to be like this, if he doesn\u2019t suck up to the camera and show he \u201cchanged\u201d or is willing to say sorry for his mistakes, he\u2019s going to cause controversy for the future group he debuts in. If he\u2019s unwilling to show he can sit down &amp; be humble on his own merit, it\u2019s understandable to not want to look up to this kind of kpop idol.",

Seen from this twitter thread (https://twitter.com/yeonjunscypher/status/1475860144432975880?s=21) the other members are also participating in singing. This song additionally mentions controversial subjects that is mentioned by OP in the Twitter thread.\n\nThis issue shouldn\u2019t be ignored, it\u2019s quite a serious situation. I\u2019m really uncomfortable by this man-child, I sincerely hope they don\u2019t debut. \n(I am an adult female Australian by the way; beyond disgusted I\u2019m the same nationality as him.)",

When your brain is still developing you do a lot of things that as you get older you will wonder why you ever did them. While he is Australian and can understand English and that he should know those lyrics are wrong he can most likely also see artists he looks up to rapping the same stuff and not getting called out for it.  And if no one told him what he was doing was wrong and let it happen why would he think he was wrong, I mean the video was up for two months.\n\nIf it was me at that age I'd be like yeah I did something wrong and I'm sorry but also no one mentioned it when I released it so it can't be that big of an issue because I hear artists do stuff like this all the time and not get called out so why me two months later.\n\nThere is a reason why 19 year-olds are still called teenagers. They are still at an incredibly impressionable stage in life where their environment shapes their actions and do not always have enough experience to know that stuff they are surrounded by could be/is wrong.\n\nThat being said I think the lyrics are wrong and a more thorough apology should be made with more of an explanation behind the lyrics he chose and how he realizes they were wrong but we will probably not get that because SK is a very misogynistic society.",

Find other groups to stan, there are so many more talented and respectful idols out there waiting for their debut.\n\nHave a good day/night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy comment may trigger some ppl but I'm not spreading hate. I'm just not stanning him nor his group. Yes I see his apology but it's up to me to choose to accept it or not, and I don't. So yeah the end, if you support him, then goodbye, if you don't, then good for you :)",

It\u2019s also to a backing track of another song like Leo\u2019s. Is it kinda cringey at times? Is it good? Eh. But he didn\u2019t rap about killing(?) bitches and also he was rapping, not just screaming. If those are Hybe\u2019s standards I have absolutely no interest in seeing their new group, and negative interest in their rappers.",

Jaes recent controversy was from a place of ignorance while this trainee seems to have no regrets whatsoever. Plus his words cant be misinterpreted if he literally made lyrics like that. Both forms of misogyny are terrible in the end but u really cant justify this guy if even he doesnt realize what is wrong.",

I don\u2019t mean this in a bad way, but I\u2019ve seen people support western artists who do gruesome things like r*pe, child abuse, murdering, etc, yet they still have heaps of fans and their own shows, and when a Korean idol does something \u2018small\u2019 they get jumped down. Not saying what he did was small!! But like op mentioned, apparently, those western rappers have lyrics that are disrespectful against women, yet those guys earn millions and have thousands of fans. What is so different about Koreans? I never see a thread complaining about Drake\u2019s lyrics or Kanye\u2019s lyrics.",

He said he was angry when writing the lyrics which is terrifying because imagine what he would do when he isn\u2019t angry. He needs to be held accountable. The other members were cheerimg during the song (english speaking members) its your choice , do whater you wish , but dont brng your standards down. We have to hold male\nIdols accountable.",

But when i learned about this guy from the comments of their plans to debut i was immediately disgusted. And i learned that he can speak english well so he really knows what he\u2019s writing. \n\nAnd before anyone tries to say that im being too much with \u201cdisgusted.\u201d Im not gonna go to details but ive been through a very traumatising past with a man when i was young. so i really cant look pass these type of behaviour and thinking.\n\nAfter learning about this i wished /bighit will changed their decisions about him debuting, cause people will look up to these guys including him and some of his fans are gonna be teens. And that thought is just disturbing for me.",

Is that some sort of tradition 3racha established, is there any story behind it?\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\udda4",

            "comment": "like someone said before: mixtape #1 through #5 were songs originally by 3racha that were redone as tracks for the whole group. they were also released under their actual 3racha song names in skz2021 as ot8 versions (so all without woojin).\n\nbut the other ones - gone days, on track, oh, and time out - are a little vague. in [the step out 2019 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f3uy8EgJUM) they planned a \"mixtape project\" to begin in 2019 - obviously, gone days barely cleared that bar and i suspect given the whole internal drama, it was likely delayed and/or partially shelved. we know from the [step out 2020 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPf0lB55BTE) that gone days is part of the mixtape project. so it seems like the new \"mixtape\" songs are a collection of singles with no real common thread other than they aren't released as part of an album when they come out. it was likely an actual project but we might never know if that is true or not.",

            "comment": "Other than Mixtape 1 - 5, which were bonus tracks on their original albums, it seems to just be a tradition when they want to release a single in between comebacks they call it Mixtape. \nAlso in terms of SKZ lore, there appears to be a different storyline linking On Track and OH -- but it's also connected to B Me and Ex, which aren't Mixtape tracks, and Time Out doesn't seem to connect to it, so do with that what you will. \nI don't think Channie's ever addressed it but maybe you could ask him in a Chan's Room stream if you catch one sometime, I'm actually curious myself now.",

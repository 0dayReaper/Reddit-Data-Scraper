    "postText": "I really love Kpop. I am an EXO-L.  Been that for three or four years now. Because of EXO, I was introduced to SuperM and its members (went to the concert alone before the world burned and had the time of my LIFE).  Now I love all the members and their groups. \n\nIn my new multi Stan position, I have found that a lot of the fans are.... different.  They attack people from their OWN fandom for everything. \n\nMany complain about lack of promotion but forget that merchandising is part of promotion. They get mad that their faves don't have lines in songs or that their faves aren't popular. They get mad if their fellow fandom members don't vote a million times and the like. \n\nI am confused. Music is supposed to make you happy, not stress you the entire F out. \n\nI am 41 with a 15 year old daughter that has NO interest in Kpop. So I talk to the people on Twitter, YouTube, and maybe Instagram. \n\nI think because I am older and from the U.S., things like this don't bother me. Many fans lack patience (I'm an EXO-L, we LIVE on patience). Many are mad about NCT Hollywood.  When I try to explain how it will be good from an exposure and marketing standpoint,  they get mad. LOL Had someone on an NCT Dream video call me weird for calling Jisung my baby. EXO are all my babies. I am old enough to be some of their idol's mom. \n\nCan I attribute their actions to age or culture here? It baffles me that the fans make something so beautiful so hard and just ugh. I literally feel as though I will just listen to what I like and leave them alone. I love Kpop and the groups are so humble. Sometimes I just want to talk to other fans of it because there aren't many my age or my race that love Kpop. \n\n[Kpop Fandoms]\n(https://ptkendraj.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/how-kpop-changed-my-life-part-two-fan-wars/)",

            "comment": "I think being older means there is a stronger sense of self (not always, but usually). Younger people are still discovering themselves and kpop provides a great space to help people find their identity. \n\nUnfortunately, it can take a destructive turn when the self and the kpop band become symbiotic. The fan comes to rely on the group and fandom for all aspects of their emotional livelihood. And so it can become easy for the especially younger (but sometimes older) fans to engage in kpop in unhealthy ways. \n\nTbh, this is the marketing goal of kpop. Kpop would not survive without these extremely engaged fans and ultimately kpop is a commercial enterprise. As long as people are desperate to connect (which is becoming an increasing problem due to the [loneliness epidemic ](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-08-25/how-to-end-america-s-loneliness-epidemic)), kpop will be indulged in an unhealthy manner out of both corporate design and consumer desire.",

So yes at 49 I can name all members of many groups. \n\nMusic is universal and shouldn\u2019t have an age limit. I listen to many genres of music and Kpop is just one of the ones I really enjoy!

A cosmos, but micro, nonetheless. As for me, it feels weird not knowing so many of the new groups, but I got into Kpop around the Bigbang/Beast/Got7 era, so it's to be expected, actually back in the day those were all young groups and you had the whole Cassiopeia/SUJU reminescence, it was a different time, but that is just life, some people were actually around the Seo Taiji era, so for them the Cassiopeia/TVXQ are all younglings. ;)",

To keep you sane, you'd have to find people who share the same mindset/sentiments as you. I wouldn't be able to point you to the right direction where to find these people because I don't belong to the fandom but there will surely be someone out there.\n\nI'm assuming you're not calling the artist your \"baby\" to his face but rather just a term of endearment in a comment or something. Mommy fans are common. I personally don't think this is weird. There are a lot of fans who become fans because their maternal instinct is triggered and they see the idols as their kids.\n\nTLDR; you're fine but if the issues bother you, being a casual fan is not a bad idea",

Not all older fans are like this, and not all younger fans are like that. I've met some awesome people through penpalling who are more mature and our outlet to chat about Kpop is with each other while we have other things going on in our life.\n\nFor reference, I'm 28, and even I don't think I'm too old for this.

YouTube just isn't good for discussion because there's no attempt to build a community and something about Twitter brings out the worst in people. I've had way more luck with Tumblr (which is pretty calm these days) and Facebook (which tends to attract older audiences and which you can find local communities for.) Honestly I'm pretty confident that your experience will massively and immediately improve if you switch platforms. \n\nI do think age can play a role, but it's more because the age dynamics get really complicated. I avoid a lot of platforms because I just got so tired of watching adults (knowingly or unknowingly) getting in knock down fights with twelve year olds -- it's so inappropriate and so unpleasant. I also think your priorities change as you get older. For example, older fans tens to have more money and less time, so we focus more on buying merch/albums than streaming etc, which can lead to a lot of unnecessary conflict.\n\nI'd question what you're saying about race, though, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just phrased that weirdly but if you're going on with that mindset it's pretty inevitable that you'll run into conflict.",

I definitely agree with what you're saying -- it's always good to be aware of cultural differences, especially when the fandom is so international. In fact, it can help avoid a lot of conflict. I've seen so many fights both on and offline that were really just cultural differences not translating properly.

I find YouTube to be GENERALLY positive, but you literally always have a few idiots out of the bunch that go down the wrong side of the scale. I stopped using Twitter a long time ago because Twitter stans are batshit half the time and FB groups tend to have younger and/or slightly more obsessive fans in them from my experience.\n\n\n\nReddit has always served me well, even when I've left and come back.

I have since childhood.  I just want everyone to just get along. I mean, I know they won't but at least have a little bit of respect for one another. \n\nAnd yeah, arguing with kids is not the life I want. I have this weird problem with trying to get people to be objective.  This is why I had to look at myself to see if I was part of the issue. I will be taking these recommendations. Thank you again so much! I didn't even think anyone was going to respond.",

With increase in numbers of fans, this means more visibility for kpop \\~things\\~ on general social media\n\nI'm an older kpop(not in age but in timeline of being into kpop) fan myself, TVXQ/JYJ were my biases. Arguments were rife in 2010, fans attacking each other, fans actively organizing to sabotaging certain groups and their fanbases.  Being upset at promotions, being upset about release schedules from companies etc... It's all common for kpop and it's one of the shittier things about the industry. Celebrities are sold and marketed in a way that makes fans think and feel like they have 'ownership' of them.\n\nBut yeah, arguments were always popping off on AKP forums, soompi forums, omona and one hallyu. You need to ignore about a good 90% of kpop fans, find the poeple you get along with and call it a day. You'll drive yourself into a tizzy trying to find order in the chaos that is kpop stans.\n\nEdit: I'm a good 10\\~ years younger than the dongbang boys but they're still my babies too!",

A lot of people said the same thing. I saw them live and it was great and I don't do crowds or people but it was the best. \n\nAnd then all their groups got Stanned and got my money. LOL",

I saw a video yesterday of a cover she did in her pre-debut days and she has an really good voice that is rarely showcased in ITZY. Had she been put in a different group like RV or TWICE, she would be regarded as one of the best main vocals in kpop rn. \n\nI do agree that her dancing has gotten WAY better recently, she was really good in In the morning and I'm happy that she's getting way more lines.\n\nALSO same, I've tried to learn a fair amount of BLACKPINK choreos and dancing is hard, I admire idols like Lia or Jisoo who give it their all despite not being the best.",

I can say that I do wish I could give all the fans that really take this to the next level some insight or even a hug. It makes zero sense to me spending time hating other people for who they like or not being a \u201cday one Stan\u201d. I think that we have the benefit of having a preferred style bc of our experience but also the respect that comes along with age that I don\u2019t feel many kids now have. I do tend to get along much better with Ikon fans because they are much more laid back and I dig the vibe that goes with them. I think in general the amount of time idols are available to fans is wild. I\u2019m also in the US and I still have a hard time understanding having that much accessibility to someone. Not to mention I just feel weird being that I could be their older sisters and not someone who sees them as love interest lmao. \nI try to just remind people that they represent their idol in this little universe and showing love and compassion to someone could change their whole day, month, year, life. But again it\u2019s hard because they are growing up very attached to these artists and sometimes it feels like a breeding ground for toxic behavior and you want to protect everyone and explain \u201cit\u2019s not that serious\u201d and \u201cyou and your music tastes will change but the negative things you put out into the world can\u2019t be taken back\u201d.  But again I think it all comes with age but I do find myself wanting to protect idols as I can\u2019t understand how they do it.\n\nI wish there was a big sister/brother type program for being there for younger kpop listeners. Sometimes you just need someone to talk to, and as someone who lost their family, I get the strong feelings people feel for others and things they love.  It would be fun to hear what they like and provide them with a positive outlook, a kpop mentorship if you will lol.",

We hear all the time from us singers and celebrities that having fans is such a burden so I think it\u2019s switching off that mindset and reprogramming it to realize that your support isn\u2019t burdensome when it\u2019s reciprocated and appreciated. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s making a lot of sense lol. I do love watching the funny things that other people make of them as I really do just love to laugh and enjoy the music. It really is nice to get to watch these fun interactions since so many of us have not enjoyed a living room full of friends and jokes in a long time so they will all always hold an exceptionally special place in my heart because of what they gave during this stressful and lonely time. I think I\u2019m just a sentimental one lmao. I just love when groups clown each other and not take themselves seriously it\u2019s like having a friend over lol.",

            "comment": "Thank you for sharing your experience and perspective. I'm from the US and found kpop after being disillusioned by the US music industry. I found Taemin, then SHINee, and later SuperM. I'm here for the music and have only been \"attacked\" (for asking a question) by non-Shawols. As a Shawol, I'm happy and support the members and their music and activities as much as I can.  My only sadness is that after a major post-military service reunion and comeback (Don't Call Me album and Atlantis repackage), our maknae, Taemin, is leaving for his military hiatus on May 31st.  In the meantime, we have his new album, Advice, on May 18th, plus their debut anniversary on May 25th, Japanese release on May 23rd, and many VLives and Beyond Lives. The Shawols and Taemints I interact with daily are a blessing in my lockdown life. I stay away from the meanies and trolls and concentrate on the new content from the group, as well as the solo music and activities of Onew, Minho, Key, and Taemin. I also support creative content providers, reactors, artists, and translators. (Always open to finding new artists, writers, and creators.) Having fun and relaxing with SHINee and other kpop artists is helping me navigate the pandemic. (I'm off to finish a paper due today as a grad student.)  Good luck finding the most enjoyable and effortless way to experience kpop!",

That\u2019s why people are mad, because it\u2019s f*cked up that LSM would rather create a whole new group to appease the west and make NCT seem \u201cwestern friendly\u201d rather then pouring in that money to actually promote them in the west. Why westernize kpop when the market is already dominated by western artists and when you have artists that are already so popular in the west. You don\u2019t see BTS America or GOT7 Hollywood. But they\u2019re both huge in the west. \n\nNCT Hollywood is just a racist idea to fit with settler colonialism and make white wash the Asian music industry. \n\nAlso the baby thing is definitely weird. Had a grown woman (41) who was a stranger that I never met called me \u201cmy baby\u201d I would 100% be creeped out. It probably didn\u2019t bother them because they hear it so much but it probably didn\u2019t make them happy either. (Although people could argue this, I\u2019m just going to say, in my opinion as someone whose the same age as Jisung, had I been on a video call with a 41 year old man (reverse roles) and he kept saying \u201cmy baby\u201d I would 100% be uncomfortable yk? \n\nAlso NCT is one of the most laid back fandoms there are (considering others) and most of the things you stated as argument within their \u201cown fandom\u201d is actually just criticism towards the companies and way the artists are treated. \n\nI can\u2019t lie here a lot of what you say isnt about being an older kpop fan, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t realize how these things are issues and not \u201cjust young people\u201d (which i think is kinda ageist tbh) \n\nIf you maybe try to spend more time on Twitter and insta and see the POVs of the fandom you\u2019ll realize they\u2019re mostly correct. \n\nI hope this helped!! :)\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m gonna rephrase this: \u201cI can\u2019t lie here a lot of what you say isnt about being an older kpop fan, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t realize how these things are issues and not \u201cjust young people\u201d (which i think is kinda ageist tbh)\u201d \n\nTo:\nA lot of what you\u2019re saying isnt about being an older fan but just how you view the issues differently as an individual as there are probably young people who have the same POV as you and older fans who have the same POV as others!! The ideology that one specific age group believes one thing in kpop is what I think is ageist (personally, not anything you said or to you directly \ud83d\ude2d) \n\n\nSorry about the confusion!!",

I'm guessing I'm somewhere in between you and the OP in age (I'm late 20s) so maybe I can provide another perspective.\n\n&gt;The ideology that one specific age group believes one thing in kpop is what I think is ageist\n\nSo, I agree with you that there are definitely younger fans who feel more like the OP and older fans who are more into the type of fandom culture that she's describing. That said, I think that there IS a generation gap that can be related to age simply because fandom culture has changed so much over the past 5-10 years, so older fans can be used to things that younger fans consider cringe at best and offensive at worst.\n\nTo address the \"my baby\" thing, for example \u2013 when I first got into kpop \\~10 years ago, I sometimes called my bias \"my son\" because that kind of talk was EVERYWHERE at the time and I got used to it. Nobody was talking about \"infantilization\" or anything back then. I actually think that the complaints about infantilization started as backlash toward just how common that kind of talk was. It's become a lot more taboo over the past 5 years or so. So a currently 15-year-old NCTzen probably entered the fandom being told that \"baby\" talk was weird, but a 41-year-old NCTzen who has a longer history in fandom and likes calling idols her babies might feel put-off by people suddenly telling her that it's wrong. I'm not saying that being accustomed to something gives people license to do whatever they want, just explaining how I think that age itself really can be a factor.\n\n(I fully agree though that fans absolutely should not be saying stuff like \"my baby\" directly to the idols, that has way too many uncomfortable implications and pushes boundaries IMO)",

I think you just don't have the same view as others do. I do think that age has a role in this because younger fans tend to get more stressed about their artists than older fans do.\n2. Complaining about lack of promotion and lack of lines (especially when the member has been in the group for 5 years, but if you erased all of their lines from songs it wouldn't be noticeable because they never get lines \\*cough\\* Winwin \\*cough\\*)  is perfectly reasonable, because the more support from their company a group/member gets, the better for their career because they get more exposure towards fans, and fans are the driving force being k-pop groups and companies. I have no idea why certain fans forget about merchandising though. The more support from people that a group has then the more they're able to go on shows and have comebacks.\n3. Fans that get mad that their faves aren't popular are just frustrated and to an extent, it is understandable because it's a good feeling seeing the talent that you appreciate get recognition from other people too. It is when they start throwing a tantrum that you realise that not everyone in the fandom is in their right mind.\n4. Fans that get mad that their fellow fandom members don't vote a million times just don't realise that people have lives and not all of them revolve around being a K-pop fan. I recommend just ignoring these comments. You'll just waste your time trying to explain logic to an idiot.\n5. Twitter has too many toxic fans. You're better off not using the app at all.\n6. About NCT Hollywood: It's not exposure and it is not good. First, it's unfair to the NCT members themselves who've worked so hard to build the group and get it to where it is now because right now SME does not treat them right. SME can't manage the members properly now (unfair line distribution, unfair screen time, no protection from haters and sasaengs, Sungchan and Shotaro are not in a unit) imagine how they'd treat them when they add more members. Second, it is not exposure because NCT 127 is already massively popular in the U.S.A. Also, SuperM was made for the sole purpose of promoting in the West. What would be exposure is SuperM and NCT 127 not getting discarded to the side. NCT Hollywood is just an attempt to westernize K-pop which is not needed. There are millions of other Western artists out there, if people want to listen to Western music, then they can listen to those artists. K-pop is a music industry for Asians, it does not need non-Asians to come and start taking over when they already dominate the music industry. It would be fine if there was like two non-Asians in the group and the rest are Asian-Americans, but I doubt SME would do that. NCT Hollywood is just harming NCT's reputation. Lots of people already have a hard time getting into them because of how many members they have, so adding more now will just drive potential fans away. Also, what about the trainees that are waiting to debut? Most k-pop idols train for months if not years to get to be able to debut, and having a competition show like this one is an insult to all of their hard work.\n7. Calling idols your babies is infantilization and it's not cool. It doesn't matter that you're old enough to be their mom, what matters is that you aren't their mom. Whether they're 14 or 27, it is weird, because babies are not able to talk fluently or walk, but these idols clearly are able to. It's creepy seeing a random stranger calling you their baby. Imagine how you'd feel if a random 80-year-old woman called you her baby out of nowhere. Uncomfortable, right? It is important to draw a line in parasocial relationships or it can get out of hand.\n\nEdit: Sorry I misused infantilization, but it's still weird that you think of them as your babies. It really is important to realise that you don't actually know these people in real life. When all the bullying scandals came out in February, I saw tons of people saying that their idol was too cute and would never do that. You aren't their mom or sister or girlfriend (unless you are) and you should never cross the line and infringe on their privacy or make them uncomfortable. I should also clarify that for the unfair distribution in songs I meant when the member barely gets any lines in all of the songs the group has not just 1 or 2 songs in the entire discography or album. Also, unfair distribution is not mistreatment but mismanagement. Your favorite idol getting 2 lines in a song is mismanagement, but in situations like B.A.P's, it is mistreatment.",

If a rapper doesn't get much line in a song without much rap, it's kinda normal. \n\nThese kind of problem also mostly stems not out of mistreatment or some sort, but from voices compatibilities. Producers just deem some voice match certain line or sound better (esp. for vocal line). Just few moment ago, someone said that SM mistreated jaemin for giving him little line in hot sauce. Bro.... if SM mistreated someone, it wouldn't be jaemin.\n\nSure at some case, MAYBE there is a some kind of mistreatment. But, most of the time, they just want to produce a good product that sell (according to their judgement, ofc).\n\nAnd about the baby, I don't see baby = infant. It's also used as a word of endearment, especially for those younger, not necessarily a literal baby. But I get, some people could misunderstood the word.   \nP.S.

Telling people not to fight among fandoms because the groups have respect for one another and we should do the same. I also don't really get involved in popularity contests. \n\nBasically saying anything that takes people outside of their comfort zone and trying to at least look at things a different way is an issue. But I have a psych degree and part of psychology (a huge part) is looking outside of your beliefs, your upbringing,  your prejudices,  and trying to see it from all sides. This angers certain people but I feel that this needs to be done for us to learn to respect other people and their opinions. Just because it isn't your opinion doesn't make it wrong, ya know (not you, just in general)?",

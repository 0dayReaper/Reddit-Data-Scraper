    "postText": "I'd like to start purchasing broadcast pcs (specifically XG broadcast pcs), but I'm having a hard time distinguishing a real one from a fake one. I know that with album pcs there are small things that can help with finding those differences, but I haven't seen a lot of information about broadcast pcs. I've also heard someone say that there can be variability in broadcast pcs so they could look slightly different. How commonplace are fake broadcast pcs and is there a way I can be sure I'm purchasing something authentic? I feel like it's hard to even trust feedback and ratings... Any information would be extremely helpful!!",

            "comment": "it is really hard with broadcast pcs especially with \"less popular\" groups. you could maybe look for people who already have real broadcast pc and ask them if they could compare theirs to the sellers pcs or something like that and search up as many references online and compare the edges if the picture looks zoomed in etc. otherwise i wouldnt really know what else to do either \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I\u2019ve been trying to do that, but when I find one that seems zoomed in to me, I also find another reference (real pc) that\u2019s zoomed in similarly to the one I thought that was fake. I\u2019m wondering if music shows are given separate batches of pcs or if a bunch are made at one time and then handed out to the music shows.",

I\u2019ll keep doing my research, but it seems like the only way to be sure is to actually be lucky enough to be selected to attend one of the live events and be handed one directly. Their album pcs are easier to tell which is fake/real though because of the holo on the back \ud83d\ude2d",

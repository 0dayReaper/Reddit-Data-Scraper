    "postText": "What is going on here? I\u2019m looking for any kind of news around Billboard charting and only found one for the Global chart. Their last EP entered the top 10 and for this one I can\u2019t find news about it charting on the 200 OR US World which you need like, 2k units to achieve.\n\nSince their previous EP hit 50k I don\u2019t see a way they missed that chart. Is their some technical reason it would be disqualified? I know they sold it in the US as I know Target Carrie\u2019s it.",

Like they have exclusive covers, different page numbers than the regular zine versions, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird strategy though. How much of the hype will have died down by the time people can get their hands on them? Unless SM is planning for Aespa to have a marketing push near the end of the month focused on the US market.",

They're all still called Bubble, but Stray Kids are on JYP Bubble, and XEED are on STAR'S Bubble, for example, so you just need to check which app to download.\n\nYou buy within the app, but it's managed through Google Play so if you need to cancel, you stop your subscription like that. I assume it's the same on AppStore, but I don't have Apple, so I'm not sure.",

That's a per month price.\n\nI've had a look on the STAR's Bubble app, and the pricing seems similar.\n\nI only have XEED and (some of) SKZ, so I can't comment on other apps.\n\nHope that helped!",

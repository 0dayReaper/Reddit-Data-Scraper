Sio does too\n\nAnd Taeyeon!!",

Hyolyn - powerful, distinct, lovely in my ears\n\n3. Yuqi - her voice is unique in Kpop. Bright light voices are common, Yuqi is warm dark caramel sauce. Her cover of Flowers is amazing.\n\n4. D.O. - one of the few truly RnB and soulful voice in Kpop. His runs are perfections. He is my absolute favorite male vocalist\n\n5. Wendy - maybe due to the fact she grew up in Canada and became part of a choir, so the Western influences in her technique is very apparent. I love that she can be soulful in one song, powerful in another, and happy/energetic in most releases.",

Other voices who have a similar effect on me from the top of my head: Baekhyun, A.C.E Jun, Ph1harmony Keeho, NCT Renjun. \n\nEunwoo, Svt Jun, Ateez Yeosang, Nuest Minhyun and TBZ New all have voices that scratch a very particular part of my brain, they're all similar somehow in some specific way but idk how to explain it.\n\nJisoo's voice has something similar to the last ones mentioned but it also makes me think of moving water idk I love it so much. LSF Eunchae also kinda reminds me of this, her voice sounds like she's underwater. \n\nLSF Kazuha's deep voice is so cool, I love listening to her. \n\nI am particularly fond of a specific SM female vocalist sound, think Taeyeon, Winter, Ningning, Wendy. Joy sounds like a Disney princess and I'm just a little bird who wants to fly over and listen to her all day. Seulgi... I don't think an explanation is needed for Seulgi. \n\nAs for rappers, I love whatever Suga, J Hope, Ph1harmony Jongseob and Xikers Yechan have going on. Their flow and delivery sounds so chewy to me lmao idk it's the best.\n\nOH also I.M's voice is just so incredibly sexy I'm basically almost on my knees every time I hear him rap \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nETA: also TXT but especially Yeonjun and Huening Kai. I'm a huge fan of rapper Yeonjun's delivery and Huening Kai's voice is so unique, reminds me a bit of what I like about Jisoo's voice.",

            "comment": "Stray Kids Han Jisung. He is an amazingly talented rapper, but his singing voice is also out of this world. [let me bless your ears with his compilation ](https://youtu.be/CJUjXTP_mmk) because this boy can sing just about anything. He has range that is second to none. Emotionally speaking, his voice brings up this feeling that is like a calming rain, or a warm blanket. It's so pristine and beautiful. [Here's a Playlist of his solo songs ](https://youtu.be/ox8rHgY_gRk). I truly believe he's 4th gen BGs Ace. \n\nIn BTS I feel like each member has a distinct voice and colour in how they perform, but RM / Namjoons voice be it in singing or rapping has a warmth that is unmatched. His solo album [indigo](https://youtu.be/OxdgwUncvqA) is a masterpiece and portrays this warmth perfectly. Rapping, his choice has a depth and passion that is unmatched.\n\nThat being said I also have a weak spot for Yoongi / Agust D / SUGA singing recently. Seeing that man live 3 times, singing his heart out, was something else. His singing voice is one of my favorites ever, and [D Day](https://youtu.be/cWTwudvsppI) is another masterpiece of an album. [life goes on](https://youtu.be/npa8ZdEpjfo) Live was simply astounding and showed his growth as an artist. The way he can change from arrogance, to deep introspection, to pure passion and fire at the drop of a dime and show that in his voice is wild! I love how he changes not just each album, but each songs flavor and colour to match the vibe and brings such uniqueness to each song. \n\nMuch like with Han, Jhope / Hoseok primarily raps - but has an incredible singing voice and a unique colour to it. Here's [another compliation](https://youtu.be/Q5etQPZ5MOU) of Jhope singing - he truly is the ace of 3rd gen.  I hope in future BTS songs post 2025 we get to hear more of Jhope in the vocal line being prominent (he does a LOT of the backing vocals)\n\nThe BTS rapline singing just, is incredible. There's nothing those men can't do and do well. \n\nIU has my favorite female voice of all time in Kpop and otherwise. I can only describe it as comfort in its purest form. \n\nAfter seeing them live, Wheein from Mamamoo took my breath away and has such a unique quality in her singing that I can't even describe- the tone, colour, control.. she has it all! \n\nAlso, honorable mention to Jihoon/ Woozi because I love his voice so much and think he's one of the best male vocalists out there, period. His control is incredible, and he has a distinct flavor to his voice.",

You might familiar with Polaroid Love, yes, [Jake is that intro guy](https://youtu.be/JQ-2sk2ELJI). He made the song sounds so good and adding more flavour to it. Fyi, Jake took the most part and involvement in Enhypen intro and outro. He's the one who sings these parts in outro [Foreshadow](https://youtu.be/V_48aC7yC-I?t=77), intro [Fate](https://youtu.be/dIHSNME7xqk?t=90) and [Walk The Line](https://youtu.be/q5LgpmZwht8?t=96). He made us craving and demanding for full version of these intro and outro. In fact, he got the most part chosen for their [album preview](https://youtu.be/47SAocGDKrw). There are 3 out of 6 songs is his part alone: Fate, Sacrifice and Bite Me. You can hear how good the songs are because of his vocal. In conclusion, Jake's vocal is the best for me.",

The first time I saw his face and heard his voice, I remember asking my friend is this a real human being? How can a real human being can sound like this and look like this? Then I watched their variety shows and saw Jaejoong doing some freaky stunts like moving his shoulder joint or something and eating huge amounts of spicy food without so much as a wince. After that I practically confirmed my belief that he's not entirely human. Talking about this really takes me back, good times.",

When I first saw Jaejoong, I just stopped the video and just stared at him for a while. I couldn't believe his beauty. And when he started singing his pre chorus line, little me fell in love with that man. Everything about him was just... perfect. Now I grew up and I'm not listening idol music anymore I'm just looking for some memes and stuff but I listen old TVXQ songs everyday.

He competed on Boys Planet and was one of the best vocalists on the entire show.  I love how his voice can be clear but he also makes it kinda husky sometimes and idk I just love his singing so flipping much.\n* Twice's Jihyo.  Her voice is SO POWERFUL and I always look forward to her lines in Twice songs because of it!!\n* Cravity's Woobin has a great singing voice.  I recommend listening to his cover of Sia's \"Chandelier\" because it shows off his vocals really well.\n* Cravity's Seongmin has a unique voice because it's a lot higher-pitched and softer than most male idols' voices, but I just love it so much (yes he is my bias but seriously though, his voice is so cute and calming)",

So beautiful.  It has a soft yet strong feeling to it.  I wish I could describe it better! His solo telescope is so nice. \n\n\nAnd I was really surprised by how much I liked Moon Jongup\u2019s voice when I listened to his solo album.\n\nI\u2019m not as much a fan of women\u2019s voices, but I really like Mamamoo and IU.",

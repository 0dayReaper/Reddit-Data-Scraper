Personally, I just became an all-in fan when \"moonlight sunrise\" debuted on YouTube. I'm a hetero man, Gen-X aged, single, &amp; American. And sure, my interest began from attraction (nobody can deny TWICE's beauty factor)... but immediately after? ...OMG I am so hooked on 7 different K-pop girl groups' music &amp; videos now!! TWICE is certainly an excellent gateway into this genre.",

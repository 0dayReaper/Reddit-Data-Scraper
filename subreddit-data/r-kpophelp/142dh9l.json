Songs and concepts follow trends and it's hard to find a group with their own unique identity anymore.  I've found myself shortening my list of groups I stan simply because not many are keeping their unique sounds and making songs with a structure I like and lots of groups just make \"trendy\" songs that are short, have no bridge, and have weird antidrops instead of real choruses.  Now I know this isn't often the idols' fault since they don't always write and produce their own songs (especially in girl groups, it's rare to find the members getting involved in writing and producing, which I find unfortunate), but it's still annoying that talented and skilled idols have to perform songs that will just get forgotten after a couple months.",

Yes there is that, but no, no bridge =/= cutting a song short.  \nSome of the songs are still 3 minutes and not 2:40, they just use that time differently.  \nLook at something like ditto, it goes right into a shorter chorus after an intro, the structure IS different and not just removing a bridge.  \nYes, sometimes it can be about streaming length and basically just removing parts for short run times, but one cannot say that is all there is to this either, it IS an artistic choice too.",

I have recently looked at song lengths and there broadly (among the top ggs) seems to be a trend over the past years, to make songs shorter on average. (SM seems to care the least about that with aespa / RV).  \nI was just trying to make a point that it's not the sole explanation for cutting bridges as some people suggested here, i think there is artistic merit in trying to choose different structres, it depends what the song wants to be.  \nAnd as i said, i think always having the bridge, at the place you'd expect it, in the way you'd expect it, that also sounds artistically uninspired. That isn't me saying i don't want any bridges, not at all, just that it can be its own negative, it all depends on execution and vision.",

Lots of groups I think the bridge is kind of \"there because it needs to be\" but for my favourite songs the bridge is a transformative part of the song that really changes the vibe and moves to song forwards. Bridges where you blink and you miss it or its sonically very similar to the rest of the song don't have the same impact\n\nAnd agreed about SM! They're holding up the long song agenda for me, I ult wayv and stan aespa/nct and I love how many songs are towards the 4 minute mark their songs feel impactful and are written with purpose. SM groups also have some of the best bridges in the industry imo \n\nI'm not totally opposed to shorter songs or bridge-less songs but in general, shorter and no bridge ends up impacting other parts of what makes music enjoyable to me",

But do you think the recent trend of missing bridges is in any measure because songwriters suddenly decided they would experiment with structure more? I rather doubt it (especially since the people still doing bridges are generally also the same ones that tend to experiment the most musically).",

The song just has to end in a satisfying way.\n\nTake TXT\u2019s latest album, Temptation. None of the songs on that album have a bridge, yet they all progress and  end in a satisfying way for me as a listener.\n\nThe problem with Bite Me, one of the examples you listed OP, is that the song didn\u2019t end in a satisfying way. It just\u2026ended. As a listener, it wasn\u2019t ok because the song is well made until that lackluster ending.\n\nSo in theory, no bridges on a song can work as long as the producers can make the song satisfying to the listeners.",

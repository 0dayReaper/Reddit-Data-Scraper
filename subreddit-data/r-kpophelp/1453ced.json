But usually, i see that people do split it into three. With jongho being the actual maknae, so they dont call him the \u201cmaknae line\u201d. then the 99z, and hyung line is hongjoong and seonghwa. I think jongho being the only 00 liner is also part of why people group it by halves, to be able to have like a real \u201cline\u201d i guess, rather than just jongho all alone. If we were technical about it, ateez doesnt have a maknae line, only a maknae.",

Personally i think it would make more sense if we split ateez into three (matz, 99 line, jongho) but for concept pics, i understand if atinys would want to split the group into halves (i think it looks nicer and more organized that way!).

Its sort of misleading too, because theyre just the *younger* half, not the actual *youngest* out of the whole group like maknae actually means, so i think it actually would have to be referred to as hyung line and dongsaeng line to be technically correct and more accurate. i could be wrong though, so anyone thats more knowledgeable about honorifics is welcome to correct me.",

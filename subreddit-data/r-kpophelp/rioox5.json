    "postText": "Today marks the 4th year since the passing of SHINee's main vocalist, soloist, and producer, Kim Jonghyun. Jonghyun struggled with depression to the point where he took his own life. \n\nThe holidays and gloom of the winter can make this time of year difficult for many. If you or someone you know is having a mental health crisis or simply just need someone to talk to, know there are people and resources out there to help. \n\nFor users in the US: Dial 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) to speak with the suicide prevention hotline. \n\n[Mental Health America](https://mhanational.org/) is an organization with resources to assist those in need of mental health services.\n\nFor those in the UK: [https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/)\n\nFor those in other countries in the world: [https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp](https://findahelpline.com/i/iasp)\n\nAnd if possible, please consider donating to [The Shiny Foundation](https://www.shiny.or.kr/) who sponsor and work with artistic youth in Korea like Jonghyun with mental health services and encourage their growth and prosperity. Their services have also expanded to scholarships, emergency assistance and supporting young artists without an agency.\n\nJonghyun spread his love and light through his music and artistry. Tell him he did well today and say a prayer to him and all those he touched with his music. Winter doesn't last forever. \n\n[Rest In Peace, Jonghyun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ea5VDQfXg)",

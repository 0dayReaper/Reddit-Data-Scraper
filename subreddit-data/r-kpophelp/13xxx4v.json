Producing and composing does not make you a non idol or a real artist in particular and it\u2019s also a fact that 99 percent of idol groups do not write their own music so idk what you trying to do coming up with groups that do when I bet you don\u2019t even Stan them",

And they do not simply make the same music at all. Iu and akmu title tracks sounds completely different from what modern kpop sounds like in the first place and most kpop fans will even call them bsides musics or cafe musics and label them as boring because they are simply not the same genre at all.

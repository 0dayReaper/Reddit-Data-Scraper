Hypothetically, how difficult would it be to book Yunho, Changmin, Jaejoong, and Junsu for a \"corporate event\" or \"private concert\" in Japan?\n\nBasically, how do we show that there's high enough demand for an OT4 reunion???",

There is enough support for all four of them.. Basically, there's no reason to do it unless there's a clear push from the fan base IMO. So I'm curious why the Korean Cassies haven't pushed to do this? Or is the Korean fan base pretty done with J&amp;J at this point and blame them for the split?",

                            "comment": "Korean fanbase is a pretty vague term to use because the fans are split too like the band itself. We have JYJ fans who are still pretty protective of J&amp;J. These two has been through a lot since the split. These fans saw how they were blamed by own bandmates and SM artists. I don't think they are very enthusiastic of supporting other two members to the extent of pushing ot4 to happen. The same applies for homin stans.  They seem to be pretty content with this current \"tvxq act 2\" as Yunho mentioned once. At the time of split, things were very messy. Feelings were hurt not only members but also fans. Sure, the members seem to have got over things now especially J&amp; J. But I doubt they are willing to perform together again.  OT 4/5 fans also exist, they want the union to happen, but I guess this group is not as strong as individual fans.",

Even between two JYJ members, when was the last time they release anything together? They all have different paths for too long.  \n\nAlso about their fandom, with how the group fell apart, their fandom also divided into 2 or 3 parts and attacked other side, since they viewed other side as traitor. Most of OT4 fan if they can survive until now are all busy with their life. They're no longer at age they spend money freely on idol anymore.\n\nI also don't deny SM maybe a factor as well. When H.O.T reunion, SM had to be petty to sue them over the group name. Who know what they will do about TVXQ?",

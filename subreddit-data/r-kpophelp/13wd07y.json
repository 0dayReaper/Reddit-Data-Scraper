I do not see anything clearing her or claiming her to be innocent. As far as I can tell, the actress who accused her of bullying has never retracted her statement. Lately on tik tok I\u2019m seeing lots of Justice for soojin posts. Is this just fans standing by their bias or was she proven innocent later?",

This is why most bullying cases have people believing victims, because bullying is so common and also underlooked in how to handle it and treat the victims. Especially when a traumatic day of being bullied for the victim is another Tuesday for the bully and they probably won't remember it and will obviously claim it never happened.\n\nDoes this mean, if it happened, she's a bad person now? Well, probably not, imo. Bullies often just turn into fine normally adjusted people. It doesn't erase that if it happened she might not agree that it did.\n\nAnd, in this case, Cube is the one accusing the victim and as such must prove the guilt of the supposed victim.",

I was accused of bullying when it wasn't me and even grammar wise was very far away from how I wrote. I told my teachers if they wanna punish me for that with no proof, fine but I'm not gonna let it slide. \n\nI never found out who it was but it was be absolutely ridiculous if I messaged their company to get them fired. Soojin was never proven to have physically hurt anyone, some people just clearly wanted to ruin her life over petty middle school drama. Her reaction and Cube's were far from perfect but she didn't deserve to be fired over any of these. Unfortunately I feel like too many kpop fans can't grasp that life outside of school exists yet.",

I was a fan of Soojin and loosely followed the whole thing, because with Korea you never know who the victim actually is, but the whole thing was another Wonho situation.  Unfortunately she didn't even try to explain herself and didn't have the media do an investigation like dispatch did for wonho.\nI think she was too hurt by CUBEs decision and maybe decided to completely leave her place in the industry.  CUBE obviously has a lack of care for their artists. The Hyuna Dawn situation is proof enough, but they probably kicked her out without thinking twice about it. \nThe bullying cases were trending, ao there were accusations thrown left and right, but it really is beside me how nobody actually conducted a proper investigation and came out with an official statement.\nAs a victim of bullying, I personally think that Koreans lumped every bad behaviour into one. Underage drinking and smoking is too funny to me, because most people do it. They show it as proof to be a bad apple, but this isn't necessarily true. Not only that, but being butchy and bullying aren't the same leven of an offence. If there was verbal bullying, that is definitely terrible, but thinking about hs, a lot of kids had a pad period where they said some not so nice things to each other. \nNot only this, but Soojin was apparently \"seen\" with this girl's bullies at a later time and didn't do the actual bullying at all. I think it's hypocritical for netizen to want someone's career to be put to an end, because of that. Most people at aome point have hung out with the wrong crowd, especially if they had a hard time themselves. \nI know for myself I stood far away from people i considered mean, but it's not like I've never talked with them. If someone says we've hung out, does that make me as bad?? Idk...",

She was accused of several things. \n\nCertain bullying accusations (there were a few victims and several situations) were actually investigated by the school and She was proven innocent in that investigation. \n\nThen Cube sued the alleged victims, so Cube needed to show proof (not the victims) and they lost that case as it was said it could be seen as bullying from the victims side.\n\nThe deal with the actress is the actress made a statement that Soojins friend group bullied her during a certain school year. It was the year after Soojin removed herself from the group so someone messaged the actress about that and the actress said she wasn't 100% sure who was in the friend group at that time. So people saw that as super shady. \n\nThe nail in the coffin was Cube losing the lawsuit against the victim and The Actress making her statement but it all felt very inconclusive.",

                    "comment": "Yeah basically that entire year after the AOA bullying scandal, a whole slew of bullying accusations came forth. Soojin was one of them. She stated while she may have not been the most model student (underage drinking?, smoking), she never bullied anyone. For international fans this is not as big of a deal as it is in Korea where they associate such behaviors with unruly students and bullies. It honestly may not have blown up as much as it did if it hadn't been for an actress (actresses tend to be more respected than idols) saying she was bullied by Soojin. \n\nThe actress later clarified that her friend from high school said she saw Soojin with the actress's known bullies trash-talking her, but later that friend backtracked saying she was not entirely sure if it was Soojin, and the actress also followed and backtracked her statement. But, by that point, the damage was done.  \n\nSoojin's main accuser went to court but the police basically made the conclusion that it was a \"he said she said\" situation where there was no proof either way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, the lack of proof and the main accuser that catapulted it to the level it did (the actress) retracting, along with the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is what leads to a lot of i-fans feeling like Soojin was more of a victim of public sentiment at the time of rooting out famous bullies getting away with their misdeeds. \n\nI will also say, with how ridiculously violent the term bullying is associated with in Korea, even more mild instances like trash-talking or rumour mills (still horrible mind you), once labelled as a bullying instance, are treated to the same severity as perpetual physical violence (head in toilet, covered in bruises, money stolen, blackmail videos, etc.) because of how so many in the past have gotten away with such instances of severe bullying behavior with even teachers looking away in Korea. \n\nA punch back at your bully that has been tormenting you for years in the West, could be interpreted as a bullying situation rather than self-defense in Korea due to the culture of trying to root out intense bullying in Korea (with people thinking they can get away with it). Idols are also held to crazy different standards when you also consider their place in geopolitics as well (seen as a representation of the country). \n\nI think most think she honestly would have had a similar situation to maybe Lia of Itzy or Hyunjin of Stray Kids and could of found a way to still be an idol, even individually, but the outcry after the actress's statement took it to a whole nother level of public outrage.",

The term for bullying translates to school violence, and even if you chew someone out who did the same to you before, if they complain you get processed by the school violence committee. Then it's on your record and people will react to it the same as if you beat someone up for no reason. There's no layers to it, even though there technically are severity levels, in the case of idols people hear school violence and do not care about anything else.\n\nIt's so frustrating to me because of course I would care if an idol was a real mean bully at school, but I don't care about arguments, scraps or stupid rivalries they had going on, but it seems like most of the cases that came out are more like that than targeted ongoing torment.",

Yudimi has alleged that she has been bullied by Eunseo since elementary school. The school violence report is Eunseo's side of the story, Garam and her friend are allowed to oppose the story if they disagree or if it is incorrect (which you can see they do) but it is important to keep that in mind when reading it. That it is not an unbiased account of what happened it is Eunseo's side of what happened, which is why the story does not go into the abuse Eunseo committed against the girls before.",

But, by that point, the damage was done.\n\nSource? To my knowledge the actresses' most recent statement on the matter (in direct response to Soojin's demand for a clear statement from her) was that it was not just an isolated incident that she heard second hand from a friend, but something that occurred over several years. If there is a reputable source that reports otherwise I would be interested.\n\n&gt;**For two years, that person who mentioned me constantly said groundless insults and personal attacks about me** such as, \u201cI wonder how she is a celebrity when she\u2019s not even that pretty,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a celebrity who\u2019s past her prime anyway,\u201d \u201cNo wonder she is an outcast,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what the teachers like about her that cause them to give her special treatment,\u201d on the way to school, in the hallways during breaks, the cafeteria, every day and anywhere with a group along with unpleasant cursing and snickering laughter. It could\u2019ve just been envy and jealousy of young students and words they said in passing, but they are words that have caused deep pain in my heart and remain with me to this day. The pain I received back then gradually grew into a bigger bruise, and I started to develop fear of people. That fear became trauma, changed my personality into becoming introverted, and it is true that it also became a great barrier for entering high school. It made me realize that not only physical violence but also mental violence can remain as everlasting pain in someone\u2019s life.\n\nShe also seems pretty certain that it was Soojin.\n\n&gt;She says she does not remember and has never spoken with me, and that is true. They were just one-sided insults. **I think it is unfortunate that she is drawing the line even saying that she definitely did not do the actions or say the scornful words in her group behind me.** And I\u2019m not sure what kind of witnesses or evidence she has, but I want to ask if her selective memory is honesty that can cover up everything I am talking about.\n\n[https://www.soompi.com/article/1461231wpp/seo-shin-ae-writes-personal-statement-about-school-violence-from-gi-dles-soojin](https://www.soompi.com/article/1461231wpp/seo-shin-ae-writes-personal-statement-about-school-violence-from-gi-dles-soojin)",

But apparently the main differences in the story is that the bullies she keeps mentioning (as confirmed) she says were Soojin's friends, and Soojin's statements was that she had not been friends for a long time and was even outcasted from them because they were bullying others. So a lot of it was more other people's accounts of whether Soojin was actively their friend when they were bullying her (joining them in spreading rumours) or had she been an outcast from those people at that time. The actress believed her friends that Soojin was part of the group that bullied her. And I honestly think there were people on both sides confirming and denying it in terms of whether Soojin was involved. This, I believe, was not related to the main accuser's situation from my understanding.",

            "comment": "As Soojin was (and still is) my favorite K-pop idol, I followed the entire thing from the very day it started. There isn\u2019t a conclusive verdict - the general consensus people lean towards is that she was innocent. That being said, you\u2019re free to believe what you want, but not in blindly doing so which *a lot* of people did without looking at the facts.\n\nAgain, she was never proven innocent or guilty, but most evidence shows she mostly likely is innocent. Her lawyer\u2019s statement from September 2022 revealed that she was cleared by her school\u2019s violence committee after being accused of something she didn\u2019t do. Not only that, she was bullied by seniors and other students in school. In the beginning, it was said that Soojin had once been SA\u2019d by a male student.\n\nWithout trying to be biased, I think Soojin was just part of the wrong crowd. Teenagers are gossipy and it\u2019s normal to see that. It was said that Soojin did leave the group she was said to be part of that \u201cbullied\u201d others, and later found new friends. I can relate in a similar way as I was part of a friend group in school that caused a lot of trouble, though I wasn\u2019t always directly involved myself. Cube has a terrible track record of failing to protect their artists and hastily throwing them away to fend for themselves. It was their own fault that they let Soojin speak for herself - I do see that as being very noble and brave (and I commend her for that), but at the same time it really wasn\u2019t a good decision because it assisted in her downfall in the end. \n\nSoojin\u2019s accusers are laughable imo. She was initially accused by a former classmate\u2019s elder sister - she said that her younger sister fell out with Soojin and then started to be bullied by her - even though the elder sister cursed Soojin down the phone and threatened to kill her (despite Soojin being only 12 and she was around 20). I believe this falling out stemmed from the classmate taking money from Soojin and not giving it back, so Soojin (understandably) cursed at her over the phone, to which the elder sister stepped in and took it too far. She then went on to say her younger sister developed some sort of illness because of Soojin\u2019s bullying, but that said illness is hereditary and cannot be caused by such a thing (from what I remember of reading). The two sisters went on Instagram Live and even laughed about the whole thing, and danced to DUMDi DUMDi by (G)I-DLE (despite the elder sister saying her sibling was so traumatized she couldn\u2019t bear to listen to Soojin\u2019s voice or any (G)I-DLE songs).\n\nApparently there were a few (but not a lot) of times when bullying accusations against Soojin surfaced, including one during (G)I-DLE\u2019s debut days, but they never garnered attention. Soojin was accused right after the release of \u201cHWAA\u201d, which was their most successful release in South Korea at the time. The group started to become very well known. It\u2019s not surprising to assume this is when the accuser(s) thought it\u2019d be the perfect time to accuse her again.\n\nSeo Shinae is the catalyst in all of this. If she hadn\u2019t stepped in, I doubt it would\u2019ve gotten so bad to the point Soojin left (G)I-DLE. She lazily posted a vague Instagram story after Soojin was first accused, saying \u201cNone of your excuse.\u201d People put two and two together because it was known Soojin and Seo Shinae went to the same middle school. Shinae was known to have spoken of her experiences of being bullied at school. It didn\u2019t help when Seo Shinae sat by and didn\u2019t bother to explain what she meant, or who it was about, while Soojin was being torn to shreds online. She eventually did indirectly confirm it was about Soojin without mentioning her name, so she couldn\u2019t be pulled into any legal situations. She stated Soojin talked badly about her at school, and that\u2019s all she shared. Based on this, if that\u2019s all she has to accuse her of bullying, I frankly think it\u2019s disgusting because what human doesn\u2019t talk badly about another? Especially in your early teenage years and whilst in middle school or high school. It\u2019s reputed (though not known whether this is true or not) that there are screenshots (and a video) of Shinae talking to a Soojin fan on Instagram, and she backtracks her statement by claiming she isn\u2019t actually sure after all if it was Soojin who talked badly about her.\n\nAt the end of the day, the entire case was badly managed and dealt with. I just hope Soojin is living in peace now, that\u2019s the most I\u2019d need if I were her tbh.",

People can change. A lot of times people who were bully\u2019s were just hurt themselves. Is it unfortunate that the bullying occurred to begin with ? Yes, as a victim of bullying myself it really fucking sucks. \n\nBut people change. And only clinging on to it makes you a miserable person.",

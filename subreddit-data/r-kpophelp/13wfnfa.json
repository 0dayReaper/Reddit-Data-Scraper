Because she was so popular, she had a lot of haters too. Left and right people accused her of being \u2018rude\u2019 because of her resting bitch face, which I think stemmed from people actually being jealous of how gorgeous and popular she was. Nowadays Momoland as a whole is very under the radar so it makes sense that she isn\u2019t talked about very much. If she were in a different, more popular group, I think her popularity would have a lot more longevity.",

But I saw it being talked about around here somewhere because people were mad about someone comparing the popularity to Taemin's Move. It's all about the 'neighborhood' of the fandom you're in",

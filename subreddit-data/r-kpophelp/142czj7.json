            "comment": "well i guess, its just the other commenter said, Boys Planet tecnically did better than Girls Planet in terms of views but i believe that are a lot of factors that contributed to this tbh, usually male survival shows have a loyal female fanbase especially inside Korea and on top of that Mnet ended up going back to their roots with this one, so there was no more \"cells\" and everything. Besides the fact that theyve been formed through the same show,  they are gonna be label mates so ig ppl just thought abt comparing both, and honestly i dont think this should even be made because both groups are in extremely different positions at the moment.",

Their Here I Am and Say My Name dance practices don't have a lot of views because they'd already performed them at KCON. For Kep1er's O.O.O dance practice, it was their first ever group content after the GP999 finale so people flocked to it. ZB1 got TikTok videos, vlogs, KCON appearance, magazine shoot etc all before their dance practices, so it wasn't as 'hot' anymore.",

            "comment": "Honestly 90% of songs in kpop are about love, and there's a large range of concepts about love. They range from love shot (exo), cupid (fifty fifty), BEcause (dreamcatcher), attention (newjeans) and more. It's a huge range.\n\nMaybe narrowing down the concept/message that you want might help? Such as deeply in love, unrequited love, or a past love etc. I'll be happy to help",

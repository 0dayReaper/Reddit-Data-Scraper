    "postText": "I'm thinking of exploring AI in K-pop, where should I start? I also want to know everyone's perspective on this. The AI concept is not new to K-pop, and I've been seeing many people to be very accepting of it, why is this so? At the same time, there are also those who fear its possible takeover. What could AI mean to the fans, artists, and the industry as a whole?",

There are groups that have a so-called AI *concept* like Aespa and Mave, but they do not actually have anything to do with AI just like Ateez don't have anything to do with real-life pirates or piracy just because they have a pirate concept. Mave use 3D modeled avatars for performances which are superimposed on the members in photos but they're real people; Aespa has Naevis, an AI/NPC character in their lore, but she (so far) isn't involved in their music nor is she part of the group.",

AI Art generators steal from the corpus of many artists to feed the algorithm to \"make\" new art which is unfair and unjust to actual artists.\n\nThe concept of digital/virtual idols aren't exactly new (from Hatsune Miku to Apoki) and along the way, AI would likely be eventually used to make such personas to be more independent. But, AI to make compositions? Vocals? Lyrics? It won't be supported at all.",

            "comment": "I think the first thing you should know is that they're not actually AI lol, most are virtual avatars with some CG characters mixed in. \n\nThe second thing is that while I think it's a great alternative for idols who don't want their personal lives exposed to the public it can't fully replace the parasocial connection fans have with regular idols. \n\nSome groups get close, though. I think that Plave has done a really great job of using avatars and still keeping a good relationship with their fans. They use VR suits so it's basically the same as a regular group just with avatars instead of their real faces. I also think Superkind is doing alright, the Nukes felt a little weird at first but they've recently been doing a better job of incorporating them with the real members (I also think it helps that there's more than one Nuke now, Saejin used to feel very separate from the other members but having Seung makes them feel more a part of the group). \n\nI think these two groups are the best place to start, maybe along with MAVE because they seem to be the most dedicated to the concept (the \"AI\" members are full-time members as opposed to Aespa or KDA). MAVE is probably the most \"AI\" among all the ones I mentioned but they don't have any content outside of performances, whereas Plave and Superkind have a lot of non-music content (especially Plave, they go live all the time and you can watch them back on their official channel).",

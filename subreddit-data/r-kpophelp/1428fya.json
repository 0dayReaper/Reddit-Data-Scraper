But he also walks a good balance of bluntness and grace.\n\nWhen fans or antis get out of pocket, he has no problem calling them out but he is never inhumane in the way that he handles bad situations or bad people.\n\nHe is a very respectable person who wisely uses tact when and where it is needed.",

He doesn't care if he seems like a bully to Hyunjin in the behind-the scenes-footage.

He told that fan, \"That's not a good dream.\" Another time Seunghoon and Seungyoon were doing a vlive in their van. They were wearing hats and some fans asked the two to take them off. The boys told them off and said \"No, we don't want to take off our hats. We are wearing them for a reason.\" \n\nOver the years, the fandom has learned to respect Winner's personal space because Winner and the fandom has reached a level of understanding and respect of personal space. Because of this, Seunghoon does whatever he wants at concerts and nobody invades his space.",

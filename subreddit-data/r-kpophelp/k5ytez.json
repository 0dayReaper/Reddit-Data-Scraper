    "postText": "I love kpop in general like the groups I listen to are so positive and they make me feel less alone in the world and tbh sometimes I feel like Korean songs are more diverse than western songs. However, recently I started to get embarrassed that I listen to it like my friends and family laugh at it  and say \" even though you have that weird obsession with kpop, I am still friends with you\" and I feel weird about it like it's not an obsession it's just something I enjoy... And then I start to think maybe it's like \"childish\" for me to listen to this music and put my favorite group as my wallpaper but then again I still enjoy it. \n\nIdk this might not be the best sub to vent or whatever but I thought someone might relate to this feeling.\n\nEdit: I panicked and didn't know which flair to put.... Sorry if it's the wrong one\n\nEdit 2: Wow, I really didn't expect many responses, it really made my day and confidence increase so thank you everyone also that you to the people who have me my first award.",

                    "comment": "**On the flipside:** I used to be like your dad (sans the xenophobic stuff since I'm Asian) -someone who disregarded K-pop - when I was in highschool and college to the point that I didn't get why people listened to songs they couldn't even understand (I'm Asian but not Korean). Tons of K-pop groups went to my country and I totally didn't care because I heard a few K-pop songs in 2011/2012 and never liked them. I kind of **teased** my friends too for even listening to songs with incomprehensible lyrics. It just stuck with me that K-pop wasn't my style and I'm an \\~\\*indie rocker girl\\*\\~ lmao. \n\nFast forward to 2020 and I started watching **K-Dramas** to see what the buzz was all about. I instantly got hooked and finished over 60 dramas from January to present, that's how addicted I was. I even studied Korean through Coursera/Yonsei so I could understand conversations without subs. \n\nHowever, despite liking Korean dramas and movies, I'd somewhat promised myself not to listen to any K-pop since music is \\~ sacred \\~ to me (as a musician) and I thought their voices were heavily autotuned and, of course, I couldn't listen with subs on anyway. \n\nThen, I saw the drama **It's Okay That's Love (2014)** starring Jo In Sung and Gong Hyo Jin. One specific actor apart from the leads caught my attention for his great acting but I thought he was a kid then since he looked young and played a highschool student. Checked the cast and it was **D.O.**, apparently an **EXO** member. Oh cool, I thought. \n\nFast forward to July this year, I listened to one EXO song (you can easily guess, it was Love Shot) and I couldn't stop listening to all their other songs. Obviously they're my ult now. I ventured from EXO to their other sub-units, had 1 Billion Views on one of my top songs in 2020, and now I'm collecting all the EXO albums and versions ever made with a smile on my face (pun intended). \n\nI feel so terrible for disliking K-pop all these years and even missing not just one but two EXO concerts in my country. Although EXO is my ult, I also deeply love BTS, Monsta X, Stray Kids, SF9, Red Velvet, and other groups. \n\nI came from the other side who laughed at people for listening to K-pop but guess where I am now lol. \n\n(Sorry for the long story and for being one of those bullies! Agggh regrets)",

I didn't watch any K Drama (for 15 years, yes!!!) or listened to any K-Pop songs (maybe unless it was Gangnam Style because I think the whole world listened to that at one point). I'm definitely, DEFINITELY not a homophobe, but I always thought looking at male idols' photos before--WHY DO THEY ALL LOOK LIKE GIRLS? WHAT'S WITH THE EARRINGS AND HAIR COLOR? WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THESE PEOPLE. I had ZERO interest, and there was a bit of indifference there even.\n\nThen sometime this year, I saw all these people watching and talking about Crash Landing On You (like people of all ages) and I got curious. So during a long flight to the US, I started watching it just for the hell of it and OH MY GOD IT TOTALLY CHANGED MY LIFE.  I've watched that show maybe 20-30 times since March LMAO. My top 5 songs on Spotify were all from the soundtrack. It totally saved my pandemic. This is what introduced me to Korean music.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago, I started listening to BlackPink songs (because they're so catchy) then expanded to a few more artists (but only the most popular songs) and I just started to listen to these pop songs on a daily basis (more so during city driving!). So I asked my friends for more recommendations then someone just someone randomly included LOVE SHOT and UNIVERSE in their song list (which also included BTS, SuJu and BigBang songs) and I'm like okay, let me see what this is about.\n\nIt was love at first song. SERIOUSLY. Love Shot just got me, and Universe reeled me in. EXO's amazing vocals really made me fall in love right then and there.\n\nAnd about a month after, I have 20 albums, a light stick, various photobooks and I'm about to spend all my money on an EXO spending binge for Christmas. IT ESCALATED REALLY QUICKLY FOR ME. I can't believe I missed out on KPop and EXO's greatness all these years?!?!?! Because my pride kept me from exploring more music?\n\nI feel bad. But now here am I and EXO is all I ever talk about... To be fair, I have like eight years worth of content to catch up on so this is gonna go on for a while. HAHAHHA I've had people unfollow me on Twitter and Instagram because EXO content is all they see from me. But to be honest---I don't care now. I don't care if I'm a grown woman who fan girls like crazy. You just have to do what makes you happy! So happy to be on this side now. &lt;3",

I just ask them \u2018would you like to hear some tunes?\u2019 or \u2018what style of music do you like and I\u2019ll match it with something Korean?\u2019  and \u2018who are you listening to, I know someone Korean that had a similar sound?\u2019.

I\u2019ll explain what I like about K-pop, K-hip hop and K-RnB then try to link it in with something I know they listen to eg a particular beat, bass line, vocal range, harmonies etc.  If they like dancing I show them the dance practice clips. I\u2019m not asking anyone to agree with me, or immerse themselves in K-pop (although why wouldn\u2019t you), I like to explain how the artists I like are skilled and talented.\n\nI like to remind people that luckily there\u2019s enough fabulous music in the world for everyone so there\u2019s no need to dis anyone\u2019s musical choices.  I just happen to like K-pop because what\u2019s not to love.",

They will always try to bring you down and to make you feel less than you are, especially if you do stuff that they don't understand. They do it cause they are afraid when you don't conform to what is expected of you be it behaviour, hobbies, appearance or in the case of music - likes or dislikes.\n\nI also think that there is a lot of unconscious racism going on when people make fun of K-pop fans, cause nobody makes fun of people that like Western pop music, do they?\n\nIf listening to Korean pop music makes you happy, then listen to K-pop, live your best life and ignore the haters because they are always gonna hate, hate, hate as Taylor Swift once sang so wisely.\n\nAlso remember, there are many of us that enjoy K-pop and go through the same stuff as you. I bet most of us have been clowned for liking K-pop at some point.\n\nMy advice would be to keep your head up, enjoy the cool MVs, the catchy music and the fun choreos and don't let other people's opinions spoil your fun. :)",

I don't know why so many people seem to think that once you hit 30, your life is over and you suddenly have to become a different person and drop everything you love and enjoy just because society has this idea that you're now too old to continue loving and enjoying those things. It's ridiculous. If someone finds it weird, it's their problem not the problem of the person enjoying themselves. Personally, I firmly believe that as long as someone isn't hurting themselves or others with whatever it is they love and enjoy, who cares. People should focus more on themselves rather than sticking their nose into everybody else's business.",

I know that this genre comes with lots of stigma ,but in the end doesn't matter if you don't let this to bother you. Is important to not feel guilty about what you like because in the end you can't really control this.\n\nI must admit that, firstly I couldn't embrace me liking kpop, because I have a certain image in the eye of my friends that comes as elitist.People hold me at certain expectation just because I have very academic intrests from a very young age and that comes with the image that my \"taste\" is very refined or something.

It's 'cause some people make you feel like kpop is a less superior type of music than what they listen to. Like it's weird to be into music in another language or something. I eventually learned to think bigger like, \"Nope, nothing's wrong with you. You just have a very open-minded taste in music.\" People around me eventually learned why I'm immersed in this genre and culture altogether through the years of being with me and they too became open with it. Personally I enjoy being immersed in kpop and it's related categories because I admire the creative process they take in producing their music, arts and as well as preserving their culture. Being in the creative field (design and arts), I enjoy geeking out on their content. I learn and get inspired a lot especially with how they think. And it introduced me to soo much more beautiful things outside of my comfort zone. \n\nTL;DR - I geek out on things worth my brain and kpop keeps the gears going. Then I learned to be proud with my interests and people around me eventually understood without forcing them. And it's been going strong for 12 years and counting. Don't think too much of what others think. Just enjoy yourself and everything else will follow. \ud83d\ude0a",

I'm so glad that I listen to the music :)\n\nI had a lot of white friends who recommended kpop to me (and I'm asian!) and I'm so glad my mom (~50f) is also in the same boat with me about Kpop and Kdramas. How I overcame it is basically me being surrounded with non-judgemental friends and family.\n \nFor my family: my little brother likes to add K-Rock to his usual playlist, like Day6 and N.Flying, because it suits his taste and his friends have been nagging him to watch Start-Up so he did! While going through her chemo treatment, I gave my mom my viki account to share and she had been watching kdramas and cdramas more than I did. Eventually she opened up to BTS because she saw Hwarang and V became her bias loool. She considers herself a Blink and currently loves the recent album from Stray Kids. My dad? Well it's hard but he eventually got used to us.\n\nMy friends: from high school to university friends. We even planned from going to concerts to driving to LA for KCon. \n\nTbh once you realize that your music taste is just for your enjoyment and not for others, you'll be pretty much set to be confident to who you listen to.",

Being perceived a certain way is different from actually being that, those prejudices do not define you as a person.

            "comment": "I think I was lucky enough to live in an area where liking Kpop isn't highly judged. In fact, there's a Kpop club in my university. I didn't attend, but I noticed a lot of people join. I'm also lucky that my family don't judge my faves because I taught them that music of all languages is good and they're very open about it (they kind of judge when I buy their albums tho lol but I get it, it's physical CDS when most people just stream their music online). They also often listen to music of different languages so listening in Korean isn't any different.\n\nI think you just learn to listen to it and not care about people think. My cousin who isn't familiar with Kpop likes to tease me about it sometimes, but I just shrug it off and tell them off nonchalantly - I don't get in a large argument with them because it's not worth it (unless they're being racist/xenophobic - they're not, but if they were, I'd educate them). I post about my favourite BTS songs often on my IG story and people don't look at me differently - I just don't post about obsessively because I know posting about anything fandom related, Kpop or not, can be annoying.\n\nPut your idol on your wallpaper, listen to your fave artists unapologetically because at the end of the day, other people's opinions don't matter. I listen to a bunch of Kpop but I also listen to other genres - I'm like everyone else. Judge-y people think they're different because they don't listen to Kpop yet us Kpop stans aren't any different from them - we still listen to the same genres the majority of society listens to. We just happen to also like music in a different language. It's weird how they're allowed to listen to Spanish, Japanese anime theme songs, etc, yet Kpop is a big deal lol. I bet they wouldn't say the same if your wallpaper was like Ariana Grande or Drake. Again, I just think ignoring them is best. Don't let random people make you feel embarrassed for your taste. You should call them out tho about saying \"I'm still friends with you\" is a pretty shitty thing to say for something so harmless. Friends shouldn't be shitting on your hobbies/taste when it's not even bad. I hate when people equate me to fangirls who only talk about Kpop 24/7 - that's really a minority of Kpop stans smh.",

I just explained that I really like pop music because I love the production that goes into pop music. So I can love a pop song regardless of language because I value the production in pop songs over other things for the most part. \n\nThis kind of pop music isn\u2019t getting produced as much in the west nowadays the way it was in 2009-2010, when people like Katy Perry and Lady Gaga were huge. So naturally I\u2019m going to gravitate to a market that is supplying what I want. \n\nAt the end of the day, it all just comes down to taste, which is super subjective. Nobody\u2019s taste is better than someone else\u2019s taste because everyone is different. Just tell yourself that. You have the right to enjoy whatever you like (as long as it\u2019s not illegal lol) just like the people who hate kpop have a right to like whatever they like. Also every language is valid, so people who hate on it for being a different language (this isn\u2019t calling our people who don\u2019t listen to it because they don\u2019t understand it and prefer listening to songs they understand) are narrow minded and probably have a superiority regarding their own language.",

Even if they're \"joking\" they're mocking one of your interests, and that's not okay. I get that kpop is an interest a lot of people don't understand, but honestly it's the same as people fangirling/stanning American artists. The big difference is that kpop isn't in English -- but so what? You can like the way music sounds, and like the message behind a song without being fluent in the language. I'm Asian and unfortunately I don't understand my native language (I live in North America lol) but I still love listening to songs from my home country. No one makes fun of me for it, because I am literally from that country.. but listening to that music is the same as listening to kpop (since I don't understand Korean either), yet some people in my life still don't understand how I can enjoy kpop. \n\nBasically OP, please don't feel bad for liking kpop and thinking it's \"childish\". It's music, and we're all entitled to like the music that fits our taste. Honestly, sometimes I don't even understand some English songs until I look up the lyrics LOL (and I'm sure many others relate). \n\nWhat really helped me get over my initial embarrassment was having good friends that also liked kpop. I'm fortunate that I found a lot of people in my social circle who are proud and unashamed. It makes up for the people in my life who don't understand, and it makes me feel less alone. I'd encourage you to find some friends that also like kpop, whether that be in real life or online. \n\nWhen people mock you, tell them it's not okay. Maybe they don't understand because they don't know how kpop really makes you feel. Maybe sharing things with them will help them understand. Before I got into kpop a friend would always tell me how certain kpop songs helped her through tough times. I think for me, that's when I realized that being a kpop stan was more than just fangirling over someone's good looks, and I started to respect it a lot more and eventually became a stan myself lol. \n\nAnyway sorry for the long comment, I had a lot of thoughts. But I wish you the best of luck. You deserve to enjoy everything you love without being embarrassed! And you deserve respect and kindness always.",

I liked anime at that time and I was slightly picked on because of it already, but I already knew it was because my entire class was conformed by homophobic xenophobes (since I didn\u2019t question those behaviors, I too was xenophobic (not homophobic thoug)), so I first learned to separate the content from the artist or creator. After some time they changed their focus to kpop and I distance know what that was, so when they asked if I was into it I just simply said no, but discovering something that they didn\u2019t like as well got me curious and decided to listen to some songs and I fell in love with everything. After questioning how come they didn\u2019t like it, since the music was really good in my opinion, throughout a school year I recommended some kpop songs in english to my classmates without them knowing that it was kpop. I came to the conclusion that, some didn\u2019t really liked the songs (which is completely fine) and some actually did like them, but when I said it was kpop, all 25 students said that it was garbage. So now every time i get hate for listening to kpop, i would think that it is one or the two outcomes before and i\u2019d just stop caring at all. I don\u2019t really express that I listen to it all the time, but if anyone ask, I say yes, because there is nothing wrong in liking different cultures and music.",

Unfortunately, I was an ARMY for only a year and I told her I wasn't interested in them anymore. Yet she didn't listen to me. So much so that when DW News mentioned that achievement (I forgot) of Dynamite, she literally came into my room to tell me that. \"So? What do I do with this info?\" (I'd awkwardly laughed) and she replied, \"Just wanted to congratulate you. Because you're their fan.\" And I went ?_?\nI also remember once when I was watching a Ryan Higa video on YouTube, she was like, \"Oh god! You're listening to BTS again!\" And I'd felt so offended.\nTo this day, I regret my decision.",

That awesome I feel lol \nI used to be very alone and I have some anxiety problems so kpop really was the best thing that happened to me. My few friends don't like kpop because they don't understand the language but they don't make fun of it. Yeah, I hear some people saying kpop is gay or something but I don't let them bother me bcz I know I can't change their mind.\nWho is making fun of kpop or make you feel ashamed of liking it, they are just sad and have no idea what they are missing. \nNever be ashamed with what you like, everyone is different. Everyone here has such a great taste.",

But when I'm home listening to kpop on speakers, I usually mix it with English songs so it kinda just becomes music and not just Korean music you know? But yeah it's a biit embarassing even though I wanna overcome that haha. Same with anime songs lol",

It helped that Kpop was gaining a positive reaction because of BTS (they\u2019re my main group) alot of people found their MV\u2019s and performances interesting so their perspective changed from cringy fan- service boys to boys that are actually hella dope artists. \n\nPeople are judgemental but if you find real friends you can slowly open up, and sometimes you will find friends because of it kpop. Most of my bffs now are because of a bts concert from 4 years ago \ud83d\udc9c",

I listen to a huge variety of music from classical to techno to jazz to rock to metal and even to K-Pop. I do have friends that look at me weird because at times I do \"stan\" some artists when I get really hyped by the music or dancing but hey, thats what its for, to enjoy. Anyone that criticizes you on it just want you to change to their standard of what is real music. Music is whatever emotionally moves you and K-Pop has its place for it.",

            "comment": "For me I\u2019ve always been openly expressive about me being into kpop since my older siblings were really into it when I was young. I was exposed to kpop ever since I was young and it\u2019s just not really a problem to me if you enjoy kpop because you should be able to express what you want and what you enjoy without any judgments. I honestly thinks it\u2019s kind of petty for your family and friends to not be as supportive of you being a kpop fan just because it\u2019s out of their norm and they\u2019re uncomfortable with it. If they\u2019re really your friends and family they wouldn\u2019t be so judgmental about what you want to like and what you don\u2019t like. Also it\u2019s good to try and to not care about what anyone thinks because if you really love kpop not only because of their looks, but for their message and content so be it. You get to choose what you want and need in your life. I understand that it seems like an obsession to like kpop, but it\u2019s not always like that. There\u2019s a special connection that brings kpop and kpop fans together. It\u2019s an experience and being a fan of whatever group doesn\u2019t matter as long as you know what you really stand for and believe in as a person. Always remember you are the main character of your own story. I really hope you read this, yet you probably won\u2019t get to it because there\u2019s so many replies to this post. Anyways I tried my best to explain and give you some small advice out of pure empathy. I hope you\u2019re happy though.. really I do !",

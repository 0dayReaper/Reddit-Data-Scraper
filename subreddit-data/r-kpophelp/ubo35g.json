Jin being the quite mysterious visual that people could project their ideas onto. JK being the cute baby. V being the 4D member.\n\nJin is no good at being quite or mysterious, which as a fellow Sagittarius, I understand. V does fit the 4D mold idea but being called 4D, weird, or Alien made him feel bad. JK was a baby at the time so it was appropriate, but they also tried to limit the amount of muscle he put on. The problem being JK is very active, and has a body type that builds muscle mass easily. And poor Jimin. Being told to be the \"tough guy\" seemed to take a toll on him in the long run. He is remarkably resilient and sassy, but like he was coming from a modern dance background and didn't even have armpit hair when they debuted. The traditional hypermasculine aggressive tough guy image wasn't for him.",

I think some non-fans had also mentioned it. But the company agreed and told him to stop wearing eyeliner, start wearing hats, and to rap less intensely so he could have a softer image/persona. This always irked me because I think one of his most charming points is his duality on stage vs off stage (where he naturally seems like a softie). Thank god I think they\u2019ve dropped that nonsense now and have let him be himself.",

I think that she isn't really forcing the cheerful persona as if the company told her that this is her character from then on. Rather it is that she already is that character, but external sources forced her to continue to play that persona *indirectly*. But I think some of it has to do with internally as well.\n\nI think she herself wanted to continue to use that cheerful personal and in result, felt pressured by it to keep that persona everywhere. She even [talked about it once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8KiXi-XdQY&amp;ab_channel=308KPOP) that it was difficult for her to open up to she's down because she naturally wants to put other's emotions before hers. Imo a pretty common thing for people who are naturally cheerful and energetic.\n\nSo yea I think she was kinda forced to have (or more accurately, continue to have) the cheerful persona, but I think the company has less to do with it and it's mostly internally.\n\nBut ofc with a bright/energetic persona usually means they have skills in entertainment, and thus more gigs (she's hosting a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChK2DhvPSG3sY0jIYYngVBA) as well). So in a way, indirectly 'forced' to continue to play the cheerful persona by the company.\n\nEdit: edited some sentences for more clarity",

Watch her in Running Girls and she is straight up crying talking about being forced to be bright and happy all the time--and this has been beaten into her so much she never stops smiling even when crying.\n\nShe's not the only one. Hyojung (OMG) and Yuju (Gfriend) are the same way with giant smiles as almost no other expressions are allowed to cross their faces. Though Hyojung, different from the other two, does have a 2nd, crying face, in addition to the giant smiley face she's forced to put on.",

Anyways it's really funny to see his Wanna One clips and then his clips in Nu'est because you can tell the difference: Like it's the same person but living in clearly a different context. In Wanna One he is this handsome hyung who the youngers can rely on and in NU'EST he is just a pretty random dude that embaraces the human meme concept lol (like don't misunderstood me, NU'EST fans appreciates his talents and visuals I'm talking about personality).",

This cold prince thing was very common for boy groups.\n\nThe other boys had assigned personas as well, I believe Jimin was supposed to be very masculine, I don't remember why, could be because he was well built or because he was from busan.. Or just because. Taehyung was supposed to act like idk not very normal compared to the other members, the crackhead I guess. And Jungkook with the baby persona, I feel like sometimes this still happens but I think that's just his personality and the editors like adding baby sounds lmao",

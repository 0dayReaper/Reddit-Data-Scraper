Calls like \"Let's go\", rappers changing parts of their verses, adding a vocal run where there originally wasn't one. So why not talk about that instead of calling backing vocals ad libs, I don't understand how it evolved into this",

Comeback in the west is reserved for an artist who fell out of the spotlight/struggled for years after being famous, then rose into fame again with a hit song or album.\n\nThe whole thing of every new release being a comeback was sooo confusing.

Main Vocal is the one with the best skill and a distinguished voice to be recognizable, they are usually called on to do adlibs. Lead vocals are stable enough to take whole verses and delicate parts, like the bridge or pre-chorus. (Sub) vocalists will take smaller parts because they lack stability to manage more than that, but their vocal quality is still desirable. \n\nI could go on to explain it in terms of the dance line as well. Main dancer should be the dancer which catches the eye the most of the dance line. Lead dancers are responsible for knowing the choreography and determine the pacing for others to follow. The Dance Leader is completely separate from either Main or Lead dancer.",

Privileged. \n\nFor example?\n\nActual nepotism:\n1.) Sunny from SNSD. Her uncle is Lee SooMan, AKA the CEO and founder of SM entertainment. There were physical connections between family members and the jobs the family members presented. Shes extremely talented, but this is where nepotism can actually be said to be a factor. \n\n2.) Seo JiYoung. Her dad was the president of Yonsei University (one of the top universities in Korea), and her grandfather was the Minister of National Defense and the President of the Korean Baseball Association (like the MLB). A company (Sharp i believe) created a brand new group just so they could debut her, all because she decided she wanted to debut in a group for fun one day. \n\n\nPrivileged:\n1.) Bahiyyih from Kep1er. Her brother is under HYBE and mentioned her in a vlive while she was participating in a survival show. The survival show was based on audition, and she passed through the required talent auditions. Could be due to her name? Well, then its not her that's using it. Just like Sieun from StayC or Izone/LSFM Chaewon or T-ara Boram or any other idol that had famous relatives and was initially noticed for that but passed through due to their own merit. They can't control what other people choose to do based on their family. \n\nConsidering Bahiyyih's case, voters voted for her. And there were enough fancam views to back up the fact that people were genuinely interested in her. Considering that was the only requirement to get votes (it wasnt a talent competition, it was a popularity competition), she was voted through on her own merit. \n\n2.) BlackPink Jennie/Lisa. Or basically ANY rich idol that came from a really good background, like Mark from GOT7, Wonyoung from IVE, Chaeryeong/Chaeyeon, etc. Theyre privileged to have come from money, where they can get expensive lessons, and be introduced to important people through their important professors, and learn from the best of the best, look their best through skincare/makeup/enhacements, or whatever else. \n\nThis is not nepotism, its just a privilege they had, that gave them a leg up to THEN get by on their own talents and merit. It doesnt matter how much help they had getting there, they still wouldnt be there today if they didnt put in the hard work and then be approved by either the general public or the companies management.",

I can't express how infuriating it is.\n\nAnyway, other words that lost their meaning are \"flop\", \"monopoly\" (seriously, people... HYBE buying some SM stocks isn't gonna make them a monopoly), \"queerbaiting\", \"mistreatment\", and my underrated favourite... \"EP\".\n\nSeriously, companies...

It\u2019s kind of nice because a number of music shows do not allow any personal camera use at all.

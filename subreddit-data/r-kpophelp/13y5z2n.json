    "postText": " \n\nHelp guys! I'm this desperate to recall the title of this song since I've been singing this in the office non-stop huhuhu please don't make fun of me :(\n\nThe melody kind of sound like this \"lalalalas kunde, lalalala jiji mayo, lalalala SOS\"\n\nFrom what I remember:\n\n* I think that is the start of the song\n* The end of that line has the word \"SOS\" and they usually repeat that line within the whole song\n* From a boyband around 2007-2012 I guess huhu I used to sing this when I was in college\n* Kind of a song for a commercial or kdrama ??\n* Kind of a summer, upbeat song\n\nThank you for your future help reddit friends! Have a good day",

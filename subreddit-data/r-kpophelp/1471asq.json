Since soundcheck tickets get in earlier, you'll also have time to shop before gates open (usually at 5:30",

I\u2019d suggest getting there around 330 tbh - I didn\u2019t have soundcheck tickets, but I got there around 4 for sofi and was in line for a like 1.5 hrs but wasn\u2019t able to get merch beforehand :/ \nthey also might do a merch sale the day before at the venue? If they do, do that for merch instead! People were saying that they were able to get their things within like 30 min the day before",

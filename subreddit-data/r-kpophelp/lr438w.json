Staying consistently blonde is way less damaging than going black to blonde like Taeyeon has though. Once your hair is bleach, you only have to maintain the roots and then use color correctors (which are almost always conditioning). But changing light to dark colors several times a year is a horrible idea and normally no professional would recommend it.",

Hwasa is the one who has gone the longest without bleaching her hair, having had a natural hair color since the 4 Seasons era. Solar actually cut her hair at the very beginning of 2020 to [an incredibly short bob](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F7Pf1eWuGrW5Fkl5Vjl2A6r3TFRlxNCZAs_4_YlltjoT6DJHe25tAf_BRl7_WDQKRdyWFWm2aL3UkZXh_8ACakYDKjf_aTQJ4A=w960-rj-nu-e365). But she messed up by bleaching her hair again for her solo comeback and that's why her hair started breaking off.",

I honestly forgot because it was black for most of Queendom. \ud83d\ude02 Hwasa has cut her hair a lot so it's hard to tell how long it will grow. She wears a bun often these days so it's hard to tell how long her hair is now but I bet it's not much longer than at the beginning of the Hip era. There's a [video](https://youtu.be/ubdu9cf5VLo) of her for her spread in W magazine and she talks about her hair care, among other things,...but the English subs haven't been added yet.",

There are many Kpop idols who have confessed to them balding and having bald spots because of hair dye. Some have started balding as young as 20 because of hair dying. Plus some companies use filters to make the hair of the idols to make them look nice and healthy. Also some idols may use Hair extensions because it definitely is possible some idols hair unfortunately falls out. Even if their hair is done professionally it still is extremely damaged unfortunately:/.",

Before dyeing it blue, you have to be blonde first. So, it basically counts as 1 hair color lol. \n\nAlso, other idols who are into coloring their hair often is at risk to have thekr hair damaged. I remember jimin saying that he has to stop constantly changing his hair color because it dries up his hair. \n\nGood alternative would be the temporary color spray, what yoongi used during \"Run\" to achieve mintyoongi lol. \n\nTo add, I think these idols get topnotch haor treatments anyway to lessen the damage brought about by not just coloring, but of constant styling: hair straightening, curling, hairspray etc. Company has to invest in topnptch haor treatment.",

And a lot of colours fade back to a semblance of blonde so u dont have to bleach every time. Blue and green r the two worst offenders. They dont fade back to blonde and would require a rebleach. Several actually. I rebleached my hair twice juat a month after dying my hair blue and it was still blue afterwards. Just lighter. \nIts the bleaching that does the damage. If they go from having bright green hair to silver blonde then theyv probs melted their hair rip\nIf theyv stuck to pink, red, or orange (even some purples and silvers) then theyr hair is probs not in that bad of a state. \nHair does grow pretty fast tho and especially male idols probably can restart the whole process every 3-4ish months",

I've noticed recently a lot of idols are leaving their roots natural too, which really minimizes damage.",

The hair dye itself shouldn't damage your hair - it's really colour stripper, bleach and heat that ruins your hair if you overuse it. Obviously some idols hair is absolutely fried, but it's possible to have crazy colours and keep your hair healthy. Gowon from Loona going from blonde to green is a good example, along with Jungkook going from blonde to blue.",

The semi-permanent colours can be left on for hours and do nothing damage wise (I watched a youtuber who would leave Manic Panic dye in her hair overnight which I personally found a bit weird lol but it won\u2019t do anything bad). It\u2019s only the bleach that is going to damage hair and as long as you don\u2019t use it often, it tends to be alright in most cases. Plus you only really have to do the roots after bleaching it once and unless you\u2019re the lightest shade of blonde there is or a pastel colour, you can get away with not doing the roots for quite some time.",

I don\u2019t have Asian hair but the principles are the same:\n\n- Olaplex or similar protein treatments will make strands healthier after bleaching. \n\n- Unless you\u2019re over-bleaching at the scalp, as in, bleaching it so so much that it dissolves the hair, the hair won\u2019t fall out at the scalp. The good salon pros that idols visit aren\u2019t going to overbleach them to baldness.\n\nBleaching damages hair and can also damage the scalp, think blisters and skin sensitivity. But it does not stop the hair growing from the follicle. It doesn\u2019t cause baldness. For idols going bald there are other factors causing it. And the appearance of thinner hair from over-bleaching broken stands isn\u2019t baldness as the hair will still grow bar other factors.",

When you attack your scalp with bleach, your hair follicles lose their pigment cells, and you will go grey quickly. \n\nSo from experience, if you want to avoid going grey quickly, please buy a wig. They are more cost effective and depending on quality can be better looking than bleach dyed hair. \n\nAlso, even if your hair doesn\u2019t go grey, the follicular will grow weak- the first 6 inches of hair I grew out when I went back to natural were so weak and I still experience terrible fall out, even with high quality natural products. \n\nTake care of yourselves my loves \ud83d\udc9b",

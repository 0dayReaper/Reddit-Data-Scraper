I have a lot of friends who are into it but I don't like to discuss Kpop irl, because a lot of times it can get \"obsessive\" or territorial way too fast. It's just way more tolerable on the Internet (ironically), because I can leave the convo any time I want. I'm a girl but I gravitate towards the girl groups too haha.\n\nThere are kpop discord servers where you can find other people to chat with. And Kpop concerts (when they start happening again) are fun places to meet other fans, especially K-Con.",

Half the time the stream is just hanging out watching kpop videos together lol\n\nAnyway you're more than welcome to join, and you don't have to worry because I don't allow toxicity or trolls in my server because I want it to be a place for everyone to feel safe and comfortable and have fun. :) \n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/yJz4dsZ)",

She must be stupid.\" things like that. One of my classmates was talking about her ex-girlfriend and he said he broke up with her because he didn't want to be with a kpop fan, she's not her type. People need to stop being close minded. If you are subscribed to other subreddits, people always make fun of kpop. That's disgusting, it's just another type of music. So I don't like to talk about it too much.\n\nEdit: I miss my old school to be honest. People were more open minded. We were listening to music between our lessons. Some girls in my class were always showing Kpop MVs in class. We said \"Kpop? Uh okay.\" We accepted to watch with them since they were listening to our music too. The first MV they showed us was \"Oh Nana\" by Kard. We liked it and it was interesting then they showed \"Mic Drop\" by BTS. We weren't into Kpop to be honest but we were like \"OMG, they're insane.\" when we first saw the MV. Then they continued to show us MVs and live performances everyday and I eventually became a fan. So people just hate it for nothing, you appreciate it more when you learn what it is.",

I found Kpop as a way to bond with my 20yo step daughter, who is really into Kpop, and pretty much anything Korean.  \n\nWhen I started it was cute, but I just pretended to be into it for my daughters sake.  After all, I was thrilled that I found something that she was so passionate about.  But then my wife got hooked....and then I got hooked.  Now I low-key stan a bunch of girl groups, and even lower-key stan TXT, Pentagon, and BTS.  I am planning a trip to Korea once COVID blows over to surprise my wife and daughter with tickets to see gfriend or Twice (or hopefully both), and I am not sure who will be more excited, them or me.  \n\nLiterally NO ONE that I know besides my wife and daughter knows what Kpop is, let alone stan's anyone.

I went to a Korean shop and found some photocards, on the train back home, he wanted to see those \u201cweird asian girl cards\u201d, so I showed him and this sounds cringe and clich\u00e9 but I think K-Pop has created a bond between us, something in common, even though he can be slightly racist at times.",

So, I tried showing them the best/catchiest songs I could think of, in the hopes that they would like it. I got several people to at least enjoy a couple songs, and one of them is a big fan of K-pop now.\n\nMy advice is just try and get your friends to like it so that you can talk about it together.",

I love that Kpop (at least the innocent surface level) is about the art, not politics or showing off your body. I just wish I had friends I could fan girl with.",

We were students so it was us hyping over new music and refreshing music videos. People thought we we're weird for liking such a foreign type of music. Fast forward 2020, kpop is a phenomenon and most of us are in our 30s , with a career but none will talk about kpop irl, unless it's with a trusted friend from back then, because of the stigma attached to it. Kpop being seen as something for kids, obssessive or immature losers people . Funny cause most of my kpop \"grown up\" friends are in very good line of works (think lawyers, judges, public servants and doctors) .",

For instance me and that friend went after school to our friends house with another friend to work on costumes for our end of year day thing but there was such ignorance when we started playing TXT crown and another song and I said it has english parts listen to it to the friend who is blind to knowledge and education of other languages which is a shame  proceeds to say \u201chow do u even understand what they say\u201d like fuck off i swear how do people not know what translations are oh my god it\u2019s actually so stupid to me like a majority of what me and her know about is indian programs despite being of another culture lmao but I see she never complains theirs subs even when it\u2019s another language and goes obsessed over Indian music like sorry it goes both ways what\u2019s the point in dismissing something ur not familiar with but proceed to do the opposite for the similar concept like what even is that type of behaviour like we grew up around that asian environment despite not speaking hindi but know bits so why can\u2019t u search up a few translations and accept that\u2019s really good for someone else instead of being ignorant about it like the rest of the ones who do the same lmao its such a fortune for us teens and elders to choose this lifetime to actually learn and adapt in other parts of the world to realise we aren\u2019t so close spaced and keeping a barrier because of a language felt hypocritical when that friend spoke 2 languages like me but then she goes and plays her breakup chill tumblr shitty music which all sound the same and expect us to enjoy it like nah it pisses me off.",

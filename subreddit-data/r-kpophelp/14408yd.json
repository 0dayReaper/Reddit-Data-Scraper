Haru talked about in on their most recent episode of Weekly Idol, Loha demonstrates it whenever she can, and there's at least one solo choreography video on Tribe's official channel where Mire gets to do locking again.\n\nEx-ANS/Major's Bian, Yoo Jiwon, is really really good at hiphop and iirc there are videos she shot predebut which demonstrate this; doubtless though she learned and got very good well before debut, so I'll count her here.\n\nUnsure about the following, in so far as idk much about them before fairly recently, but I feel I should mention them:\n\nWooAh are rapidly becoming beasts but I don't know if they've all been training so heavily and in street styles since predebut, but given Nana's capabilities my guess would be she probably has. Apparently Lightsum's Chowon did vogue or whacking predebut (I forget which atm), according to her profile during.. I want to say Produce? but I don't know to what proficiency or if she's demonstrated it anywhere properly. Also from Lightsum Juhyeon is an amazing dancer, but I don't know the details of her predebut experience cause I haven't seen a whole lot of Lightsum content.",

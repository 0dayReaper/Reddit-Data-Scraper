    "postText": "So there was this song back in 2020 called Headshot by an active artist known as Ja Mezz. But weirdly this song disappeared like a year ago and no matter where I look I can\u2019t find it. I know I\u2019m not crazy because I still have the song on Spotify, but it\u2019s just been greyed out and I can\u2019t play it. There are also some platforms where the song is listed but unplayable. Like I can find traces of it here and there but I can\u2019t play it if that makes more sense. Anyone know what happened to it?",

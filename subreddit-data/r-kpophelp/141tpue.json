    "postText": "Hey guys, I would love to watch some TVXQ stuff (particularly OT2 since I prefer more \u201erecent\u201c stuff if you can put it like that??) \n\nBut all I can find is some videos on Kocowa, compilations of so many different videos and variety shows on Youtube, but most of them are quite incomplete snippets of whole shows I cannot find anywhere to watch. \n\nDoes anyone know a page or an archive where I can watch full videos (preferably with english subs) like full variety shows, challenges, live streams, creator videos or any other stuff like that? Just that general stuff you usually find on any other artist\u2018s Youtube channel?\n\nIf you got a link to such a page, I\u2018d really appreciate it if you could comment it down!! Any archive, any link to dailymotion, just anything. I\u2018m desperate for content lol, thanks in advance\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

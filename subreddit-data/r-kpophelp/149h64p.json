Not all kpop but a big chunk of it is. Mood description: *\"Lazy morns &amp; late eves. Salty ocean breeze &amp; bonfire smoke under a clear night sky. Celebration &amp; relaxation. Staying cool and refreshed. Vibrant energy &amp; swelling affection. Joy &amp; carefreeness. The moment &amp; making memories. Falling in &amp; falling in love.\"*\n\nSome example tracks:\n\nCelebrity - IU\n\nHighway To Heaven - NCT 127\n\nKick It - BP\n\nShake It - Sistar\n\nKAZINO - Bibi\n\nGood Life - WayV",

    "postText": "I know idols go on music shows all the time to promote their latest title track. I was wondering if anyone knew what their typical schedule looked like. I know they have some down time where they can go out to meet other idols, but how much is spent getting ready, being in standby mode, and actually performing?\n\nI'm just curious if anyone has any ideas. Thanks for reading! &lt;3",

There was a huge van opened briefly with multiple wardrobes\u2026 and later that day he recorded another music show with different hair and make up. I\u2019d imagine it was a grueling 24hrs if not more.",

I know some times idols perform and then have to come back for when they hand out awards, so what do they do in between and do they have to get more makeup on and get ready all over again? Also idk if anyone knows about how much down time they have in between when they have to show up again on the show.",

They really only get a couple of hours of sleep during comeback week(s) between filming, performances, and content for socials.\n\nThey wake up super fucking early. As early as 2am or 3am. Though normal is probably between 4-5am. They have to do hair and make up which can take a long time. Get dressed. Probably do sound check of some sort. Do social media filmings/picture taking (think TikToks and instagram). Filming which can probably take a bit if they do a couple takes. If they\u2019re nominated or sticking around for the ceremony win thingy. \n\nAfter filming at one show, they\u2019re off to fan meets/signings. Filming for other shows for promo. Then probably another music show filming. Maybe eat if they\u2019re lucky. Then go to bed around 11pm or 12am. Wake up a couple to a few hours later to do it all over again. \n\nIf an idol is doing something to support a friend/family during comeback week(s), they usually get praise for it because they had to squeeze that in to their schedule when they\u2019re already so busy.",

            "comment": "It depends if they are pre-recorded performance or they also do the liveshow portion. Depending on when they are slotted, they would be there at 4 am or maybe earlier , but it can also be later. They would do rehearsal about one or two - wait in between for their turn, then for pre - recording as well, they would wait for their turn ( they would usually catch up sleep here but sometimes they would record skits for the show as well) . If they are not slotted for the live, they usually go after this ( sometimes straight to a radio show by noon ). If they are for live show as well its gonna be another long ass wait again (maybe another rehearsal or skit recording). (Either sleep or do other things) . Anyway, if they are there for live show,  they will be out by 8 sometime later. Sometimes they may be radio show at night. So idols mostly get back late.",

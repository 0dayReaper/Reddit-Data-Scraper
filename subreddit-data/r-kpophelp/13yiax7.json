Most people that love kpop want to share their favorite artists/songs when someone shows interest. Don't ask us.\n\nSecondly, after getting some of the songs she recommended, ask her for a song that can help you with working out. Working out is always needed. And at the same time, it's a follow up question about her interest.\n\nAnd last but not least, dont become a cringey kpop fan, dont copy other kpop fans that dress weird (some sort of comic con / 'I want to get bullied' hybrid) thinking it's kpop style. What actual kpop style is is basically luxury clothing lol. So save up some money and dress well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

But if you listen to some of this and you like them, better to search for similar things instead of checking the whole list. For example, Monsta X, EXO and BAP have the same vibes for me. So yeah, good luck with your search, and I\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll find something you like, theres a lot of groups and songs with very different topics, vibes and rhythms after all",

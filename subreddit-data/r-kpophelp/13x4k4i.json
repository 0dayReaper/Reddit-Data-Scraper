I would like any recommendations for songs to be arranged into a piece.\n\nSome of my posted arrangements include [Thanks](https://youtu.be/W9IgOYJgTCY) and [Don Quixote](https://youtu.be/D8y7HfuCcV4) by SEVENTEEN and [Pirate](https://youtu.be/_OxTclYVmuY) by EVERGLOW.\n\n(I am okay with Title Tracks and B-Sides of any group)",

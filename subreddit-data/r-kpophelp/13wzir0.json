    "postText": "Hello! Lately I've been seeing some videos that show what percentage of each group's fandom is male or female and generally it seems like boygroups attract more female fans and girlgroups more male fans,\n\nHowever there are girlgroups in which fangirls outnumber fanboys (Mamamoo and Red Velvet are regularly brought up) and girlgroups where it's basically fifty fifty (no pun intended) which got me curious: is the opposite true for any boygroup? Are there any boygroups with more fanboys than fangirls or at least boygroups where it's 50/50?\n\nTell me what you think! And feel free to promote your faves \ud83e\udd23",

Went to the men's room at OnlyOneOf's show just to find a bunch of girls in there because the women's bathroom was full with a line. Needless to say they were embarrassed and shocked when three dudes came in haha, they apologized and said they didn't expect boys to come to the show...",

As a fast toilet person who is a girl, the lines in the ladies are always significantly longer cause women just take longer on average (+ take their friends with them, I'm guilty of that too).",

Some of them don't even like K-pop particularly, but they feel as if they're different from the other K-pop groups they've seen and didn't care for. One of the most hilarious--and ultimately annoying--recent reactions was from a duo who sampled DoJaeJung and got hung up on \"how many bitches these boys must get\" because they're so pretty. They didn't want to know more about the \"boys,\" beyond their sex lives. Seriously, they asked viewers to tell them more about that side of the scene in the comments. But they did love \"Perfume.\" I had a feeling they wouldn't know *what* to do with \"Kiss,\" though...",

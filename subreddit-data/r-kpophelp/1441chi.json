    "postText": "Hi, title may be weird and this is very specific but I'm looking for kpop songs that sound like they would be played on the radio all over Europe during the summer. \nI had this feeling when i listened to Fire in my Belly by Le Sserafim and FNF by Stray Kids. \nI also just added Connected by Bang Chan to it, but does anyone have any other suggestions? \n\nWould love to add them to my playlist!",

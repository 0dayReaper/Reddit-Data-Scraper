    "postText": "Every year I become obsessed again with [Fly High by Dreamcatcher](https://youtu.be/39yeTdIuKJU). It\u2019s very nostalgic and just beautiful to me. \n\nDo you have any songs similar, sound wise or in feeling? I\u2019m trying to chase that feeling the song gives me again.\n\nOne song I can think of is Rough by GFriend. Maybe it\u2019s my personal attachment/memories, but I feel the songs are a bit similar. I can\u2019t exactly describe the feeling well in words, but these songs feel alike in vibes to me.",

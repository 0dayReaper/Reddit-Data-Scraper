            "comment": "I have been into kpop for a while, and my \u201csolution\u201d is that honestly you just have to keep looking for a group until you feel that same connection. Don\u2019t force yourself to like or stan any groups or anything if it doesn\u2019t feel right, sometimes that group might not just be for you. If you really want to try again with that group, or really like their music and want to feel that connection with them etc etc, you can always come back to them another time and see if you feel different. I\u2019ve had this happen with plenty groups, I might feel neutral and I listen to them casually, then one time I might watch an mv or a performance and bam! I suddenly see them in a different way, I feel that special feeling, I\u2019m obsessed and now that group is all I think about haha\n\nThe best way that I find new music/groups to get into is just usually browsing YouTube or various kpop reddits, but a good way is getting recommendations from friends who are into kpop too! If you don\u2019t have any kpop friends, I\u2019d always be open to help, just tell me groups and songs you like and I will try my best :)\n\nAnd if you have any other questions since you\u2019re new to kpop, don\u2019t hesitate to ask!",

There\u2019s thousands of groups out there, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find some more ones you like, so don\u2019t get discouraged just because you don\u2019t feel like stanning some of the most popular 4th Gen groups right now.\n\nAnd as I said, if you need any suggestions, you can just ask me here for suggestions, dm me if you want a less public setting, or just post on this subreddit!",

I like songs from plenty of other groups, but I\u2019m not doing deep dives into their discographies or watching their non music videos. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s particularly uncommon to have a couple of groups/artists you really like, and to not be overly attached to anyone else.\n\nIf you want to expand, though, I\u2019d recommend something like Spotify. They have a lot of playlists that are based on particular subgenres, which can be useful for finding groups that are similar to the ones you like.",

I just couldn't find any spark in other groups although i like some of their songs. Im a casual listener to some well known ggs but my heart is still with mamamoo.  They made it hard for me to stan other groups bec of their talents.It feels like nobody compares to them nor even be in their level.\nNo offense to other groups, all of them are talented. It's just my personal preference.",

If they click, maybe check out that group and see if you want to delve deeper into them.\n\nAlso, it's okay to be a \"just\" a fan and not \"stan\" a group.  The groups I \"stan\" have fluctuated over time, but I groups I'm a fan of (casual or otherwise) only grows as I discover more music.",

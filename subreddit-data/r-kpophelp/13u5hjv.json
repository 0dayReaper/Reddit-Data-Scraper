I\u2019ve only heard about the situation when it blew up, and it was right after their comeback so I was kind of surprised to see how quickly everything escalated (or was that normal?) and I was just wondering about um.. the timeline\u00bf? of everything.  I'd also like to know (if possible) how did the \u201cprotest\u201d happen? like did their fans pay for those trucks? Was it planned by a small or by a huge group of people? How much were international fans involved in this? Were they aware of what was going to happen or were they surprised by that? \n\nI really tried to look up some stuff on twitter so I don\u2019t look stupid writing this but it was hard and time consuming having all these questions answered by just going through tweets (besides I don\u2019t just believe anyone's words and it\u2019s hard to fact check when you know nothing or where to look for facts). I appreciate any answer in advance, thank you!",

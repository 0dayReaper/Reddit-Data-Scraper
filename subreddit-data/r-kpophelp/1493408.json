    "postText": "Hi guys, i need urgent help!!\n\nI purchased 2 x BP VIP Blink plus tickets on Tixel for their Australia Sydney show this Saturday. \n\nToday I got an email from Tixel saying that they didn\u2019t know VIP tickets couldn\u2019t be resold so they have reversed the sale and will refund me \ud83d\ude16\n\nI am travelling interstate for the show and have booked flights and hotel! So, this is a big setback if I lose the tickets \ud83d\ude2b \n\nThe seller is still willing to give me the tickets but we are not sure what to do. I have emailed AEG and Ticketek asking if there\u2019s a way around this. \nI am thinking if tickets cannot be resold I may just have to attend the show and hope they don\u2019t ask for ID at the venue. I\u2019m at me ends. \nLet me know of what I can do and thank you in advance.",

I am hoping that the venue doesn\u2019t check for ID \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe seller has now gotten the ticket back since Tixel reversed the sale. I\u2019m hoping they can contact Ticketek on time to get the tickets transferred to my name (then no need to worry about ID) but if not, we might just have to do ticketek share and hope they don\u2019t ask for ID.\n\nAlso we did a direct bank transfer for full ticket price (no Venmo in Australia). We used Tixel as a second means to verify the tickets (charged fees for that, so refund is those fees).",

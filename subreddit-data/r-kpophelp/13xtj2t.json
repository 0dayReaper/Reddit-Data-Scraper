    "postText": "There's a girl group music video that's been stuck in my head for ages and I would love to know which song it was. \n\nI watched it probably sometime beyween 2014 to 2016. The girls wore like white sports jerseys with black numbers on the front and big pink or red bows on the back. Additionally I think they all wore black shorts/hot pants and one member had short hair, I think blonde or white? I think there were around five to seven members in the group.\n\nI'm honestly not too sure about the details but I vividly remember the big bows on their backs because I thought they looked really pretty.\n\nFor the longest time I thought it was the mv for \"Angel\" by BerryGood I was thinking about but I recently rewatched it and it's not it, but it would probably have been by a group with a similar concept/sound.",

    "postText": "So a few years ago there was this song I kept watching over and over on YouTube but I cant remember the name of it. I'm not sure but I think it wasn't available on Spotify at the time. It was by a male K-Pop idol and it was filmed in a studio. The studio was in a purple-reddish light and I think he wore a bucket hat. It's a very short video and mainly rap. I remember the title being a word I heard somewhere in history lessons as well, maybe greek? But I really can't remember anything and I'm dying to know \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nEven the tiniest hint is very much appreciated!",

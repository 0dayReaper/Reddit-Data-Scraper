    "postText": "I live in the countryside of Japan so I don't have opportunity to see concerts because I have to travel and the expenses are heavy. \nBut there will be a full NCT concert in September and I want to go.\nMy worry is because even with a sort of stable job now, I'm not sure if I will have the day-off and budget when the concert day arrive.\n\nI asked someone I know about it, and she said that this concert is not available in the official ticket resale website, so I'm really anxious of buying the ticket and not going \ud83d\ude25\n\nSo I would like to know now if there's an alternative and how to do it before I buy a ticket. Thanks!",

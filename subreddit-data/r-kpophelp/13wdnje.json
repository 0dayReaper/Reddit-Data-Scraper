    "postText": "So I\u2019m going to the Twice concert in LA on 6/10 and my CBZ has paint on it from a decoration attempt a while back. I think it looks really ugly so I wanted to try taking it off. The good thing is that the paint is super stuck to the actual handle part, so I managed to scrape a good bit of it off without damaging the base. The problem is that it takes WAY too long scraping and I want the paint off before the concert. Any advice is appreciated!",

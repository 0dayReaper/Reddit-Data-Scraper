It was the official logo. I also remember someone in the comments mentioning Jisoo (or potentially Ros\u00e9) had a PinkPunk sticker on their guitar.\n\nI have since tried to find this clip and cannot find anything, can someone help me find it (or tell me if I\u2019m just making it up lol)?",

I think it was only Lisa who kept the PinkPunk stuff. \n\nI can't help with the live but if you wanted to see the PinkPunk logo here's a pin of Lisa with the ukulele (and a time an iKon member borrowed it).\n\nhttps://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/579557045773822572/",

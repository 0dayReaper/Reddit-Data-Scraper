There isn't even a Wikipedia article for it...  \nIt just feels odd to me, is there any reason in particular? I'm not a Dive, just a bit confused.",

The overall public usually doesnt tend to check the japanese releases, it usually tends to receive only the attention of the own fandom and ofc the japanese fanbase.",

It might be a \"in your circles\" thing. I keep forgetting Wave was being released and might not listen to it for a bit since IVE is not a group I'm actively seeking new music from. \n\nHonestly, it wasn't until I became a fan of Twice and started listening to their music did I realize groups in general can have a whole ass Japanese discography and sometimes Japanese versions of their title tracks. Twice's recent Japanese single Hare Hare is super popular amongst the places I visit across the net (twitter and reddit) but not particularly well known outside of Twice/Once circles.",

Add to that the fact that groups releasing in Japan don't have the same avenues of promotion as they do in Korea. There aren't 12,000 music, variety and radio shows for them to hit up. They mostly do fansigns, magazines and performances for promo and those things aren't always recorded or easily available for fans outside of Japan.\n\nJapanese content also tends to be unsubbed and/or behind a paywall. It was only up until a few years ago that Japanese companies were holding something as basic as full length music videos hostage behind album and DVD purchases. And there's the fact that like OP pointed out, the MV came out weeks ago and the album is only now coming out. A lot of people just kind of forget and/or are confused by the spacing of Japanese releases.\n\nI also think possibly Dives were more focused on Rei coming back to promotions these past few days. (Not a Dive but I do keep up with the group every so often)",

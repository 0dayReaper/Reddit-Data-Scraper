    "postText": "I haven't been into K-Pop for very long, I became a STAY in the Maxident Era. For the most of it, I've done quite well with catching up to things. But for the love of God, I can't find where they announce concert dates or important updates etc. Also, it was my birthday recently and I decided I could buy the 5 Star album, but I don't know where to buy an original one. There aren't any K-Pop shops in my area so my only choice is to buy it online. I checked their original website but couldn't reallt find anything about it.\n\nSo far this is what I'm asking for:\n- Where they announce concerts and the dates\n- Where they let us know about important stuff\n- Where to buy the albums off the internet\n\nThank you so much in advance, I really appreciate it. :]",

We get to go in person but have also purchased online from them when we didn\u2019t have time to get down there (or the will to fight LA traffic). I love that store. Also there is Music plaza. Good website but not my preferred in person experience. &lt;3",

As a Canadian, here are the websites I use in order of preference:\n\n1- Makestar \n\n2- YesAsia\n\n3- Lightupk (only local physical store I can go to, I buy from them usually for the experience of being in a shop with hundreds of albums around me, or when I want to get a specific version or albums)\n\n4- Kpoptown\n\nThere is also interasia I've heard of that have good prices, but I never bought from them.\n\nI avoid ktown4u because of the high shipping rate. There's also many other stores you can buy from with benefits, look at your group's official account to see if they retweet stores' promotions. Following a fanbase from your country could also help get all the info and important stuff regarding your side of the world.",

Definitely recommend!\n\nStray Kids isn\u2019t on there, but Weverse is great for keeping up with other bands like BTS, Blackpink, Seventeen, Le Sserafim, TXT, NewJeans, etc. who do use it.",

So it's currently only in-stock on Korean sites,  or Target and Barnes &amp; Noble (if you're in the US). For local kpop stores, they usually get their copies about a week after release. But you can pre-order on their websites usually",

            "comment": "Hey, this is a great question! Most songs on spotify have translated names, so there are times when I don't know that they have hangul names with maybe a different meaning, so I went to look for some songs that I really like: \n- BTS - \uace0\uc5fd (go-yeob), which means 'Dead Leaves'. This song can be referred to as both Dead Leaves and Autumn Leaves so it's accurate.\n- BTS - \uace0\ubbfc\ubcf4\ub2e4 Go (go-min-bo-da Go), which means 'Rather than Worrying, Go'. The english title is 'Go Go', which is like shortening the original title. \n- ENHYPEN - \ubaa8 \uc544\ub2c8\uba74 \ub3c4 (mo ah-ni-myeon-do), which means 'All or Nothing'. The english title is 'Go Big or Go Home'; this imo is an awesome translation, like they mean the same but said in different words. Here is a [post](https://www.italki.com/ko/post/question-195823) I found that explains the meaning of the hangul better, as google translate literally translates it as 'mo or do'.\n\nEdit: I remembered another one:\n- IZONE - \ud574\ubc14\ub77c\uae30 (hae-ba-ra-gi), which means 'Sunflower'; its english name is 'Hey. Bae. Like It' which is a fun play of the pronunciation of the original hangul name (haebaragi = hey bae like it), though it is also referred to as Sunflower, which is the literal translation.",

How have you all gone about buying lightsticks?\n\nAlso, is this shop legit?\n\n[https://www.kyyo.co.uk/](https://www.kyyo.co.uk/)\n\nI usually buy from Sokollab, but they don't have a good collection of Lightsticks.\n\nHave any of you ever bought lightsticks from ebay? How can you figure out what is a legit Lightstick or a scam/fake? Like this one seems surprisingly cheap?\n\n[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225501021685?hash=item3480e885f5:g:lM0AAOSw88xkJFRc&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4LiPnVWy%2BaRgJ3ugy%2B4zPKjz5qd4NxM0xxTuP4p%2FEijByPUN29ceGMFenqFfatyQL53n2GvHs%2FnVyODAa4T2DYC6R3A33rEEAl6Abfc%2FgW5BAiyVhwLiipvb8e0pDtTGvSoSnJ9lyJiBEK5CWyLPC%2B4E4rDrDhSI0mOLCZR89IN5pHcrx75zBzMH7AkyVgk86ihWZfPAiYoICmGYHenyxhptC%2BjU6sTaB94IQwKK3D1CFvuP%2F7JcSd3cFbOzyDxfp7TkKIUAjdExn7yh%2Bw2zO2vzZfAl%2F%2FsOpepybhJYwquB%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR8rxvbaPYg](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225501021685?hash=item3480e885f5:g:lM0AAOSw88xkJFRc&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4LiPnVWy%2BaRgJ3ugy%2B4zPKjz5qd4NxM0xxTuP4p%2FEijByPUN29ceGMFenqFfatyQL53n2GvHs%2FnVyODAa4T2DYC6R3A33rEEAl6Abfc%2FgW5BAiyVhwLiipvb8e0pDtTGvSoSnJ9lyJiBEK5CWyLPC%2B4E4rDrDhSI0mOLCZR89IN5pHcrx75zBzMH7AkyVgk86ihWZfPAiYoICmGYHenyxhptC%2BjU6sTaB94IQwKK3D1CFvuP%2F7JcSd3cFbOzyDxfp7TkKIUAjdExn7yh%2Bw2zO2vzZfAl%2F%2FsOpepybhJYwquB%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR8rxvbaPYg)\n\nI saw this listing on Ebay, but I'm suspicious, because for most UK stores, the Candybong is on pre-order, but here it claims to be from Korea but the delivery is estimated for the end of June?\n\n[https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225590926270?hash=item3486445bbe:g:7o8AAOSwnnhkbz\\~C&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAAwM%2BwVqMnSY7siKsBbcedOaSf4K1lVOP%2FvyIweTtYg21rITkWP9xrdVVxfdXJXhxJvQ7xqc17j5WbX1njG2jROw7%2FTZy5nln%2B2W6ozmKXmXX%2F8OB%2FWDuSS%2Fj%2F29WDCOYYLiZEY9Jj2IpiOwacTIQkeWfkbRLjFrfqRLwboDgoJ3FiSMEVvg0TPbgq3Hy8VNb9cm17p8spFoT%2FiBc3oTKIci5MojDLoNMQrxoQLqBNjkEaOvXuoYSua7%2BVd7zdXvA7iw%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7j5lraPYg](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/225590926270?hash=item3486445bbe:g:7o8AAOSwnnhkbz~C&amp;amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAAwM%2BwVqMnSY7siKsBbcedOaSf4K1lVOP%2FvyIweTtYg21rITkWP9xrdVVxfdXJXhxJvQ7xqc17j5WbX1njG2jROw7%2FTZy5nln%2B2W6ozmKXmXX%2F8OB%2FWDuSS%2Fj%2F29WDCOYYLiZEY9Jj2IpiOwacTIQkeWfkbRLjFrfqRLwboDgoJ3FiSMEVvg0TPbgq3Hy8VNb9cm17p8spFoT%2FiBc3oTKIci5MojDLoNMQrxoQLqBNjkEaOvXuoYSua7%2BVd7zdXvA7iw%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7j5lraPYg)\n\nThank you so much in advance for the advice!",

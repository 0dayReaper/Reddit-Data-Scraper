You'd expect they'd all freak out and start jumping up and down and hugging each other or something like at literally any other awards show.  Instead, they just stand there smiling like it's no big deal.  Is this a cultural thing where they're expected to accept a win graciously with no excitement, or do they not react because they know they've already won?",

They have rough data from canvassing before the actual election, and they have people frantically crunching the numbers on the night as the results from different districts are counted. Sometimes the early data gets it wrong, but complete shocks are relatively unusual by the time the results are formally declared. When your career depends on a set of numbers, you get experts in your camp to do the sums!",

Since promotion times usually aren\u2019t super long the same people might\u2019ve just won another music show two days ago, so while it\u2019s great of course it probably won\u2019t hit them as hard anymore. \n\nAlso in some cases the wins are easily predictable due to the song in question having a huge leg up in certain categories from the get go or being the biggest contender by far.",

He was at home cleaning his  house. \ud83d\ude06 (That's so him) They don't anticipate winning those shows anymore due to so many newer groups competing and building their popularity. They only go there to promote their albums for the fans. It's just a bonus and a pleasant surprise when they do win. When groups get older their mentalities change. It's very obvious with SHINee why they've changed and the fans also changed too along with them. I have a feeling a lot of groups are looking at SHINee in how they handle being an older group and changing their outlooks on how they handle mental struggles and public scrutiny whether  its from fans or internet trolls.",

The Show can be actually tricky to win if more groups of same level (regardless of how nugu or mid tier they both are) are participating, but this time Dreamcatcher was in the lead in the lineup, by far (this isn't a drag for the other groups! it's just that, for now, the gap is noticeable and I think all groups knew it). By the way, I hope Kard can win a music show soon.\n\nMost fans are excited to see if Dreamcatcher can win today at Show Champion, but yesterday at The Show was a mathematical win, it was just a matter of going to the music show and collecting it. So the members were happy (you can see in thanking the fans and the encore) but in a more \"yee another win, let's go\" way, rather than a \"omg I'm shocked and this is SO unexpected\" way.",

During the pandemic for their first ever win, only the winners were allowed on stage after the announcement, so Show Champion staff and their own managers had to trick them into staying after their recording, going backstage before the announcement, then shove them onto stage straight after the result was announced. They were definitely very surprised and emotional.\n\nThey had even more of an emotional outburst at their first big show win aka Music Bank, shaky voices and teary eyes included. Then this comeback\u2019s win on The SHOW was again a tense moment since they had strong competition, and it was decided right down to the wire with live voting (they won by 29 points out of a full score of 10,000), and apparently since they were blocked by camera equipments they couldn\u2019t see the bottom total scores until the results were announced. Definite shock again.\n\nFor artists not used to winning music shows all the time, it\u2019s a big deal more often than bigger and more popular artists. So if you want to see more reactions, go for the smaller music shows like The SHOW or SHOW CHAMPION, and you\u2019ll see a lot more tears, hugging and shaky voices. But yeah the artists more than likely would learn the result at the same time as audiences in front of the screen.",

If his group is nominated that week, his cue card doesnt contain the winner\u2019s name. \nI agree on other comments, the group knows they are in the running, they can also calculate on the spot etc.",

            "comment": "Sometimes, artists know. Especially if there is no competition that day/week. For example, a solo artist or group with very crazy/strong physical albums sales is likely to win Music Bank these days if the other nominees aren't as strong. They don't know the full results beforehand. But there are certain indicators which lets them know if they have a very good chance of winning or not.\n\nSometimes the winners will react if they win, because they didn't expect it. You can watch the [Music Bank episode when ATEEZ won against NewJeans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Vpq7rD3AA) during summer last year. Or the [Music Core episode when HIGHLIGHT won against Itzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39_r3isgIc). In both cases, they didn't expect to win and had very strong reactions.",

When ateez won during Guerrilla era (?) we saw Hongjoong calculate the score before the final number was shown and from his expression, he knew they won. I think he does all the time but for this stage we actually saw him do it. \n\nOther times though, ateez are genuinely surprised. So overall I'd say no, they don't know.\n\nEdit: after reading the comments, I'm gonna say my take on this based on smaller groups and not digimons. They wouldn't have to do calculations for votes and sns to know if they have a chance.",

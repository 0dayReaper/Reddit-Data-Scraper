Just any songs you yourself can't hear without finding it cringe/a certain song that's so  u find funny, or overall enjoy despite it ^ ^ . \n\nFor me this would apply to Amber- Shake that Brass \ud83d\ude36.. I'd also say Wang Rong- Ching Ching, but that's not kpop like I initially thought... Still funny and cringe to watch lol",

I\u2018m more into NCT\u2018s older songs tho",

Even S-Class is a song I really can\u2019t get behind even though I really wanted to like it \ud83d\ude2d some of their b-sides on their recent albums have been good like Topline and Taste but what the hell was Youtiful. I actually laughed out loud when I heard it I know it\u2019s most likely my taste but imo it\u2019s just quite shocking \ud83d\udc80 \n\n\nMy second ult group is BTS and I can\u2019t comprehend how Dynamite, Run BTS, PTD all have the hype that they do (Butter is an honourable mention as the only heinous part of it is the \u2018smooth like butter\u2019 part) when masterpieces like Fake Love and I Need U exist. How the hell did the same group compose those songs LOL and can we talk about (G)Idle\u2019s Queen Card pls it\u2019s defo catchy but I can\u2019t even believe Soyeon got away with \u2018my boob and booty\u2019s hot\u2019.",

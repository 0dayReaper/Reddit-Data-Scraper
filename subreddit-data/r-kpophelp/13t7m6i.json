Songs by Korean singers? \nIf it's supposed to be an English Kpop song, does it have to be a song that was originally Korean but then got an English version? Just a few questions to think about. \n\nAnyway, I included a short list of English songs by Korean pop singers:\n\nBoA - I Did It For Love\nJYJ - Be My Girl\nTVXQ - Runnin' On Empty\nJYJ - Empty\nShinhwa - Perfect Man (English version)\nCLC - I Need U\nWonho - Ain't About You\nTiffany Young - Born Again \nTTS - Dear Santa (English Version)",

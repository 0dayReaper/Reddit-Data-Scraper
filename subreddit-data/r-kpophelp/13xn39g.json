She had learned Korean so whenever they saw her they would be so relaxed with her. She was always respectful but she did record her calls. I think intent matters. For those fans that stay respectful and do things like the calls to make sure the idols are being supported it's good. I know MakeStar often has calls where you can buy one with some of the smaller groups. It's a way for the groups to make money when they are not as popular as the big name groups. It's sad that they need to make money that way but at least it gives another way to support them. The crazy fans who act obsessed and stalkerish should be banned from calls though.",

It\u2019s fine to spend your money on what you want if you earned it, but there really should be restrictions and limits on fancalls/fansigns so everyone has a chance because we all love our idols and not all of us have the money for these raffles or fansigns.\n\nAlso, what do you mean about this MakeStar thing?

Heck, I went to see Mamamoo recently and knew that there wouldn\u2019t be a way for me to get a moo-bong because they just don\u2019t sell enough of them.

The lightstick itself too is in poor quality. There are many accounts of it being destroyed after it has been shipped, it didn't help the fact that the box of the bong was really thin compared to v1 and v2. There are also accounts that the diamond part of the bong is easily detached - many had experienced this last Caratland (their annual fanmeeting). Oh, did I mentioned that it was more expensive than the previous bong? Members specifically s.coups also expressed their discontentment in the latest lighstick and some members even refused to use the latest one and you can see it on their contents\n\nThat, together with the fact that they discontinued the bluetooth connection of v2 to the upcoming concerts is what most carats are angry of.",

This makes it so you are obligated to pay the high shipping fee. This is not the only items that require this. For certain items, you must check out before you can add more.",

The way this label treats fans is just such bullshit. \n\nThe Membership pissed me off because back then it was  mandatory to order it with the merch and it was just a magazine with a few ticket styled pics, a cheap 20 cents pen and a FOLDED poster. Istg the poster was the thing that finished me off. I paid 90$+ for it and customs and VAT... THIS WAS 80% OF MY RENT. and the photoshoot wasn't the movie photoshoot, but them sitting on a chair on a white bg. \nI vowed to never buy anything other than really pretty albums, but since suga is my bias I folded and bought the membership again for the ticket tour raffle, just to see only fansites winning it lol",

The Album itself is nothing more of a QR Code that you would have to scan on a specific app to listen to the album, and you can't even save it nor anything like a traditional album with CD, it's still a DRM Album. If the servers would have to shutdown in the future, you're just owning a useless paper card itself. \n\nI still remember that time when J-Hope's Jack in the Box album were only released in Weverse Album rather than a traditional Photobook+CD Album. That move was a response to the Environment concerns and eventually want to be more eco-friendly by just reducing plastic waste on producing traditional albums. But if that's the case, why bother continuing on making multiple Album versions on several Hybe artist if you want to be more \"eco-friendly\"?",

It's brilliant, from a business point of view. Exploit your customers, and watch as the ones who missed out blame, shame and ridicule them. And the fans just don't see it. Even in the 2nd or 3rd comment thread here people are shaming chronic fancallers instead of calling out companies for this business model. A business sets up a system where customers feel emotionally connected to their product and then allows them the chance at exclusive access to said product for literally as much money as they're able to spend. If you were in as deep as they want you to be and had the means, you'd all be spending thousands per fansign/call attempt. That's the entire point.",

I'm literally a Hobi stan and I loved his album, it's so frustrating that HYBE was so stupid that they wanted to experiment with only digital albums on his first solo debut... so incredibly stupid cause they went right back to physicals for Jin's debut. We could've gotten an awesome poster, photobook, etc. I hope in the future they'd at least make a physical version but I doubt it\n4. Weverse shipping costs. There's absolutely no reason for it to be that expensive, like costing twice as much as the item itself.. you wouldn't catch me dead buying off of Weverse\n5. Making new lightsticks when the current one is perfect the way it is... seventeen carat bong. The worst part is that fans fall for cash grabs like these every single time. I just got my v2 lightstick a year ago for the bets tour and I'm pissed that they're discontinuing lightsync for their next one..

So compared to everything else on that list, the gold coin is actually the one thing that is actually cheap (which I know is hard to believe given the price lol). My parents work with metal minting that\u2019s how I know this and I\u2019ve seen this misconception in ARMY spaces too where people think it was so expensive, and they\u2019re always shocked to learn it\u2019s not actually so.",

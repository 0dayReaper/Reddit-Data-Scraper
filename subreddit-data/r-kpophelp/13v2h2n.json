And Luna the main vocal of the group who is excellent dropped one if not the best solo album in the whole K-pop industry which is called \"free somebody\".",

They debuted back in 2014 so they have a huge discography, their older songs are very jazzy/funky and their newer songs play with a bunch of different genres and sounds like pop/latin/ballads (they\u2019re considered a vocal group so their ballads are absolutely beautiful, \u201cPaint Me\u201d is a great one)\n\nSome of my favs by them are Dingga, 4X4ever, My Star, Travel, and Egotistic",

            "comment": "They've been mentioned a couple of times already but to me, tripleS has a similar sound and vibe. They're a little different in how their group is made as they use the AKB48/NCT style of having a pool of trainees that's used to create subgroups (people get to vote on this) and they also perform as a whole group. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but the music and talent are top-tier. I find myself loving every song on their comebacks. People have mentioned [Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cZ7o0Wn_dc) and [Rising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErFpr-1vt5c) but let me mention a couple other songs I like:\n\n[Rolex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFf9zpH5ahc) \\- really fun song with great string intrumentation and  love a good stage mix\n\n[New Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuHMPd2dCW0) \\- So this may not be for everyone, but the 80's vibe is so strong on this song I feel like I can see Molly Ringwald dancing to it ever time I hear it.",

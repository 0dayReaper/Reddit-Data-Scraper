Then what about idols that do not participate in song writing? It\u2019s still their voices and their face in the music video, do they get cuts after leaving the company? \n\nAsking because I recently discovered many gen 2 groups. Interested in buying from iTunes. But if everything goes to the company then I won\u2019t",

If nobody buys music because \"the money doesn't go to my faves\" then that puts songwriters in a rough spot.",

This includes all singers and instrumental sessions.\n\nAccording to this article written by an indie musician / recording engineer, that\u2019ll be 0.336 KRW per stream, and that\u2019ll be split between other singers and recording artists according to the contract.\n\nhttps://brunch.co.kr/@audiotech/47",

Idols who left the company don't usually get any of it since they no longer have a signed contract with them.",

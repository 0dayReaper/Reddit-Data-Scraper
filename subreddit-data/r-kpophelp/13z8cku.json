    "postText": "Context about the song: It is about a girl who is sad and mad about her boyfriend who is waiting for her to breakup the relationship even though he is not making any effort anymore in the relationship. It\u2019s a very sad/ballad song\n\nThe singer is female soloist. \n\nI usually listen to this song on YT so I remember the YT photo or album cover to be red while the girl (singer) is looking up with eyes closed. I\u2019ve been searching for this song for hours on end. I used to listen to this everyday in 2019/2020.\n\nI hope someone in here knows this song! Please please! I friend of mine is in the similar situation and I want to share this song with her",

    "postText": "so i ordered merch on weverse usa shop and below where it says \u201corders in progress\u201d it says \u201cshipping and on-site pickup.\u201d does this mean i selected something that says i\u2019ll pick it up on site? when i click on my order it does have my shipping address on there, and i ordered through paypal. i ordered it early in the morning so i\u2019m just a bit paranoid i wasn\u2019t paying enough attention. i haven\u2019t ordered anything off weverse for a year so is this normal?\n\nedit: i contacted weverse to make sure and they said:\n\n\u201cRegarding your inquiry about \"shipping and on-site pickup\" under orders in progress, we would like to inform you that \"shipping and on-site pickup\" is just a filter for the order history. You can choose to see shipping and on-site pickup order history if you click it. \n\nIf you check your order details, you will see the shipping address for the order delivery, which means the order will be delivered to the address provided when placing the order.\u201d\n\njust in case anyone is ever confused like i was and sees this post, it\u2019ll be sent to the address given no problem!",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t help with why it says on-site pick up but I would encourage you to call the USA shop and ask. Maybe I can help with the time frame because I\u2019ve ordered a several things off of Weverse, mostly Season\u2019s Greetings or Membership Kits. And every single time it took more than 6 months to ship out. I\u2019ve noticed in the fine print where it says they only ship certain items quarterly. So you have to wait for the quarter (year) to end and then wait for international shipping. Took 10 months to get my TxT membership kit. It\u2019s always felt like getting a surprise gift in the mail because I\u2019ve usually forgotten all about my order by the time it arrives.",

    "postText": "Hi Kpop fans!\nMy mom entered a senior singing competition hosted by her health insurance group and she needs likes on her YouTube video to win! She is currently at 2nd place and she needs a little over 100 more votes to secure the 1st place spot. \nThis contest was designed for Korean seniors to find hope through song and performance during this pandemic. Will you please help her out by liking the video? Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CmFTLDkx6v8\n\n\nUPDATE (9/2/2020): MY MOM WON!! Thank you so much again, Reddit fam. Your boost at the end really propelled her to the top!! There\u2019s also going to be an encore performance of hers so stay tuned for that. I\u2019ll post it on this subreddit when it\u2019s ready. Thanks again!!",

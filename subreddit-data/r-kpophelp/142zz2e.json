    "postText": "So, if you don't know, (G)I-DLE's song ['Queencard' is currently at number one on all domestic charts except for Vibe](https://twitter.com/instiz_ichart/status/1666257010357313536?s=20), which is preventing the song from achieving a Perfect All-Kill (PAK). 'Queencard' has maintained the second position on Vibe for 10 consecutive days. The issue is that the chart system doesn't reveal any specific numbers. Some people have mentioned that it not only counts unique listeners but also takes into account the Karaoke Chart. However, the problem is that the [Karaoke Chart stopped updating a day after 'Queencard' was released.](https://vibe.naver.com/chart/karaoke)\n\nGetting a PAK is crucial for the group because it generates media coverage and attracts interest from various brands that want to collaborate with them. Unfortunately, even if (G)I-DLE fans were to mass email the company, i don\u2019t think they will  respond.\n\nDo you think the problem is not enough unique listeners in 24hours or not updating that karaoke since 16/may?",

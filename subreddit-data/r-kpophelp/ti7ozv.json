    "postText": "Here\u2019s the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/th2o1k/help_i_applied_for_an_in_person_audition_for_fun/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nSo here it is\u2026.audition day. I fucking did it. \n\nBasic rundown: \n\nJust yesterday I received an email telling me I\u2019m confirmed for the audition and the location of said audition. The audition was today. Yep, I received the confirmation email one day before the actual audition. Also, I applied to audition a day after sign-ups closed but they still allowed me to come (probably because they allowed walk-ins as a commenter on the last post said). Some people on my last post were congratulating me on getting confirmed to this audition but I think they invite everyone who signs up. Not to mention again, they took walk-ins, so the fact that I got confirmed isn\u2019t a big deal. Also, I later found out that they allowed someone who was out of the age bracket to audition (I don't think they were a lot older, maybe like 1-2 years older than 2003). \n\nAudition: \n\nSince this is my first in-person audition, I didn't really know what to expect. I have read other people's stories about their experiences so I kind of assumed it would be similar to theirs (I guess it kind of was???). There was also a dance convention happening at the same time and I think there\u2019s a possibility the company scheduled it at the same time so they can scout there. \n\nAnyway, I went to the audition location and walked into this room. There was this table with two dudes sitting at it. I approached the table and one of them asked for my name. I told him my name and he asked if I was there as a vocalist. I said I was and he handed me my number. Then I sat down in the designated area for vocalists. There was a girl already sitting there and I asked her if she was shitting herself. She said yes and we began a conversation about our vocal experience, what groups we like, our previous auditions, etc. Surprisingly there weren't that many people there to audition. I thought it would be super packed, but there were only about 20 people there, most of which were vocalists (both rap and singing). Another girl came over and joined us and we began our friendly talk. Another girl sat with us (a total of 4 people, including myself) and we all talked amongst ourselves. All three girls I was with seemed very nervous but for some reason, I wasn't. I think I wasn't as nervous because I'm not really expecting anything to come of it. The first girl I started talking to wanted to exchange Instagrams. Then she wanted us to make a group chat. So now I have an Instagram group chat with three random girls I met at the audition. I asked one of the girls if the audition would be one-on-one with no one else in the room and she thought it was. \n\nAbout 15ish minutes after I arrived, a lady walked out into the room with all the people who are going to audition. The audition was not one-on-one, she said that it was five at a time. Since there were four of us, we all decided to audition together with this other girl. We walked into a room and the lady started giving us the rundown of what to do. She said that we say our name, age, race, and what we're going to sing. Some of us gave our phones to this lady because we didn't want to hold them during the audition. We walked into an adjacent room one by one and I was third in line out of five. We were lined up against a wall. There were about 20 feet between us at the wall and the judges' table. There were about five judges there plus a lady with a mic and a guy filming. If I remember correctly, I think there was some random guy in the corner with a laptop but I'm not completely sure. Underneath the mic, there was a white \"X\" made with tape about 5ish feet in front of the judges. The judges greeted us and said some things that I don't even remember because I was getting a bit nervous at this point. On the table, there were papers taped to it hanging off that said, \"NAME, AGE, RACE\" on it to remind us what to say. I was third in the lineup so I thought I would go third out of them and I didn't want to wait and watch the other girls go because I feel like that would've made me more nervous. However, one of the judges gave us a choice for which order we went in. When she exclaimed that, I immediately decided to go first since I wanted to get it over with. I introduced myself, said my name, age, race, and the song I was going to sing. Then I sang it for them (I only decided to sing the chorus). When I was singing, I stared directly at the wall behind the judges because I knew that if I looked directly at them, it would make me so fucking nervous. However, there were times when I would glance very quickly at the judges. I didn't look at the camera either. When I glanced at the judges, there was this one judge who was nodding his head along to my singing and I think he was kind of smiling despite his mouth being closed (I really fucking hope I'm right because that's so fucking cool if he was). I didn't make eye contact with the judges and I really hope that doesn't hinder my chances. Although I did walk up immediately after one of the judges asked who was going to go first, so I hope that helps me.  \n\nAfter I was done, they thanked me and I thanked them. I walked back to the wall and the other four girls went after me. There was this one girl in my lineup who looked very young (maybe about 13) and she sang for the judges and the poor thing was literally trembling. \n\nWhen I was talking to the other girls, I asked them if our race would possibly play a role in the audition. Although they always say, \"global audition\", we all know that most companies favor Asians more (I'm East Asian, one girl was white, another was Latina, and the other one was Southeast Asian). I was also conversing with them if there was a chance this company would send out videos to other companies for them to see. \n\nHonestly, I think that after the audition is worse than before because now I'm overanalyzing and overthinking my audition. Like, \"is not making eye contact going to hurt me? is walking up *right* after they asked who's going to go first going to help me? is being East Asian going to help me? did my inexperience with singing show? none of the judges tried talking to me after the audition, does that mean they didn\u2019t want me?\u201d. Believe me, I think this is worse. At this point, I\u2019m just happy I didn\u2019t mess up terribly or embarrass myself. I\u2019m also just glad I got the experience of going to an in-person audition. \n\nIf anyone on the scouting/audition teams sees this, I hope to god this doesn't jeopardize my chances of passing the audition.",

If this all works out and you end up moving there to train, you\u2019ll come to expect this, lol. Last-minute announcements are the norm! Keeps you on your toes. Sometimes you\u2019ll get the details the morning of!\n\nI\u2019m also\u2026 not sure how it works with Kpop companies, but from a theatrical standpoint, at least, you did the right thing looking past the judges instead of at them. They\u2019re there to watch you, not to connect with you on a personal level, and it\u2019s a lot easier on both you and the judges if they don\u2019t have to break eye contact to write something down, which makes them uncomfortable and probably makes you feel like you messed up. \n\nThis is a super, super cool experience for you, though, and even if it doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s great that you went out of your comfort zone for it.

Companies want to see how'd you look in the camera and see if you're camera shy or not so looking into the camera would up your chances.\n\nIs walking up after they asked who wants to go first a good thing?\n\n\\- Yes. This shows that you have confidence and are passionate.\n\nNone of the judges talked to you afterwards.\n\n\\- No this is nothing to worry about. Almost 99.9% of auditions are like that unless they have some time between groups and if they don't contact you within the 1 to 2 month period after the audition, most likely means you didn't make it.\n\nIs being East Asian going to help?\n\n\\- Most likely so. Unfortunately for other races, most companies aim for people who look more Asian.\n\nDid your inexperience in singing show?\n\n\\- I'm not sure since I didn't see but from the reactions you saw, most likely it was okay. You don't have to be perfect since they'll train you but if they saw the potential, that is another point added to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, no need to worry to much! Seems like your audition went pretty well on the positive side! Hope you do well and good luck! Don't be afraid to attend another audition!",

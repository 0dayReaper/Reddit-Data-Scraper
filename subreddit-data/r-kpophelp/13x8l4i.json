No particular favorites.\n\nAlthough, Form of Therapy's reactions are super insightful. He fanboys but doesn't go overboard with it. He knows and talks about older acts. His reaction to Mamadol is one of my favorites!",

I personally watch a lot of their videos regardless of the group/artist because i genuinely enjoy their reviews and what they have to say.   \n\n**The Safe Cave** is the cutest most wholesome person on earth and i like watching their reactions as well! they\u2019re just enjoying music and videos but they also tend to pay attention to small details/sounds/stories so watching them doesn\u2019t feel like im just watching someone reacting with an empty head just for views.    \n\n**FiFiZappaReacts** is amazinggg when it comes to sounds, she pays so much attention to the music, vocals, tones, and gives feedback as so. Sometimes she'd listen to the instruments and starts humming how the part should continues and it continues exactly the same way she did lol. it\u2019s honestly impressive.   \n\nI personally avoid channels that just do a reaction for views without gaf about anything happening in the song/mv/album, they kinda piss me off tbh lol.",

It feels in some ways the purpose is for them to talk as autharities on the subject. I personally value the opinion of a producer or someone that makes music a lot more. For the most part if you have a good ear for music and understand how music is influenced from different parts of the music industry its interesting to hear peoples opinion. Also its just fun to hear people be excited about things that you like.",

I come from being a fan of very small indie-rock bands and I had thought of Nugu as something similar, so used it in the same way kind of meaning underrated or undiscovered. Like \u201cI am a big fan of these Nugu groups I keep finding\u201d. It seems like that here.\n\nBut then also I read it has a very negative flavor meaning failure or incompetent, so I am reluctant to say it at all.",

All groups that start under small companies are nugu in that they lack immediate recognition and success that groups under bigger companies have since the beginning. It's already been agreed upon that groups under big 4 labels have advantage over others because of higher budget, company stans and connections that the companies have in the industry.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m interested in hosting a GO for the new Ateez comeback, but I\u2019ve seen conflicting information about whether or not I will get all 8 member POBs if I order 8 albums. Does anyone know if Yes24 typically sends POB sets if you order enough albums (ie 8 albums for 8 members) or if they\u2019re totally random no matter what?\n\nFollow up question: if they do send ot8 POB sets, will I have to order 8 of the same album version?\n\nTIA for your insight!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve personally never seen it. And if so why don\u2019t they? Is it a safety issue or they just can\u2019t be bothered to do it anymore? I know they still do fan signs and fan meetings in Korea. A group I know is really getting popular and they\u2019re doing Polaroids on their next tour, so I was kind of bummed thinking that it will probably be the last time they will. They also didn\u2019t do it on the leg of the tour I went to so I really missed out. I got a group photo at least :,)",

            "comment": "My bias always had a group photo time towards the end of her concert. Polaroids are usually reserved for special occasions like album preorders or as surprise presents hidden under a few seats. It's definitely an event, but not a mandatory thing. TBH you'll expect more \"giveaway\" style items at fanmeets, where the goal is to interact more with the audience and give the fans something \"special\", rather than concerts where the focus is slightly more on performing.",

I know over all it\u2019s more popular in Korea than here. So I guess it\u2019s even less of a chance for me \ud83e\udd72",

It doesn't feel like a K-pop song translated into Japanese. iykyk\n\nThough after that, iZone Japanese releases went downhill but that's another topic lol",

Which means if someone who is not an idol releases a Korean pop song, that doesn't make them an idol, right? Which means you can release Korean pop without it being Kpop. There is absolutely ways to define Kpop, I never said otherwise, but the definition is more complex than \"oh yeah every Korean pop song is Kpop\" because that's not true. I feel like you're arguing just for the sake of it and you aren't actually listening to anything I'm saying.",

When WayV is C/M-pop. They also seem to consider Japanese releases as K-pop which is also wrong. A song like NCT 127's Chain is a J-pop song and has been shown to not work as well when sung in Korean. Why? Because it wasn't designed to be a K-pop song. It was designed to be a J-pop song. That's also why a lot of K-pop songs that get Japanese versions tend to sound way better in Korean than Japanese.",

Honestly I don\u2019t know what they would be categorized as when they do, but they are trained under a K-pop system, and are under a K-pop label (MLD) and will be promoting in Korea, but neither of their pre-debut singles are in Korean. \n\nI\u2019d still consider Blackswan Kpop, Rania was clearly K-pop even though they came out with English versions of some singles back then. And they promote in Korea.",

Just another case of i-fans overtaking discussions not made for them. Some of you say that it is \u201cencroaching on East Asian spaces\u201d but be honest, you just want a safe space to gawk at a different culture then yours. Kpop globalization is something that has been pushed for many years (you can thank BTS for a large part of that). It will continue to be pushed and you will only see more diverse idols in the future. Literally no domestic fan is worried about kpop being overtaken by foreigners but of course the I-fans want to come out of nowhere and gatekeep. Support who you want to support (obviously it\u2019s your choice), but you will never be able to prohibit a culture, race, or ethnicity from being a kpop artist if they sing, promote, and are under a Korean agency. Cry harder. (This isn\u2019t meant for OP btw, just some people who were claiming otherwise in this comment section).",

Hence, I liked that I can see myself represented in K-pop and it\u2019s more relatable for me. I can identify myself with many things within K-pop and the culture in general.

You don\u2019t really get a say in who gets to make K-pop when the music came from black people, just like everything else. If you want Asian centric music, you can listen to jpop. I highly doubt jpop would allow foreigners to even have an attempt at success, so that\u2019s another option. There\u2019s also very talented Chinese artists, based in China. But K-pop is not solely Asian, it\u2019s not traditional music by any means.

How many Asian artist can you list that are on the same level of fame and success in the West? Whose names are household names and known worldwide? \n\nK-pop should just be left for what it is. There is literally no need for Black representation in K-pop since black people ARE widely represented in the western music industry. There is no need for non East/South East Asians to insert themselves in this space.",

So it should relate to the country and its language at bare minimum, but that should also be pretty much the only requirements for a group to be considered K-pop in my opinion. If they have done all of that, then they're good.\n\nNot being able to accept foreigners into K-pop is a sign that K-pop is borderline stuck in the Park Chung-hee era and ultimately less diverse than J-pop. This is the pill that the hardcore ethnic-exclusivity K-poppers have to swallow. \"Weirding out its audience with foreign members\" does not equate to \"breaking K-pop law\". K-pop is AND should be much more than just formulaic idols going through rigid training and follow Korean customs all that bs. That is just modern idol culture, it does not and should not define the whole of K-pop.",

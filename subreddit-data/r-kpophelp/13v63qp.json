He also incorporated it into the choreo for [Fantastic](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu2yAQEgYLo&amp;pp=ygUMSGVucmkgdmlvbGlu), not the best show of virtuoso violin but a fun concept, and I don't keep up with him (and he's not really a kpop idol anymore) but by the looks of his YouTube channel he [still plays](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZTuG6Z6bLo&amp;pp=ygUMSGVucmkgdmlvbGlu)",

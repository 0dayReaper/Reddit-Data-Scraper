Choice is actually okay in terms of you will get your stuff in a timely manner and won\u2019t be over charged. They don\u2019t have the best customer service and have said some iffy things on their socials is all. \n\nReally any US-based kpop shop with a physical store is going to be okay, so just google kpop shop and keep trying till you find one. Saranghello in San Francisco and KPop Shop Reno both had items I was looking that were sold out everywhere recently for example.\n\nSecond edit - [this ebay seller is offering free shipping from Korea and has a decent rating](https://www.ebay.com/itm/166098003471)",

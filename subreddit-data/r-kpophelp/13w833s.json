    "postText": "Hey guys, I need help on picking songs for an assignment I have to do, which is putting together a playlist under the unit sociology. I got mixed feelings about it when I first heard about but whatever. Anyways I need to find either kpop songs or any songs in general that include 1 or more of these listed; power, privilege, institutional discrimination, implicit bias, stereotype threat, economic, racial, and gender inequality. I have some songs in mind but I'd like to hear other ppls recommendations to have more variety.",

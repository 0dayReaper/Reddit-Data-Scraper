            "comment": "The usps website can give you an estimate if you know how much your item weighs. Otherwise it takes 1-3 stamps usually for 2-4 pcs in my experience. In the beginning, it may be good to let those you're selling to know you're new and ask for advice. Most people are willing to help.\n\nEms and doms are shipping types, usually used in go's. If you are hosting a go, ems is the price it is for the place you buy from you ship to you and doms is shipping from you to your joiners.\n\nThis is based on my own experience only  and is my own opinion. Good luck. If you want to learn more, check out some YouTube videos from bigger sellers like Wonhaed or look at some established IG sellers and see how they're doing things. As you go, you'll figure out your own style.",

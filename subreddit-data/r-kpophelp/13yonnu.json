Maaaaybe a singer with a . in it or capital letters.\n\nI do rememeber her singing the word \"coffee\" in the chorus but it's not the title of the song. I've listened to it many times in the past but for some reason, I can't find it anymore.\n\nIt's a slower song but not super slow, it has some pace.\n\nIt's not \uc0ac\uac74\uc758 \uc9c0\ud3c9\uc120. It's slower than that.\n\nAnyone knows the title of this song?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsolved: [\uc724\ud558 (Younha) - \uc5c6\uc5b4 (Feat. \uc774\ub8e8\ud380\ud2b8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ns9rA0OSFM)\n\nI thought she said coffee but 10 years ago, I wasnt as good in korean as I am now (not good but better at least). The part where I thought she said coffee was \"\uadf8\ub9cc\ud574 \uacc4\uc18d\ud560 \ud544\uc694 \uc5c6\uc5b4\" but it was \"\uc18d\ud560 \ud544\" sang together which made me think she sang coffee lol.",

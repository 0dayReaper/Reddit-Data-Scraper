    "postText": "Greetings everyone, I'm the creator of a platform that allows you to showcase on your profile what you like by choosing from a wide range of themes and selecting multiple subjects within those themes that you love the most. (Website: [https://whatismystance.com/](https://whatismystance.com/))\n\nMultiple users have asked me to add the KPOP theme because they love it. However, I'm relatively new to the genre (only know BlackPink). So I would greatly appreciate guidance from you.\n\nI would like to add around 15 relevant artists/groups within the KPOP theme. If possible, they should be the most loved and well-known.\n\nIf you love KPOP, please comment with your most loved artists/groups, and I will aggregate all of them at the end to choose the most mentioned ones.\n\nThank you everyone :) !",

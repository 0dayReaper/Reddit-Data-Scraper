    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI used to love 2NE1 and f(x) when I was younger, but I disconnected from K-Pop ever since. I've recently gotten back into it, however I've only been into boy groups because I can't seem to find any new girl group that has that edgy alt vibe that 2NE1 and f(x) had. \n\nIt feels like every girl group nowadays is made to be hyperfeminine in either a sexy/cute way, and there's no room for the emotion/choreography and crazy style or rap to shine through. \n\nI've started getting into BLACKSWAN because Sriya and especially Fatou give me that bad bitch confident vibe, but except for Hwasa and these girls I can't think of anyone.\n\nHelp!\n\nEdit: I already know of Mamamoo, G-IDLE, Twice and Itzy, and obv Blackpink. I don't feel like any of these girl groups fit the vibe that I'm looking for.",

Their breakthrough was thanks to Up&amp;Down but my favourite title tracks are Ah Yeah and I Love You. My favourite albums of theirs is probably Street, maybe.\n\nKind of Everglow? I think First is one of the most powerful aesthetics/choreographies by a GG but it could be in a different way than what you want. I think Ladida is overall very popular in the kpop community.\n\nPlus I don't know if it fits what you are looking for but Sistar to me were pretty \"bad b*/tch\" as a vibe. Very fun and bright, but still bad b*/tches lol. I think Hyolyn still has that attitude, maybe one of the most evident (watch her Queendom perfomances maybe).",

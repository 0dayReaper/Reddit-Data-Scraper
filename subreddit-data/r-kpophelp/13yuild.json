    "postText": "So I feel like this post has kind of been a long time coming. K-pop has floated around me for a  number of years now, with the 1st song I remember hearing being Gee by Girls Generation &amp; it being a great time. But the first song to really latch onto me would come some years later and be Girls Front by Odd Eye Circle. \n\nRecently I've found myself wanting to immerse myself more in what it has to offer, one thing I've always appreciated about the genre is how willing and eager it is to experiment with new sounds. It is something I have been craving more as of late. I've made a small [playlist of songs](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4BzDFG4r5uSySGIDCPpxVN?si=424771291d6648c6) I've been listening to and like in hopes that some of you will be able to point me to similar/other things you think I'll appreciate.\n\nGranted this list may be a bit eclectic but I love a variety of different genres (especially house influences!) so feel free to throw in some oddballs, thanks for your help in advance! ;)",

Here are my initial reactions \n\n- Hell in Heaven: I quite like it,it\u2019s cute with a catchy chorus. *added to playlist*\n- Breath: Oooh now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!! The way the best lowers and pitch goes down when the \u201cI wanna breath set me free comes it\u201d\u2026 that was a reset. yup. *added to playlist*\n- Skinz: Had me at first but lost me along the way unfortunately, loved the pre-chorus but really not into the drop \n- Heartbroken Playboy: is giving early 2000\u2019s coming of age movie which I think was the goal and is really funny to experience \n- Xikey: no positive or negative emotions on either side of the scale\n- Rockstar: now this I am into! Love the speed and energy, it reminds me a lot of nightcore *added to playlist*\n- Freakin\u2019 Bad: Grew on me progressively the longer the song kept going ahaha \n- Poison Love: cute but not really for me. May need to listen again to have it grow on me \n- Goosebumps: now I really really like this a lot!! Love the different switch ups, especially towards the end. *added to playlist*",

Tortoise and the Hare plays around with different rhythms, and Third Eye has an interesting vibe. Eternally by Txt has a similar switching between songs that you find in I\u2019ve Got A Boy (Snsd). Goes from very peaceful, angelic vocals to very dark rap parts. Seventh Sense by NCT U is also very good - i\u2019ve never heard anything like it. I noticed that you have a song by youra on your playlist already, so I would recommend L by 015B and youra. \n\nHonorable mentions: Sukhimvit Swimming by ONF, and 19 by Stray Kids. Sorry I couldn\u2019t link any songs.",

            "comment": "I actually made a playlist like this as a person who listens to experimental music outside of kpop! Here's the [link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7d7l0W5C5axG6AjMbVUOMF?si=CBvMoMaXTIasy7K1DmiGrQ) I chose songs that are to me, experimental in their instrumentation, structure or genre in the realm of kpop. \n\nI do think that what's considered experimental in kpop is not the same as what's considered experimental outside of kpop. For example, Yves Tumor and Jean Dawson are two experimental artists I listen to, but if a kpop group released songs like theirs, most kpop stans would not consider it experimental. Of course \"experimental\" is just an umbrella term, any genre from pop, through edm, to rap or even rock can be experimental.",

    "postText": "I'll preface the question with two things. 1. I know idols says this as fan service but the last time they were in L.A they said they wanted to comeback to a bigger venue. 2. I have no idea how well tickets sold so maybe this question is answered with that. (Edit: I was at their last stop (Wiltern) and it seemed liked a full house so..)\n\nAs far as I'm aware, KARD are generally well liked by i-fans especially in U.S and Latin Am. So why do they stick to small venues or if it's a question of easier booking/cheaper rent cost, why not have two dates at certain stops? If I was talking about a small city, then maybe I'd understand but this is L.A.\n\nIf it's not a booking or not good sales, does DSP not think they can fill a larger venue? I'm not talking making the jump to something like BMO Stadium (22K seats) but we have bigger venues they could use. Someone educate me please. \n\nExcluding potential OC venues: \n \nDolby Theatre ~3.3K  \n\nHollywood Palladium ~4K  \n\nGreek Theatre ~5.9K. \n\nYoutube Theater ~6K. \n\nMicrosoft Theater ~7.1K\n\n~~I'm happy they're coming back and I'm definitely getting tickets but I guess I feel annoyance because it doesn't feel (to me because this is my opinion \ud83e\udd28) like they're getting the flowers they deserve. Whether that be a show win or bigger venues.~~\n\n\nTheir past and upcoming stop(s):   \n\n(2017) The Theater at Ace Hotel ~1.6K.\n\n(2019) La Mirade Theatre ~1.3K\n \n(2022) The Wiltern ~2.3K\n \n(2023) The Orpheum Theatre ~2K",

I bought it for DC last time and it filled up more by the time of the show but there was a lot of availability leading up to it so maybe it's hard to guage because they don't instantly sell out.\n\nFor their DC show they are in a venue that can offer larger capacity but they haven't opened up the top floor.",

Then I checked and apparently the Warner Theater has a 1,800 capacity and MGM National Harbor is 3,000 with all the levels open, so I guess that makes sense. \n\nI always liked the Warner Theater (I've seen a couple kpop groups there), but I'm just glad KARD is coming back to the area \ud83d\ude04",

Now I never went to a KARD concert myself, so it's possible the tickets are selling out and fans can't go who want to. However, in the data you provided, there was a slight increase in venue capacity.\n\n\nI agree, not sure why this year their capacity went down, maybe their touring numbers took a hit in COVID, and KARD just never recovered?",

This isn't KARD's first concert so they have data to analyze that suggests bigger venues would be a waste of money to book.\n\nAt my nearest venue they haven't even sold 30% of the tickets. There is demand but the effort ceiling is much harder when a fan has to buy a concert tickets, arrange travel, and show up early for merch over ordering an album(or leaving comments about the group on social media).\n\nA lot of people know of KARD but they don't like them enough to go through the effort of seeing them at a concert. It also looks like scalpers don't want buy up KARD tickets either.",

I just checked their 1st week sales is only 6k+ compared to last year's Re album 1st week which was 20k+. Maybe fans not vibing that much to the song?\n\nDSP is realistic about their fandom and dont want book a venue too big that not enough tickets being sold.\n\nAlso i remember a lot of kard shows were in a weekday monday to thursdays. So some shows have a lower audience turnout compared to shows you have on a friday/weekend date",

These days companies overestimate too much their groups and now we even see the mediaplay of doing stadium but by blocking lot of seat area. KARD was about to go on tour in Europe before Covid but im pretty sure that it wasn't sold out and they also loose money because they had to refund people and it was a nightmare between them / the concert label and the venues. (but apparently the problem seems more to be KARD company here sjsjsjsj)\n\nIn the end it's better to take smaller one. You taste the water and then you comeback with something bigger.",

    "postText": "So I've been in the kpop world since 2016 but was never really interested in collecting albums or pcs. I'd buy an album here or there but never more than one and have always just went with whatever pcs are included which wasn't bad by any means, I was happy with it. Again, had never been too interested in pc collecting. \n\nThat is... Until this recent Stray Kids comeback.\n\nSo far, I've bought 3 copies, including the limited version, of 5 Star. I plan to buy the last version I'm missing soon (kinda irrelevant to my actual question tbh). Anyway, there's a few 5 Star pcs I want, especially this one specific Bangchan card and I'm considering purchasing it from a seller. I just don't know about that type of thing very much. How can you tell a card is official? What's the price points for pcs like this? And what are some websites to use? Anything I need to be aware/cautious of? I tried looking on eBay but it just gave me anxiety...\n\nAlso, any ideas on displaying CDs? I have my albums on shelves but the CDs are so pretty, it feels kinda wasteful for them not to be seen. It's also sort of inconvenient to have to take albums off my shelves every time I wanna grab a CD inside.",

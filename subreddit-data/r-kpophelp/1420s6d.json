    "postText": "So I wanted to get the txt deco kit when it first released but couldn\u2019t due to money. Around the time of Christmas, I tried to get it again and it was out of stock. It\u2019s now my 2nd birthday after the release and it\u2019s not in stock again and honestly looks like it\u2019s not for sale. Will they ever restock it/is it discontinued\ud83d\ude2d",

    "postText": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm a pretty new fan, I've been following kpop for maybe a year or so.\n\nI was just wondering what the best way is to fully support an artist/group that I like. Usually, I tend to stream the music that I like on Spotify or on youtube and don't think much of it.\n\nBut I'd like to try to show my support a bit more, whatever that would mean. \n\nI still feel a bit disconnected, all I really know is streaming services like Spotify and Itunes/Apple Music. Most of the buzzwords and common terms that are thrown around  just make me feel more lost lol.",

            "comment": "It's the same way you would support a non-kpop artist. Buy an album or concert ticket if you can afford it. Streaming is a way of showing support as well.\n\nIf you want to focus more on one group you could buy multiple albums and sell any duplicate PCs you pull. Make up a little savings you can use to buy floor tickets when your fav tours.\n\nWith kpop there is a voting component for music show wins and random polls online. You can vote to increase the chances of a group winning on a music show.",

                            "comment": "Hypothetically the group gets slightly more money if you buy a phyiscal album or merchandise. Digital albums tend to be cheaper than physicals and a lower sell price means less money for the group. Storefronts such as Amazon, Itunes, etc also get a cut of the purchase.\n\nYou can also buy albums and merch on Weverse but the shipping is way higher than if you buy from a local retail store. If the items are Weverse exclusive then buying from there is worth it.\n\nA good way to keep up with music shows is to find the voting page for your group on twitter. They'll keep you updated.\n\nIdk the country your from but albums are sold at Walmart, Target, Fye, B&amp;N, and speciality kpop stores(like kpopusaonline).",

            "comment": "Honestly, you can support your artist the way you're able. Streaming is helpful and if you want to do more, maybe you can join your fandom's streaming projects on k-charts (Melon, Genie, Flo, etc.). If that's not possible then you can donate to them if you want to. \n\nFan bases also put out info on how to collect points on different voting apps so that you can vote during music shows. \n\nAlbum purchases are also great. You can probably get this information from your favourite groups' official accounts or by asking other fans. Attending concerts is also a great way to support an artist's revenue.\n\nYou can decide how to support in a way that's feasible for you. Supporting an artist shouldn't be a chore for you",

I see Weverse mentioned a lot as a physical seller.\n\nSorry for all the questions, I feel like a boomer haha",

There are two major charts: Hanteo and Circle (formerly gaon) which count amount of sales. Weverse is for HYBE groups. Other groups may have their own store. Usually k-pop albums are sold on Musicplant, YZY, Ktown4u, Withfans, etc. Or you can find people in your country organizing group orders and get the albums from them",

I don\u2019t know if I could call myself a STAY anymore?\n\nI think it started when Woojin left, it just felt different, as much as I tried not to mind it. I still supported them as 8, but it\u2019s hard to feel the same way again when you\u2019re so used to the number 9 and how they grew together as a group of 9 from the show. Also I stumbled upon a post of translation of what Hyunjin said on a vlive, basically meant that us fans shouldn\u2019t see them (or idols in general) as the whole world, as our only purpose in life but to find something else meaningful too (I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s the exact wording is and I couldn\u2019t find that post, but I\u2019m positive he did say something like that). So I did and I couldn\u2019t have been more grateful. I discover more stuff I enjoy and I develop a healthier relationship with Kpop, if that\u2019s a thing?",

Jennie seems happier with brand deals, Lisa looks the happiest dancing and Jisoo allegedly wanted to be an actress.

Their concept hasn't really matured either and now seems rather dated.\n\nTheir last comeback sounded like it could have been 2017. I feel like they do the bare minimum to keep the fans happy. I mean they debut the same year as NCT and WJSN and how many comebacks have they had.\n\nIt's a real shame because the girls are really talented but they are really wasted by YG.",

They got me into kpop in the first place and I was a big fan, but I can\u2019t keep up with a group that has no content or new music whatsoever. Eventually I got tired to listen to their 20 or so songs over and over and watching 24/365 so I moved on to groups that actually produce content on the regular and are interesting to keep up with. Now, I\u2019m not even excited about their comeback because I kind of stopped caring. I guess YG need to review their marketing strategy because they\u2019re losing fans and that\u2019s sad.",

SHINee was literally one the groups since I was a little kid listening to K-pop, even dreamed abt seeing all 5 of them on stage. When that happened, watching OT4 content is just not the same for me, heck I watch more OT5 videos :/ I still check their music out but that\u2019s abt it.\n\n\u2022 BTS: Similarly like others mentioned, not a fan of their recent releases; been a fan of them since Skool Luv Affair so music direction is different now. Happy for their successes tho!\n\n\u2022 SUJU: I actually have no idea why. Sure, these guys are pretty controversial here, not many people like them (understandably so), but I always manage to separate the art from the artist (i tend to have low expectation for my 2nd gen groups anyway); hmm I guess I just lost interest which is unfortunate because this group is also one of the groups I grew up with \ud83d\ude05\n\nI think the only ones I\u2019m somewhat been following is TVXQ/JYJ/solo content because its just easy to digest \ud83d\ude05 I don\u2019t feel obligated to watch it + their content is not churned out frequently.",

Their label will put out any crap these days because they know fans are so hungry for content they'll stream anything and act like it's amazing no matter how low effort it is.\n\nTheir energy also just seems to be gone. Especially jennie and Lisa, I feel like there's such a difference between them now and a few years ago. They look worn out and unenthusiastic all the time to me.

I only stan(ned) bts &amp; nct but because there really was no content, like concerts, album releases (especially for bts), no fansite photos/videos, I just lost interest. Stan Twitter kind of died and everything that was released was pre recorded. Before the pandemic, I used to be able to tell exactly when a photo or video was released based on the members' hair colors, clothes etc but lately, everything that has been released has just been a mess without a timeline. I don't really know how to explain, but I feel like there has been a detachment because of the pandemic. And also probably because I've stanned these groups for almost 5 years, I don't really know what else there is to watch or do. I've listened to all their songs and I rarely come across a video I haven't already seen. I feel like I don't have to actively keep myself updated to call myself a fan, I would just know if there would be something worth checking out.",

I feel like they are kind of selling out in order to win a grammy and its saddening, because BTS doing what they wanted and calling out the industry is what made them so appealing in the first place. Too, I think with the pandemic I gradually lost interest. At that time I felt like we were being oversaturated in too much content, and it was becoming too much to keep up with. Also, army twitter was incredibly toxic. I deleted my Stan account in 2019 or 2020 I can't remember, and since then I haven't been caught up on anything except new songs (which Be, besides Dis-ease and Telepathy, was disappointing). My hope is that eventually they go back to their roots and rediscover their passion for music, because I feel like that is what is missing from them these days.",

I know what she did was not something to be ignored but nobody deserves d threats and some of the comments I've seen on her ig) getting shitloads of hate even after apologising and death threats daily compared to skz actions sometimes being ignored and unconfronted.\n\nNow before i get shit in the comments, i want to say i never hate on groups. By this i mean that i dont go on their socials and tell them to disband. I keep this to myself and i am in no way telling any one to unstan stray kids. I just want people to know the history behind their favs. Do whatever makes you happy.",

Wishing him well, but hopefully he doesn't come back to the entertainment industry though, maybe in the shadows like as a lyricist/composer, but please not in the spotlight. It seems that balancing fame and fortune doesn't suit him. Still sometimes checks out Jaejoong and Junsu, rarely checks on Changmin and Yunho, heard Minnie got married.\n\nSNSD - had a break from kpop because of 2014, came back around 2016 to support Sica's album. Holiday, even though it was penned by maknae, was not my cup of tea. Mr.Mr. is the last SNSD album that I've listened to in its entirety. Loved Seohyun's solo debut, when she left SM, I just stanned her dramas instead. Still waiting for Sica's next album to drop, Seohyun's too, but they're focusing on other things now, so the wait might be long. Will occasionally watch the unnies content, Taengoo's funny in Amazing Saturday. But not as devoted as before, life is busier.",

To simplify things, MOAs were really awful to X1, even people I had really respected and who didn't engage in fanwars/clapbacks/etc. Even the translators didn't respect X1 and made it known. At one point I unfollowed almost everyone but the damage was done, especially after X1 disbanded a couple days later. I didn't feel happy seeing TXT's content anymore so I just took a step back, muted all their names, and took a break. I do listen to their music sometimes but I've never had a desire to return to stanning them. I'm much more settled now so it takes a lot for me to be interested in a group, and TXT doesn't stand out to me.",

I am still curious about their comeback though... It's a lot of contrasting feeling honestly. I'd say I just take the good and I let things be, if the comeback is good I will be happy to have more good music. \n- **Red Velvet** if we mean \"super fan\" level. I still like them. I think this new comeback will be pivotal to understand what exactly is my level of passion for them lol. I liked their 2015 releases a lot, then 2016 was a big no for b-sides (but iconic title tracks and concepts), then 2017 and 2018 were golden years for albums and everything tbh, then 2019 was very meh if we exclude the good title tracks and a couple of b-sides (but the idea of the trilogy and how it developed was overall cool)... And 2021 was forgettable in all ways and the worst alongside 2016 (edit: no I'm sorry, 2016 is better musically and with iconic title tracks but even if it wasn't, the concepts would still make a difference). They have had a weird path and I really want this 2022 to be a 2015/2017/2018 level because those years are what Red Velvet could be. \n- **Blackpink** for the reasons everyone say. Again, still a fan but not \"super fan\", similarly to Red Velvet (even if with different reasons).",

I just seen that Rose\u2019 is going to be featured in Tiffany &amp; Co. ad and I\u2019m happy for her but I honestly rolled my eyes at first and literally said \u201cbut still no music\u201d even though it\u2019s rumored they were supposed to be having a comeback around this time.\n\nIKon - mainly because B.I left. Which I know is the clich\u00e9 thing but I was just getting into iKon. I had started watching iKon TV and everything then he left and I almost immediately forgot their existence. Even on Kingdom, I was the least excited for their performances.\n\nRed Velvet - I think I never truly clicked with RV. I always liked them and heavily supported them but I just couldn\u2019t get into them as a group. Everytime I\u2019d get interested, I\u2019d lose my interest just as quickly as it started. Also because SM is starting to treat them like their older groups, just giving them a comeback when they remember they exist. \n\nAteez - I honestly think I jumped into their hype too fast. When everyone was raving about their debut, I actively avoided them (which I do with anything that has a lot of hype, not for fear of disappointment but just because it\u2019s annoying to an extent) and then after it died a little I got into them and I freaking loved them (still do). But I wouldn\u2019t say I ever truly stanned them because all that debut hype quickly faded and so did my interest. But I do still support them. Just won\u2019t call myself an ATINY.\n\nTXT - I really liked TXT. I still like them honestly but I just can\u2019t deal with the fandom. And I know every fandom has its craziness but I just can\u2019t. However the fandom isn\u2019t the only reason. Like I said I avoid hyped things and TXT are very hyped and that kind of puts me off even though I stan a lot of popular groups. As you can see above, I\u2019m slowly drifting away from the more popular groups. I do still support TXT but I\u2019d label myself a casual listener.",

I was super into fever and the mini film but then lost interest. \n\nAnd Svt \u2014 I attended their online concert in early 2021 and tried to watch all the eps of their In The Soop but there are way too many members and I just could not keep up with their constant Weverse updates. (And the new music didn\u2019t pull me in.)\n\nBTS remains my ult but I definitely pulled back from actively stanning because of ARMY toxicity and the aggressively overpriced merch drops.",

            "comment": "blackpink\u2014 i was never a stan but i was still a big fan esp bc i felt like they helped make kpop go mainstream in the west and were genuinely just killing it (like coachella, etc) but they don\u2019t make enough music or do any kpop related activities for me to stay interested. and i felt like their music (aside from maybe ice cream) all sounded relatively the same and it didn\u2019t show any range. they\u2019re obviously rly talented but we never get to see it. obv if they don\u2019t want to be idols anymore that\u2019s ok! it\u2019s their lives and they should have freedom to do what they want. but if that\u2019s the case i think they should stop selling merch as a kpop group. maybe they could release individual merch? idk but i feel bad for blinks when yg releases endless amt of merch instead of music.. it almost feels like they\u2019re just in it for the money.\n\nalso (jennie in particular) it was hard for me to like them bc i felt like they became ig influencers and were just basic celebrities/rich ppl running in the same circles as other ppl i don\u2019t like, like the kardashians and grimes. i still like rose and jisoo a lot tho, just not as idols lol.",

I still have my biases and sometimes check in on them, but I don\u2019t follow their activities or releases anymore.\n\nBTS - became a fan in 2016 and have faded away the past 2 years. They\u2019re still great guys but the music shift has done it for me. It\u2019s great for groups to explore themselves and have their music evolve as they go on, but with the western releases, it doesn\u2019t feel 100% like them. Not to be like \u201cI miss the old days\u201d but I guess I sort of do.",

Which isn\u2019t a bad thing bc at the end of the day, they are a business as a whole and this is just a job they happen to enjoy\u2026but\u2026.their music after the two albums I mentioned was very much turning generic. \n\nBLACKPINK: for a group that\u2019s been around since 2016, it\u2019s sickening that they such a small track list\u2026.\n\nLOONA: after a long hiatus and the Jaden Jong calamity, I just lost interest. And even more so when they came out with PTT, I was gone. And it makes me sad bc they are the first ever group I bought a lightstick for. Plus let\u2019s not get into them being top 5 plus background dancers. Strong debut but a steep decline. \n\n\nMAMAMOO: When they stopped appearing on \u201cImmortal Songs\u201d, I was devastated\u2026but, after they hit their 7 year time limit and Wheein was the only who decided not to come back, I was sucked into a black hole. \n\nBUT totally unrelated, while we are on MAMAMOO, anyone remember their brother group, VROMANCE???? They dropped I\u2019m Fine &amp; She  and just disappeared\u2026???",

They\u2019re called HIGHLIGHT now. They used to be 6 members, then 5, now 4. It\u2019s hard to listen to their songs without feeling nostalgic. I miss them as 6 and I miss their old songs. I\u2019m still happy and rooting for them regardless.",

I was all in 2020 and with the onset off the pandemic and was able go keep up with all of their content and even bought the ARMY membership.\n\nHowever, in early 2021 I just started to lose interest in watching their content. My work life became very busy and stressful and I had less free time to spend on catching up on their content. Then there was their last single that they released that just made me question where the musical direction of the group was going. \n\nI'm waiting for their next release to decide whether I want to continue on as a stan or just as a casual listener.",

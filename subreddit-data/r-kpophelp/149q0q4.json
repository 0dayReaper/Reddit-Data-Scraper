I mean no disrespect to any fans, I\u2019m asking out of pure curiosity!\n\nHow are groups like le sserafim formed where they have Sakura who has been in the industry for over a decade and Eunchae who was only training for 6 months before debuting? Also how does it work with people like Miyeon who was apparently close to debuting with blackpink, do they continue training or what happens? \n\nAlso when it comes to members who had to leave a group like Soojin from G(Idle), I\u2019m curious how there seems to be no further news about her considering she seemed pretty well known before? I would\u2019ve thought that fans that still support her recognise her around Korea and would post updates etc? \n\nI\u2019m also curious if there\u2019s much media (interviews and such) of ex idols talking about maybe experiencing disillusionment upon entering the entertainment industry. From what I know the Korean entertainment industry seems to be unique in how they position their actors/celebrities/idols as performers with a major focus on fan service and perception. It\u2019s interesting that internationals like Le Sserafim\u2019s Yunjin would choose to join the industry knowing that it\u2019s not the global standard (to be expected to perform 24/7 with a perfect image). I\u2019d love to hear your opinions on this too - do the pros outweigh the cons for them?\n\nHas dating always been poorly received by fans - Hyeri and Sooyoung have been with their partners for years but I\u2019m not sure if they became public while still active as idols. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a culture question but does anyone else think Yena should get more mature concepts lol she was on Hyemileeyechaepa too and she seems so cool and really shines when doing hip hop choreo. I went to go watch some of her performances but \u2026 yeah. \n\nThey\u2019re all insanely talented but the secrecy of the industry is so fascinating to me.",

    "postText": "I've been a Kpop fan for years but with it being FESTA season yet again, I just kinda realized no other group I follow has anything like that as far as I'm aware. I stan around 10 groups, &amp; for the 9  besides BTS I've never seen or heard of anything similar from them. I've seen casual celebrations of Anniversaries for groups but nothing like the 2 week I guess \"virtual event\" they have.  \n\nIs this concept of FESTA unique to BTS?\n\nEdit: Is there something wrong with the question? Confused why I've been downvoted.",

I know a lot of groups do fan meetings and a yearly live event to celebrate their anniversary, but txt also do something called [dream week](https://txt.fandom.com/wiki/TXT_Dream_Week) which is similar to festa in that it\u2019s an extended period of new content prior to the actual anniversary. there are a lot of parallels to festa in that they drop dance practices, old videos and clip compilations :)",

Txt also does dream week and I think stray kids does like a stay week \n\nThe extravagance of Festa increased in scale probably due to BTS overall insane popularity. They are able to do a lot more free or nearly free type activities because they\u2019re able to get so many sponsors or earn it back easily.\n\nI think it\u2019s a great celebration though that actually increases overall fan buy-in so it might come as a as a financial loss in the short-term, but adds to more long-term investment\n\nNote: the current scale of some Festa events have gotten bigger overtime, but a extended celebration including photos, practices songs was always there",

Bangbangcon is the new recent thing after the got big not the FESTA itself.\n\n\nEdit: For anyone wondering when did FESTA start, it started from the beginning from their first year anniversary in 2014.",

You think random people aren't going there just to see what the fuss is about whenever there is a headline about BTS members and its just a lot of spamming and an echo chamber. At that point, BTS becomes like a traffic sign you keep passing by to get to something more interesting. People don't care anymore and tune them out. BTS fans don't realize that just because they're at the top, it doesn't mean they're the most loved. Views and streams is not just fans watching what BTS does. It's also random people who are curious and those who just want to see weaknesses in the members. I'm sure by now BTS members are more than ready to get off this pedestal and do something different. There is such a thing called too much of a good thing can be just as bad as failing and it's lonely at the top.",

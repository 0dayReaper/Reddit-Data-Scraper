    "postText": "Help with Kihno/ Air Kit?\n\nSo I got an Air Kit/ Kihno of ReVe Festival Day 1 second hand at a music store. I'm really struggling with how this works? I downloaded the app and watched videos. I do not have a iPhone. I have a Google pixel. ReVe Festival Day 1 came out in 2019, so I'm curious if these type of Kihno Air kit things just stop working? It is the button type. There's no external power? I don't really understand how this works \ud83d\ude14 LOL like I know you're supposed to push the button on the microphone but nothing happens? I guess I just want to know if these things die after some time because it is from 2019",

About the battery, I think all the models have an internal battery, like the ones on watches, so you'll probably have to find a way to open it and change it, if it's depleted",

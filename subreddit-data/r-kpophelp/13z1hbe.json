    "postText": "I recently adopted a cat and she\u2019s between 1-2 and seems to be obsessed with my kpop albums.  I think her bias is Jungkook or Youngi \ud83d\ude02\n\n I had left BTS Jungkook photobook on bed from when I was cleaning/reorganizing earlier and she lied on it and purred for 15 minutes. She then found my Youngi album and, when I wasn\u2019t looking, jumped up and began stepping up and down on it with her paws, now it\u2019s dented in two places. My cat then went and sniffed every kpop thing I own and tapped on them with her paws. I have to check if she scratched any. She tried to  sit on a few of them. \n\nHow do you protect them from cats jumping on, biting, or scratching them? How often do you have to replace them?",

Put them on a shelf or in a storage box when you aren\u2019t looking at them. I have one dvd package with a small scratch on the front of the box (I left it on the table while I was watching it lol) but I haven\u2019t had to replace anything.",

It might get a little expensive if they are multis but a happy cat is a cat that doesn't eat your kpop collection. \n\n\ud83d\ude09",

            "comment": "Have had cats my whole life lol. Seconding what others have said about not leaving them out unattended. If the cat is messing with them while they\u2019re on a shelf, try putting them on a higher up shelf. Or get some kind of display cabinet with a see through front that closes over the shelves, so the cat can\u2019t get into the shelves. You could try getting them something else that is a similar size and shape or similar material, that\u2019s just for them. But this might also encourage them to mess with anything that feels like that, and make them want to mess with your albums more. Maybe get something else to engage them. Stock up on some simple and cheap cat toys, maybe some catnip to put on the toys, and see what things the cat likes most, and then you can invest in more of that type of toy. Or just try some ribbon or string lol. Our cats always love ribbon. Maybe she just likes boxes? I had cats once that were obsessed with our pile of boxes for recycle we were too lazy to take out more often when I lived with college roommates lol. Like the cats would literally chew on the cardboard, they were goofy. If you have any empty boxes around you could see if she\u2019d play with that instead. Things to play with or other boxes might keep them distracted. Cats will often even play by themselves if you leave cat toys around on the floor, or you could try one of those round things with a ball inside the cat hits to spin it around lol, though I\u2019ve found this a hit or miss\u2026some cats love it, some ignore it completely. \n\nShe\u2019s probably just sniffing your stuff to get used to her new place. If you have something near you or that she associates with you or your smell or something then she might knead on it with her paws. Especially if it\u2019s on your bed lol, she probably just wanted to do that to the bedding because it\u2019s soft, but happened to be standing on the photobook instead of on bedding at the time. One of our cats will do this no matter what his paws are on, if he wants attention or to cuddle, so that\u2019s usually when he\u2019s somewhere soft like on the bed, or on the sofa.",

            "comment": "When my cats were younger, one of them used to bite into the albums on the bottom shelf \ud83d\ude48 i have some albums with teeth marks now. Thankfully, I disciplined him out of that and now he leaves them alone. My other cat never did any such thing. But the biter is obsessed with biting cardboard boxes and well kpop albums are cardboard so..he was really into that. But keeping the albums in a relatively secure place, making sure your cats have enough other stimuli and toys, and scolding them and grabbing them by the neck like a momma cat when they do touch kpop albums helps.",

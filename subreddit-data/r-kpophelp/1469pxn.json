    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m kinda new to K-pop and I was considering going to a convention this fall so I can get to know different groups and see them live.  Where should I go?  (I\u2019m in the USA, East coast, but could possibly travel to Canada or Western Europe). I\u2019ve found some things online, but I have no idea what\u2019s good and what will be a fun experience.  My current favorite groups are mostly smaller, although there are some of the big groups I like.  Mostly I\u2019m just learning the landscape.  Do any of the larger conventions have smaller groups that might not make it on the artist list / teaser info?  How early do you have to buy tickets and get a hotel?  Thanks!",

            "comment": "The biggest (and longest running) K-Pop convention is KCON, which started out in Los Angeles, branched out to NYC, but last year (its first post-pandemic installment) it just stayed in LA and mounted a small \u201ctour\u201d around the US with a few of the artists.  This year appears to be LA only again.  They just released a word search hinting at the lineup (which people have of course solved), but the formal lineup announcement and ticket sales will be in the next month or so, with the actual convention happening in mid-August in the LA Convention Center/Crypto.com Arena.\n\nKCON usually lasts three days\u2014Friday to Sunday, with Saturday and Sunday culminating in a concert in the arena with half of the lineup performing each night.  The convention itself includes an exhibit hall, panels, and \u201cfan engagements\u201d where fans who have bought the appropriate passes gather in one of the big halls to see one of the groups/acts show up, do a little Q&amp;A, play a game, and do \u201chi-touches\u201d with fans who have bought hi-touch passes (fans walk past tables with the artists on the other side for a very quick high-five, handshake and/or word with them).  Artists also tend to show up in the exhibit hall to participate in special events, such as interviews and so on.\n\nThe concert itself, which runs from about 7:30-10pm, is festival style, with artists performing from 1 to 5 songs depending on their seniority and reputation (and discography).  The concerts are also edited down to an episode of M Countdown to air in Korea a couple of weeks later, so most of the acts will be performing their latest/current song for the show.  KCON is a CJENM production, and they own Mnet as well as Wake One (formerly Stone Music), so it\u2019s likely to see current WakeOne/Mnet acts in the concert (ZeroBaseOne and Kep1er are basically locks for this KCON).  JYP and SM acts also turn up, but I don\u2019t recall YG acts participating.  HYBE is also bound to be represented.\n\nAny artist is bound to lure someone to the show, so I believe KCON always makes a point of announcing that they will appear, even if they\u2019re not \u201cofficially\u201d in the lineup and are just listed as \u201cspecial guests.\u201d\n\nFriday nights for the past few KCONs have been for \u201cKCON Rookies\u201d events, where acts who are rookies to the industry and/or new to KCON make an appearance and/or perform for an audience in one of the big halls.\n\nIn the past couple of years there have been attempts to mount competing American festivals, such as KAMP in LA in 2022 and WeBridge in Vegas earlier this year, but reactions have ranged from disappointing (many KAMP acts had to cancel due to visa issues, leading to low attendance) to just low-key (despite maybe one cancellation, WeBridge happened but didn\u2019t get a huge reaction).  I personally am hoping that someone finally creates some decent competition for KCON (for which prices have effectively gone higher and higher each year), but for now it looks like the more cost-effective and rewarding alternative is to just seek out individual concert tours, where one will at least get a full set of performances from a favorite artist, if not some VIP perks.",

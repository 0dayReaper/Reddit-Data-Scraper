(Not saying that they should've debuted as 3, just wondering why they didn't even though they were capable enough).",

So if YG who has always been Hip hop/Rap oriented never debuted a duo or a trio I don't think that Jyp who has always been more mainstream would have done that.\n\nAlso unfortunately even through I love their visual 3racha don't cater so Kbs so they would have probably been successful but not as much as they are now. They become really popular thanks to many factor but let's not discount the others member who brought many fans.",

JYPE probably always planned to have a full idol group debut after Got7. I think 3racha was happenstance and a serendipitous one at that but there was never any plan for them to debut as a trio. \n\nThough I definitely wonder if they're planning a 3racha debut sometime in the future",

Idol groups are such a uniquely powerful force at the moment for a number of reasons: there\u2019s members with different strengths and personalities to appeal to different people (including the aforementioned pretty/performance-focused archetype, which probably has the broadest appeal); more people means they can put on big, impressive, energetic performances because no 1 person is responsible for too much of the vocals; the team dynamics and entertainingness of all the non-music media kpop puts out will be heightened with more members; etc.\n\nSo in short, nothing stopped them from debuting at 3, it was just never the plan because both them and the company were focused on forming a more normal-sized, balanced idol group for all the benefits that brings.",

This isn't to say the others don't have their own popularity, it's just that these members are the ones getting people interested or getting the group name out there.",

They need main dancers, a visual or two, and a solid vocal line that serve different parts of a song. 3racha are all good singers and dancers but their specialty is rap and production.\n\nETA: Just to be clear, I'm talking about from JYPE's point of view. They debut idols. 3racha would not have been an idol group just the three of them. If they had been debuted as an idol trio, they would be spending less time on their specialties and more time trying to be main vocals and main dancers. Only with an actual dance line and vocal line, 3racha could continue to grow at the rate they have as idols.",

You have some trainee projects that are (like Trainee A for example), but they just didn't. I think that if they debuted them as 3 they would have flown under the radar a bit.\n\nIt was through Stray Kids (the show) that they started to build up popularity, and then when they debuted as Stray Kids they had a fanbase behind them. This fanbase gave them a place to show off their work to far more people then they may have if they just debuted as 3.",

And we can see how their faces light up when the eliminated members, Felix and Lee Know, were brought back. Plus how Changbin glares at JYP when he wants to exclude Chan from 3RACHA and ends up performing as 3RACHA despite his wishes lmao. yeah they've got a strong bond so tbh so it's hard to imagine them debuting apart. that's my take on it",

Felix and Hyunjin bring in a lot of fans from their visuals and bias-baiting qualities, and the other members also bring in stronger sung vocals and better dancing than 3racha could manage alone. Every member is very talented so putting more diverse talents in one place only helps the entire group to be better.",

There's the one with the silver railings and the big white pillar with U-shaped upper landing, and then there's the ones with the red railings and the angled kind of triangular upper landing.  Where are these stairs located?  I have a collection of photos of my favorite groups on the stairs and would love some context for them.",

(The door he takes at 1:09 is a cut, and likely does not lead to the back of the stage where he appears next).",

It\u2019s not like most English K-Pop songs which are either direct translations of more evocative Korean expressions or, worse, just a jumble of English words thrown against a wall because \u201cit sounds cool.\u201d\n\nAnother example I would mention are EsNa\u2019s English songs like [\u201cMe, Today,\u201d](https://youtu.be/oe1H_OG5MsM) but I guess that would be somewhat unfair because EsNa is a native English speaker (born and raised in LA) and would have a native English writer\u2019s approach to songwriting in addition to her existing skills.",

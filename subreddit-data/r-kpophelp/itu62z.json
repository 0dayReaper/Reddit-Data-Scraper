I'm out of the loop on the Woojin scandal but whether or not he is a sex offender is not based on 3 second clips, so why are they doing that? They're making themselves look ridiculous in my opinion, trying to play justice court and only bringing up unrelated petty reasons. That's not what determines if he's guilty or not. Can't they just wait for investigations to progress and bring factual proof, then talk about that? No, no they can't, they know better than everyone else how justice works and they have to treat the topic of sexual assault like some pointless drama for views, I get it...",

I dont watch that stuff because most of it is so stupid, im sure some of it actually makes sense but damn. I have no idea if hes guilty or not and neither does anyone else, everyone just needs to take a step back and realize that they are now part of the toxic kpop community that they all talk shit about. you dont know anything and your nitpicking and trying to sway others opinions. Yes there is a lot of fishy stuff with how he reacted and stuff, but ive seen a few \u201ci hope he dies\u201d and similar and holy fuck, your condemning a man to death for a something that you\u2019re hearing second hand a million miles away. These people are sick and are biased because they have already labeled him as guilty, thats freaking dangerous.",

They want to make him seem as evil as possible when that\u2019s just not true. \n\nThat\u2019s the scary thing about sexual assault, the people that do it can be likable, talented, friendly, good looking, etc. It\u2019s not as black and white as they want it to be. Anyone is capable of being a predator regardless of how people perceive them.",

It\u2019s their way of understanding the world as good guy vs bad guy since people are complicated and it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow that a sexual predator could also have kind moments.\n\nAs you touched on, this is why most sexual assaults do not happen in back alleys by masked evil ugly monsters but by people who were originally likable enough to get close enough to do it!  I wish people could understand that more too.",

Like Woojin rubbing his leg, if it was a video clip of themselves they'd say \"well I just had an itchy leg, it's not that deep\" But when acting as the observer, they are much more harsh in their judgments, and often reduce others' motives to their preconceived notions of who they are, in this case assuming \"Woojin rubbed his leg because he was horny\" instead of giving him any benefit of the doubt to truly consider WHY instead of jumping right to the desired end result of \"Woojin is a predator\"\n\n[Defensive attribution hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_attribution_hypothesis) \\- basically people want to believe they can identify what goes wrong in a situation so they can feel in control of a future situation. In this example, people want to be able to identify every action of Woojin's as evil so they can convince themselves they will recognize these evil actions in the future and be able to protect themselves. To accept the reality of \"anyone could look nice and act nice and then surprise, be an abuser\" is chaos for the emotions, the lack of predictability leaves people feeling vulnerable to being victim of the same situation. So whenever these abuser allegations come out, or bullying allegations like with AOA Jimin, people want to hone in on every behaviour and label and pretend that darker, sinister thoughts can be identified constantly and easily by these subtle gestures. It's a sort of herd protection mentality where everyone pretends they can logically understand where evil came from so they can prevent it again, but really deep down they can't.\n\nI don't say any of this to defend Woojin or discredit the allegations against him, but there are understandable reasons why the mob after him acts the way they do.",

Some person gets accused of anything, and suddenly there's 20 youtubers with videos coming out about \"PROOF SO AND SO IS AN ABUSER!!!!!111\" with their ignorant opinions over some blurry clips and them diagnosing strangers as sociopaths and sex addicts using wikipedia articles. \n\nI want actual information not the opinions of some 19 year old on youtube who thinks they're an actual investigator because they can view publicly available information and extrapolate crazy assumptions. \n\nThis isn't even just a kpop problem, it's a whole youtube problem. In the end, it means any truth will be buried under a million rumors and wannabe investigators, just a bunch of self-important dorks on youtube who slather on their makeup or do their hair up real nice so they can sit down and make some dumb video running their mouths about how someone they don't know is \"definitely\" an abuser/user/whatever else. In some cases it's damn near bullying, in other cases it's just incredibly cringy and pathetic that these people online think they can actually investigate other people in an unbiased way based on social media outrage and tiny video clips.",

These haters were making a shitstorm out of nothing at all. This time, Woojin is accused of a crime, so there's a whole legal aspect to it, and even potential jail time. And those accusations are based on a victim's statement, which could be true. So in Chan's case there was no need to wait for proof because there was no problem in the first place, whereas in Woojin's case there could be proof for or against him.",

They're just coming up with all sorts of shit as \"evidence\" That they were always the \"bad guy\" Even if it was a mistake or not. In my opinion, once he's knocked down the fans would just step all over him to make him feel even WORSE for everything EXCEPT for the purpose of what he did.

            "comment": "It makes no sense how they automatically believe a female they have never seen nor associated with prior to this happening. And how a person on the internet is all it took for them to believe her and not Woojin is not okay. Not only did she have no evidence and was specific about nothing but then everyone that believes her is only making the situation worse by trying to say Woojin is acting suspicious about the situation. He was deflecting it and giving her a chance to stop the lies and walk out scott free but now this shit has spiraled out of control and he is being rapidly accused of other shit by random netizens because they want to make the 1st persons story seem more plausible when in fact, Woojin literally would've had no time for any of the shit he is being accused of. 10X is a legitimate company that has just established themselves and someone had even gone as far as making a fake 10X account to deny that Woojin was an artist there. It is way more likely that he didn't do it than it is likely that he did and people refuse to see that because they are stuck in this cancel culture, feminist, \"the victim is always right\" bullshit agenda and mindset. And they are refusing to look at the simple facts that not only would he not have the time to do it, but also that he is trying to be a soloist in a new company and being a kpop idol is not just for the entertainment of fans, that shit is a whole occupation and a source of income, he would not put that in jeopardy, especially when he is associating himself with a company that is trying to establish itself. And all these videos overanalyzing every flick of the wrist he has made while in stray kids because he has been accused of something when they saw those moments as him just being himself while he was in skz are ridiculous and out of pocket. It's crazy how people can switch up so quick when there is no proof from the victim that what she said happened actually happened. And especially as an anonymous person, her word is NOT bond. Being a Kpop Idol is a whole source of income and they are fucking with this mans money right now just because they wanna believe some random tweet. Especially with the fact that he has just left a pretty popular group for what seems like no reason to people, it is 20 times more likely that this is just a complex sasaeng attack. Also I'm not trying to say that there is no chance the the accusations are true because literally everything is a possibility. I am just pointing out the most possible and plausible possibility from what we have so far about the situation.",

His company has been proven to be real on multiple occasions. 10X is not a trademarked company/business name like McDonald's or Wendy's. No one can name their company McDonald's even if that is their last name because that is a trademarked business name of chain restaurants all around the world. But since 10X is not trademarked, literally anyone could name any company about anything 10X if they wanted to.",

He's not my fav but it wouldn't be fair to him if his life got ruined for possibly no reason. I couldn't care less for him as a person because I don't know him, but his situation is what I care for and I feel that people are being really unfair about it and they are looking at the situation through a lense that completely disregards his side and what could have possibly happened besides the words of a random woman on twitter, who by the way (would you look at that) also has no proof. So honestly all these people are just feeding off of the drama that they are creating and it's disgusting. It seems like everyone is completely disregarding what toll this can take on a mans life if it is fake. Which it most likely is. As sensitive as this generation is, you would think that there would be more people defending him from a logical stand point. Or at least trying to level the playing field, because everyone is automatically backing up someone who could be lying and has absolutely no evidence. I'm not saying that he didn't do it, but I am saying that her lying is also a huge possibility.",

    "postText": "I'm not a particularly good dancer in regards to Kpop (I did ballet when I was younger), so I kind of wanted to ask about what type of dance I should learn to get a good foundation and not just do \"idol dances\" if you know what I mean. Like Yujin from ZB1/Boy's Planet, where he can do like different styles of more technical dancing (ex. popping) but has only been training for a short amount of time, or like Hanbin and Zhanghao or a lot of other male idols. So should I start with hip-hop or something like that, or try to find lessons in stuff like contemporary dance, or the more technical styles like waacking and popping?",

            "comment": "Most choreos are a popping-based commercial style, I would go for popping initially and if you want a laid back, loose feel to your dancing then take hiphop too. If you're doing gg choreos whacking or vogue will probably prove useful and so too might contemporary, if you're doing bg choreos then some krump and maybe house knowledge may also help you out.",

Hip-hop classes also help develop a lot of confidence in performing and the sorts of small touches we see in idols with amazing stage presence. I also found jazz, specifically west coast jazz, helpful since a lot of it is flowing and helped me connect moves more seamlessly rather than just doing one after the other if that even makes sense.",

You can build those back up through muscle building exercises that focus on balance and flexibility (ie yoga, pilates, barre exercises). Working on that will definitely help you get better movements when dancing.",

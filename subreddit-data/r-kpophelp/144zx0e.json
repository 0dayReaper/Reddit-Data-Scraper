    "postText": "While I was scrolling through the comment section on some of JYJ's older music videos I noticed how people were praising them from getting away from their company and doing better. I saw something about how they were banned from promoting in Korea and Japan and were left only to go to America on their own. Which could possibly explain their collab with Kanye West? lol\n\nThis is only what I was able to partially gather but I really want to know the full story of why everything happened! Was JYJ always under SM Entertainment? Did JYJ's English album \"The Beginning\" do well internationally?",

SM Ent. had enormous power/influence over the industry and made it so JYJ were blacklisted from participating in the music industry in many ways. While JYJ were active they tried alternative methods to promote and perform, like making an English album and touring globally before this was a common thing for K-Pop groups to do.\n\n'The Beginning' made very little impact, but the purpose of the album (and the other music they made early on) was so they would have enough material to tour with since they couldn't be performing their old TVXQ songs anymore. And yes, that's how the Kanye collab happened. It wasn't long after the Kanye/Taylor Swift \"I'mma let you finish...\" situation had happened, so his reputation had slumped. Nothing like now of course, but yeah, the collaboration was likely just his people networking and taking random opportunities without much thought or actual interest in the project.",

            "comment": "JYJ are 3 out of 5 members of TVXQ, who debuted in 2003 under SM Entertainment. They kicked off the 2nd Gen of K-pop and were arguably the top boy group of the early years of 2nd Gen before Big Bang took over. In 2009, at the peak of their careers, JYJ sued SM for because of unfair wages and way too long contract terms, much like what CBX of EXO just did very recently. JYJ continued all TVXQ activities until the end of 2009 then after that, they formed their trio formally and released music together. They were under CJes as a trio.",

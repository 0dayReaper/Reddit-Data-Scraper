    "postText": "I recently ordered from KTOWN4U and I used PayPal to purchase. I was incorrectly charged twice and ended up being refunded twice. However, I never received an email saying my order was cancelled or anything and the only reason why I even figured out that I had been refunded twice was because I checked my bank account and found out they never charged me for sure. My order seems to be fine and they are even processing it. I asked some of my other friends who have bought with them and they told me KTOWN waits until the preorders in the purchase are ready for them to charge you. I pre-ordered the ATEEZ albums and I bought some ENHYPEN albums. Ateez isn't out yet meanwhile Enha is. Has this happened to anyone before? I also can't email CS because they don't have their email anywhere publically.",

It sounds like they may charge you later on but if they still haven\u2019t charged you after it\u2019s arrived, then that\u2019s when I\u2019d be more worried. If what you\u2019re worried about is that they also cancelled your order and it\u2019s actually not coming, sorry I can\u2019t help you \ud83d\ude2c best of luck",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve always had the dream of becoming a singer/performer. I\u2019ve only recently starting taking singing lessons. I\u2019m not good at all (there\u2019s videos on my account of me singing and it\u2019s nowhere near good). I applied to an in-person audition last night, despite the application closing the day before. I still received an email this morning saying they\u2019re inviting me. I\u2019ve auditioned online for other K-pop companies and was obviously not accepted. The audition is literally **tomorrow**. I lowkey applied for shits and giggles but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d actually invite me, especially because I applied after the application closed. I do have a dream of becoming a singer/performer but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d actually invited me to do an in-person audition. I am also in no way, shape, or form prepared to audition to-fucking-morrow.\n\n\nUpdate: I did the [audition](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/ti7ozv/update_i_applied_for_an_audition_for_shits_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

Talk about the fact you\u2019re currently in singing lessons at the moment and have made some good improvement and are clearly open to criticism based on the videos you have posted. \n\nThe worst they could say is no!

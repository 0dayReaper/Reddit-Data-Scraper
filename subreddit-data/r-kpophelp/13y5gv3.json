    "postText": "Hi so recently I bought the TXT Dicon D\u2019Festa album (mini edition) and two of the photo-cards had printing defects where the ink was messed up. (I filmed the unboxing for security reasons) \n\nWhen I asked the store about a possible refund they said they will give me $2 for the two damaged photo-cards. Is this fair? I was at least expecting a 10% discount. \n\nFor context this album is extremely difficult to purchase where I live and I paid $75 aud in total. Some advice would be helpful.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m very new to kpop and did not know where else to ask, sorry about the format",

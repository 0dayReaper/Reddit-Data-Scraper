    "postText": "My friend and I were reminiscing about funny stuff that happened throughout our years in kpop and I got reminded of this incident. \n\nMy biggest flex - Back in 2013 I managed to snag tickets to watch Exo's (technically first in their career) concert and got a spot in the standing pit by the back barricades right next to the extended stage. They were throwing gifts during encore since it was Christmas eve and lo and behold I caught a pair of gloves that Sehun kissed and threw into the crowd. There is even a [fancam](https://youtu.be/Aw70N_aaTWc) of him doing it. \n\nWould love to hear other fun stories of your kpop flexes!",

(esp bc other fans have received replies from our favs, some multiple times on twt and fancafe, but) i won a 30 second long (\ud83d\udc94) video call with my ult for a japanese album release event with only one album. i had bought the album weeks after i thought first press had sold out, but was able to get a first press copy (so i got a pc and the lottery code), and entered for the event that day, which had also happened to be the deadline to apply for the call/any overall events for that time.",

He actually told me he was heading to Maui for an MV shoot, which turns out to be for Jasmine \n\nStudying abroad allowed me to see many artists I'm a huge fan of, like who gets to spontaneously see Crush at a club \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI went to a Monsta X fansign and Kihyun remembered me\n\nI sent a video of me singing a song that Jae of Day6 covered on his old youtube to his old ig (this was before their debut) and he saw it and told me I had a great voice\n\nAhhh i've honestly been very blessed and am thankful I made so many great memories during my kpop phase!",

In the vlive, you can actually hear me say \"Be careful, it's wet!\" to Byeongkwan and he looks at me says \"Okay\" and waves at me. Then, I later shout \"I love you!\" and both he and Jun look right at me and say \"We love you more!\"\n\nThen, I luckily won the fan meeting video call with Dongkiz with their most recent comeback. I got to tell them how much they made my terrible year better with their music, and my bias Kyoungyoon said \"I love you\" and I got to say I love you too. I had some great little moments with each of them, including Jonghyeong doing a bit of the dance to ICY by ITZY, but the whole thing was just an incredible experience that still makes me giddy when I think about it.",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a flex because it certainly wasn\u2019t fun at the time, but I was blamed for ex-Super Junior member Kibum deleting all his Instagram posts two years ago. It was over Christmas as well, so the hate was *really* fun to deal with. Now I laugh about it, because he did come back in the end and most people knew I wasn\u2019t the reason he did that. \n\nSpeaking of Super Junior, Sungmin\u2019s liked a few of my comments to him on Instagram before. I also tuned into Yesung\u2019s Instagram Live once, even though I never really watch idol livestreams, and I like to believe he read my comment out loud, lol. He was just testing filters so I commented something like, \u2018\ubb50\ud574\uc694?\u2019 Just a simple, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 A few seconds later, he said \ubb50\ud574\uc694. Now, it\u2019s a common enough phrase that it was probably a coincidence, and maybe he was just asking the viewers that question. But I\u2019ve decided he was reading my comment hahahaha\n\nI\u2019m friends with Ladies\u2019 Code Sojung on Facebook. She posted the link on her Twitter many years ago. She also liked a few of my replies to her over on Twitter around that time too. \n\nI met Hyolyn at her concert in 2019. I bought VIP tickets because I had all these plans to tell her how she inspired me, what Sistar meant to me as a teenager, and I don\u2019t know... just talk to her about cats, I guess. My online friend also asked me to tell her they loved her too. But when the moment came and it was my group\u2019s turn to get the photo taken with her, I went mute (I\u2019m autistic). Couldn\u2019t say a word, not even a meek \u2018hi\u2019. Since the meeting was pretty short - it\u2019s mostly just two photos, then you have to leave - I thought I\u2019d blown my chance and that Hyolyn wouldn\u2019t talk to me, especially if I was unable to talk. To my surprise, though, Hyolyn took my hands and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you!\u201d I kind of just stood there like a dummy, probably gawking at her, because I still couldn\u2019t speak. It meant a lot because the security were trying to usher us all out and take me away after the photos, but Hyolyn grabbed my hands and spoke to me. Like she wouldn\u2019t let me leave without at least acknowledging me. Bare minimum, maybe, I don\u2019t know; it was my first and currently only time meeting a celebrity, especially one who was an inspiration to me throughout my teenage years. But it really did mean a lot.\n\nMore recently - and I still can\u2019t believe this happened - was waking up at about 4am to catch Minzy\u2019s AMA on the main K-pop subreddit. 2NE1 were my first K-pop group and got me through my teenage years. They\u2019ll forever be my ult bias. I wasn\u2019t really expecting her to respond to me, let alone answer all my questions since I\u2019d typed up about seven and I didn\u2019t want her to spend all her time answering my questions when she could answer several people instead. I figured that if she did respond, she\u2019d choose maybe one or two to answer, since that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen other artists do in previous AMAs. Was very shocked when I got the notification that she had not only replied to me, but also answered every single question. I remember just squealing into my pillow. Now every time I listen to a 2NE1 or Minzy song, I smile all big when I hear her voice because it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow. She knows I exist!\u2019",

                            "comment": "So it was Christmas Eve 2019. About a month before, he announced he was taking a break from Instagram. Knowing his tendency to just... completely vanish for years at a time, I thought he would be leaving for good. But then, on Christmas Eve, I got the notification that he had posted. It was a picture of Home Alone, though I can\u2019t remember what the caption said. So out of excitement and overall surprise to see him back so soon, I commented, \u2018YOU\u2019RE BACK??\u2019 \n\nI often commented on his posts and he\u2019d never replied before so I had no reason to think he\u2019d reply. Then my phone started blowing up with notifications related to the comment, and I realised that must mean he\u2019d replied to me. Went to check and sure enough, he had! He simply replied, \u2018sorry i\u2019ll leave\u2019. Everyone (and myself) was like haha, classic Kibum. Sarcastic as always. Took a screenshot, but within 10 minutes the post was gone. And then throughout the evening (my time; would\u2019ve been middle of the night/early morning KST) his posts all began to disappear, one by one.\n\nThe Twitter fandom reassured me it wasn\u2019t my fault since I was really freaking out in case Kibum had misinterpreted my comment as a hate comment. The Instagram fandom, on the other hand, weren\u2019t so kind, coming to my profile and telling me my \u2018hate speech\u2019 was responsible for Kibum deleting his posts whereas other people told me I should have said something like \u2018welcome back\u2019 instead. Really sucked to deal with that on Boxing Day, but eh. He returned a few days later as if nothing happened and as far as I know is still around on Instagram, so I believe my friends when they told me he was probably planning on doing it anyway. \n\nTL;DR: Dared to excitedly ask him if he was coming back to Instagram after he took a break for a month. He replied saying sorry, he\u2019ll leave. Thought he was being sarcastic/joking with me, since that\u2019s how he\u2019d interact with fans. He ended up deleting all his posts minutes later.",

Both of them mean the world to me so it was really special for them to like my comments even if they did it for others too. Gyuri and Eunjung from T-ARA\u2019s youtube channel Beauty and View also followed me &amp; liked my posts on Instagram/comments on their YT channel when they were still active, but that was probably just their staff and not them themselves. It\u2019s still cool to me though. \n\nJubi from Sunny Hill liked a post I tagged her in/viewed my story thanking her for it. This was the first time I was ever noticed by someone famous. \n\nKangyoon, Sujin, Dayoung and Gabin from Blady all viewed my story before and Kangyoon replied/like my message to her. Gabin reacted to hers as well. \n\nHyosung from Secret liked one of my tweets on Twitter and viewed my story on Instagram twice, Jieun from the same group also viewed my story two times. \n\nNoeul from Rainbow read and replied to my story once, viewed it two or three times. Jaekyung and Seungah also viewed my story but didn\u2019t reply. \n\nJucy from EVOL reposted my story post about her birthday and replied to it. I think Hayana also viewed a story of mine once, but since her account seems to be gone now I can\u2019t verify that. \n\nAreum from T-ARA has liked my comments to her and reacted to stories for her bday in the past. She also responded to me on live once.\n\nYellow Bee (when they were still active) liked a tweet I sent to them encouraging them abt their comeback, Annie and Ari also liked a YT comment of\nmine on MiniMani\u2019s ToriTori Dotori video. (highly recommend u guys check the song out btw, it\u2019s adorable) \n\nThere are a bunch of notices from others too, the ones I can remember being: Duri (D.Holic), Fly With Me/their member Shasa (they\u2019re a dance team but they released a debut song so I count them too) Trinity (GP Basic), BiPa (Lip Service), Minji (Busters), Way/Choa from Crayon Pop, and Heyne (soloist, I love her w everything in me). Most of them were likes on comments or story views with the exception of Duri and Heyne, who replied to a comment and who read my message to her on live respectively. ( I also want to say Hami and Rena from D.Holic interacted with me too, but my memory is very poor and it\u2019s likely they didn\u2019t. )But yeah, the good thing about liking nugus is that there\u2019s a pretty decent chance they\u2019ll notice you, which has thankfully happened to me quite a few times.",

My sister likes to cosplay a bit so put together a quick cosplay outfit that matched one of Apink's concepts (the schoolgirl look from Mr Chu).  As luck or fate would have it, Apink was wearing the same theme for their meet and greet outfits!  That was already cool enough but then Hayoung actually pointed at my sister's outfit and said something along the lines of \"oh we're wearing the same thing!\"\n\nMade that concert a little extra special.",

I was just a casual listener of theirs, so I wasn't freaking out like the other fans. Everyone was especially freaking out over Ren, and I wasn't sure if he was nervous or uncomfortable about the whole thing. But for each member, I just politely handed them their album to sign and said hi, and after Ren signed it, he actually extended his hand out for a handshake! I was so surprised! I had been watching his interactions with each person from the line, and he hadn't done that with anyone else. I was so flustered when I shook his hand and he said thank you for coming. From then on, I've always seen NU'EST in a positive light :)",

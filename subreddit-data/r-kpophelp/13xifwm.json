    "postText": "Until a year or two ago I was convinced that, after BTS and BLACKPINK, TWICE would be the group with the biggest fandom around the world. But with the news of the new Stray Kids album reaching 5.13 million in pre-orders alone, and seeing the mobilization of their fambases around the world to reach this record, I now think that they would be the third biggest group in K -pop currently, having already surpassed even TWICE.\r  \nI would like to ask you: in your opinion who would be the third biggest group in K-pop today, at least in terms of popularity and the size of their fandom? Would it be TWICE or Stray Kids? If you can, I would like you to explain with some plausible argument why you think so",

SKZ just broke a huge presale record for their new album, and Seventeen has gained so many fans since the release of HOT last year. Both groups have incredibly large fanbases internationally, too. I'd say that SKZ narrowly beats out SVT, though.",

I think Twice, Stray Kids, and Seventeen are all major contenders for it. \n\nSK and SVT both proved their popularity with their pre-order numbers for sure, but we have to remember that many fans probably bought multiple albums so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean their fanbase is that huge. Additionally, I believe Twice is most recognized by name internationally and both Twice and SVT have multiple members that would be recognized by people even outside of their fandoms (bc they\u2019re 3rd gen and have been around for a while). SVT also has a huge fanbase just for their variety content alone, aside from all their regular fans. SK aren\u2019t at that level yet but they\u2019re making waves and are for sure the most popular 4th gen group. So I think depending on the angle, you could make a good case for any of those three to be in the third spot.",

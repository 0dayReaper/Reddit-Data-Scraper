The point is, in most Europe tours, Eastern Europe is omitted completely. Like it doesn't exist, like they don't have fans here.\n\nNCT 127, NCT Dream and WayV don't tour here. Stray Kids don't tour here. Ateez did announce date in Warsaw, but then they cancelled and they didn't come back the next tour. The Boyz don't tour here. Twice don't tour here. The list goes on and on and on. \n\nTour announcements are just disappointing most of the time.",

The companies don't believe there are any fans in Europe. If they let their groups tour there, they mostly choose small sized venues to not risk loosing out on profit in case they won't sell out the bigger venues.\nIt's getting better slowly, as in more groups are actually now touring in Europe, but they either only visit 2-3 countries or choose a small ass venue so getting tickets is hell. \n\nAlso often you'll see them announcing World Tours and only including dates for US and Asia and then a little \"More To Come\" message underneath - nowadays they actually end up announcing Europe dates later on, but it's still a praying process and rather annoying to never be included immediately and always having to hope for the best.",

If I\u2019m extremely lucky, they\u2019ll come to a city of my country that is six hours away more or less, but again, I don\u2019t have the money for the transport + the tickets :( \n\nThis year seems to be getting better tho, there\u2019s a kpop festival in a few months with seven kpop groups (shinee, enhypen, ateez, IVE, StayC, Gravity and Xikers) which is not bad (sadly I can\u2019t go) and then later in the year KARD is going to come too (I want to go to that concert, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s possible), but that\u2019s about it. G-Idle goes to paris, AESPA too, same with WayV, Twice, Red Velvet, Blackpink, Stray Kids\u2026\n\nHell, my cousin\u2019s dream is to go see a BTS concert, but they never came. The closest was to this other city in my country, but it was cancelled due to the pandemic, she even bought the tickets (she was refunded ofc). The only ones who seem to come here is Ateez, because they were here too in December of last year, and now not even a full year later they\u2019re back with the festival. I think that I\u2019m going to fully stan them just because of that lmao, they seem to love us a lot compared with the other groups xD",

Russia used to be included too, but alas.  \nI don't see a reason for big groups to go to small cities that are uncomfortable for people to get around.   \nIt makes more sense for people to come to their capital or most recognised city, rather than a small town with even smaller venues.",

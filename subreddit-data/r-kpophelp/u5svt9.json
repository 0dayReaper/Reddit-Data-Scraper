I know a handful of guys irl that listen to boy groups and are open about talking about their appreciation for them. Therefore, my male friends and I are curious about which male idol that other male fans appreciate. Who are your favs and why?\n\nFor example, my brother\u2019s fav is Big Bang\u2019s Taeyang and had Wedding Dress on the piano completely memorized lol. He loves Taeyang\u2019s voice and overall vibe. \n\nMy guy friend\u2019s fav is BTS Jin for his personality. He says that Jin never fails to make him laugh, and that Jin is someone he would love to hang out with because he seems so funny and good-natured.\n\n(If you aren\u2019t a male kpop fan but know someone who is, I\u2019d also love to hear about their fav and why! Please be kind, let\u2019s have a wholesome time.)\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say that the responses so far are awesome. Male Kpop fans deserve the world &amp; so much love!!",

I like EXO overall because of their vocal qualities and musics; especially their winter albums\u2026 these are just mmmh *chef kiss* for me.\n\nSpecifically for Suho, I admire his leadership ability and his personal artistry. His two mini-albums are the closest to my personal taste in music from all EXO solo projects. His latest album, Grey Suit, is heavily inspired by britpop bands, whom I like too!\n\nAlso I *love* Suho\u2019s dad jokes lol.",

He can sing, dance, I was shocked to learn he debuted as a rapper at first and he\u2019s pretty good at that so he\u2019s a triple threat. What\u2019s more to say is that he basically wrote and produced all of his own songs and chooses the concepts he does each era and he\u2019s done a wide variety of genres which is even more impressive to me, he\u2019s a very talented person. He can also speak multiple languages decently well and I mean 5 whole languages (Korean, English, Chinese, Portuguese and Tagalog)\n\nI started to follow him wayyyy after Produce and after his disbandment in X1 but I wasn\u2019t even aware he was even in it until recently, I was really surprised to see his face there. Now the vote manipulation scandal may have put him in the final line up but I like to believe that he wowed the people enough to actually earn his spot, or at least, that\u2019s what I would like to tell myself \ud83e\udd74\n\nHe\u2019s also has this really sweet, down to earth personality and seems like very humble guy. He even [still lives with his mom](https://youtu.be/DwHDO9a2IOE) which is pretty interesting since it just makes him seem more like a normal person than an idol. He\u2019s kinda a dork and he\u2019s pretty funny too, plus, he has really cute face so he was definitely God\u2019s favorite creation lmao.\n\nTLDR: Good music, multi-talented man, a well approachable personality, good looking. Stream his discography and check out his comeback Colorful Trauma next month on the 4th!",

Also, when the MV for Deja Vu was released and we watched it for the first time, it was also the first we'd seen of Mingi in a while (due to his health hiatus) and when he showed up on screen, I heard my bf whisper \"Mingi\" under his breath loll.\n\nHe also likes Kai from Exo. My bf has an old, now dead dream of being a performer and he watches Kai with a little bit of envy I think. Not in a bad way, but he's expressed feelings like \"I wish that was me on stage, looking like that, damn\".",

I was suffering from homesickness, and somehow, their music resonated with me. I found a home when I was missing it. Back then, I was immediately drawn to Jimin. He is such a fantastic performer, and I love watching him tell a story as he performs. His sweetness, thoughtfulness and kind spirit uplifted me every time I was down. His passion, dedication and respect for what he does motivate me. His humility grounds me. His consistency from when I knew of him in 2014 to this day inspires me. I have never seen him take his work lightly. Jimin had been devoted since day one. Not only because he knows he was born to do this but because he also believes this is what his fans deserve from him. He's an incredible person. I wish there were lots of people like him.",

Also he is so nice to everyone and seems to be fun to be around (his laugh is so contagious). He is also very respectful and kind.",

Early on in my K-Pop experience I watched Big Bang's performance of Bang Bang Bang at MAMA 2015 for the first time, and the entire time he was on the screen my eyes were glued to him.\n\nSo you have that, but also the fact that he's one of the most wholesome individuals in the entire K-Pop industry. No scandals, fantastic singer and performer, married to the girl of his dreams AND has a kid on the way? \n\nYeah, that checks all of the boxes.",

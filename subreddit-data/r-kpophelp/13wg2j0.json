I've learned a lot from them regarding video production and stuff, and sometimes they'd point out things i wouldn't have paid attention to.\n\nI've never seen them hate a song but you can see from their reaction sometimes, i think the only time they blatantly said they didn't like a song/video was for nmixx's o.o, but i haven't watched every single video of them so idk.\n\nEdit: forgot their preferred pronounce, sorry.",

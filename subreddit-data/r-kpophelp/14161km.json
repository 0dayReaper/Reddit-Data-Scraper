It was because some armys kept spamming flags, \"please speak english/spanish/whatever language\" and comments about shipping, so I guess he got frustrated cause there weren't many interesting comments to have a productive conversation. It happened before the paris video, so I don't think it was about taehyung dating. Armys are just telling each other to stop spamming dumb things on bts' livestreams.",

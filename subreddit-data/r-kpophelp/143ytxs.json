Halfway through the video Donghyun pushes his arm to let him know he\u2019s still being filmed. I think he assumed the camera turned off during the radio break lol.",

There's a hidden cam when Enhypen was scolded by a staff and then the rest of members left Jake and Sunoo behind to prepare for his birthday cake.\n\nThis is [the prequel](https://youtu.be/4Jds3qsfLNs) of it where you can see Jake stayed behind when others are playing around. He actually was ignored by the members for his birthday prank. The thing is when this video first dropped engenes thought Jake didnt join them playing cuz he's small, and we're worried seeing him looking all sad, when in fact he was being pranked \ud83d\ude2d poor baby.",

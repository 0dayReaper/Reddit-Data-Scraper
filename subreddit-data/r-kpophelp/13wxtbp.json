            "comment": "not really no. they won artist of the year and album of the year at two of the biggest kpop award shows the year before they even broke out in the us. they were one of the top selling groups and the rivalry between bts and exo was huge in 2016. they definitely were dismissed and pushed aside as a fluke in korea by many until they blew up in the us and surpassed all the other groups, but korea and kpop fans definitely knew about them before 2017. their success in the us in 2017-2018 was what made them reeeeally stand out tho and start to get some real attention from the korean gp.",

            "comment": "I think it depends on what you mean by \"recognised\". It was before my time, but for what I read, they started doing really good in popularity, getting \"rookie of the year\" even on awards allowing votes only in their home country, and that's some kind of recognition. \n\nOnce they were out of the rookie umbrella, they got into the general pack on the race, but their use of social media helped a lot to give them a strong international following (I wouldn't think of USA as the only country for this). Or at least, stronger than other bands with a similar budget. That gave them some extra attention also at home, because the K-ARMY I-ARMY communication, with both \"sides\" sharing the other one's projects and achievements got some ripples into the domestic idol audience. Something like \"hey, these guys are growing a lot outside the country, where our music is niche, what's going on?\". \n\nThe first awards in general categories  were in South Korea, so that \"recognition\" came from South Korea too. Then they got the international awards (the first Western ones were \"Asian\" or \"World\" categories in Europe, I think, but the Top Social was the first big, general one) which in turn gave them \"recognition\" outside of the idol audience and into the general public in their home",

So with like successful songs but not PAKs and mega hits. \n\nThey transcended even that barrier  and became digital monsters and GP's pick post their blow up in the US.",

            "comment": "Not really. They won rookie of the year. Their first win was only 2 years after debut. They got their own reality shows (Rookie King and AHL) that aired on tv (so not your typical webshow/youtube content). They held tours, they were invited to all music award shows. The term EBS was coined in 2016 so they were clearly on pair with EXO (that was THE boy group at the time and a million seller) so they were recognized. \n\nAnd they won their first daesang in 2016. Daesang being THE award, the most important one. \n\nThe whole USA thing started in 2017 with billboard so you can see tha they were already popular and established before that.\n\nI know armys love to play the \"underdog\" storyline but really, as someone who was an army back then, I know for a fact BTS weren't underrated. They were selling over 20k copies as rookies in a time when there was no single release selling a million (EXO sold a million, but that's only combining all the versions of their albums, Korean and Chinese,  plus the Korean and Chinese repackage as well).  True underdogs don't get invited to MAMA or MMA, GDA or any award show, and they definitely don't win rookie awards or a daesang lol.",

The BBMAs was rhe first defining moment of BTS\u2019s career in the US - I remember my friends skipping school to watch it xD but this is all based on what I remember as an army from early 2016",

            "comment": "It is complicated, \n\nThey won rookies of the year award right in 2013 and definitely became successful starting 2015-2016 period.\n\nBut their achieving immense popularity and success, outdistancing other Kpop groups was indeed kind of outside-in.\n\nThat came with massive recognition in the West, reflecting back and boosting them in Korea. \n\nSo you can say there are 3-phases to their careers,\n\nKorean recognition, reasonable, but nothing extraordinary. This was the phase where they were rivals to EXO and others.\n\nWestern recognition, far more than any other K-pop group &gt;&gt; leading to massive boost in Korea.\n\nGlobal recognition, where they became an exceptional group having both home/foreign success, both physical/digital success.\n\nK-pop was not the dominating genre in Korea, and 30s &amp; above often don't listen to any kpop artists or recognize them. But global accolades won by BTS, ensure that people across age-groups in SK, know and were proud of BTS - Even if they did not listen to their songs or Kpop in general.",

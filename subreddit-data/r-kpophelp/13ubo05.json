    "postText": "So I don't remember the name of the song or group I'm looking for. All I remember is that the group is made up of 7 boys (probably, not sure) and in the Music Video they were in a spaceship and one glass breaking. I apologize for how confusing this sounds. And I'm not even fully sure if the song was kpop. It could have been jpop. It's been long. If anyone knows the song I'm talking about or anything similar please let me know. Thank you.",

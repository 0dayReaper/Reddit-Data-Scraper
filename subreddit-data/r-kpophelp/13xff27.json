    "postText": "(Posted here, r/kpopthoughts, and r/kpoppers with mod permission)\n\nLast year I posted a survey for queer Kpop fans in honor of Pride Month in the US and elsewhere to see what our favorite groups, soloists, etc. are, and there seemed to be interest in making it a yearly thing. So, here is the second annual [**survey for LGBTQ+ Kpop fans**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc88ZpkEE_jE5ZXIS36LCVUgICDvmmEwSdE6e5LMFWyqDeZgQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)! If you identify as LGBTQ+ in any way, please fill out the survey - it\u2019s super short, and last year's participants said it was a lot of fun! I will hopefully post the results on r/kpopthoughts at the end of June, but they will be up by early July at the latest. Also, like last year, I will be making Spotify and YouTube playlists of the songs people think are the queerest.\n\nIf you are uncertain about any of the questions or terms on the survey, feel free to comment on this post or PM me. You have to sign in to your Google account to take the survey, but your email isn\u2019t saved and I won\u2019t have access to any personally identifying information. You will be able to change your answers until the survey closes on **June 7**.\n\n[Here are last year\u2019s results if you\u2019re interested!](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/w30md3/lgbtq_kpop_fans_survey_the_results_are_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Thanks in advance for taking the survey!",

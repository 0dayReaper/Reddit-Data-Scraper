    "postText": "I want to order some albums from Olive Young because one of my mutuals on Twitter said they were really cheap and arrived quickly. However, their website does not offer me the option to pick what version of an album I want, it's just random. I wanted to buy both versions of Dreamcatcher's new album, but I'm afraid if I buy two copies, I'll just end up with two of the same version. Are they good about giving you both versions of an album?",

    "postText": "Recently discovered this song through tiktok and it\u2019s such a nice summer song, but when ever i listen to the song on spotify, it sounds almost muffled? I will put my volume up higher, but it feels like the sound quality is really bad for some reason?\n\nI listened to it on spotify, and none of my other songs have this issue. Is there just a weird mixing issue with the song?",

I personally don't hear it, but if you compare perhaps the YouTube version and it's like this too, then it is probably the song per se. I also thought my Spotify bugged on aespa's Salty and Sweet as the vocals were particularly soft, but after a few listens I just get over it.",

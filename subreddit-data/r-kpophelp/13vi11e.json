Not sure if I'm breaking any rules so tell me if I am.\n\nI was listening to Stray Kids's TOPLINE teaser ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQ251PVkew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQ251PVkew)) and at 0:42 felt like I heard that chord progression somewhere. If you have any ideas where that's from then please let me know:)",

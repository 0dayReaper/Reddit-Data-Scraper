    "postText": "My bf is an avid TWICE stan and loves groups like TWICE, (G)-I-DLE, Kep1er, BTS, Stray Kids, Loona, NewJeans, and many more. However, as I have grown to listen to kpop more, I have found that I really enjoy SEVENTEEN. I love the songs and I was quick to want to share them with him, but he immediately shut it down. He has always been weird about other people liking the same things he does, but has never really had a problem with it until I started getting into SEVENTEEN. \nAt first, I wondered if he had a history with the group, but no, he does not. I have trouble connecting with things and this is the first time in years that I've actually really liked a group so much. He told me never to talk about them and he gets very distant and cold, sometimes unresponsive, if I do. \nI changed my tiktok pfp to a silly photo of Jeonghan holding a lighter and he told me later that he considered blocking me on tiktok multiple times throughout the day because of it. I understand that kpop is his comfort \"thing\", but I feel like I should be able to share my love for SEVENTEEN with the one other person in my life who 1) likes kpop and 2) means the world to me.",

            "comment": "I've never been in this situation, however I have met people who acted like that. Most of the time, they act like this either because :\n\n1. It's an \"identity thing\". Your boyfriend doesn't only enjoy kpop, he also associates it directly with his identity. Do most people know about his hobby, and does he know anyone else irl who's a kpop fan (excepted you) ? If the answers are yes and no (respectively), maybe he's having some sort of identity crisis. He identified himself as a kpop fan, thought it was \"his thing\" which belonged to him only, but then he sees someone else irl who enjoys it. It forces him to reflect on how he sees himself.\n2. He feels ashamed. Is he the kind of person who says \"most kpop fans are hysterical/dumb/not good people, I am one of the exceptions\", or things like that ? If the answer is yes, maybe he sees kpop fans as bad people (with him being an exception) because of internalized shame (I'm a man so I know how much men can be criticized for liking kpop), and seeing you liking kpop and having a kpop pfp is challenging his own views about kpop.\n\nAlso, there's another scenario which only happens in couple :\n\n3) He's jealous. In his head, you're obsessed with other men, and even changed your pfp to another man ! Maybe he knows it's irrational (or in the worst case, he doesn't), but he feels jealous of SEVENTEEN.\n\nNo matter which scenario it is, he is not acting in a good way. If he's not willing to talk about it and change, break up. You shouldn't have to hide your hobbies/passions around your partner ! Also, if he can't share his interest about kpop even with his girlfriend, his interest is unhealthy. When I became a fan of Stray Kids and found other stays, I was overjoyed ! When you have a healthy interest, you want to share it. Gatekeeping an interest often means that he has an unhealthy view of it.",

Did it make him feel smart, or like you hung on his every word? Honestly, this behaviour is super weird (why would you not want your partner to share a love of something with you? So you can learn more from each other and experience things together?), but it sounds like he feels threatened to me tbh. \n\nDo not stop loving what you love, and when he says things like he thought about blocking you over your profile picture (Seonghwa and Hongjoong are my phone wallpaper and lock screen, and damn, I have an Ateez blanket over the armchair in our living room - my boyfriend didn't even bat an eyelid!), try explaining to him that he's being hysterical, it's making you feel uncomfortable/hurt in your relationship, and this sort of behaviour isn't normal or tolerable. \n\nYou know your boyfriend more than any of us do, because, well, we don't know him at all, so you'll know if this behaviour is a deal breaker for you or not (because if he can be like this about kpop, he can be like this about other things too - it's not the subject that's the issue, it's the fact that he treats his partner this way), but I honestly wouldn't put up with this in an intimate relationship.

            "comment": "Seconding the suggestion to treat this as a relationship issue rather than a kpop issue. \n\nDo you find he responds manipulatively in other areas? It's not normal behavior in a relationship for one person to \"ban\" something with zero input from their partner, especially without even offering an explanation. It's even more abnormal to \"enforce\" this ban through manipulative tactics like the silent treatment and making threats to block you.\n\nIf this is unusual behavior for him I think it's definitely worth encouraging him to seek professional help so he can open up to you about why this feels so big to him. This is worth setting a hard boundary on - you should be allowed to enjoy things. His discomfort is something he needs to work through, not something you need to work around.\n\nIf this behavior is normal for him, I would really encourage you to take a hard look at this relationship. You love him, yes - but are you equals? Are you partners? Can you rely on him for emotional support? Do you find yourself walking on eggshells around him? Do you make excuses for his behavior because there's no way he could know better? \n\nPeople in a toxic relationship are often accused of not loving the other person enough. Their partner will say \"How do I know you're not cheating on me?\" or \"You're just going to leave me.\" It makes that person defensive. They want to prove they've done nothing wrong. So they swing hard to the other extreme - \"I love you no matter what. I'll never leave you. Please, all I want to do is stay with you.\" This response is the goal. Instead of addressing any real problems in the relationship, they're showering their partner with love and affection. It ends up creating a dynamic in which addressing problems is equivalent to \"hating\" someone, and ignoring problems is how you show \"love.\" This isn't healthy.\n\nI hope that this isn't a pattern of behavior for your sake, OP! Just keep an eye out. If anything in the relationship starts sounding like anything I've laid out here, it's a major red flag. It doesn't mean he's the scum of the earth, but it does mean the relationship (and your boyfriend's self-esteem) has some serious issues that you cannot fix for him.",

One friend, has a bf who's ult group is TWICE, who sends her sad kpop songs, and he had no problem with her simping over Wonho (we're all in our 20s).\n\nI suggest you communicate this to him, on why it is unfair and it makes you uncomfortable.

His feelings (uneasiness, discomfort, annoyance) are valid, but in order to maintain relationships with other people, he needs to learn to act in more diplomatic ways.\n\nIn my case, if I know that I will get annoyed if someone likes a certain interest of mine, then I just try to not talk about that with other people. All my friends know I love Kpop, but I never share which groups I stan nor do I tell them about my favorite songs. I have a boyfriend and I have never tried to get him into Kpop either. I have other interests that I can bond with people over, but I just consider some things to be off-limits. If someone brings up Kpop, I\u2019d get annoyed on the inside, but I usually try to smile, say a few things, and then change the subject. So since your boyfriend is \u201cweird\u201d about it like I am, I suggest he draw boundaries too, but obviously not in hostile ways.\n\nYou guys should talk about this and try to find a compromise. Maybe no talking about Kpop with each other, or only talk about certain artists. Also, if it\u2019s that important to you to have a partner who you can stan with, you should consider if this is going to be a dealbreaker or not.",

I don't think that's such a bad thing and I think you should respect his wishes. You can still enjoy Kpop on your own time.

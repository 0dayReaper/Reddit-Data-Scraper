I just can't realize that one day they will not continue their way together.Right now SM has AESPA and even tho I'm happy for girls and their success now, the vibe that comes from girls of 4th gen is absolutely different, I don't know how to describe it. It is so hard to find a new group that you will truly love and connect with every member, energy of the group.I'm aslo not coming for any group, every group deserve their success, love, but it feels so sad that one day I won't be able to continue to listen to older groups new music.\n\nI do think that people who love Iz\\*one will more likely feel this pain, because they know the exact date of their disbandment.",

Im a huge Seventeen fan and their disbandment isn't really near but talked about quite often, SVT not only makes good music but also has GoSe which has become a necessity for Carats because it cheers them up so without it it would be quite saddening. The best I can say is enjoy and cherish the time of them still being around and don't look at their disbandment until the day comes.",

I think at any given time after 2023, they'll still have at least 5-6 members still promoting. They'll be out for the same amount of time as Exo who also have 4 years difference between their eldest and youngest. \n\nI feel for the Nctzens though, I know they work in units but like there's a 6 year difference in 127 (taeil-haechan). Wayzennies are the luckiest haha",

In EXO's case, they never promoted as less than 6 which is 75% of their members (or 66% depending on whether you regard them as 8 or 9), SVT will be down to 7 out of 13 members at one point.\n\nYeah, NCT are gonna be hit the hardest but that's probably why they persisted with the rotational concept.",

Then their contracts expired on 2017. 3 members (Sooyoung, Tiffany, Seohyun) decided not to renew their contract with SM but still a part of the SNSD official line up. The 5 remaining, which is Taeyeon, Sunny, Hyoyeon, Yuri, and Yoona formed a Sub-unit called oh!gg. They formed a sub-unit for the 5 remaining so they can still actively promote. Meanwhile, the other 3 who left SM who were still part of SNSD can also partake on their comebacks as long as their respective company agree in terms of SM. At the moment, it doesn't still happen that the girls comeback as 8 since 2017. The oh!gg sub unit debuted on 2018 and still hasnt given a comeback. But the 5 remaining girls on sm also extended their contract this year.",

Also running man (they also featured shinee's minho) if you want to be a lil bit sentimental you can watch happy together. I can also recommend their 2017 concert which is phantasia. My favorite title track is Mr. Mr. Also try listening to their japanese release bcs it is a masterpiece.",

I was a BABY, aka B.A.P fan, for 6 years. Never liked a group the way I liked them.  Their disbandment stung, especially after the lawsuits and hiatus and everything, but now I just listen to their old music and think about how great of a group they were. I got into PDX after that, and thought X1 was going to be my new group, and I fell hard despite the short amount of time we got with them. That disbandment actually hurt me more because it felt so unfair- but now I\u2019m just sort of silently watching their solo endeavors from the sidelines. It sucks but with them it stops being sad. As a WIZONE I am sad about their future disbandment but I\u2019ve honestly already been preparing myself since X1 disbanded.",

It's actually easier, believe it or not, knowing from the start when a group will disband. Otherwise you are watching your group either fall into obscurity or watching that contract expiration date come up and wonder which members will renew their contracts and which won't. With temporary groups you savor each moment and yes the final days are very hard but at least there is closure and you get to watch a whole new start for each member in their own company",

            "comment": "Block B are my ult group and I think the worst feeling is not knowing what will happen with their future as a group. They\u2019ve been through hell together since their debut. Their current company doesn\u2019t really care about them anymore now that Zico has left the company, and with so many members in the military, their future is just kind of hanging in the balance for now. \n\nThe members have reassured us multiple times that they are still together and are still a group and Zico only left the company (not the group) and is still the leader, but I guess it\u2019s a question of whether we\u2019ll ever see them release music as a group again. Hopefully once their contracts end they will all move under Zico\u2019s new label KOZ, but that\u2019s hypothetical and none of the members have hinted towards that happening, and KOZ was just bought by BigHit, so who knows. It really is just a waiting game for us Bees and it\u2019s awful lol. I hate that I\u2019m just waiting for the announcement that they\u2019ve officially disbanded because I don\u2019t WANT them to disband, but I just have no idea what direction their career will take. \n\nIt sucks because they\u2019re under the same company as ATEEZ, who are insanely popular and constantly putting out new music and I LOVE ATEEZ, they have a similar chaotic energy as Block B, but it does kinda hurt seeing KQ prioritize and pamper ATEEZ while Block B\u2014their senior group\u2014get the scraps. And I feel bad saying that because ATEEZ also gets shit on by KQ pretty often, so the stark difference between the company\u2019s treatment of the two groups should speak volumes. A lot of people don\u2019t even realize Block B and ATEEZ are under the same company. Block B used to be labeled under \u201cSeven Seasons Entertainment\u201d which was created specifically for Block B, but has the same CEO, same staff, same building as KQ Entertainment so in the past few years Seven Seasons\u2019s brand has just disappeared entirely and merged into KQ. Seven Seasons Youtube channel has become Block B\u2019s channel, and the Seven Seasons Twitter account has been rebranded into KQ\u2019s account. \n\nIt\u2019s not like Block B don\u2019t do well or aren\u2019t successful, and they\u2019re not even that old. Whenever they do manage to have a comeback (one where they can promote properly) they do really well on the charts and have won multiple trophies on music broadcasts and end of the year award shows. And I get that a lot of Block B\u2019s members are in the military right now so they can\u2019t exactly do any group activities, but the remaining members have been left to fund their own solo activities almost completely out of pocket (Park Kyung had to get a ton of brand sponsors for one of his music videos just to be able to afford a music video). IDK it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nAnyway, sorry for writing a whole essay lmao I know the feeling of waiting for a group to disband all too well. Block B\u2019s future is just kind of uncertain and up in the air until Zico returns from the military or until the other members\u2019 contracts end. I\u2019m hoping after everything they went through years ago with Stardom Entertainment that they will remain a group and continue to create music together, because they\u2019ve made it this far, but at this point who knows.",

            "comment": "This is exactly how I feel about April. This year marked five years with them and I know there won\u2019t be much longer to go from there since they\u2019re not a super popular group with lots of fans to stay together for, nor are they under a company that will basically allow them to promote forever, like SM, who refuses to disband their groups formally and just waits until it\u2019s an appropriate time to call \u201creunion\u201d and bring them back or until all the members leave the company to call a group quits. DSP is also struggling with money issues and has been ever since KARA disbanded, so they won\u2019t have a lot of money to continue supporting April if things continue to stay the same in terms of their popularity. They were not a successful group for three or so years, then they had their first hit w/Oh! My Mistake and (for some reason) took an over a yr long hiatus after that, then gradually gained more popularity after lalalilala and hello summer were released this year, but it\u2019s too late to earn all that money and promotion time they missed back. It\u2019s been 5 years, they still don\u2019t have their first win. If April had done well in those first three years, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be as worried as I am about them disbanding as I am now. \n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that DSP prioritizes KARD over April, which I understand why, since they\u2019re doing pretty well with each comeback and have probably helped the company the most financially, but I still think it\u2019s unfair that they get so much more than April does in terms of comebacks and recognition. (KARD stans please don\u2019t come at me for this. I understand that KARD are still considered an underrated group themselves, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they have a larger global fanbase than April and have received more attention from DSP.) KARD literally had three comebacks in the timespan of April\u2019s hiatus that I mentioned earlier, while the girls obviously received nothing at all. They did solo work during that time period, but it did not manage to do anything to increase their popularity as a group or make people want to see them come back more. (If anything, it only increased Naeun\u2019s popularity and not the other girls\u2019.) I don\u2019t have any problems w/KARD\u2019s members or anything, but I do think it\u2019s unfair that DSP treats them so much better as a group even if they are technically more successful. DSP\u2019S neglect of April makes me even more worried about their disbandment, since the way they\u2019re being treated makes me think that they\u2019ll be the first to go when their time comes. \n\nThere\u2019s also DSP N, a new group the company allegedly plans to debut soon, that could pose serious competition to April if they turn out to be monster rookies (although this is unlikely.) I\u2019m not sure what I think the group will be when they debut, but I theorize that it will either be a new boy group with Dongpyo in it (since their last was A-Jax who debuted in 2012 and were neglected until disbandment in 2019), or another GG who they plan on replacing April with. If it turns out to be another girl group I\u2019ll support them either way, but I secretly really hope it won\u2019t be in case they steal April\u2019s thunder. \n\nI don\u2019t like thinking about April disbanding these days, but I know I have to emotionally prepare for it somehow, and the sooner the better if I do. I think what makes it especially hard for me is the fact that there is (so far) no 4th gen group I\u2019ve found that I connect with in the same way I do April. Nobody has stood out to me enough or made good enough music (in my opinion) for me to love them in the same way. Idk what I\u2019ll do if I can\u2019t find a group by the time they disband. I just know a piece of my heart will be missing when they leave and I\u2019ll miss them forever.",

Can't imagine more than 2 comebacks a year, though. Like, maybe one comeback for summer, and another one for halloween and that's it, but in my mind there is a very high chance they will hit the 10th anniversary year as a 5 member, I can't imagine none of them leaving the group, if they ever stop promoting it will be on SM's side not on the girls.\nMaybe after the 10th anniversary they will slow down and have just one comeback a year without much promotion.",

Last year I was busy, and again, I couldn't enjoy Obsession. Now, that they barely have any promotions, I think about how I didn't enjoy it enough and wish I could've. \n\nSo, What I can tell you is: don't think too much about it, and enjoy the present time. Don't think too much about the future (this applies to a bunch of things in our lives, not just for music). Enjoy while their together doing good music you know you'll enjoy. Just think about it when the time come. Enjoy their released songs, and their next songs.\n\nI'm also thinking about got7 and Gfriend's promotions next year, If they gonna promote or not, and when I start thinking too much about it, I just go check their fanbases on Twitter, and end up forgetting.",

It's happened to other groups in the same company (who's name I wont mention because I dont want hate on my girls). But they came back after awhile.\n\nRed Velvet will be back, trust me. SM didn't invest all of this money for one thing to bring them down. SM loves money too much.",

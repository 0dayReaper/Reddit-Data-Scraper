                    "comment": "Agreed on the longevity. I think it's because groups have a life span and target audience, soloists can just keep reinventing outside of a template. \n\nBeing respected as a musician, she can and has released songs that young people, adults, and old people love (e.g. Flower Bookmark covers). She's also good at variety shows and has a good image for CFs (thus exposure), is known for being a philanthropist (hence respect of the working average folk), an admired idol because she takes care of her staff and fans well, a hard worker who transcended her misfortunes, and overall probably an ideal citizen on top of her career. She's less of a formulaic idol and more of an admired person. \n\nA brand (e.g. group names) makes trends, an admired human being creates lifestyles (I want to be like her/support her endeavors etc.) and lifestyle is a long deal.\n\nAnd I don't mean it to go against idol groups (because I love idol groups as people); just that if they're moulded towards a specific market, they inevitably grow stale when the market shifts or that the consumption fluctuates (depending on the patterns of the target audience's purchasing power, priorities, and interests). Which is why only individuals in groups thrive actively, even if their group name lasts forever.",

I was still shocked when I got there. Her face is absolutely everywhere. Billboards, shop windows, TV adverts. Even the terminals at the bank had her on them. I used to think people exaggerated how popular she is over there but no. She's as ubiquitous as Olive Young and 7Eleven. I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. \n\nI DID see a lot of Blackpink too, but nowhere near as much and mostly for things like cosmetics. Likewise NewJeans, Le Sserafim, etc. BTS I saw less of and even then mostly in touristy places.",

In comparison, I heard BTS a few times as well (but mostly in tourist places, and it was always Dynamite and sometimes Butter), and I don't think I've heard BP that much (maybe Pink Venom once at a restaurant? I did hear Jisoo's Flower in the streets though!).\n\nIU is the face of a very popular brand of soju, her ad was played A LOT on TV and because of that I could see her face on promotional posters in many restaurants that were carrying the brand. I saw Blackpink at very specific places : Adidas shops, and coloured eye contacts shops, and in a cosmetics shop on hair dye boxes. I saw quite a lot of tourism and destination ads and poster featuring BTS, mostly in tourist places and rather targeting tourists, not locals (for example posters promoting tourist places in Seoul, and a few TV ads that were promoting Busan 2030 I think)\n\nFrom these and my experience on the ground, I would say it seems IU is most popular with the general public, and in comparison Blackpink seems popular among teenage girls (based products that were sponsored) and BTS was mostly displayed to market to tourists.\n\n(Just for additional information for those interested  IVE and Newjeans were played almost on loop everywhere (to the point my husband who's not into Kpop ended up being like \"oh it's IVE again!\" lol). Taeyeon was played a lot too, what surprised me was that it was often \"I\", which was relased in 2015!)",

Then Hotel Del Luna became a global hit causing my colleagues to flock onto me asking for song recommendations of hers. \n\nIU was already a household name when she was a singer alone.

IU\u2019s fame at its peak was comparable to Taylor Swift\u2019s at its peak\u2014everyone liked her, and it transcended the K-Pop crowd to include the non-K-Pop listening adults and older people, much as Swift\u2019s early fame straddled pop and country audiences.  I don\u2019t know if the record has been beaten since, but IU used to have the biggest domestic-selling song of all time in Korea (\u201cYou and I\u201d), even beating \u201cGangnam Style.\u201d\n\nJust like with TS, IU\u2019s fame has lost some of its shine takes to amassing some haters, but she\u2019s still pretty big and stands out as one of the few idols who are also regarded as serious musical artists.",

She sends her fans after her exes but downplays her cheating on Calvin with Tom and cheating on Tom with Joe (and most likely cheating on Joe with Matty). Not to mention, her insanely creepy relationship with Connor Kennedy where she started dating him while he was 17 and she was 22 right after his mom died and how her pr has completely buried that relationship while she attacks her exes for their ages (although unlike her they date actual adults).\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt; What relevance does her current relationship status have to do with her announcing the tracklist to a re-recording of a 13 year old album ? (Which btw they were forced to do because someone already got a hold of the CD and leaked the vault tracks)\n\nLol, do you think her announcing her breakup with Matty and the SNTV tracklist on the same day was a coincidence? She did it so that she can bury the story about her dating a well-known bigot. Why do you think big magazines like Rolling Stone are going around writing essays defending and making excuses for her dating a racist? Plus, isn\u2019t it funny how she continued dating Matty after it was revealed that he gets off to abusive \u201cporn\u201d of Black women getting brutalized but right after it was revealed that he listens to a podcast that makes fun of her, she suddenly dumps him.\n\n&gt;&gt; So why exactly would you hate her and not her fans instead ?\n\nHer fans are not the only ones calling her an ally, she created an entire documentary where she claimed that she would speak up against racism, sexism , and homophobia. Yet, she did not speak about the drag bans or any of the other homophobic bills being rolled in states like Tennessee and Florida despite holding concerts in those states. Funnily enough, the only time she\u2019s spoken up this year is on the first day of June just like every other corporation pretending to care about Pride Month. Although, I guess this isn\u2019t surprising since this is the same woman who created an entire song saying that her getting hate was equal to homophobia. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; Goddamn I didn't like the whole Matty Healy thing either and I will fully admit that I am biased as a Swiftie but some of the lengths people go to to hate on TS is insane .\n\nThere are no lengths people are going to hate on her. She willingly dated a racist despite claiming that she cares about racism and she is rightfully getting flack for that. The way you Swifties are trying to downplay Matty\u2019s actions and her choosing to date someone like him is actually insane but like leader, like cult. Let\u2019s not forget that this is the same woman who acted in a movie directed by an abuser despite branding herself as a feminist. Poor, innocent Taylor, how dare she be held accountable for her actions! \n\nYou can be a fan of her all you want that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she likes racists, took advantage of a 17 year old whose mom had just died while she was 22, and worked with an abuser all while creating a documentary claiming that she would speak up against important issues, sending her fans after her exes who large age gaps with her, and crying misogyny anytime she gets criticized.",

BP has a lot of individual and group CFs that are brands also popular in Korea; thus seen often. While in recent years BTS is known at a group name level because they do nightly news segment interviews, large scale events and frequently in the news for one thing or another. I suspect both BTS &amp; BP most popular songs are known and have great longevity on charts.\n\nWhile IU basically charts anything from titles to bsides.",

She doesn't have a dedicated fandom and she doesn't cater much to fandom culture, which is harder because gp is fickle, and if they like the song they will listen. If they don't lile the song, they will drop it, doesn't matter if you're an internationally popular idol or group. IU caters to what GP \"would probably\" like. Which is amazing because she actually has talent to put out songs that the gp like..... everytime! Since the gp likes her songs, she is known everywhere. And I don't think any korean would not recognize IU if they see her in the streets.",

If someone asks me are you a kpop fan now, I am little hesitant to say I am; I made myself to say Oh, I love the old k-pop and miss them. Is it just me or anyone like this?",

I've started listening since TVXQ and watched a bunch of shows like Love Letter and X-man way back when to know the regular casts in those variety shows (better half of them are irrelevant now, either retired or got into messy scandals).\n\nI can count my friends with one hand who still follow kpop to this day. I have a close friend who we constantly talk about kpop and also stanned TVXQ real hard. We reminisce about the old times but unlike that \"first love\" excitement due to novelty and naivety, we now appreciate kpop groups with values that we've built up throughout years of observing these groups come and go.\n\nOur current stan is seventeen, albeit 8 years late maybe, but as a boy group, it's got a lot of elements that make us cherish them that much more. I joked to her once that seventeen is the \"could/should/would-be\" of the TVXQ that didn't disband and SJ/EXO that never lost any member.\n\nTime spent with kpop was well worth it. The idols who stood the test of time (and remain scandalless) are true inspirations.",

I took a \"break\" from it (still listening to it but not really following new groups and releases) around end of 2017 start of 2018, due to many events (Jonghyun's passing, Yonghwa my ultimate bias enrolling in the army, Hoya leaving Infinite, etc...).\n\nI got back into it mid-2020, due to lockdown and extreme boredom lol There was just SO MUCH content to consume, in the few years I was \"away\" variety shows developped a lot on Youtube, everything was so much easier to access! In the early 2010s you had to watch shows like We Got Married or Hello Baby cut in 13 parts and in 240 resolution ahahah My biases were just a bunch of pixels on my screen, now I can watch performances videos in 4k\n\nMy advice, OP, would be not to hesitate to take a break for if you can't relate to it, or if it doesn't spark joy for you any longer. You'll feel a bit of FOMO at first, but explore other interests you have, maybe other music genres, series, video games, movies, etc...\nThere might be a time in the future when you'll want to go back to kpop and want to explore it again. There will always be new groups, new contents, news songs, new performances to be excited about :)",

I wish I had learned the dances and really leaned in more when I was 24.

                            "comment": "Hey there fellow ajumma ;)\nLiking younger groups is no problem at all. The entertainment industry in general values youth : as we are getting older ourselves most new idols, artists, singers, actors, musicians etc... will all be (much) younger than us. That's how it is, so there's no point thinking you can't like artists that are younger than you or that will greatly limit the things you can enjoy as time passes if you only allow yourself to like older artists ;)\nWe might not relate to them the way we used to, but if you like the music, the performance, the dance, or even just the atmosphere of kpop in general, then just enjoy it.\nAnd especially don't feel guilty liking Seventeen : they're all grown adult men who make great music and hilarious content.\n\nNow if it does really make you feel sad or anxious, more than it makes you happy, then it's 100% a sign you should take a break and maybe distance yourself for a little while. Kpop stays a hobby, and no hobby should make you feel bad about yourself, it should be pure enjoyment :)\nI hope you'll be able to find the right balance and feel better!",

I do like some things here and there, though. I haven't been excited about a K-Pop release since Park Hwayobi's album 8 back in 2016. I feel that the debut of true talent stopped with the transition to the 3rd generation.",

Now me and kpop are more like a marriage, it's always there, reliable, brings joy, and I have a much deeper understanding of the genre and Korea in general. But it rarely shocks my world anymore.",

Idols can't speak freely without getting bitched at or they have to apologize for saying things that aren't even offensive.  The Bangchan incident that recently happened comes to mind. Social media has changed how fans are fans and this is coming from someone who watched the height of the YouTube kpop era with BigBang, SHINee, EXO, Girls Generation, etc. I usually don't post in the kpop forums unless it's someone asking questions because usually people say things like, \"Boy groups don't get love.\" \"Girl groups don't get love.\" \"Idols are rude compared to before.\" \"This idol doesn't dance as well as everyone says.\" \"This group shouldn't be so popular.\" And I just don't agree with most of the conversations being had.",

Cookie by NJ is one example. Ugh..",

I've been following K-Pop since Gen 1 when I grew up listening to BoA in high school.\n\nI remember when I used to go to Korean grocery stores to specially arrange for them to help me get K-Pop cds shipped to me, all arranged by their families or friends back home. It used to be very difficult to get K-Pop music. Later on there were Asian speciality stories but but not specific to just K-Pop. C-Pop and J-Pop too.\n\nThese days not only is music more accessible via streaming, but they tour! We have K-Pop specific stores locally now so I don't have to die with international shipping unless I want specific preorder bonuses. I also love how now, K-Pop artists the world now. Granted, tours could improve where I live (Australia), but tours not coming here won't stop me from seeing concerts.\n\nI'm actually flying to Bangkok to see (G)I-DLE next month because they're not coming here and they're my favourite girl group. \n\nI don't think I struggle to befriend people who love K-Pop since it's beyond age. Music is universal and there is no age limit. But also, I don't feel old either, aha! \n\nFor me, a lot of artists have come and gone but my favourites that I listen to are (G)I-DLE, Stray Kids, ATEEZ, Monsta X, Wonho, Everglow, Twice, and BIGBANG.\n\nNow, I'm a review writer. In my country, I'm actually one of the top K-Pop reviewers. Mostly, I focus on the concerts because I still have a day job, but I'm still so proud that I get to review K-Pop.\n\nI've reviewed Twice, Stray Kids, Monsta X, Eric Nam, ATEEZ, Alexa, just to name a few. I built a review website over the past 6 years by myself and now there's 12 of us where we cover film, theatre, live music, gaming, and all things in between. Because I have help now, I get to focus on things I love which includes K-Pop.\n\nI'll be reviewing BLACKPINK's concert in my city this weekend. Sometimes I still feel I need to pinch myself that I get to do this. But growing up listening to all the different generations of K-Pop, it wasn't really a waste of time after all. I'm very, very grateful for my K-Pop journey.",

If 2nd gen makes you happy listen ton what makes you happy. You\u2019re still a kpop fan, you just like previous period in Kpop.

That way I got to know new kpopgroups and keep up with new songs(it wasn't even my purpose). \n\nThere is so much variety within kpop itself. You don't have to participate in stan culture. You can just listen to music and not knowing groups. Try r/kpophelp. People post a lot of threads with recommendations of songs/groups. There is something for you. \n\nTry groups such as The Rose, Xeed, Ikon, Kard. \n\nI also listen to a lot of languages. It doesn't have to be all kpop. Good luck with finding your spark again.",

I discovered kpop around 11 with f(x) and japanese versions of girls generation (i was into anime a lot at that time so japanese versions would sound better to me back then). \nI stuck to those until 2016 when Blackpink debuted \nIn 2020 SM announced aespa and i was immediatly in love with them. In the last 2 years i started actually looking deeper into kpop.\n\nWhat I can say as someone who had knowledge more than half of my life of the genre and industry, but digging more into it as an adult, is that you are never too old! \nIndeed, now i can not enjoy as much a concept based around school life and being a teenager in general. I can appreciate the concept, sound etc but I am not able to connect to it as I would have been in my teenage years. \nOn the other hand, by having all these years of knowledge in more genres since I had time to listen and appreciate a wide variety (metal, pop, electronica, edm, ebm, balkanic country music, kpop, jpop, trap, rap and so on) now I can enjoy more mature concepts at a deeper level then i would have in my puberty.\nYea, i can not fangirl either like back then. I would collect albums, put up posters but not like back in the school days. \nYou are never too old to enjoy anything! Applies for music, movies, books. You become too old to be idolizing over a thing targeted to a younger demographic, which is normal progress in life",

I do feel a little creepy from time to time about how much older I am than newer groups, but honestly I don\u2019t engage with much content outside of the music. I will occasionally watch music videos, survival shows and variety shows but I never look at extra content that\u2019s put out on apps like TikTok or bubble or whatever the kids are using these days. I can still enjoy the music that I like and only occasionally get hit with the \u201crealization\u201d that maybe I\u2019m too old for this shit. \n\nFor me it\u2019s increasingly difficult to connect with the fanbase. There\u2019s a huge world view difference even between millennials and gen z and it\u2019s glaring obvious even online. Sometimes reading through the discussions and comments on kpop subs makes me feel exceedingly disconnected and it makes me not want to comment on stuff.

            "comment": "I think as you get older as a kpop fan, you kinda start to shift what aspects of it you are into. When you're young, it's about how the idols being people you look up to and \"idol\"-ize or find attractive/crush on and all that first and foremost and the talent of what they do is mostly second. \n\nBut as you get older you kinda shift to focusing on the vocal talent, the dancing talent, the work the creative team put into the concept, the music video production/direction, the live performances, who has great stage presence, even becoming more interested in the business side of things (beyond just \"omg the label treats my fav bad\" type stuff), etc, etc. I've mostly left behind relating to the lyrics, having a bias, the Stan culture/fan war stuff, etc. Though! One thing i'm finding out over the last year or so. If you time it right, you will see the trends lean back to stuff that you loved when you were younger. Like i was a kid/teen in the 2000's/2010s. So seeing a lot of the kpop trends have a big Western 2000s/2010s resurgence makes a lot of it easier to enjoy and relate to again.\n\nHonestly, the best part about being an adult kpop fan is having adult money to spend on merch and concerts. Just makes me wish more kpop acts had merch that was a little better for the adult fans. A lot of it is like school binders/pens and keychains or shirts/hoodies that are a little too loud and attention seeking to wear outside of kpop spaces when you're an adult lol. I wish there was more merch (particularly shirts/hoodies) that were subtle \"if you know, you know\" art and logos and not it screaming that it's kpop merch. But that's just me.",

I don't think I missed a single scheduled event that SHINee had back when I was still in high school, I always found the time to watch things, haha.

Dreamcatcher is another one of my favorite groups now but I don't really follow their schedule much outside of watching music show stages here and there. \n\nI feel a tremendous amount of nostalgia for the 2nd/3rd gen days. Not just for the music, but also all the time I spent interacting with other fans online.

I was going through the phase where I was unsure of my sexuality. I was also never serious about feminism since I thought it was all about women's empowerment only and I had many misconceptions regarding it. Tbh, many female soloists are the reason I started enjoying k-pop. As I kept exploring it by myself, I came to know about BTS. Then I couldn't stop and never got out of it. It has been almost 7 years, I am exposed to almost every aspect of k-pop. I also take breaks when it's too much for me to keep up with it. I am finding myself in a situation these days where I can hardly keep up with most groups esp. newer ones. Even many female soloists I used to follow are not active as much as before. Oh, I also stay away from fandom drama which is even more time consuming and is now really useless if you try to reason with other fans. I focus on a few groups only. I still love BTS, but there are other active groups as well that I admire for being so passionate like SKZ, ATEEZ, SEVENTEEN, ONEUS, MAMAMOO and TWICE and I love their music. I follow more groups as a casual fan. Despite all of these, I can't vibe with them as much as I do with BTS. THE BOYZ gave me almost the same vibe tho during their debut era and I think they also had potential but due to lack of promotion and ignorance of their agency, they couldn't do much. I feel bad for it.",

My biggest problem though is the way K-Pop (both internationally and domestically) mistreats idols over the age of 25, more so with women than men. So many boy groups can go on for years and years and get an infinite amount of praise yet if a girl group does it, they are ridiculed for being \"too old,\" or that they should retire. It's truly disgusting, and while this attitude has always been an issue, the fact that it STILL is a problem after several generations really just infuriates me more and more.\n\nI am a diehard BBGirls (ex-Brave Girls) fan, and I cannot begin to tell you how often I see very toxic and harmful comments towards the members just because they aren't infants. As if your talent and dreams should just stop at the age of 25? I think after all these years of being vastly involved with K-Pop and not seeing any change towards the mistreatment of idols has finally taken a toll on me. While I am still a K-Pop fan, I feel like as time goes, I've stepped away from involving myself with fans because they just make it so awful being a K-Pop fan. Don't even get me started on how fans of certain groups act, it's embarrassing. Anytime people ask me what I listen to and I say K-Pop I have to quickly add, \"But not a fan of (this group) or (that group).\"",

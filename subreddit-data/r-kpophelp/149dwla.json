    "postText": "There's one particular song bit that keeps playing in my mind, but I don't know much about it because it appeared in a random playlist. However, I do remember the melody to some extent.\r  \n\r  \nThe melody is very similar to Apink's \"Mr. Chu,\" with the lyrics \"I'm falling falling for your love,\" but I believe it's not \"Mr. Chu.\" The lyrics go along with \"I...\" or \"Aya...\"\r  \n\r  \nHere are some additional details:\r  \n\r  \nArtist: It belongs to a girl group, similar to Apink, WJSN, GFRIEND, and Lovelyz.\r  \nTempo: Mid-tempo I guess? It's slower than \"Mr. Chu.\"\r  \nTitle, Artist, Art Cover, Release Year: I don't know\n\n\r  \nThis melody is driving me crazy, and I hope you can help me. . Any recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "\"I'm falling falling for your love\" is from Mr. Chu though. Could it be the [on stage version](https://open.spotify.com/track/4cpVTktQTFEgrjKcLGFDX8?si=dniuDhbxSROLdwQCYujg5w) of their song?",

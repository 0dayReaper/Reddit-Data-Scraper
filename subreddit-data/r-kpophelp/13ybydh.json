Or is it, for example, a metaphor for a road that's sinuous and hard to navigate?\n\nThank you in advance \u2764",

So from the interpretation, the lyrics indicate that they are such an exclusive \"car,\" they are able to swerve on the road without that worry. Probably a reach, but I was thinking that they thought of the reference because the five stars led to dragon ball imagery (the balls have stars on them).",

You're absolutely not supposed to speed such roads because you'll likely crash unless you don't know the road very well\u2014skz are saying with this lyric that they are extremely sure about what they're doing.",

Tbh it could be both at once, since the DBZ serpent road could probably be described as serpentine/dangerous like in your interpretation, and the meaning of \"we know what we're doing, that's why we won't crash/fall\" works very well. Thank you for answering!!",

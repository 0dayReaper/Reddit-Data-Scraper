Already doing stadium tours and breaking into the Top 10s on major market charts.\n\nAfter dynamite was just like taking the cork off a champagne bottle. Just skyrocketed to a level that it\u2019s difficult for any artist (kpop or not) to meet or surpass.",

SVT maybe, after them. But keep in mind this is like, still very far from BTS.",

I don\u2019t see them mentioned as much as BTS, but they certainly have a large following that seems to just be growing. Same could be said for a few other groups like TXT and ATEEZ. Black Pink is also quite popular world wide.",

Even the BTS members' solo work chart better in the west than these groups' releases. The only kpop individual who is more popular than bts in the West is Psy, and they don't always realize he's kpop.",

There\u2019s a lot of groups with lots of popularity just not at the same level as BTS.\n\n- Twice does have the potential with their Billboard award and playing in stadiums as the first girl K-pop group. \n\n- TXT could since they\u2019re headlining Lollapalooza and finishing up a big tour. Same for Stray Kids, Seventeen, Ateez,  and Enhypen. They had really good tours over the last year or so and Enhypen is playing in bigger venues later this year. \n\n- New Jeans because they got soooo much international hype after Hype Boy and OMG/Ditto. Same with Fifty Fifty and Cupid. \n\nI think at this point, it\u2019ll be down to luck and the right marketing strategy for the groups.",

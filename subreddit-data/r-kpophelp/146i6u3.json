    "postText": "Like the title. I've never been to a concert, let alone a kpop one, ever. And now that I'm properly earning my own money, as well as groups coming to my country. I finally have the ability to fly/drive out to the major citys to see these concerts.\n\nHowever, I don't have many friends who are interested/have the funds, so I would be going to these alone. Which I'm fine with, I'm just a little worried I'll do something wrong, because I want to get the most out of my tickets.\n\nAny help regarding small and large venues/groups would be great \ud83d\ude05",

            "comment": "Buying tickets: Most concerts rely on Ticketmaster to buy tickets, which I and many others hate them with a passion. You wait in an online queue until they go for sale, and then compete with others and bots for tickets. Usually they'll have regular tickets, VIP tickets (additional benefits), and platinum tickets (super overpriced with no benefits). They also charge a ton in fees so expect to spend $50-$100 more than you would for that ticket.\n\nArriving at the concert: Every venue has their own rules, but I recommend bringing a clear bag (easier for security), and also make sure you don't have any banned items with you. My mom got stopped for having a box cutter once. With assigned seating it doesn't matter as much what time you arrive (unless you care about merch, in which case it could sell out). For GA it's a good rule of thumb to arrive 2 hrs before, but if you want front row you'll have to camp out like 12 hrs before.\n\nMerch: Merch lines are super fast so try to decide what you want before you get up there. Merch is quite expensive ($60 average for hoodies, $20 for photocards / keychains, etc) so make sure to bring enough. If you get there early they shouldn't sell out of anything, but if you go late they might.\n\nAt the concert: I would bring foam earbuds if you have any sensitivity to loud noises, but I had no issue myself (which was quite surprising). Make sure not to stand in aisles which security will definitely remind you of. Also if you record the concert, please be respectful of others and don't hold your phone as high as you can. (I hate that so much).",

            "comment": "- dress comfy ! especially if youre in general admission, outside, or plan to jump around a lot.\n- feel free to make friends with those around you as they may go to more concerts in the area so u can meet up each time.\n- bring a bag even if ur pants have pockets for your wallet or miscellaneous items (deodorant, physical tickets, etc.) but make sure to check the locations bag policy\n- merch can be a hassle so if you have an assigned seat, get in the merch line before the concert. if you dont have an assigned seat, its up to you when to get in line, youll just have to judge how important your spot is and whether ur willing to lose it (if u make friends, they can be an advantage in saving your spot) \n- personally i like to bring a charger, especially if i have a ride coming to get me after and my camera uses all my phone battery",

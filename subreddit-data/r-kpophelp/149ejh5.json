    "postText": "So the first episode just aired yesterday and the voting is gonna be open for a week. However i was quite surprised by it because youll get to vote for the 7 members and the most voted combination is going to be the one ? Or am i wrong ? Also im also curious, are they gonna keep the \"up down battle\" thing throughout the show or was it just for the 1st episode ?",

            "comment": "seems like that's the case but they could always change their mind...so far the producers said the final lineup is 100% fan voting.  50% SK, 50% international.\n\ni think the up-down is just for the contestants themselves to determine team formation for missions.  not sure if they'll do that for all missions.  fans vote for final lineups but contestants themselves will play a role in the actual mix of teams for the show.  they film all the missions far in advanced (end of april for ep1/2) so fans can't really participate in that.",

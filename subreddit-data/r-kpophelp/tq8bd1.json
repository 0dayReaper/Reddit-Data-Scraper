It\u2019s an acoustic song and there is a bit of rap but it\u2019s very soft and comes across more like spoken word than a harder hitting rap part.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m still not as familiar with their work older than that though sorry!",

Watched stray kids for kingdom, got really charmed by ateez with their personality especially with how wholesome their interaction was with skz (i alr knew about their music since debut but i never botheres checking out their recent releases, and before them they were \u201cmeh\u201d to me) Got interested to check their recent comeback which was fireworks during that time, but found out it wasnt my taste so i left them out. Tho undeniably i was still very much interested to know about the boys (yeosang and hongjoong esp, they both stole my heart during kingdom) so i checked out weekly idol just to know about the members and i thought man these boys are wholesome asf. Gave their other bsides in fever part 2 a chance and i thought oh??? Bangers? Only fireworks was a miss?? And here i am now lol. \n\nWouldn\u2019t say their music didnt really hit bc i was very much into thier bsides that time (celebrate my love) but the skzteez agenda was so strong in kingdom i couldn\u2019t help but still gave them another chance.",

I like them as a concept, but (among other issues, like excessive repetition in the chord progressions &amp; choruses), I feel like, if you're going to be as heavily focused on rap as they have been, you need to bring solid, in-depth content (wordplay helps too) and a unique voice. Blackpink hasn't had that for me. I like some of their older tracks, but The Album was very inconsistent; when I liked the instrumentals, some other element (like the lyrics or chorus) messed things up; when the lyrics were OK, I didn't like the instrumentals. This isn't really Blackpink's fault; a lot of this is how YG produces &amp; writes for them. Regardless of how they treat their artists, SM knows how to use lesser-skilled K-pop rappers to spice up songs (see Aespa, F(x)). YG has always had good rappers (G-Dragon, T.O.P., CL), but Blackpink doesn't measure up to that imo (despite Jenny's solid flow) and it feels like YG is sort of trying to shoehorn them into the same hole their predecessors have fit, even though they might be better suited to something else.",

I do like WayV's music, but the other subunits don't really do it for me musically. With NCT it's all about their personalities and I'm really enjoying all of their non-music content. I've just started watching Johnny's Communication Center, that aerial yoga episode he did with Mark was really funny.",

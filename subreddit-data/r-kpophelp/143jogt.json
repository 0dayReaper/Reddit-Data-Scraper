            "comment": "Depends on who you ask. People have very different opinions on what \u201ckpop\u201d is. Even Koreans.\n\nIf you think kpop simply means idol music, then she started out as a kpop star, but developed her career into something \u201cmore\u201d than that. \n\nIf you think kpop is Korean pop, then yea she is a kpop singer.\n\nIf you view kpop as a genre, then according to Spotify, she is a kpop star. But according to Spotify, so are Korean rock singers from the 70s.\n\nIf you view kpop as a subculture then\u2026 it will still depend on who you ask. Some people say she is kpop, because she goes on music show and follows certain kpop traditions. Others would say she\u2019s more of a ballad singer.\n\nI\u2019ve heard people say that she isn\u2019t a kpop idol because she\u2019s an artist, but does that mean that no kpop idols are artists? Not even the ones that produce music, writes songs or create choreographies? You can decide on that for yourself.\n\nSo to sum up, people have different opinions, and there is no clear answer because there is no clear (or at least commonly agreed upon) definition of what a kpop idol is.",

            "comment": "IU actually considers herself as both and even says she doesn't see being an idol as different from being a musician. \n\n*\"First of all, I personally don't think idols and musicians are different. I don't think \"idol\" is a lower title than \"artist\" or \"musician,\" so I disagree with that idea that someone is higher and someone is lower. It's good to be an idol,\"*\n\n\\- IU, Pieces:29th Winter (2022)\n\nMany people no longer consider her as an idol because her appeal goes beyond Kpop. That doesn't mean she doesn't consider herself as one. In fact, she still retains certain practices that are common in the idol industry, namely a fan club with official merch and perks, her own light stick, as well as a yearly Season's Greetings merch. She maintains a healthy relationship with Uaenas (a lot of whom have stayed with her for many years and now have families of their own), so we are not starved for content.",

Her last few albums have been the more elaborate kind you usually see with photocards and other inclusions (her earlier albums were pretty simple digipacks.)\n\nBut her music is usually more singer-songwriter than what you would find in kpop. She doesn\u2019t play into the \u201cgirlfriend\u201d trope so it was no big drama when it was announced she had a boyfriend.\n\nShe\u2019s done a ton of acting, and also releases some cover albums of older songs, which have made her even more famous in the GP\u2019s eyes. But she also has a dedicated fanbase you would typically see in the idol industry.\n\nMaybe IU needs her own category.",

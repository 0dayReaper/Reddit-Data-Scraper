    "postText": "So I was looking at NiziU profile out of curiosity to see their ages and I got really shocked at how young they are. I mean, the youngest is 15 this year, FIFTEEN. \nFor some reason I can\u2019t stan any group that has members younger than me so seeing all these new groups younger and younger makes me think it won\u2019t take long for me to just stop stanning and keeping up with new kpop groups. I already thought IZONE had a too young lineup but NiziU really depressed me. Anyone else can relate?\n\nEdit: why are people still replying this post was over 13 days ago lol",

On the contrary, being exposed to a music that is always new and young is refreshing most of the times. \n\nOne thing that bothers me (related to age) is, sometimes i want to hear mature voices other than in the middle of puberty ones.",

I've been into Kdrama for about a year, sort of stumbled on them on Netflix and now basically watch nothing else (though I prefer Viki for shows I can get on there). Fell in love with a lot of the songs, made Spotify playlists and then kept being recommended other Korean artists. Just fell down the rabbit hole really, and while I'm not a huge Western pop fan (I'm more into alternative, metal, indie and industrial) I just really love Kpop. The cheerful songs make me want to dance, and the sad ones bring all the feelings. I suppose it makes me feel younger, and reminds me a bit of the pop music I loved in my teens. It's much better than that, frankly, but the spirit of it is wonderful. The showmanship is something I also love, having been a performer for 20+ years.",

What are some of your favourite dramas and OSTs? \n\n\nMy favourite drama of all time is Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo, and my top three include Itaewon Class and Angel's Last Mission: Love. One thing those have in common as the stories are so different is that I LOVE the OSTs in all three. \n\nWeightlifting Fairy really introduced me to Korean music and I fell totally in love with the soundtrack. Standing Egg are one of my favourite groups now (though they're more indie than pop I guess) . One of my favourite OSTs was Hwarang. So many great songs! I like the songs much better than the show tbh... but there's so much good stuff out there. Search: WWW introduced me to Mamamoo who are probably my group bias, but I can't choose a member bias as Iove them all and have a different favourite every day.",

English is not my first language so idk how to phrase it well but that's just what I think. It's like people our age saying \"I don't believe people who born after 2005 exist\" as a joke, cause it's just so bizarre to us. Just like what the other person says, I think we would get over it in a few years. But yeah it is indeed very awkward cause we used to have so many \"oppa/unnies\" in kpop but suddenly we're the \"oppas/unnies\".",

It honestly bothers me to see too young faces sometimes (Wonyoung looking like a literal baby and being center of 11 of her elders is so uncomfortable and jarring to me for example), but most of the time they give young idols young concepts, and then I can get behind it. I don't want to see idols in their twenties doing cute or bratty or too innocent concepts, and I don't want to see idols in their teens doing mature or sexy or girl crush concepts. There are concepts appropriate for each age group, and I am fine with seeing kids doing kid things on stage :)",

I had a bit of a \"oh shit\" moment realizing that from now on, it's more likely that all idol groups will be younger than I am. It took some time of thinking about it, not gonna lie, but I got used to it quickly. I enjoy almost all kpop regardless of the age of the people performing! Why feel bad that someone's age is a different number? Nowadays I'm more like \"let's see if everyone is born in 2000 and after!\" as a game (\"yesss, 5/5\") instead of as a way to feel bad about my age. There is a lot of great insight in this thread about adopting a healthy mindset about this, so I was happy to read through it!\n\nP.S.: Going to a BTS concert at 27 and being on the older side for age was a bit weird lmao.",

Not sure on his exact age? 17? First heard of him due to a friend getting into X1 (rip). He's adorable and I feel parental about him the few times I've seen pics of him on social media since X1 d-worded. I hope he's eating well.

If you feel like your age is a strong part of your identity and you want to be as young as possible then it'll bother you.\n\nThe product itself (Kpop) will always stay the same, meaning all the things you enjoy about Kpop (the music, the style, the dances, the concerts, the high budget Mvs, the variety shows) will always exist (but of course adapt to the time).\n\nSo if one factor can make you stop liking something you initially did, won't that be sad for you? Of course i understand disliking it if there's very young minors, because it's creepy but as you grow up the idols will always stay 16-23 years old. You're free to stop liking a product for whatever personal reason but it's way more healthy to grow out of it naturally like i am at age 19-20 from watching kpop for a whole decade.\n\nEdit: I notice that there are a lot of teenagers here who feel old because they aren't the youngest in these new groups and if that upsets you so much, then you're in for a rude awakening because years will go by you so fast and as you get older you'll probably be very self conscious as you can't stop it lol.",

She is adored by all men in Korea and she looks 100% like her age (meaning it's not like she looks like she's in her early 20's).\n\nShe is successful, beautiful, has one of the hugest age gaps in a group yet is the most popular member in Korea. If international people call her old, do you think it affects her as much as those hate commentators wish it did?\n\nIt just proves that even if you're considered old by many, you can still be really happy and satisfied with your life and be more adored than many younger people. Of course i don't think anyone needs to be an Irene (aka one of the biggest supermodels ever) to be satisfied with their life at 30 but it shows that even if you're old by their standards (and female), people can still like you just as much as they would when you're younger or even more. \n\nI'll be honest and say that it doesn't bother me as much, and i don't know why i guess i just get easily happy but all of those people who call her old will be depressed when they themselves get old, regardless of whether or not they like Kpop at 25-30 years old.

I'm a ARMY too and stanning BTS was a lot of fun and comfortable, partly also because they're all older so they felt further. But seeing people my age debut and excel makes me feel a little sad because I realize that now I'm also in that transition to adults and that scares me a little I guess. When I was young I wanted to grow up fast but now that I'm about to become an adult it makes me feel worried. And seeing my \"juniors\" debuting and already working definitely adds on to that feeling. But this post and the comments really helped me! I'm glad I wasn't the only one feeling this way.",

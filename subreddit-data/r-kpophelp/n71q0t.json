Nowadays, we rarely see top idols who come from modest backgrounds, but the mentality that idols are from poor families stayed. I don't think most idols are very rich though. Maybe upper middle class. Smaller companies still debut idols from modest families.",

If there were that many from wealthy backgrounds we wouldn't hear about former idols working in cafes and other mundane jobs after quitting all the time. You have to remember that most idols aren't at big 3 companies, where you will find most if not all of the idols with wealthy families. It's important to know that SK's current wealth is about as old as the upper end of the 3rd gen idols. Before 1988 SK was a military dictatorship and very few Koreans have become rich since then. Many have moved into the middle class and live comfortably. There was an economic crisis in the early to mid 1990's SK that almost ended K-Pop completely and it seems like stans have no idea about that. Also, SK has the highest personal debt per household in the world. \ud83d\udc40 With that in mind please refrain from making broad statements about idols finances because you clearly don't know anything about SK's history or economy.",

I love Ros\u00e9 and love the meaning behind OTG (it is legit wonderful). Gone is my fav of the two songs, but I still vibe to both.\n\nThat particular line is just an off note for me in the song. As you said, she explains it in the Zach Sang interview and says how she had \"a crack in her wall\" in her house in Australia from the boiler, but it's even clear in that interview that the line is more of a metaphor to describe how far she's come. \n\nThe line \"hole in the wall with a mattress,\" is evocative, and I guess I think it's a stretch too far. When I think \"[Hole in the wall,](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hole%20in%20the%20wall)\" I think of really tiny and crappy apartment, not a crack in the wall. It sort of gives off this false sense of poverty, which is just not the case. \n\nI appreciate that she was using it as a metaphor and totally get that it doesn't have to exactly match her life. Some of the other metaphors in the song really landed for me. This one didn't.",

I'd also like to point out that idols don't just come from SM, YG, and JYP.  \n\nThere are a lot of agencies trying to capitalize on the Hallyu Wave by pushing groups out without the resources of a bigger agency.  \n\nI highly doubt that Brave Girl's and EXID prior to their resurgence were raking in the dough.    \nHELL! My fuckin girls AoA could be seen how bad they were struggling in the beginning. It might be incredibly difficult to find, but there's a series called Cheongdamndong 111 following FNC artists around. Watch Jimin pull out her royalties for Moya.   \n\nAlso not to mention Rainia and that clusterfuck of a group (not the idols, the management, obviously).  \n\nNow to the why:  \n\nIf you talk to older kpop fans, who've watched their idols struggle initially, older fans who were floored to find out about the slave contracts their idols went through, it makes sense why we'd associate like that. It's literally the historical trends of these companies.  \n\nI don't know the split of KPOP fans these days between older fans and the newer teeny boppers. I'm an older kpop fan but I can tell the difference between SNSD Goes to School and ITZY on Master in the House. Like it's obvious to me. But there's a lot of older kpop fans who dropped off actively supporting kpop cuz their bias groups disbanded or they just outgrew it, who probably still cling to those ideas.",

Instead they have been supporting him throughout all the years, while he was a trainee. Kids came visit his family in Australia and they have a big and nice house. Seeing Minho's vlogs I'd say his family is somewhere around middle class, but if you watch his mentality he is very humble and I believe that's how he was raised, so his family might be actually well off in reality, because they just don't care about materialistic stuff. Changbin is from a rich family, yes. They even have a chandelier in the living room and other members make fun of him because he's rich lol. When it comes to Jisung, I'd say his family is well off. His dad bought him expensive Rolex watch quite recently, which Han said he couldn't buy himself, because they're too expensive. Seungmin seems from a middle class family, Hyunjin probably from a bit richer than that. Felix's family is probably in a good financial situation as well seeing his clothes and things from predebut. When it comes to Jeongin, I got no clue as he's from Busan and I don't think he ever showed his house or anything. But I know his parents are very supportive and proud of him haha",

I can neither confirm or deny this and I'm very curious what you've based this off of.\n\nThat aside though, while it is true a number of idols have been financially successful, we're talking about a tiny percentage here. Certainly 1% at best.\n\nI don't personally consider this to be \"plenty\", but I'll respect other opinions.\n\nPersonally I think it is a harsh world to be a part of, made worse by the fact that only a sliver of those in it are able to reach any sort of success. Trainees and idols give up a lot for this, you know? Of course it's usually their own decision, but still. I absolutely share a sentiment for poor idols in that sense. \n\nNow if we're taking literally in terms of how much money they have or receive, I haven't seen groups being portrayed as poor per s\u00e9. Except sometimes in YouTube comments... but those tend to get rather delusional. There's tons of people there who call themselves an idol's biggest fan, yet post lies about, and act rude towards their idol. But I digress.\n\nThe truth is, idols have and are giving up a lot to pursue their dreams, and almost none of them reach enough success to earn a notable amount of money from it.",

People focus so heavily on the top tier groups that people see, but there are so many groups that exist that people have never even heard of because they don't survive very long.\n\nIt really doesn't matter if they come from wealth or not, its their *family's* money, not theirs. They are children, its not like they had any say in earning that money.\n\nAlso the vast majority of idols are not rich, you're looking at the top 1%. Yes idols like BTS, BP, RV, TWICE, EXO, and SVT are rich but they are pretty much the absolute peak of kpop. For each one of those groups, there are *dozens* who aren't worth anywhere near that.",

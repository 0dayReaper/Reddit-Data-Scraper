    "postText": "If anybody doesn't know yet, the agency is accused of being funded by a cult and some members and employees are said to also be a part of it.\n\nThe members were put on a social media ban but the company is still uploading YouTube content. A fan asked them via email if the accusations were true and they just replied that they aren't and the groups activities will continue. On Friday is their debut anniversary which means they are doing a livestream and fans will be asking questions about this. This whole situation gives me goosebumps. If the police are investigating about this wouldn't the agency stop their activities?",

The members seem to be active on Weverse DM (which I didn't purchase, but people who have, say this) and there are going some posts around where the company denied everything but we don't have an official statement, so I take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI truly hope they can overcome this, they're one of my ult groups. And as much as this situation hurts me, it most likely hurts them way more.",

Cults are huge deals, especially in Korea, so if the investigation proves the cult thing true it\u2019s over for them. If by magic the company doesn\u2019t shut down then they just won\u2019t have any domestic support. \n\nA member of DKZ recently got revealed to being part of a cult, he didn\u2019t willingly join and was born into it and grew up brainwashed by the cult but even after revealing all of that a lot of knetz refuse to support him. So, imagine how it\u2019s gonna be in E\u2019Last case with the company willingly accepting the funding and with staff and members being part of it. \n\nObviously, just have to wait until the investigation ends but with the documentary about the cult out it\u2019s hard to see them continuing",

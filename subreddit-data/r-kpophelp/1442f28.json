            "comment": "So I've been to a few different group's concerts by now and I feel like it depends. If you're going to be far away from the stage and your lightstick is just a white light then I don't think anyone other than those around you will notice. Even correct lightsticks sometimes don't pair properly and are just white the entire time.\n\nBut if it's a specific colour, like green, then do not bring it. Also check if the organisers have put out a notice about it. Other lightsticks weren't allowed at Red Velvet's concert in Europe, they put out a notice but there was one girl who managed to sneak her neobong (nct, green) in and everyone around me was throwing shade about it. She was far away from us but I think everyone in the venue could see her lol. Don't be that person.\n\nIf you're going to be visible from the stage, I don't think you should bring another lightstick. The group should see their own lightsticks. But like I said, if you're far away and the lightstick is just white and there's no rules about it then I think it will be fine and you might just get a few looks from people around you.\n\nA lightstick isn't really necessary anyway. It's nice to have one but once the show starts you won't even notice that you don't have one because you'll be so focused on the stages. \n\nBut I will say it was kind of sad to be in the Red Velvet crowd the other night and there being hardly any lights because only rv lightsticks were allowed and the amount they brought sold out in 15 minutes. So that's why I feel like other lightsticks would be fine if they were neutral and not right by the stage because the crowd would have looked nicer tbh.",

If so you can bring it but there will be fans wondering why you have another group's lightstick at the concert.\n\nIts odd because merch booths sell lightsticks usually and security prefers the only LS being the ones sold(easier to keep track of).\n\nPersonally I don't care but some kpop fans don't like it.",

All the kpop concerts I\u2019ve been to I have always seen people with other light sticks and even glow sticks so they can join in on the fun. It\u2019s really not that serious lol just double check it the venue allows other light sticks, but I say take it and have fun!!",

    "postText": "Hey, so I recently realised that Seventeen\u2019s FML album\u2019s sales on Hanteo is more than Circle (by hundreds of thousands) which is kind of my first time ever seeing something like this because usually it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nI stand corrected, but my understanding is Circle chart reflects the number of albums in stock or have been pre-ordered/ordered; and Hanteo chart reflects the actual sales i.e albums which have been purchased on or off the counter.\n\nDoes that mean Seventeen sell more than what\u2019s been ordered? But how\u2019s that possible cause you need to order first before you make purchase. Or somehow someway sales are not being reported yet? But it\u2019s been over a month since their comeback and it\u2019s really weird to see their Hanteo sales still exceeding Circle. Appreciate any explanation!\n\nEdited: word replacements",

Ktown4u\u2019s notice said it\u2019ll probably be in production mid-june \ud83e\udd72",

            "comment": "If you're comparing Hanteo with Circle retail chart, it's normal not to have the same numbers as they don't necessarily have the same coverage. I think Circle retail is Korea-bases stores only ? Whereas Hanteo includes most international sales now (a few years ago it didn't so there could be a big gap between Circle album chart and Hanteo) ?\n\nCircle album chart that counts distributor shipments, hasn't been updated for may yet, so it's hard to compare.",

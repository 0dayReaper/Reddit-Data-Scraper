Not all city pop sounds just like Say Something I think though, so have a look through.\n\nI'll throw the kitchen sink of K-citypop at ya and you can figure it out, These artists are really good and it's hard not to throw their whole spotify discog at you because a lot of them clearly really care and like producing music n it shows. So honestly just go on their spotifys and listen top tracks down:\n\n* [Nahee](https://youtu.be/U3LX4j6EQIk?t=41)\n* [Choi HEART](https://youtu.be/9xxULb5Mz5Y?t=11)\n* [Kim Areum](https://youtu.be/SRumSf6ZMOg?t=32)\n* [Yukika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67jSYCSrnE4&amp;ab_channel=1theK%28%EC%9B%90%EB%8D%94%EC%BC%80%EC%9D%B4%29)\n* [Rainbow Note](https://youtu.be/HoUhLdBYpI0?t=61)\n\nand much more\n\n[Spotify playlist based on these sounds](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7nUK6pM5Viwp3Ah6Ybh0ED?si=d99b4a498f214e03)",

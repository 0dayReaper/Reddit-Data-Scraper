There are just some songs you listen to and instantly just feel happier because they're upbeat, nice, maybe summer songs that you just can't get enough of. Like lyrics don't even matter, just listening to this will make your mood better kind of songs. Songs u can't help but want to dance to kinda of songs.\n\n\nHere are a few examples that I cannot get enough of:\n\nAny song by Zico\n\nFancy by Twice\n\nMy my by Seventeen\n\nCheer up by Twice\n\nSnap shoot by Seventeen\n\nWhat is love by Twice\n\n21st century girl by BTS \n\nHoliday by Seventeen\n\nThe feels by Twice\n\nDumdi dumdi by (G)i-dle\n\nFighting by BSS\n\nOh my by Seventeen\n\nTamed - dashed by Enhypen\n\nShine by Pentagon\n\nRollin by Brave Girls\n\nPretty u by Seventeen\n\nUp by Kep1er\n\nAfter school by Weeekly",

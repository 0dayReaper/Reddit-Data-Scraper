    "postText": "Next week in London there are a few kpop acts coming but I can only see tickets (minimum) x3 the FV! They sold out very quickly but I was holding out hope that someone would sell their ticket reasonably, especially so close to the events. Is there any way of attending other than paying \u00a3240+ for the worst seats? Or is it a matter of pay or miss it?",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm not new to the kpop trading community but i'm definitely new to managing group orders. I've recently just completed my first ever small-scale group order from Ktown4u, which has been pretty simple because I didn't use my K-proxy. \n\nRecently, I've been really into ZB1 (the Boys Planet group) and am trying to host group orders for their debut album. I posted a fixed claim recruitment post, but I've been having a hard time with getting traction. I don't have much of a following, and Instagram getting rid of the \"recents\" tab on hashtags has been making it difficult for my post to reach new audiences.\n\nFor reference, I'm offering benefits such as lowered EMS and raffled free DMS, which are standard for most GOMs attempting for a fansign. Are there any seasoned GOMs here who are willing to lend some wisdom on how to promote your group orders? Thank you!",

            "comment": "i mean MVs are basically the whole identity of the song/the whole comeback, ive been a kpop fan for many years now and ive rarely seen idols make a comeback without dropping an mv, especially if we're talking abt an mini album release. So that already says a lot, the music videos play a vital role in this, because theres also this whole expectation behind it from the fans or even just accasional listeners to see which concept and even dance a groups gonna come up with, besides the fact of being extremely well orchestrated majority of the time.\n\nThe perfect example for it would probably be IVEs \"Love Dive\" the song initially had a very different response from the overall public, but everybody could agree that the mv was \"perfect\" and aesthetically pleasing, personally speaking i believe it played a vital role for the song being the huge hit that it was. I guess it was also similar for NewJeans Hype Boy, the song was already a hit at first because of its innovative sounds but a lot of ppl were drawn to it after watching the mv",

Or even during the antifragile era, i guess the fact that \"Impurities\" ended up having a mv later on didnt really affect the success of the song.",

            "comment": "Releasing a MV is great promotion for a track, but I don't think there is a correct answer to this. It also depends on how well received the song was before its MV release. \nFor example Le Sserafim released a MV for both \"Impurities\" and \"Eve, Psyche &amp; the Bluebeard\u2019s wife\". Impurities didn't get much more popular after that, but \"Eve, Psyche &amp; the Bluebeard\u2019s wife\" definitely profited from a MV. After the MV release the song started charting in Korea and now it's even in the Top 10 on Melon. It has also been doing much better internationally.\nI think MV's can definitely push songs which were already loved, while other songs' popularity may or may not rise.",

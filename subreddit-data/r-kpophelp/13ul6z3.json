For eg, Inception/Halazia/Guerrilla era could barely qualify under Pirates concept. \n\nI agree that Epic anthem like songs are their signature but that's not a concept but a sound. I don't think they can be classified under these categories.\n\nWhat do you think?",

I agree with the other comment that ATEEZ has sort of a badass theatrical fantasy sound with a pirate/anarchist concept. It's hard to pin them down under a typical concept in kpop.\n\nThen they also have eras like THANXX/INCEPTION, THE REAL/TURBULENCE, ETERNAL SUNSHINE which don't fit into any of the above mentioned concepts. It's a bit hard to categorise them. \n\nMaybe a cinematic concept? would work. Another group that would fit under this concept would be BAP imo.",

            "comment": "This is just a thought! Feel free to disagree, but, I wouldn't really say Twice is consistently a \"cute concept group\" personally. I'd say they generally have more of a bright concept and rather that the members individually do have a cute charm to them (Sana in particular comes to mind), but as an overall concept I don't think categorising them as cute quite fits? Particularly with recent releases like Set Me Free, Talk That Talk, even Fancy, I would definitely not call them cute concepts, the way I understand the term. I'd consider tracks like Me Gustas Tu by GFriend and Mr Chu by Apink (as well as many of their other early songs) to be what I think of when I hear cute concept~ But to be fair I don't really think Twice's concepts are particularly easy to group together overall anyway? Even their debut and early eras like Like Ooh-Ahh and Cheer Up feel more like... youthful and bright concepts to me? But I dunno, as a Once I feel like like Twice has never really been a Cute Concept\u2122 group. The only title song of theirs that stands out as more of a cute concept song is Knock Knock, I think! \n\nOh gosh I wrote so much more than I expected, I'm curious more people's thoughts on this now haha",

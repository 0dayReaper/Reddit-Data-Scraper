I really like the way that albums aren\u2019t just CDs there also collectors items with the photo books and inclusions. I think it would be fun to collect albums from my favorite non-kpop artists.",

Way, way better than performing once or twice for a daytime/evening show crowd that has never heard the song before and is at best vaguely supportive. Unfortunately American fanbases are really spread out geographically, and few artists have a fanbase that would bother showing up at odd hours for a single performance.",

It really was the closest we had to the music shows in Korea.  I'm at the age where I watched TRL when it was in it's prime and I always liked how the studio audience was made up of fans of the music vs the talk shows where you MIGHT have 20% of the audience have an idea who the artist is, if you're lucky.   \n\n\nThe problem now is that viewing services are so fragmented (cable tv, paramount+, youtube tv, facebook, tiktok, hulu, amazon prime, etc) it's really hard to find one way for a large audience to be able to watch. I was looking at the MTV VMA aware nominee list that came out yesterday and there was a catageory for something like best meta performance that kinda shows how fragmented the places to perform are.",

Give the artist a break from performing on stage but also a chance to meet a lot of fans.",

You could usually buy merch there too. And at the end the artist would sing a song or two for fans.\n\nSelena Gomez, One Direction, Justin Bieber, a handful of Disney singers did things like this.",

            "comment": "The consistent creation of content.  People are wondering why KPop fans are so loyal and rabid and it's because of the constant content that KPop artists put out.  Vlives, a weekly YouTube reality show, show guestings, IG &amp; TikTok posts, Cross-Artist Collab posts, 5 versions of MVs, etc... A fan of an artist will never run out of content for their favorite artists and it makes them fall in love with them even more.  Western artists do IG, sometimes.  A song every few months.  A talk show appearance for a few minutes.  That's about it.  It's hard to build a loyalty to someone who feels so distant.",

You rarely see that with Western artists though.\n\nMultiple songs a year.

It's more the general idea that Western artists should not see participation in a game show or variety show or something like that as being washed-up but more as a chance to showcase themselves in a different way.\n\nK-pop haters always like to say that k-pop idols feel fake and manufactured giving the trainee system and everything but, if you think about it, Western artists curate their image even more than idols do and will try so hard to protect it that they truly feel inaccessible.

            "comment": "Behavior and courtesy. So many western artists are disrespectful and rude to their own fans. Like JB spitting on his fans, Meek Mill trying to charge fans to take pictures when they ran into him on the street, Chris Brown punching that one fan for accidentally photobombing his picture, Kanye insisting that a fan in a wheelchair STAND during his concert, the list goes on and on. Not to mention how pretty much every concert and event that has western celebs in it, the celeb is ALWAYS late. It's the norm for concerts to start 30+ minutes late regularly. It's so disrespectful to fans who spend their hard-earned money to buy tickets to see them perform imo. Or how many concerts and events celebs show up high or drunk. Or don't play the full setlist. Or leave early, or just don't put any effort or energy into performing. Of course, I don't believe that western artists should be as controlled as Korean ones, but there is a base level of respect that's just not being met.\n\nWhile I do like how Western Celebs have more freedom, a lot of them are just gross and messy people, and some of these people just need to improve their behavior in public.\n\nI also think in general kpop artists are more grateful for their fans. The reality is that without a dedicated fanbase, even the most talented people can't really make it that far. But western artists are often pushing the \"self made, all by myself\" angle, without really acknowledging just how big of a role their fans play in their success.",

Once Summer Girls came out they went a different direction in their music away from rapping mostly alas.  \n\n\nStarting around the early 2000's it became more and more common to just have a guest rap artist on a track vs having a group member who could rap. I'm not sure if that was because the groups were being formed to concentrate more on vocals/dancing/visuals, if the labels just didn't find rapping an important talent to scout or develop, or if the labels game plan was to continue trying to increase profits by selling to both fans of the pop group and the rap artist.",

I know the death of an album is to blame for it, but like other comments mentioned if there was effort put into albums to make them merch/collectibles it could be revived. \nThere was a bit of a move made in terms of vinyls recently, with exclusive colors, design.

It feels like some after reaching a certain level just fall off the face of the earth at times then just pop back in out of nowhere like they haven't been gone.  KPop groups get pretty busy even to the point of being too much but at least they're out there.  It's nice to know that they're always there.\n\nAnother thing that adds to that is accessibility to that artist and building that connection.  With KPop artists they feel like they're right there waiting.  VLives and streaming are such valuable tools that we kind of take for granted now given how prevalent they are. \nThose little things where you get a piece of their time really goes a long way.  It feels really tacky and clich\u00e9 to say but really helps build a strong bond for both sides.  It just feels more satisfying and rewarding to follow KPop artists than more western artists.",

Like Bangchan from Stray Kids before the tour was basically doing Lives every week despite how absolutely busy they are.  I sometimes take for granted how grueling KPop can be at times to constantly put out content.\n\nIf I were to change it I guess marketing strategy and build up.  Kendrick Lamar basically dropped Mr. Moral and the Big Steppers out of nowhere to me.  Again I kind of live under a rock right now when it comes to western music I don't remember if there was a push for the album.  From my perspective, it was no promos leading up to the release, no big promos after, not even TV appearances to get it out there.  He dropped the album and I think he basically went straight into the tour.\n\nI still stand by wishing western artists were more accessible.  A simple stream where they just stop by and chat it up a bit would do wonders in building a strong stable fanbase.  It just feels so cool that they could be right there ready for you to possibly talk to.  Post a fun comment or question and there's a chance they'll acknowledge it.  How awesome is that?  There's also that feeling of being appreciated that they're taking time out of their busy schedules to chat with you.  That just feels awesome.",

Kpop system is very similar to becoming a pro baseball player. You are a good baseball player, you get signed, play in minor leagues, and if you're really good, you get moved up to major leagues. Similarly, aspiring idols train in dance and singing, and if they're good they get signed to become a trainee, and if they thrive as a trainee, maybe they'll make their debut on an official team. \n\nIt's a very Asian way of doing things in that it's really all about pure skill. Not that I dislike the western style, but a lot of stars here get by on swagger. Are they the best dancers? Not really. Best singers? Sometimes? Even the best rapper? Sometimes but not always. But they have the most charisma and star power. That's interesting, too. I like how different the scenes are. And I love it when stars from these different worlds appreciate each other. I think kpop stars often wish they could make idiosyncratic, deeply personal songs and just vibe out on stage to them the way western artists do sometimes. And I like it when American rap and pop stars who just sort of vibe out on stage appreciate the sheer showmanship, skills, and polish of Kpop groups. They often represent the opposite ends of the spectrum but are both completely legitimate paradigms.",

It makes content much more fun because they can play off of each other, and the music can be more interesting when you have a wider range of styles and vocal ranges.\n\nKpop artists also tend to consistently have better technique than western artists, due to training periods.",

Personally i can't imagine getting a photobook of kdot with his cd.\n\nI think it would dope for \"comebacks\" to be a thing though like premieres and shit are a big deal. Some artists just drop out of nowhere with no buildup and it's a hit or miss on reception sometimes",

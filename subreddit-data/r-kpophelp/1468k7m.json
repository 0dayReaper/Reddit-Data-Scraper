So, what ways do you use to remember specific songs if the night, other than filming? \n\nPersonally, I find filming actually makes it impossible to watch the concert, because then I'm distracted from checking if my recording hand is slipping down too far.",

I don't find it shameful to \"take notes\" from tweeted tracklists or recordings provided by other fans \ud83d\ude02 Instead, I focus more on jotting down the *other* minute details that were not captured in the video clips, eg. what sort of banter went on during the artists' convos, any changes they added to certain songs (eg. rewritten verses, guest acts that were not originally featured on certain songs, changed instrumentals), any creative or hilarious placards/posters you saw from the audience. I'll always be proud of myself for writing down every single detail of one particular concert I went back in 2015 - I went both days of the gig and it happened to be the first ever concert where a K-pop singer implemented a 360\u00b0 rotating stage, so I had a lot of amusing aspects to review on (both good and bad). The tracklist and details I left on my blog also became a source for me to refer to whenever a newbie fan inquired whether the said artist performed certain B-sides!\n\nAs a Korean, I abide by the no-filming rules and only take out my phone when the artists or staff give us a few minutes to take photos/videos. So I guess I was more \"trained\" to memorize as many details as possible throughout the years, lol. Don't worry about not remembering the show. Go home, don't do anything too distracting, and take some rest. It will slowly come back to you - some of the most random details strike you in the back of your brain at the least expected times!",

If so, is it true that artists \"come to you\" so to speak, whether climbing stairs for small theaters, or coming around in carts for large arenas?",

In large-scale arenas like Olympic Park, the artists may get \"closer\" to the audience as they get carried around the 2nd floor in cranes or walk around the edges of the thrust stage. They will be close enough for you to see them more clearly, but not enough to exchange high-fives or chuck them gifts. Walking through the pathways is more common among small venues, eg. theaters, but you do need a LOT of personal space and mutual repsect to do it. Bodyguards are nearby to clear the way as they approach the audience, and I've actually seen a few getting shoved to their seats when they tried to hug the artist or grab their hands.",

Although, NCT Dream surprised me by having two encores during the Dream Show 2.",

But, I had my friend (who came) record and just send it later. You should recording if your interact with the members or are in the front. I'm hoping to do this for ENHYPEN's concert.",

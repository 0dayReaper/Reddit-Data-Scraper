They usually have 3 versions with different photo books and for those, I am starting to collect one of each. If they had more than 3, I would stop, but 3 isn't too bad for my absolute favs. Otherwise I just go for the nicest version or my fav version for the handful of other groups I'm really into.",

            "comment": "Personally, I started my collection like this -&gt;\n\n- Choose Bias\n- Focus solely on Korean Box Album Releases (Skipping out on Japan Only releases, jewel cases, digi packs, etc.)\n- Find a template of your bias by era, and choose to either work your way from oldest to newest, or newest to oldest\n- Focus only on Album Photocards (no preorder benefits from With.Mu.U, JYPShop, Etc.)\n\nYou can then work your way outwards when you feel ready.\n\nFor example, I bias Dahyun from Twice. I organize my binder by era, and focus on collecting the official album photocards first. Because Twice has official Pre-Order Benefits in most albums (and they\u2019re readily available online), I typically buy those as well, since they are on theme with the photocards. \n\nOnce I\u2019ve collected all the official album PC\u2019s I then focus on album inclusions (like posters, postcards, message cards, polaroids, film strips, etc. most template creators will have templates for these items as well). But if you aren\u2019t interested in those, or your group doesn\u2019t focus on them much, you can skip this.\n\nI then move onto exclusive PC\u2019s like ones from Target, Barnes and Noble, and Walmart, and start with shop pre-order benefits like With.Mu.U and MyMusicTaste.\n\nThen I move onto concert sets, and finally product photocards (like the Twice x Lemona collab, or Stray Kids x Nacific)\n\nSome Advice: Sometimes it\u2019s not worth it to buy an entire new album just for the chance to pull a specific card. If you have all album versions, It just becomes too expensive to buy a $17-26 album for a $7 photocard. Just buy the photocard on instagram or mercari (or carousell/shopee depending on where you\u2019re from)",

I even skip japanese releases for now.\n\nAlso, you don't have to collect everything, kpop collectors community really pushes the completionist route, but it's really ok to just collect certain things. Whether it's certain albums, photocards, etc. up to you.\n\nEnjoy it, and don't stress over it too much! It's a hobby, it should be enjoyable~\n\nGood luck with your collection!",

My collection isn't complete yet because some albums are now hard to get. \n\nThe DVDs. They are a very painful thing to collect, they're expensive and for some reason they are always sold out. So i asked a few local retailers for them. \n\nThe photocards are a bloodbath tho \ud83d\ude42. I remember there was this pc that i wanted and it was on sale for 83$ lol. So if you're new to collecting. \nNEVER EVER BUY A PC from someone whom you don't know and seems suspicious and always do research and review checks. \n\nI don't have a lightstick yet cuz I haven't been to their concert yet so I just wanna get more things like merches before getting a lightstick \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Then I worked out what version I actually wanted (this is the hardest part, I'd buy them all but I gotta eat) and started hunting them down on the internet.\n\nFor out of print releases, there'll be 2nd hand sellers, but the albums will be dented or missing photocards. You need to compare condition of album vs price. In my case, I've given up on finding a complete \"perfect\" album including all the cards/poster/stickers. Its too expensive.\n\nMost of the time, the inclusions are sold separately from the album. So you have to decide if you want to collect the photocards/other stuff too. Then you go off and hunt those down. \n\nHappy hunting and remember to save some cash for food lol. Kpop merch come in a million versions and a billion photocards so you should not try to collect everything unless you have a million dollars.",

For a while that was exclusively BTS, and only newer albums, so I did that. Eventually I moved to a place with a Koreatown and the availability of albums was much more diverse and I had to pick and choose what I wanted to collect. I started with groups I was interested in and if they were having a comeback, started with those, and then worked my way back. I\u2019m not an online ordering kinda person, and tbh I think that would have made it way harder because obviously ordering online still has way more variety than an in person store.\n\nI guess my best advice, more than where to start or what to collect first is just\u2026take your time. I think it\u2019s really easy to get caught up in seeing others collections and wanting to get there and have shelves full of beautiful albums and every addition of every album ever made by your ults but like\u2026chill out. Someone on tiktok gave me the same advice and I thought I was listening but I own 170 albums after collecting for a little over two years, and while I\u2019m proud of my collection\u2026.it\u2019s a lot\u2026. And it\u2019s a lot of money, and it\u2019s a lot of space and it\u2019s a lot to move. It can be a very, very slippery slope, so it\u2019s okay to breath and cherish your collection when it\u2019s small and treat every album special.",

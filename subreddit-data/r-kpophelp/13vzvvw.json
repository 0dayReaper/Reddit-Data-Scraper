    "postText": "Okay, so the song has been stuck in my head, but it\u2019s not really the song it\u2019s the one lyric. I know it\u2019s a male singing it, and it\u2019s sounds like a rap in my head. The lyric is \u201cladies and gentlemen.\u201d I know there are endless possibilities. I know it is 100% not the \u201cladies and gentleman\u201d from BTS\u2019s Dynamite, but I feel like I sounded like BM from Kard. It has been stuck in my head, and it\u2019s becoming an ear worm. I just need to hear it so I can get it out of my head\ud83d\ude2d please",

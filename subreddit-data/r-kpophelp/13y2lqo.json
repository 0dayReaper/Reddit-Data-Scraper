            "comment": "I've only seen Twice and GOT7 for group concerts so my experience is limited. But I've found that the crowd at Twice was a lot more orderly and the crowd at GOT7 got really wild, mainly because of how they interacted with us especially during the encore. Both were really high energy all the way through though.\n\nThere's also more male fans at GG than BG concerts so the intensity and pitch of the cheering is different. I would also think it depends on which group you're seeing too. I'm going to Mamamoo tomorrow and I'm expecting it to be lively but not crazy.\n\nSo jealous you're seeing Red Velvet! I've been waiting for them to announce their U.S. tour \ud83d\ude2d",

Back in the day (pre-BP I should say), fans of YG groups were more chill, less rowdy. \n\n~~(I'm terribly spoiled by Japanese concert crowds so I now get annoyed by excessive cheering ahahaha.)~~\n\nI think the biggest difference will be the amount of fanboys. Or \"uncle fans\". I remember when I saw Red Velvet at KCON, I honestly had more fun watching the fanboys in the crowd dancing perfectly to the choreo hahaha. My friend was weirded out when she went to the Momoland showcase at another KCON... it was full of uncle fans and the vibe was just... wrong.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve seen Stray Kids and Dreamcatcher in concert and the only difference I noticed that could be related to the gender of the performers was that there were more men at the Dreamcatcher concert and there were more women at the Stray Kids concert.\n\nHowever there were a lot of differences related to the specific groups I saw. For example the people at the Stray Kids concert were much younger than the people at the Dreamcatcher concert. The venue for the Stray Kids concert was much bigger since they had a stadium while Dreamcatcher had a theater. There were people barking at both concerts and both crowds were extremely energetic.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think it matters whether you\u2019re seeing a gg or a bg it more matters what kind of fan base they have.",

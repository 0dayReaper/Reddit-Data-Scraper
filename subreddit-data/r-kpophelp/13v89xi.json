Her first favorite song was Maniac, and now it's Cheese, but she's gained a whole playlist of songs she loves by now. I just love to see which songs she responds to! \n\nWhat about your kids? How do they react to your love of Kpop? Do they have their own favorites?",

My 11yo says he likes listening to Lone Ranger by Monsta X. Looked up the English lyrics to this so not sure how I feel about that... \n\nPart of the reason I like kpop is that I can enjoy the sounds, beats and voices without understanding the lyrics.",

I got so tired of feeling brain-dead listening to the same old English pop songs regurgitated over and over. When I was reintroduced to Kpop, I felt like a layer had been lifted from between me and the music. It was raw and emotional again: I felt like (and still do) I connected directly to the music at the heart level, bypassing the brain by all together. And I love it. \n\nPlus, it feeds my inner 13-year-old hipster who loved listening to obscure music. \n\nThere are many reasons why I love it, but I had to comment when you said you like not understanding it- I don't think I've ever seen anyone use this reason before. It made me happy since I also feel this way!",

I was 8 years old at the time (in 2010) and have always wanted to pursue a career in medicine, so after they told me about the show, I decided to watch it with them. Fast forward to a couple months later, in autumn, me and my mom started watching KBS World as they had a contract with our TV provider and we had the channel easily available. Watched a couple more dramas and then eventually also started watching Music Bank. \n\nWe discovered JYJ and TVXQ first because PYC was in Sungkyunkwan Scandal and we thought he was a great actor. We did a bit of googling and found out about his past in DBSK and his musical career. My mom went on to be a VERY loyal JYJ fan for years afterwards, while also being interested in other Kpop groups (mostly second gen). I however liked being a multi-stan more, so I was into a lot of fandoms. \n\n2nd gen Kpop is probably my favorite, along with early 3rd gen. I follow plenty of groups, but after a bit of a \"break\" in highschool, I now have a much healthier relationship with the music genre and truly stan only BTS, SKZ and ATEEZ, while also keeping an eye on other groups I like. Never forgot about DB5K either \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nAnd yes, I am currently studying medicine in uni. \n\nP.S.: I have a younger brother who was born when I was 7. He quite LITERALLY grew up hearing Kpop all around him (more than I did lol). He is not a fan, but he likes a couple of songs :) and he was interested in B.A.P. back when I was like... 12? 13? and he was... 5 \ud83e\udd79 6 years old.",

I'm STAY as well (they're my ult)  and my 2.5 year old loves quite a few of their songs, like I said up top Cheese is her favorite and she goes \"cheese,  yeah yeah yeah cheese\" and I'm just loving it. I've mostly listened to kpop since she turned one, and I'm wondering if, in part, it's why she's learning to talk a little late. \n\nBut because she doesn't talk much yet, it means even more to me that these songs get her talking. She does the beginning of Bad Decisions, and the chorus a bit. I can't usually figure out what she's singing until she says \"OOH BABY... MONDY TUSDY WESDY.\" LOL. She loves That That and Hello by Treasure- she goes nuts for this song and starts jumping all over the place.\n\nI think my daughter also stans JK from BTS, lol. Left and Right by Charlie Puth and JK, Run BTS Dance practice, and the opening of Dynamite are some of her favorite videos to watch lol. It's so cute. She's got good taste though \ud83d\udc4c",

His younger sister (now a high school freshman) seems to be into SKZ, and when they attended a LOONA performed at a local concert last year, I lent her my LOONA lightstick (her brother already had one).\n\nMy nephew is into Twice (I think the weirdest part of being two fans that are in different actual generations is that we have the same bias), and he\u2019s also into Mamamoo (his birthday is next month, and I\u2019ve already ordered the latest Mamamoo+ album for his present).",

I recently took her to a\nTXT concert last weekend. She has gotten my nephew into a few kpop songs. His mom told me she caught him singing Lisa's Money.\n\nMy cousin told me she got into kpop because of me but I don't actually remember showing it to her. I assume she's telling the truth though lol. Her favorite groups are BTS and Twice which she got into during the pandemic, but she likes lots of groups. She also traveled down to see TXT with me.",

And she didn\u2019t care for the Kpop. But then aespa\u2019s next level came up. And it was like my niece was possessed. She immediately caught up on the back vocals/chorus, and so on. And the dance. Obv, she was uncoordinated. \n\n\nNow, \nWhen it comes to Kpop, she only enjoys girl group music. ESP if it has a lot of catchy lines spread throughout the song. It\u2019s kinda funny. Bc of her, I\u2019m paying more attention to gg music. \n\nShe LOVES Aespa and New Jean\u2019s songs the most. \n\nI think aespa is her #1. She sings savage with such an attitude. \n\nShe is south Asian and doesn\u2019t speak Korean so she catches onto whatever she can lmao.\n\nObv, she is also into Disney music and she LOVES Afromusic too.",

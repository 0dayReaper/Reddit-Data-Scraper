Ig they add subs to the most popular ones..",

The fact that there are also non-english speaking fans watching doesn't change any of that, nor does it somehow require the production company to do something different.\n\nJust like how many groups release some content just for the Japanese audience, not everything is designed for and marketed toward everyone.",

Of course it's ridiculous to expect any given Korean person to just start spouting off in English for your comfort, and that doesn't change when the Korean person in question is famous; but subtitles are an entirely different matter and can be done by a professional who is known to speak both languages and specifically there to make access easier for people around the globe.\n\nNow, whether it's *worthwhile* for Dingo to pay translators for all their Killing Voice videos is a separate question. They certainly don't have to do so if they don't feel that the demand exceeds the cost of hiring a translator. But in any event, asking a corporation for subs is entirely different to harassing an individual person to start speaking your language even after they've asked you to stop.",

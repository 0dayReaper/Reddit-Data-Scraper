    "postText": "Even though they debuted with Lil Touch, nothing else really came out since then. There was Melody in 2021 but that's not a comeback. What are even Yuri, Yoona and Sunny doing in SM? Taeyeon and Hyoyeon are soloists but Yuri and Yoona only debuted solo and no comebacks, and Sunny didn't debut at all. Does SM even have any plans with them?",

Yuri and Yoona both have very successful acting/modeling careers that take priority for them, and Sunny seems to be focused on having a quiet life and doing low key projects when she feels like it. (And has talked in pat interviews about her insecurities with her voice)",

Just like they did in Melody. It couldn't be SNSD, cause three of them were not under SM, so it was OH GG. Same thing with the season greetings. So the do not need to comeback, just need to exist.",

            "comment": "For many of them, music might no be the main focus. For someone like Taeyeon, who is known for her powerful vocals, continuing to release music is an obvious choice. For Yoona, her visuals are key and she's been criticised for weak vocals before, so acting/CF/modelling/photoshoots is more her thing now (she has a drama coming out soon). I don't keep close enough track of the girls, so no idea what the others are doing. \n\nSometimes, you will stick in the same place until you find something better. Perhaps they haven't found a better agency yet (one that gives them a decent contract).",

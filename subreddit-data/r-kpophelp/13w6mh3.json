Just groups that have a fresh concept and made a debut less than a year ago, please.\n\nIt's fine if they're nugu as long as they perform in music shows. The more aegyo there is in the performance, the better.",

They just debuted with [Cherry Talk](https://youtu.be/eSyYASPBj8c) a few weeks ago.\n\ntripleS itself is also new and debuted 7-ish months ago with the unit Acid Angel from Asia, but Krystal Eyes is the only cute concept unit right now.\n\nSome other new groups:\n\n2023 debut: Adya, BoyNextDoor, Limelight\n\nLater 2022: CSR (also cute concept), NewJeans, Fifty Fifty\n\nSome M Countdown links:\n\nAdya - [Per](https://youtu.be/FiUG3eovkrI)\n\nBoyNextDoor - [One &amp; Only](https://youtu.be/QsjL-Z73QKg)\n\nLimelight - [Honestly](https://youtu.be/uffplKZX4hE)\n\nCSR - [Shining Bright](https://youtu.be/IJJT2J0_U_Y)\n\nNewJeans - [OMG](https://youtu.be/yKItFB_HPhE) (This is a Music Bank performance cause they didn't promote it on MC)\n\nFifty Fifty - [Cupid](https://youtu.be/ivYva9jYaUw)",

[Loveticon](https://youtu.be/G9OR9vlJMxE) is my current favorite by them but [Shining Bright](https://youtu.be/-sO2FlFMQZI) is their most recent. \n\nILY:1 is another girl group I really love, with [Que Sera Sera](https://youtu.be/DK0iFnnQ1ig) being my favorite. They're more nugu but they still do music shows for comebacks. \n\nYounite is kind of a weird case because they debuted really cute, went noisy 4th gen boy group, and then went back to cute (which I'm hoping they stick with longer this time lol) but I really love both releases so I wanted to include them: [1 of 9](https://youtu.be/6uuSfftCr1g) (debut), [Waterfall](https://youtu.be/6wENO5w-oQw) (most recent).",

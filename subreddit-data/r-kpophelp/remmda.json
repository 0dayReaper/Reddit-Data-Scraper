They're basically glorified concerts and only fans of the acts nominated for anything actually care about the awards. Especially in K-pop, if the performances aren't interesting then what makes it different from your average music show lol",

It needed that traditional Korean infusion you know?",

The discrepancy was huge, some exceptions aside. If almost none of the winners perform and the top groups don't attend, why should the fans even care.",

Like the 4th gen showing truly explosive stages from one group to the other, leavin everyone in awe, and kinda saying 3rd gen, we're here to take the reigns now, you can enjoy your legacies... It could have been like a signal of the change of times or a baton being passed from our very much loved 3rd gen. It was a really missed opportunity i guess. Since most groups didn't put in that much effort. Imagine if the stage qualities and efforts were more or less like ITZY's.

First of all, comparing extremely influential multi-millionaires like BTS who is the biggest group in the world rn to rookies is idiotic, to say the least. Of course the former is gonna present the most innovative, grant and elaborate stages. Anything else would fall flat in comparison. ITZY and SKZ aren't rookies anymore. They've been in the industry for more than 2 years and they're from a BIG 3 company. These two factors explain the immense amount of quality their performances had. Then comes the actual rookies. ITZY's first MAMA stage too wasn't nearly as legendary as their latest MAMA stage, was it? Enhypen's latest MAMA stage was relatively way greater in terms of quality while compared to their first one. So give these newer groups some time to grow. Cut them some slack. Stop comparing their abilities and quality with that of established legends. Even the \"legends\" took years to reach where they are now.\n\n&gt; it's the one time of the year that all the groups can go all out on a global scale and they don't??\n\nThe scale is obviously gonna vary from group to group. Many factors like the amount of time they've spent in the industry, which companies they belong to, MAMA's level of competence etc. come to play. Do keep that in mind. You people are feeling that MAMA stages didn't go all out this year because big groups were absent. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I don\u2019t think it has to do anything with bts winning the daesangs since in the past many other groups have won many of them ie. Big Bang and exo. It might\u2019ve been repetitive and anticlimactic but you can\u2019t blame bts with how well they\u2019re doing both domestically and internationally, if anything if they hadn\u2019t won then there most likely would\u2019ve been an uproar.\n\nImo there were other factors with it\n1. Older kpop stans tired of the mistreatment of MAMA with their favs in the past. A lot of my moots that stan 2nd and 3rd gen groups stopped watching long ago because of how bad MAMA treated their favs so they didn\u2019t even bother to watch this year\u2019s for their fav 4th gen groups until the performances were posted because they didn\u2019t want to give MAMA the streams.\n2. The nominations. Some were questionable like Ateez and Loona not being nominated for best dance performance. If none of your favs aren\u2019t nominated or performing then you wouldn\u2019t want to tune in to watch.\n3. The camerawork was awful. Txt\u2019s performance was great nonetheless but whoever was in charge of the camerawork did a terrible job to the point that txt\u2019s choreographers and dancers were even upset and posted about it on sns, then they even posted the dance practice much earlier compared to other dance practices.\n4. The group collab? Used the question mark because when the news confirmation came out it seemed like it would be a dance collab similar to seventeen, gfriend, twice and got7 stage for sbs but instead it was just each idol with their own solo stage not really a \u201ccollab\u201d \n\nI think MAMA has lost a lot of it\u2019s credibility in the past with the awards already and continue to do so. Like aespa winning best dance performance, no hate to the girls because they did well but compared to itzy they have little stage presence. Not to mention when you compare itzy\u2019s mafia in the morning stage to aespa\u2019s next level stage it has you questioning how did itzy not win",

The line up wasn't well liked since the beginning (lot of posts about that), not for the artists but for the almost absolute lack of old artists of 2nd/3rd gen... And the performances of the ones performing didn't do any favor except some names... \n\nI mean yea I can be happy about Twice and the cute clip of them being happy in from of TV was shared among once but there isn't much to talk about if there isn't a performance...

MAMA used to be a VERY thrilling, distinguished show but yeah it's not that impressive anymore.\n\n Also I saw that TIKTOK was the funder  for this year's show which I found strange and disappointing. The budget did indeed seem quite low as the performances weren't like they use to be. The standard definitely went down for the stages. \n\nLike someone else mentioned - the lineup was incredibly disappointing to a lot of people as it was mostly just 4th gen groups, despite the plethora of 3rd gen groups and a few 2nd gen idols who had comebacks this year. \n\nOn the part about the awards, most fans generally only care about the performances though the artists seem to be happy about the awards. But yeah this year, though a lot of people don't like to hear it, people were certainly turned off that so much was given to BTS for the 3rd time. It was so expected people didn't even bother to care about this year's MAMA. That was definitely a factor- at least on the International spectrum of fandom.\n\nAnd another point as others have mentioned people generally seem to like the Gayo's more.\n\nWanna One had a great performance to me though and they really brought the energy that was missing even though the stage wasn't super special, they themselves had enough charisma to make it work. Which I think says a lot to 4th Gen.",

Twice won Best GG but aside from that I already knew everything would go to BTS and I honestly could care less about the awards now. BTS absolutely deserve their awards but the lack of excitement for the show itself definitely showed. I saw people saying MAMA peaked in 2019. \n\nYes, fans actually said an **AWARD SHOW peaked** 2 years ago. But to be fair, I think the restrictions is the reason it was so bland and seemingly passed by. And in all honesty even some performances were like \u2018meh\u2019 compared to last year. Man the excitement and thrill definitely wasn\u2019t there this year.",

First by having a beef with YG and now the same with Starship (Monsta X was right about not going to Kingdom). \n\nThen by ignoring every one in favor of BTS with the culmination in 2019 where they had a showcase of 30 minutes. While other artists had very restricted time. Apink was even forced off stage midperformance.\n\nLast but not least the disrespectful way they treated the idols last year by leaving them to dress and do makeup in the parking lot.\n\nI don't think there's going back on this now and many of the more established groups just bow out. The 4th gen didn't make good use of the opportunity. Maybe it's too soon for them. \n\nIt was completely underwhelming. But imo msnake completely deserves it.",

            "comment": "It has definitely gone down hill and here are the reasons that I have not been as interested in MAMA especially this year:\n\n1. **The nominations were just bad.** They seemed to be carless and have little to no thought put into them. They nominated people in categories they shouldn't have been in. For example: I ult Baekhyun but who put him in dance category. Bambi should be in categories for vocals especially since there was minimal choreo for bambi and it wasn't anything absolutely amazing. There were many other examples like that, that made no sense to me. \n2. **It is uninteresting to watch when the winner is the same every time.** Its like watching a track race that you've already seen 3 years in a row where there isn't even a competition between first and second. Its getting kind of tiring that other groups cannot be appreciated whenever BTS is in the same category. Don't get me wrong I love BTS, they work hard and love their fans and they make excellent music, but the thing is .. there are other groups that do those things and they don't get the same appreciation even when their songs may be better. BTS makes great music but these award shows are just becoming a popularity contest and aren't about the music anymore. I think that it is just getting tiring when they are guaranteed a win in any category they are in. I am not saying that BTS don't deserve any of the awards they got because of course they do, it has just gotten a little sad because we don't get to give that same appreciation to other groups who are also deserving.\n3. **The Camerawork is atrocious.** Some of the performance camerawork was ok but whoever filmed and edited TXT's Frost needs to be fired. The camerawork and lighting was absolutely awful. In the behind the scenes of them practicing for this performance the choreo looked great and like it would make an awesome performance, but when you watch the actual performance its just awful. They zoomed in and out constantly, giving me a headache and then never gave us the close up shots at the right moment. It just seemed very poorly done and that same camerawork and editing is reflected in some of the other performances.\n4. **The lack of 3rd gen or 2nd gen groups.** This is another probable reason there was less hype. Having only 4th gen groups brings in the younger fans but for the many people that only stan 3rd gen groups it would probably be disinteresting for them. I am a huge multistan so that isnt a problem for me but that could be another reason \n5. **Taemin and Ateez having no nominations.** This is a more opinionated one towards me but these are just two examples of the atrocious nominations. There were countless other groups and soloists who weren't nominated although they also had great years. First of all Taemin had TWO huge albums that came out in the timeframe to be nominated and being the best dancer in K-pop he didn't even receive a dance nomination? that just makes no sense to me. Ateez is another crazy one for me because they had a huge year dropped multiple albums that were wildly popular with crazy choreo's and didn't even get nominated for anything that they should have been nominated for. They could have been put in literally any male group category and instead they were in none.\n6. **No group interactions.** I can understand why this is not possible because of covid and there is nothing mama could have done about it but that is always one of the aspects that draws people to watch the shows. Especially the multistans. \n7. **The lack of group performances.** I understand that it may be harder to do with covid but as more and more idols are getting vaccinated this should have been able to happen. It was also just immensely disappointing this year because they promised us a collab but it was just idols from different groups dancing far away from each other.\n\nThe Wanna One reunion is the only part I don't have complaints about, it was great they could bring them back together, that was a nice touch.",

Also there was alot of collaboration stages back then that we never expected. The random idol camera shots back then weren't awkward like now, back then it was acceptable for idols to chant and dance with the performance but now most idol just sit quiet and occasionally hand gestures. \nMama was special because of the unique situation of having all of your favorite idols in one place socializing with each other. But now alot of companies boycott mama so big groups don't even attend anymore. Also the awards were kind of predictable but there was always a maybe for fans, but lately bts or exo has been winning all of the awards. Not that its bad that they win but now there's no suspense for other people.\nI think mama is just another dream concert event but with shady awards, I prefer melon music awards nowadays.",

I feel like maybe they'd need to make a daesang category that is only for 4th gen or something so these groups have a chance. Not that they'd ever actually do that but it might be nice to have an exciting \"oooooh who will win this year\" award again\n\nI was pretty disappointed bc TXT are my ults and MAMA really screwed over their performance with terrible camera work, messing up the sound and cutting off their WWFC speech. BH even posted the dance practice immediately after the show to show how the dance break was supposed to look. Frost choero is very facial expression based and they spent about 90% of the performance in wide shots or zoomed so far from the stage you couldn't even see where they were standing \n\nItzy, Enhypen and Stray Kids had the most exciting performances for me. Their concept, staging and choreo were really good. Other than that it felt a bit meh this year",

To be fair, no I don\u2019t watch MAMA either way as I didn\u2019t watch anymore around 2016 when essentially all my fave groups stopped attending afterwards. I\u2019ve seen clips and it was very underwhelming. Plus no hate to BTS, they deserve their sucess, but the fact that there\u2019s no competition also makes it very boring",

            "comment": "I don't host group orders myself but I guess it depends on what kind of orders you're trying to host since there's so many different options?\n\nThere's group orders for pobs/new releases from stores like Ktown and Makestar, there's ones from Bunjang/K-Twitter/Mercari Japan listings, and there's ones from various sources of people dropping their collections.\n\nMost of the go's I join are from Instagram goms hosting for new new releases or dropped collections so looking at posts in various kpop related tags -- like dreamcatcherwts or dreamcatchergo -- may give you a better idea of what the process looks like.",

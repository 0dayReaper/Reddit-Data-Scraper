I don't see the other members all signing to her company either.\n\nI also don't know how much of their discography they could use even if they wanted to. Like It Hot was sold off a while back, and other songs could have been as well (only looked deep into it when the MV got removed).\n\nI will be geniunely surprised if we see GWSN have another comeback.",

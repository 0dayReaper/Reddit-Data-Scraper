This preview or explanation website already went online a few years ago so it is nothing recent. I can't remember which group it was tho. I do remember that it was designed to look like a book with chapters and that the colour of the website was pretty dark if not black with golden? accents.\n\nDoes anyone remember seeing something like this too? Do you remember which kpop group this website was for? Does it still exist? Is there a URL?",

The url is www.seventeen-an-ode.com but it doesn't work anymore. This is what it looked like: [Re-Read Seventeen An Ode Album](https://youtu.be/FFMH4WBIKVc)",

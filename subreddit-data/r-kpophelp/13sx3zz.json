    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! I need help finding a song, but all I have is one tiny fragment of a lyric stuck in my head: \u201ccreate-ate-ate my reality.\u201d That might not me totally right; the part that feels most correct is the create-ate-ate part. The sound of the song is pretty noisy. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that this isn\u2019t even a kpop song, but I thiiiink it is. Almost definitely a male soloist or a boy group \u2014 I thought it was a Stray Kids or Ateez song but I quickly combed the ones I know and none of them sounded right and I didn\u2019t see the lyric. Googling didn\u2019t help either.\n\nIt\u2019s ALSO possible that this is a random tiktok song and I\u2019m totally showing my ass here, but it\u2019s been killing me so I\u2019m asking for help. \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: solved \u2014 the song is HEYDAY by Stray Kids :)",

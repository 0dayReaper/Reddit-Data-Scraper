    "postText": "Hi! It's not only my first time going to a kpop concert, but it's my first time going to any music concert in general so I had a few questions if anyone would be able to answer it would be greatly appreciated!\n\n1. I bought parking, and I was wondering what the EARLIEST possible time they will let you into the parking lot is? Or is the parking lot just open all the time and you can go whenever? I heard it will be PACKED so I want to get there as early as possible since I spent a stupid amount of $ on these tickets and don't want to stress at all lol.\n2. How do bags work? Is it just United Center policy? I wasn't going to bring a bag but is it okay to bring a water bottle in (can it be reusable, plastic, or can you not bring one in at all)? Do you normally bring anything in besides your phone/wallet? \n3. Lastly, how long do twice concerts normally last? The concert says it starts at 7:30pm but wasn't sure how long it would go and I want to stay until the very end.\n\nThank you so much for the help!",

            "comment": "Usually at the United Center parking lots open at 5pm or about 2 hours before door opens, could be different for Twice but I\u2019m not sure. You can usually find what time the lots will open on their website. The lord at the United Center can get packed but usually you\u2019re fine pulling in and out no matter what time you get there to park. \n\nLast time I was at the United Center they allowed small bags but they do search them (like the stranded 10x5 purses). They DONT allow backpacks or any large bags. From what I remember they don\u2019t allow you to bring in outside drinks. You can try to sneak a water bottle in but otherwise they\u2019ll make you throw it away.",

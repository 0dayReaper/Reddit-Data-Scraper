    "postText": "So I\u2019m doing a cover of \u201cTales of the Unusual\u201d by Pink Fantasy and I\u2019ve actually put together quite a good plan for it. However, the part I\u2019m stuck on is the chorus. I don\u2019t have fancy software, so I can only record two times to do the overlays. The intermittent \u201cgigi\u2026 goegoe\u201d during the chorus is low and not usually in the range that I do and the effective overlaps would require me singing the chorus in both takes to overlap. I\u2019m curious, would the song be incomplete without the intermittent part or would it be better to harmonize the chorus? Look up the video if you are confused.\n\nThank you!",

    "postText": "I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not even sure if this is a kpop song but I figured I would see if anybody knows it. The one lyric I remember is \u201cyou got me so excited\u201d and I\u2019m certain it\u2019s either a male group or soloist. \n\nI tend to stick to the same artists for the most part; SM groups, some BTS and BLACKPINK, Stray Kids and Twice too. (I listen to more, but I won\u2019t list them all out). Like I said in the beginning, it might not even be kpop, but at least if it isn\u2019t I can search for it somewhere else.",

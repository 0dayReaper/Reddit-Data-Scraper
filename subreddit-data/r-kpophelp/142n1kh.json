    "postText": "Hey everyone,  some friends and I  living in Korea, we noticed how tough it can be for folks abroad to shop directly here. High fees, confusing proxies, and expensive shipping costs can make it a real challenge.  \nThere are sooo many cool websites to shop for clothes, kpop merch etc that people aboard just cannot access or do not know about because its not marketed aboard. We want to help people overseas get a similar shopping experience as people living here or even just buy your kpop merch.  \nThat's why we've created this super important survey \u2013 to hear your thoughts, opinions, and any problems you've encountered. We want to know how we can make your shopping dreams come true!  \nIt'll only take 5-10 minutes to complete, and we promise your answers will remain completely anonymous. Your input is like a treasure map that will guide us in building an amazing website/app just for you.  \nIf you're interested in staying in the loop and being the first to know when we launch, let us know in the survey. We'll make sure to keep you updated on all the exciting developments.  \nThank you so much for your time and valuable input :)  \nlink to the survey: [https://forms.gle/oan3nq8MZ53ecKWa7](https://forms.gle/oan3nq8MZ53ecKWa7)",

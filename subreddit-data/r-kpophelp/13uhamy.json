    "postText": "Looking for some hidden treasures/b-sides from girl groups that are less popular. An example I can think of is Why - Kep1er. Not a fan of them particularly but I loved that song and then realized no one really listens to it lol. Please help. I\u2019m trying to get into girl groups, but I need more than title tracks. Girl groups I\u2019ve liked music from are Ive, Lovelyz, Billie, aespa, and 5050.\n\nEdit: I may or may not like your recs and I think that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not being disrespectful to you by not liking a specific song or group, no need to get upset !! :)\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve heard lesserafim and twice and I\u2019ve been a dreamcatcher fan for a couple years now, but thanks anyway! I\u2019ll be listening to the other ones in the next few days. Thank you for the underrated b-sides!",

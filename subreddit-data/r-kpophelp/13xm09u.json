So if you are only going to get one, I would go for the photobook. Circle's photobook was really big!",

            "comment": "SM is not great about elaborating on what their album versions mean/include.\n\nBased on prior releases, we can assume the SM Mini will be the tiny plastic square with the little NFC tag you can scan with your phone to get access to a digital album. It will likely come with one random PC not specific to the member you buy.\n\nDigipack is usually a standard jewel case cd-size. (Or sometimes a bit larger) cardboard compact which will have a small, short Photobook of the specific member and then again, random PC not specific to the member you buy.\n\nPhotobook will be a book of some sort, but the actual dimensions, binding, etc. are yet to be released. The site I usually buy from had three versions available listed. However, as sometimes SM releases the same Photobook just with different covers, I am waiting for more details before I order here.\n\nI don\u2019t off the top of my head remember any other SM releases recently marketed as \u201cpackage version\u201d. Sometimes they format releases that come out around the same time with similar sizes, inclusions, etc. The way it is more expensive on the sites I\u2019m seeing leads me to believe it may come with more inclusions or be a bit fancier, but we probably won\u2019t know more until very close to release date unfortunately.",

I am thinking of getting the package version, but I really want to make sure a big photo book is included.   I may wait till closer and then decide.  The photo book version has 3 versions too so I am really confused.",

                    "comment": "me too. the thing is, we probably wont be able to choose between 3 versions of photobooks (dont get me wrong i would probably like all 3 but yk) but on the package version it says that there will be only one verision. so im assumin that only one of these 3 will be in package and the rest sold in photobook version. idk what else is gonna be in pb ver. but im assuming its gonna be \"more stuff\" since its a little more expensive. istfg if theres no pb \ud83d\udd2a. tbh idk how long will i wait to preorder cuz once they start selling it (regular order) its gonna be sold out in 3 mins probably. i seriously wish they would tell us cuz we re the one paying and we dont even know what we re getting (one more bad thing about sm). speakin of this, my goddamn shipping is \u20ac30. literally more than the albim itself. ik it depends on country but damn bro. and then if i wanna order more stuff (like another album or lightstick or whatever) its even more expensive. i dont get this shiit. ik we dont gave manufacturer in eu but like does it really cost that much to ship from korea to eu. i dont think so.",

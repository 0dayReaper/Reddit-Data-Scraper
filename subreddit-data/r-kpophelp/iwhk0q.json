It\u2019s their origin story... you\u2019ll be attached in no time, and learn their names too haha link [here](https://strayksubs.com/videos/survival-show/)~\n\nAs for funny variety/reality shows: watch Finding SKZ season 1 and 2 and Dingo School. They also have around 3 or 4 guestings on Weekly Idol and 2 on Idol Room that are quite enjoyable.",

Most Ateez videos do have english subs tho.\n\nWhen it comes to learning members names, i felt like these contents helped me much more than introduction videos did, but individual member intro videos are also good. plus, a lot of them use memes and other iconic videos to help you understand the group and members better. \n\nGlad you like like both Ateez and Stray Kids! Welcome to the Atinys and Stays!",

Than watch Say My Name, Wonderland, Hala Hala, and than watch some other mvs. What really pushed me to stan them was their personalities, these boys are funny af. Whenever I try to learn a new groups name, I go to their K-profiles, pull up an mv in another tab, and than try to correlate the members (idk if that makes sense hope this helped.)",

My personal favourite: Hala Hala live performance,Wonderland, their cover of Block B at Kcon ,Black Cat by Turbo at Immortal Song,also Sicko Mode performance, MAMA 2019. Also their video performances before debut when they were KQ Fellaz.\n\nVariety: Code name Ateez, Treasure films, Kang on Box, Hello 82 Challanges,Ateez-Idol League,Ateez-BOATTA, they have some funny videos on dingo , each member has a personal project which you can find it on their Youtube Channel, also this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXVYAo4aiNw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXVYAo4aiNw)\n\nYou can also watch their Vlives.",

There are a lot of great threads where other Stays give great direction on how to get into the group!\n\nI highly recommend the reality show. It will totally endear you to the members, give you a full understanding of where they came from, how they started, and how hard they worked to get there. Warning: you will cry! It\u2019s also really cool to start there so you can see just how much growth they\u2019ve achieved in the short 2.5 years since they debuted. If English subs work for you, here\u2019s a link to where you can watch [the reality show ](https://www3.dramacool.movie/drama-detail/stray-kids). The ads are a little annoying but can be worked with imo.\n\nEdit: They have put out an absolutely insane amount of content since they debuted. You will never not have something to watch or look forward to! If you go to vlive, there\u2019s all kinds of good content.",

They're talented, there close like a family, they put out so much content (music,interviews,vlogs,etc.) they even support the polished man foundation that helps prevent abuse against children. Like, Ateez is the definition of boyfriend material. Loved them since day one. Best way to check them out is on their youtube channel and their instagram.",

These guys are HILARIOUS and very genuine and sweet. They work incredibly hard and ALWAYS find a way to connect and engage with their fans. They will often have their fans pick their title tracks which is something that no other group in kpop has done to my knowledge.\n\nTheir discography is also one of the best in all of kpop - absolutely stellar.

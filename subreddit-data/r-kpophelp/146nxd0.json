    "postText": "Hi! I'm trying to find a song which I heard a couple years ago. It sounded like it was sung by AKMU, although I have searched most of their discography and haven't found anything. I solidly remember only a single part of its lyrics: it had \"1 2 3 4\" right before the chorus. I have posted on r/tipofmytongue as well and am asking for help here as I just found out that this sort of subreddit exists.\n\nMy best guess is that it was released in the late 2000's or 2010's (definitely before 2018). If it wasn't AKMU, then it had at least one male and one female voice singing. The song was generally upbeat. I do not know if this has an MV.\n\nHere's my serviceable-enough attempt at trying to hum what I remember from the song! [https://vocaroo.com/198iPyjNn0yT](https://vocaroo.com/198iPyjNn0yT)Note that the section beginning 1:25 might be a later bridge of the song before the final chorus\u2014I don't think that part immediately follows the rest of the recording.\n\nThank you!!\n\nEDIT 6/11/2023: I also found this video, which contains a handy number of songs that have similar lyrics but unfortunately doesn't contain the song I am looking for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KU2bAWcYd4",

    "postText": "I am super inexperienced when it comes to concerts, having only gone to one non-kpop concert and no kpop concerts ever before.  There's rumors of a Seventeen world tour and since I'll be in America next year, I'm hoping I would have a chance to go see them in concert.  However, since Seventeen is a very popular group, I know there would be a rush to get tickets, but I don't know what websites are usually used for selling kpop concert tickets, how the purchasing process works (what information do you need to provide besides your name, credit card stuff, etc., and where do they announce what time ticket orders open?), and where to find information about buying tickets for kpop concerts in general.  Where would I be able to find this information for concerts in the future?  Sorry if this is a stupid question &gt;.&lt;",

You just find the seats you want, add them to your cart, and pay for them. Ticketing details and directions on applying for fandom presale will probably be posted to Weverse since Seventeen's a HYBE group so be sure to follow them on there and turn on your notification for community notices.\n\nJust to give you some perspective, I was able to see Seventeen last year and had a really easy time getting tickets. I actually bought mine a week after they had gone on sale and there were still plenty of seats available at face value. And they were good seats too, not nosebleeds. SVT's popularity in the US is not as big as it is in Korea so you might not have to stress so much to try to get tickets unless you are trying to get VIP or barricade seats.",

They all use US based touring companies to handle this stuff. \n\nOnly thing that could be pretty different is how fan presales might work, whether it\u2019s fan club/app based/sign up but that and the process around it gets announced after the tour and dates drop.",

            "comment": "Honestly Xdinary Heroes are very unique for a band so I don\u2019t think anyone really comes close to their kind of vibe but still maybe you\u2019d like:\n\nGiuk, he\u2019s the bassist and rapper of ONEWE, he just released his debut album [Psycho Xybernetics : TURN OVER](https://youtu.be/M8wT081BSbI), the title track is [TIME MACHINE (2100)](https://youtu.be/2HF6lJWEM6A), I think his album shares a similar quirky yet heavy sound that a lot of Xdinary Heroes music has\n\n2Z, they\u2019re a band with kinda an old school kind of sound(?), I think the rapping is kind of similar to Xdinary Heroes rapping. [Doctor](https://youtu.be/JipujX1_8aQ), [1822](https://youtu.be/SaPbuV5sknY), [25](https://youtu.be/gTlrEpRLp_4)\n\nSome misc recs:\n- [Video Therapy](https://youtu.be/0ShZ-R0caQU) &amp; [Hot Potato](https://youtu.be/y1iRckD1ys4) - N.Flying\n- [Deep in love](https://youtu.be/NeKxYyHSxdk) - Day6\n- [Take Me Now](https://youtu.be/WsC0jG1M5jA) - FTISLAND",

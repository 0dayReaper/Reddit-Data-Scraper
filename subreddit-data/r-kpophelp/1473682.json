She did say she wanted to [clear out the searches](https://youtu.be/inwAM4-ZfRw?t=21m48s) but did not explicitly link it back to the group\u2019s name. I think given the meaning of their name it\u2019s not an unreasonable logical leap to make and that\u2019s probably why a lot of publications repeated that it was related to the group\u2019s name.",

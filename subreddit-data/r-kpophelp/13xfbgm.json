Unfortunately, I'm can't to find it (even Shazam doesn't know about it).\n\nHere is the link : [https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a8qeRo3\\_460svav1.mp4](https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/a8qeRo3_460svav1.mp4)\n\nIf anyone knows the song or at least know Korean and is able to tell me the lyrics, so I can find it alone will be very appreciated.\n\nI actually know how to read and write Korean, but it is pretty much all I can do (sadly).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help :)",

However, it's listed as a \uc870\uc120\uc871 \uac00\uc694(Joseon-jok gayo) which means it was recorded and sung by the Korean minority diaspora in China, so it wouldn't really count as K-pop.",

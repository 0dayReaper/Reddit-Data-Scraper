This happens a lot, and when you inspect literally all the kpop albums you will see the shrink wrap has been cut on almost all of them. I didn\u2019t know that was a thing and they let me exchange due to the album being my very first Koop purchase. They\u2019ll ask if you noticed the plastic wrap was opened, but I was honest and said I didn\u2019t know that was a thing to even look out for and did not check if it was fully sealed.\n\nThey let you exchange for equal value. You can be cool and bring other ruined albums to the front to help your point.",

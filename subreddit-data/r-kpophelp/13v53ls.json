    "postText": "So my fave bgs actually make music that is pretty hard-hitting with concepts on the darker side. Buuut I'm kinda looking to expand my horizons, and trying to discover stuff I usually wouldn't listen to/watch. So I'm looking for bg title tracks and boy group recommendations that do **NOT** contain the following:\n\n* These groups, because I already know their discography really well: Stray Kids, ONEUS, XHeroes, GOT7, Super Junior, Monsta X, BTS, Enhypen. I have also already heard most stuff from NCT, TXT, Seventeen but not all so you can try them I guess.\n* Hard-hitting, intense, noise or rock music\n* Dark, elegant concepts (like Enhypen or Kingdom)\n* Concepts where the main colors (especially for clothes) are black, white, and/or red\n* Concepts/videos that are mainly about looking though and cool (like XHeroes' Freakin Bad - which I love, it's just a useful example)\n\nIdeally, I'd prefer recommendations of/from active groups, and releases from the last 3 years max. Also, I would prefer groups who have had more than 1 comeback that avoids all the things on the list above.",

Can\u2019t promise that you\u2019re gonna like these and some of these are gonna be older but let\u2019s go!\n\n2nd/3rd gen group songs that are 100% worth checking out!\n\nSHINee: Married to the Music, Atlantis, View, I Want You, Good Evening, 1 of 1\n\nInfinite: Man In Love, The Chaser, Be Mine\n\nBTOB: Wind and Wish, Movie, Missing you\n\nSnuper (disbanded): Platonic Love, It\u2019s raining\n\nPretty much all SEVENTEEN songs between 2016 and 2018 like: Very Nice, Mansae, Adore U, Oh My!, Pretty U and Clap to name my faves\n\nI\u2019m not as familiar with 4th gen so far but I do have a few recs:\n\nTempest: Taste The Feeling\n\nP1Harmony: Doom Du Doom (a bit on the heavier side maybe but not very dark or elegant)\n\nLUCY (band): Play, Flowering\n\nN.Flying (band): Moonshot\n\nThese are mostly just from the top of my head but it\u2019s a good start imo. I hope you find something you like!",

I'd especially recommend [Beautiful Beautiful](https://youtu.be/0pwBFTUJBzQ), [Complete](https://youtu.be/ka9zaVL28OY), [Popping](https://youtu.be/QRlCPJ1-pCo), and [On/Off](https://youtu.be/RQlMI0n10VY). \n\nThey also some some darker concepts like [We Must Love](https://youtu.be/ukZ0cnIeMXQ) and [Why](https://youtu.be/BodVjFLsi8o), but there's a pretty consistent sound across all their albums, probably because they've worked with the same producer (Monotree) since debut.",

You and I have kind of similar taste so I think you're gonna like it.\n\nAlso definitely check out CIX. They have a pretty diverse range of concepts but maintain a consistent, mature sound. Their debut song [Movie Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FV74Nbu0i0) is probably something you'll enjoy. I also love [Numb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHx-kNjEYZM), [Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khGjK2Ml80Y), and my favorite is [Jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eqJAKDL2zQ). It's on the darker side (and they are wearing red and black) but the video is visually stunning and unique from others. They also just released a comeback [Save me, Kill me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkR33wOTTcA) that is dark but more in a sad way than edgy way. If you want something super bright and cute, then check out their Japanese releases [All For You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDYXW4tllIc) and [Pinky Swear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srmRtW_d9BA).\n\nedit: ok come to think of it a few of these are a little hard-hitting but I still think you'll like them!",

But still a mega different emotional and physical experience than a harder, dance or hip hop focused group, id recommend starting with \"cant let you go even if i die\" theyre still active but no idea when they last released something. Also their song titles are ridiculous lol\n\nAlso WEI - I saw a lot of arohas also liked them when they debuted, theyre similar to astro in the sense that most of their videos are colorful and cute. I liked their song \"too bad\" dont really know the others but if arohas like them id say their other songs are probly chiller, cuter vibes",

    "postText": "I know a lot of people have had questions on this wondering if the songs Kakao M removed would be back on Spotify. I\u2019ve read various articles [(here\u2019s one from Variety that I found)](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/variety.com/2021/digital/news/spotify-k-pop-kakao-licensing-dispute-1234927727/amp/) saying the songs distributed by Kakao M will be coming back to Spotify soon! (I hope this helps you out!)\n\nDoes anyone know how soon it will be, why it happened in the first place? All I know is that there was a dispute but I don\u2019t really know a lot more than that.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realise this would be so popular, thank you for the award! I\u2019m happy the Spotify issue has been resolved now:)",

            "comment": "That Variety article kinda explains why it happened. Basically, Spotify just opened in Korea, and at the time of opening there was no agreement with Kakao M so within Spotify Korea, there were no Kakao M songs available yet. Because Kakao M runs their own streaming service in Korea (Melon) they would  probably want to negotiate a contract for distribution of their songs that was favorable enough that they wouldn't lose too much money if people chose to leave Melon for the newly opened Spotify Korea.\n\nThere seems to be two separate licenses that go into this: a global license (affecting countries other than Korea) and a domestic license (affecting only Korea).\n\n[According to Spotify](https://www.soompi.com/article/1456872wpp/spotify-officially-explains-why-hundreds-of-k-pop-releases-were-removed-from-platform-worldwide) the deliberation over the distribution licensing had been ongoing for a year and a half by the time this whole thing started getting messy.\n\n[According to Kakao M](https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/kakao-m-claims-spotify-policy-forced-removal-of-k-pop-songs-2891168) the problem arose when the global license coincidentally expired while discussions were still underway for the domestic license. The global license was probably already nearly up for renewal and Kakao M hoped to just renew that before continuing domestic discussions, but they claimed that Spotify said that both global and domestic had to be negotiated at the same time now that they were both up for negotiation.\n\nBecause they couldn't immediately reach a deal to settle both at once, the global license expired and everything became unavailable. \n\nLabels and artists (as well as fans, of course) were not happy about their music being unavailable because that deprived them of exposure and streaming revenue that Spotify would have otherwise provided, so essentially Kakao M was not properly doing their job of actually distributing, hence why artists such as [Tablo](https://twitter.com/blobyblo/status/1366051073723494400?s=21) posted about being upset with the situation. There was probably some internal pressure on Kakao M to get something sorted out quickly before more of their clients got mad.\n\n10 days later they seem to have settled on a deal so now things will come back and now will additionally be available on Spotify Korea as well.\n\nI'm not sure how long it will take for the songs to be actually reenabled. My hopeful guess is midnight KST today because it had initially expired at midnight KST as well. Maybe it'll take longer but nothing seems to be announced either way so we just... wait, I guess\n\nedit: looks like my guess was correct and the songs returned at approximately midnight KST. If there are songs still grayed out in your playlists, try playing them from the artist page first and they should sync back up and should work in your playlists again.",

            "comment": "In simple terms, Spotify is coming to Korea, and Kakao M is threatened because they own Melon which is the biggest music streaming platform in Korea (basically a monopoly) and Spotify might change that. So this is quite petty of them to pull out the songs owned by kakao m or smth (not sure about the actual process) but apparently Spotify is also involved, since it happened the day AFTER the payment of subscription fees lol",

They timed the day the contracts expired with their movement into Korea even though global licences are different.\n\nKakao M is mainly interested in the Korea licence, but Spotify made Kakao M look bad, probably getting Spotify a better deal",

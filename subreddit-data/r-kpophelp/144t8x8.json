    "postText": "I'm getting married in a couple weeks and I'm building a kpop playlist for my DJ to pull from since he's not familiar with kpop. Since over half of my guests have never listened to kpop, I vetted all the songs so that they are easy to dance to even if you've never heard it before (so not just fan faves)\n\n\nPlease share your suggestions! I mostly have BTS, Seventeen, and Twice, with a couple of throwbacks like Sorry Sorry and Ring Ding Dong. The main problem with my fave songs is that they tend to have a break (rap, dance, or vocal) that totally throws off the vibe if you're on the dance floor.",

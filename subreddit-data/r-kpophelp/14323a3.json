    "postText": "(Not sure if this should be marked as \"unsolved\" or \"explain\"...I don't really need anything solved, since I can return item for replacement and solve my own problem...but rather looking for someone to explain that this is a thing that indeed does happen or doesn't happen, but will reflair post if need be)\n\nI recently ordered a few albums from amazon, all via amazon prime. It's my first time ordering kpop albums from amazon, though I order plenty of other stuff from there and don't usually have problems (any problems are usually confusion or annoyance over the packaging they chose for the item, rather than problems with the item itself). Two of the albums are the sort of pouch style, and it's easy to tell they haven't been opened or anything like that. The third one is a second copy of an album I have already. I ordered it for pc collection purposes, and then planned to resell the rest of the album like I've done a few times in the past. As soon as I took this album out of the amazon packaging I knew it was weird. The album itself is already kind of slim and not super heavy, but this one seemed way lighter than I remembered the first one I got being. So I open this album...it was completely shrink wrapped as normal (as was the first one I got of this album from somewhere else), the barcode sticker on the outside of the shrink wrap had the correct artist and album name on it. Once I had the shrink wrap off it had this sort of gooey, but dry, gunk on one end. The album is designed with a slipcover where both ends are open, and this gunk was super easy to peel off and it didn't seem to damage the album or contents, so I wondered if it was used to keep stuff from falling out...but that doesn't make sense since it was only on one end, and the album had been shrink wrapped anyway, so how could anything fall out if the whole thing is inside shrink wrap? I don't know. But I take this gunk off, and check out the album...before even taking anything out of the album I realize there's no photobook like there was in the previous copy of this album that I had already. I double checked my order to make sure I hadn't ordered some non-photobook version of the album, nope I had ordered a regular new version of it, and also the album only has one version available at all, so there is no like photobook-less compact version or anything. I find this really weird. Then I take the rest of the things out of the album...for some reason there were two of the same lyrics poster, and two of the same CD. Again, there is only one version of the album available anywhere, so there is no deluxe version that includes a second CD, both CDs were the same copy of the same track list. There were a few of the inclusions, but no poster and no PCs like the new sealed album is supposed to have. And one of the inclusions looked quite dirty/dusty/fingerprinty \n\nAre there people or businesses selling on amazon prime that take apart and repackage albums, adding all new shrink wrap and barcode stickers and everything? I've heard stories of people who will go to places like Target or Walmart and discreetly cut the shrink wrap on albums so they can let the photocards fall out and they can steal just the photocards, and they put the album back on the shelf, and heard of other people winding up buying these albums not knowing that had happened to them before they bought them. Does something like this happen ever with albums sold on amazon? I've always bought albums from an artists official company/label store before, and this is the first time I've bought any kpop albums from somewhere other than that, so I'm kind of confused if this is a common occurrence. The title and photos of the item on amazon list it as new, list it as including everything...I had wanted to buy the item new, and if I knew this was coming from someone reselling without any inclusions, then I wouldn't have bought this particular listing (since I was buying it to collect the inclusions myself). I'm not too mad or annoyed, since I can just return it to amazon for a replacement, and I was going to drop off some other returns already tomorrow anyway lol. I'm really mostly just super super confused...especially why they would have taken out the two average size random draw pcs, but not the *also* random draw postcard, and also why they would put *two of the same* CD and lyrics posters in there...none of this makes sense to me lol. And I've bought plenty of pcs secondhand from places like Mercari, and in the past I bought a few albums secondhand from there or other places as well, and I have never experienced a seller re-shrink wrapping the album, as if it was coming from some shop as new, rather than from a fan reselling the album.\n\nI'm confused lol. Someone please say I'm not the only one this sort of thing has happened to, or explain to me that adding doubles of items to a resold album (2 CDs, 2 lyric posters) is normal, or that re-shrink wrapping an album is normal. Or that that gooey gunk I had to peel off of one end of the album is normal.",

            "comment": "Yes. I ordered a 4-set of BTS love yourself her and a 4-set of love yourself tear. Instead of the original shrink wrap, they were all together in a single resealable bag and all the PCs were gone. Luckily Amazon accepted a return request for me no problem because that was a lot of money otherwise.",

                    "comment": "Dang, that's so weird. I've ordered a few non-kpop things that wound up being like that, where if they were ordered as one they would come packaged properly, but when I ordered more than one, it was like somewhere along the way they got taken out of their single packaging and put all together in new packaging before going into the outer amazon packaging. \n\nSame about amazon this time for me too, they accepted the return. I had them send a replacement, but I don't know if it'll be sent from the same exact seller/from the quantity that seller is pulling from for that listing, or if it will be from someone/somewhere else. If the replacement album is the same and is all wonky like this one I'll probably just wind up getting it somewhere else instead lol. Did they send you a replacement that was ok for the bts albums, or did you wind up still getting them somewhere else?",

Greentris, K-Cloud, etc).\n\nNearly all kpop albums are sold by non-Amazon businesses, so you have to be vigilant about that. If you want to make sure you are buying officially, check the group\u2019s official SNS and use the specific link from there. For example, aespa has a linktree in their bio which has the pre-order for My World (Amazon Exclusive Poster Ver.) that explicitly states \u201cSold by: Amazon.com\u201d so you know it\u2019s legit. If you click another version of My World on Amazon, it\u2019s sold by Boooly Mall. Of course, some of these non-Amazon businesses could be legit, but I would try to look at their storefront reviews in case.\n\nIt\u2019s always possible that the store was gullible and accepted someone else\u2019s return and resealed and resold the item. But you would be able to glean if that\u2019s an issue if you look at the storefront reviews.",

But the store on amazon only has a few reviews, and they're pretty mixed, and some other people saying they didn't get photocard in their album too \ud83d\ude2c. I'll see what the replacement one amazon sends is like, and if it's weird to then I'll def get it somewhere else.",

I wonder if it's the individual sellers or if it's some department at amazon who approves/denies reviews, I'd be kind of curious to find out if sellers are allowed to deny negative reviews being posted. I just wrote a review for this one, so I'll see if it gets approved or not.",

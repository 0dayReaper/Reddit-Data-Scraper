    "postText": "TLDR: where to access more zb1 content and how to hardcore stan\n\nHi, I\u2019m not exactly new to the kpop fandom, was in it since 2017. Not an avid fan either, just like listening to their music and watching their mvs, liking their ig posts etc (groups like txt, nct 127, day6, exo, svt, ive, twice, i cld go on but ill stop here)\n\n\nYet, Im still not sure where to access all their content , exclusive or not and how to manoeuvre through the process of hardcore stanning. Recently ive been into ZB1 and i really wna catch their lives aft they debut but im not sure which platforms to use. I used to use vlive too before the merge. I heard kep1er is using bubble with stars so zb1 might too. \n\nAnyways how else do i interact with their (and other grps in general) content besides the usual ig,twt,tiktok and youtube? \n\nThanks in advance :)",

You can look at some big fan accounts and see who they retweet updates from, these accounts typically post schedules/updates/translations. They would also live tweet translations when lives/broadcasts happen. I would also try to find one in your area if possible but it can be difficult if you live outside of Asia, as they would have Group Orders and occasionally host local events for birthdays and anniversaries",

    "postText": "Hi there! Hopefully this is the correct place to ask this question. I got tickets for blackpink in Vegas when tickets were released. I noticed the other day when looking at the tickets on ticketmaster it tells me something about a VVIP wristband? When I click on ticket information it just tells me VVIP wristband is under entry info. I, for the life of me, cannot find any information of what it actually entails if anything? Anyone have any ideas? It would be much appreciated! I'm in Section C112 if that helps any! Thank you for your time!",

    "postText": "I know not everyone does, but I absolutely adore group photocards! Itzy is my ult group and I'm trying to find their group cards, so I was just wondering if anyone has any list or templates of them? I've looked everywhere but I can't find any. I'm trying to make my own but there's just such a lack of information about group cards that I can't find exactly how many exist.\n\nI have a few- one from CSI and a pob from Guess Who era. I really don't care what they're from, pobs, merch, fanmeets, etc. If it's the group, I'd love to have it. I KNOW the most recent fanmeet has some (the princess concept) and I know there are other pobs, so I'm just looking to see if anyone has any information on what is out there. Photos or videos would be extremely helpful too if anyone has any!!",

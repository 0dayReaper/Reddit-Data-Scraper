            "comment": "- Shopee is possible but honestly idk anyone who sources there since most people in SG have a shopee and can just get them themselves, and shopee is also harder to do verification and such \n- The most common sourcing platforms I see on telegram are Twitter (Korean Yangdo) and Mercari (Japan). For Twitter, I usually google a group\u2019s name in Hangul and \ud3ec\uce74 \uc591\ub3c4 (Poca Yangdo) and see what people are selling. You\u2019ll need to find a Kadd service and get Wise (which afaik can do kr bank transfer)/PayPal because most of these Korean sellers only ship to Korea and accept Korean bank transfer/PayPal occasionally. Mercari is usually for Japanese sellers, and is a bit more straightforward in that you have to buy through the proxy service Buyee, which has a warehouse service iirc. The general idea is to consolidate enough PCs at the Kadd/warehouse that when you ship the items, the shipping cost is split to something more affordable to buyers. \n- Some less common platforms are Xianyu (China) and Bunjang (Korea). I know nothing about these, sorry. \n\nObligatory disclaimer that I\u2019m not a GOM, just been on the collecting side of telegram for two years and considered starting my own channel at some point",

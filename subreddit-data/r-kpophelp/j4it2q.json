I\u2019m 17 and I\u2019ve never really been into k-pop before but recently I\u2019ve started listening to some and I\u2019m really loving it (especially MAMAMOO and BTS.) \n  \nHowever, I\u2019m autistic and often struggle to understand things unless explained and I feel too nervous to interact with K-pop fans as I don\u2019t understand many of the terms you use.\n\n Could someone please explain the common terms used by the fandom (such as bias, comeback, debut, etc..) to me or link me to something that explains them. I would greatly appreciate it as I would really like to interact with people who like the same music as me.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much! Everyone has been so incredibly kind and I feel much less confused than before! This has got to be on of the kindest internet experiences of my life. I\u2019m incredibly thankful for the welcomeness. :)",

A few terms:\n\nBias - simply your favorite, may or may not be the one you wish you could date, not everyone has one. It\u2019s the person you are most interested in knowing about and who your eyes follow when you watch the group.\n\nBias wrecker- second favorite or the one you didn\u2019t think you liked most but you always notice\n\nComeback - a new release. Unlike Western pop, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s been a long time since the artist/group had the spotlight.  Anything new after debut is a comeback.\n\nedit:\n\nAnd debut is simply the first official release of music. There\u2019s usually a lot of predebut activity like the videos of the members doing cover songs, but this the first real one.  Usually with a big promotional push from the company.  Enhypen is a \u201cpredebut group\u201d as an example.",

They usually release concept photos, teasers and the tracklist before, and after the song/songs is/are out, they will go to promote on music shows. They perform the songs there, you can watch them on Youtube.\n\nTitle track - the song they will perform on music shows first from their album or mini album. This song is the one what will get a music video first as well\n\nB-sides - the other songs from the album or mini album. Some groups promote one b-side in music shows after the title track's promotion ended,and one or two b-side will probably have a music video later\n\nThey can win awards in music shows, they can earn it based on their sales,stream, fan votes and on how well the song is doing on charts. \n\nDaesang - major awards, they can get them in year-end award shows. \n\nROTY - Rookie of the year, best new female or male artist. Groups who debuted between January and October can get them, but if someone debuts in November, they will be eligible for the next years awards. \n\nAOTY - Album of the year\n\nSOTY - Song of the year \n\nYou can read about the positions in a group [here](https://kprofiles.com/kpop-positions-explained/)\n\nI hope I helped. :)",

            "comment": "Other people covered some of the most common ones, so here are some others, including ones that confused me at first:\n\nStan- comes from Eminem\u2019s song of the same name, originally meant in a negative stalker-fan way, but most people now use it to be mean \u201cpassionate fan.\u201d\n\nSolo stan- only cares for one group member, indifferent to the others but doesn\u2019t bash them. \n\nAkgae- short for \u201cakseong gainpaein\u201d or \u201cmalicious individual fan,\u201d bashes other members of the group. \nEdit: fixed definition to differentiate solo stan from akgae \n\nNaver- Korean search engine and blog site, sort of like  how ubiquitous Google is in other countries. Has trending topics like Twitter, people will mention when their faves trend for something notable usually. \n\nFancaf\u00e9- not real places, more like a subreddit for a group. Different from group-specific subreddits in that idols take part in their own fancaf\u00e9s answering questions or posting sometimes. \nEdit: fancaf\u00e9s are usually hosted on Daum, a Korean website that offers many services, such as email and forums \n\nFansite- dedicated photo blog for an idol, often used to describe the person behind the blog, i.e. \u201cShe\u2019s a fansite.\u201d\n\nFansign- Like a meet-and-greet that you have to win a slot for by buying albums, so people usually buy a lot to get in. The idol signs your poster etc. and chats with you for a bit as you move down the line. People will often give idols stuffed animals or have them wear cute things briefly as fanservice. \n\nHi-touch- Like a fansign but even shorter, like you say hi and high-five them, I believe. Often post-concert as part of the VIP package if you buy that. \n\nHard stan- being into an idol sexually.\n\nSoft stan- opposite of hard stan, avoids explicitly sexual content about idols. \n\nWeVerse- an app similar to the concept of fancaf\u00e9s (i.e. direct idol-fan digital interaction) different in that international fans can create accounts, though content is usually Korean-language-only. Only some groups are on here since it was initially developed by Big Hit, the company behind BTS.\n\nMenpa- short for \u201cmention party,\u201d a Twitter phenomenon where idols will occasionally answer fan questions for a short period of time through their official group accounts. \n\nI hope this is helpful and not too overwhelming. There are other neurodivergent fans on here, I\u2019m one of them (ADHD), so you\u2019re not alone.",

So you have a bias in each group but among them, there's the favorite of favorites.\n\nOppa - a word to call an older guy when you are a girl. Since I am old, I would probably call Yunho of TVXQ \"Yunho oppa\" while someone born in 95 can call RM of BTS \"Namjoon oppa\" (or just oppa) but not Jungkook since he is younger. Also in Korean sometimes people will say \"oppa will buy you a coffee\" instead of \"I will buy you a coffee\" (when the guy that is an oppa to you says it to you, of course) which is why you have the lyric \"oppa is gangnam style\" when he really means \"I am gangnam style (and also talking to a girl younger than me or that I like/is my girlfriend/would like to be my girlfriend).\n\nNoona - same but if you are a guy talking to an older girl\n\nHyung - same but if you are a guy talking to an older guy\n\nUnnie - same but if you are a girl talking to an older girl\n\nCoordi/coordi unnie - a slightly endearing name for the stylists (coordinators) or a group especially if they did a good job styling them for a comeback for example. E.g. Someone give the coordi of The Boyz an award for the work on The Stealer",

So because you've mentioned liking BTS and in case you start stanning them you may see some ARMY (bts' fandom name) talking about supporting \"ot7\" (which means \"one true 7\"). Bts has 7 member so if you're ot7 that means that you support all 7 of them. (for example if you start stanning mamamoo you would be supporting ot4 because mamamoo has 4 members).\n In general even if you were to chose a bias in BTS you would still be ot7 but it is entirely possible for you not to have a bias so when someone asks you what is your bias you can just say \"I'm ot7\" which would mean that all 7 seven members are your favorites because you don't have a member you bias. \ud83d\ude0a Hope this helps a bit and feel free to ask me if you need help with clarifying some other terms!",

Before they had lightsticks fans would wave actual vegetables in their performaces.\n\nAnother pretty self-explanatory if you know any korean is that Moonbyul is called Moonstar because that's literally her name. Her last name is Mun or Moon and her first name is Byul-i, which means star. So for her stage name she just combined it to Moonbyul.\n\nMamamoo are often called beagles or beagle-dols, this is because they get so hyper and crazy and loud. I do believe this was first used by MCs in variety so it's kind of a compliment. \n\nSimilarly, Wheein gets called Wheepup or puppy a lot, this is also because of the craziness but also because she's cute.\n\nSolar gets called Yeba a lot, and this comes from yeppun babo, literally pretty fool. So if she does or says something not-too-smart sounding Moomoos will probably call her that in the comments.\n\nAnother obvious one is that Hwasa gets called the fatal maknae, becuase well, she's very sexy is  style and because she is the youngest of the group. In fact sometimes for example youtube comments divine thm into \"maknae line\" and \"unnie line\". This is just to underscore that Solar and Byul are older and Wheein and Hwasa are youngest, and in fact the same age, Hwasa was just born later.\n\nAlso, since Mamamoo actually has only genral positions per person (Solar: Leader, Vocal, Moonbyul, Rap, Performance [dance], Wheein: Vocal, Performance. Hwasa: Rap, vocal, maknae)  they have no \"main dancer\" or \"main vocal\". If you see any of them called main or lead anything it's either a mistake, a compliment or possibly sarcastic if they are making a mistake or doing something goofy.",

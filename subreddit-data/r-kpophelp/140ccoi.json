    "postText": "I only have experience with Neokyo, so Paysable is pretty confusing for me. I've tried searching on the entire World Wide Web for tutorials specific to Auto Purchase but I am still left perplexed. Do I purchase the product on my own and then fill the form out? If I'm buying on Gmarket, how do I find the seller's bank info and bank account number?\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "Are you sending to paysable as well? You can simply check out on the global Gmarket site &amp; pay there then use your paysable address for shipping. You don't need to use paysable to pay them.  They accept PayPal &amp; credit cards.  \n\nBut in general,  Auto Purchase will be different on each site. Sometimes during check out you select deposit without bank book option. Then they either provide the bank info for deposit or once you check out you get the bank info via email. You do the auto purchase in paysable after, and the site either sends email confirmation or your order status changes to payment confirmed on website.\n\nAre you planning to send things to your korean address in general?  Some times you can't make an account without a kr mobile number so you won't be able to order the items yourself. You'll need to do a manual purchase with paysable.",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! Recently I\u2019ve gotten more into K-pop and I bought a few pcs from sellers on IG.\n\nDoes anyone have experience in how long it takes people to ship out generally? A lot of the profiles I saw said that they might take \u201cawhile.\u201d \n\nI ordered two pcs from two different sellers about a month ago and haven\u2019t received yet \ud83d\ude2d I also sent them both a follow up asking if they\u2019d shipped yet last week and both have not replied yet. I\u2019m getting nervous, wondering if I should charge back if I don\u2019t hear from them soon so I just sent another follow up today (no response as of rn either). They both do have a lot of \u201cproof\u201d of sending but it seems insane they haven\u2019t shipped yet and are both ignoring me. \n\nHas this been your experience buying from IG? Personally after two bad experiences I might stick to eBay or Mercari in the future bc at least those sites kinda give you a timeline to ship out \ud83d\ude29 Open to suggestions for other places too!",

            "comment": "I trade/sell on Instagram! Most people there are younger and have school or jobs, so if they're slow to ship out, they should have it written in their bio or in their info. Most people have \"ship days\" where they only go to the post office once a week, or once every 2 weeks, and it's usually written. Some people have a story highlight or a google spreadsheet that has updates.\n\nYou said they both have a lot of proof, what kind of proof? Hundreds of proofs? Are they shared clickable stories or screenshots with usernames cropped out? Are they recent/old? Have you gotten any address confirmation/packing proof from them yet?\n\nIf they're ignoring you, my guess is either that they're scammers *or* they have some sort of update system and don't have time to reply to every single person",

They do have my address and one of them sent a pic of the envelope w my name but no confirmation about sending out. \n\nI checked through their highlights / links and if just has some basic info for one of them but nothing about procedures or timelines haha. \n\nI am inclined to think they might not be scammers bc they haven\u2019t blocked me even tho I messaged them a couple times though and with the info I shared in mind. \n\nHaha it just kind of sucks and I\u2019m not really sure what to do atp.",

            "comment": "Did the sellers have information in their bio/story highlights/carrd about their standard shipping procedures/next ship dates?\n\nA month is a very long time. I\u2019ve bought from sellers who only ship once a week/every couple weeks but they have always clearly indicated ship dates on their profile so people are aware.\n\nFor their proofs, are these clickable proofs where you can get to the buyers\u2019 profiles by tapping the images in their stories, or are they screenshot proofs which can easily be fabricated?\n\nI\u2019ve never had bad experiences on IG, I just stopped buying from there because I kept getting ghosted by sellers after reading their information and requesting to buy correctly. Mercari and eBay tend to be overpriced but at least there are buyer protections and I can just click to buy. I don\u2019t buy a TON of PCs so it\u2019s usually worth the extra cost for me to avoid the hassle.",

I feel like after my experience it also might be worth it for me to pay a bit more like you said for other sites w buyer protections haha",

            "comment": "Regardless of if they're a slow shipper, the fact that they aren't responding to your message within a week is a bit frowned upon. I've been buying, trading, and selling on IG for almost a year I guess, more than half a year anyway, and when someone takes that long to respond to a message I'll first check to see if they've been active in other parts of IG like if they've posted or made a story. If not, I'll wait another few days and then resend my dm. \n\nIf so, I'll send them another dm very politely and neutrally reasking the question. I won't mention I saw they were active yet. But if they don't answer that within a week or so I then say 'I see you've been active, can you please answer my dm because I feel like I might be getting scammed at this point and it's making me pretty anxious'.  Sometimes that works as people are busy and maybe they really didn't realize how much time had passed or whatnot. I'll try a few more times if they still won't, spacing them closer together getting a bit more curt each time. Not mean but not overly nice, no emoji, no exclamation mark. I'll be honest that's as far as I've had to go personally, thankfully, so far.\n\nYou kind of have to just see how you feel and what you're comfortable saying. There are people a lot more and a lot less patient than I am. You get a feel for it as you go. In the beginning, if you're trying to build a name for yourself in the community, I'd start slow and cautious just because it gives you a bit of a disadvantage being the new person if things really go wrong.\n\nEverything I've said here is my own opinion only based on my own experiences. Good luck, and I hope they just ship slow.",

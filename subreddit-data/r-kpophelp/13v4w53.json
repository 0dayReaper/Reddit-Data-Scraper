Not that the others are bad at all, but there is no dancer like Taemin in the world (in my opinion). There are probably many great dancers, but no one like Taemin. There is only one Taemin. \n\nI don't even have a thing for dancers, but I have been drawn to him as an artist from day 1, and my interest has never lessened. I do not get tired of watching him dance, and I feel that doing so (watching his performances) is a balm to my soul, at times. That is how transfixed he has made me.",

They all have talent.\n\nI can barely walk and chew gum at the same time so I wish I had the talent of a Kpop trainee who never made it to debut.  I know how much I have NO PLACE judging dancing skills.

My god...\n\nJihyo - Her work ethic and stage presence speak for themselves. Her solocams from Fancy/More and More era were mesmerizing. She really exemplifies what a leader should look like and what example they should set.\n\nJeon Soyeon - Seeing the concepts she pulls off whilst simultaneously knowing that she is the producing force behind G-Idle blows my mind each time.\n\nDBSK (Yunho/Changmin) - Their promotions for Catch Me were a level of excellence that most male idols these days strive to emulate.\n\nKwon Eunbi - She really blew me away as IzOne promoted, but watching her moments in Panorama, and then her stages for Glitch and Underwater cemented that she really was the best thing to come out that group.\n\n(All of) Seventeen - They always amaze me with their work ethic and how much each member pushes the envelope.",

Even when he just dances to mess around, his moves are just perfect. \n\nLike he could have a whole conversation with you just by dancing. \n\nAnyways... Realized i liked him more than taemin when he did this \nhttps://youtu.be/DcUbKb7QJ_8",

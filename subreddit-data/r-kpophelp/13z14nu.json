I've seen on another post on this sub that there are country-specific groups for this kind of sale, does anyone know a brazilian one? Or any safe place for an international sale, if it comes to it. \n\nI have the limited vinyl edition of The Album and since I have no desire to have a kpop nor a vinyl collection (plus I don't listen to it very often) I don't see the point of having it with me.",

            "comment": "Many people sell on mercari and eBay. Some people sell official stuff on Etsy, but usually this is mostly used by fan creators who make themed items or art. I think some people use depop too. I\u2019m not sure if mercari and depop are US specific, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen any international sellers there. But I\u2019ve seen sellers from all over on eBay and Etsy. You could also try selling on Instagram, but there are probably country specific tags for that that you\u2019d want to tag the post with. I\u2019ve never bought or sold on Instagram, so I\u2019m not familiar with the tags, but I\u2019m sure someone here might know them, or you could try googling like \u201cselling blackpink brazil Instagram tags\u201d and it might bring up a list of some tags to use.",

    "postText": "I pre ordered a skz 5STAR album from this German site, I'm from Italy. They said June 2nd it was ready at the DHL to be shipped but I can't track my order and since then I didn't have any update. Is it normal? Everything is in German and i hardly understand it. Maybe it's just the high demand of preorders but it's been almost a week now.. I'm a bit nervous and excited, the fact that the DHL site isn't tracking my order is pissing me off a bit because I just want my package to arrive on time",

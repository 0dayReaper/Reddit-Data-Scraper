    "postText": "Hello there. I'm new to the sub, and I'm hoping you guys can help me out.\n\nI've recently got into KPOP, but I only listen to the tracks in Japanese because I don't understand Korean; a big part of the fun for me is singing along. So far I've exhausted the discographies of the following KPOP groups for good JP tracks, and I've found a few here and there, but I'm hoping you all can make some recommendations. I'll also make a short list of what songs I like so you can get a feel for what I'm looking for. In exchange, I'd be happy to do translations of JP songs (I know I don't have much to offer here).\n\n\nGirl groups/singers only. \n\nLOONA\n\nBLACKPINK\n\nTWICE\n\nMAMAMOO\n\nLE SSERAFFIM\n\nIVE\n\nXG (no JP tracks...)\n\nRED VELVET\n\nMOONCHILD (JP origin)\n\nNiziU (JP origin)\n\n4Minute\n\nGirls Generation\n\n2NE1\n\nThe Grace/Tenjochiki\n\nTAEYON (solo JP releases)\n\n\nI prefer pop fun/cute hooks over edgy/bad bitch stuff. Anything with a discernable r&amp;b influence always does it for me as well. I appreciate girls that can actually sing well (think of the vocal stylings of The Grace/Tenjochiki), but if it's catchy enough I can look past questionable vocals/vocal direction.\n\n\nSongs in heavy rotation currently:\n\nTWICE - MORE &amp; MORE \n\nTWICE - HAPPY HAPPY\n\nTWICE - In the summer \n\nTWICE - Four leaf Clover\n\nTWICE - What is Love?\n\nTWICE - CANDY POP\n\nNiziU - ASOBO\n\nNiziU - \u8679\u306e\u5411\u3053\u3046\u3078\n\n4minute - Can't Make Up My Mind\n\n4minute - Sugar Sugar Honey \n\nLE SSERAFIM - CHOICES\n\nLE SSERAFIM - Blue Flame\n\nMAMAMOO - You Don't Know Me\n\nMAMAMOO - Shampoo\n\nMAMAMOO - Delcalcomanie \n\n\nI use Spotify which doesn't have all the JP releases unfortunately, but if Apple Music has more then I'll subscribe to that. I'm interested in hearing GFRIEND's Japanese works, but they aren't on Spotify.",

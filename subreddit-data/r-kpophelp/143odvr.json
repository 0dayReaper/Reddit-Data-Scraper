Their 'It's Live' covers are especially good ( [Lovesick Boys ](https://youtu.be/N0DEOjLKRC8), [Savage ](https://youtu.be/uExigbPVPGE), and [Not Shy](https://youtu.be/-3Ii-GtRAHo)). \n\nThey are huge Blinks and have covered BP a lot. Aside from Lovesick Boys, some examples are Hui's re-arrangement of Shut Down for boys planet, the collad with ONF of Kill This Love for Road to Kingdom, Kino covering Pink Venom on Masked Singer, and recently Jinho did an arrangement of a Kill This Love cover for his final stage on Phantom Singer with his crossover group Crezl (feat an opera singer, musical theatre singer, and traditional Korean folk singer).\n\nAlso Kino has one of the most perfect covers of Chunga's [Gotta Go](https://youtu.be/7kuabopW-do) I've ever seen.\n\n(There are more but that's some of them).",

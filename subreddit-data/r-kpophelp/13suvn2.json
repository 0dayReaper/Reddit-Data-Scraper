    "postText": "I was washing the dishes tonight when Apple Music's \"For You\" playlist slapped me upside the head with a track I'd never heard before, but loved so instantly that I *had* to look at my phone. Lo, it was \"[Baddie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEf85yK272k)\" by Cravity. What a banger.\n\nI'm already obsessed with this track, and I know I'm going to be listening to it incessantly. But the more awesome songs to add to my library the better, so:\n\n\\- Can you suggest to me other songs (by any group) that have a similar sound/vibe to this one?\n\n\\- Any other Cravity bangers you'd recommend?\n\nThanks!",

I don\u2019t think any of them are a *perfect* fit, but hopefully some will be close enough! \ud83e\udd1e\n\nValkyrie (Rock ver.) and No Diggity - Oneus\n\nVideo Therapy - N.Flying\n\nMarch - Seventeen\n\nMonster - Drippin\n\nHijack - Woodz (not as certain about this one)\n\nGasoline - Key (also: not the same vibe as Baddie, but I feel like you might like Bound or Villain \ud83d\udc40)\n\nONE(Lucid Dream) - Golden Child\n\nSavage - A.C.E.\n\nMy Turn - Cravity \n\nVamos - Omega X\n\nForm - Vanner",

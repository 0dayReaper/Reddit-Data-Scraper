I LOVE [N.Flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8SnRN0114k), [Xdinary Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSZSCQkUnx4), [ONEWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0heWyFJ6bsA), of course [DAY6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWUGikRxGQs). \n\nRecently, I also found out about [**ChoCo**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJqvwApRIMA) \\- the members are still trainees but Mnet has a show on them called \"ChoCo In Hollywood\" where they show their training and there are clips of them playing bass, drums and such and performing as a band. ([**Watch show here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp6_2XER1XY&amp;t=567s)) ([**Listen to album here**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kqpmUxp4n5ZosZR49S6L5GmH_GdjToYBI))\n\nI just want to go down the rabbit hole of idol bands so if you know more, please recommend your faves!! Much appreciated.",

I used to think an idol group just means (apart from having choreographies) they'd have more exposure to variety shows and other non-music content. \n\nBut I'm beginning to feel like it's quite muddled when bands go on to shows like *Top Band* and *Superband* and/or are formed through survival shows.",

Anyways back to the variety discussion, Xheroes have been on Weekly idol more than once, though, so have akmu and I don\u2019t consider them idols so Weekly idol is kind of a weak point lol. Still you see Xheroes with their idol like series rock the world and making appearances on other idol shows like human idol theater. \n\nAnother thing I also think is the albums/concepts are different, obviously doesn\u2019t speak for every release but overall just comparing, [And then there was us](https://images.app.goo.gl/4YxLJmGSW7T4fbHG6) vs [Deadlock](https://images.app.goo.gl/yerxyabPrckBL2Kt8) there are differences in concept and inclusions(I will say Hyunsangs solo albums come with alot) Can\u2019t deny that there are also budget differences, in this case I\u2019ll say company based. \n\nNext, Choreo, even tho they\u2019re a band Xheroes actually have choreo for their song Test Me and have done TikTok dance challenges with idol groups. \n\nSome more (kinda random) group specific things outside of the XheroesXHoppipolla comparisons: \n- Onewe was on the idol show The Unit where they were competing to join an idol group and they are heavily associated and have collabs with idol group Oneus \n- I know solos aren\u2019t a reflection of the band but Woosung from The Rose\u2019s solo music leans more towards kpop (he also has choreo for Lazy) and so that\u2019s why I mostly think The Rose would be associated with Idol Bands\n\nEdit- to add to the appearances kind of thing, idol bands tend to do more music promotions for their comebacks, main example I notice is idol bands tend to have more appearances on music shows",

Hi-fi Un!corn are shaping up to be really, really good, so i\u2019d say they\u2019re one for you to watch.\n\nSmall thing tho, I wouldn\u2019t really recommend following ChoCo in any capacity. All of the members are literal children (the implications of this are obvious when you see their tiktok where only the vids featuring the girl does any numbers), and they\u2019re managed by Cho PD, a convicted fraud. He defrauded 2 of his previous idol groups and did time for it, and I guarantee he\u2019ll mistreat this one too. It\u2019s better to avoid the project entirely. The kids are all young and talented, they\u2019ll get other opportunities.",

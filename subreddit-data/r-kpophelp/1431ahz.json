    "postText": "Maki (17) from &amp;Team (Nov 2022 J-pop / K-pop boygroup under HYBE Japan) recently read a comment on a Weverse live with Taki (17) and Nicholas (20) that said \"Maki marry me\" and responded by holding his hands out like they were in handcuffs. Nicholas said \"No! Come on, he's still seventeen\" in English, and Taki said \"Stop!\". They laughed it off, but it was nice for me, as a fan, to see their reactions to a comment like that.\n\nAlmost every new group has members who are minors now, but I don't remember ever seeing older members defend the minors from people talking about them romantically / sexually. Don't they usually not say anything when these things happen? \n\nAre their any other groups who have done this for their members, or minor idols who have done it for themselves?",

Minjae (20) replied with [\u201cour average age is still 19.5 years old, it\u2019s not even over 20 yet!\u201d](https://twitter.com/410minjae/status/1656932489309622273?s=61&amp;t=l2Hkzlkmcxljk7YCLyJ0Hg). (the oldest members are 03 liners while the youngest members are 05 liners)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn another live, Yechan (17/18) read a comment that said \u201cmarry me\u201d. Hunter (17/18) responded saying [\u201cno, no, no. We\u2019re still young.\u201d](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSLY4s6ft/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI couldn\u2019t find the post/link for this one. iirc, there was a trend going on during that time, basically it was a way to ask someone for a kiss. A person tried that trend on Yechan and he replied with \u201cI\u2019m 19 years old\u201d (Korean age)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m glad they\u2019re not afraid to speak up against this stuff but I\u2019m concerned for them \ud83d\ude2d why do they keep getting comments like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: corrected some info",

Other examples of this kind of stuff happening that I can think of:\n\n* during an Enhypen live or something (I don't remember what it was, but it was recent), the members were reading comments/questions from fans that the staff had printed out, and one of the members, I think it was Sunghoon but I could be wrong, refused to show the younger members one of the questions and kept giving questioning and frustrated looks to the staff behind the camera.  Everyone believes it was because of an inappropriate question on the card that was directed at one of the younger members and he didn't want them to even see it.\n* I think someone here has already mentioned it, but there's a clip of Lesserafim saying no to Eunchae doing sexy concepts because she's still just 16.\n\nI'm sure it's happened before but I don't remember any more specific instances off the top of my head.",

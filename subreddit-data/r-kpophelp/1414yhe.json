    "postText": "Hi guys/fellow AROHAs,\n\nI recently came across this me&amp;me interview of MoonBin and saw that there were some lucky draw plushies and photocards for lucky fans who participated in the draw. \n\nJust curious if anyone knows how much the plushie and the photocards would sell? I was told the plushes would coat somewhere from 80-120 and the photocard in the 300plus range?\n\nIs this true?\n\nBelow are the link to the videos.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ab3OFHvBb0c\nhttps://youtu.be/ogPZKYHjdus",

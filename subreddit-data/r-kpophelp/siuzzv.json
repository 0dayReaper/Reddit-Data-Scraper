It makes me feel horrible every time I think about it because the girls really really deserved it. I know DC is getting traction and their company probably don't care much about music show wins since it's out of their hands, still, is 1 music show really that hard to give.",

                            "comment": "Bboom Bboom wasn\u2019t just the song though, before the song went viral, JooE went viral for [the way she danced with Hong Jin Young](https://youtu.be/Mi4eduKxLWg) which landed her [Tropicana ads](https://youtu.be/1hl0g7nupTQ). The ads became a meme of their own, they were used as a form of rickroll in the Korean gaming community. When Momoland started promoting for Bboom Bboom, JooE was put if the first time in her career [in the center](http://res.heraldm.com/phpwas/restmb_jhidxmake.php?idx=5&amp;simg=201804231510230583476_20180423151316_01.jpg) of promotions, even the center of the thumbnail in their MV. There was a lot of anticipation for this comeback outside of typical Kpop fandom because people wanted to see JooE being funny again. And the song delivered. The same people who shared the JooE meme would share the song too. \n\nThere was nothing to pull the general public to anticipate the Weki Meki comeback like that. And sadly, this is extremely common in Kpop, lots of songs that could get big get buried because there is no anticipation for them. For example, in my opinion, Love So Sweet was of the best songs last year, it was exactly what made me fall in love with Kpop back in the 2nd gen, but the song flopped. But people don\u2019t care about Cherry Bullet though, and FNC does not have a significant number company stans to keep it afloat.",

So yeah, they're not actually useful, but people in the industry can act really snobby about them, refuse to let groups without wins do things, and can have the company sort of just lose interest in the group as a whole. Pentagon is fully self-producing so they managed to float along for a while without one, bcs Cube didn't have to spend a lot of money outsourcing for albums and shit \\[also why Pentagon has 13 fucking mini-albums lmao\\]",

It was the song that actually got me into them. I was so impressed by the lyricism and theme that I thought it had to be one of the biggest songs in kpop. Though I guess everything happens for a reason. I feel like if it wasn't underrated we wouldn't have gotten Cheese, which is also a banger.",

    "postText": "I'm trying to find a female solo song for a cover but a lot of the dance practices show a heavy reliance on backing dancers for the choreography, which isn't ideal. I was just wondering if you could recommend some that don't do this, because I keep coming up at a loss. Any style is cool with me too, and the more visually or technically impressive the dance is, the better!",

Same goes for [Punk Right Now](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cbPIUnMsGyY&amp;pp=ygUNSHlveWVvbiBkYW5jZQ%3D%3D) by Hyo, which is also pretty impressive. Also [Free Somebody](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CfxB5gWPYhw&amp;pp=ygUSZnJlZSBzb21lYm9keSBsdW5h) by Luna. You can also check auditions for elimination shows for inspiration- Yujin from Kep1er/CLC did a cover of Hyuna's [Bubble Pop](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ7Wx61cRz4&amp;pp=ygUbYnViYmxlIHBvcCBnaXJscyBwbGFuZXQgOTk5) and Joohyun from Lightsum did a cover of BoA's [Valenti](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iwpydoKcavM&amp;pp=ygULVmFsZW50aSBib2E%3D)",

    "postText": "For Christmas (it's been a while I know) I got the Skz Lightstick, I've verified if it was an official one and it look like yes. I was so happy I wanted to try to turn it on. I took my batteries from my BTS Lightstick (which is working), inserted them inside the Skz Lightstick but it never turned on. I've trie multiple times with different batteries or batteries older but it never worked. I don't wanna wait for it to magically start working so I'm asking. What should I do?! \n(Sorry if there's any fault in my message I'm not english XD)",

    "postText": "After Jisoo absent and then now jennie due to health reason I've been wondering is it possible to request for partial refund? I mean like we kinda pay to see them, and if only 3 of em showed up shouldn't we get 1/4 of the money back? \n Ethically yes i should be more worried about their wellbeing but some of us save up for months just to see them. And do idols still get paid even they not performing? \n Just to clarify I didnt attend their japan or Melbourne concert, i just wondering, i couldn't imagine what I will feel if i spend 1 month of my salary just to know ros\u00e9 (my bias) not performing a day before the concert",

I don\u2019t know how it works in other countries specifically, but contract law is typically modeled the same or very similar. I have no idea if idols still get paid or not.",

Your money goes to the members, management, lighting technicians, price of the venue, equipment, various other staff, and multiple other things. \n\nSo if you were to receive a refund because one member was absent you AT BEST would get 5% of your money back. That\u2019s just a random guess because idk the breakdown for payment to all staff including the girls but you for sure wouldn\u2019t get 1/4 of your money back.",

You bought the ticket, then either just go to concert or you can sell it to other desperate fans who would pay for the ticket. \n\nMight get a lot of downvotes on this but if 1/4 members cannot even show up on stage (I have seen plenty of groups who have injured members just sit on stage and perform from a chair, which I guess works better for both idol to not feel guilty and fan to see their favs which they paid an obscene amount to see) then the groups should either postpone Or refund the tickets lol. Maybe just go and see them in any fashion show or airport lol",

    "postText": "This morning, 09/06/2023, a Music Business Worldwide article came out about how HYBE is currently raising a considerable amount of money with the aim of acquiring companies in Latin America. This news becomes even more interesting when we remember that just over two weeks ago we had the news that HYBE signed a contract with Tencent Music for content distribution in China, thus marking HYBE's entry into the Chinese market.\r  \n\r  \nBang Si-Hyuk, founder of HYBE HYBE, had already expressed interest in Latin America before, having already said in a recent interview for outdoor how K-pop should bet more on a Latin sound to reach a greater number of listeners, which it even makes me understand the choice of antigragil for the title of Le Sserafim. On the other hand, HYBE had previously expressed its lack of interest in the Chinese market, including how it had no interest in debuting idols from China, but apparently the huge number of album sales that its male groups (Seventeen, TXT, Enhypen ) has won in China in recent years has made them rethink the idea. Which makes you think that not even the biggest K-pop company today can afford to ignore the Chinese market.\r  \n\r  \nI believe that most K-pop fans today are aware of HYBE's rise story, starting with the former Big Hit, a company that came from nowhere but debuted the biggest K-pop group in history. From then on, it became an industry giant, acquiring multiple companies in different countries, reaching the point of not only opening an office in the US but also acquiring an American company, Ithaca Holdings. Currently, HYBE already has a base in the two largest music markets in the world, USA and Japan, having already debuted its own Japanese group and still having North American artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande in its catalog. And now they also intend to enter China and Latin America.\r  \n\r  \nI confess that at first I did not understand the choice of Latin America as the next market of interest for HYBE, after all, as stated above, the USA and Japan are the two largest music markets in the world, with China being the fifth and South Korea the 7. Now, UK, Germany, France are respectively the 3rd, 4th and 6th, and they are all European countries, so I imagined that Europe would be the next expansion market for K-pop, mainly with research stating about the growth of interest in K-pop in that region in recent years. But after reading the MBW article, the interest in Latin America became clearer. Apparently, this is a constantly growing market that should expand even more in the coming years, especially with regard to the digital music market. Recently we also had the launch of HYBE's first AI artist, Midnatt, who has his songs sung in 6 languages: Korean, Japanese, Chinese, English, Spanish and Vietnamese. This last one goes along with HYBE's previous lines about also being interested in debuting more SEA idols.\r  \n\r  \nIf we look at the market value of the 4 big K-pop companies currently, what we will find is the following:\r  \n\r  \nHYBE - $9.03 billion\r  \n\r  \nJYP - $3.35 billion\r  \n\r  \nSM - $1.84 billion\r  \n\r  \nYG - $1.17\r  \n\r  \nIt is clear to anyone that the difference between the HYBE and the Big 3 is enormous, far surpassing the value of all of them together. YG had a good result this year, mainly due to the BLACKPINK tour, but the difference between her and the others is still striking, apart from the fact that she recently had a new drop in the value of her shares after the news of G Dragon's departure from company, which in turn also sells the complete shutdown of Big Bang from YG. SM's performance is also far from the best. After all the time spent with the dispute for control of the company between HYBE and Kakao, SM seems to have left even more weakened than how it entered, and to make matters worse now they are having to deal with a lawsuit from 3 members of one of their groups most famous, which in turn was also reflected in a drop in the value of the company's shares, which were already below the amount paid by kakao for the acquisition. SM 3.0 so far doesn't seem to be even close to meeting the results that were promised at the beginning of the year.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, we have JYP, which has been showing itself as a company on the rise in recent years, having presented an impressive performance since the beginning of this year. The value of its shares went from 67,200 won in January this year to 131,200 won this morning, having reached a market value of 4 trillion won in mid-May, just one month after surpassing 3 trillion still in April, and currently being valued at 4.66 trillion. JYP is also being favored by foreign investors, who are buying its net shares at a price of 341 billion won. In comparison, the shares of other companies are being bought by the respective values \u200b\u200bof: 3.08 billion in HYBE, 158 billion in YG, 124 billion in SM.\r  \n\r  \nApparently, the reason why investors are interested in JYP is due to the growth in popularity of its 2 main groups, Stray Kids and TWICE, and the results that both have been showing in the biggest music markets in the world, especially Japan, China and the USA. Not randomly these are the 3 markets in which JYP has invested the most in recent years, having debuted a Chinese group, Boy Story, a Japanese group, NiziU. Last year, JYP officially opened its US office, which was born out of its partnership with Republic Records that started with TWICE signed with the American label in 2020 and later expanded with the other JYP groups also signed with RR. Now the two labels, RR and JYP, are working towards creating a group focused on the North American market. In addition, JYP plans to debut 3 male groups, one in Korea, one in Japan and one in China. Interestingly, JYP itself has already made it clear that after the North American group, their next project will be debuting a group in Latin America.\r  \n\r  \nIn this scenario, I pose the following question: do you believe in the possibility of some of the Big 3 companies being able to compete on an equal footing with HYBE in the near future? Or has HYBE already established itself in control of the South Korean music market and there is no longer any possibility of competition?\r  \n\r  \nAnd as for other companies: do you believe that JYP will be able to maintain its continued success in business? Would she be the only one capable of competing against HYBE? And SM and YG, is there any chance of recovery for these two companies?\r  \n\r  \nI would like to hear more opinion on the matter.",

Hybe do big acquisition and deals on different countries. while more of JYP done is much more better collaboration on the market they happen to do.  \nq1. do you believe in the possibility of some of the Big 3 companies being able to compete on an equal footing with HYBE in the near future? Or has HYBE already established itself in control of the South Korean music market and there is no longer any possibility of competition?  \n\r  \nA1. to me it will be for a long time for the big 3 companies on korea to follow in equal footing with HYBE in the near future.unless HYBE happen to do many bad investments and many fail big projects. and also if BTS happen to leave HYBE, that possibility can make it equal. but even if BTS happen to left HYBE, the influence is still there. and hybe already own many different artist that already have influence. to me HYBE have not really have much control on south korean music market, but they an influence on whole music market, control, maybe not. there will be posibility of competition but equal footing is not that much.  \r  \n\n\nq2.And as for other companies: do you believe that JYP will be able to maintain its continued success in business? Would she be the only one capable of competing against HYBE? And SM and YG, is there any chance of recovery for these two   \nA2. to me Hybe want to seen as Multinational music company, while JYP is more of Kpop Company that want to cater on different market. both have good goal. both have different step they will do. Hybe do big acquisition and deals on different countries. while more of JYP done is much more better collaboration and deals on the market they happen to do.   \n\n\nas a business graduate i love this kind of business talk.

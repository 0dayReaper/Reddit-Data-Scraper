    "postText": "I am making a playlist of the downright cringiest/most embarrassing/plain weird kpop songs, simply because I find them hilarious. I'm looking for any recommendations for songs that when they start playing around non-kpop friends you lunge for your phone to skip them.\n\nSome examples in my playlist already include:\n\nCat &amp; Dog - TXT\n\nWolf - EXO\n\nBilly Poco - Enhypen\n\nRookie - Red Velvet\n\nHmph! - WJSN Chocome\n\nAnpanman - BTS\n\nI Don't Like Your Girlfriend - Weki Meki\n\nI'm not focused on what type of music the songs are, what generation, boy vs girl groups etc. I just want stupid songs so that when I listen to this playlist it makes me laugh. I will say though, my absolute ult group is NCT so I'm definitely all for some seriously odd songs - do not hold back.\n\n Some people might disagree with the songs that I've listed, but they're just songs that cheer me up so much when I listen to them because I think they're hilarious.\n\nThank you in advance!!! &lt;3",

I'd add [Sexy Free and Single](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gWIkiI_UmeE&amp;pp=ygUUU2V4eSBmcmVlIGFuZCBzaW5nbGU%3D), [Bonamana](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tSOSxwEWFA4) and [Mr Simple](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r6TwzSGYycM&amp;pp=ygUJTXIgc2ltcGxl)\n\nAlso the classics that are [Ring Ding Dong](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=roughtzsCDI&amp;pp=ygUOUmluZyBkaW5nIGRvbmc%3D) and [Mazeltov](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lReJuxI7z-o&amp;pp=ygUITWF6ZWx0b3Y%3D), which never fails to make me laugh. And [Shut Up](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Iiikpj15i84&amp;pp=ygUOU2h1dCB1cCB1IGtpc3M%3D) by U-Kiss. Also [Keep Your Head Down](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=djJb5iSL0Do&amp;pp=ygUYS2VlcCB5b3VyIGhlYWQgZG93biB0dnhx) by TVXQ for Yunho's squeaky rap. Or [Beautiful Target](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zlruBjfjLtc&amp;pp=ygUVQmVhdXRpZnVsIHRhcmdldCBiMWE0) by B1A4, or [Twinkle Twinkle](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DWpl2CaCnVA) by Girl's Day.

To be honest, all of these are perfect - I added every single one to my playlist. Thank you so much!! :) &lt;3",

    "postText": "I know, odd request.  But I was watching Stayc's Sumin and Seiun YT video where they do ASMR content for like 20 minutes, and it was very calming. I know I've watched other groups do something similar before (RV in an early VLive/LieV) so I'm wondering of there are any must-watch ones that the community recommends. \n\nI requested girl groups specifically because their voices are more calming for me. It's also nice to just put on headphones and shut your eyes, which is the actual point of ASMR.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nUpdate: This was removed from kpopthoughts and reposted here per the moderators request.  Apologies if you already commented on the earlier post.",

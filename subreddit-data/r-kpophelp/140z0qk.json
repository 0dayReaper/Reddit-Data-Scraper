    "postText": "Hi!! I hope nobody takes this question the wrong way (I'm genuinely just curious).  I was wondering about any idols who started off their career and beginner/little to no proficiency in English and overtime vastly improved? I hear a lot about idols trying to improve and actively improving their English and I would love to see their growth and how much more confident they have become now. I know learning English is a process that takes years to fully perfect, and that expecting people like idols who are constantly busy to be peak perfection is wildly unrealistic. But there are some idols who just fricking Barbie who can do everything (ahem ahem i am looking at you jeon jungkook) and do it amazing every time, and some that are just generally swift learners . I am not referring to any idols who were already comfortable before said groups' debut !!",

While Itzy's debut coincided with Kpop's rise in popularity in the West. \n\nPlus Lia definitely helped other members improve as a fluent member. Twice's lack of fluent members made it difficult for them to improve their English. \n\nSame thing about other JYP groups: SKZ's Seungmin and Hyunjin improved a lot thanks to Bang Chan and Felix. Just as Nmixx's Haewon improved a lot thanks to Lily. \n\nThough I will say nowadays Nayeon is actively taking classes.

I think Xiaojun improved too but I don\u2019t follow him too much so I don\u2019t know to what extent. But I\u2019ve seen a live of him where he only spoke English without too much of a struggle. He\u2019s pretty funny when he does. \n\nHaechan from NCT\u2026ya, he understands a lot and will communicate even with limited vocab. He\u2019s witty in English too. I\u2019ve seen him reply in Korean to English questions on the spot before translators (I think at least). But he\u2019s one of those people that imo, didn\u2019t study. He just kind of absorbs and speaks. I\u2019m envious honestly. He\u2019s a fast learner and he has confidence to express himself even if it\u2019s not going to be perfect. I can\u2019t imagine how good he would be if he actually studied. \n\nHe\u2019s not as good at Taeyong or Xiaojun tho. I\u2019m just envious of how much he knows of English and improved without studying (AFAIK).",

But it really doesn\u2019t do much for the kids in most countries unless the country itself uses a lot of English (India and Hong Kong for example and some European countries. Altho I heard things are changing in Hong Kong). \n\nGuangdong, I would say most people don\u2019t know English. The younger kids probably know some very basic sentences. Like replying to questions like what\u2019s your name, how old are you? And so on. definitely not enough to hold a conversation. Lots of parents place their kids in English speaking kindergarten and it literally does nothing except extreme basic stuff. \n\nBut there are always going to be a small percentage who can speak it enough or speak conversationally or very proficiently.",

Changbin used to be completely quiet during English interviews, even during Maxident era he would barely speak, but this comeback he's correcting both Seungmin and Chan's English during interviews, which is pretty funny but also shows huge progress on his part. \n\nAs an aside learning a foreign language is super hard, especially as an adult, so honestly shoutout to all idols trying to learn English or Japanese or any language. Even if they're not fluent the effort is definitely appreciated because again, IT'S HARD.",

Han seems close to fluent and has his own personality in his speaking which shows me how comfortable he is. The other members did well too!

LMAO tomoons told him anyway, \n\nhe's still maybe just low conversational but admits it is hard because he is the type to figure out what he's saying *while* talking but even with that i think he's doing very well all things considered. and coming from someone just casually learning korean as adult...yeah it's hard to learn another language. i'm like that. i know my own language so well and can phrase things in just the right way to convey what i want  but i'm not at the \"think in another language\" stage yet",

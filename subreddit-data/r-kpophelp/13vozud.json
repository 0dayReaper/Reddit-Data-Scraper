    "postText": "I pre-ordered a five star Stray Kids album from HMV and because I pre-ordered the limited ver. there is multiple things that should be in the album but I\u2019ve just read because of import laws there won\u2019t be photo cards in the album. Is that true? Can anyone explain this to me? This is my first K-pop comeback and all the things I\u2019ve seen are contradicting each other.",

            "comment": "IIRC it's more to do with gambling laws, since photo cards in a way promote gambling. Which is why when BLACKPNK released The Album through UK distributors the 4 limited versions had predetermined photocards.  So Ver 1 always had the same cards as did versions 2, 3 &amp; 4. \n\nBut since 90% of the KPOP releases through HMV are just imports and not domestic releases (such as BLACKPINK having a UK distributor) it should be fine.",

HMV themselves would've had to import them, so I don't see why they wouldn't be included when they are in store-bought ones?\n\nEdited to add that I've just checked the HMV website and it states there that photocards are included so they'd have to be otherwise it's false advertising.",

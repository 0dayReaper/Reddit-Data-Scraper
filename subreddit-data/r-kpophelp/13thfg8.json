TOP has quite a few vocal lines in the MADE album: Let\u2019s Not Fall in Love, Loser, Girlfriend, etc. \n\nIn the Stand Up EP, he wrote A Good Man, where he is also singing in. There\u2019s quite a few tracks you\u2019ll hear him singing. \n\nDespite being one of the main rappers in BIGBANG, he does his fair share of vocals and brings a nice contrast with his deep voice.",

You also have the song Ex which everyone sings.\n\nIf you want to see Han Jisung singing his lungs out I recommend you watch Stray Kids\u2019 performance of I\u2019ll Be Your Man / \uae30\ub3c4 by BTOB on Kingdom.",

He has an amazing talent for doing open voice. \n\nBigbang- Gdragon \n\nBTS- Jhope can sing exceptionally well and does ALOT of backing vocals on tracks both of BTS and his solo work. Recently, Suga took vocal lessons and on new album, as well as on his tour, has been singing. \n\nSeventeen- iirc, all the rappers can also sing",

[BYE BYE](https://youtu.be/DgYax563zAo) has no rap section and she gets a decent amount of lines (even the bridge). She has posted vocal covers before and is considered the all rounder of the group as she's also their main dancer. Also in their [Last Christmas cover](https://youtu.be/ik4QgKYOOQg) she sings a fair amount as well.",

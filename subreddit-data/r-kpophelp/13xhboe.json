            "comment": "If you were referring to [these baseball jerseys](https://jypj-store.com/en/collections/twice-official-goods/products/tw23-wts-0058), they were Japanese tour merch that did have a restock that unfortunately ended yesterday/day before. Most of the time Japanese merch, just like most Japanese this, is sold specifically to that market. Even when buying from their official store, if you are trying to buy goods internationally, you need to go through a freight forwarder; their store uses Buyee.\n\nYou might be able to find them for resale at a relatively reasonable price because it\u2019s recent unlike other tour merch.",

I was going to suggest JapanHomeMaker as the go to to buy them, but it seems like they\u2019ve closed down the Japan tour merch page sadly.  I got all of the jerseys from them and they are my go to for merch from Japan because it\u2019s so easy to buy from them and I don\u2019t need to sign up for a proxy or deal with how slow and unfriendly the JYP checkout process is.",

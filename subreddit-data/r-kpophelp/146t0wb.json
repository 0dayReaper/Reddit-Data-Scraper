I think it helps if you can narrow down the commonalities of the songs that you enjoy for better recommendations.\n\nNonetheless, LE SSERAFIM as I think some of their recent songs have similar vibes to Blue Blood (Fire in the Belly) and Shine on Me (FEARNOT). Also bonus that they have Kkura and Chaewon (and even Yunjin) linked to Yujin and Wony from IVE, can pick out the IZ*ONE interactions and absolutely lose your shit over it.\n\nIU is quite irreplaceable, as a uaena myself. I personally feel her discography is large enough for me to enjoy all her songs though, but if you're into R&amp;B, some soloists I enjoy are BIBI, Baek Yerin and Seori.",

(fml, going seventeen, teen age, semicolon and your choice for example!) \n\nim also a huge fan of DVWN. he's a soloist and songwriter under koz ent. which is a subsidiary of hybe if im not wrong. he wrote songs for shinee, gfriend, kang daniel and more! i would say he's more an indie / krnb singer but tbh i don't have that much knowledge with musical terms.. \n- some songs i recommend are fairy, phobia, last, insomnia and no problem!!",

It\u2019s really hard for me to suggest songs because I love all their songs (well minus bet you wanna with cardi b).    Maybe start with Shutdown and Boombayah.

For recommendations, I\u2019ll give you different styles. Wannabe, Surf, Voltage (Japanese single), b[oo]m-boxx, snowy.",

Some more songs from them I recommend, Lullaby, Shy Shy, Miss ping pong, One &amp; Only, and The Aerialist.\n\nMonsta X have an incredibly diverse discography but I would suggest starting with their album The clan part 1 &lt;Lost&gt; and their all English album All about Luv. For songs I would suggest, Flavors of love, Deny, It\u2019s alright, Bebe, All I do and Need u. \nAlso one of the members of Monsta X just had a comeback and his albums is called Lights, I would suggest his song don\u2019t worry be happy and \ub3c5\ubc31(monologue).\nHope this helped!!",

While their title tracks are great, checking out their b-sides is well worth it.\n\n* [Dingo Killing Voice](https://youtu.be/Iwdq3NtpeFQ) is a good introduction to them.\n\nThey also did a YT short doing an acapella snippet of [IVE's I AM](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4I_1XkBxprs).\n\nThey are gaining some international awareness after appearing on Kingdom: Legendary War with a sub-unit made of their active members who were not in military service. They remade some of their songs and did a cover of a Stray Kids song\n\n* [Missing You - Theatre Version](https://youtu.be/Sa7u3kWeq3s)\n* [Back Door (Stray Kids)](https://youtu.be/bQGSugQTXQA)\n* [Blue Moon - Cinema Version](https://youtu.be/bQGSugQTXQA)",

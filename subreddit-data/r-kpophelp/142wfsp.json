Hyundo was the group's producer.\n- Ivy's \"Tempting Sonata\" samples Beethoven's \"F\u00fcr Elise\".\n- G-Idle's \"Nxde\" and Park Jiyoon's \"Song of the Moonlight\" sample Georges Bizet's \"Habanera\".\n- SHINee's \"Good Evening\" samples 112's \"Cupid\".\n\n[A small compilation of Korean songs that sample classical music](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cxwnnclISy4)\n\nFun fact, Lil Wayne's \"Original Silence\" contains a sample of a classic Korean song, \"Forget-Me-Not\" by Cho Yongpil.",

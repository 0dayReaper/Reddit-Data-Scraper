            "comment": "If you're OK with kwanga lore then aespa's Black Mamba - Next Level - Savage - Girls - Welcome to My World tell a story through their lyrics. [Black Mamba](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1YUGlb71FE8&amp;pp=ygURQmxhY2sgbWFtYmEgbHJ1Y3M%3D) sets the scene introducing the characters, [Next Level](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dly3BvtmXbA&amp;pp=ygURTmV4dCBsZXZlbCBseXJpY3M%3D) is about them following Naevis to Kwangya, [Savage](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HdOdEQcVBDA&amp;pp=ygUNU2F2YWdlIGx5cmljcw%3D%3D) and [Girls](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=INjrEeXeAbY&amp;pp=ygUSR2lybHMgYWVzcGEgbHlyaWNz) are about them fighting Black Mamba. They use the bridges of each song to introduce new ideas, so the bridge of Next Level has Naevis' warnings about the dangers of Kwangya/Black Mamba, Savage's bridge is about Naevis sacrifices herself, Girls bridge is about Naevis moving to the real world, and [Welcome to My World](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lEyBNjhgiKc&amp;pp=ygUaV2VsY29tZSB0byBteSB3b3JsZCBseXJpY3M%3D) continues the tale of her in the real world. I get that this sort of thing definitely isn't for everyone but I actually like aespa's lyrics because of this, there's an actual story being told over several songs.\n\nFor more conventional ones, [After School](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jm21Flj-dHE&amp;pp=ygUbYWZ0ZXIgc2Nob29sIGx5cmljcyB3ZWVla2x5) by weeekly is about finishing school for the evening and rushing off to hang out with your friends in the sunset, and marvelling about how connected they feel in that ephemeral moment, I think the lyrics are really nice and tell a little story. AKMU lyrics can be quite story-like too - [Dinosaur](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WNp_XLCOTBw&amp;pp=ygUURGlub3NhdXIgYWttdSBseXJpY3M%3D), [Anyway](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDvOuPCP29w&amp;pp=ygULQW55d2F5IGFrbXU%3D), [Hair Part](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wbcN9CvRF6M&amp;pp=ygUOQWttdSBoYWlyIHBhcnQ%3D) all tell little stories. [Remember Forever](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7cVnMcFBlBc&amp;pp=ygUicmVtZW1iZXIgZm9yZXZlciByZWQgdmVsdmV0IGx5cmljcw%3D%3D) by Red Velvet has nice lyrics too, as does [The Fifth Season](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=klMIr6Cw3mQ&amp;pp=ygUXVGhlIGZpZnRoIHNlYXNvbiBseXJpY3M%3D) by Oh My Girl. Sunny Hill often had good lyrics too, [Darling of All Hearts](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vem8C11eyVs&amp;pp=ygUcRGFybGluZyBvZiBhbGwgaGVhcnRzIGx5cmljcw%3D%3D) is about feeling lonely and then coming to terms with that by the end of the song, [Midnight Circus](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=giZkILz16Do&amp;pp=ygUWTWlkbmlnaHQgY2lyY3VzIGx5cmljcw%3D%3D) about being trapped as a puppet, [The Grasshopper Song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KYMUlyvDF-k&amp;pp=ygUmVGhlIGdyYXNzaG9wcGVyIHNvbmcgbHlyaWNzIHN1bm55IGJpbGw%3D) about being stuck in the rat race/not enjoying life.",

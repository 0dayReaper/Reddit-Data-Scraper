I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people that like them both (on tiktok) but i haven\u2019t heard any discussions involving both of them at the same time..\n\nIm currently drawing a piece that consists of Taeyong drawn in green w/ his stand \u201chierophant green\u201d simply because it\u2019s also green too\ud83d\udc80which made me think\u2026\ud83e\udd14\n\n\u201cAre there any NCT members (any unit) that would have a specific stand matching them\u2026\u201d \n\nIve come up w/ colours that represent some of the members to try to match it to a stand w/ the same colours. For example, Renjun\nbeing Yellow. However, most yellow stands don\u2019t really match his vibe\u2026\n\nI was thinking should i go for matching vibes w/ the members and the stands OR should i pair them together based on their colour\u2026both are equally hard imo\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\n\nAny ideas?",

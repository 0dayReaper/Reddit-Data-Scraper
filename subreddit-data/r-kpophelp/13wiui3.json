Many kpop companies sign contracts with Japanese labels which has the connections and expertise to organise shows in Japan.\n\nOther than that, the infrastructure in Japan is just well-organised. It's so easy for a fan from anywhere in Japan to attend a concert. They just need to join the fanclub, ballot for a ticket, pay for it. On the day of the show, there's plenty of public transport options to get to the venue, and get home. For fans who are from out of town, there's cheap business hotels they can book for one night. \n\nI'm not from the US so I'm not exactly sure how it works but based on what I see on reddit and twitter, you guys have to worry about parking and hotels and whatever else, not to mention ticketmaster and dynamic pricing. It's just a lot of hurdles for fans in the US compared to Japan, I suppose.",

Prevents for 'oh I'm not going to those seats for that price' mindsets, and definitely helps selling out venues even better than in mainland Korea.",

But even small standing venues have \"seats\" numbers dictating the order of entrance into to venue so there's no need to camp in front for hours(/days) before apart from going on site to buy goods (when they are sold in advance, which is often the case in bigger venues). Staff will call numbers in order and will check the ticket seat numbers in any venue regardless of size.",

Often there are many tiers and can range from $60 to $500, before dynamic pricing even comes into play. This automatically eliminates people\n2. Locations. Getting around Japan is far easier and less expensive than in USA. It can cost hundreds or even up to a thousand dollars just to travel round trip. It can sometimes cost less to go out of the country to Mexico or Canada depending on where you are located.\n3. Time off. Time off can mean no money for people. Also some people don't have much time off. Or their jobs can be at risk, so time off can also be considered an expense.",

If you don't live close to the venue, traveling becomes a huge, expensive ordeal which just isn't feasible for many fans. Japan is smaller so concert venues are easier to get to if you have to travel out of town for one.\n\nWe also have a huge scalper problem which makes it difficult to get tickets for face value and many fans are not willing or able to pay exorbitant resale prices.\n\nAnother factor to note is that, a group may be playing in 2 or 3 cities in Japan vs. 8 cities in the US, so the distribution of a fandom across 8 cities is going to result in a smaller number of concertgoers in a venue.",

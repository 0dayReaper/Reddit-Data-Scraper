Its not uncommon to see kpop idol trainees who are elementary school kids.",

            "comment": "&gt;untalented normies\n\nWell, two things:\n\n1. Training. Companies with good trainee programs can shape anyone up into a premium performer. Some companies like YGE actually let their trainees \"compete\" for a slot in a group like with Pink Punk (now Blackpink) and Baby Monster, because competition can motivate trainees to develop.\n2. Those normies they scout aren't exactly untalented. If you meet the minimum visual and fitness requirements, you can at least be trained in singing and dancing. That's why you do not see out of shape normies get scouted. And even the worst dancer or singer in the group aren't exactly *the* worst dancer or singer out of it. Big Bang's TOP is the group's worst dancer, but he still dances miles better than me.",

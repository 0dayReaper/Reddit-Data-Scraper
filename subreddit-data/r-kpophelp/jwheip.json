Tell me which song is it for you?\n\n For me, has to be Psycho (RV). I cannot explain how much I loved it when I heard for the first time. The song aged like fine wine.\n\nTell me about yours?",

I'm a 2nd gen fan who gradually stopped following K-pop because my fave groups were either starting to have lesser activities, lose members, or disband. But now I even started stanning younger groups like GOT7 and SKZ, after following K-pop again, thanks to that one song.",

            "comment": "\"Psycho\" by Red Velvet for me, too! I stayed up for the release and I loved it when I first heard it, but I didn't expect their promoting to be cut short due to Wendy's unfortunate injuries. I was looking forward to their performances on music shows and, better yet, the encore stages. Imagine just how great their vocals, especially Wendy's, would be during the encore stages. It's just too great of a song not to be promoted. It deserves to win Song of the Year at MAMA 2020, although I doubt it has a chance since MAMA seems to be more of a popularity contest.\n\nI'm glad to know someone else appreciates the song as much as I do. I've been listening to it the whole year.\n\nEdit: \"DDU-DU DDU-DU\" by BLACKPINK is another one. I loved it the very first time I heard it, but I should have paid more attention to what I was doing, where exactly I was, etc. The song has sentimental value to me because it came out when I was traveling in one of my favorite places, so it would be great to relive that again. Music has the power to connect to me, where I am, what I'm doing as I'm listening to it, and my progression in life, so it means a lot to look back when I listened to a great song for the first time. Anyway, I didn't mean for it to get this deep, but I just wanted to share a bit of my perspective.",

You also have to understand that expectations were at rock bottom since Wolf was the song they released right before. And the one take music video was really impressive.  There's definitely a reason why that song put EXO on the map.\nAnd definitely a mention to the acapella section in Tempo. I was shocked and amazed when I heard that the first time.\n\nThe other one is Bad Boy by Red Velvet. I was waiting for a straight up R&amp;B title track from Red Velvet for so long. That song just feels good.\n\nAnd Superhuman by NCT 127. It still is my number one song in terms of the song production. And the stacked harmonies are no joke. I wish I could experience that build up to the final chorus with Taeil and Haechan's highnotes again for the first time. It's not as impactful when you know that it's coming.\n\nObviously I like SM groups lol. It's the R&amp;B and vocals that get me everytime.",

With every early listen, there's more to unveil whether it's the instrumental or hidden vocals. But I've listened to their songs so much that everything seems normal now. I want to go back to when I discovered all the minute details in each song and felt excited by them.",

I am a 2nd gen stan after all and it was my intro to kpop, so there were a lot of things that I was hearing for the first time.\n\nLucifer for a variety of reasons. Sentimentally, this is the song that got me into kpop. I had literally never heard anything like it at the time and it was a mindblowing, lifechanging experience. The song still holds up too tbh, it's a kpop classic.\n\nf(x)'s Airplane is another. For sentimental reasons, this is the song that really sold me on f(x). The song's very dreamy and ethereal and gorgeous, a pop masterpiece tbh. And Sulli's first part in that song, the pre-chorus part, is just so, so beautiful. I remember being blown away the first time I heard that part. I still get goosebumps.\n\nI by Taeyeon. I remember the first time I listened to it, I got chills. I still do tbh. Taeyeon has the voice of a generation tbh, I can't sing her enough praise. And there's something downright magical about how the song opens.\n\nGonna throw one more in there, but Beast's Fiction is such a fantastic song. I don't think Beast gets enough credit for how great their discography is. I think Fiction is some of Shinsadong Tiger's best work.\n\nAnd for a non-2nd gen artist, there are so many songs from LOONA, between their group stuff, predebut solo &amp; sub-unit stuff, that I couldn't possibly pick only one. A standout one for me is Egoist though.",

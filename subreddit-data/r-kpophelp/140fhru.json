BlackSwan is a reincarnation of the old group Rania, who were so mismanaged that the entire lineup changed about four different times. BlackSwan\u2019s lineup has changed a number of times as well and there was a scandal about a year ago where a member who\u2019s not in the group anymore got caught saying/ being racist online towards her black bandmate, but otherwise the group itself is clean. All the drama is with their label.\n\nPeople just don\u2019t know what to make of them. Nobody in the group right now is Korean although they certainly train and promote like all other Kpop groups, so they\u2019re kind of an anomaly. But they\u2019re not actively hated as far as I know.",

Using your example, no Korean is going to feel any significant camaraderie with the Japanese based solely on the fact that they're both \"Asian\" unless they're specifically dealing with the vestiges of the said European imperialist bullshit (ex: when both are targets of racism by white people). I'm using the term \"ethnicity\" for lack of better word, but how the English world view race v. Ethnicity do not fit how Koreans see themselves (i.e. \"minjok\").\n\n\"Culture\" doesn't really fit the \ubbfc\uc871 label either as it lacks the phenotype/genetic factor that the \"Korean identity\" definitely includes as of now - if Korean identity really completely overlaps with what the English language labels as \"culture\", the society should have no problem with seeing \ud63c\ud608\uc778s or people who are not Korean citizens/were not Korean citizen at birth as \"Korean\" who otherwise is culturally consistent with an average Korean.  And that's clearly not the case - see: Jonathan/Patricia Yiombi.\n\nIn other words, \"ethnicity\" (i.e. minjok) and \"culture\" are different in this particular context.  Kpop is a product of \"culture\" - \"ethnicity\" has no bearing on it as long as the end product is culturally consistent w/ the Korean \"cultural identity\" (i.e. - language, history, preferred melodies/bars, vocal styles, chord progression, etc.)",

Companies first and foremost focus on the korean audience and intl audience second, always. That's never gonna stop happening, like be forreal.\n\nPeople complaining about the fact that kpop groups are promoting overseas and gaining international success are mad over nothing. How does a genre of music gaining international fame taking away the korean-ness? They wanna gatekeep I get it but that's not how it works, kpop companies are making millions off of intl success and they are entitled to promoting intl fans too. \n\nXG has all the right to say they aren't kpop, they aren't singing in korean they are meant to be a global girl group singing in english. Them not wanting to be kpop and people giving them hate for that simply need to face the fact that a girl group being fully japanese-korean have the right to make their own genre of music. From what I see, they aren't denying to be kpop because they hate identifying as korean or japanese, it's literally just not their branding or the music they are making. \n\nRegarding blackswan, I'm talking about how people intentionally hate on the group, calling it not kpop BECAUSE it has a black girl, SEA girl, girls with darker skin tones and of different races. It's the reasoning and motivation behind the hate and behind them saying it's not kpop. \n\nFrom what I can see, korean fans just can't accept the fact that kpop as a genre shouldn't be gatekept whether they like it or not.",

The only people who label them as kpop are people who see that they are an all japanese-korean group and automatically assume they are kpop because they \"look\" like one. Again, these people generally get corrected by others. \n\nYou fail to state the reason as to why koreans don't wanna label blackswan as kpop. They train under a korean company, sing in korean, the music is under the genre of kpop. Now tell me why koreans don't wanna label them as kpop, tell me why koreans reject them as kpop. Oh wait I might as well answer that myself, xenophobia? Different race?",

People think they are kpop because they either don't know any better or are confused, especially with how popular kpop is atm. You're so pressed about this point when I dont even care what they get labeled as at the end of the day, seems like the koreans do though so they might as well write that letter for you hun.\n\n The point is there is, in fact, racism when koreans reject that blackswan is kpop. Even for rania the previous group, people still rejected it as kpop and also there were korean members of the group in the past. That didn't stop people from getting heated saying it's not kpop. Even when koreans reject them as kpop saying there aren't korean members, that's still a reason with xenophobic and racist intentions even when they don't realize it. They are just objectively kpop, they make kpop music, sing in korean, and do kpop style promotions.",

They sing in korean making it korean pop music, which is kpop. The group objectively makes korean pop music, what is hard to understand. They don't make cpop or american pop, they make kpop music. Koreans stay pressed that in order to be a kpop group you have to have koreans in it but that's just not true, a group can have all chinese members but all of them trained under jyp or sm and debuted singing korean pop music, promoting in korea. They are still a kpop group because of that fact, they wouldn't be cpop just because they are chinese. What makes this hard for you to understand. Change that to whatever background the blackswan girls are from and it would still be the same.",

Then all of a sudden there are all these videos cropping up on YouTube of member Sriya meeting Korean teens.  Perhaps somebody at DR entertainment is trying something different?",

They were pretty silent and laying kinda low (besides some performances) after the Leia drama up until the new member program was revealed and the new lineup was announced which was about a year and a half give or take.\n\n&gt;!Also although this group is essentially a retool of Rania, they're pretty disconnected from them at this point. Their debut album was literally called \"Goodbye Rania\", the only member from the Rania line up (officially debuted; Youngheun and Leia were in Rania but never released a song before the group became BlackSwan) left right after debut and Fatou currently is the only original member of BlackSwan (the company never said Leia left but most people just consider her gone at this point). This paragraph is a bit of a side tangent but I think we can stop attaching the legacy of Rania to them and call BlackSwan their own group now. The new album doesn't even sound like anything Rania would've put out, even Close To Me ventures from what they were like sonically. The only really \"Rania-like\" song they have is their debut and that was 3 years and two whole lineups ago.!&lt;",

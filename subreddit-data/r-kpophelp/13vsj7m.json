    "postText": "Hello everyone :)\n\nI kindly ask for you help for my master's thesis research on the impact of experiential marketing in the music industry with the example of SEVENTEEN.\n\nIf you attended or streamed SEVENTEEN's 7th Fan Meeting \"SEVENTEEN in CARAT LAND\" from March 10th to 12th 2023, or/and had the change to visit SEVENTEEN CAFE in SEOUL between May 4th and 28th 2023, I'd love to hear about your experiences! \ud83e\udd70\n\nBy participating in this only survey, you can contribute valuable insight to my study and help me get my degree (Let's make Seungcheol proud \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc). The questionnaire includes 42 multiple-choice questions for each event, which you can rate on a Likert-scale ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\". Additionally, there are 9 demographic questions to help me better understand your background. It will only take around 5 minutes of your time!\n\nAlso, rest assured, your responses will be completely anonymous and treated with utmost confidentiality! I strictly adhere to the guidelines set by the General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), and your participation will be secured through an encrypted data connection.\n\nThe survey and more information about it can be found here: [https://survey.questionstar.com/2dc88d33](https://survey.questionstar.com/2dc88d33)Or the twitter thread:[here](https://twitter.com/intoxicated_kss/status/1663138918408105986?s=20)\n\nThank you in advance for you valubale participation in this survey! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf89\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest regards\n\nChrissie",

Sorry to bring it up at all, and I don\u2019t have an issue with plastic surgery or his choices or anyone else\u2019s, I\u2019m just obsessed with his original nose. The Cutest Nose.\n\nSeventeen\u2019s Dokyeom, the literal love of my life\u2014 the way he *crinkles* when he smiles real big and his smile is so pretty and his nose is Perfect and the way his eyes sparkle (when you can see them!!)\n\nThe Boyz Hyunjae: again, the LOVE OF MY LIFE, Perfect nose, and his eyes and his smile and [blabbers on for a good 45 minutes minimum]\n\nBOTH Yunhos (TVXQ and Ateez), baby Yunho stole my heart away the minute I laid eyes on him, and I\u2019ve loved DILF Yunho for years, handsomest man in kpop for sure. \n\nDay6: Young K, he takes my breath away, especially when he\u2019s happily eating away, (this is not a kink thing, pls don\u2019t think that \ud83d\ude2d), he just looks SO RADIANT AND HAPPY AND HIS CHEEKS ARE SO CUTE also whenever he looks a little confused/slow blinks\n\nStray Kids Jisung and Chan. Jisung is so pretty it hurts my feelings and Chan, my main man, I know I\u2019ve mentioned nearly everybody\u2019s nose, but HIS NOSE\u2014 the Single Greatest Nose Ever. I just want to kiss it. he\u2019s also just stupid pretty, especially when he smiles. \n\nMoonbin. *Moonbin.*\n\nEdit: NOT ME WRITING A FULL ON ESSAY COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE IM AN EMBARRASSING HOMOSEXUAL",

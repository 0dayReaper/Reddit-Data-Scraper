Cause wow I can't believe a rookie group can stay this long in the hot 100 and chart high too ! Plus they are eligible for the Grammy's and there is chance they can win isn't it insane ?",

It\u2019s peak on the Hot 100 is still only 17 (which is amazing for what was an unknown group at the time). Gangnam style peaked at 2, and probably would\u2019ve been #1 if billboard had actually counted digital metrics properly at that point in time",

At least it does where I live, since I\u2019m in the greater Toronto area.\n\nI\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised to hear it in malls every now and then. I could\u2019ve sworn it was on the radio once, but I could be wrong. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a huge, Gangnam Style esque hit though. I\u2019d compare it to a lesser known artist who released a liked, but not rabidly obsessively popular song. \n\nAn example I\u2019m thinking of is 2002 by Anne Marie; the song was popular on TikTok, and the singer isn\u2019t a nobody per se, but not on the Katy Perry or Demi Lovato level of famous. 2002 was played a fair amount on radios and public places, but not enough to be considered the song of the year or anything. \n\nI\u2019d say that Butter by BTS is closer to the level of popular that you\u2019re asking about. And Butter wasn\u2018t a Gangnam Style type of hit either. It was just played often enough that people recognized it, which I don\u2019t think Fifty Fifty has.",

Technically any is eligible for a Grammy so it\u2019s not like they met a certain success critiera or threshold to be eligible. But they should definitely still submit for consideration. There chances are probably the same as any artist that got a modest hit this year\u2026a toss-up!\n\nNote: This is all based on location.

One of the prompts was a love heart with an arrow in it and one of the players who is a 50 yo dad/boomer of the group answered the prompt with \"50/50, Cupid\" and when everyone questioned him about it, he was like: \"It's Cupid! Like the song you know? It's kpop! It's Fifty Fifty!\"\n\nThat to me was really unexpected, cause out of all people he's a dude that doesn't even know Pokemon or most pop culture references in general.",

I mean realistically, everyone here needs to realize for a song to stay on the hot 100, it needs to be played which may not be happening where some of you guys live, but it is happening and these girls are having a MAJOR break through. Like this is a really big achievement for a rookie girl group and I hope we all can realize and support that as they join known artists like BTS and BLACKPINK on that chart and how played they are in just casual buildings in everyday life, like this is huge for them. As for the Grammy\u2019s, any song or whatever can be registered, and as they are right now trending on social media platforms and out and about in stores and everything, they definitely should at least try!",

Also, Gangnam Style was an inescapable global sensation, like everyone knew it just because of how fun, weird and crazy it was. Cupid's success is huge from a Kpop fan's perspective, but for everyone else it's just another popular song at the moment.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Cupid will climb even higher and truly become mainstream (good luck to them!) but as of now I doubt they'll win a Grammy either. Because even if it got nominated, it'd most likely be going up against songs from already well-established, non-Asian artists like Calm Down, Flowers, Kill Bill, Antihero, etc...",

I don't think it even had youtube gaming/music split either so it was EVERYWHERE. Im pretty sure back then it had trending as a top 10 too so it was insane and gangnam style peaked that for a while.\n\nIt was the first vid to reach 1 billion views, not just for the music like cupid as well it spread because of the novelty of the vid, meme status, being from korea making it a crazy outsider thing, honestly spread like fire. edit: Omg i forgot, youtube back then was basically parodytube, EVERYTHING had a parody and gangnam style had at least a thousand BIG youtuber parodies it was a weird time to say the least. It being low hanging fruit for content and youtube being a song parody machine at the time = EASY clap for the virality\n\nAs for how it got big in korea first to start it, I'm sure theres a whole side to that story we wouldnt have known.\n\nAs for cupid, the trending cycle has just gotten far shorter because of shorts and tiktok, its still crazy big but doesn't have some of the features gangnam style had for it to be able to spread through memes, funny dances for kids to do in school etc.",

            "comment": "No it is not everywhere like Gangnam style and Psy himself were. Gangnam style and Psy were EVERYWHERE and the caps are needed to capture how much it became a part of American pop culture for a time. Football players danced it during their end zone celebrations.  People danced it numerous in sport events.  Psy showed up on late night shows.  He was on SNL. I think he may have even been on the Simpsons. He also performed Gangnam style on the today show, an American morning news show. It was all over place.  I got sick of it. That is how much it was all over place.  There\u2019s no comparison. I don\u2019t think any kpop song has reach the level of Gangnam style. \n\nI know Cupid is popular. I have heard it on the radio in the Bay Area (after the radio push) but I have not heard it anywhere else.  Regardless, I acknowledge its popularity.  However, fifty-fifty has not been invited to perform it on the late night shows.  That\u2019s the next hurdle.  They can still get invited.  The morning news show is a tough hurdle. Again all of this can still happen.  These are just reference points.  As of right now, the answer to your question is no, Cupid is not everywhere like Gangnam style was in 2012.",

Cupid is more of a ballad slower sounding song so I don\u2019t think it would it be played \u201ceverywhere\u201d in the US.",

My son says he hears it mostly on YouTube shorts or Tiktok.\n\nIt's no where near Gangnam Style level since I still hear that one on occasion. \n\nCupid is a cute enough song but it's kind of boring in my opinion. It would be good background music for a movie or tv show so give it time.",

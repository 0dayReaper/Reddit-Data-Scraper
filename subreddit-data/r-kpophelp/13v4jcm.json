    "postText": "Does anyone have a giant scary kpop music spreadsheet with columns for at least song title, group/artist, and producer/composer/arranger (as relevant)? \n\nI want to do some analysis of my preferences and see if there are trends in the people writing the songs (not lyrics). I've been taking forever to make one myself based on my spotify playlists, but I just realized that while this may give me some surface-level data, it won't help me that much since I won't be able to compare my preferences with all of the things that I \\*don't\\* like so much. \n\nBut it's loads of work to make something like that, so if anyone is also a spreadsheet monkey and can help, please let me know!\n\n(P.S. If anyone is curious, my current suspicion is that for girls' music especially I tend to prefer scandinavian composers and arrangers. I'm having more trouble with figuring out my preferences for guys, because I'm finding little overlap. It doesn't help that some groups, like the edenary team with dreamcatcher and ateez, all have their names on all of the songs, so there are effectively no conclusions I can draw between the songs I like and the songs I don't for those artists.)",

                    "comment": "hahah, thank you, i appreciate that! my favorite dreamcatcher songs are deja vu, new days, wake up, break the wall, mayday, tension, and beauty full. \n\nIn terms of ateez, my favorites are treasure, my way, hala hala, promise, wonderland, dazzling light, sunrise, answer, fever, dreamers, new world, and deja vu. I also often prefer the instrumentation/mixing on Ateez' japanese versions of songs, which is often very subtly different from the original versions.\n\nGenerally I think I tend towards more conventional western pop sound at mid-tempo with a focus on melodic rather than percussive sound, but I frankly would need a lot more music knowledge to have much luck figuring out with any nuance what makes me like some songs more than others.",

(Testing a theory)",

I didn't know genre analyzers existed lmao.\n\nBasically though I would try to find songs within the same genre of what you like. My suspicion is that you probably already do this somewhat (like other artists / songs you like will overlap).",

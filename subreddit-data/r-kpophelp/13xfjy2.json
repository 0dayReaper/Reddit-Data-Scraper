That's why it's good to know if you feel comfortable trading only within your country or worldwide as worldwide is more expensive.\n\nIf you are buying then you cover postage. They should have stated either in their post or in dms how much it would have been up front.\n\nFlash video is making sure you take a good quality video with flash showing if there is any fine marks that may not be picked up without light.\n\nPacking proof is when they send you an image of your purchase or trade with your address in the same picture. You say if it's correct or not and then they'll send. They should send you a video of them sending it out.",

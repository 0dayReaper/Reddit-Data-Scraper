            "comment": "My personal and (in my opinion, very helpful) tip is: take earbuds with you and put them in your ears during the concert!\nThe frequencies in concert halls usually overlap and are so high that the idols\u2018 voices sound very shrill and high pitched, not very enjoyable to listen to. But earbuds filter those high overlapped pitches, which makes their voices sound much clearer and you can hear the music way better. Also, the screaming of fans around you doesn\u2018t hurt in your ears as much. \nI\u2018ve taken earbuds to quite many kpop concerts by now and honestly I don\u2018t regret a single second of it!\nHave fun at the concert!!",

            "comment": "excited for you! i've been to an i-dle concert in Atlanta in the past, and the girls are awesome so i know you'll enjoy it. \n\nfirst tip, make sure to check your venue's rules on what you can/can't bring! there's always going to be metal detectors and screening before you enter so it's best to bring only necessities. also check if it's a clear bag policy or not since that's a big one.\n\nsecond tip, if you're not going to be in general admission or don't care about merch, then you can arrive at the venue around 10-15 minutes before the concert starts to save yourself the line since you already reserved your seat with your ticket. how quickly merch sells out varies, but for reference i was at an nct dream concert and stood in line an hour before doors opened and was able to be close to the front of the merch line and get what i wanted. \n\nthird tip, have fun! whether you want to record or not is up to you, but i personally don't. i record clips or parts of songs and take pictures but i like to be complete immersed. don't be afraid to sing along and scream (when appropriate ofc) and let loose!! the people sitting next to you or standing behind you in line will be your best friends during the concert. don't be afraid to talk to them!\n\nthat's all i can think of at the moment. lmk if you have any q's. i hope you enjoy the concert!!",

                            "comment": "imo, yes! at the nct dream concert, i was able to buy a lightstick and batteries when lining up an hour in advance :) i remember i-dle's merch line at atlanta wasn't super long, but since i didn't get anything i'm not sure if they sold out by the time i got there (i didn't stand early that time). the venue they performed at back then was quite small, so i doubt they ran out. \n\nat nct dream, there was a lot of people standing in line in front of the venue even when i went an hour earlier, but they ended up splitting the line since it got so long. it depends on how big your venue is because at the nct dream concert, there were multiple merch locations (and i think at the i-dle concert i went to there was only one). the venue *should* have something on their website about merch locations and exits/entrances on a map so check that out.",

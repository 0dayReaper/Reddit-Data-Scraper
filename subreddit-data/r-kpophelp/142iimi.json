    "postText": "So i've been wanting to get into kpop but i can't find a sound that i like tho. I can't escape that edm sound like, every time i try to find a group its edm or some form of it and i cant take it \ud83d\ude2d. theres no way all kpop is just that one specific sound so i was hoping you guys could help me out. If it helps, i listen to a lot of  r&amp;b so an r&amp;b-esque group (or just 1 specific album i really don't mind). But I really just desire a more tame sound in comparison to the edm that i find myself coming across a lot so it doesn't HAVE to be similar to r&amp;b, just anything thats not edm or edm influenced.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all your recommendations, I feel like it\u2019d be kinda weird if I just left a dry thank you under every comment so I figured \nI\u2019d just address it here. Again, thanks!\n\nEdit 2: I was a bit busy yesterday so I didn't get the chance to listen to much, but I enjoyed GOT7's flight log album (or EP i forgot), i tried a little bit of irris, as well as some dreamcatcher. I also took it upon myself to revisit one of the only songs that i liked before to day, Loona's Hi High. I plan to listen to more today so i will continue to give updates.",

EXO, SHINee, 2PM, MBLAQ, SS501, B2ST, M.I.B., 2NE1, Brown Eyed Girls, ZION T, Jay Park, Day 6, CN Blue, Trax, Dong Bang Shin Ki, Big Bang pre 2012.  \n\nThere is a ton of music outside of the popular groups that make amazing music.  From 20, Hello Gloom, Woodz, WooSung, Yoon Mi Rae.\n\nLook at the youtube channel 1thek, they showcase a lot of non mainstream kpop or korean music that you won't hear otherwise.  r/Nugutown as well.",

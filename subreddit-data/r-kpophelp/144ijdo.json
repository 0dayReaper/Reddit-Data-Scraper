    "postText": "I've been adding new songs to my playlist and I found this song by Dreamnote called GHOST and I was so shocked of how good it is and I never heard anyone talking about it.\nSo what I'm asking is specifically songs with dark vibes, not just lyrically but also musically by underrated or nugu groups, some that I heard recently and made me go crazy are:                                                                        \n\n\u2022GHOST -Dreamnote                                                                       \n\u2022Karma -Pixy                                                                      \n\u2022Villain -Pixy                                                                      \n\u2022Breath -Pixy                                                                      \n\nBtw these songs are the only ones I listened from these 2 groups so even other of their songs are completely fine as long as they have the same concept/vibes/style.\nAnother group with similar vibes is Purple Kiss, but I already stan them.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that Dreamcatcher is my favorite group so I already know all of their amazing songs",

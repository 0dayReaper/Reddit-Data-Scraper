    "postText": "I joined a group order for an album back in December and it's been sat at their k-addy since January - I sent a DM over 8 weeks ago (both Twitter and Instagram) asking if there were any updates but they haven't even read the message. I don't mind waiting and understand that if everyone sends messages it would be quite time consuming to reply, but the lack of any communication at all is frustrating as this is my first time with this GOM so I can't even be confident it will ever arrive (also their form literally said \"if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me\" lol and they even noted down my version preferences wrong).\n\nI've joined a number of different group orders for albums in the past but never had this experience - would it be reasonable to ask for a refund at this point, or should I just be more patient? Any thoughts would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Unfortunately this is common with a lot of GO managers where they either accept too many orders/spend a lot of time sorting and then kind of just forget about the albums or slowly send them out. To give credit where credit is due, large GO managers are probably crying themselves to sleep with inclusion sorting and mailing out but 6 months is definitely a bit of a long wait.\n\nI've had this happen to me before and yeah- it sucks, but hopefully your albums get to you soon \ud83d\ude2d",

Hopefully I'm wrong though and the albums do turn up eventually lol thank you \ud83d\ude2d",

And they're not reading and responding to your messages?\n\nIf that's the case, after 6 months I'd be considering going nuclear - start commenting on the posts that you want an either an update, your order or your money back immediately or you'll be looking into legal options.",

Usually after a few weeks they would get in contact to sort shipping but obviously there's been no contact at all, so I've followed up for updates but they haven't read any of the messages. \n\nI think I'll send a more direct message/comment and see if it gets me anywhere, because I never anticipated I would still be waiting for some kind of contact 6 months later.",

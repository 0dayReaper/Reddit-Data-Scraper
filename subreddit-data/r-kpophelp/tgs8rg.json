People think that Jiwon swore during [this Chivalry performance](https://youtu.be/1k_BO5KUBUE) because he \"wanted to get banned to have a break.\" and afterwards that they were banned for 2 months.\n\nI've literally never heard any Korean source claim this. According to the namuwiki, no one even realised he swore until years later. And on that, there are multiple instances of both Jiwon and Sunghoon swearing during songs. Like it makes no sense.\n\nSechskies had their first when with Chivalry- why would they throw that away? Getting \"banned\" from one show wouldn't give them a break anyway. \n\nMy personal opinion is that he did it to show they weren't lipsynching. In almost all songs done with live microphones they add random adlibs- whether it's Sunghoon singing \"Lalalala~\" or changing the lyrics of Road Fighter to an unreleased English version.\n\nI don't know it just grinds my gears.\n\nAlso another one is that two members of K'pop (the boy band lol) were gay.\n\nActually anything non 1st gen fans say about 1st gen generally has no source or is just exaggerated. \ud83d\ude10",

He was abusive to his ex girlfriend who was Chinese, He was caught rubbing himself to a member of Itzy (when honestly, he just look like he was itching himself lol), the list goes on and on. The worst part is people on TikTok; Twitter, and even Reddit tore anyone to shreds even if they mentioned Woojin in a Neutral light, and said \u201chey, a lot of these accusations don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d I remember one post someone did where they posted a twitter thread about how Woojin was possibly innocent and everyone basically said \u201cI\u2019m not believing some random twitter thread\u201d when this whole thing started over a twitter thread. People didn\u2019t want to look at it logistically, even after the documentary came out people didn\u2019t want to admit that they were wrong so they got defensive over the documentary. \n\nPeople kept saying \u201cWell Bangchan said he hurt the group\u201d but that could mean an abundance of things. Even when Kpop members of groups just simply leave, they always say the same thing, \u201cthat they hurt the group\u201d. It\u2019s kind of shitty to just assume the worst off of what one member said that didn\u2019t even allude to anything specific. \n\nLogistically, why would JYP as a company wish him well in his future endeavors afterwards if he had done a lot of the accused things??",

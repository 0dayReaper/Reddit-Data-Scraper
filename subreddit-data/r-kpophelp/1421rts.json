    "postText": "it must be so immersion breaking to go from being able to understand the lyrics to hearing random english phrases. and what makes it worse is that 90% of kpop songs out there have english lines in them. i just wonder if the knetz have an opinion about this sort of thing or if im overthinking it.",

            "comment": "no, most don't particularly mind it. however, i've seen groups like gfriend and lovelyz being praised by korean fans for barely using english in their title tracks. so, although most fans are okay with there being some english words as it's pretty common and honestly everyone's used to it by now, when a group puts out a song that has no english in it, the fact that it's fully in korean is often something korean fans will praise, as that's quite rare when it comes to kpop songs.",

I\u2019m a Spanish speaker and it doesn\u2019t sound immersion breaking or weird when a Spanish speaking singer throws in an English line (which happens a lot too). Same when an English speaking artist throws in a foreign word on the song. As long as it\u2019s not done awkwardly which does happen sometimes, but it\u2019s not inherently strange",

I guess in that case it just depends on the fandom",

It's clearly intentional, so it must have been during the original Hallyu Wave. \n\nI'd imagine SK fans are fine with it since they all learn English on school. But for me, the appeal is actually not understanding the words because the sentiment is still felt through the music and vibe (US fan, btw). I wonder how SK fans feel about it as well.",

There would be a little phrase here and there and with the rise in popularity globally idols who didn't speak Korean would work in English and as the years went by they got better in English.  2PM and 2NE1 are two that come to mind that brought more English lyrics in.\n\n*Beyonce Beyonce...I'm walking out of destiny.

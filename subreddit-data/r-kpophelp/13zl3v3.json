Idk how a song could sound like it but something refreshing(?), like when I listen to this song, I imagine myself opening the car window, putting my head outside, and feeling the wind. Like a song that just makes you feel free, I honestly have no idea how to describe it, but if someone understands, please tell me a song like all eyes on me, I really love it",

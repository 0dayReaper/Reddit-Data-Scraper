    "postText": "Hello, basically as the title says! I was just listening to WayV and then I was struck with a simple question. Since China bans performances from korean artists (I think the ban still stands) can WayV perform in China?? I mean they are group based in China but they are under SM aka korean company, so what is the answer. Hehe thank you!",

The label is called Label V, hence why WayV has a different name than the other subunits (NCT 127, NCT Dream, NCT U). WayV was originally going to be NCT V, however they had to change it do to the label change. So they are still a part SM, but technically perform under a Chinese label that SM created!",

All kpop fans knew obviously but there was enough plausible deniability for chinese authorities to look the other way if it was going to be an issue. We did not have true confirmation that yangyang, hendery, and xiaojun were actually a part of nct until the nct 2020 project (the others were in previous nct releases but that was before wayv was announced). \n\nHonestly the only reason Wayv exists as its current line up is because koreans were banned from Chinese media. Like the original version of wayv was meant to debut in 2016 with the other two units and included johnny and doyoung (why they were added to 127 late) along with ten and kun and a rookie that never debuted named hansol. People also speculate that Lucas and Jungwoo were part of that line up as they were both a part of SM at the time but were not official revealed rookies as that would bring the line up to 7 members as all NCT units including the eventual wayv debuted with 7 members.",

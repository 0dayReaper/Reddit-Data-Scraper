            "comment": "She slowly gain, popularity on variety shows and a couple of acting gigs, but she ultimately blew up through advertisement. Around that time she was considered to be one of the girls in K-Pop with one of the best figures. She was one of those girls that people thought she had godly proportions. Honestly, there was so many rumors that her body was photo shopped to the point they literally brought out a cardboard stand of her on a variety show, and she stood next to it in the exact same outfit and there was literally no change. Actually skyrocketed in that advertisement the phone was off the hook for her and she was continuously working advertisement deals, variety, shows, acting, and AOA was consistently coming back. \n\nAlso, during this time of her blow up, AOA was dropping sexy hit after sexy hit. So with her gaining popularity individually, it also did help the group. Unfortunately, the group did have a scandal for being ignorant about Korean history. I don\u2019t remember the exact details of the scandal because it was a long time ago, but it really did hurt the group and the good luck comeback.",

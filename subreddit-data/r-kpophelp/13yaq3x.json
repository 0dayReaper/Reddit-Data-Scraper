    "postText": "I hope this is ok to post here, since as stated in the title I am looking for a specific non kpop song; however, the only lead I have is that it is similar to Fromis\\_9's We Go. Every time I here the chorus of We Go, specifically the \"Come with me now\" lyric, I am reminded of another song, but I cannot for the life of my figure out what it is. I think it is probably from the 2010s, and possibly the theme song to a TV show? I can't remember any lyrics or parts from it though, other than the connection to the chorus of We Go.  \nI know this isn't much to go off and I apologize if it doesn't belong in this reddit, but this has been bugging me for two years now and I would love to get an answer. Thanks in advance for any help :)",

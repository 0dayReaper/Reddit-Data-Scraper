            "comment": "New jeans songs are popular, seems like everyone knows OMG and Ditto. Love Dive by Ive also, can\u2019t escape it on TikTok. G-idle has a lot of good stuff, Queen Card, My bag, Nude, oh my god, etc. As a huge Mamamoo fan basically any song they have I recommend, but these days my favorites are Illella, Starry Night, and Paint Me. Also can\u2019t really go wrong with anything by IU. AKMU is also great, Nakka and How people move are my favs. Seventeen has a lot of good songs, Hot, Super, Cheers, Left and Right, My my, etc. \n\nIf you move a little closer to the hip hop/indie sides of Korean music, I recommend: \n- Bolo by Penomeco\n- Love me, Limousine, and Bad Love all by Be\u2019o\n- Summer by Paul Blanco\n- Travel, Some, and We Loved, all by Bbol4.",

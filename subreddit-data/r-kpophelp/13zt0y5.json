It's just personal preference... some people only like cute concepts and some like a \"sexier\" concept (though being sexy isn't necessarily the point of girl crush). I have many male friends who like the groups I mentioned, but in general I feel like my friends enjoy both cute and girl crush...",

Compared to, say, innocent/cute concepts or mature/sexy concepts, Girl Crush appealed to a lot female fans hence the name. Sonically, the songs were more bombastic and in your face. Ex: 2NE1 - I Am The Best, 4Minute - Crazy, CLC - Hobgoblin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore recent groups, the sound kinda morphed from bombastic to kinda noisy (for some songs). Heavy into the EDM. Ex: Weeekly - Ven Para, EVERGLOW, Blackpink, Secret Number, Lapillus, LOONA - So What, LOONA - PTT, Kep1er - WA DA DA.",

            "comment": "group-wise it's basically having a cool badass image. some ggs with a girls crush concept as the group's image would be 2ne1, 4minute and Blackpink. they were pretty much the first few groups to have this concept to represent the whole group's image that i can think off. \n\nnow discography wise, it's having a cool &amp; confident concept, it's p much the same thing- having a badass concept, often sexy too. some ggs with albums/songs of this concept would be Twice's Ooh-Aah, Everglow's Adios, CLC's Black dress and Red Velvet's Be natural. these are just few examples.\n\nand lastly idol-wise it's basically a female idol who's more tomboy-ish or yk has the charm to attract other girls. Like Moonbyul from Mamamoo, or Amber Liu former f(x) member. Twice's Jeongyeon also had that image for a long time with her short hair.",

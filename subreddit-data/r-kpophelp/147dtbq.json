I've gone to BTS's show at SoFi but all I needed to do was put my seat info into the app. Is there an actual app for the new Candybong, or do I have to go to a pairing booth the day of the concert?",

You just need to hold the power button for a few seconds and it pairs. I think that's the same for the Candybong Z as well. If other venues have that, then it should be the same.",

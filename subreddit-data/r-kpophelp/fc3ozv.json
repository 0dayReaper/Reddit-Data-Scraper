    "postText": "Most fans are absolutely lovely and not crazy but there are some that are horrid. Like in a way they make me ashamed to be a kpop fan or like anything Korean since some people have this notation now that anyone who likes that stuff is either crazy or a koreaboo. I sometimes purposely hide that I like kpop, kdramas or even have crushes on some Korean actors since I don't want people to make fun of me or think I'm one of those crazy fans. I'm planning on studying there for maybe up to a year and I've already got a friend there. I just hate how sensitive the Stans and SJW's are lmao.\n\nEdit: didn't expect this post to blow up but thanks you for all the comments! I'm glad I'm not alone in this. \n\n(PS I hate Twitter and I always will)",

(And this goes for all multis, not just Army-multis) That being said tho, bigger fandoms will have more toxic people, it's sadly a given. Once I stepped off social media and enjoyed Kpop more offline like through streaming music and watching YouTube videos etc, it was more relaxing. Going on Twitter/Instagram etc every so often for more updates and videos is why I stay on there, but it shouldn't take up the majority of anyones time. (Btw listening to one Kpop group is fine, it's not like they only listen to that group. They probably listen to other artists outside of Kpop.)",

When I explain further they start to understand, it's basically like being into sports but if the sport was being a pop star, but even then they ALL think I like BTS. (fwiw I have a few songs but I am a hardcore GG stan only)\n\nNobody has thought I am a crazy fan, but I have had my own first hand experiences with them enough to not blame anyone if they did think that. For example, people were mad at Gugudan Sejeong for her bad impression of Twice Momo and the psychos on twitter were wishing Sejeong harm and calling her all sorts of mean names and swear words. So I said everyone should chill, and if they are offended then spend their energy focusing on building Momo up instead of tearing Sejeong down. I was then called a wh\\*re and told to kill myself and all sorts of stuff.\n\nSo if someone would think I'm one of those people, I am quick to dismiss that suspicion because I openly talk about how I struggle with the psycho fans even tho I also like kpop.",

The other part of the problem is the people around you that would make fun of you for liking kpop. You can\u2019t control the behavior of masses of fans. But the response of the people around you, that part you have a more direct influence over. So show them you\u2019re not a toxic fan. Like \u201cHello, I am an example of a non toxic fan.\u201d Haha I think what you said about only talking about kpop with other kpop fans is kind of how it goes as you get older. For me liking kpop is like a tier 3 friendship level thing. I don\u2019t tell people if it doesn\u2019t come up. And even among people who know, most prob don\u2019t know how much I like it. I\u2019m not purposely hiding it, but it doesn\u2019t come up. \n\nIf your friends don\u2019t like to talk about it, find friends who do. And see if your other friends are still friends for other reasons. People may think other people\u2019s hobbies are lame.  But you like what you like. And I think in general people will care less about policing other people\u2019s hobbies as you get older.",

Being older than the average is (sadly) one of the reasons why I hesitate to follow newer groups.

I was like \ud83d\ude44 ugh god damnit. \n\nFast forward to now and I can\u2019t even post anything in the Loona thread because you say anything besides how perfect they are and how perfect everything is going.

A recent event was when [V's passport and personal info were leaked](https://twitter.com/koreaboo/status/1240265447481708545?s=21) by a YouTuber. Armies took the fight to Twitter, trying to track down who did that to V. Now the Army doesn't seem scary at all.",

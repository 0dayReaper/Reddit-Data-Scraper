    "postText": "Rocky left on 03/01, and it\u2019s only been a few months from that. I know the reasons are not being released. Anyone has any clue on why he left? I know he was in a dating rumor, but barely anyone cares about idols dating nowadays, I doubt that was the reason he left. He obviously loves his members. Now Binnie is with the stars. Astro needs a main dancer. They can carry on with the group much better with Rocky in it. It must have been a difficult decision cuz the way Fantagio was wording it like Rocky is no longer an Astro member, meaning he had to leave everything behind. Even tho fans still think OT6 as one. Anyone knows if he has signed with a new agency yet? What are the chances of him getting back to the group? I would love to hear some insights.",

            "comment": "he left after his contract expired, the dating was most likely not the problem as this was months before contract expiration, and he doesnt have a dating ban or anything. he has left the group officially, and we dont know what the full reason was. \n\nhe's a former member of astro as of right now, astro could pull a KARA and have former members in an anniversary release, but i doubt he'll come back suddenly after signing with another company.",

He\u2019s given so much of his life to fanta (14 years? 7 or so with astro officially?) he likely left because they could no longer give what he needed from them. Its good for him honestly. But no matter what the company says, he is always part of astro and always astro member. He will always be close to them.",

He hasn\u2019t been seen since Moonbin\u2019s passing, and his letter at the memorial sounded incredibly sad, so I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019ll be up for proceeding with whatever performance plans he had anytime soon. \n\nOverall, my guess is Rocky would participate in an anniversary activity or memorial performance for Bin - so long as Fantagio lets him, and they BETTER. But seeing as Fantagio failed to protect him from stalker fans mad at his gf and TOTALLY failed at protecting Bin, there is absolutely no reason for him to return to that company just to be with Astro during their military phase.",

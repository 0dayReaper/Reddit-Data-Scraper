    "postText": "Since Soojin was  proven not guilty of bullying in her trial back in 2020, almost all international kpop fans seem to agree that she is innocent. But since she has kept up the radio silence despite lots of support and love from neverlands and non neverlands alike, I can't help but to wonder how knetz feel and if they are stopping her from being in the public eye?\n\nI know that Korean fans take bullying scandals very seriously and from what I remember of the scandal knetz were out for blood when it came to her. (Especially compared to other male idols' scandals like Mingyu and Hyunjin's where it just blew over). So I was just wondering if knetz have now forgiven her and/or are as desperate for her comeback like us international fans are?",

            "comment": "No. The way Cube and Soojin herself reacted when the allegations first surfaced was enough to turn the public's support away from her, and when Soojin claimed that she never spoke to Shinae, the latter refuted by saying, \"She's right, because it was a *one-sided insult*\", i.e. she openly insulted Shinae, not directly in her face, but enough for her to hear or notice. The GP interpreted this as a \"half-truth\" situation where Soojin purposefully said she never spoke to Shinae because it's the truth, and left out the fact that she did insult or criticize Shinae.\n\nIf anyone has the right to forgive Soojin, it's her (alleged?) victims, not the 3rd parties like the netizens. And they don't need to forgive her, either.\n\nETA: 2021 was full of high-profile people getting accused of school bullying, not just Soojin and Hyunjin but also sports stars (sisters Lee Jaeyoung and Lee Dayoung, both volleyball players, getting accused of bullying was the catalyst that started the whole thing), actors, numerous other singers, and idol group members.

It\u2019s not conducted by a system that has any evidence rules or experience in truth finding. It\u2019s not equivalent to a legal case. Fans tend to put a lot of trust in those kind of report\u2019s despite them having a history of being misused by bullies to further victimized their victims. \ud83c\udf38\n\nAlso I think soojin lawyer revealed that the SVC deemed her innocent. \n\nThe problem is that often if the report seems an idol guilty, people take it as gospel. While when it reveals someone as innocent people don\u2019t believe it and demand for a court case. (I\u2019m not saying you are, just something I have seen in general with fans)",

They don't have rules regarding how they decide who is right, and the system is extremely prone to abuse and inequities based on income or status. So I would be cautious in trusting the report to document *what happened*. The documentation is so poor that a booming legal industry is dedicated to reversing them.\n\nIt is very clear how poor this process is when you read Garam's document. They don't follow up or question any of the statements. They do not check to see if the person has a consistent story or any corroboration. They also do not have a transparent decision making process. The school violence system should not exist because it does not adequately protect the children's presumption of innocence and is a punishing institution disguised as a bullying intervention.\n\nEdit: So I find the statement, unless there is a school violence report, it is all hearsay to be inaccurate because the SVR is just school employees writing down hearsay.",

That is why it is used so much by bullies. It is very easy to manipulate. You can make stuff up, and now you have \"documentation\" of it happening, which can ruin the person's life. A screenshot of a person telling another person an incident happened is also evidence to an extent, but both the picture and the \"report\" are prone to manipulation and inaccuracies.\n\nPeople underestimate how bad the SV system is at doing what it is intended to do.\n\nI get your point tho. I just don't think it is fair to bring up the report in the context of legal innocence vs guilt, particularly in Garam's case.",

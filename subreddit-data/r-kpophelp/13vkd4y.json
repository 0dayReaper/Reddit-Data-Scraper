It never even made it to the general sale. \n2. All fanclub tickets require you to show ID/passport and fanclub ID, which means you can't buy someone else's ticket.\n3. Third party resellers can refund their own tickets and transfer it to other people so that the ticket appears in your name, but the last time I checked, the prices were about $600-700 per ticket in Seoul.",

    "postText": "Hello K-Pop fans! I thoroughly enjoy reading this group. I have some questions about K-Pop culture, fandom, and music that I hope you can answer for me. You see, I am a music journalist. I have recently begun examining the phenomenon of K-Pop music in the United States. Some of the questions below may read as \u201charsh\u201d to you. But I assure you that they are posted with genuine curiosity and a desire to understand the strong following that groups like Twice, BTS, and Blackpink are gaining in the United States. This is for informational purposes only and nobody will be directly quoted in anything. This is just for my knowledge/research.  \n1\u2013Why do K-Pop groups have such strong followings to them as people? What is it about the parasocial relationship that generates such strong engagement between artist and fan?  \n2\u2013What is the difference between a \u201cshowcase\u201d tour and a \u201cconcert\u201d tour?  I recently saw NMIXX, and they said \u201cWe hope to see you next time not at a showcase, but at a concert!\u201d What is the difference?  \n3\u2013 Off of number two, why are tours numbered in such complex ways? I.e. \u201cTwice 4th World Tour III\u201d What do those numbers represent?  \n4\u2013Why do K-Pop groups spend large amounts of time between their music talking at the audience? It disrupts the flow and Americans are not as used to constant breaks in a setlist. Also, there is a penchant to say \u201cWe are now going to say hi to you! We can\u2019t wait to say hi to you! Let\u2019s start saying hi now.\u201d Which seems to add more time than just launching into, \u201cHi and welcome to the show.\u201d Again, it feels like there is something cultural here that I am not understanding.  \n5\u2013Do K-Pop groups lip-sync to English tracks recorded by American singers when touring in English-speaking countries? The most obvious example that I am suspect of is Twice. The girls have perfect diction in their English tracks, but need a translator to speak. I ask this without any bias one way or the other. But if it ever comes out that JYP or other firms are hiring alternative singers for the vocals of various groups, it could lead to the downfall of K-Pop in the U.S. (Millennials and Gen Z\u2019ers, please Google \u201cMilli Vanilli.\u201d)  \n6\u2013Do you believe the Korean Idol system is morally acceptable? And if so, why?  \n7\u2013Are you OK with your favorite K-Pop bands using tracks, and lip-syncing in order to focus on dancing and being physically entertaining? At that same NMIXX show, a track with vocals started while the girls were talking. Would you rather they used bands and sang live? For example, Twice is using a full band in the U.S. for the first time on their current tour.",

            "comment": "I'm not gonna answer all your questions but a few of them. \n\n2) A showcase is meant to just show off the group, perform a few songs, and build up a fanbase. The showcase tour is meant to draw hype towards the group and allow them to meet fans when they don't have enough songs for a full tour. A concert is just a concert. \n\n3) Not all tours have complex names. This was twice's 4th world tour. The tour name is III. They just combined the fact it is their fourth time going on a world tour with the tour name. \n\n4) The talking segments allow them to take a break in between songs and relax for a few moments. They need to drink water and take a few seconds to breath. They happen at the beginning of the concert. The middle of the concert. And right before the end. There isn't that much talking in comparison to the amount of times they spend singing. It also doesn't help your example is from a showcase where most segments are meant for them to talk to fans and play fun games. Actual concerts operate differently. \n\n5) Most groups are not lip-syncing English. The thing is they don't know how to talk in English but they can emulate the sounds of English words. It's how K-pop fans can sing along with the songs but not actually know what they are singing. You learn how the word sounds and mimic it. You don't need to know what a word means in order to phonetically sound it out.",

What is it about the parasocial relationship that generates such strong engagement between artist and fan?*\n\nIt's the same with Western celebrities... you like them, you admire them, you become a fan. Not all fans have that parasocial \"oh we're friends and we have a connection\" type of thing going on. Some really just like that group's music and message and decide to support them.\n\n*4\u2013Why do K-Pop groups spend large amounts of time between their music talking at the audience? It disrupts the flow and Americans are not as used to constant breaks in a setlist. Also, there is a penchant to say \u201cWe are now going to say hi to you! We can\u2019t wait to say hi to you!

If it's not the full group does the talk, those off-stage have the time to change costumes. The whole spiel of aegyo and fan service is to buy time.\n\n\"It disrupts the flow and Americans are not as used to constant breaks in a setlist\" bothered me for a second, I'm so sorry. I've been to concerts of US acts that talked as much as foreign acts, if not more and much cornier, and it's not really a huge issue. Also, more often than not, the flow of the US leg of their concerts follows the direction of their Seoul dates, down to what they planned to say. They say even more at their Seoul concerts since they speak Korean then have a memorized (or via prompter) script for their US shows. Even the English-speaker of the group follows a confirmed script and rarely goes out of it for time purposes. I've been to four Big Bang concerts and they stick to the script every single time. And when I watch the Korea concert DVDs, it follows the same sequence.\n\n*5\u2013Do K-Pop groups lip-sync to English tracks recorded by American singers when touring in English-speaking countries? The most obvious example that I am suspect of is Twice. The girls have perfect diction in their English tracks, but need a translator to speak. I ask this without any bias one way or the other. But if it ever comes out that JYP or other firms are hiring alternative singers for the vocals of various groups, it could lead to the downfall of K-Pop in the U.S. (Millennials and Gen Z\u2019ers, please Google \u201cMilli Vanilli.\u201d)*\n\nSame way how English-speakers are able to sing along with Korean songs. They can work on mimicking the words without fully understanding what they mean. And of course, some really do lip lynch but to their own recorded voice. The sound director can choose to alter the recording or have the artist do it over and over until they got it perfect.\n\n*6\u2013Do you believe the Korean Idol system is morally acceptable? And if so, why?*\n\nIt's cruel and unfair. But the thing is, these kids are willing to go through it for a small smidge of fame. I have conflicting feelings about the idol industry. It's not a healthy place to be.\n\n*7\u2013Are you OK with your favorite K-Pop bands using tracks, and lip-syncing in order to focus on dancing and being physically entertaining? At that same NMIXX show, a track with vocals started while the girls were talking. Would you rather they used bands and sang live? For example, Twice is using a full band in the U.S. for the first time on their current tour.*\n\nI am HUGE on vocals and I almost immediately lose interest when I catch anyone - K-pop or otherwise - lip synching. But that's just me. Almost all of my favorite groups are more vocal-leaning than visual. I'm not saying they're automatically bad. I'm just extremely picky LOL. I'm okay with using instrumental tracks and the occasional MR but to me, singing live is the absolute BARE MINIMUM for this occupation. Their training should allow them the ability to both sing AND dance well and at the same time. I've been to Japanese concerts with full live bands and those are AMAZING. But if the group has to use recorded backing tracks, that's okay too. No lip synch though. I didn't pay $xxx for that.",

                            "comment": "*if you acknowledge the Idol system as unfair, why patronize the KPop genre at all?*\n\nThis is where I'm most conflicted. I'm not confident that I can put my thoughts in words properly but I'll try. On the one hand, there are absolute horror stories of training, diets, exploitation, and even loss of life. Sure, not EVERY SINGLE idol goes through the extreme but they'd be lying if they said everything is sunshine and roses. On the other hand, they still chose to go through it because they have a DREAM. Now as a fan, my dilemma is I want to support their dreams but that also means feeding the beast that is the K-pop industry. I can't really do all that much; I can't physically clean their dorms for them or prevent them from unhealthy diets. The most fans can do, to be truly blunt, is spend money on them. \n\nThis all made sense in my head. I'm sorry if it's all over the place. I'm willing to discuss more. I'm always up for civil conversation.\n\n*But with KPop it seems especially extemporaneous. Especially with the repetitive nature of some of the talking breaks.*\n\nBottom line, the talking breaks or \"ment\" are to give the artist *a break*. To give them time to catch their breath, take a sip of water, dry off the sweat, maybe sit down, and most of all, look out at the crowd and appreciate the audience. They're focused on their singing and dancing that sometimes, they don't see the crowd. They can't take their in-ears out to *hear* the cheering. These breaks give them that opportunity. \n\nYes, they can get repetitive but consider the fact that they don't speak much English. Even their staff might not have a native speaker on the team. Having a pre-written script that is simple enough for them to follow and remember is probably the most that they can do. And what else really can you talk about? These ment can give them a chance to look cute and interact even a little bit. Believe me, K-pop fans don't mind this segment at all. :)\n\nActually, it's not just these non-English speakers. I went to an Epik High concert, the one before this last tour, and in every single stop, Tablo (who is a native English speaker, Canadian) had pretty much the same spiel every single tour stop. I think it's more for convenience. It's one less thing they have to worry about.",

There are many who really want this. They may not have asked for the dark side of K-pop - these kids could've had a very glamorous image of the industry - only to get burned when they actually break in.  And the companies can also spin a sob story to add to the appeal. We may never know the whole truth.\n\nThere are enough stories out there along the lines of \"I've always wanted to be a singer\" or \"This is the only thing I wanted to do\". They grind, go agency hopping, fail so many auditions, but still keep going. There's also the nepo babies who may or may not want the life their parents had but are forced to ride that wave.\n\nI'm aware of what happened with LOONA, similar to what went down with BAP during my heyday with K-pop. I can't really justify or explain what happened or how I, as a fan, could have avoided that from happening. I think you sort of answered your own question, \"Can we support the artists freedom without supporting the KPop system? I don\u2019t think so\u2026yet.\" I'm with you there. At the end of the day, K-pop is a business. And a business will not run without money. How that is used and distributed is out of the fans' control... unless we stop consuming altogether which also affects the idols we admired.\n\nAnd you're welcome. It's Konglish (I think) for either comment or announcement. It's the talking parts of concerts and other events. :)",

KPop concerts are not like American concerts where there may be one or two opening acts before the headliner all within 2-3 hours. It's one artist performing very high-energy choreography for the entire duration of the concert for the same amount of time. These people need to breathe and rehydrate.\n\nAlso I don't know what American artists you've been seeing but it's incredibly common for them to have talking segments between songs too. I don't think I've been to a American concert where the artist *didn't* talk to the audience. I just saw both TXT and Paramore within the same week and Hayley Williams talked just as much as TXT did. I personally enjoy getting that artist interaction. To me, it's one of the aspects that makes concerts special. You don't get that from just listening to music at home. Also it gives *me* a chance to sit and breathe in between the dancing and singing along.",

            "comment": "Number 6: It really depends. Some companies are definitely worse than others, and while not every trainee has a horrible time or gets taken advantage of, they are definitely vulnerable. There have been some law changes recently to give more protection especially to very young trainees, which is a good step, but still more needs to happen. Underage kids being overworked is not just an idol thing though, a lot of kids in SK go to after school activities that are very demanding, and if you look at pro athletes all over the world, they probably also didn't have a lot of free time during their childhood. I'm not trying to defend overworking young idols, I'm just saying that it happens in other places too and that K-Pop is just being talked about more. So you could also ask people who like watching the olympics how they can support this when there are a lot of dark sides to it? In truth, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. The clothes you wear are probably not all fair trade, and if you consume any kind of animal product a fair case could be made of that being unethical as well. It's up to everyone how much they want to try and make the world a better place, and how much they just want to enjoy life. Long story short, it's a lot more nuanced than it looks and you shouldn't judge people \ud83d\ude00",

                    "comment": "Oh I agree. My friend in middle school was overworked by his sports-loving family to pursue Baseball. Kid was insanely talented, but I don't think he personally had the drive. We absolutely have a similar here in the US. But the \"whataboutism\" isn't fair, because at least in America there is the opportunity for that overworked athlete or artist to earn millions of dollars and have independence.\n\nI think the reason the Idol system is talked about more is not  west vs east cultural issue of finger-pointing. These idols are literally not even paid pennies on the dollar, and are unable to obtain their independence. In fact, they would be nothing outside of the machine that they are a part of. That is how manufactured K-Pop \"celebrity\" really is. Occasionally you have a viral hit like \"Gangnam\" or \"Dynamite\" that allows the artist to write their own ticket. But not most of the time. That's the fundamental difference: There is not path to personal liberation in the Idol system. And when Idols do something as egregious as get in a relationship or change their hair color, *fans go nuts* and get really, really possessive.\n\nI was really invested in this conversation across these message boards last night, so I deep-dived on some video essays. There's even some companies that have pimped out the girls in some of these groups.\n\nDoes the US have its own problems? Yes. That's why the Beebs acted like he did--under too much control and not enough say. But at least our industry has a path towards ownership of your own success. \n\n(Sorry to ramble.

It feels like you already have your very strongly formed opinion here and look only at what you want to see. That is not very professional and I would have expected more from a journalist whose job it is to look at different sides and stay neutral. Why even ask that question if you only want confirmation of what you already believe?",

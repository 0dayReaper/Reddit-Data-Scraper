            "comment": "It's basically a type of forum. It has a notice board for official announcements, a \"to fans\" board where the artist(s)/member(s) leave posts that can only be accessed by the users (sometimes there are separate boards for official fanclub members who got leveled-up and gained access for fanclub-only content), a \"to (artist)\" board where fans can write letters for their artists, a board where fans can interact, and so on.\n\nIt's usually the members-only/fanclub-only content the fans join for, especially because they can't be shared or reposted elsewhere. (Some fans find loopholes and do so anyway, but you're not supposed to do that!) It's also the easiest place to gain most of the useful information to keep updated on the artist(s).",

But if not, it's mostly just for interacting with other fans, maybe sharing some artist-related photos/videos/etc. or even scheduling meetups or deciding to go to an offline event together. Sometimes fans will open a fan cafe dedicated to their bias member and talk exclusively about them. Back in the 90s and 2000s, idol group members would often go online, browse these \"unofficial\" fan cafes, and join as many as possible to leave personal messages or just to chat with their fans.",

    "postText": "Hello, due to recent events I've decided to boycott SM. I assume other fans are as well. \n\nDoes anyone have any resources of fans particularly Nctzens or EXO-L boycotting that I can support? It could simply be fanbases on social media who are trying to organise a boycott. I want to help spread the word.\n\nThanks in advance!",

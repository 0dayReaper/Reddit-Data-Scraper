    "postText": "I like to expand on my musical taste. I just did hip-hop. Now I want to try K-Pop. I don't want to be one of those people that hate on a genre they have never listened to. So I would like some recommendations.\n\nSome of the genres/bands I like (If this helps): Genres: Black Metal/DSBM/Sludge Metal/Doom Metal.   Bands: Silencer/Sleep/Acid Mammoth.\n\nUpdate: After listening for a while. I don't think K-Pop is for me. A lot of people recommended Dreamcatcher, saying it would probably be the easiest transition. I tried listening to them and several other recommendations. I would be lying if I said I really liked any of them that much. I still have a respect for the genre. I'll try to listen to some of it every once in a while to see if I like anything. Thanks for the Recommendations! ",

So I would suggest you start with the basics and look at the groups who have done it the best.\n\n- Big Bang\n- Block B\n- EXO\n- Stray Kids\n- NCT\n\nThere's other groups you could include here but that would be the starter pack imo.\n\n- Big Bang - Bae Bae\n- Block B - Very Good\n- EXO - Obsession\n- Stray Kids - Gods Menu\n- NCT U - 7th Sense",

Guess I'd say poprock is their main vibe. Stray Kids is another good group that might be a hit for you.\n\nAnd there's a ton of amazing kbands, like Hoppipolla, CNBLUE, Day6 and N.Flying. All worth a look!\n\nThere's so much stuff. Kpop is just an umbrella term, and you'll find all kinds of groups and bands with all kinds of genres inside it. Basically it's just a new untapped reservoir of music, once you get past the language thing.",

                    "comment": "&gt;  Kpop is just an umbrella term\n\nI know this is an eternal debate, and Kpop is kind of an umbrella term, but in terms of how big that umbrella really is, I would argue true Kpop is like Hip Hop. To me, what is truly Kpop, and not a song, even a pop song, sung in Korean, is a combo of fashion, art, dance, music, and concept. Pure Kpop involves world building and proposing a narrative, even if it's loose. And in addition to the other things, Kpop involves fan service and comedy. IMO, to really get into Kpop, it means you understand the roles of a Kpop group, like a basketball team, who is good at them, and learning about their personalities and enjoying their comedy.\n\nI'm not saying this simply to debate the term Kpop. I'm only saying this because I was kind of in your shoes, but add to that I was born in Korea and wanted to learn about the culture. But I didn't REALLY get into Kpop until I stopped thinking of it as just songs to listen to, but a more immersive experience where you really champion certain idols for their personality. Just my experience. :)",

I also really enjoy The Rose. \n\nComing from hip though, you may enjoy [Flowsik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6Wp-MUhPbc) who has a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc3IN4GjAPs) with Jessi which I think contrasts nicely showing the grunge in his voice. It's the same reason I like Bobby's [Holup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Tap_zZdkYA). If you're looking for something lighter you might like Lay's [Honey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3n6DiaELcc).\n\nIt really just depends on your style, if you like stuff that can be a little haunting then you'll probably like [BewhY's Gottasadae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckZor7HRU1E). \n\nThen there are artists like Taemin who go for this astro pop feel that I cant even really explain in [Want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OfOkiVFmhM). He has such a large discography though and you'll pick up on his influences here and there if you explore it. I'm incredibly biased though because I love his music. Even my hardened gangster little brother played [Flame of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh-A6z7M0zc) on repeat. Other loved songs include [Press Your Number](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsOGiTSZ_cg) but I don't want to overwhelm you with info you may not need if you're not into his style.",

They\u2019re a 5-man band, with two vocalists, one of who doubles as a rapper.\n\nI\u2019d recommend Hot Potato (the guitar riff during the second verse rap/bridge is fucking awesome), The Real, and Awesome for more rock-heavy/intense sounds. Oh Really has a much lighter, more bubbly sound, but it\u2019s still really good. Flowerwork is also pretty rock-heavy and showcases some awesome vocals. Other favorites of mine are Sunset, 4242, Pardon?, and Flower Fantasy (a rock ballad). \n\nTheir Japanese work is also a lot more rock heavy, with some of my favorites there being Knock Knock and One and Only, but Stand By Me is also really good.",

I used to be a big rock/ metal fan and while I tend to gravitate to more of a bubbly sound now groups and idols will often do different concepts and you can find a wide range of things to enjoy within them.",

Dreamcatcher is good too, but it may not be the flavor you like, depending on the song. I don't like all their stuff, but Scream and Piri remind me of some early '00s rock I used to listen to.\nThere's a new group that just debuted called Kingdom that has an interesting concept. I haven't seen anything quite like it. Excalibur is their song.\nThe other recommendations you have gotten are good too. Like someone else said, Kpop is sensory. You kind of need to see the MVs as well as listen. There are so many different types of subgenres within Kpop, and then there's the hip-hop and R&amp;B stuff, like BiBi, as well.",

            "comment": "Alright so from what I'm reading our metal styles are very different but I'm going to list mine and how it influences what music I found/think relate or give metal feels.\n\nMy primary metal genres are symphonic, gothic and power. I like the contrast of a sweet vocal with something rough and dirty and multiple voices. Choirs are preferred and multiple singers. I still like my stuff heavy but I think it's more mid tier (not black metal hard so a few steps below that).\n\nHOWEVER, we might still be able to find something for you.\n\nVixx is really up there... they're one group I found many symphonic metalheads to fall in love with and if you listen closely they have a lot of the gothic metal sound. I'd recommend...\n\nFantasy - Vixx\n\nHyde - Vixx\n\nTrigger - Vixx\n\nA.C.E. goes heavy on the dancing and the EDM but it layers just like metal does. I saw someone else recommended them already but they really do a balance of pretty with heavy instrumentals. I'd recommend...\n\nCallin - A.C.E.\n\nTake Me Higher - A.C.E.\n\nGoblin - A.C.E.\n\nSF9 can be heavy on the electronic layering but they really shine in their b-sides. For me I fell in love with their title track RPM because it has that feeling of metal in the instrumentals with some really nice vocals on top. I wish I could describe it better but maybe take a listen first...\n\nRPM - SF9\n\nMidnight Show - SF9\n\nSeventeen is very diverse they do anything from soft cute and High School Musicalish to oh my god who are these boys. They have a lot of music so I'm sure there's at least ONE song you'd like...  \n\n\nHit - Seventeen\n\nGetting Closer - Seventeen\n\nCall Call Call - Seventeen\n\nKARD is another of my favorites. They're a coed group so almost one of a kind.. there aren't many of them out there. They recently had the problems of getting songs written for them so BM took it into his own hands to give them something that hits HARD. They're one of my favorites (Vixx is my first)...\n\nBomb - KARD\n\nDumb Litty - KARD\n\nf(x) is a little experimental sounding to me and it works. They're an older girl group. I got into the late but they still have good music. I'd recommend...\n\nRed Light - f(x)\n\nDracula - f(x)\n\nAirplane - f(x)\n\nI feel like I need to add more girl groups. I'm a bit... pickier? when it comes to them. They tend to stray away from the heavier sounds tho the trend right now is to get some kickass girls that know how to get what they want so I'll just put a few mixed together here for you to see if you like any.\n\nChewy - D. Holic\n\nNot Shy - ITZY\n\nStay Tonight - Chungha\n\nDDD - EXID (highly recommend them anyways)\n\nLip &amp; Hip - Hyuna\n\nSince we have very different tastes in metal you might not like any of the songs I recommended. Hopefully you find one you like but if you don't it's okay! Don't force yourself to go hard into the genre. You might only like one or two songs or one or two artists. It's a BIG genre.\n\nHave fun !",

Theres a difference other than the language in that fashion, called Visual Kei, or v-kei for short overlaps with some j metal/rock bands, it's interesting imo, as someone who likes eccentric fashion.\n\nSo, some of the more popular bands with the western audience are: cross faith (metalcore/electronicore) and crystal lake(deathcore, metalcore, nu metal), who have performed at some festivals out in the west too. I dont really listen to them, but if your into the metal scene there, then I might start with that. Deviloof is also pretty good (deathcore mainly)\n\nMy personal favorite that I'd highly recommend is: The Gazette (alt metal, industrial metal, metalcore, etc) I'd recommend their songs: Ugly, Falling, Invisible Wall, 13 stairs.\n\nI hope this comment doesnt get taken down for going a little off topic from the original post lol.

I'd rather suggest you listen to Secrets of the Moon lol\n\nKpop should be for when you need something catchy and cheesy, like Oh My Girl's Dolphin or catchy and upbeat like Everglow's Bom Bom Chocolate.",

But I see the comments are all focusing on trying to match your taste, rather than giving you more mainstream kpop to explore, so I wanted to bring that up.\n\nKpop is not so much a genre as it is just a term used for \"music from Korea\", so there's a LOT that can fall under the \"K-pop\" umbrella. Korean hip-hop and surrounding genres are generally not included under K-pop though, probably because it is a big enough subculture.\n\nBut yeah I've seen metal fans who love things like Apink's earlier songs (say NoNoNo, U You), or what have you.\n\nIf you're looking for actual quality, most of K-pop isn't it though. Mainstream K-pop is normally super catchy on purpose, and puts a lot of emphasis on the idols, dance and visuals, rather than just the music.\n\nI personally think J-Min's music is great though:\n\n* **Shine** (light rock?) https://youtu.be/vhGeQaqdkhw\n* **Ready For Your Love** (pop): https://youtu.be/E5BNfSDaBWk\n* **Huu** (ballad): https://youtu.be/GyL9E-PjI0o",

I don't know as much about the hip-hop side of Kpop, but some popular artists are Zico, Jessi, and Crush. There are also a lot of great bands. N.Flying, Onewe, Day6, and The Rose are a few popular Kbands. The Rose is my favorite Korean band followed by Day6.",

I don\u2019t really think k-pop is something you can easily and casually enjoy... or you CAN but it\u2019s a lot harder because the members/industry/visuals are so linked with the music that it\u2019s just a big picture with a lot to take in. If you\u2019re not interested in that then k-pop might not be your thing and that is totally understandable. Many who like k-pop usually like the visual components just as much, the catchy choreos and stages. \n\nIf you ever come back for more suggestions however I want to suggest some Infinite songs (I don\u2019t listen to metal so it\u2019s not the same but thought it might be worth mentioning):\n\n- I Hate\n- Dilemma (Jap)\n- I Don\u2019t Know\n- The Chaser (god-tier song imo)\n- Paradise\n- Last Romeo\n- Up to you\n- Shine (Sunggyu solo)",

            "comment": "Gonna be honest, I think a lot of people throw around the term \"rock\" or \"rock-influenced\" for any song that has any amount of electric/distorted guitar. But in all honesty, I think **B.A.P** might be the most rock-influenced kpop group I know of (more rock-influenced than Dreamcatcher imo, though I am a huge fan of Dreamcatcher. As an aside, DC's most rock-ish song imo is [Break The Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K20hUORnbmA)). Here's some B.A.P recommendations:\n\n[Dystopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLkrd3BYlkA) (my sister thought this was a Sabaton song at first)\n\n[Skydive MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI9ZkVgBbEs) / [uncut song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ajy06XHVOY)\n\n[Bangx2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8q8WAnacVI)\n\n[Save Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo1y7N2W2L8)\n\n[Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp7QaUv0opg)\n\n[What The Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXXFVODn4Fw)\n\n[I Remember](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ILpI6qwb0)\n\nIf you liked hiphop at all you might also like these B.A.P songs:\n\n[One Shot MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zRzl1d5vNU) / [uncut song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SMix8cgxDU)\n\n[Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLooPlf2Sw)\n\n[Pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bAuwnu4ohY)\n\n[No Mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hzz4mGyehw)\n\nAlso one of my favorite B.A.P songs is [Ribbon in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11mYrSQwf7c) but idk what subgenre it is. If you're looking to expand your tastes to Korea in general, I recommend **Jambinai**. They're a folk rock band. A lot of their music is too soft/ambient for me tbh but these are my favorites:\n\n[Time of Extinction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wje_Uij4aBA) (they also performed it at the [2018 winter olympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx5HKaK-b10))\n\n[They Keep Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB1k7CDVWVk)\n\n[Onda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s1LlL54oIw)",

I also listen to metal music ;) . I have a great idea.. I think it would be better for you to check out more of the bands first. L0ren is an amazing artist. Please give him a chance. He is nothing like the rest. I really think that you would enjoy his music. Empty Trash is a great song to start off with and I really think you would love it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f28Pi14g0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f28Pi14g0w) There is a link to that song. It is a lot closer to metal/rock than a lot of the other kpop type groups. I bet you will really love the very end of the song.  He is a new artist.  Another group and song that I would recommend is Zombie... It not really like l0ren at all but its a great song. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WehhSc1knYY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WehhSc1knYY) . It might be in the wrong direction but it really is good. Please give it a try. \n\nAlso, kmetal is also an options. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8EcRh7Ss4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8EcRh7Ss4). you will love it :) \n\nDo you like EDM?",

Like real metal (I guess, I don't know much about metal (do like it though), but they do screaming and stuff and I guess that is part of metal?).\n\nHere some song recommendations:\n\n**Bursters**\n\n[Therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75XUONSoZU8) (this is their most recent stuff I could find, it's about 6 months old)\n\n[Lost Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk5HW1fkBvE)  (one of my favorite songs of all time actually)\n\n\\--&gt; [Live version of Lost Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyN0TtRGbrQ) on a TV music show\n\n\\--&gt; [Concert live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbTcD1xz7Ko) (usually very different than those kpop TV shows)\n\n[Smell the Rot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EZ2ep5DtX4)\n\n[Barriers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8EcRh7Ss4) (MV) --&gt; ([live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW5JFnVKCGU))\n\n[Colors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuSl9MhrAF8)  (all-English song)\n\n[Dreamer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvPhy4unm1Q)\n\n[SAVAGE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJeyrbAXAg8)\n\n[Wherever You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7sciBL-cA) (one of their 'softer' songs with a music video)\n\n[Katy Perry - Firework Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1-c8PAFnUs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Guckkasten**\n\n[Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiiWuOCzoao)\n\n[Manicure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-7fmKLO5FU)\n\n[Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b971NOZEbgo) ('softer' song)\n\n[Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abVo6GcEmKY) (different songs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou already wrote that you didn't like most of Dreamcatcher etc. but I really hope you'll listen to these two groups too, because I think they are truly different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Oh, and as non-Kpop but Korean I recommend ***JANNABI***. They are also a band but they usually do 'softer' (sry, Idk how to describe it in another way) songs. But they have some really cool stuff on their b-sides.\n\nOne of my favorite title songs is [Good Boy Twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twIUeUkEyks).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd if you like hip-hop the I recommend early BTS stuff (some are a combi of hip hop and rock influence):\n\nCypher Pt.1-4 ([all Cyphers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbgM4f6KSoU) in one video)\n\n[No More Dream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG5L7UsUxA)\n\n[We Are Bulletproof Pt.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqhWHy0rrtM)\n\n[N.O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5GaAEHvHj0)\n\n[Satoori Rap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCG7q-yRkyY) (aka Paldogangsan) --&gt; it's only the rap line and it's about the different dialects (more specific the dialects from the regions the members are from) of different regions in Korea and they also rap in their respective dialect, but as a non-Korean it's not really important to you\n\n[Boy In Luv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8MfJg68oCs) (rock influenced)\n\n[Danger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bagj78IQ3l0) (rock influence)\n\n[We On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar7_p4k7gJQ)\n\n[Attack On Bangtan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RsFNXsvusw)\n\n[Spine Breaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvszZE1TZaU)\n\n[Jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLj7XbNU3Qk)\n\n[What Am I To you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3OLpHsAR54)\n\n[Hip Hop Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJWS3faAlgk)\n\n[UGH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-0QlQH5d3Y)\n\n[Respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGlNNesooys)\n\n[Intro: Persona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Uy0opVF3s)\n\n[Interlude: Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV1gCvzpSy0)\n\nThere's a lot more BTS hip hop stuff, but I can't list them all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd the rap lines solo stuff (links include the full tracklist of their albums):\n\nRM - [RM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9glZVktVKVw) mixtape\n\nAgust D - [Agust D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTe07O-fd18) mixtape, [D-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqE9KxZdJvw)\n\nj-hope - [Hope World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt-yOFYSxbs)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing regarding the live versions: Sometimes those ~~sh\\*tty~~ kpop TV shows (the ones Bursters live versions are from) don't allow bands that play instruments to play them live, so don't be surprised if seems like they aren't really playing. But singing live is usually accepted.\n\nAnother thing: K-bands/K-rock (bands that play their own instruments) - whether it's a Kpop Idol band or just Korean artist band - aren't usually really popular in South Korea because Koreans/the Korean public usually aren't into rock but prefer ballads (that's why many k-rock bands also promote a lot in Japan), so it's harder to find them.\n\nAdditionally, many use rather soft songs as the song to promote because it's more gp friendly and has better chances to chart, but have harder hitting songs on the rest of the album.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's really great to see a band like Bursters on one of those TV shows because it's already unusual for k-bands with softer and more gp friendly and rather pop-rock songs to perform there, so it's really a miracle to me that a band like Bursters got to perform there.\n\nMost K-bands that had some popularity in Korea are Idol bands (i.e. they're kpop but still do more rock stuff and play their own instruments), like FTIsland, CNBlue, Day6 and N.Flying.\n\nK-rock bands usually also have more creative freedom than your average kpop idol (even though if they are kpop Idols too)",

The genre ranges from rock to goth-like to metal, but with a different musical structure and often androgenous appearance. The genres started as a focus on visual performance and breaking Japan's conservative norms. Songs tend to mix melodic parts with rock and metal more than than western bands. I'd suggest Dir En Grey, Kizu, Xanvala, Dada Roma, Mejibray, Diaura, Razor, Xaa Xaa, Zigzag and Arelequin to start. I bet there's something in there you'll like. If you didn't like Stray Kids- 'God's Menu' or A.C.E-'Undercover', K-pop probably isn't for you 'cause those are pretty damn likable. All my fave's were mentioned here. You might like some K-pop adjacent stuff tho. Check out Lay's video for 'Lit'. If nothing else, you should see it for how freaking amazing and expensive it is. Note: this was written after you noped out on kpop;)",

            "comment": "Yo yo. Im a metalhead as well. Im not going to lie, at first I thought KPOP WAS WEIRD. Especially as a drummer (of 7years) I thought lots of the music lacked actual musical and instrumental ability. But that is when I learnt to appreciate the Vocal ability of many of these artists.\n\nTbh, some of my favourite kpop artists are soloist and known primarily for their singing: such as Taeyeon, IU, Babylon and Taemin (though i have listened to Taeyeon much more). However, it has taken me around a year and a half to TRULY appreciate the music.\n\nCurrently In metal i have been listening to:\nLamb of God 2020 album\nBehemoth- I Loved you at your darkest\nFleshgod apocalypse - Veleno\nAvenged sevenfold- all of it\nSlipknot- We Are Not Your Kind\n\nIf you want be able to make your own unbiased opinion on kpop, I think the best thing to do is to listen to lots of different artists (it doesn't have to be the whole discography) and if you find a song you like, you'll find that you will keep going back to it. Slowly, this can help to accustom you to kpop.\n\nI disagree with others who have said to listen to Dreamcatcher to help with transitioning, because that limits you a lot. But i understand why people have said that!\n\nIf you want some artists and their albums, I would recommend:\n\nBTS: love yourself Her - with my favourite songs being Best Of Me, Dimple and Pied Piper\nThe 3 singles: Ugh!, I Need U and ON\n\nMamamoo- Red Moon... My favourite is Egotistic\n\nVicton- The Future Is Now... My favourite songs being What I Said, Unpredictable (which is a very funky 80's song which reminds me of Michael Jacksons Billie Jean) and Flip a Coin which is my favourite favourite \ud83e\udd70.\n\nWonder Girls- Reboot... My favourite songs being... baby don't play, John Doe and One Black Black\n\nZico- the song is called... Any Song\n\nI know this is quite a long post. Sorry. I just wanted to ensure that like me you could be able to experience the best KPOP can have from the perspective of a Metalhead.\n\nP.s, there is a Korean metal band who you may like. They are called... Remnants of the fallen\n\nLet me know if this was useful...\n\nAll the best...\ud83d\udc4d",

I'm more into progressive and symphonic metal, but I think I can help.\n\nA lot of the comments I'm noticing are recommending rock-sounding groups and songs, and while that's dandy, it's not really representative of K-Pop or necessarily a good transition from metal. Especially given the fact that you're a fan of black/sludge/doom.\n\nI'm going to recommend you start with No Diggity - ONEUS,  GO - NCT DREAM, and Turn Back Time - WayV. Very noisy and will make full use of your headphones, assuming you've invested in nice ones. If you've adjusted your phone's equalizer at all, you shouldn't have to make any adjustments for these songs.\n\nI'd also recommend Miroh, Side Effects, Gods Menu, and Back Door, all by Stray Kids. Miroh and Gods Menu are loud EDM, but they have a lot of details and layers that I think you'll appreciate. I'm not how you feel about progmetal, but Side Effects and Back Door are my personal dreams come true. Very experimental by K-Pop standards and they sound amazing through my pricey headphones (again, assuming you've invested in your own). Also very detailed in their production.\n\nI'd recommend more but I'm sure you're overwhelmed with everyone insisting you listen to Dreamcatcher and ATEEZ. I hope you find something you like in K-Pop despite your very juxtaposed taste!",

    "postText": "I'm trying to design a character and my main reference is Lee Leejung of YGX dance crew, but I don't want to rely too heavily on her because I want to make sure the design is unique. However, I can't think of anyone with a similar face shape/jawline \u2014 long but with a stronger almost rounded jawline rather than the more common diamond or V shape, sort of like the end of a pill.\n\nI've always found Leejung to be super pretty but she's also very cool, I want a strong and athletic look in addition to idol visuals which is why I'm curious about this face shape specifically. The only people who come to mind right now are maybe Seulgi and possibly Leeseo, but I can't think of anyone that fits super closely. \n\nI know this is sort of an odd request and I get this isn't necessarily *about* kpop, but I don't know where else to ask; if somewhere like kpop thoughts is better I'll move this over there. There may not be many, but if anyone can think of some idols who fit the description please help me out!",

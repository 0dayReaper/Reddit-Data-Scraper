    "postText": "So I've just watched the full cuts of NCT x Korean Englishman (even if you're not a full-time NCTzen, please do give these videos a chance because Josh and Ollie are VERY ENTERTAINING).\n\nAside from the funny interactions I couldn't help but want to immediately fly back to Korea and try out the food they were having!\n\nRestaurant 1 (with Mark and Jaehyun) serves Chinese-Korean cuisine and Restaurant 2 (with Johnny) serves different types of beef.\n\n[Mark &amp; Jaehyun](https://youtu.be/Gpr3d2FaXOo)\n[Johnny](https://youtu.be/3gyVe1KGHeE)\n\nI tried Google Lens but to no avail. Can anyone help identify what restaurants these are? I reaaaaaalllyyyyyy want to try the cream shrimp and beef stew next time I'll be in Korea \ud83e\udd72 plus the luxury beef restaurant where Johnny ate with them is a famous one for K-Pop stars (but still did not come up on my searches).\n\nOn this note, have you ever gone on a \"K-Pop pilgrimage\" of some sort and went out to try vacation spots or restaurants that your favorite groups have been to? How was the experience?",

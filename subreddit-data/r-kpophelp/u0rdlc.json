I worked at Sephora in college and I wrecked my skin from trying so many of the skincare freebies we used to get from there, except funnily enough the Shiseido products (not k beauty but still in the Asian skincare realm) were one of the few that didn\u2019t mess up my skin.",

I have really sensitive skin, but I was using a lot of really harsh apricot/sugar scrubs and mud masks. I got really into k-beauty after getting into kpop because I'd never seen skin so amazing before. I now rotate like 3 light serums in my routine that I didn't even know existed before, also added essence and regular sheet masks. I know those things may be normal for some people, but I was clueless. Fully turned my skin around!",

I've been learning for 2 years and I started with the memrise course (I finished Korean 1, which helped a lot with starting me off on the journey!) I also supplemented with resources from TTMIK, Billygo, textbooks (Yonsei's ones are good!), etc, and there's also this one youtube video that teaches you how to learn all the hangul in 5 minutes which was a huge help in the early stages. The subreddit for korean learning is also amazing and people give such in depth answers and it really helps with daily exposure if you're someone who browses reddit at least once everyday lol. I also did the coursera course from Yonsei University, and by this time I was good enough to surpass level one and qualify (through a placement test) for a level two class at my own uni :) \n\nAnd i think the most important one is probably continued exposure to native speakers, so go ahead and watch k content as it will help in picking it up quicker. I watch a lot of k variety (actually my default genre of tv shows lol) and that's how I started picking up Korean vocab before even formally starting, and also gave me a huge reason to even start learning the language (because listening to the language being spoken made me realise how beautiful it was and made me appreciate it). yeneung ftw lol\n\nedit: oh and Hellotalk, italki are good for practice talking to native speakers! I also joined a Korean-English language exchange server later on which is nice for trying to communicate in Korean without being judged for being non-fluent.",

I respect actual k- pop musicians too much to be able to write love scenes involving real living breathing artists( I just can\u2019t. I would diiiiiii ie of second hand embarrassment) so my story revolves around their fans finding love ( not with the band!) But the band is a riot to write, and they are having adventures along the way. I had to write a gorgeous, genius k- pop band! Hahaha!",

Like just a slight bow. I think I picked that up after my first fanmeet. Honestly it just kinda feels natural to do so atp? Like I don\u2019t think about it. I also give/receive things with two hands now, especially if it\u2019s something like a book or otherwise large enough that it\u2019s not awkward to do so. Also peace signs in pictures. It\u2019s a plague. I can\u2019t stop. Curse my ult bias for instilling this one in me.\n\nMostly just small stuff I saw that kinda made sense in my brain so I guess I internalized it and started copying. None of it really gets in the way and none of it is particularly embarrassing or weird, so I don\u2019t pay much attention to it anymore.\n\nEdit: Covering my mouth and giving/receiving things have been solved.

After moving to the US, I always felt the need to blend in, avoid using my expressions. But now idc. I use my uy, uf, ay, ya because the media I consume is no longer only in english my brain is pushing my own language to the forefront again. \n\nFor example, my family does the \u201ckkkk\u201d when we laugh a lot. And i hid that, now it is back and I love it, so you can say it is a korean thing, but I use it that way i grew up hearing it. \u201cAish\u201d is another. Sometimes it comes out Aish others comes out more like Ay. At times I use it how they use it, at times to be more for more like pain situations for me. But definitely being saying it more with my english. \u201cYa\u201d also is part of my english now. I use it like either to agree with someone or to tell them to stop, or i get it. My family abroad pointed it out, so I believe it is not a Spanish thing. I think it is me creating my own little reactions after being exposed to how idols react. Needless to say Rather than me doing stuff they do is more of me bringing back my own culture as I learn theirs. \n\nBeing super dramatic: i am already a dramatic person. But I literally go full out idol/kdrama style. Throwing myself to the ground walking away being very entertaining as if I am filming a segment of my own variety show. \n\nPeace signs (the comeback): I use to do these a lot in High School (I had no Kpop exposure), now they are a normal occurrence in my life and photos lol.\n\nWork ethic: to be honest this one really pushed me. How  hard they work and how dedicated they are inspired me a lot. It made me want to focus in my dreams and work hard for what I want. \n\nI think it mainly made me aware of things I do where I am come from rather than adopting from them. Certain hand movements, head nods, expressions, values. It made me not want to blend and be more American, but be the fusion of cultures I am, and who I am based on my own life experiences.",

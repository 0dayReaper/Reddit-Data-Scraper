Also, [this video](https://youtu.be/D6PMfIGoppQ) by Beomhan.\n\nThey are obviously a bit biased, since it\u2019s content by idols/former idols, but it\u2019s as close as you can get without sensationalism getting in.\n\nAlso, novels, webtoons, etc. are not real and may be even more biased about what they want to portray, no matter if it\u2019s positive or negative, to use it as a literary tool to develop their story.",

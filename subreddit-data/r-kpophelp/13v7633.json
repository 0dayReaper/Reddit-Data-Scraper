    "postText": "I'm really new to buying albums for Kpop groups. I just bought the 3 version of the new Dreamcatcher album. I'm not sure if it's better to keep at least one sealed for potential future collectability reasons or just opening them all to enjoy all the bonus content inside. Looking for thoughts from others on their own collections and what you do.",

Plus it's fun to see all the different versions of the photobook. \n\nAlso, it's best to collect your favorites. Like the groups or soloists whose content you absolutely love. I'm 3 years into K-Pop and I finally realized that after a couple unnecessary purchases. I missed unboxing albums (kinda weird I know) so I randomly bought some groups albums and while I like them the novelty has started to wear off. So now I'm stuck with albums I don't really want. So please keep this in mind as you grow your collection.\n\nOh also it's fun to actually play the CD. Not only do you get your money's worth but to me the music sounds better on a cd. Hope this helps!",

I just really don\u2019t know how else to describe this vibe.",

Perhaps [I'm Really Hurt](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P4EvcKrjHTE&amp;pp=ygUMSW0gaHVydCB0YXJh) by T-ARA and [Love Bomb](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-SK6cvkK4c0&amp;pp=ygUSbG92ZSBib21iIGZyb21pc185) by fromis_9. [Closer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk&amp;pp=ygURY2xvc2VyIG9oIG15IGdpcmw%3D) by Oh My Girl is definitely a bit eerie. Also [I'm Unhappy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CC7OrEx5H4U&amp;pp=ygUQSW0gdW5oYXBweSBhZXNwYQ%3D%3D) by aespa and [Anywhere but Home](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2hVimOZHbOI&amp;pp=ygUYYW55d2hlcmUgYnV0IGhvbWUgc2V1bGdp) by Seulgi. Bit more of a stretch but [LP](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V_-hopU-I4M&amp;pp=ygUNbHAgcmVkIHZlbHZldA%3D%3D) by Red Velvet and [Sweet Witches](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=310VCqyzaNg&amp;pp=ygUQc3dlZXQgd2l0Y2hlcyBmeA%3D%3D) by f(x) have fairground sounds which maybe verge on creepy, [On a Ride](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KEvlXSuGPXA&amp;pp=ygUUb24gYSByaWRlIHJlZCB2ZWx2ZXQ%3D) and [Ice Cream Cake](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=glXgSSOKlls&amp;pp=ygUZaWNlIGNyZWFtIGNha2UgcmVkIHZlbHZldA%3D%3D) do too. I might add [Irreversible](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjOZlmLUe0&amp;pp=ygUFR2FpbiA%3D), [Carnival](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHJQ7CYqQM&amp;pp=ygUFR2FpbiA%3D) and [Bloom](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=K64mb5KUhhs&amp;pp=ygUFR2FpbiA%3D) for Gain too, they're all not really creepy but slightly unsettling.",

Less *dark* but definitely *off*.\n* Not as contemporary but I feel like 2NE1 played with this kind of sound a lot: [Crush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRTfQ16wbjM), [I Am The Best](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_lSP8Vc3o)\n* And I haven't mentioned any boy groups or male artists but this is SKZ's bag. See: [Venom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM-jOfy_1jM)\n* Lots of Red Velvet fits this I think (which I am sure is no surprise to any casual fan).

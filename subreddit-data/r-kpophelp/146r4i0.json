I already have:\n\nSirius - cignature\nPolaris - Dreamcatcher\nGemini - Taeyeon\nPisces - Yerin Baek\n\nIdk how many more there could be but it feels like Kpop's obsession with space should produce a few more \ud83e\udd14  I also know EXO Chen's Japanese debut called Polaris is coming out in August",

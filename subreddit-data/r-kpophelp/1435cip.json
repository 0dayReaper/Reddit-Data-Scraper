It's what got me into kpop ,so I will always have special feelings for that one. \n\nAnd Devil By The Window is so cool. It is completely in English yet still comes across as kpop. I'm not sure how they managed that, but they did. There's nothing about it that makes me think it was made in a Western country or for the western market. It still gives kpop 100% but in English lol",

They have one for TXT, you can find it on their artist's profile, it's called \"This is Tomorrow X Together\". I just start playing the playlist on shuffle in the background while doing something else (cooking, cleaning the house, during commute, etc...) and evertime a song is good enough to make me stop what I'm doing to say \"oooh that's nice i like this one!!!!\" I add it to my own playlist :)\nThat way you get a good mix of title tracks and b-sides from all their albums and eras, it's helpful especially if you're not sure what genre you prefer.",

Kyla\u2019s injury is often pointed to as a reason for the group disbanding, as if it was somehow completely impossible for the company to continue supporting the group without her there. Kyla herself says that the company didn\u2019t want to leave her out so they paused on Pristin as OT10, but then they never supported the group again. They were basically like \u201cwell Kyla hit her head so send her home and forget about this group let\u2019s just debut the two popular ones with a few others and forget the rest\u201d - or that\u2019s at least how it came across to everyone",

I don't think the vagueness of not telling the members when to come back and why they weren't continuing is Kyla specific tho, it's a group-wide fuck-up.

Maybe there's more to it that we don't know but everything i've seen has made me \"???\" in confusion that they would fumble their most lucrative asset that hard, on top of some of it just seeming extremely weird or even rude on an interpersonal level.",

(they have done a few covers but its either songs that have no interest for kpop stans or songs from their own artists\u2026which doesn\u2019t really bring much interest)\n\nwoollim is generally just a very strange company. none of the stuff they do makes sense, they\u2019re a mid-tier company with few employees yet they had like 7 groups/artists to manage at some point (lovelyz and infinite members have since left but \ud83e\udd74)\nwoollim also made the odd decision to have a shared cover youtube channel, so they\u2019d post 2 covers a week for a period of time. the thing is that you had no idea if the members from the group you stanned was even included and often times it would be the same 3 golden child members that got to perform on the channel :/",

Also Yohan isn't the only one who came with fans, since all members are survival show alumni.

After the news came out and before they got kicked out Pentagon lost a huge portion of their Korean fanbase, their public image suffered dramatically and the members were involved and a ton of other rumors that surfaced as a chain reaction, all while they had just barely started to hit big with Shine. It literally made Cube's up-and-coming boygroup take a huge turn for the worse at the worst moment possible.",

As if the statement was ready and they were just waiting for the rumors to happen - and they denied as fast as they could so their artists couldn't respond to the media themselves. Which considering what HyunA had made for the company over the years, must have felt downright *insulting*, hence her choice to just go through with announcing their relationship as if Cube hadn't said anything.",

Hyuna is still relatively well known but hasn\u2019t made any big waves since joining PNation, Dawn is more known as \u2018Hyuna\u2019s Boyfriend\u2019 if anything nowadays then for his music. But yes, Cube could have handled their dating scandal better. For Soojin\u2019s case, i actually think they did as best they could and were shot in the foot by Soojin mentioning that she would leave if she was proven guilty. Cube isn\u2019t very good at managing, sure, but there are way, way worse companies out there",

We wanted to send him off together to a good place while missing him.\u201d He explained that the venue had been booked a year earlier for all five members.*\n\n  \n*\u201cI never imagined that there would be bad things said about that,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cThere were comments posted too. They said that we were using a sad event as marketing. I hated hearing that so much.\u201d*\n\n  \n*Taemin said, \u201cI always sought to show something good for others, but I now want to do it for us. We worked together for so long and the result was that if we didn\u2019t overcome this then our members would separate, and we didn\u2019t want that, so we decided we had to try to overcome it. It was the same with the album.\u201d*\n\n  \n*Minho added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that everything will be okay. But when we perform or when our music plays, I think we\u2019ll be able to have strength and enjoy it while doing well if you think that it\u2019s not just the four of us, but all of us doing it together. We couldn\u2019t not talk about it on today\u2019s broadcast, but there are some parts that we wanted to address, like Key said. It\u2019s not that everything is okay, but we\u2019re going to work hard while promoting, and we hope you\u2019ll watch over us.\u201d*",

They're easily one of the very best group line ups to come from a survival show (Under Nineteen), every single winner made sense, the group was complete, they had it all. The show wasn't really popular but they did get some attention, for instance, first place Jeon Doyum (now a Just B member) had almost 700K votes in the finale and fellow member Jeong Taekhyeon had a nice career as a child actor.   \n\n\nWe as a fandom knew shit was gonna go horribly wrong from the day they dropped their debut album out of nowhere on a Friday at 3 in the morning and the album pre order started... the day AFTER their debut. They did manage to get some attention, though, with a good amount of views in their main MV and their other two MVs, one of which had a storyline and whatnot. They appeared on variety shows, had their moving into dorm reality show, yadda yadda. What does MBK do? Put a project group with a contract of 17 months into a 7 months hiatus. And what does MBK do after promoting their first comeback? Put them into yet another 8 months hiatus. By the time they had their third comeback (last before disbanding) the members had been away for so long that when they reunited they had the most uncomfortable and awkward live known to mankind. A month later they just disbanded with a last single and remakes of their U19 songs.   \n\n\nThe group had everything to be big. They had the talent, the personalities, the good music, group dynamics that evolved positively, yet MBK wasted them for no reason whatsoever.",

Instead, they went with bouncy because that type of music was popular at the time, but it didn't help them stand out at all because everyone was doing that type of music and sound.\n\nAlso I'm pretty sure Juri is a popular member in the group, but the company doesn't push her at all",

            "comment": "Of course we can easily point out the worst decisions because we now have the luxury of hindsight forgetting that some of these stupid decisions were made BECAUSE of fans.\n\nExample bullying. Kpop fans have the habit of judging idols with little or no evidence so when the public turns against the idol, the company has no choice but to drop them.\n\nAnother example, dating. We all LOVE to hold up Dawn and Hyuna as the patron saints of coupledom NOW, but the reality is that they're the exception because they endured and got a 2nd chance with Psy despite the hate they got from kpop fans and the gp then. \n\nIf they had broken up or one of them did something bad y'all would have turned on them real quick and called them (especially Hyuna) all sorts of names.\n\nWe wonder why idols don't date publicly, it's because the girl would get slut-shamed and the guy would be called a perve by fans in the next fan war.\n\nSorry, this turned into a bit of a rant.\n\nTldr, some of these bad decisions are made because of the fans.",

Especially with Hyuna and Dawn, Korean fans were losing their minds in the worst way (they felt lied to and all this and were under the mindset of 'if you lie about this what else do you lie about?'). It calmed down when Cube denied it (fans were more like 'oh it was just a rumour, that happens all the time') but then when Hyuna took it upon herself to say Cube was lying, that made everything 100x worse.",

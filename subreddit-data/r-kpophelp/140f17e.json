    "postText": "I\u2019ve been trying to buy concert tickets (first time buying) from resellers and I\u2019ve noticed a lot of them don\u2019t want to use PayPal G&amp;S and request to use F&amp;F, Venmo G&amp;S, Zelle, etc. - is there a reason for this? I know that sellers wouldn\u2019t prefer PayPal G&amp;S  in the case that they think I\u2019m a fraudulent buyer and will dispute the charge, but is there any other legitimate reason why?\n\nevery seller I\u2019ve almost committed to buying from revealed that they aren\u2019t willing to transact via PayPal G&amp;S, which makes me wary of buying tickets from them. (I will add that besides for the payment method issue, they don\u2019t seem to give other red flags). Is me turning down a seller who doesn\u2019t agree to PayPal G&amp;S an overreaction? What are other methods (besides ticket proofs + age of accounts) that I can use to evaluate whether someone might scam me out of my money \n\nthanks in advance !",

            "comment": "recently there's been some changes in how much money a person can make selling items online before it's considered taxable income\n\n[here's a good thread i found on the PayPal subreddit that explains it in the comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/paypal/comments/slzpni/um_excuse_me_taxes_over_600/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) long and short of it is, anyone who sells $600 or more in a single year will be sent an extra form while filing taxes, but just because you *might* need to pay taxes on it doesn't mean you absolutely *will* if you're just a hobbyist and not an actual business. the form is more about accurate record keeping with the IRS, the worry is largely overblown, and people who skirt around using only F&amp;F could still see the same outcome because there's only so much money you can receive as a \"gift\" before it can possibly be taxed as well\n\ni also just wanna say that the worries about fraudulent charge backs via G&amp;S are largely overblown. i've delt with a couple buyers who've tried to charge back their money, and PayPal has sided with me every single time. i haven't lost a penny to those fraudulent cases. you know how it's common to take photo and video proof of packing up the items, double checking that it's exactly what the person ordered, verifying addresses, and sometimes even recording when dropping the item off in the mail? yeah, that all works as solid proof to PayPal that the charge back is fraudulent. not to mention how providing a tracking number helps just on its own\n\nfor nonphysical items such as ticket transfers, i'd urge people to screen record the trade and just edit out any sensitive information if you ever have to send it to PayPal as proof. it's really not that hard for sellers to protect themselves from fraudulent charge backs\n\nnever ever ever let someone convince you out of doing G&amp;S for either of the reasons above. i've come across legitimately misinformed sellers who have been very happy to take G&amp;S as payment once i explained all of this. so it's possible these tickets sellers could sell to you if you do the same. but anyone else still insisting to use any other form of payment should be avoided. G&amp;S gives protection to both buyers and sellers, but F&amp;F doesn't give buyers any protection whatsoever. if sellers aren't sympathetic to that but want you to sympathize with their difficulties of taxes and fraudulent charge backs, then that's really all you need to decide they're not worth buying from to begin with",

In some buying/selling communities I\u2019m a part of, sellers will include the fee in their price or ask that you pay the costs they\u2019d incur with it.\n\nThat said, I would never buy tickets without G&amp;S. Too many scammers.",

Basically the amount where you wouldn\u2019t be extremely upset if you got scammed out of it.\n\nEspecially for ticket sellers, refusing G&amp;S is a huge red flag. They may claim it is to avoid fees and tax filing implications, but with how many ticket scammers exist the most likely reason is they are scamming you out of your money. You will have no recourse with PayPal if you are scammed out of money using F&amp;F, and they say as such in their terms.",

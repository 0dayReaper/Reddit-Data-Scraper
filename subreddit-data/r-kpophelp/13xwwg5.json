    "postText": "Hi guys!  \nI'm planning to be in Korea for SHINee's upcoming cb and I will be hosting a GO to help me get into a fansign event. For those albums it's unlikely I will receive them in person before I have to return, but for the remaining albums I am planning on buying them in a shop and then perhaps transporting them myself in a checked in bag - which hopefully should be cheaper than EMS.\n\nIf my albums number is very high, since I don't have an actual number, let's say 60, do I have to declare it to customs? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso if anyone has any advice/tips/tricks for GO for fansign events (getting joiners prior to info release, what giveaways do you usually find to be both financially okay for GOM but still beneficial for joiners for helping by joining), if it's actually better to ship from korea and how to do it with minimal language knowledge, etc it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEDIT: I'm from the UK",

In the US, you have an $800 personal exemption (so if the total of all the goods you are bringing back is under $800 and it is for your personal use or a gift, you can bring it back duty free.)  And if you are traveling with family, your exemptions combine, so the exemption for a family of four would be $3,200.  The next $1,000 (per person) is tariffed at 3%, and above that, the duty rate is whatever % is specified for that item.  \n\nMore details here --&gt; https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-246?language=en\\_US",

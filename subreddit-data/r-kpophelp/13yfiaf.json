    "postText": "Does anyone know any accounts that breakdown Stray Kids songs in a similar way to bulletproof-korean does on Tumblr? Doesn't matter what social it's on bc I'll make accounts if I have to. I'm currently learning Korean and absolutely love BTS but they're not the only group I stan and I'd like to learn with some of those other groups in mind too.\n\nSo aside from BTS, the other groups I stan are Stray Kids, P1harmony, TXT, Ateez, Seventeen, NCT (all units), Xdinary Heroes. But I'm also not picky and love a good kpop group so if you know any accounts but not from the groups I stan, please still suggest it bc I might end up stanning. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I have done lessons for Stray Kids, Ateez, TXT, Enhypen, and The Boyz (which looking at it I need to add the last few I did for them on there)",

    "postText": "Hello, I ordered a candybong on May 24th, and my orders status says \"departure from inward office of exchange\" for like the past 5 days now. I was wondering if this has also happened to anyone else before, because this is my first time I have ever ordered from the jypshop. And I'm hoping my order it makes it before June 21",

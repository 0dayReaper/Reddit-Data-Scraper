    "postText": "Disclaimer: Could apply for normal orders as well as POBs and not only pre-orders or albums. This is a genuine question and I don\u2019t mean any shade when I say \u201dless popular\u201d, perhaps the correct word is \u201dless in-demand\u201d, especially in this scenario where Winter and Karina are the most in-demand members of aespa.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad thing if a distribution pattern like low demand first out exists, but I think it\u2019s a bit wrong for descriptions to say e.g. \u2019RANDOM (1 out of 4)\u2019 if this isn\u2019t really the case - and that is where my gripe lies. So these are my observations but I would love to hear others\u2019 experiences with this, especially since I don\u2019t really have much experience buying albums haha.\n\n\nI don\u2019t collect albums religiously, but I will buy albums of groups if I enjoyed most or all of the songs in said album.  I pre-ordered two \u2019MY WORLD (Intro vers)\u2019 so they\u2019d be random upon arrival. After scrolling through TikTok I\u2019ve noticed that most people who pre-ordered one single album received a Giselle version. In fact, someone who ordered from the same store as I did pre-ordered only one Intro vers. and received a Giselle, her other one was a Poster vers. of Ning. \n\nI picked up the albums today and since I only ordered two I got Ning and Giselle. Ning is my bias so I am very happy, and am happy with everything else I received or would receive :)\n\nTLDR; Is it truly \u2019randomized\u2019 when ordering or is there a recognizable pattern in how they distribute albums or POBs? Specifically for albums like aespa\u2019s MY WORLD (with 4 different member covers), or a POB photocard. I would like to say that I see these low-demand first out patterns for POBs also, like for Red Velvet? My friend is a diehard RV stan and usually only gets Wendy or Yeri POBs for 1 pre-order album, but I could be hallucinating and I\u2019m not an album collector so I can\u2019t come to a conclusion.\n\nEDIT: Mostly asking for pre-order experiences if other people experience POBs and/or album member versions pattern distribution.",

They wont give duplicates if you buy more than one.\n\n The shops do it so everything gets sold in the end. There are too many times where they are left with unsold albums from \"least popular\" members or umpopular albums versions and dont know what to do with the stock. Therefore they only sell \"random\" version to the fan and the fan already assume the \"risk\" of not getting the preferred version bc there is no selection to chose from.",

Odds are they will give you the less in-demand thing (whatever the thing happens to be) to ensure everything gets bought. For instance, if you see a shop selling Blue Hour albums \"random\" odds are you're never getting an R version. In the case of aespa, if you order a random member version album, expect to get Giselle because she is difficult to sell and an easy way to get rid of the album as stock is with this faux random sale.\n\nThis happens with pre-order benefits like PCs as well. I know many shops that only send out the least popular members and resell the popular ones on different websites.\n\nThe shops aim to maximize profit and minimize stock. This is how they do it.",

    "postText": "There was this music video my mom always showed me when I was a child around 2012-2014 (not sure if it was released then or earlier). It was a girl group song and the music video setting was a bakery of some sort with lots of white in the foreground. At the end of the music video there's balloons. I think it was a very cute type of song as well. That's all I remember.",

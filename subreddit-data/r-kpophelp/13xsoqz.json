Idols have to get there early to get ready, then every group has to do a soundcheck/stage run, then they perform for 3 minutes while waiting for everyone else to also perform, followed by appearing altogether at the end of the program. It's just not worth it for Blackpink. \n\nWhat Blackpink and Jisoo did for the latest comebacks was going to the music show, recording their performances and then leaving immediately. And then the program just airs their pre-recorded performances. So they spend way less time doing nothing at the building than other groups. \n\nBut obviously not everyone will be allowed to do what Blackpink gets to do. Usually the music shows help with exposure and just general attention of Korean public. But obviously groups like BTS and Blackpink don't need that as much, everyone interested in K-pop already know who they are and check out their new releases. Hence why they promote their songs less.",

If they do appear on a show, it is only for 1-2 weeks.\n\nMusic shows in Korea have a low viewer audience. For popular groups, their time and effort would be better spent on other events or preparing for concerts. For groups that aren't at the top, music shows are pretty much the only way to gain national visibility on tv.\n\nI'm not sure about the interview thing, they usually interview big comebacks and the possible show winners.\n\n3rd gen and older means they have been active for quite a while and likely have other things going on, so they don't have to rely on music show appearances.",

I feel it's more of a YG thing than a generation thing\n\n\n* 3rd gen off the top of my head: Jimin for his solo promotions, Seventeen, BTOB, Viviz, EXO\n\n\n* 2nd gen examples: Highlight (the only year they had 0 promotion was 2019), SNSD (we are one), 2PM, Super Junior, TVXQ\n\n\nIt's just that 2nd gen groups are less active in general, SuJu and Highlight are I think the only groups doing at least one group or solo cb a year (edit: maybe Shinee too)",

Korean music shows have a 'no hags' rule /j\n\nAs others have said, music shows are time-consuming, so a lot of senior artists will cut down on those.\n\nIn general, senior groups will usually also be more focused on subunit and solo activities instead of group activities, so comebacks are less frequent in general. We're basically halfway through 2023 and yet a lot of 3rd gen acts have yet to release something, so music shows right now won't have many 3rd gen and older idols participating",

    "postText": "That song is so addictive to me with it's energy and power.. Also I would prefer if it had a full fledged chorus rather than just a beat drop. In Guerilla I also love the rock influence mixed with the powerful beat loud fast paced sound so some songs with any of those qualities would be great!",

They kind of remind me of Ateez a little bit:\n\nBreathe Again, debut stage, live singing: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsjAmt3QJY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsjAmt3QJY)\n\nBobbin MV: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyvfpxHfGEI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyvfpxHfGEI)\n\nWill Make A Mistake Halloween Performance: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xBL\\_RdUUy4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xBL_RdUUy4)\n\nEdit: Just thought of a couple more groups:\n\nB.A.P - Power: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBSaX3jvyEc](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBSaX3jvyEc)\n\nPink Fantasy - Poison (it even has screamo): [www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Iv\\_Ym6UlVs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Iv_Ym6UlVs)",

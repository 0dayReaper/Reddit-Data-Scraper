            "comment": "you won't as the VIP package is tied to the original buyer's information. but you can set it up with the original buyer where they can pick up the VIP badge for you at the venue, or you can see if the buyer would be okay with sending over a photocopy of their ID. Never tried the second option, but I've heard the first option a lot! \n\n\nThere is a small chance the concert promoter can get you the VIP benefits if you explain your situation.",

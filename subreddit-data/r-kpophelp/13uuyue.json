Pasties, tape, building in support cups into the costume/attaching a bra and even modifying a bra to stay hidden are all possible solutions. We also use double sided fashion tape to keep things down that might flop away or fall off of shoulders (a popular option in a lot of us theatres is topstic brand toupee tape bc it's pre cut and sticks well through sweating).  When you know someone is dancing, you really need to think about how they're moving to decide what is the best solution. It's honestly not that hard to contain an A or B cup which is where a lot of idols tend to fall. Tbh I haven't worked with all that many dancers who were bigger than that in the US, either. Most of the dancers I've worked with have added padding if they look bigger. I've sewn a lot of padding into bras lol",

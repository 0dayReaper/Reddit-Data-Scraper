            "comment": "I don't know if you're just looking for girls groups but their concept/music/choreography kinda makes me think of early Seventeen, like Pretty U/Adore You/Mansae eras. On a related note, Seventeen's counterpart girl group Pristin also had a similar-ish sound, but only had two title tracks - Weewoo &amp; We Like \n\nThey also kinda remind me of old Apink and SNSD, maybe something like My My/NoNoNo for Apink and Baby Baby/Girls' Generation for SNSD. I think for these it's more the energy that's similar rather than the music itself \n\nOr as others mentioned, fromis_9 - something like Pitapat or Fun! or Love Bomb",

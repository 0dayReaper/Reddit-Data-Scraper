            "comment": "Generally, no. But I have done so with songs of groups that I stan, namely pentagon. The only other group I\u2019ve done this with is BTS recently. I always liked their song pied piper, and I saw a comment about the songs meaning so it made me curious. I was thinking no way BTS was brave enough to say that in their song so I checked out the English lyrics, and I was pleasantly surprised. Love that song even more now. The same thing happened with fake love. \n\nFor pentagon I was in love with dr Bebe ever since seeing the choreography, so I checked out the MV w English lyrics as well and needless to say I fell deeper in love. While watching a pentagon interview, I heard Hui (the writer) talking about the double meaning of his song \u201cdaisy\u201d, so I checked out the English lyrics for the full story. The real meaning of this song completely surprised me cos I initially thought it was a happy go lucky love song based on the name and the way they performed the choreo on variety shows. I was wrong haha. The song is more about the duality of the beauty and the pain love causes",

            "comment": "You asked what drives me to explore these hidden depths, well I suppose it\u2019s knowing that I\u2019ll find something amazing if I dig. And no offence to kpop music but I generally don\u2019t expect much lyrically from them, and I\u2019m okay with that cos I\u2019m more of a casual listener to kpop. The vibes of the songs are immaculate. With epik high, I know tablo is a genius haha and I don\u2019t think he could make a song with no deeper meaning even if he tried \ud83d\ude02",

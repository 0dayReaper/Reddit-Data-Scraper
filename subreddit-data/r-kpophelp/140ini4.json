I would think that the calculation process includes breath, stability, support, range, tone, etc of the singer, but literally how do you put those together to find a letter based tier? Can someone explain? Thanks!",

            "comment": "A lot of the people putting artists into \"tiers\" are people claiming to have experience and then saying stuff that doesn't make any sense. For example, a great vocalist TO ME can have an incredibly small range but execute their notes so cleanly and precise that I'd still consider them amazing. There is also a lot of confusion when it comes to stability for example. Stability can mean so many things when describing an idol. Are they just talking about their stability to sing notes whilst dancing? In that case, their physical fitness and stamina plays just as big of a part as actual vocal technique. Or are we talking about the stability of their notes and pitch is in a studio setting? In that case technical aspects like correct breathing, pitch control, etc are vital. Also, are we taking style and their role in the group into consideration? If we value style a lot, does that mean vocalists like Taeyeon who don't sing very stylistically are bad?\n\nI don't wanna shit on anyone's passion for singing but even people who are studying music/singing and/or have massive amounts of singing experience can't OBJECTIVELY rank anyone, much less a person with \"only\" three years of experience. Even a SUBJECTIVE ranking based on singing ABILITY takes a ton of knowledge in the field. I don't feel able to rank based on technical ability, even if I have training because I am not a vocal coach who studied vocal pedagogy intensely and my own experience is related to a very specific way of singing. An opera singer will have very different technical expectations compared to a jazz singer for example. Are we judging these idols, who are very much trained for a very specific type of singing in an overarching way? Are we judging Idols based on how well they would do in other types of singing? \n\nResponsible, knowledgeable vocalists wouldn't put idols into tiers because it contradicts a lot of the knowledge you get through years of vocal training. Tiers suggest a universally agreed upon skill level for each tier and ways that that skill level is determined. Yet I've never seen a single one of these tier ranking channels specify in great detail what aspects they are weighing in what ways. Saying \"I base this off of breath support and pitch\" doesn't count because lets face it, the idols they are ranking have far too little unfiltered, unprocessed, raw live vocals to adequately judge anything. How should I judge someone's voice when 90% of the footage we have of them is singing similar songs in similar styles with backtrack and music playing? \n\nAnother thing is style vs technique. How do these channels value each of these attributes? If you heavily prefer stylised vocals, of course you will value that more than technical aspects. How is Ros\u00e9 a low D tier according to some and a high A tier to others? That's the reason. These rankings aren't factual, they are entirely based on personal preference.\n\nAs a classically trained singer of 15+ years, my advice is to do research on what vocal training is made up of so that you can get a feel for vocal artistry and to just listen to singers that make you happy, because at the end of the day, Kpop idols are mainly simply entertainers, whether they have an amazing control over their voice or not. As long as you feel entertained, they did their job well :)",

            "comment": "Impossible. There are many factors that can make a great vocalist. Technical skill, born with a beautiful tone, great at conveying emotion, but just within technique there are many different qualities that can make a vocalist. Few have all of the above. Many singers and the audience usually prefer stylistic singing over pure technical skill. Is hitting a higher note more impressive and difficult? Vocal runs? Musicality and ability to improvise? Good at chest voice, head voice, falsetto, mixing? All of them or just some of them? Versatility across genres? \n\nIn the end singing is about what the listener likes. You can say X singer is a weak or bad singer, but if people like their voice, you could argue they by definition are a very good singer.",

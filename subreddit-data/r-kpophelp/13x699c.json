It took a bit over 3 weeks from release before it shipped, and once it shipped it was about 3 days to get to me. So a total of ~4 weeks after the album released until it was in my hands.\n\nNgl I went and just bought one from Target after a couple days, might as well support the girls a bit more.",

And they are increasingly sketchy about restock date. \n\nIt's infuriating especially because I was in Korea in May and both ktown4u physical stores in Seoul I went to (and every other kpop shop including the cheap ones on Myeongdong subway station) had FML standard albums in stock.",

Post things that you think will be upvoted, rather than (exactly) what you want to say.\n\nWhen you have plenty karma like I, you can just take a karma hit whenever you please, cause it can't hurt you anymore.\n\nThat being said, every sub you are new to, you may first want to take it easy and get a few dozen karma points via posting the typical jokes of that sub, or other things you may not necessarily want to post, but people like to upvote.\n\nI got downvoted a lot on /r/singing on my very first post, because people there weren't accepting of people who love to sing as a hobby, with no desire to improve. Either way, that caused me to not be able to post there anymore and only be able to comment once every 10 min or so. Of course I left that sub immediately.\n\nEdit: FYI, that type of behavior is called \"gatekeeping\". Basically it means someone is standing at the gate of the sub, and comments that a user or their post is not welcome. You probably want to avoid doing that, as I found some subs take punishing gatekeepers very seriously, like /r/BestOf. It is an immediate ban there for your first offense, even if you just question if a post should be there, like I did.",

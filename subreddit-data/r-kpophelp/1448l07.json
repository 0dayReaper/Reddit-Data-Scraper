    "postText": "Hi! Ive been looking for a music video for aggges. I used to adore this song as a kid and I really can't find it anymore. Please help\ud83e\udd0d\nThe music video is about a male singer who has really long silver hair, sometimes in a half-updo bun (?) and he looks really majestic lol. There MIGHT be a fight scene on the top of a building and I think there is also a really pretty asian girl (who might be a princess) who falls in love with him. This is all i remember: i hope someone knows which one is it!\ud83e\udd79\u2728 tyty",

The official MVs for the OST didn't have the scene you described, but [this FMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSklZKKQYm8) kinda fits.",

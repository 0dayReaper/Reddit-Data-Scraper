    "postText": "can someone pls help me find a short youtube drama? it was about a girl that did streams of her decorating her fav group merch like photocard etc, and her mom was kind of disappointed with her because she didn\u2019t work nor had a job. her streams began to be more popular and someday her fav idol enter to one of her streams and he likes is very much and found it healing. so then the girl goes to a camping for relaxing I guess and the idol goes to the same exact camping, they had a little interacting but she didn\u2019t recognize him (he did in fact recognize her) then he wrote a song about their encounter. I remember that this was some kind of \u201cpropaganda\u201d to promote a new kpop-like app such as vlive, it was on youtube and was very very short, like 2/3 capitules.",

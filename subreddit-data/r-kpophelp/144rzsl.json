And now people use it to mean \u201cthis makes me think of another thing.\u201d",

            "comment": "The term actually comes from media study where you might see a character coded in a certain way that might resemble characteristics of a real life group of people. Most of the times its non human characters\n\nthis is a crazy example, but as someone who is black we have fun with this one: People say Knuckles from sonic is black coded lol (\"characters that aren't black but definitely are\"). things like his hair look like dreadlocks, and the colours of his clothing being the same as a lot of carribbean countries national colours, and there was a knuckles rap. All of these things are pretty abstract commonly \"black\" characteristics or culture, so the connection seems kinda transient and like a eureka moment when you make them - like everyone sorta goes ... oh yeah! that makes sense for some reasons. Other characters like this include Piccolo from dragon ball lmao\n\nObviously this can get problematic, when people start to attribute uncomfortable stereotypes as coding (for example) aggression or intimidating stature as \"black coding\". [There are characters from Steven Universe that people believe are black-coded and they're muscular women that have anger issues..](https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2016/08/steven-universe-100-bismuth-undermined-by-racial-coding/) Same way someone mentioned \"queer coding\" can be problematic.\n\nits made for characters, but twitter uses it for real people for some reason. For that post was about groups that feel coded like other groups. So those that share a lot of characteristics with others in a transient way that makes you like wow that is very very similar! like one group was made from the blueprint of another (twice/snsd) etc",

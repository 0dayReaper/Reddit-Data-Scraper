There was a Korean post about celebs who smell \u2014 I can't find the source, but the earliest I've seen it spread was in 2004. ([Over here](https://cafe.daum.net/klovek82/5xRc/40521?q=%EA%B9%80%EC%9E%AC%EC%9B%90+%EC%9D%B4%ED%9A%A8%EB%A6%AC+%EC%9E%85%EB%83%84%EC%83%88); there's a bunch of irrelevant stuff before and after it, but it's in there.) In the post they have a whole list of stars with bad breath which includes Rain, with a comment stating his stink is \"a little severe.\" A [Daum Cafe comment](https://cafe.daum.net/ok1221/DO1q/45260?q=%EB%83%84%EC%83%88%EB%82%98%EB%8A%94%EC%97%B0%EC%98%88%EC%9D%B8%EB%93%A4) (on page one) posted in 2009 also says that Rain's bad breath is \"famous.\" So, it seems that the rumor of Rain having bad bad breath has existed longer than one might think.\n\n(...I don't know why I'm writing so sincerely about this. \ud83d\ude43)",

    "postText": "I put over supportive in quotes since it\u2019s kind of bittersweet considering being supportive is inherently a good thing.\n\n\nBut by over supportive I mean, oddly supportive to the point where it\u2019s kind of deluded, similar to the vein of a mom going to a kid who just started walking \u201comg little tommy you\u2019re AMAZING\u201d (not to downplay the fact that having your kid walk is a great moment, but you know what I mean, it\u2019s exaggerated).  Like the supporters will be going X is an amazing actress, X did phenomenally doing Y, etc, when it was all pretty standard, although not bad.  \n\nSupporting is fine, but idk, I feel like the average person isn\u2019t that aggressive with it; like I\u2019m a fan of people, but the most I do is cheer them on, I\u2019m definitely not going to exaggerate their performance, if I think it\u2019s standard I\u2019ll acknowledge it\u2019s standard if asked about my opinion.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it, I hope the reasoning behind this post doesn\u2019t get skewed.  Im not saying these people aren\u2019t talented, etc, but it\u2019s pretty obvious that a lot of fans very aggressively over exaggerate their performance (ie \u201cX is an angel, flawless, so much talent for her first time doing Y. It\u2019s incredible\u201d in instances where it really isn\u2019t like that), and I\u2019m curious about the psychology behind it - do they actually believe it? Or is there some other subconscious driving force, you think? Maybe they\u2019re just incredibly young and don\u2019t know better, idk\n\nAlso asking for the majority since there is obviously an array of driving forces which lead to this sort of reaction",

Since when did this topic became so dense? If I stan someone then I praise them, what's an angel lol, for me it's an umbrella term I use to define anyone I find pretty. \"So much talent for her first time doing Y. It's incredible\" Isn't this a standard comment of a fan for their idol? You might not like her performance but I did. \nIdk about young part cuz I am not 60 yr old but as a 20 year old, I don't think that calling your idol angel, flawless and incredible is over supportive. Maybe sometimes it can be but majority of kpop stans don't mean literal angels who are descending from heaven and would provide peace to your soul. Flawless doesn't mean that idols are ideal, it's again a very normal term used for compliments. \n\n&gt; Also asking for the majority since there is obviously an array of driving forces which lead to this sort of reaction. \n\nMaybe because you are a fan? That's the driving force?",

They're expected to debut and grow in their own. So it's exciting for fans, to see their fav get gradually better at music over time. So, the whole idol experience feels like raising a kid.\n\nThen, we have other phenomena on kpop like survival shows, where viewers are led to believe ( yes we all know these are rigged lineups), that their votes will launch their favs into their career.\n\nBasically, because people believe they have individual agency over their favs' success, fans get positive feedback and keep sending luxury gifts and such too. Then, the idols will even take Twitter photos wearing the fan gifts, and bam! Even more positive reinforcement.\n\nBasically, it's like a friend or kid thanking you for all the emotional and monetary support.",

So you\u2019re saying  the illusion of a connection with the idol has something to do with it (parasocial relationship)?  I actually didn\u2019t think about that and connect those two dots, even knowing what parasocial relationships are",

            "comment": "I'm not gonna claim to be a psychology expert, but speculation based on personal experience/friendship with people who've been overinvested in various fandoms over the years, I think it's often:\n\n1. Some of them are just super young, yeah. Emotions run really high at a certain age, and if you have the type of personality that naturally wants to \"stan\" (because I've found that the stan impulse is impossible to explain to people who just don't become fans of things like that), I can see people easily getting carried away. It can also make them feel good to be part of a group if their whole fandom is participating in stuff like excessive praise and hyping their faves up. \n2. Some of them are looking to fill a void in their lives and the intense stanning/support gives them some sense of purpose. Similarly, a lot of people get deeply into fandom if they're going through a lot of stress in another area of their lives, looking for a distraction. They end up becoming so invested in their idols/celebrities/fictional characters (I've seen it) that it's like their own sense of self-worth gets tied to their fandom. \n\nI think that the kind of transactional explanation that the other comment suggested makes sense as well.",

Come on, it\u2019s ok to say it was a bad stage or X was not in their best day.

Kpop is designed to make fans very invested in idols due to the idon-fan relationship where we know the idol's background, we know (bits of) their personality, we know their strengths and weaknesses, we know their journey and dreams and aspirations (basically within what they share with fans) and so when they do things, it just hits harder.\n\nSome people do go too far with it and are unable to be objective.",

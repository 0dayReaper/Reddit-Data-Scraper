After learning this fact the fans felt relief that the company went with AB6IX. \n\nAB6IX also has a group nickname, that writers/editors, and also other entertainers or senior idol hosts might call them by (I think I\u2019ve heard different SUJU members call them by it when they host and ab6ix are guests, and also JaeJae).  That name is Yeppi and it is a wordplay between \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cab6ix\u201d (abbi). It\u2019s so cute.",

                            "comment": "He was scouted by the BNM Director at a JYP showcase and they contacted him after he left JYP but I believe he still had to audition and enter as a trainee/sign a trainee contract. But he was encouraged by the CEO to take the producer role in his group so he joined the company as a trainee with expectations to be a producer as well. There\u2019s an informative [fanmade video](https://youtu.be/zMUmWLHFO04) that compiled some of his clips talking about it. He sang [Ride by Somo](https://youtu.be/5082NM1H-io) for his BNM audition though which means they still probably wanted him to sing in their boy group too. That song is so explicit lol.\n\nOh yeah another fun fact.\n\nThere was another trainee who trained with AB6ix members predebut that could produce, but he couldn\u2019t go on P101 S2 due to a leg injury. Some ppl speculate he was supposed to debut with AB6IX with Sihoon for an OT7 group, but then he left BNM, likely because he couldn\u2019t wait for them to finish MXM/W1 promotions or for BNM to debut their first boy group.  He ended up joining APP.Y Ent and joined P101X with that company. His name was Myunghoon and he also helped Woong write Moondance (he is 2nd credits on that song). Myunghoon also participated in writing/composing the song he released with Midam.\n\n So early on it seems like Rhymer was collecting a small pool of trainees who could produce lol. I\u2019m sure his next boy group will also have members who can produce too.",

I heard in Korean ab6ix sounds like \u201cabc\u201d.. ix = 9 in Roman numerals so in another way ab6ix = ab69 if you have an immature mind like me. This name has maturity potential. Fans can also use the suffix-esque part to have fun with it eg blue6ix, band6ix, PD6ix.\n\nPeople make fun of it for looking like a password but this name is pretty clever.",

I remember seeing a clip of the staff telling them their name is Boys Don't Cry and Sihun was just like \"oh......... okay......\". None of them dared to question the name lmao I just know AB6IX would have rejected it outright or at least proposed another name if they did that to them. \n\n\nThe wordplay is really fun and you know straight away that it's about AB6IX. All the fan accounts on Twitter have a 6ix too so it's so easy to spot ABNEW. \n\n\nYup yup I'm glad their name works so well for searching because more \"normal\" names usually don't get good hits unless you're famous. At least its gonna be easy to search them no matter what",

The fastest person in history to pass was Lee Know of Stray Kids at 2 weeks. Second fastest was Momo in 3 months, third fastest Jinyoung at 8 months. All other idols took at least a year. \n\n- Stray Kids\u2019 God\u2019s Menu was not originally going to be the title track, or even on the album. Plans were already in place for a music video, concept photos, and marketing for another song, when at the last minute, Changbin ended up showing an early version of God\u2019s Menu to Hyunjin. Hyunjin convinced him to go to JYP himself and ask if they could change the title track last minute, and he let them.",

The only other two odd audition stories in sm I know of were Taeyong and Choi Minho being almost stalked and harassed to audition for sm\n\nThe makeup of the group SHINee was a complete secret. No one knew who was in it or when they\u2019d debut. After the fact I read that Taemin was almost put in Exo while one of Exos member was to be in SHINee, I don\u2019t remember the name but I think it stated with a C. I think also both those groups were initially being reviewed to see who was to be put in SHINee. The ones who weren\u2019t chosen would debut as Exo.",

Shindong wasn't very interested to have a lot of parts in Super Junior's songs, because he was aiming to be a comedian and thought SuJu would be just a temporary step on his path towards that.

They would constantly harass his family and wife because they thought it was impossible for him to graduate college in 3 years. It got to the point where they would heckle at him in the streets and that the actual University had to make a statement that he did indeed attend their institution.",

They even had a MTV Diary.   \n\n\nLuna of f(x) actually auditioned to and got into SM with her dancing, not her singing, and Amber was originally supposed to be a vocalist, but they switched her to rapping last minute because they needed a main rapper for the group.   \nJeongyeon of Twice and Somin of KARD are distant relatives.   \n\n\nJueun of Dia was actually Dia's assistant manager before she was added to the group.   \n\n\nAdding onto your Taeyeon fact, It seems that every SNSD song Taeyeon doesn't like becomes a big hit (she also hated Hoot and Lion Heart)   \n\n\nLime of Hello Venus, Kyungri of 9muses, Seola and EXY of WJSN, and Woohee of Dalshabet were supposed to debut together in a group called Viva Girls, but their agency went bankrupt so the debut never happened.",

New Jack Swing was invented  in the late 80's by producer Teddy Riley and this music style stayed popular up untill 1992/1993. Teddy Riley who would later on also produce \"The Boys\" by SNSD.",

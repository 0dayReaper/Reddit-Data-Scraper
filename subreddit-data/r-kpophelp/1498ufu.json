    "postText": "SKZ just released a teaser for their new lightstick (I can imagine it will be released soon along with some other merch in time for their upcoming fanmeet); unfortunately, it looks like the compass will be attach on instead of 'broken' and spinny; and as it will have a screen, it'll probably more expensive too.\nI preferred the older version and am wanting to buy it instead of the newer one, but I seems like everywhere is sold out. Does anyone know here I can buy the older version (not AliExpress), even Ebay is fine, as long as the lightstick is official.\nAny help would be appreciated xx",

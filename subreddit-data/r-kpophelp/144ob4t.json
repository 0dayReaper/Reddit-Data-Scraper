    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking. I\u2019m a STAY and, inevitably, have come across shippers that romantically ship members together like Lee Know/Han, Hyunjin/Felix, etc- and notice that many arguments against romantic shipping claim that the way the members act with each other is mostly fanservice. Being in the Kpop community for about 5 ish years now I\u2019ve often wondered why it is that fanservice is considered acceptable and actively encouraged whilst idols are likewise afraid of coming out due to Korea\u2019s conservative public and the parasocial relationship fans often bae with their idols. This is by no means assigning a sexuality to any idol, more so saying that inevitably amongst the idol community there will be LGBT members. So the point of this post is, why is it that idols that are openly LGBT (ie Holland) receive so much hatred while those who aren\u2019t and act romantically with their same-sex members are praised? Why is it that a label can completely change the way fans view idols? I also wonder if the same would happen if a member from a well-known group were to come out, like a BTS member for example. Considering Holland came out early in his career before he had  any sort of notoriety, I wonder if his honesty from the beginning prompted people to view him as only his sexuality? What are your opinions?",

            "comment": "My opinion is that this seems to be viewed from a mostly Western lens. Westerners judging a country and culture by their own will almost always get this a bit wrong. SK is more conservative, and being \"out\" isn't widely accepted. It's as simple as that. At the same time, their culture is a bit more open to skinship than would be as acceptable in a lot of Western countries. Skinship in SK isn't indicative of one's sexuality/sexual preferences. It's important to understand the cultural and societal differences in these things.",

I am East Asian myself and live in Malaysia so I for sure understand some of the culture surrounding LGBT, but what I am wondering specifically is why fans (including Korean/EA fans) love to ship same-sex members together and shun idols that are actually LGBT. Is it the fact that they can speculate? Is it that their relationship status is unconfirmed so fans feel that they are more accessible? May be because the main demographic of these groups are fans of the opposite gender, so a female fan may be upset upon finding out that the male idol she loves doesn\u2019t like women. I don\u2019t know though. Perhaps in the future a very famous idol could come out and we would all see the response to it.",

I know many people IRL who watch yaoi, read BL mangas, watch BL dramas etc. but when they meet an actual gay person they either fetishize them or outright reject them. It just boils down to they like the \"idea\" of people being gay but not people **actually** being gay. They only care about their ideal fantasy and reject anything that doesn't fit it. \n\nIt's a disgusting sentiment, but there are also people who think straight guys being affectionate and all is cute because they're still considered \"real men\", but the moment they are actually gay that's when they stop considering them \"real men\".",

The thought that stereotyped gay relationships are cute and/or hot, but that it doesn\u2019t translate into accepting real gay people as... people.\n\n In some fandoms, the fetishization can get incredibly bad, like in some fujoshi spaces (in the West, I will never forgive nor forget the yaoi paddle).",

            "comment": "Personally i think especially with knetz they may view fanservice like this as a joke, like they find its \"cute\" that their biases interact like that and everything but if it turned out to be true, they wouldnt support it. I know we're talking abt very different things here but for example, Red Velvets Joy was once in the show \"We Got Married\" alongside with BTOBs Sungjae, for the longest time a lot of fans shipped both idols and thought they should be together, however there was also a ton of backlash from both fandoms just by the ideia that it might be true. \n\nRegarding the way a label can completely change the way fans views idols sometimes it has to do with their media training for example, so they often will tell idols what or not to say regarding certain topics and everything. Personally speaking, if a well known idol were to come out i dont think the difference would be much bigger, they would probably still face a major backlash and probably withdraw from the group, however, they would probably have the support of the international fanbase seeing as they seem to be more supportive of the lgbt community in general.",

            "comment": "Honestly, nobody knows what'd happen if someone famous and backed up by international and Korean fandoms were to come out, simply because it hasn't happened (for well established idols in current times I mean). There's also a huge amount of factors that would play into that, but one thing is for sure; nobody would risk their career by revealing such personal information, it'd serve no purpose for them whatsoever. Even Dispatch was like \"nah, we ain't exposing same sex couples, that'd be a dick move\" and went back to stalking actors instead. \n\nSo yes, statistically, there must be a good amount of queer people in the industry, but I doubt they'd want to share it. Although I can think of a few people that've done and said literally everything to hint at certain things that are kinda impossible to interpret differently, so who knows, maybe one day.",

It could be unfamiliar or rare to some younger people, but many of us do unfortunately have to be indirect and let people pick up what we're laying down. Hell, by this point I even have a small mental list of these kinds of things, just cause they really stand out to me and it's hard to forget things that stick in the mind like that.",

            "comment": "My take on this is that the fans who enjoy this kind of fanservice feel assured that the idols are straight and eternally single (because they're marketed as always available) so they view the fanservice as just a demonstration of closeness between the group members or as a way of imagining themselves in the other member's place.  The fans don't feel threatened by this behavior because they have convinced themselves that the idols are straight and are only there for them, which is a stupid delusion that we need to stop normalizing.  The other important thing here is that skinship isn't always considered romantic or sexual in Korea.  Things that idols do with each other might be seen by a westerner and they'll think the idols are romantically involved or something, when in reality, they're just close friends.  Idols will hug each other, hold hands, and even kiss each other's cheeks and stuff in a completely platonic way, and I've never seen anyone be bothered by that.",

            "comment": "I think in general, all over the world, lots of things are more accepted if done by straight people than queer people. That includes skinship in SK. I just replied to a comment in this thread, so i'll paste a part of it here:\n\n\\~I constantly see comments under ship videos saying \"Oh I hope tell finally tell us they're dating\" (or \"when will Dispatch expose them?\", which is horrifying and not funny at all), and i'm just here thinking \"This closeness you're so happy to consume will 100% not be permitted to be shown if they do come out\". Variety shows won't put hearts on screen and romantic bgm when two idols are acting cute if one of them is queer, they will just cut the scene and may even not invite them again, because suddenly this action that is friendly and platonic between everyone else will be sexualized when a queer person does it...\\~\r  \n\r  \nAn example is the difference of acceptance of Harry Styles and Sam Smith. Both are white English pop singers who are incredibly famous worldwide. Sam Smith is a queer non-binary person who receives an enormous endless amount of hatred, even though they were a global success before coming out; whenever Sam does *anything*, it's deeply scrutinized, sexualized and demonized. Harry Styles is a cis straight man who receives an enormous amount of praise whenever he does anything remotely outside of \"masculinity\", like wearing a dress on a fashion magazine or painting his nails. One is seeing as fun and adventurous, and the other is seen as a menace to society who's trying to corrupt \"normal people\".\n\nQueer people are constantly sexualized, fetishized, and every action of care done by a queer person would fall onto those adjectives as well. The reason Disney and children/teen's media refuse to show any queerness is because parents and many cultures claim kids are too young to watch something \"sexual\", when the reality is that the only thing being shown on screen would be a queer person existing... So simply put, fanservice/shipping is only allowed or played up by companies because the idols are \"straight\" (and straight is in quotes because that is simply the assumption companies sell us, whether or not it's true for each individual idol); they want to make money because they're capitalists, and fetishizing and fantasy sells. They're the companies that, at the exact same time, don't allow their idols to bring rainbow flags onto stage when fans give them during concerts, or cut conversations about queerness during fancalls, or are very strict over the opinions idols can give about LGBTQ+.\n\nLike it was done for hundreds of years in many countries (and still done to this day in the majority of places), queer people sometimes are able to communicate amongst ourselves through subtle wording and imagery that signal \"hey, i'm one of you!\", so hopefully idols who are queer can find and support each other. (ideally all queer idols would form a solidarity coalition and all come out on the same day, so none of them would get all of the hate alone, and fans would be like \"oh there's at least one queer person per group, so unless we accept them all our faves would have to disband\" lol /jokingbutnotreally).\n\nAnd as for Holland, yes his honesty has caused people to ignore his incredible musicality, but it's also worth noting that 1. his honesty is also what has allowed him to create genuine, vulnerable, beautiful art; 2. that would happen no matter when he came out because he is literally one of the very few out kpop artists rn; and 3. he freaking built his career from the ground up completely independently, which is honestly beautiful and provides a lot of hope.\n\nThis is honestly a very nuanced topic, that has so many aspects and perspectives to it, as well as different cultural contexts. so now, i'm going to go listen to Holland and MRSHLL.",

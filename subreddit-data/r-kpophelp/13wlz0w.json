    "postText": "TXT signed with Republic Records in 2019, TWICE in 2020, last year JYP brought Stray Kids and Itzy into RR as well. I remember (G)Idle also signed with them, but honestly I don't know if the contract stands.\r  \n\r  \nMy point is, Republic Records is the biggest record label in the US, and every time a K-pop group signed with them it always came with the same speech: \"Republic Records will support X group and provide support for their activities in the US \", but in my opinion honestly, it doesn't seem like Republic Records is doing much for their groups. I'm not American, so I could be getting the wrong perception, but I can't see any difference between groups that are signed to RR and any other K-pop group when they go to the US. I don't know why signing with the biggest US label if they don't seem to do anything much.\r  \n\r  \nBut as I said above, I'm looking from the outside and I could be wrong. So I ask the following question: after all, what exactly was the work that Republic Records did for the K-pop groups it signed a contract with? Is there anything that RR did that was really helpful for these groups? In your opinion is RR a good label for K-pop idols or could they do a better job?",

This year seems a bit better but tbh, RR seems to forget SKZ exist until its time to use their name into their roster. Other than distributing SKZ albums in the US, which they fumble really badly, I do not see much effort from RR side for SKZ. Oddinary is not even available nowadays, and it is not even an old album.",

                    "comment": "Honestly, for me Republic Records' work specifically with JYP groups is the worst among all labels and their K-pop groups. Other groups have already had their songs sent to radio stations, the song Wanner placed Fifty Fifty on the soundtrack of Barbie's Live action and Aespa on the soundtrack of Tretis. HYBE groups, including TXT who are also signed to RR, often collaborate with North American artists. TXT went to coach last year, now he's returning to headline this year. Newjeans with less than a year of debut is already going to coachela too, in addition to having received a great investment in Spotify playlists with Ditto and OMG. These are all practices that aim to broaden the audience of these groups in the US. Now with the JYP groups, Republic Records only seems to care about getting the most money out of their fans, and even that they don't do right, just look at the constant problem of restocking albums for both TWICE and Stray Kids. TWICE and Itzy released songs in English, which in theory should serve to reach a larger audience in the country, but they had 0 promotion. Stray Kids has had two #1's on the billboard in the past 200 years and only managed one post on Universal Music's Instagram. Other than that, all the activities of JYP groups in the US seem to be just to please the fans of these groups, but don't seem to have any object to promote them beyond that. I honestly don't understand, Stray Kids and TWICE must be the two groups with the biggest fandoms in the US after BTS and BP, I can't think of why they get less investment than groups that don't have half their popularity in the country.",

Probably would not work, as you said, the difference is huge. Oddinary is off the shelf and it is not even 2 year old. Maxident is sporadically stocked, actually it is just recently stocked, which shows the resurgence of Maxident in American charting recently. And yup, other than distribution which is shitty btw, nothing seem to benefit JYPE artists. I feel like JYPE is actually losing out. And should have chose a better American partner tbh. So far all I see is shitty distribution and that is it. No attempt to even get SOME radioplay, no promotion, no proper stocking which is shocking coz how would they even sell if it is not stocked, no festivals (yup they got Lolla but that is Paris one, which I do wonder if it is related to RR or just JYPE getting a good deal/invitation for SKZ in Paris), no collabs (shocking right, SKZ has NO American collabs, at all), no playlisting, nothinnnggg for SKZ. I should have seen it coming when the news of SKZ and RR come about.",

They never even tweeted about Lollapalooza for TXT last year and not for them this year so far -- which is bizarre, because you'd think you'd want to advertise that an artist you have signed is doing those things. In fact, just from searching Republic Records' account, their last tweet about Lollapalooza was in 2021 \ud83d\udc80 I've seen a lot of  Moas complain about how RR does not do much for TXT at all. I can't speak to what they're actually doing other than that they are not responsible for TXT's invites to festivals. \n\nTheir twitter posts for both TXT and Stray Kids are pretty inconsistent too. And there are no tweets about New Jeans (which makes me want to look up if they're even signed because why wouldn't you tweet about them?) \n\nTXT's distribution in terms of physical albums in the USA is pretty good from what I've seen, but they are not the only kpop group that is well distributed in my area so it could just be where I'm from being a place that keeps kpop albums more well-stocked than other places.",

Republic records have very little to do with TXT being invited twice, new jeans once and Stray Kids not being invited. Also, Republic Records tweet way more about skz than txt, so the fact that thats a complaint that stays have about them shows how little they do for both groups. They only tweeted about temptations release a day or two later, they never posted anything for the #1 on billboard (which they did for stray kids) and then they tweeted one other time like 2-3 weeks later. This little conspiracy that republic records are sabotaging skz because they work with TXT and hybe is so ridiculous",

Maxident would probably treated the same way but I think some Stays were RAGING to RR, likely the reason why it is stocked up recently, albeit sporadically still. I compared their albums to TXT old albums which are still available on the shelves while SKZ had Maxident which is rarely stocked up but if you get it, fight for your life for it coz you ain\u2019t seeing it for another generation of children folks.\n\nRR really dropped the ball for SKZ. I feel like they are either actively sabotaging them or just do not care in general. They probably assign one trainee in their company for SKZ and that trainee resigned 2 months ago and the whole company has forgotten to assign a new trainee until SKZ comeback time looms.",

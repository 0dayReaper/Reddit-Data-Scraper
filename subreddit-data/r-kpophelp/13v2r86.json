So basically I was a fan of another group and some people in the comment section of a YouTube video were praising the voices of that group and I was curious so I checked them up and I was shocked. I couldn't believe such talented people existed in K-pop and the fact that they were fucking handsome too (chaotic also XD) ... So yeah lol and I've decided to stan them and to ditch my first one haha. And the fact that I loved their music way way more did it for me and made me a hardcore fan since then.",

I ended up liking all the groups that finished in the top half, and Vanner especially, they are such strong live performers!  It doesn\u2019t hurt that they are also all gorgeous and really funny behind the scenes too, and that they have an amazing part-time idol story!",

But Vanner is older guys too!  Average age is 26 or 27 I think.  Yet another reason why I liked them.  But mostly because they are just so freakin good, and have a wide range of music types they perform well.\n\nI really wish more groups could have finished top 6 \ud83d\ude02.  In addition to the ones that did, I wanted to see team 23, ghost9, and 24k, and really wanted NTX in there too.  I love NTX\u2019s SoundCloud.  It\u2019s under RawHyun and it\u2019s amazing - mostly LoFi but some hip hop too.  Totally mellow relaxing music for me.",

I don\u2019t remember these days exactly but I guess a few minutes after having come across the word \u00ab\u00a0moonsun\u00a0\u00bb I soon transformed into a maniac watching \u00ab moonsun FMVs\u00a0\u00bb on Youtube all day. So I naturally started watching their general content aswell and soon I fell for the whole group. Their music somehow became my safe haven when I was in class, feeling oddly isolated from the rest. I haven\u2019t found another group that makes me laugh as easily and as much as them to this day.",

Then they announced a comeback so I tuned in and was absolutely *floored*. It was a straight up masterpiece from the word go and caused me to do a deep dive of their music and content and before I knew it they had climbed to the top of my stan list. I just loved how big the group was and their expansive history even in such a short time, it gave me a lot to look into which I loved! (I feel like that gives them away lol). \n\nIt wouldn't be until about two comebacks later that I started calling them my ults but I think that first comeback with them is what really sealed the deal for me.",

The one I liked the most I found out was a member of a major group. And she had a new single coming out. So I listened and watched the pre-release song - which was great - and then the comeback single - which was AMAZING. So then I decided to check out the discography of the group she was in and it was instant love. Within a week I was the biggest stan of the group you could imagine, even though it was all pretty new to me. Coincidentally the group had a comeback last summer after a long hiatus and I was floored by the whole experience. I can only imagine that it was far more intense for the OG fans of the group, but honestly \u2026 I don\u2019t know how that could be. \n\nNow I\u2019ve got as many albums as I can get my hands on and I\u2019m settled in most nights watching old videos of theirs and loving it all. To me there\u2019s no other group in KPop history with their songs, charisma, chemistry, and class.",

I loved their dynamics, their hardworking yet fun-loving natures.\n\nI watched Kingdom Legendary War for SKZ in November' 21 and it was there that I discovered ATEEZ. My daughter and I were able to go to their 2 London dates of their \"Beginning of the End\" Tour last year. Seeing them live just blew my mind!!! And it firmly made them joint ults with Stray Kids.",

My cousin insisted that I watch kdrama, korean variety shows, listen to kpop, since he loves those and wants to talk about those things with me but I don't want to heavily invest on those though I've listened and watched kpop and kdrama before but did not become a fan but one day he showed me a dance practice of bts' blood, sweat, and tears I was mesmerized, they danced so well so I followed them and became an army. Bts appeared in iland and I said that I will watch iland because bts will appear in it and I said I will only watch the episode they are in because I don't care about those trainees I don't know them lmao but lo and behold I liked the episode that bts were in got hooked with iland became an engene as well.",

Heard that one boy (who made it to episode 9) will debut in a new group, checked them out, ended up stanning. The boy is a rapper who didn\u2019t really catch my attention during the show, but when i saw his debut.. omg. Idk where that came from. And the rest of the group were perfect in every way. I didn\u2019t think i\u2019ll end up stanning and ult-ing another group out of TB lol (still a huge teume btw!!).",

My friend said she watched an Ateez unboxing and was in love with their new album. So I googled them. I figured I could start by looking into the groups my friend likes. I listened to Answer and I was in, I knew I had to stan them because Queen Answer. They've been my ults even since, it's been 3 years.\n\nLater, I learned my friend is just a casual listener to Ateez and she just likes that one specific concept for the aesthetics lol. I guess it was meant to be.",

Felix\u2026 then Bang Chan\u2026. Hyunjin, etc. Naturally I\u2019d watch a little more each time, so the algorithm did it\u2019s thing and showed me endless SKZ content. Don\u2019t get me wrong, my license plate literally has BTS mixed in the letters and numbers lol but Stray Kids holds a nice little spot in my \ud83e\udd0d. Now what\u2019s so great is that with BTS pausing, I\u2019m able to dive deeper into multiple groups and I\u2019m loving it! It\u2019s extremely overwhelming because the content is endless for each group I come across, but I welcome it with open arms! \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude06",

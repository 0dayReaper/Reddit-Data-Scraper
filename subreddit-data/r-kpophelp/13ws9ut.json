    "postText": "Hello everyone, I\u2019ve been listening to kpop for a few years now but never was interested in buying concert tickets because, frankly, kpop groups never come to my country of residence \ud83d\ude05\nBut, I will be going to Japan soon and might have a chance going to a concert! Thus, I\u2019ve been gathering info on ticketing to plan early, just in case. But I have a few points to clarify so I would very much appreciate help from the experienced fans :)\n\nI mostly follow HYBE groups so I am mostly planning to attend concerts from those groups.\n\n1) From what I gathered there is typically a pre-sale and general sale. With HYBE groups pre-sale requires a Weverse fan club membership of a particular group (TXT pre-sale -&gt; MOA membership, ENHYPEN pre-sale -&gt; ENGENE membership, etc.). I am confused about the SEVENTEEN case though: is there a fan club membership as well?\n\n2) Pre-sale is done in form of lottery. Thus, membership does not guarantee getting a place in pre-sale. If selected, I should receive a code for participation in pre-sale (?)\n\n3) If I don\u2019t have a membership, there is a set deadline for purchasing the membership to enter the pre-sale lottery.\n\n4) During the pre-sale there is a live queue to purchase the tickets. How competitive it is? Some people advise having autofill function for payment card details to purchase better, is that so? For Japanese concerts, do they accept any cards or it\u2019s better to have PayPal/other virtual wallets?\n\n5) There are services that help you buy tickets for Japanese concerts. If there are ID checks at concerts, do they purchase in your name or what?\n\n6) General sale in Japan requires having a Japanese address and a phone number. And the general sale also happens in form of lottery.\n\n7) Some people purchase resale tickets on Twitter: how do they transfer money usually? (I\u2019m not from North America/Europe/East Asia, so I am not much familiar with the money transferring services \ud83d\ude05)\n\nConcert question:\n8) Is there usually a way to preview the venue seating plan? I know that it shows the map once you get into the purchase stage on the platform, but is there any way to preview?\n\n9) Might be a dumb question, but I\u2019ve never been to any type of concert in my life: I saw somewhere that there are usually standing zones near the stage. Do people really stand on their feet for the whole duration of 3 hours?\n\nThis is summary of info that I\u2019ve gathered browsing the Internet and different subreddits. This will be possibly my first time attending a concert, so any help &amp; corrections will be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Prefacing with the fact that I\u2019ve never bought tickets for any Hybe artists, and that there are always new things happening, but I do live in Japan and have bought tickets for over 30 other artists. Don\u2019t have any experience buying without a Jp address/credit card, so I\u2019ll skip those questions.\n\n\n1. Not sure about Hybe, but there is usually a fan club pre-sale, then a few ticket site pre-sales before it goes into general. Seventeen does have a [fanclub](https://www.seventeen-17.jp/pages/join) where it says they offer ticket pre-sales.\n\n\n2. You basically apply for the lottery as if you are buying the ticket. You put in all your payment info, etc, so if you\u2019re successful they take your money and receive an email saying you\u2019re successful, then a few days before the concert you\u2019ll receive your ticket, either electronically or you\u2019ll print it out at a convenience store.\n\n\n3. They usually allow you to join and immediately apply for tickets. It\u2019s how a lot of fanclubs get people to join, but I\u2019m not in any Hybe fanclubs so YMMV.\n\n\n4. Pre-sales are all lotteries so as long as you fill in your details before the deadline, you\u2019re good. For general sales (if 17 get to that - they\u2019re mega popular so they might not go to general), yeah, they sell out in seconds, so it\u2019s best to have all your info saved in the site ahead of time.\n\n\n5. I don\u2019t know about services, just a warning to please be careful! Venues have become incredibly strict with name checks. Sometimes they don\u2019t check at all, but I remember them not letting people in to BTS cons because they didn\u2019t look enough like their ID photos!\n\n\n6. As far as I know, everything requires a Jp address (I could be wrong though!) General sales are FCFS, not lottery.\n\n\n8. Depends on the venue. If you search the concert venue name plus \u5ea7\u5e2d\u8868 you can usually see seating charts. Seventeen play at Domes, though, where they can change up seating, especially depending on what kind of stage they have. Some companies also have random blocks so that people don\u2019t try to resell seats.\n\n\n9. There generally aren\u2019t standing zones in Japan unless the groups are playing at a small club. The one exception I can think of recently is Ateez, though, so it could happen. There are always seated sections, though, if you\u2019re worried about standing for that time. But yeah, people do stand for that long!\n\n\nHope that helps!",

I'm also not an Aroha, and I've only seen a couple of their songs and clips in compilations, but Moon Bin was exceptionally well-known and well-liked; I would've never guessed that he was struggling so hard on the inside. We're basically the same age too (fellow '98 liner) and I'm fighting my own mental health issues right now, so it feels especially cruel. \n\nI also feel awful for everyone who in losing him have lost a rock/pillar of strength/role model/happy place/sanctuary/escape. I hope Aroha, his members and his family can give each other the strength to get through this.",

The way it happened, the pain he must have been in to even get to this point, his age, how his family is affected. How the people we do love and care about who knew him directly will be affected too (whether some people like it or not, idols from different groups are relatively close and have relationships we know nothing about with each other), but also, the reality that they may be facing the same hardships and possibly selfishly, that we might also find ourselves here with our own faves cos people seem fine and next thing this happens. Additionally, sympathising with their fans too, and so on and so forth. \n\nIt's always painful when a person passes, a young person at that who was at the prime of his life and career, and under these circumstances. It would be weirder if you felt absolutely nothing about this tbh. Your feelings are valid. Take care of yourself. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",

A human life has been lost.\n\n And when you start imagining there are friends and family of his who will never see him again and talk to him again. There are fans or people in the same industry whose lifes he could have been a role model to and impacted what they decided to do hugely somewhere in the past....  It feels unreal, impossible, heavy, unthinkable. When you think of the members or other idols he was a friend of or interacted with.....  It's a tremendous loss to all those mentioned. When you think that just two days ago he was spending his time somewhere somehow and he existed. Suddenly no. \n\nI felt the same when my sister came and told me the news, I couldn't believe it and had tears in my eyes immediately, without even being an active fan of theirs. It doesn't make it any less a tragedy. I still feel like crying when I think about it and still can't believe it's real.",

Before Moonbin's passing, I'd only seen a couple tiktoks with him in it and I watched him in the kdrama, Moment at Eighteen, a couple weeks ago. But when I saw the news yesterday, it hurt, and then I saw a video of him talking to his sister, Moon Sua, and she told him that when she's struggling, she only feels like there's someone on her side when she talks to him, and I cried because I can't imagine what she's feeling right now, my own sister is the same age as Moonbin and I can't imagine losing her so soon, of her no longer being a phone call away.\n\nSo yeah, it's okay to mourn the loss of a life of someone you didn't really know.",

Always so out of the blue, you know? And I think for me the reason this is so hard is because it forces me to realize that this could happen to ANYONE - be it someone I only know as a fan or someone in my daily life. It is so insidious. So it\u2019s scary. And then on top of that I have a close friend who loved Moonbin above all of her other favorites - and it\u2019s because of her that I even know about Kpop. There are no words that will take away her pain. And then on top of that SHINee are my favorites and this situation is bringing up feelings that I struggle with anyhow and amplifying them, etc. \n\nSo thank you for opening up this thread.

I mean, I still have gotten over Jonghyun's death, so I can only imagine how the families and their friends must feel. I'm not into astro, but every time I saw moonbin show up on my feed, he would make me laugh. He seemed like such a nice person and even his last tweet was just so sweet. It broke my heart when i read it. I really hope his family is ok and that he gets to rest in peace. Nobody deserves to go through something like this.",

            "comment": "Many people appreciating choreography are also not dancers btw. But visual aspects are important, and people can always appreciate when moves are executed cleanly/fluidly or there is good synchronisation. Or just how the choreography itself looks. Honestly speaking I've got nothing aside from 1 year in hiphop dance at 8 years old lol.\n\nDepending on the group, I don't always care about *choreography* (aside from a few groups I stan that are choreo-focused)... but I do care about overall *performance*, as someone who's watched plenty of concert clips and performances from my faves. You can be dripping with charisma and put on a mindblowing (vocal) performance without having any choreography focus at all.\n\nOfc, to me music is the most important, as it is the one thing I will consume on a daily basis. I'm not watching performances when I'm working, or exercising, or walking around- I have my earbuds in listening to music, so that matters the most.",

But I\u2019ve come to see liking Kpop as going to a buffet. You\u2019re presented with a lot of things, but you don\u2019t need to care about everything. You can just pick and choose what resonates with you. There are things I like that I\u2019ve seen some fans ignore, so it goes both ways.",

Over my lifetime I've expended so much time and energy typing paragraphs discussing how visuals, talents, choreography, variety, charisma, etc., simultaneously all matter in Kpop but hold different weight to different fans, and every preference holds validity... yet it is so concisely expressed right here lol.

Some of the best concerts I've ever been to were to see Epik High and N.Flying and neither of them even have choreo but they sure as hell know how to captivate an audience.",

            "comment": "I don't think I'd have ever gotten into kpop in the first place without the performance aspect. It's funny because the choreographies were pretty basic in 2nd gen compared to today, but it was still miles ahead from whatever American or British pop singers were doing. The fact that kpop having groups made me nostalgic might have still won me over, but I think it was that combined with the performances that caught me all those years ago. I never really managed to get into jpop idols, because the performance aspect isn't there for me (jpop idols have their own charm for sure, just doesn't really do it for me).\n\nFor me kpop isn't just music, it's music + performance + visuals (music videos, styling, beauty) + all the variety stuff. I think they're all equally important for me.\n\nETA: I said \"for me\" four times lol but yeah just to be really clear, I am just talking about how I feel about it, it's fine if you don't care for the performance side",

            "comment": "My guess would be that often people find kpop attractive because it has that physical/visual aspect to it, and if you're the kind to want to dance when you hear music there being set choreographies that you can do (or at least, point choreos) helps if you don't/ don't know how to dance already. Not everyone is going to feel this way of course, many people don't really care at all, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's fairly common. You shouldn't feel like the odd one out, or that you're not a serious enough fan or something, you're totally fine and there are plenty of people out there who relate to your feelings.\n\n\n&gt; i feel like i see so many people in this community talking about choreo and stage presence and all that, is it really that important? for me im not a dancer so i dont have a clue what they are talking about.\n\nNo not really. \"Stage presence\" is entirely subjective, and when it comes to discussions of choreography it's not uncommon the people talking about them aren't dancers either. Most fans as far as I've seen don't know any choreographies, haven't taken any dance classes, haven't done extensive research on dance, etcetera; don't put too much stock into those types of discussions, I know of *maybe* three or four YT accounts that talk about kpop dance in detail who really know their stuff.",

            "comment": "I mean same as you, \"if the performance looks nice it just looks nice\". But despite being far from an expert, I will still have opinions. If a performance *doesn't* look nice then I'll generally think it's because I don't like the choreo or don't vibe with the members' stage presence. And I have opinions on \"good\" and \"bad\" choreo and stage presence, that are however based on purely personal opinion and not any kind of dance or stage expertise.\n\nHaving the music as your priority and just kinda appreciating performances when you happen to see them is not that unpopular imo. It's just that in a discussions-focused space you'll see less of that because like, \"oh yeah it's nice\" or \"idk it's not that nice to me\" generally won't generate long discussions haha",

They both go in depth on ranking dancers of groups (it's helped me understand the fundamentals of kpop dance... )\n\nAccording to them Momo and Lisa are some of the idols at the top of their game (obviously lol) but it really helped me learn the small nuisances of choreography and I appreciate it so much more after watching",

            "comment": "The visual aspect is actually what first got me interested in K-Pop (before I was more of a goth/metal connoisseur \ud83d\ude00) because I absolutely love the androgynous styling, the dancing, the looks overall (I do love looking at beautiful things and the first thing I ever saw was Felix doing the maniac choreo, I mean, come on) but I ultimately stayed for the music. I am a huge fan of watching dance practice videos and performances, I was absolutely gobsmacked by Hyunjin's Play with Fire video, but the music is still what makes me stick with a group. So I guess, even though I'm such a visual person the music is still the most important thing. I have a Mamamoo playlist even though they're not huge on choreo (or I simply haven't seen it), but there's no group I follow just for the dancing aspect. But it is definitely something that I love about K-Pop and I am super happy that both Stray Kids and ATEEZ keep me well fed with insane choreos and performances \u2764\ufe0f (would still love to see Mamamoo live even if they just stand there and sing \ud83d\ude00)",

    "postText": "I remember the group got attention for wearing really short shorts with knee pads. I think they wore all black as well with those shorts and knee pads. I think one of the moves in the choreography had them kneeling down and then doing some type of body roll with one arm like covering their face a bit. I have no idea when they debuted or when the song was released, I just remember seeing them on one of those iconic kpop things a few years ago for their short shorts.\n\nI suddenly remembered this in my brain and I can't figure out what kpop boy group or song they were doing and its been bothering me lol Hope someone could help out!  \n\n\n!solved",

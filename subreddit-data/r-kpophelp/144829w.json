And I LOVE IT! Some songs I\u2019m currently enjoying are: \n\nILY:1 - Que Sera Sera, Love in Bloom, Twinkle Twinkle\n\nOH MY GIRL - Nonstop, Fifth Season, Dun Dun Dance\n\nBrave Girls - Chi Mat Ba Ram, Rollin\u2019\n\nIZ*ONE - AYAYAYA, La Vie en Rose\n\nfromis_9 - Airplane Mode\n\nCherry Bullet - Really Really\n\nWJSN - As You Wish\n\nI\u2019m building my summer playlist and would welcome any song recs that go into the same direction. Doesn\u2019t have to be just gg or just nugu. Like I\u2019m also getting into Twice and need help there\u2026",

Just pretty much watch all their MVs thats all you need to do to get into them. \n\nFromis_9 has many summer songs like DM, We Go, Stay this way, Love Bomb. \n\nAlso SISTAR were notoriously know as summer queens for consistently having comebacks only during the summers when they were active. I will recommend Touch My Body, Shake it, I like that, Ma Boy, Say! Yes",

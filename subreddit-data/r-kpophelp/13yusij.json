    "postText": "Is it 77 times? Or 78? \n\nI say 78 because of \ub450 (the only \ub450 in hangul) at the start of the 8th stanza. I think it should count because there's no way they wrote the lyric and didn't say something like, \"Ah yes, another way to use du! Good word play.\"\n\nMy friend says that \ub450 shouldn't count because du means 2 in that context and isn't \"one of the du du dus.\"\n\nPlease help us settle this inconsequential debate? Thanks! \ud83d\ude4f",

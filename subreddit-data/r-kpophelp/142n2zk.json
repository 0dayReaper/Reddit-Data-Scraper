Blaze intro is a bit more calmer but then picks up pace later, the song [is about](https://youtu.be/6IjMd3Vg4DU) wanting to burn up/shine brightly &amp; go out with a bang, rather than glowing softly your whole life, even if it kills you. Loser is self-explanatory.",

            "comment": "wouldn't it make more sense for the song to be something the character would be listening to naturally? Two ways I can think about it\n\n1. the character is motivated to listen to something because they feel motivated to go and draw in a park under a tree, so the song should express that vibe\n2. the character is just listening to music/playlist they like and they happen to be under a tree at the time drawing. In that case there doesn't need to be a connection between the song and the character's action\n\nIn either case it's the writer who would know best what song to play or at least have that information to give to you. And if there's no input in that regard, if case (1) then pick a nature-y spring song. If case (2) then either look to the character's history or, barring none, pic your fave or recent comeback that maybe they're checking out/streaming if they're into that\n\n*edit:adding on*\n\n3. maybe the character is in a mood and wants to peacefully be under a tree drawing but because of said mood can't, and thus the ripping and tearing. play music that the character would listen to because...\n\n3a) it reflects that frustrated mood, or\n\n3b) they want to calm down by doing this activity so they listen to something calm or something that they would listen in this case not because the song is calm but because they have history with this song that calms them down (maybe its a fave from childhood and it's nostalgic, something that reminds them of family, etc). This can certainly give contrast to the scene, music v. action.\n\n4. Screw it, just play Jopping. You know you want to. Do it! JOPPING!!\n\n5. filler\n\n6. You know what 6 different letters? Jopping.\n\n7. You know what has 7 letters?....\n\n...\n\n..\n\nJOPPING!!!\n\n*(stopping now. good luck with the scene)*",

                    "comment": "so here's the thing: one, the entire assignment focuses on editing more than what's happening. two the sequence focuses more on the situation rather than the character.\n\nand they are in a park listening to the music they like it just happens that they cant get the drawing right so they're frustrated so the song has nothing to do with that cause as you said the character is supposedly listening to it to have a good time which is not happening lol. but the other scenario where the song reflects the mood is also a good one to think about. i have many songs on my playlist to choose from but i just dont know which one to use thats why i asked for recs. thank you for your advice tho it really helped.",

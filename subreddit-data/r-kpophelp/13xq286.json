    "postText": "For some context, Astro have been my one of my ults since 2018 and Moonbin has not only been my bias in Astro but he\u2019s been my ult male bias for a few years. So obviously I was distraught when I heard the news of his death. There were weeks where I couldn\u2019t go a day without crying. It along with other thing happening in my life spiraled me into a depression that I still haven\u2019t quite gotten out of.\n\nHowever I couldn\u2019t help but feel bad about being this upset over somebody that I don\u2019t know personally. I kept thinking about all the people who I felt were allowed to be effected (the Astro members, his close friends idols or otherwise, Sua and the rest of his family). I felt like they were the ones who deserve to be upset and I felt extremely guilty for feeling upset myself.\n\nI was starting to get over this guilt until I told my therapist about what happened and she just didn\u2019t understand. She actually said \u201cwhy are you so upset about this\u201d and that sent me back to the doubts and guilt I was feeling previously.\n\nSo now I\u2019m in a state where I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s okay for me to be upset about him, especially as upset as I am.",

            "comment": "Agree with comments to get a new therapist unless she was trying to uncover if the event triggered other issues.  The entire kpop stan community mourned Moonbin and no one gets to tell you how fast or slow you are supposed to heal from it.  \n\nThe thing is even if we didn\u2019t stan him, was someone we had known about for his good reputation as a performer and person.  The world is hard, we look to kpop for fun and healing, and to know someone beloved by most of our faves was having such a hard time hurts and also losing a positive force hurts. \n\nSometimes I cry when a friend or family member of a friend or even online mutual passes even if I didn\u2019t know them because I could tell they had been a good person. \n\nTL;DR crying over Moonbin means you\u2019re human and not some scabbed over unfeeling machine",

It seems like maybe they were trying to help you understand why you are feeling this way like some people above said. And it's okay even if you don't know. The grief you are feeling is completely normal and I hope will feel better, but it's not a race. I was a somewhat casual follower of astro and even I cried and still think about him and even those that passed years back like sulli, it's a sad event. Anyway, I just wanted to reassure you, don't feel guilty for feeling sad, a good soul was lost, and its okay to be grieving for him.",

            "comment": "Whoo goodness, be ready for my wall of text here...\n\nTW: Mentions of suicide, SHINee's Jonghyun, etc\n\nSo, I'm a Shawol--have been for a long time. I was even living in South Korea when Jonghyun passed away. It was sudden, tragic, and shattered my world. I immediately went into a panic attack--sobbing, shaking, inconsolable. I was alone in my tiny apartment in a country where I DID have friends who also loved Kpop, but we were all now devastated--and as my friends in other countries began to wake up, we became the ones who NEEDED to be there for them.\n\nDeath, for me, has never been a huge thing. While I am sad when family members passed away, I was more sad that my mother was sad (my grandparents passed a few years apart) and I lost a childhood friend when I was very young, which again, I was sad about, but I had never felt this amount of pain before. (except for when my pets pass away)\n\nI felt stupid and ridiculous almost immediately, especially when I went to teach the next day and a few of my meaner kids knew I loved SHINee and they made fun of me for it. I tried hard not to cry, but I did between classes. I called my mom that day and she comforted me, but also didn't fully understand...\n\nWeeks passed, months passed...his birthday rolled around and I was hurt all over again. I felt that pain again. I had felt the pain for weeks after his passing due to the funeral, people mocking it, people mourning it, people showing pictures of it--it was everywhere. I worked on myself with my friends and would feel better slowly, but then something would remind me of him and I'd immediately fall back into pieces.\n\nIt's been years since then. It still hurts. I cry the day he left us, I cry on the day of his birth. I cry over some of his old songs that he poured his own pain into. I see signs of what was to come now in videos leading up to the incident. I am happy to see his memory is not lost, I am happy to see the four boys still loving him and cherishing his memory. Hell, I even worked with his sister and the Shiny Foundation while living in Korea, helping them sell to overseas fans.\n\nIt still hurts. I'm still mourning. My best friend wrote an article about mourning for her blog for her work, and she said something like this:\n\nSociety expects us to embrace \"Time will heal\" and also \"you have a set amount of time to heal, then you need to get over it\". Time does heal, but healing doesn't mean it goes away. Wounds leave scars, as well as permanent damage sometimes. And everyone mourns differently. Some can be okay in a matter of days or weeks, so may never 'get over it'.\n\nWe're trying to 'live up to' the standards of society, we've given ourselves a timer to 'get over' these musicians and idols that we don't know personally...but these idols, these men and women who we listen to daily, see daily, adore, get to know through their music, videos, tweets, lyrics--they're more than just people to us. They're our comfort, our homes, our solace and that *one song* can pull us out of deep, dark sadness and it feels like they're embracing us and telling us it'll be okay. They're people to look up to, to be role models and help show us how to work harder, while also being good people, and that even our own dreams can come true.\n\nSo when we realize that they're in pain like us, their mental health is broken like ours, their lives aren't as perfect as we thought...it's scary. Because while we don't know them personally, they mean a lot to us in many ways, so we want to help them...and make it better, sometimes more than ourselves.\n\nSo no, don't feel guilty. Don't think that you have to 'get over it' or 'move on'. Don't stop mourning, and you can be upset. Love him, cherish his memory, do what you can and want to do to help yourself feel better. Cry, scream, listen to his music, avoid his pictures, or even watch him on YT or something--talk to others about it, other fans or non-fans. Gush about him, tell others how sad you are, show people who didn't bias him how much he was worth to the world so that we can all learn to try to take care of ourselves and others better.\n\nHe touched your life and made it better. Fuck your therapist and fuck anyone who says it's stupid or silly. Sounds like you need a new therapist.\n\nBe gentle with yourself. Society isn't always right when it comes to these types of things.",

There are many different types of grief and I am highly empathetic and often project my feelings too much, but its totally normal to grieve the loss of a life no matter if you knew them personally or not.)\n\nIf your therapist said that I advise you to contact them for a new appointment and during that one maybe ask them what they meant by that, give them a chance to clarify the meaning of what they said and if they do the same thing as before then maybe tell them you will be looking for a new therapist as soon as possible. \n\nIts unprofesional af, and unacceptable for them to dismiss your feelings like that, it doesn't matter if its an idol or celebrity, that's a messed up thing for a therapist to do and frankly they shouldn't be providing therapy for anyone with that attitude imo.\n\nTherapist can offer you advice and ways to deal with what you are going through, but they should never be pushy or judgmental and should not make you doubt yourself in any way.\n\nSending you good vibes and &lt;3",

The grief attached to these kinds of losses is not always viewed by others (including some Mental Health Professionals) as valid, but it is as real and as painful as any other grief a person experiences, and that's important to remember--remind yourself of that as often as you need to. \n\nThe most important thing, though, is for you to take care of yourself and make sure you stay mentally well. Make sure that the grief and the loss that you're experiencing don't swallow you whole. Take care of yourself, acknowledge the loss you've experienced, and find things in your life that help you move through your grief rather than remain stagnant in it (experiencing grief is never the issue, getting stuck in it is). Try to process Moonbin\u2019s loss and find any meaning that you can in it. And, whatever you do, please never forget that what you're feeling is valid, and you will (eventually) be ok.

Even knowing nothing about him until his death I have a lot of empathy for him, his fans, his family &amp; his friends that his death still saddens me. \n\nI can't imagine how emotionally destroyed I would be if anyone from my Ult group died. I know they don't know I exist &amp; I'm fine with that, but they're so special to me. Their music &amp; content has helped me through hard times. They've inspired me creatively, and things they've said have comforted me even when they obviously weren't directed at me. They have been a consistent joy in my life for 5 years, they are a part of my life now. They are very important to me, and I would be torn apart if any of them died. Heck, with the state of the world is in, I'm nervous about them going to military right now.

You may need to ask them to treat it a certain way in order for them to know how to help you, if they don\u2019t understand the feelings being over a celeb you like. You can try explaining he felt like a friend to you, and ask them to help you heal/cope/etc by treating the situation as if you lost a friend (rather than as him being a celeb you didn\u2019t know personally).",

            "comment": "Honestly this comes down to the idol industry and how they work. Idols are presenting themselves to us as if we're in a relationship with them especially the younger they are as a group. They're encouraged to form parasocial relationships with their fans. Idols aren't just normal celebrities that we might see via paparazzi photos, random interviews and on the big screen/performances. We see their daily lives, they vlog for us, we have so much extra time to get to know them and even though realistically we know they're far beyond our reach and aren't truly someone we know. That doesn't mean we don't feel like that. They've been around for us for years. They've influenced us in ways other people may not be able to comprehend. We might have never personally talked to them but we've shared their joy, their laughter, their struggles. We've grown with them. It's only natural you'd be effected. In fact it would be almost strange if you weren't. For people that don't understand how fandoms work and understand this type of relationship, it can be baffling. But we 100% understand you and that therapist should reflect a lot. They're supposed to help you work through your feelings, even if it wasn't like this. You're still upset, they're your feelings. They don't just go away because someone else doesn't understand them. You're allowed to be sad and grieve for his loss. I hope the days can be a little bit brighter for you in the future but for now lean on the people that understand you and your community so you can be supported.",

Or I would always remember just when life felt shittiest. just because you didn't know Moonbin doesn't mean he didn't play a significant part in your life. To have liked him since 2018 is a long time. You have years worth of memories that you can tie to his image now. When you spend so long adoring someone or something you associate it with feelings, seasons, foods, smells, locations. Jonghyun was a huge part of my adolescence and my early twenties. For me he's become cherry limeade, long drives in the mountains, karaoke, the Oregon coast, red sweatshirts and air that's so cold it hurts when you inhale. It was like losing my final ties to childhood. I liked SHINee since I was 16 and their music played a pivotal role helping me get through my parents divorce and moving across the state, losing all my friends. I wonder even if I would be as close to my mom today if I hadn't become their fan. \n\nWas it healthy? Probably not. But I'm not going to feel bad for it. Had to find myself in the aftermath.  My first painting ten years after quitting art was Jonghyun in 2018 and I think to this day it's the one I'm most proud of. \n\nI would say your therapist just doesn't get it. And making you question your morality on the matter isn't helping. It probably confuses her if she's never been a huge fan of anyone. Mourning a celebrities death isn't even a new thing. Even Taemin himself was seen wearing an mj t shirt a lot following Michael Jackson's death. People do it every day. I don't think you need to or even should feel guilty.",

So I can't even imagine what it's like for people like you. I'm so sorry. \n\nI'll share a comment I posted on someone else's post who also felt sad but they weren't following the group either...\n\n\"... if we're able to cry over fictional characters dying in movies or shows, it comes to reason that of course when it comes to real life people, we'll be affected too.\n\nThis is painfully tragic and the circumstances make it even so. The way it happened, the pain he must have been in to even get to this point, his age, how his family is affected. How the people we do love and care about who knew him directly will be affected too (whether some people like it or not, idols from different groups are relatively close and have relationships we know nothing about with each other), but also, the reality that they may be facing the same hardships and possibly selfishly, that we might also find ourselves here with our own faves cos people seem fine and next thing this happens. Additionally, sympathising with their fans too, and so on and so forth.\n\nIt's always painful when a person passes, a young person at that who was at the prime of his life and career, and under these circumstances. It would be weirder if you felt absolutely nothing about this tbh. Your feelings are valid. Take care of yourself. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c \"\n\n&gt; I kept thinking about all the people who I felt were allowed to be effected (the Astro members, his close friends idols or otherwise, Sua and the rest of his family). I felt like they were the ones who deserve to be upset and I felt extremely guilty for feeling upset myself.\n\nAbout this: just like love, grief is not a finite resource that only a few are allowed. He had tons of people who love him and so there'll be tons of people who feel sad too. You're not less deserving of grieving just because of distance. I'm really sorry you're going through this and that you're feeling conflicted about it too. That's not fair, feel free to process this how you want. And be easy with yourself and give yourself some grace. Sending you some hugs. \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c",

And it was the first time I really cried over the passing of a celebrity. Hearing his songs, seeing his pictures, etc all made me feel that same sadness all over again. Your feelings are 100% valid. Feel your feelings. It\u2019s ok. I hope the stories other people have shared in this thread of their own grief over Moonbin or another artist\u2019s passing helps you see you aren\u2019t alone. For so many people (and I\u2019m assuming including you) music is such an integral part of our lives and losing the very special and talented people who create that music is such a sad event.

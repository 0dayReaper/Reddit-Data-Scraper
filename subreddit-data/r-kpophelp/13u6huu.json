She's got an AI multiverse concept- her earlier releases are straight up cyberpunk, but the multiverse stuff lets her try out a lot of different sounds and styles while still having an overarching theme. She's also just an incredible dancer and performer. Even if her songs aren't entirely to your taste, watching her stages is always worth it",

My favourites are:\n\n* [Hypnotize](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XGigcMweiaE&amp;pp=ygUOYW5kYSBoeXBub3RpemU%3D) (I seriously love this song, it's such a europop banger)\n* [Mastering](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dddOva5Blyg&amp;pp=ygUJQW5kYSBrcG9w) (kinda opposite vibes to Hypnotize, very understated and groovy but again I love this song)\n* [Touch](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lUyRuyB01Vo&amp;pp=ygUJQW5kYSBrcG9w) (a pretty risqu\u00e9 MV as far as kpop goes so just a warning, this one's just really fun and catchy pop song)\n\n+ her biggest song was [What You Waiting For](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u1xr0L1heHI&amp;pp=ygUJQW5kYSBrcG9w) when she got signed to The Black Label and it looked like she was getting somewhere, but unfortunately it never amounted to anything more. I'm not so into this one, it's like a club track",

He used to be part of YG and has been in a bunch of kdramas, but he released this one album \"PRVT 01\" in 2019 and nothing since. It's got this super laid back hiphop/pop/R&amp;B vibe that's hard to describe. I love playing it while driving at night after a long day",

Singer-songwriter vibes for the most part, although she's dabbled in more rock oriented stuff as well. Recommendations: Oort Cloud, all of Supersonic, Not There, Just Listen, Delete, Fly, Winter Flower. \n\nUZA is pretty indie synthpop. Some of my favorites are Finder, Neutralize, and S.O.S",

If any musicians are reading this, you HAVE TO check her out. \n\nShe's a singer-songwriter/composer, and an amazing pianist (jazz, gospel). \n\n[This short performance](https://youtu.be/tu5da7y5z9Y) of her incredible unreleased song Magnetic Force really shows off the caliber of musician she is. (there's also a full version official live clip with a band on her channel)\n\nAnother amazing unreleased song is [\uadf8\ub9bc (Yearning)](https://youtu.be/VvJhSsMYpP4).\n\nFor her released songs, she has been working with the one and only Jewhi!\n\n(If you don't know Jehwi, he's most known for working with IU, having composed songs such as Through the Night, dlwlrma, unlucky, My sea)\n\nHer first two official releases, her original song [Have You Ever](https://youtu.be/KfqZ3IEf0l4), and her cover of [White Christmas](https://youtu.be/3mndpliNO2M), were both co-arranged with Jewhi. \n\nHer newest song, [only u](https://youtu.be/7jQHmM6plLY), features Sam Kim!\n(Jewhi's involvement was only with recording and mixing/mastering with this one)\n\nShe also has some great covers on her YouTube channel.",

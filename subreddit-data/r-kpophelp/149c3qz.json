    "postText": "I probably just need a short few weeks break. I want to stop getting kpop recommendations on my youtube and reddit pages, but the only way I know how is blocking channels, and asking reddit to stop showing posts from those communities. However those methods could be permanent when I only want a short couple weeks break. I probably won't stop listening to the music, however my main focus is not watching any kpop content. \n\nIs there any way that I could just temporarily block the channels, so that when I want to come back, it can start recommending those channels like usual?\n\n(I didn't know what flair to use.)",

            "comment": "A new youtube account is an easy solution. But you can also click 'don't recommend this channel' and when you want to undo all of this, go to your google account settings and go to the Data &amp; Privacy tab &gt; \"Youtube watch &amp; history settings\" (under History Settings). Then from the 'Controls' tab go to 'Other Activities' and click Delete to delete all the things you told youtube not to recommend/show to you, basically resetting this option.\n\nNo need for blocking, you only need to click \"not interested\" and then choose \"don't recommend channel\", choosing \"i don't like this video\" won't work. It will take a while if you have lots of kpop related content but once you do it, it truly doesn't recommend those channels ever again.\n\nEdit: and you only need to do it once per a channel. You can immediately see the results when you refresh the page.",

I already have another account for non-kpop interests and just random stuff. There's been too many times when I went to search for a video on say, how to fix my coffee machine, and then an hour later I'm watching recommended Kpop videos and my coffee machine is still broken...",

I will get excited for new comebacks and releases, and listen to the music, but i can't be bothered with all the day-to-day trivial happenings and fan-drama.   \n\n\nas other users have said, stop reacting to the kpop-related recommendations, and click on other topics you enjoy. the algorithm will filter it out for you over time, without having to permanently remove things.",

YouTube also has tabs at the top of the recommended page now that filters it when you choose one. But if you don't want to even see kpop related videos having a second account to follow other content you like is much easier than blocking and unblocking things, then you can choose \"don't recommend\" without worrying",

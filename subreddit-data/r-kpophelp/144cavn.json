    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm headed to South Korea for the first time next week, and I saw on a schedule for the KSPO dome that Itzy (one of my favorites) will be playing at the Lotte Duty Free Family Concert on June 17.\n\nCan anyone tell me the best way to get tickets for it? I'm from Canada, and looks like I can buy some on stubhub but the price is a little high. Should I just wait and go there the night of the show? \n\nIs there a site where I can buy tickets to the show that's not too confusing (I only speak/read english)? Any tips would be appreciated, feel free to message me direct if you want.",

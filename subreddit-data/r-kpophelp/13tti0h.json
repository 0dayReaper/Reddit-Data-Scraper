    "postText": "Hi guys, I\u2019ll be attending my first ever KPOP concert and it\u2019s Black Pink! \n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have very good seats and I\u2019m on the last row all the way at the back \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAny recommendation on what binoculars I should get so that I can see the girls faces????? Side note, if there\u2019s a pair that I can also use for basic bird watching that would be a great too. \n\nMy budget is between $50-$250. \n\nThanks! Any advice is appreciated :)",

I have a cheap pair that\u2019s small and compact since I was holding them the entire concert. They were also not my first choice, but the ones I looked at previously were heavy and or not as clear.

It\u2019s quite hard to take great pictures through binoculars + it will bring down the quality. \n\nBut since you might also use it to watch birds and therefore rather invest in an actual pair; they sell plenty second hand, in charity shops, thrift shops, etc.  At least where I\u2019m from, I always see plenty.",

I like a clear bag to go through security quickly and to protect against spills etc\n\nIf you have dressed up also bring some safety pins and make up remover wipes in case your mascara smears\n\nSnack lines will be long so if I am there early I will bring a kind bar or something",

            "comment": "What you can bring and which bag you can use depends on the venue so you should look at the FAQ on the website of the arena/hall you're going to. It'll say what sort of bag, dimensions, and which items you can't bring.\n\nWhen you have to turn up depends on whether you have seats or if you're standing. If you have seats you can turn up whenever as long as it's before the concert starts. I would do an hour before in case of traffic to be safe but you could do later. If you're standing however, people will be queueing for hours to try to get spots near the stage. If you care about being right at the front then you need to get there several hours early, if you're not as bothered then just an hour or two early is probably OK. \n\nAlso, whether you're standing or sitting, if you want to buy merchandise then it's often worth turning up early as it could run out. For that it kinda depends on the artist on whether they prepare a lot of merch or not, so for Ateez if they've done other stops on the tour just check if the merch sold out early at the other stops (if you want to buy something, otherwise it doesn't matter).",

I don't know how it works everywhere but to concerts I've been to, the queue was just join as you get there, and the standing spots in the venue was also an open choice, though the very front was sectioned off for those with more expensive tickets. But other than that you could stand wherever",

Apart from what was already mentioned, I also brought cough drops and they were an absolute LIFESAVER! Me and everyone around me had a sore throat after the first 10 minutes of singing/screaming, and I made so many people happy with the cough drops, they helped immensely! Apart from that, tissues, ear plugs, powerbank (if allowed), cash, painkillers, hair tie, and a small mirror \ud83d\ude42 what kind of bag/back pack you need depends on the venue, I had a clear one even though I didn't need it and it was super nice because the security guys took one look at it and let me pass (so they didn't find all the granola bars hehehe)",

If you\u2019re sensitive to noise I would bring noise cancelling earbuds or ear plugs. I really don\u2019t see any need to arrive 7 hours early unless you want to buy limited merch like a lightstick or something.",

    "postText": "I'm someone who only got to know K-pop last year and I still have some doubts about this world. One piece of knowledge I have regarding the development of K-pop is that the first market outside of Korea where K-pop expanded was Japan, with Boa and TVXQ, both of SM. Then SM also began an expansion process to China and then to the Sea. But the impression I have, and I'm making this post to make sure about it, is that although it arrived in Japan first, SM artists are historically more popular in China, and that SM itself has put a lot more effort into becoming establish in the Chinese market than in the Japanese one. For example: SM's first foreign idol was a Chinese, they created the sub unit for Super Junior which was SJ M, being focused on China, Exo was divided into two units, one for Korea and one for China , and the first NCT unit outside of Korea was WayV which is focused on China.\r  \n\r  \nWe had SM groups that are popular in Japan, currently NCT \u200b\u200band Aespa are quite popular there, but at least the impression I get is that HYBE, JYP and even YG groups are more popular in Japan today than than those of SM.\r  \n\r  \nSo on this topic I ask the following questions:\r  \n\r  \n1- Are SM groups really more popular in China than in Japan?\r  \n\r  \n2- Was there any specific reason that led SM to be interested in the Chinese market, but even in the Japanese market, to the point of debuting Chinese artists before Japanese debuts and setting up their groups/sub units first in China?\r  \n\r  \n3 - Am I correct in saying that groups from other companies (HYBE, JYP, YG) are more popular in Japan than SM's right now? If so, can you think of a reason for that?\r  \n\r  \n4- In your opinion, did SM's strong focus on the Chinese market end up being a problem for the company in the long term, since relations between Korea and China are not the best currently?",

SHINee is arguably the most popular korean bg in Japan, especially since pretty much all the members are fluent in japanese and able to promote on Japanese variety shows. YG tried to do the same with Bigbang and while they definitely saw success, only Daesung really got huge in Japan (to a point where you could buy food shaped like his nose, I'm not even kidding).",

China had a nearly untapped, gigantic market that would represent a gigantic opportunity for (what was at the time) minimal risk and investment.  It's not like the US market where there are literal cartels chokeholding everything about the music business (radio play, charting, awards, album printing, distributing, concerts, etc.) or the Japanese market which had turned into a red ocean with every kpop group trying their luck there.\n\nThen the Korean Culture Freeze happened, and all the good investments/business directions that SM copmmitted to China turned into expensive, long-term opportunity cost.  Korean public sentiment became *very* anti-China, and SM develops a reputation for being  \"pro-CCP\".  Worse, the public sentiment on China become even more hostile (something like 70-80% of Koreans now think of China negatively compared to 20-30% before the Cultural Freeze).\n\nNot a surprise LSM is rumored to have moved his business interest to China after he lost SM.",

            "comment": "I would say yes. SM tends to promote more in China (SuperJunior-M, EXO-M, WayV, etc). They do have some Japanese songs, but no Japanese units (soon to change though with the Japanese NCT unit). \n\nMy guess is just from a marketing perspective, they just saw China has a huge market that wasn't really tapped into by other companies. Even in earlier gens (ie the time of SuperJunior-M) there were groups promoting a lot in Japan, but not as many in China.\n\nI would say the most popular companies in Japan right now are Hybe and JYP. JYP groups are popular because they do a ton of Japanese promotions. You have NiziU + Twice has a ton of Japanese releases. Hybe is popular because of the popularity of their groups + the sheer amount of advertising there. (This isn't to say the others aren't popular though either.)\n\nI don't think SM focusing on China was a bad decision at all. I'm not as familiar with SuperJunior-M, but EXO-M was highly successful while they were active, and WayV is successful as well. That being said though, they still aren't as popular as cpop boy groups, but idk if that would have even been the case in Japan.",

Treasure is probably their most popular group right now in Japan.\n\nIn South East Asia I would say YG and SM are the most popular. Both had popularity there since 2nd gen, and it's carried over until now. YG is probably the biggest overall in SEA.\n\nAs for China, JYP groups aren't that popular. They actually have a Chinese boy group called Boy Story, but they haven't made it big yet. Twice also isn't popular due to a scandal with Tzuyu where they were actually blacklisted in China. Stray Kids is their most popular group there right now. Hybe groups are much more popular, especially since they have a distribution deal with Tencent now. They're the second biggest in China after SM. BTS also had a scandal in China where they were blacklisted for a while, but I think with Hybe's partnership with Tencent that's now over.",

Do you think that their interest in the West could be precisely because they don't have as much dominance in Asia, with the exception of Japan?",

But things happened and now they\u2019re a global group. JYP always wanted a western focus cause they had a JYP NY office before where G-soul and Miss A Min largely trained at. JYP plan is now glocalization\u2014 globalization by localization, and that\u2019s why instead of having more groups with mixed members, they are now focusing on local markets with USA next target with A2K.\n\nJYP has less interest in Chinese money probably because of multiple reasons\u2014 it\u2019s volatile, Kpop is good one day very bad the other day depending on the whims of the regime, the lack of established artist from China\u2014even Miss A didn\u2019t really breakthrough there unlike SM groups, and maybe lastly the lack of Chinese business backers of JYPE\u2014-I think majority of their share holders are korean based unlike some other companies that have chinese businesses backing them.",

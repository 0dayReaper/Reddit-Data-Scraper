    "postText": "Hello! I've seen a lot of questions on r/kpophelp and elsewhere asking where and how to start buying albums. As a slightly grumpy but ultimately kind-hearted K-pop fandom elder (shawol since 2008) I want to help! It can seem really overwhelming at first and I definitely made mistakes, didn't know where to start, or ended up overpaying for albums I could have bought cheaper elsewhere. This guide is meant to walk you, a baby K-pop fan, through the process of buying an album, led by me, a grumpy K-pop fandom elder who has been in this for a over a decade and is significantly more broke because of it. For context, I live in the UK, but I\u2019ve tried to make this guide accessible for a global audience.\n\n**1.\tHow do K-pop albums work?**\n\nInside an album, as well as the CD, you\u2019ll always find a photobook, at least one tradeable photocard with a member or group picture on it, a poster and usually some other inclusions like stickers or a standee. If you pre-order an album before its release you\u2019ll also often get a pre-order gift, which can be anything from photocards to an extra photobook; sometimes specific shops may offer pre-order gifts in addition to those provided by the company. Albums often have more than one version with variations in the styling in the photobook, poster, photocards etc. You can choose to collect them all (expensive, but satisfying) or just pick your fave version. Likewise, there\u2019s a roaring trade in photocards if you want to collect a specific group member, which is a bit beyond the scope of this guide. \n\nA new album comes sealed with all the contents and your choice of photocard, poster and even sometimes album version is totally random. Used albums are often missing the poster/photocard/other inclusions, or these items can be bought separately. I\u2019ll outline the pros and cons of each method briefly below.\n\n**2.\tBuying new albums: pros and cons**\n\nLet\u2019s start with the pros: when buying new, you get all of the album inclusions, including pre-order gifts if you pre-order before the album is released. Ordering or buying in person from an official retailer is very straightforward, in some cases you can literally walk into a shop and buy an album these days. However, the most expensive option for album buying is usually music retailers local to you; more expensive, or comparable, to the cost of shipping an album from Korea using a site like ktown4u. In the US, Target and Walmart now stock K-pop albums from big groups (BTS, Blackpink, etc) and in the UK most big supermarkets (Tesco, ASDA) and some music retailers (HMV) also stock K-pop. Expect to pay anything from $20-$40 per album depending on the retailer. Also, your options are limited since only bigger groups are usually stocked, and out of print or older albums are impossible to find; you may have some luck in small K-pop specific shops, who might be able to order items in for you (such as Sokollab in London or Choice Music in LA). For those of us not lucky enough to live near a thriving metropolis though, online shopping is the way to go. \n\nThe second most expensive option are online stores such as YesAsia, ktown4u, kpoptown and GMarket (more on all of these later) Albums may look cheaper ($10-15 on average) but be wary of shipping fees which can easily double the price. If you\u2019re sensible with your ordering methods, the shipping can work out relatively cheap; however, be aware of customs charges, and additionally of customs charge scams, which are an emerging issue in K-pop merchandise (I don\u2019t see them talked about enough). There are ways to avoid customs charges, and excessive shipping, so read on! Online K-pop shops are great for bulk album buying, but some titles sell out quickly or go out of print, at which point they\u2019re almost impossible to find new. Another thing about buying from sellers like YesAsia: be prepared for shipping to take a long time. Like, a LONG time. I\u2019ve had orders ship in 2 weeks but I\u2019ve also had them take 6-8 weeks. \n\nThe final and likely the cheapest method of buying albums new is via a Group Order Manager (GOM); they are proxies between you and a Korean store or seller. People join a GO, usually by filling out a Google Form with their contact info, for a specific album(s) and the GOM then correlates all of these orders into a bulk order from one seller. This massively decreases shipping costs (and any customs fees) as it\u2019s then split between a big group of people. If your GOM is responsible, organised and honest, this is one of the best and cheapest ways to buy albums; many GOMs also unseal albums and sort photocards according to your bias preference! However, if your GOM is disorganised or dishonest, this can be time consuming and you may lose money and not get it back. \n\n**3.\tMore info on Group Orders**\n\nHere\u2019s how a group order usually works: you follow a GOM who specialises in the group(s) you stan on twitter/Instagram, and when they announce a comeback and a pre-order period, the GOM will open an order for that album. This may involve a couple of polls (e.g. an interest check, preference for EMS vs DHL shipping, limited edition album versus regular version, posters rolled vs. folded \u2013 all of which affect the baseline cost of the album for the buyers). Then the GOM will open an order form on Google forms, where you fill in your info. You will need to provide them, at minimum, with your full name, email, shipping address and sometimes your social media handle so they can identify you as a follower/if you need to DM about orders. \n\nThe GOM will ask for between 2-3 payments: the first, the base cost of the album (between $10-15); the second, the cost of shipping (and sometimes customs fees) from Korea to the GOM, split between all buyers; the third is domestic shipping from the GOM to you once the albums arrive. Some GOMs bundle together the base cost and Korea to GOM shipping and request this as the first payment, usually via email. It is good etiquette to make this initial payment promptly as the GOM needs all the buyer payments before they can bulk-buy albums; at the bare minimum, pay by the deadline stated on the form (it helps to take a screenshot of the form before it closes). Payments are almost always via PayPal, using the F&amp;F option. Any reputable GOM will accept payments via G&amp;S as long as you cover the fees (about $1-2), and in fact if a GOM refuses G&amp;S payments, this is a red flag and you shouldn\u2019t join their GO. Once the GOM has received all the payments they can order albums, which will take between 1-4 weeks to arrive to them depending on pre-order periods (some albums open pre-order further in advance, for example Japanese albums). The GOM will then receive the albums, sort photocards if required, package them individually and make their domestic shipping request via email. Domestic shipping is usually $3-5 unless you get a really heavy album(s); again, pay this promptly, because as soon as the GOM gets your payment they can start sending album packages to you. Expect this to take about 3-7 days to reach you as 1st class shipping is often too expensive and most GOMs will used 2nd class to save everyone money. \n\n**UPDATES:** You should expect regular updates from GOMs on twitter/Instagram when they are organising a GO for albums, usually related to shipping, packing, and when they\u2019ve sent out reminder emails. Please do not pester GOMs for information and remain polite in your DMs/emails to them. If you are rude to a GOM this can get you blacklisted, and for good reason. Most GOMs don\u2019t make a profit from their ordering and they put a lot of effort into what they do; they\u2019re essentially doing a massive favour for groups of strangers on the internet. In 2nd gen days GOs were often the ONLY way to get K-pop albums. If something goes wrong with the GO, the GOM should promptly contact and/or refund buyers \u2013 but remember that they are human too! \n\nIf all goes well, your GO will take slightly more time that directly buying an album, but it will inevitably work out much cheaper; and often, you\u2019re guaranteed at least one item of your bias in the album! If you\u2019re looking for a GOM to start out with, look for recommendations from friends, check their reviews (often customers post pictures/proof under a specific hashtag) and even DM them to get to know them before joining a GO.\n\n**WHAT TO AVOID:** Be wary of new GOMs, not just because of scams where a new GOM ghosts you and takes your money, but because lack of experience can sometimes lead to mistakes. When in doubt, always pay Goods&amp;Services. Learn how to open a PayPal claim before paying for anything. Also be wary of GOMs who are underage, as you may end up dealing with their parents/guardians when things go wrong (this is infrequent but it does happen). I\u2019ve already said to avoid GOMs who refuse G&amp;S payments but it bears repeating. Be cautious also of GOMs who run too may orders at once, I would say any more than 10+ orders is a red flag. The best case scenario is that the GOM is a bit slow or disorganised with managing so many orders at once; the worst case scenario is that the orders get so overwhelming that the GOM gets too stressed, ghosts buyers and takes their money with them. I am also personally wary of GOMs who charge commission on items, this is rare for albums but I see it a lot with expensive, rare or limited edition items like concert merch; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong, as sometimes it can be costly and difficult to get hold of items, but I would always calculate the cost/profit they may be making before entering a GO that charges commission. As long as you do your research, most of these situations shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\n**4.\tStores selling K-pop albums**\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by the names (and sometimes website designs) of these sites: they are legitimate and safe to use, with due caution. I\u2019ll start with shops that have an English interface; all of the below also have options for English, Mandarin, Japanese and Korean. I've ranked each shop with pros (+), cons (-) and both/neither (+/-) These are all shops that I or trusted friends have used in the past unless otherwise stated.\n\n**Amazon:**\n\n(+) It\u2019s Amazon, you already know how to use it. It\u2019s fast (especially with Prime), ordering is easy, and you can pre-order albums easily too.\n\n(-) Albums are more expensive (think $20-40)\n\n(-) Difficult to find rare, out of print, or smaller group\u2019s albums\n\n(+/-) You are giving money to Jeff Bezos, who has the capacity and the resources to end world hunger but chooses not to.\n\n**Official retailers such as Weverse Shop (Bighit Entertainment), SM Shop, etc:**\n\nI can only talk about my experience of Weverse Shop, formerly Bighit Shop, as the others I\u2019ve never used. I do know that stocking is very inconsistent across the board when buying directly from companies; items sell out fast and they likely won\u2019t notify you when items are restocked.\n\n(+) Excellent packaging, always arrive in sturdy boxes with lots of bubble wrap.\n\n(+) Album is guaranteed to count for all Korean charts, if you care about that kind of thing. *If you care about albums charting in Korea/locally then check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TXTbighit/comments/as54lf/album_buying_preorder_guide/) on r/TXTBigHit*\n\n(-) Albums are expensive, shipping is slow and expensive, and customs fees are pretty much a dead cert if your purchase is worth over $20.\n\n**YesAsia:** [US here](https://www.yesasia.com/us/en/home.html);[Rest of the world here](https://www.yesasia.com/global/en/home.html)\n\n(+) This is a great place to start buying albums. \n\n(+) Their shipping is usually free over $40, which means you don\u2019t have to worry about calculating price/weight or choosing shipping options, and additionally I\u2019ve never had any customs charges on items from YesAsia. (for reference: if you buy anything over $15 and import it, it\u2019s eligible for customs charges. I won\u2019t tell you how to avoid them, as this would be illegal.) *(NOTE: Due to COVID-19 the free shipping option is currently for purchases over $80)*\n\n(-) Prices are higher as a result of free shipping, so it may work out more expensive anyway; my advice is, fill your basket on YesAsia and a couple of other sites, make a spreadsheet and compare prices.\n\n(+) Albums are always pretty well-packaged with lots of bubble wrap and cardboard, I\u2019ve never had any arrive damaged. You have the option to choose the poster either folded, or in a tube at additional cost of about $3. \n\n(+/-) You can choose either random or specific versions of albums, but be aware that the specific versions sell out fast and after an album has been out for a few months, you\u2019ll only be able to buy random versions. \n\n(+) YesAsia is a great place to order heavy items like DVDs or repackage albums which are heavier and would otherwise get charged extra shipping from other sites. \n\n(+) They have a good stock of older albums (think SHINee, Bigbang, BAP, Infinite, Wonder Girls, SNSD) and also sometimes stock signed albums (these are limited edition from MWave and sell out fast). \n\n(-) Can take weeks or even months for albums to arrive, it\u2019s very hit or miss.\n\n**Ktown4u:** [Ktown4u](https://www.ktown4u.com/)\n\n(+) Good prices ($10-15 per album) and usually very well packaged with lots of bubble wrap\n\n(+) _Incredible_ discounts if you follow promo links on twitter (just google \"ktown4u [album name] discount link\")\n\n(+/-) Cheap shipping, but you will need to select shipping options yourself and it can get confusing. \n\n(-) Album sell out FAST on ktown4u but they restock regularly so it\u2019s worth checking every few weeks to see if an item is back in stock. \n\n(-) Customer service can be variable\n\n(+) Some GOMs will open a GO specifically to order albums from any artist off ktown4u and then split shipping between buyers. \n\n**Kpopmart:** [Kpopmart](https://kpopmart.com/)\n\n(+) Decent packaging and a good selection of albums at average prices\n\n(+) Some older albums (2nd gen) are regularly in stock\n\n(+/-) Album versions are random so you won\u2019t get to choose the cover or photobook that you want\n\n(-) Very slow shipping\n\n(-) Have previously been caught doing sketchy things (like selling fake signed albums) so be wary.\n\n**Kpoptown:** [Kpoptown](https://www.kpoptown.com/)\n\n(+) Very good packaging and fast reliable shipping, with average prices\n\n(+) Generally good customer service.\n\n(-) Again, no real choice of album versions\n\n(+/-) Kind of just \"okay\" as stores go, they're not terrible but not the best.\n\n**MyMusicTaste:** [Mymusictaste](https://www.mymusictaste.com/projects/)\n\n(+/-) A new entry to the kpop album selling world, MMT usually work as an international fan platform where fans can request their idols come to play concerts in their city. You can back campaigns for free to compete with other cities for funding for tour stops in your city, and backers usually get some kind of discount and/or VIP code if the artist does play a concert in the selected city. This is a great strategy for rookie groups who otherwise can\u2019t afford to tour internationally, as MMT funds the tour; additionally, MMT have begun funding kickstarter-like campaigns for albums for rookie or independent groups. \n\n(+) You can get albums for groups who do not sell via other platforms, exclusive signed albums, entries to international fansigns, or limited edition goods.\n\n(-) You will pay a premium for this. The albums are more expensive than usual ($20-40) and will still be shipped from Korea, often with more expensive shipping options (such as EMS) as the only choice.\n\n(+) You can support independent artists (Holland recently ran a kickstarter-style campaign for his first album)\n\n(+) Albums are usually well-packaged in sturdy boxes with lots of bubble wrap\n\n(+/-) NOTE: I have personal reasons to distrust MMT. I bought items from them in the past and had no customs fees, but recently I bought an item shipped via DHL and paid customs fees on it. So did some friends of mine. All four of us, several days after paying customs fees, received phone calls from scammers claiming to be DHL, demanding further customs fees. This kind of scam is common when customer\u2019s personal info is leaked during customs/transit of a parcel. While blame cannot be placed exclusively with MMT in this instance, and may lie with DHL, we do not know how the scammers got hold of this information. This is something to be very wary of when buying any K-pop merch online. Items may be shipped through multiple countries and you risk your private information being leaked even if you are relatively cautious, as I am. \n\n**5.\tBuying from Korean shops**\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you. I can read Hangul, but I don\u2019t speak Korean. If you do, then these shops may be great options for you! \n\n+ **Yes24:** Recently they added English as part of their interface but it's still a challenge to use. [Yes24 global](https://global.yes24.com/)\n\n+ **Synnara:** Interface is incredibly clunky and confusing with some English but mostly Korean. I know GOMs who have tutorials on how to use it if you're interested, but it's not a site I've ever used. [Synnara global](https://www.synnara.co.kr/so/kpopglobalorder.do)\n\n+  **MWave:** The only place you can buy *legit* signed albums. I wouldn't trust *anywhere else*. Usually very limited editions so the albums sell out in minutes/hours and will take months to ship and arrive. English user interface has massively improved in recent years. [Mwave](https://www.mwave.me/en/kpop-store/cd?ctgr=9002)\n\n+ **GMarket:** GMarket is possible to navigate with the help of tutorials and is essentially a bit like eBay, in that the quality of items/packaging and shipping cost/speed varies depending on the shop you use. This [old guide to K-pop album buying](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/62z35t/breakdown_of_the_different_kpop_online_shops/) has a really great guide of how to use GMarket. I've really only scratched the surface of using it and haven't been brave enough to order albums yet. I've also heard that customs fees are very hit or miss when ordering.\n\n**6.\tBuying second-hand K-pop albums**\n\nBuying used is the absolute cheapest way you can get a K-pop album. I have bought an album off eBay for \u00a32 before, and people even sometimes give them away for free \u2013 FOR FREE! However, your album may not include all the extras (photocards, posters, etc) and may be slightly worn or damaged. You can get incredible deals on almost-new albums without photocards, particularly as photocard collectors sometimes bulk buy many albums for the PC and then want to resell them. Buying second-hand is sometimes the only way to find rare, out of print or older albums (speaking as a very broke shawol, the struggle is real). If you buy your second-hand albums from someone local, they will arrive much faster, have cheaper shipping, and be far less damaging for the environment than shipping via airmail from Korea. There\u2019s also something nice about buying from a fellow fan \u2013 lots of sellers include fanmade stickers and PCs as cute extras when you buy from them! If buying an album w/o PC, you may be able to buy the PC separately so you can choose your bias.\n\nBuying secondhand is not without its disadvantages though. People can and will resell for absurd prices if they\u2019re out to make a fast buck, relying on fans lack of knowledge and desperation to exploit them. This happens a lot with rare and high demand items, with sellers sometimes misrepresenting how rare an item actually is (looking at you, BTS merch sellers). If you\u2019re not careful, you can get scammed, so stick to reputable sites that include buyer protection and familiarise yourself with how to make a claim if your item doesn\u2019t turn up. Again, if you MUST pay PayPal, use Goods&amp;Services. Competition on sites like eBay can be fierce so you may get beaten to a deal if you\u2019re not speedy enough; but be wary of sellers that artificially inflate prices or deliberately stoke bidding wars. If a seller has an album listed for a low price (&lt;$10), message them an offer of that price or slightly higher; if they\u2019re not willing to negotiate price, it\u2019s likely that they WANT a bidding war so that the album will go for higher than it\u2019s worth. Unless it was exceptionally rare, I\u2019d never pay more than $15 (\u00a310) for a second-hand album w/o PC. \n\nIt\u2019s vitally important that before starting buying second-hand, you set yourself 1) a clear budget, and 2) an ISO list. Know exactly what you\u2019re looking for, down to the album version and the maximum you\u2019re willing to pay for it. Don\u2019t pay above your maximum price, even if it means missing out on buying an album you want. K-pop albums are far more common than some sellers like to make them out to be; frequently people will sell their entire collection for reasonable prices. Patience is key!\n\n**eBay:**\n\n(+) Some incredible deals but need to be speedy \u2013 most albums w/o PCs sell for $5-15\n\n(+) Rare items often for sale\n\n(+) International platform so possible to buy items from Korea\n\n(+) Easy interface to interact with\n\n(+) TIP: if you \u201cwatch\u201d an album, the seller will sometimes DM you a reduced price offer for it.\n\n(+) The main platform that PC collectors will use to offload spare albums for cheap prices\n\n(+/-) Check a seller\u2019s profile before buying an item to see if they have anything else you\u2019re interested in; they may offer a bundle on items and secure you a good deal!\n\n(-) Be wary of international shipping which may be a hidden fee (I\u2019ve been burned before)\n\n(-) If you do want PCs or extras, it can be hard to find albums with these and they will sell quickly!\n\n(+/-) Shipping price, speed and packaging varies wildly by seller. I\u2019ve had some really good, fast orders, but I\u2019ve also had some that took months to arrive (usually internationally)\n\n**Depop:**\n\n(+) Again, an easy interface to use and browse\n\n(+/-) Sellers are only local to you unless you choose otherwise; some may be more or less willing to ship internationally. This also means that shipping may be less within your country.\n\n(+/-) Albums w/o PCs will be more expensive on here than eBay ($15-30) but sometimes you\u2019ll get an absolute steal \u2013 for example when someone clears out their entire K-pop collection you can get albums for $5.\n\n(+) Sellers are more open to offers and bundle deals \u2013 it\u2019s courtesy to DM the seller before buying so this can be easy to organise.\n\n(+/-) You may have some luck with finding items you want by making an ISO post on your profile listing the albums you\u2019re after, but this also tends to invite spammers into your DMs.\n\n**Mercari:**\n\nI have no personal experience using this, but it\u2019s basically Japanese eBay. Its user interface *is* in English but it's easier to navigate in Japanese. Irritatingly, they show sold items in search results as well as on sale items. Here are some tips! (credit to u/i_cruceru)\n\n(+) You can find really good deals, especially for Japanese albums/merch. Rare items also tend to run cheaper on mercari.\n\n(+) You can browse without an account. Better results come up if you use Japanese keywords, but English ones work fine.\n\n(-) You cannot buy from mercari directly unless you speak Japanese and have a Japanese address to ship your items to (and possibly a jp phone number to sign up). You'd have to use a proxy and that comes with additional fees. There's a few popular ones, but I've only used Japonica market. They were nice and fast, but pretty expensive.\n\n(-) As always, be wary of fake merch, it's almost impossible to get a refund through a proxy if the item turns out to be fake.\n\n**FINAL TIPS: Always compare prices, keep and stick to a budget, and if you order a load of albums, keep receipts and records, then check off when you receive something!**\n \n*edit: a word",

            "comment": "Thank you for the guide! However... it is a little bit misleading to suggest that only Mwave can be trusted to purchase signed albums, and here\u2019s why:\n* MWAVE signed albums are RETAIL copies, meaning that they will have the regular KOMCA sticker, as opposed to PROMO albums with a silver Bimae sticker or, in the case of recent Bighit albums - no sticker or a NOT FOR SALE sticker. For some people it makes no difference, but collectors know that PROMO copies are regarded to as more valuable.\n* When buying from MWAVE, especially if it\u2019s a popular group, the signatures can look extremely smudged and messy because the groups sign large volumes of albums. Signatures on promo albums are usually neater looking.\n* A PROMO / bimae / not for sale album was usually handed out during a group\u2019s promotions FOR FREE to broadcasting companies, radio stations, music video staff, other groups etc. \n* There are many reputable promo album sellers on Ebay, such as Hallyusuperstore, Grapemusiccd, Handollmaking, mojasajo, ramikoko etc. If you\u2019re not sure if the album is legit - just ask! there are certain red flags to look for, such as marker pressure (whether it was written by someone naturally, or an attempt to carefully replicate, in which case the marker pressure will visibly vary), and a lot of fans are familiar with how a real signature looks like.\n* Be advised that when purchasing promo albums from SM Entertainment, there CAN be cases when they\u2019re signed by a manager and not the group itself.\n* In general it is very unlikely that a BIMAE album has a fake signature. The only cases in which an artist will have an UNSIGNED bimae album is when the comeback was a DIGITAL release. So usually less worries about whether the signatures are legitimate or not. \n* If the album has a \u201cSigned to\u201d message, then that\u2019s also a good indicator that it\u2019s legit, since it\u2019s usually a personal message from the group to a producer, camera director etc.",

Mwave is a good place to _start_ for newbies to K-pop album buying, e.g. if a new fan wants to try and get an album signed by their bias by joining a GO, their best bet is an Mwave GO. I reckon signed albums and other specialist goods could do with a whole extra post so I just mentioned Mwave as the main \"official\" seller of signed retail copies and therefore the most accessible to newbies :)",

The first album to have photocards was SNSD's Oh!, so anything from before this won't. Also some more of SNSD's albums don't have photocards, even to their latest ones (off the top of my head, Run Devil Run, I Got A Boy, and Mr.Mr don't) and I'm sure they're not the only ones/the only artist like this..\n\nI know a lot of people won't collect older groups but I wanted to say this anyway because I'd hate for someone to receive an album and be confused why there isn't a photocard when there isn't meant to be!",

I\u2019m not entirely sure but: It seems to be time limited rather than quantity limited or am I wrong? When a signed album shows up there\u2019s a sales period listed and from my experience it just says \u201eSold out soon\u201c maybe two days before the end so it seems to be time limited.",

Five of us tried for any/all versions and our GOM got hold of about 6 but the rest of us found each version sold out as we were going through the checkout. Could have been just because GOT7 is massive because smaller groups I've also seen the time limit like you describe.",

Rare items also tend to run cheaper on mercari.\n\n(+) You can browse without an account. Better results come up if you use japanese keywords, but english ones work fine.\n\n(-) You cannot buy from mercari directly unless you speak japanese and have a japanese address to ship your items to (and possibly a jp phone number to sign up). You'd have to use a proxy and that comes with aditional fees. There's a few popular ones, but i've only used Japonica market. They were nice and fast, but pretty expensive. \n\n(-) As always, be wary of fake merch, it's almost impossible to get a refund through a proxy if the item turns out to be fake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for customs, try and find things out from locals as they vary wildly from country to country. You can get valuable information about how to avoid them. For my romanian peeps, with the regular post is relatively easy to avoid taxes; other couriers will always charge customs and other import taxes, even an extra tax for doing the customs formalities for you (looking at you DHL, please avoid it if you can, the extra fees are insane).",

(I live in the States, and I usually get my orders within a week of placing them.)\n\n( - ) Shipping can be expensive because of that, lol\n\n( - ) If you're buying used albums, it's impossible to tell for sure what condition they're in before they arrive, as they can't show you photos of it beforehand, or if they come with any of the original PCs and goodies. Sometimes it'll mention in a comment on the page if there's damage or if the PC comes with, but not always.\n\n( - ) The website can be a bit hard to navigate sometimes, since it's geared towards Japanese users.\n\nThis is honestly my go-to store for older groups. I almost always buy used, and I have personally never had an issue with the condition my albums came in.

I agree big GOMs usually have enough proof that F&amp;F for tax reasons is fine even for a first time buyer, but it's a case of doing research and building trust with your individual GOM (probably worth mentioning, being from the UK, even our biggest GOMs don't have the tax issue because the orders are so small haha!)\n\n&gt;It\u2019s rarely the GOM themselves that\u2019s change the cost, but rather their Korean supplier who lines up for hours to get the merch.\n\nYep, spot on, I know first-hand how stressful and complex getting hold of concert merch in bulk is! Understandable that for this specifically, Korean and Japanese suppliers will charge commission. I'd be a bit sus over charging commission on albums though (which is what this post is mainly aimed at).",

I always wanted to see a list of major sellers of albums for other groups since for BTS I always bought on BigHit shop/Weverse, however I bought from MWave only one time so it was my only experience since I then decided not to buy from them anymore,but basically I bought a Gfriend signed \u201ctime for the moon night\u201d album (signed only by one member) and also a (G)I-file signed \u201cI Am album\u201d just a little after they debuted if I\u2019m not wrong. At first everything was going smoothly and after like 1-2 weeks that I didn\u2019t get any notice about my albums I checked and basically it said they were sold out...? After it was like shipped .... I then tried to contact them to get a refund but they never answered and I was never able to contact them in a way or the other so I decided I wouldn\u2019t buy from them anymore. I don\u2019t know if they got \u201cbetter\u201d or not since it was like 2 years ago but yeah, this was my experience",

Was I just lucky that the customs didn't catch the package or does YesAsia do any special declaration to get the package through customs?\n\nAlso, when I order from Ktown4U (never did yet), I saw that they make the note that the tax is excluded. Does this mean that I have to pay the tax in 100% of the cases because the people working at customs see this or can I also be lucky and the package gets through?\n\nMaybe you can enlighten me :-)",

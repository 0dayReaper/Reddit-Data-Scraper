    "postText": "AOA does yoga I heard.\nYuna ex-AOA is now a yoga instructor.\nhttps://www.allkpop.com/article/2021/12/former-aoa-member-yuna-reveals-she-has-become-a-successful-yoga-instructor\n\nThis piqued my interest. I wanted to know which kpop groups are doing yoga as a part of training? Is it isha Hatha Yoga? Which one do they learn?\n\nI secretly wish they would show their sadhana(practice) for inspiration. I'm really digging for content on kpop idols doing yoga.",

I can't find the video now but it was with a company called AVEC. From what I understand, the instructor they were working with also worked with Seventeen.\n\nI totally get it. It strengthens the core and makes their voices and breathing more stable even when they're jumping around on stage doing choreo. Vanner's claim to fame on the show was their incredibly stable live vocals and I think that yoga-like training and strengthening of the core helped out a lot.",

It's really an unusual way to train vocal and performance but it worked so well for Vanner. Their live performances are unreal!",

So if you look at the US album sales, it should give you a pretty good educated guess.",

They dont do world tours often because they arent focusing on usa advancement.\n\nSvt is very popular and their albums sales reflect that\n\nAteez, is also very popular over here in the usa their albums are very accessible now they can be bought at walmart/target/B&amp;N etc. I went to their concert last november and it was amazing! 17k+ fans. In more populated cities they are most likely to have 2 show dates. They are on the path to be very big like txt/stray kids, ateez come from an unknown label so they didnt have a built-in fanbase like other groups. Therefore ateez has to work 10x as hard and build their fandom.\n\nEnhypen are still rookies so their fandom is not as big as the other groups mentioned above.",

Their concept is what American fans like in bg's.\n\nPeople tell me that Stray Kids have a slight edge over TXT in terms of US fans. It's likely because TXT debuted cute/bright concept at first.\n\nSVT main fans were predominantly in Asia, but \"Hot\" release got a lot of fans in America.\n\nNCT is well established in the US. Heck, there was even a Korean boycott when they promoted Superhuman in the US. As a 3rd gen group that didn't debut cute/bright like Seventeen, they got a headstart on their American fan base.",

Would be interesting to see the changes at different peaks for different time zones. You might find that the order changes when America is most active vs when Europe is most active, or not.\n\nAlso, ateez has two dedicated subs ran by different people, r/ateez and r/8teez, so that muddles the numbers up a bit. I'd also imagine the numbers of all subs are affected by whether it's comeback season for that group or not.\n\nStill, I think that's a metric worth considering!",

Yeah, making rankings on popularity metrics between groups can be seen in this sub as disrespectful (understandably so), especially as no metric is perfect, so it was to be expected.\n\nYou\u2019re completely right that there\u2019s a few confounding variables to this metric. Subs do get a boost in active users during comeback periods, but even then it seems like it doesn\u2019t have a huge impact on the rankings with both Enhypen and Aespa currently in the middle of comebacks but still having less lurkers than some other groups. I do wonder if the rankings would change much depending on the timezone, I don\u2019t think America and Europe are too different, but Australia might have a small impact depending on the group (e.g. Stray Kids, NewJeans). The biggest source of bias to this metric is Reddit\u2019s heavy bias to male users, it wouldn\u2019t affect the boy groups much but you\u2019d have to be careful about comparing girl groups with this metric. In the end like you said, a metric worth considering but only in context of every other metric, which it more or less seems consistent with.",

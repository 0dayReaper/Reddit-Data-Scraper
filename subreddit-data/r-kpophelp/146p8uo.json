I'm thinking of idols like Yuqi, Tzuyu, Renjun, Chenle etc. \n\nIf you met a person with a foreign name, you would try to get the pronunciation right, wouldn't you ?\n\nOf course different languages use different sounds and not everyone can replicate them, but I feel like it's a matter of respect to at least give it your best effort. Most people I know would consider it rude if you just changed the pronunciation of their name because of laziness.\n\nIs this just because I'm looking at this from a western point of view ? ",

            "comment": "\nTLDR; It\u2019s just the Korean way of pronouncing names or reading Hanja (Chinese characters). It\u2019s not a mispronunciation on purpose nor wrong or out of laziness. \n\n==\n\nBecause there\u2019s no equivalent in Korean. \n\nI speak Mandarin (though second language) and learnt Korean till an intermediate level and a lot of Chinese words can\u2019t be written exactly in Korean. \n\nI think the best they can do is \u201ctranslate\u201d(?) or \u201ctransliterate\u201d(?) their Chinese names using [Hanja](https://www.meridianlinguistics.com/translation-careers/what-are-hanja/). Yuqi (\u96e8\u7426) = \uc6b0\uae30 (Woo-ki) and technically it is correct. \u96e8 is read as \uc6b0 (\u201cwoo\u201d) in Korean ([Source](https://www.sayjack.com/korean/korean-hanja/characters/title:%E9%9B%A8/) if necessary). I don\u2019t know about \u7426 (q\u00ed) though. \uae30 (\u201cki\u201d) could just be the closest sound to it. \n\nIt\u2019s similar to how \u5927 is pronounced \u201cd\u00e0\u201d in Chinese but in Korean, it\u2019s \u201cdae\u201d. Both are correct and it\u2019s just a different pronunciation based on which language you\u2019re looking at it from. It\u2019s the same logic for some names like Yuqi, The8 (M\u00edng h\u00e0o \u2014&gt; \uba85\ud638 \u201cMyung-ho\u201d), and Jun (J\u00f9n hu\u012b \u2014&gt; \uc900\ud718 \u201cJun-hwee\u201d). \n\nThe opposite(?) is also true. There are many Korean names with Hanja meaning. And Koreans usually explain their names like this. For example, Seungkwan (\uc2b9\uad00) will explain and breakdown his name as:\n- \uc2b9: \u52dd (\u201csh\u00e8ng\u201d, to win/victory)\n- \uad00: \u5bec (\u201cku\u0101n\u201d, wide, broad, generous)\n\nAs you may tell, the Chinese pronunciation (\u201cSheng kuan\u201d) is closely similar to \u201cSeung kwan\u201d. \n\nOn the other hand, names like Chenle and Tzuyu, I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no Hanja equivalent, so they use the closest Korean spelling which is \ucc9c\ub7ec (\u201cCheon leo\u201d) and \ucbd4\uc704 (\u201cZzeu wui\u201d). The romanization looks horrible but I don\u2019t know how to properly encapsulate it in English haha. \n\nWe also have to remember that Korean isn\u2019t tonal like Mandarin. Hence it\u2019s not that people are changing the pronunciation of their names on purpose. But it\u2019s just the absolute closest pronunciation possible in Korean. Plus a lot of non-Chinese speakers cannot get the [4 Chinese tones](https://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Four_tones). \u201cZhang hao\u201d becomes \u201c\uc7a5\ud558\uc624\u201d (\u201cJang ha-oh\u201d), similar to \u201cZh\u0101ng h\u0101o\u201d, instead of \u201cZh\u0101ng h\u00e0o\u201d. His name essentially becomes very \u201cflat\u201d and \u201ch\u0101o\u201d is another word different from the right pronunciation, \u201ch\u00e0o\u201d. But there\u2019s no choice because Koreans just aren\u2019t used to the 4 tones. \n\nI mean even my own English name gets \u201cmispronounced\u201d in Korean so what more for Chinese names. For example, if my name was Ricky, Koreans will call me \u201clicky\u201d. And it\u2019s not wrong because there\u2019s no \u201cR\u201d in Korean. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if my answer answers your question though haha ;;\n\nETA\n\n(Thanks for the award kind stranger \ud83d\ude06)",

The q in Mandarin Pinyin is an aspirated consonant that is similar to ch but \"flatter.\" Korean has an identical sound (\u314a), but no English IPA is quite the same.\n\nIf Yuqi (* Note to non-Mandarin speakers: the u in Yu is an umlaut \u00fc so it does NOT sound like the English u, either!) had her Mandarin name transliterated in the official Romanization, it would become \uc704\uce58, which happens to be the Korean word for \"location.\" If Chinese/Chinese diaspora idols followed the Korean Hanja pronunciation, Tzuyu/Ziyu would have become \uc790\uc720/\"freedom\" instead of \ucbd4\uc704, while Cao Lu would have become \uc870\ub85c/\"aging early\" instead of the phonetic \ucc28\uc624\ub8e8. Cheng Xiao even had to become \uc131\uc18c(Seong So) because her Sino-Korean name(\uc815\uc18c) is the Korean word for... uh... \"testes.\" They probably switched it to \uc131 because that's the Sino-Korean phonetic for \u6210, which shares the same pinyin with her last name \u7a0b(ch\u00e9ng).",

                            "comment": "I feel like you're conflating Taiwanese Mandarin and Hokkien into one thing when you say \"Taiwanese\" and it's making your post a bit confusing. Taiwanese Mandarin is just Mandarin spoken with a Taiwanese accent, while Hokkien is effectively a different language. While some sounds are pronounced differently between Taiwanese Mandarin and Standard Mandarin, there happens to be zero difference for Tzuyu/\u5b50\u745c. It's legit pronounced the exact same by Taiwanese people and Chinese people. If you mean different in Hokkien, neither video you linked says Tzuyu in Hokkien.\n\nThere IS an accent difference for Shuhua (it's closer to \"Suhua\" in Taiwanese Mandarin while the h sound is fuller in Standard Mandarin) if you want to hold that conversation. I do find that people are generally not very picky with other people's native accents so long as they can 100% communicate/speak the same language though.\n\nI think it's also viewed different between English and languages like Mandarin or Korean, because while names in English can be spelled the same but pronounced very differently depending on the person's wishes, in Mandarin/Korean every character has a set sound. Like, Andrea can be \"Ahn-dray-uh\" or \"Ann-dree-ya\" or \"Ahn-dree-ya\" in English, and all variations are correct, while \uc9c0\uc5f0 will always be Jiyeon\u2014there's no Korean out there insisting their name \uc9c0\uc5f0 be pronounced Giyoon. That's just not how their language works\u2014if she wanted to be Giyoon, she'd change her name to \uae30\uc724. \n\nAs a result, I think in Korean and Mandarin, \"mispronouncing\" a name by saying it in a different accent isn't seen as a mispronunciation, it's just regular accent stuff. It's not a thing to insist on someone else to change their pronunciation exclusively for names because sounds are consistent in those languages, whereas it's totally normal in English to correct pronunciation because our alphabet is woefully inadequate at representing sounds consistently.\n\nI do think it's sweet gesture from fans/non-speakers to learn someone's name in their accent, but I also feel like saying that other accents aren't the \"correct\" pronunciation is kinda weird too. I mean, how far does it go? There are accents within Taiwan as well\u2014city-dweller accents, countryside accents, gangster accents, not to mention regular old regional accents\u2014how far does this need for the \"correct\" pronunciation go?",

Rechecking the video for the pronunciation, it says Taiwanese Mandarin, which I believe (to my English only ears) I got correct by saying that the way she was teaching Da Hyun is different from the way she pronounced her name in her apology video, which I believe was spoken in Beijing dialect. Please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nPersonally, I'm very *politically aware* about proper pronunciation because my long time favorite actress is \u738b\u7956\u8ce2 / Joey Wong Jyo Yin (Cantonese), Wang Tsu Hsien (Taiwanese Mandarin) and I used to be scolded when I visited the video stores, being told \"SHE'S TAIWANESE, HER NAME IS WANG!\". Since this was in the pre-internet days, it too years before I learned the proper way to pronounce her name in Taiwanese Mandarin. \n\nBTW, could you confirm that her name in Hokkien is Ong Jo Hen? I was told this by a couple of Taiwanese girls I met a time ago. \n\nIt's no longer available, but there was a Youtube clip of her appearance on a Korean variety show in the late 80's/early 90's where the host tries to introduce her as Wang Tsu Hsien in Mandarin and she politely corrects him because of his mispronunciation. \n\nAs for mutual understanding, on an episode of *Running Man* when they were in Hong Kong, the mission was to find someone on the street whose surname was Wang. I was LOL as the team was struggling, as they obviously couldn't find anyone who was Wang, but several who were Wong. I'm not sure if they were feigning ignorance, but finally the PD said to ask for Wong, and they immediately found someone!",

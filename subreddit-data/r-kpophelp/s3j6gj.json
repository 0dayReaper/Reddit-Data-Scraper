Though it doesn't make it any less weird. \n\nFor instance, Take Me Home Jongho's part could've been \"Tell me where I go to the other side\" but it has one extra syllable which breaks the flow. We could also change the go to cross but it adds in total two extra syllables and oh my god does it make me feel even more restless than the original. \nI could give more examples if needed but here is some stuff I have no explanation for:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe whole wonderland intro rap thingy of Hongjoong's... \nLike, it's grammatically correct, but make it make sense. \n\"All eyes on me now\" - okay that's fine\n\"If you still doubt mine\" - doubt what? \ud83d\ude2d I've always thought it was \"if you still doubt time\" which still doesn't make sense in that context but it's a lot better\n\"It's too pointless\" - what is pointless- HONGJOONG WHAT IS IT\n\"We're still young and wild\nWe gonna find, new world to be mine\" -these last two lines ore perfectly fine imo\n\nDazzling light Hongjoong's \n\"Here we go\nHere we\nWe just wanna take you there\" - i can actually explain it but it just annoys me. It's because of the flow, im pretty sure they've cut out the \"are\" from the second \"here we\" because after that mingi's lines go\n\"Where we go\nWhere we are\nWhat we wanna say\"\nSo yea\n\nNext is... You guessed it right, Hongjoong again... \nIn mist in the middle of his rap he goes \"I want you to be make me sure\" i think this was added for the sole purpose of filling the lyrics. This part of the song is actually very meaningful and adding this line kind of kills it for me when I start to analyze it \ud83e\udd27\n\n\"Play like a rocky, like him\nNow we gon\u2019 be winning like that\" \nif that's familiar, this is Hongjoong's intro part in WIN. I have nothing to say here. \n\"Get on up we're gon' lit\" - mingi... You were my last hope. Jk, he actually says this so fast i don't even hear anything except for \"get up lit\" \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThen we have someone new, Yeosang's part in Sunrise. \n\"No matter what the things that make you sick\"\nThey should've just discarded the what ;-; uhh idk who is LEEZ or BUDDY but these guys could get some help here and there ;-;\n\nThat was for all to action. I have all the time in the world but I'm not gonna make you suffer anymore \ud83e\udd23 if you feel like reading more of my rant just say so, i could go on forever (until the songs end but that's a fucking lot)",

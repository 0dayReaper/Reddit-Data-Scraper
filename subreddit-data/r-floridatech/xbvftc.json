    "postText": "Trying to get into a doctorate clinical psychology program for 2023. I was wondering if there are any PsyD students that could answer some questions for me\n\n1. How do you like your classes? (specifically forensic psychology ones)\n\n2. Did you get any financial aid from the school? \n\n3. Do you feel like the school is supportive of you? \n\n4. What are your favorite and least favorite parts of the program?\n\n5. Any advice is appreciated! :)\n\nthanks for all your help in advance &lt;3",

    "postText": "Hey guys!\n\nWe have started a Minecraft server just for university students! Since quarantine is looking like it may be going for a while, we made a new Minecraft server and Discord community to help us get through it with a little more sanity. Minecraft University is a Spigot Minecraft server dedicated to giving the community the closest Vanilla-feel as possible. Our server runs on **1.15.2** and whitelist is **enabled.**\n\nIf you want to join us, go to our [website](https://minecraftuniversity.net/) and get verified. You can also join straight in to our Discord server at [https://discord.gg/TcMzT7P](https://discord.gg/TcMzT7P)  \n\nBecause we are exclusive to university students, we do verify that each player is a university student. All you need is your .edu email and your usernames for Discord and Minecraft, then just go to the get verified page on our website. If you have any questions, feel free to send us a DM.\n\nWe look forward to playing with y\u2019all!",

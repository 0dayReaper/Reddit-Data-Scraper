    "postText": "I recently got an admit in MS Computer Information Systems at Florida Tech, USA for spring 23. Though other universities that I have applied to have not yet rolled out their admissions, I am thinking about enrolling in this university if no other option.\n\nI would like to know more about the university and about the course. Please do tell how good the university is!\n\nIf any already enrolled students of FIT please dm me!\n\nThanks in advance!",

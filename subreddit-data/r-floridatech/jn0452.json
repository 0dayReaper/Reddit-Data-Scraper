    "postText": "Hi! I'm a current HS senior, pretty interested in electrical or computer engineering, and maybe minoring in biology/chemistry. I'm considering FIT, as well as some other tech schools and my local state university. Would you guys recommend FIT? How are the FIT electrical/computer engineering programs? What is the campus life like? (Unfortunately, I'm not gonna get a chance to visit.) I know these are pretty general/subjective questions, I just want to get a sense of what the experience is like. Thanks!",

I am extremely happy with the education I received as well as the friendliness and flexibility of the professors. \n\nAny school experience is going to be limited by both the work you put in and the experiences made available to you by the school. I thought the variety of options within departments to experience different sub disciplines was very good. I especially liked having major relevant courses starting freshman year as opposed to waiting until common courses were out of the way.\n\nEdit: I am happy to chat over zoom or similar medium about my experiences.",

If you don't get good scholarships, the debt you will leave with is not worth the education you will receive. Also, be wary of the scholarships you do receive, the University has a tendency to only provide in the first semester. Employers will not know FIT from any community college, outside of Brevard County. Your employment opportunities in Brevard are pretty much the L3-Harris Corporation, which pays next to nothing(Worked there for 5 years without seeing any pay raise). Small classes are great, until you get stuck taking a class with a prof who has no interest in teaching, and has a grad student running everything who wants nothing to do with teaching either. This was most of my undergrad experience, especially with the ECE department. There are a handful of great teachers that care about teaching, but a majority are there to do their research and teaching is an unfortunate annoyance. \n\nI graduated with a BS in EE in '09, and sat next to my professors and faculty at job interviews. I landed in another field due to lack of opportunity in Melbourne at the time (Peak of the economic crash).",

            "comment": "FIT is a bit of a weird one for me. One the one hand I can assuredly say that it is the reason I will have a career doing what I love (applying for the DoD SMART program is strongly recommend!). I dove head first into research when I first got on campus. As an OE interested in robotics, I was able to start working on a research team building a seafloor crawler, then a cave-mapping ROV, and within a year, I was leading a project that is my pride and joy. I also got to work on a contract with the US Navy that has opened unbelievable doors for me. I am now getting paid ~$32,000/year to go school as a result.\n\nBUT, I sold my soul. I put in over 60 hours a week in my research lab. I do a lot that might be classified as \"extra\". I'm more than fortunate that my effort is being rewarded but I've seen the opposite occur much more frequently. $60,000+/year is *absurd* and while there are a few benefits, it's rough. It's expensive. I think the OE program is top-notch but frankly I haven't been impressed by the other majors. The MechE and EE curriculums are about par with my state college, which is about a fifth the price. A lot of friends I talk to in MechE and CS and that fun stuff say they regret going here and not saving tens of thousands by going to a community college or state school\n\nTL;DR there are many opportunities, if you put the work in, but would not recommend if you wanna just get a degree.",

If you have decent grades, FIT should at least give you a small scholarship to make it more price-competitive with a state university. \n\nThe  main benefit I saw at FIT were the small classes. You're more likely to talk with your teacher during class and you'll feel more pressure to do your work at FIT since you're not an anonymous face in a class of 50 or more students at a big state university.\n\nI also consider FIT's small campus a plus. It's annoying having to hop on a bus to get around a larger campus.\n\nMelbourne is great location for finding engineering jobs and internships too.",

            "comment": "Soo, I decided on FL tech because I am from Melbourne, Fl and also got a great merit based scholarship. I was able to live with my parents and graduated with maybe $10-$15k in student loans that I was able to pay off in two years after school. I went for chemical engineering back in 2014. Someone else in the comments mentioned FL Tech not really being known outside of Brevard, which I would say is mostly true. I don\u2019t think having FL tech on my resume hurt my chances of getting jobs (as I did get interviews after graduation), but I don\u2019t think it helped either. I\u2019m in Orlando now, and definitely the big companies here know about FL tech and actively hire from there. I\u2019d say you\u2019d have a great chance to work at L3-Harris, Northrop Grumman, or Lockheed Martin if you for for electrical engineering at Florida tech. Look into what you want to do after graduation and see if those companies match. Working in defense is much different than commercial companies.\n\nI\u2019d also like to add that a lot of my peers were not impressed with Melbourne. They thought it was kind of run down with not a lot to do. I think it\u2019s what you make of it, but that\u2019ll be up to you.\n\nOverall, I had a decent Florida tech experience. I liked my small class sizes and being able to be close with professors. I think my junior and senior classes had like 15-20 people tops. Because I was able to get to know my professors better, one was able to help me get an internship and later wrote me great letters of recommendation. I always wonder if I would\u2019ve had those same opportunities at a larger school. The small class sizes also made it easy to get to know your peers and work together. At least in ChE, we had a lot of project based courses.\n\nHonestly, to summarize, I\u2019d look into those 3 companies i mentioned. If you aren\u2019t interested in those, I would look for another school. Not to say you wouldn\u2019t be able to work anywhere else, but most likely it\u2019ll be one of those. Your experience will be much different at FL Tech just due to the size compared to other schools. I\u2019d you\u2019d prefer to be in a smaller crowd, it could be a good fit. Lastly, only go here if you have a great scholarship. The crazy tuition here is not offset by a superior education. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s not worth what the tuition is either (in my opinion)",

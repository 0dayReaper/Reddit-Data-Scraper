Florida Poly is a smaller upstart in a remote part of Florida (near Lakeland) between Orlando and Tampa. Off-topic, but if scholarships / tuition assistance aren't on the table then I'd recommend seeking in-state tuition where you are if that's a possibility. Unless you're looking to network with the big military and aerospace companies that recruit from FIT then just focus on getting your degree with as little debt as possible.",

FIT location is pretty good, close to the beach, close to restaurants and stores and such - it has some new buildings and dorms, but some parts of it are old and kind of run down. Both are academically good. FIT has been around longer so may be better known.  FIT has a good cafeteria.",

There are lots of international students at FIT, but most are US nationals, especially for undergrad. There are weird people wherever you go, but don't worry too much about \"Florida Man\" - there are people like that all over the world, you just hear about it more in Florida because of the 'sunshine laws' which allow newpapers access to many police records that are private in a lot of other states. If you are worried about the politics, yes it is an R area (about 60/40 voting wise) but the students tend to be liberal and not very political (as far as I know).",

Also, Melbourne isn't a hot spot for students, but Lakeland is even worse.\n\nBoth the State of Florida and FIT should have explored converting FIT to a state school. I don't think either considered it though.  FIT is in a better location and could have benefited greatly from state funding.",

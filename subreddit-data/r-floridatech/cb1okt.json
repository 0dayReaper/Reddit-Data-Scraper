            "comment": "If you only take 6 credits (aka 2 classes), it's going to take you longer to graduate. According to the [general PhD requirements](https://www.fit.edu/policies/graduate-policies/phd-policies/gp22---phddbaavd-course-requirements/), you have to take at least 4 classes with a grade (A, B, C, etc.) and at least 4 pass/fail courses like seminars. I you're taking 2 classes semester, it'll take you 4 semesters just to complete the course work.\n\nIf time isn't important to you, I don't see any minimum credits listed in the general requirements. The program itself might have a minimum though. You'd have to check the program guide or ask the CS advisor.",

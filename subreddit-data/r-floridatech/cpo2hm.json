    "postText": "I know orientation is tomorrow(today, technically) and I was reading through the guide or whatever it's called, and I realized I needed a Panther Pass Certificate. I've got zero clue as to what this is, and it says I need this. I've completed my Panther Pass entirely, the only unchecked sections being Final Reminders and Orientation, which I don't think can be. I've got no idea where to find this thing, and I'm not getting stopped after coming this far.\n\nAnyone who happen to see this before like, 2am know what to do here? I would be very thankful.",

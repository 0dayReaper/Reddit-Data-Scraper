    "postText": "Hi, I am a high school senior in Flordia and would like to know more about Florida Tech. I would like to know how good is the aerospace engineering perhaps compared to Embry-Riddle or UCF. I haven't visited yet but is Melbourne a really nice place to be? How was your experience there? Also, how are the job prospects after you graduate from FIT after getting a B.S. in aerospace engineering? Is it better than UCF or Embry? Thank you",

            "comment": "Since no one else is commenting, I'll try to help even though I'm not in aerospace...\n\nFIT and ERAU are fairly similar. FIT is slightly more selective than ERAU and has more resources (endowment and research funding) per student. FIT has a wider range of engineering majors and choices for minors. I'm pretty sure there are more aerospace companies in Melbourne than Daytona so getting an internship at FIT should be easier.\n\nI don't like that ERAU has 14,000 online students. They have more students online than on-campus. I think degrees earned online diminish the value of degrees earned on campus.\n\nERAU has a nicer campus than FIT, though. Also, Daytona has more to do than Melbourne since Daytona is a big tourist destination at certain times of the year. ERAU is highly specialized so if you're definitely only interested in aerospace and there's no possibility you want to switch majors or minor in a different field, ERAU might be a better choice. ERAU's campus is connected to the airport. FIT has buildings at the Melbourne airport, but the main campus is a couple miles down the road.\n\nUCF and FIT are difficult to compare. UCF is the largest university in the country and a public school. FIT has much smaller classes and you'll get more personal attention from professors at FIT. UCF has bigger and nicer campus since it gets a lot of money from the State of Florida. Orlando also has way more to do than Melbourne but you'll have to deal with way more traffic. UCF is more well known, although, not necessarily because it has great academics. It's more known because it's so large (almost 70,000 students) and it has a division 1 football program.",

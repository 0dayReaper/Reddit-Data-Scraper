    "postText": "I'm preparing to apply to Florida Tech's M.S. in Computer Information Systems, which I'll be attending as an online student if I get accepted to the program and decide to go for it. I haven't been able to find much in the way of reviews from students who have attended or are attending the program, so I was just wondering if anyone here had any experience being a student in the program. In addition to FL Tech's program, I'm also applying to the University of West GA's Masters in Applied Computer Science program and am trying to figure out which one would be a better choice to attend.",

That\u2019s not the best source of information. \n\nI\u2019m currently in my first semester of the FIT Virtual MSCIS. Keep in mind that\u2019s through the Virtual portal, not the Online portal. Apparently, those are two separate schools. I picked Virtual because I\u2019m Active Duty and so it\u2019s heavily discounted for me. Online was not.\n\nThe first course I chose was CIS 5100. I forget the actual course name but it\u2019s intro to Java development. The next course I\u2019ll take will probably be Discrete Mathematics. They told me that\u2019s a degree requirement that I\u2019ll likely need. When I heard that, I was pretty happy because I was looking for a more technical degree program, one that\u2019s as close to CS as possible. I didn\u2019t choose CS because I don\u2019t have any of the prereqs. I figured this was the next best thing.\n\nThe course I\u2019m in is what I hear other CS courses are: the professor reads through the textbook chapter for us. I don\u2019t even attend the lectures because he just goes through the chapter; I prefer to read it on my own. I saw at least one other class required you attend and show your face in video. I\u2019ve never had to video record myself or even talk to anyone (but remember, I\u2019m taking my first class of my first semester).\n\nThe course I\u2019ll take after that is CIS 5200, advanced programming \u2014 also in Java. I figure that will require some extra math, which is why I\u2019m taking the math class first.\n\nThen I\u2019ll be taking the systems and database classes. It seems like a legit curriculum \u2014 technical, like I wanted. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll get the foundational knowledge I\u2019d like, such as a BSCS would give me, but since this was the closest thing I could get for the cost, I decided to go with this. Might end up going to WGU for a streamlined BSCS after my military contract is up; honestly not sure.\n\nIf you have questions let me know.",

                            "comment": "Hi.\n\nSo, FIT Online doesn't appear to have a MSCIS. They do have the bachelors and a MS in  IT, however. I'm not sure how similar to my program the MSIT is. Here's the degree page for the MSCIS\n\n[https://catalog.fit.edu/preview\\_program.php?catoid=9&amp;poid=3263](https://catalog.fit.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=9&amp;poid=3263)\n\nI honestly don't know the difference between FITV and FIT Online. The degrees they offer might be different, as the cost for me being Active Duty was different (meaning, this degree is literally free for me, whereas FITOnline was barely discounted). I know that the Virtual program is one of the Education Centers, while Online is not. You can see them both here:\n\n[https://www.fit.edu/graduate-admissions/](https://www.fit.edu/graduate-admissions/)\n\nSo far, CIS 5100 has been good at teaching me the basics of Java programming. I mean, I just read the textbook; the professor hasn't taught me anything (I've heard it's the same way at brick and mortar schools, too). The workload isn't too much. There have been days I've studied / worked for 12 hours, but it's not normally like that. You'll pretty much become as good as the time you spend studying.\n\nAs for the math, you need some high-level math from your undergrad. I took psychological statistics years ago, but they suggested I take discrete math because it's \"foundational to computing,\" as they said, which I understand. I think it was more of a suggestion since I already took stats, but I'm going along with it because it fulfills one of my electives, anyways.\n\nI'm taking one course at a time, since I work full time. At this rate I should finish the program at about 2.5 years total. I don't know about the job prospects, but one thing you always hear about tech work is that the degree doesn't matter so much other than to check a box; it's really about the work you can do. So, like I said, however much you put in is how much you'll get out of it.",

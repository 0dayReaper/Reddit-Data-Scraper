    "postText": "Hey guys! I am a high school senior planning to study marine bio somewhere. I have been accepted to FIT and I am trying to make a decision whether I should go to FIT, or keep looking. Any firsthand info about FIT will be appreciated, especially anything about the Marine Bio program. What internships are available? Does the school/program have a good reputation? Any info appreciated, thanks.",

            "comment": "Hey I am not marine bio but my best friend is. She currently works for the Smithsonian down in Fort Pierce. Another friend works for New York State as a marine biologist I believe.  \n\nI think you\u2019ll find our Marine Bio professors are some the best, caring, and invested professors. FIT takes a big hands on approach as well which is great because you\u2019ll get field experience. You\u2019ll most likely be with the same group of people during your four years so you\u2019ll really make some great connections and have people to rely on for anything during your time there.\n\nAs for internships they aren\u2019t too bad as you\u2019re in a great location for it and lots of universities in the state doing research since they have the $$$.\n\nLet me now if there is anything more specific you want to know. I can ask a few people and PM you their answers :)",

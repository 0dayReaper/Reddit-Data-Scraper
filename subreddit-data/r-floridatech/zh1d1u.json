THROW JAMIE UNDER THE BUS. It costs you nothing.",

Know that I am not going out of my way to delete your posts, but you need to maintain some minimum level of respect for both students and employees to be allowed to post here. You can make your point without resorting to ad hominem attacks like your post you made 2 months ago. Take care and best of luck.",

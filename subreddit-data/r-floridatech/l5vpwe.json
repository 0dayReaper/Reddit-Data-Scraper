    "postText": "I got accepted to Florida Tech earlier this afternoon, I was pretty excited because I was expecting this to be the one school I wasn't able to get into. My grades are pretty good, but I'm coming as a transfer student into an Astrophysics field with little to no math classes taken at the college level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been in upstate New York for a majority of my life, but I really need to get the hell out of here. I kind of just want to ask some general questions, and maybe get some responses? I've read a lot of negative things about FIT, but I'd like to hear from some people directly about their time there if possible? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Are the professors good in the physics/astronomy/math department? Are they around if you need help with classwork/homework? Or are you on your own? Also, how approachable are most of the professors? \n2. Is crime a big deal around campus? Or would you say it's overall safe?\n3. Is it easy to get involved in research? \n4. Honestly how bad is COVID there? (Sorry if this one is kind of ignorant) \n5. Last one, is there a lot of racism/sexism in the student body? This might be another strange question, but I just don't want to feel singled out, I've heard that STEM fields can have some of this more than others... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "So this is a slow sub, give it time for responses.\n\nI think the professors are overall very good. They have had some interesting backgrounds, which I find sometimes shows in their classes. I didn't find any of my classes to be super difficult, but I did learn something from them. You could look into auditing a few courses to get an idea.\n\nGenerally speaking, the professors will be very helpful, but the time it takes to get that help can vary. Sometimes they are busy, but I haven't run into any walls getting the help I needed in time. \n\nCan't speak for crime, I enrolled in online courses due to travel difficulties. The campus has armed security officers which I've seen wandering around and checking on things. I felt safe, and they were friendly and helpful when I was looking to visit specific places on campus. They also have a cat, which is nice.\n\nI'm not yet at that level,  but I have heard that we are very active in regards to research. If I recall correctly we are something like the top 2% in terms of activity. If you look at the school newsletter they occasionally talk about ongoing research, which could give you an idea of who to talk to and about what.\n\nI have heard a lot of complaining that classes weren't forced online early in the 2020 year. No idea as to how they are handling covid now. In my experience, if you hear complaining about something on campus there is usually a grain of truth to it. \n\nI find the students to be very accepting and diverse from a thinking standpoint, but you know there is always that *one* person. Haven't run into any bigots though, fingers crossed. We have a Spectrum club and a couple of other LGBT related things if that's your speed. We are pretty diverse in terms of nationality, lots of foreign students doing cool work. I don't think you'd feel like an outcast if that is a concern.\n\nIn my personal opinion, I'm glad I chose FiT. I too noticed a lot of reviews online complained about the professors, or with difficulty they had with the online courses. While I was initially worried I can't say I am in the same boat as them opinion-wise. We use Canvas LMS like many other schools, and outside of Safari being dumb, I haven't had any technical roadblocks. I'd be interested to hear what your experiences are as you go through the process.",

            "comment": "1. Unfortunately physics is one of the worst departments in the school for professors, at least at a low level. If you get a good prof, they're great. If not... You may be on your own. I haven't had any math or physics classes since Covid so I can't speak for availability but in my experience, they were always happy to see students during office hours. Most of the time they didn't have visitors. I was struggling in Calc 2 and ended up going to my professor's office at least twice a week. Dr. Knoll dragged me through that class and while I still did poorly, I passed. \n\n2. Crime generally isn't too bad. Certainly not a place to leave your stuff unlocked but nothing violent either. \n\n3. Talk to professors. Most people are just there to get a degree and leave. I had a job in my department preparing figures and formatting a paper for publication (hopefully soon!) \n\n4. I think our highest week so far for positivity was around 20 people, most weeks it's under a dozen though. See this for the data: https://www.fit.edu/coronavirus/covid-19-dashboard/\n\n5. I haven't noticed any outright racism, but sexism is definitely a thing. It's like 75% male (or more depending on major) so maybe that contributes? I'm a guy but have talked to a couple girls who say they've experienced it in grading. We have a huge international population and I think there's an organization for just about everyone to celebrate their culture, if that's something you're interested in.",

Florida Tech had a 33% international population while I was there with a lot of Middle Eastern and Caribbean students. I would say there was less than average on the racism side. Women were underrepresented in many of the engineering fields at the time. I personally did not see people talking down to women, but it undoubtedly happened. Women in the OE department who wanted to do shipboard duty for the ocean survey type work (which represented a decent number of the jobs) were explicitly forewarned to expect sexism on the boats and that they would have to prove themselves.",

It's straight up House of Cards in the higher administration levels and that can drastically affect the students. \n\nSo far this year, they have refused to issue refunds, sent an all male maintainance crew to my dorm without notice (while my girlfriend was alone in the shower) and didn't have the courtesy to respond to my complaints, crippled the campus WiFi during online classes, gave me a new roommate without notice and while I wasn't home over break, moved up the class withdrawal date so they didn't have to issue refunds to students, and the also take *a lot* of money from research grants that disappear without any trace. Also, keep a close eye on your tuition fees. They get creative and sometimes apply and extra thousand dollars to cost for no fucking reason. When you call them on it, they say it's \"a simple clerical error.\" - BS\n\nTl;dr expect good professors, decent student life, but campus administration using every chance possible to take advantage of you.",

            "comment": "Congratulations on your acceptance! And condolences for the year you have to start. This pandemic situation isn't doing the school any favors.  \n1) The professors are very hit or miss, but luckily they're all quite predictable. This might not be unique to Florida Tech but passing classes is half learning the material and half learning the professor. And since it's such a small university, you can always find somebody who's taken their class and can point you in the right direction.  \n2) You'll never feel unsafe on campus, there's always a security guard or a emergency station nearby. As long as you lock your bike to a bike rack you won't have an interaction with The Crime once.  \n3) As long as you take the initiative to ask professors and GSAs, there's always an opportunity to get involved with. I'd suggest joining clubs with upperclassmen and asking them, the most talented people are always the busiest.  \n4) COVID will be a danger wherever you go. And unfortunately the athletics department and the President specifically are pretty terrible with saying one thing and doing another. As long as you take the proper personal precautions, you shouldn't be at any more risk than anywhere else.  \n5) I hate to be another cis white guy here, but... I haven't noticed a systemic issue with sexism at Florida Tech, but I haven't noticed any meaningful improvements (relative to everywhere else) either. The school is currently sitting at 29% female, which is slightly better than 3 guys to every girl. But such a small campus makes it easier to see the students as individuals instead of demographics (I'm sure that doesn't make sense, sorry).\nRegarding racism, I came to the university because it was so diverse, especially with international students. It's exceeded my expectations, and I've met some of the most interesting people. Before COVID it felt like there was a cultural event every week, and the larger events attracted people from all over the city. Regardless of who you are, there will be people who look like you and think like you (though maybe not both) and your group WILL find you. In a totally non-threatening way.",

            "comment": "Went to FIT for my freshman year (until i got sent home in march because of COVID) but I transferred this past summer &amp; am currently a sophomore at another school so maybe I can help.\n\n1. I was an Astrobio major, and hated almost every single one of my professors, IMO they showed clear favoritism among students and didn\u2019t really help as far as in terms of struggling students. Some are diamonds in the rough like Professor Knoll in Math, but tbh most of them were the reason why I fell out of love with Physics. I had almost no relationship with any of my professors and I am an extremely outgoing social guy, I\u2019m friends with nearly everyone I meet... not at Florida Tech though.\n\n2. Campus is really safe, its in a really bad area though so I never liked leaving campus especially without a car. Theres some sketch people out at night though sometimes.\n\n3. I honestly don\u2019t know about this one, I never was involved in research but they were never really actively advertising it either, I think its kinda like a type of thing where you have to reach out to professors first.\n\n4. I went to visit some friends a few weeks ago &amp; its not terrible, masks are required in doors but I then again if you\u2019re looking for literally ANY type of social scene I would not recommend FIT at all.... even precovid it was unbearably hard to even find 1 person to hang out with and do things with regularly, campus is very dull and lonely. I would spend most weekends alone watching movies or forcing myself to hang out with people I didn\u2019t like just so I wasn\u2019t alone. \n\n5. Only time I ever experienced homophobia was on Florida Tech campus. I got singled out for being gay nearly weekly, and it almost always was in a negative way. (I wasn\u2019t even that open about being gay at the time and I NEVER talked about it, people were literally just obsessed with me because I was like the 1 gay male freshman). Got told by multiple people I should leave the school because I\u2019m gay, One time I got a 15 on a Calc 2 Quiz and someone said it was because I was \u201cgay and bad at math\u201d, Got told by my randomized roommate that gay people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to adopt kids or get married, had multiple people tell me that I was against their religion, had someone tell me that gay people deserve to be discriminated against and that if its against your religion they should discriminate against gay people, had people tell me I only got into the school for diversity purposes (when literally no where on my application did I ever indicate or say I was gay), had a dick spray painted on my door, had people tell me I\u2019m only funny because \u201call gay people are funny\u201d, one time at a party a guy threatened to kill me &amp; I had to file MANY discrimination reports with the help of my RA. Women are often in the minority and discrimination against, but most of the girls down there are \u201cguys girls\u201d so they usually just take it. Another one of my randomized roommates actually raped a girl I was friends with while drunk and got kicked out so if that doesn\u2019t tell you what you need to know IDK what will. Rapes go unreported by the school and there was protests my year against the Deans outside their office for covering like 18(?) rapes in a year (# could be wrong). Just imagine some loser conservative kid from your high school that gave off school shooter vibes and had anger issues &amp; all the pick-me girls, yea well at FIT they are the \u201cpopular\u201d people and think theyre hot shit when they\u2019re all basically terrible people. There are some diamonds in the rough though, but its really hard to come across genuinely nice people. Most of the RAs were amazing people so I spent most of my time with them as a freshman. But theres not a lot of American POC at the school (theres a lot of international students though), almost nobody from the LGBTQ+ community (especially not gay men). It\u2019s VERY stereotypically STEM school, going into it I was optimistic and didn\u2019t think it would be a lot of \u201cstereotypical STEM kids\u201d but boy was I wrong, it was worse than anything I could ever imagine. &amp; even the \u201cregular\u201d people were probably some of the most immature people I have ever met. It got to the point where I quite literally had nobody I ever wanted to hang out with, so I would just never go to the dining hall or go out to eat, which eventually was the reason for me developing an ED that I\u2019m still struggling with to this day. \n\nOverall it was a terrible experience for me, even when I went back to finally get my things a few weeks ago I had an anxiety attack just being on campus (and I don\u2019t have anxiety and almost never have anxiety attacks), I have PTSD from my time there and it made me fall out of love with science and my dream of being an astronaut. I definitely was not strong enough to handle that school for even 1 semester, everybody is different though as I especially thrive in social environments.\n\nBut sometimes its the right fit, my twin brother actually goes to FIT too (we aren\u2019t close so we didn\u2019t really spend time together) and he absolutely loves it. But for me it was probably the worst 7 months of my life, and had I not gotten sent home because of COVID I 100% without a doubt would have dropped out to leave that campus.",

I am a software engineering major, and both of the Calc professors I've had so far have been wonderful. Professor Knoll (rest her soul) and Jones are very passionate and knowledgeable about their subjects. The classes are hard, but most professors are more than willing to help. Every single professor I have emailed so far has gotten back to me within an hour or two, and they seem to be happy to answer my questions. Honestly just apply for your classes as early as possible and look at their ratings on RateMyProfessor. As you can guess, the classes that book early have the better professors, and having good professors at shitty times is better than having shitty professors at good times. If you have to get up early to have a good professor, do it. It won't only save your GPA but also your sanity.\n\n2. The area around Florida Tech is honestly kinda shitty. If you go forward from the school it's one of the lower-income parts of town, which unfortunately correlates to crime. I have heard of shootings in that area, but campus seems to be far enough away.\n\n3. Don't know, honestly.\n\n4. COVID lockdown restrictions are very lenient, compared to other states, as far as I have heard. The main thing is to wear a mask on campus. Since every professor currently is offering Zoom meetings for their classes, most classes are near - if not - empty. My COM1102 class has nobody physically there, so my professor has stopped showing to class and just lectures through Zoom.\n\n5. I'm white, and I haven't been on campus very much, but there is a lot of diversity at Florida Tech, and I haven't experienced any racism at all. I'm not quite sure about sexism, I haven't seen or experienced any with my professors, but there are a lot of international students, and I'm sure it is common in some cultures. There are significantly more males than females on campus, since STEM is a male-dominated industry currently\n\nAfterthoughts: The campus isn't too large, and the cafeteria food is very good compared to other college cafeterias. Altogether, I really enjoy Florida Tech.",

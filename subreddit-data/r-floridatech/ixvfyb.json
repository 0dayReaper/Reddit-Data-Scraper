Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.\n\n* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.\n* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.\n* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.\n* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students\u2019 point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today\u2019s day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  \n\n   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.\n\nThe survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.\n\nSurvey Link (works on mobile phones): [https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_exovHBk7UZMtTFP](https://clemson.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_exovHBk7UZMtTFP)",

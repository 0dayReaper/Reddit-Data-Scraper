    "postText": "Hiya!! I'm going to be an up and coming transfer to FIT in 2023/2024! \nI'm a non-tradition student (im 25 and returning to college) and I'm taking online classes as my current university so boost my gpa and get some basics out of the way after being out for 7-8 years. \n\nI've already spoken to an admissions councelor about the classes I need to focus on for astro - based majors so I'm familiar with what I need to take to prepare to be there. \nMy main question is what sort of GPA do I need to aim for in order to be acceptedand things go smoothly? I was hesitant to ask because my gpa isn't bad but I didn't want to come off as pandering or anything. I want to make sure that I can maintain my GPA between my current and then to FIT and adjust any habits of mine \ud83d\ude0a\n\nHow is campus life? Is there a lot of organizations that are active throughout the semester? Is greek life relevant? \n\nThank you guys for any information \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

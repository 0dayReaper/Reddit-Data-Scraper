    "postText": "I\u2019m a highschool senior and I\u2019m interested in astrobiology. I saw on their site that FIT offers a B.S. degree for Astrobiology? How are the courses? professors? research? resources?\n\n Also, (just a tangent sorry)\nI visited FIT during summer break and spoke to a staff member/professor about their astronomy program. (I wasn\u2019t aware that they offered astrobiology at the time) ...he recommended that I took a physics class while still in high school. Unfortunately, my school doesn\u2019t have any physics classes. (Which sucks) So, will not taking any physics classes in highschool hinder my learning when I start studying physics at a  university level? Any advice? \n\nI also plan on doing one (or two) years in a community college (due to personal/family reasons) and then transfer to FIT. Will that lower my chances of getting accepted? This link gives me hope haha. \u2014&gt; https://www.fit.edu/transfer-admissions/special-transfer-programs-and-opportunities/florida-college-connection-program/\n\nThank you for your time.

A good portion of your coursework in Astrobio will be physics-based.\n\nDoing a year or two in community college won't hurt your chances of getting in.  I would actually recommend doing that, as it will save you and your family a lot of money, and it will give you an opportunity to test the waters of physics and mathematics.  Consider trying to complete your Physics 1 and Physics 2 courses, along with the first couple of Calculus courses, in community college.\n\nAnother thing I can say is that we are in the process of hiring a new Astrobiology professor (my advisor Dr. Sam Durrance, former astronaut, is likely retiring in the next year or two.  He is currently looked upon as as the main astrobiology guy in the department).  So, the hiring of someone fresh for astrobiology is an exciting prospect.  Perhaps he or she will come prepared with new research projects for graduates and undergraduates alike.\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions you have about the major, the department, or how best to prepare.",

                            "comment": "&gt; Who are the friendliest/uncooperative professors?\n\nI find the info on the FIT professors on RateMyProfessor to be pretty accurate.  I've had mostly good experience with professors and courses so far.  My two best experiences have been with Dr. Rassoul and Dr. Perez.\n\n&gt;How should I approach a professor to help them with their research?\n\nGreat that you're thinking about this already!  It's as simple as just asking.  Pull up each professor's web page and check out their work.  If you find it interesting, send them an email for more information.  Consider inquiring as to whether or not they have any work or small projects suitable for an undergraduate student.  If you intend to make it to graduate school (and you should!) then aim for doing at least one full year of research at FIT, and more if possible.\n\n&gt;do you know of any past projects the astrobio folks have worked on while you\u2019ve been at FIT?\n\nA few come to mind, although I'm sure there are more going on that I'm not aware of.  There's a large effort at FIT to simulate Martian regolith.  It's a huge, inter-departmental effort (biology, chemistry, space sciences, engineering, etc.).  The intent is to develop a working simulant and study it in the context of optimizing crop growth, eliminating the harmful perchlorates (nasty chemicals we wouldn't want getting into our food), etc.  \n\nAlso, a colleague of mine recently graduated with his PhD from my advisor.  His research involved sending protein samples to the International Space Station and studying their development in microgravity.  The samples flew to the ISS on a Falcon 9.  They received a lot of interesting data that I think can ultimately inform our understanding of Alzheimers disease, actually.  My understanding is that they wish to fly another similar mission in the future.  If that is of interest to you, consider contacting Dr. Xu in the biology / biochem department.\n\n&gt;What made you want to study Space Sciences at FIT? Are you enjoying it?\n\nMy background is in physics, and my main research interests outside of fundamental physics are astrophysical, cosmological, or related to space exploration.  I received two offers from the schools to which I applied for graduate programs.  I chose FIT for the proximity and close working relationship with NASA, in particular.  I am definitely enjoying it here, although there are some aspects that I would change, the Florida summer being the first that comes to mind...\n\n&gt;I really appreciate your reply. ( :\n\nMy pleasure!  I'll be here for at least 3 more years, so if you make it to FIT, stop by and say hello!  My name is Brendan Steffens.\n",

I am really interested in FIT because of the close knit research environment. \n\nIf I could get some inside information from your side it would greatly aid in making a decision.\n\nThanks!",

The tendency for FIT to produce NASA employees is not at all exaggerated; something like 10-15% of NASA employees are FIT alumni.  In fact, this school was literally created to train NASA employees.  Graduate class schedules still reflect this, in that all graduate level classes are in the evenings, which, historically speaking, allowed NASA employees back in the 50s and 60s to complete extra study in their freetime.  Many FIT students score internships/fellowships from NASA during their time here.  \n\nWhether or not FIT would be a better or worse fit for you than UMich (I don't know much about UT Austin) will I think depend on your specific interests and your career plan.  I applied to UMich for graduate school, and if I had gotten in there, I probably would have chosen it, in order to pursue my interests in cosmology and the more theoretical side of space physics.  \n\nSo, why don't you tell me some specifics about your interests and where you see yourself in 10-15 years (do you want to be a NASA employee specifically, working on spacecraft / space observatory missions?  Do you want a more academic role, as a professor perhaps?  Something else?).  I'll try to use your response to provide some more specific advice.",

I didn't attend FIT as an undergraduate, so I can't comment first hand on what the experience is, I can only comment on what I have observed.  Research experience is definitely central to the undergraduate life here, I can say that for certain.  There are large amounts of undergrads contributing in research in observational astronomy, planetary science, astrophysics, and astrobiology.  There are also undergraduate research opportunities in the field of high energy physics as well.  \n\nSo, if undergraduate research opportunities are of concern in your decision (as they should be!) then FIT is definitely worth your consideration.",

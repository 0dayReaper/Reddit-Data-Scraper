    "postText": "I've been accepted to both Florida tech and fiu for computer science. However I'm undecided as to which one to choose since FIU is significantly cheaper but FIT is a smaller and more engineering focussed. Is the CS program at Florida Tech that much better to justify the price?",

Your classes at FIT should be almost half the size of FIU.\n\nIf you ever move off campus, the cost of living is lower in Melbourne than Miami.\n\nThe internship opportunities are probably similar in Melbourne and Miami. Melbourne is a smaller city than Miami, but Melbourne has a lot engineering companies.",

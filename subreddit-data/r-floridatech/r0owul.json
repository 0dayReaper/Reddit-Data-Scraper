I was accepted last month too but my official highschool transcript is required in my finalize application checklist but my school only sends transcripts when they're emailed by the university so I emailed Florida tech and even my admissions counselor asking if they could notify my school but didn't get any reply. Anyone have any ideas? That's the only thing rn that's stopping me from proceeding further.",

    "postText": "I am an incoming student to FIT.\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a campus auction for used items from previous students? \n\nExample, a campus bike auction. Every semester there will be a heap loads of uncollected bicycle on campus.\n\nMaybe even furniture left over from previous graduates.\n\nIf there is a specific website, I can\u2019t seem to find it. \n\nCraig list maybe but I am looking something more campus specific.\n\nThanks for the help.",

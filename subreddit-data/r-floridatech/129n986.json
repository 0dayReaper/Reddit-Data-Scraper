            "comment": "Tbh nobodies really active here, so I\u2019ll give my two cents from what I\u2019ve researched. Florida Tech is cheaper, like half as much as Embry Riddle. If you\u2019ve got deep pockets, you can spring for Embry, but Florida Tech is still a great school for engineering and aerospace subjects. There\u2019s also location. What are the two cities like? Is housing expensive or even good? Etc. Also, what sports and clubs are available? Those are the kinds of things I would be making a list of.",

FIT also pulls in more research funding than ERAU.\n\nERAU is more focused on aviation than FIT.  FIT is only a mile from the Melbourne airport, but ERAU is built next to the Daytona airport, which is an advantage if you're looking to get flight time and flight experience.\n\nFIT seems to be focusing more on space. I think it's a wise move given FITs location and the growing private space industry.\n\nERAU does have more modern and newer buildings than FIT. My guess is ERAU is using money from ERAU Worldwide to build up the Daytona campus.  ERAU Worldwide are the online programs. FIT has online programs too through FIT Online, but ERAU Worldwide has many more students.",

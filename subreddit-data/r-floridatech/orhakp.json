    "postText": "Hello again! I come to you with another question, this one is a bit easier this time.\n\nWhere the heck do I park?? I have tried looking up where I am allowed to park and I have yet to come up with any information. From looking at the maps, there's a lot of parking lots dotted around, but I'm not sure which ones I'm allowed to park at.\n\nOn top of this, where do I park for orientation? I won't have my decal until I actually go to orientation so where do I park?\n\nSo basically my two questions are where do I park for orientation and where do I park for normal class?",

During classes there is a parking garage you can use and there is parking lots all over campus which are almost all open for students. \n\nAlso, here is some tips:\n1.  Try to get a FL FIT license plate. You get your own parking lot which is often not full compared to other lots. Saved me so much time. \n\n2. It is almost impossible to find a spot after 10am. Try to get a spot early in the day or give yourself extra time to get a spot.",

Make sure you get one before it's over and you'll be fine.",

They'll send emails about it as this date approaches. Just get your decal before then and bring the ticket to the security department in the residence quad to have them drop it. They'll probably rough you up a bit, make a few statements about how you won't do it again and Park properly... Yada yada.... But you'll be fine.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m a local Melbourne resident. Considering doing an MBA here. Has anyone done it and can tell me if I should do the online program or the in class program? The online is looking like it is $300 more a credit than taking it in class. This school definitely is not cheap but I figure since I live and work here already that it might be a good option",

            "comment": "AFAIK, the degree online and on campus are identical. No one will know if you attended online or on campus based on the degree. So it comes down to your preference. Do you want the flexibility of online classes or do you learn better in-person?\n\nI took a few online classes before (not at FIT) and I didn't like them. I found it difficult to stay organized and focused when the class was purely online.",

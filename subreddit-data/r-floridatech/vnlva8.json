Turn all of the traditional sports into club sports and go all in on esports by building a legit esports arena and giving scholarships for esports players. Possibly hire coaches for each game. The coaches could work remotely part time.\n\nFIT could also try getting into more obscure sports like ultimate frisbee. Drone racing would be perfect at FIT too.",

I don\u2019t think I would even try it if I were president.\n\nI think it would hurt FIT in academic rankings too (even though it shouldn\u2019t). Even stopping these sports is going to negatively impact the perception of the school. FIT is not alone though. [Many schools](https://hoopdirt.com/the-list-college-athletic-programs-cutting-sports/) have had to cut sports recently. With the looming recession, I expect more universities will eliminate more sports.",

You'll never get a D1 job anywhere that will matter. But you can flop around in D2 or D3 until you drink yourself to death. Choose wisely, chubby.",

You're better off finding the student list when the classes start and trying to engage with the other IT students on the class website.",

I won\u2019t say I put no effort in but I felt I could have done more. At the same time I pulled a 99% and 95%. Maybe the next class will be more, I don\u2019t know to early to tell.",

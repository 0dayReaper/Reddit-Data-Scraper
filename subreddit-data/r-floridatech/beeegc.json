    "postText": "I am starting at FIT in the fall for areospace engineering and I am wondering if I need a powerful computer or not. I currently have a few year old Acer laptop with an I5 and 8gbs of ram along with a bunch of ssd storage. Is this enough to last me through my first couple years or should I look for somthing more powerful?",

For yout major related courses, you'll need Matlab and Creo in your first couple years. Matlab you'll be fine for small to medium size projects, which is all you'll be doing to start. Creo will likely run but it won't be a great experience. \n\nKeep in mind there are also places on campus with the software installed- the third floor of the library and the labs in OEC. All engineering major students can also request swipe access to the building and the computer labs, so you will be able to work in OEC pretty much 24/7.",

You should be able to make a decent determination then. You'll definitely want your own good machine by senior year though- too much stuff to do to always be using other people's computers.",

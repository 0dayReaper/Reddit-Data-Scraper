I'm almost 30, and with my credit being less than favorable, getting enough in student/personal loans seems insurmountable. It's heartbreaking to say the least. Ive pushed my acceptance to a year now.  Even with getting 26 grand in financial aid, and applying to about 30 scholarships, my dreams are dwindling. So just wanna know how does everyone afford this school?",

I did very well, and even won a nice award.  It opened up my eyes and opportunities to be accepted into Florida Tech rather than an overcrowded state university.  I would need to attend full-time in order to get all the financial aid, scholarships, and grants I'm being offered.  But since I would need to move across the state to attend, it's an all or nothing type of thing.  ",

The service I would consider would be the Air Force because I'd like to be a pilot and reach to be an astronaut one day. I know that would be a more direct route to take, but the sacrifices is what I'm pondering at the moment. I really do appreciate the answer though. ",

It made the price identical to going to a public school.\n\nAlso, everyone is guaranteed federal loans no matter how poor their credit is. If federal loans aren't enough to cover your expenses, you should look elsewhere or consider going part-time.\n\nAre you trying to be a full-time student and not work? At 30, I think your chance to be a full-time student might be gone. You should probably be looking at taking classes online or night classes part-time while you work full-time. It will take you longer to graduate, but you won't have to incur debt for day to day living expenses like rent and food.",

When I was at FIT, I worked part-time in the stockroom (Federal Work Study grant), received partial financial aid (Florida Medallion Scholarship), and paid the rest with student loans. Classes were tough, but every professor I had was great and really cared about the students. Great student:professor ratio. \n\n\nLoans do add up, but at the same time, if you're stuck making $40k when you could be making $80k four years from now, then you should join FIT in order to secure a better future for yourself. Furthermore, I am almost positive your credit score means nothing in terms of how much aid you can receive. Speak to the financial aid department if you must. Lastly, take as many classes as you can every semester, FIT will charge you for up to 12 credit hours and after that it's free (unless that's changed). Good luck!",

My issue of financial aid and credit score is that I am receiving 26,000 in financial aid and grants and the tuition closer to 50,000 with living expenses. I need to fund the 24,000 on my own. 12,000 per semester, and personal student loans are the only way for me to raise that kind of money. I'm working on paying down my own debts to get some personal school loans to help me out. I see it as investment in myself rather than just \"debt\", so I am doing everything I can to make it happen. I do have to be realistic though. I have been out of school for almost 2 years now, and I fear if you don't use it, you lose it. I will be starting school somewhere this Fall. I applied to UCF's aerospace engineering program as a backup but I know what I want. ",

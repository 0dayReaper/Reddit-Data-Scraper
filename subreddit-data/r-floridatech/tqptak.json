    "postText": "Wanted to get some input regarding Florida tech's TA/RA positions. I am interested in attending FIT's ABA master's graduate program and currently trying to figure out how to get past the cost. Does Florida Tech offer tuition waivers for TA positions and if so how much? Ik different programs/schools are different regarding salary/tuition reimbursement for TA/RA positions but I wanted to see if anyone can give me an idea to what I'm looking at. I plan on applying for fellowships/ other scholarships as well so I know that is an option but would also like to have other means to cover the cost.",

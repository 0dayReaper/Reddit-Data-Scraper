    "postText": "Recently got accepted into Florida Tech, am starting in the Spring. I took a look at the Spring 2022 orientation schedule and have about two questions if anyone knows the answers to them. I notice it says that all sessions are mandatory - the first orientation mentions the math placement exam. I took that online through the Panther Paws thing - does that matter? Will I still have to retake it in person?\n\nMy second question is, the next orientation day has an event around 2pm they'll have an International Student Orientation - I'm not an international student, so can I just leave the campus and then come back when it's over or do I have to stay on campus and just wait until it's over? Or will they simply make me attend the event even if I'm not an international student?\n\nAnother question looking over the schedule again; what is \"Campus recreation\"?",

In fact, even though it says those sessions are mandated I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re enforced or kept track of in any way. I missed a session or two myself, and I had friends who didn\u2019t go to any of them, and none of us had any consequences from it. But you should still try to make them if you can - there\u2019s a lot of good information to be learned. \n\nI believe \u201cCampus Recreation\u201d is a tour of our gym - Clemente Center - and all the services it provides. Have a great time at FIT!",

The orientation states that it is \u201cMandatory,\u201d but you don\u2019t get any repercussions from not attending, other than missing out on some information. \r  \n\r  \nThey usually have some raffles or lucky draw when you attend. Downloading the Corq and Florida Tech app makes orientation easier. Also, in Corq, you can see your event pass (it\u2019s your QR code). The student body or orientation reps use this to place you in the draw and mark attendance, etc.",

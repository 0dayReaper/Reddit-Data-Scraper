    "postText": "I have been at Florida Tech for 2 years now. In my time here I have noticed that some students receive extra time on tests and final exams. They dont take the exam in the same room as the rest of the students and get double time. I have heard that there is a range of reasons why/how you can get this privilege, from going to CAPS and saying you cant focus during exams because of noise, to some mental health reasons. So with all of this I now ask... Why are we all given the same diploma at the end of our 4 years? If I can complete a task in half the time it takes the guy sitting next to me why are we getting the same degree? I have also talked with friends from other colleges and there are similar programs at most of them. Anyway, I just wanted to throw this out there, maybe people have the same opinion or maybe I gave you somthing to thing about. ",

It's not right to judge based on mental disabilities or anything related, and no one should have to be penalized for something like that. It's out of their control. An employer cares whether or not you're qualified for a task; there's no reason to discriminate.",

There\u2019s no reason to give someone a lesser degree for it, employers already know if you need accommodations before they even hire you. They pick people based on qualification for the job, not based on if they have a disability or not. Having a disability doesn\u2019t make you any more or less qualified than someone else, knowledge (what you know about the job), personality (how you fit in at the company) and skill level (how good you are at the job) is what makes you qualified for jobs.

They don\u2019t just hand them out, you have to have proper documentation. ",

What im taking about is two people who are only taking classes from 17 to 20 credit hours worth. Where one person gets twice as much time on exams as another person. That seems to me like the person who takes the exams and needs  twice as long shouldn't be getting the same gpa or degree. A test in high school or college  is designed so that students have to recall information they were given to study in an allotted amount of time specified by the professor. Students who can't complete the given task in that time shouldn't receive extra time to do so. Or if they do need more time have that reflected in the grade on the test or on their diploma. Give them a little asterisk. *was given 2x time on all exams.\n",

Should your diploma be more valuable or respected if you read your books without any additional aids or assistance?  Should I not be allowed to wear glasses when I take the exam because it improves my vision?\n\nReasonable accommodations are made in an effort to level the playing field for all players, not to give anyone an advantage.  If you have a bona fide medical condition as certified by a licensed medical practitioner, you may qualify for certain reasonable accommodations, too.  \n\nNow, I think this system does have the potential for abuse and is often abused in many schools, not just Florida Tech.  But I wouldn't want to live in a world - or go to a school - that did not insist on equal access for all.  ",

                                    "comment": "Glasses is a perfect counter argument. You wear glasses to assist with your vision impairment, a disability with your eyes. You would have trouble getting your job done without your glasses, so you are allowed to wear them in the workplace to help with your job. You may have bad eyesight but a great attention to detail for your job, however without your glasses the attention to detail would go down because you physically can\u2019t see the detail. With your glasses, the aid that helps you reach your full potential, you can have the best attention to detail in the job. Now take someone with ADHD or Autism, they spent just as much time studying as you did, they spent just as much time in the classroom as you did, but because of the disability they have with their brain, it\u2019s much harder for them to focus than it is for a normal person. This quiet room helps them to focus more like a normal person and the extra time accounts for the time when they are physically incapable of thinking about the test, this allows them to not be penalized for it. Since they don\u2019t make glasses for your brain, they don\u2019t make magic lenses that make your brain able to focus, this is the next best thing. This is how they accommodate brain disorders just as glasses accommodate vision disorders. It is 100% comparable. The problem is that people seem to be more excepting of physical disabilities than mental ones. When people can see evidence that a person can\u2019t control a physical disability they agree, if you can\u2019t control this, we should help fix it for you to the best of our ability (hence glasses for sight, wheelchairs and ramps for mobility, etc.) but with mental disabilities because it\u2019s a disability with our brains, that\u2019s inside of our bodies, outsiders can\u2019t physically see what\u2019s wrong with someone so they are less willing to accept it and less willing to help. The brain is a complex organ just like the eye, and in the same way if your eye doesn\u2019t work right you can\u2019t control it, if your brain doesn\u2019t work right you can\u2019t control that either. It\u2019s a very common stigma and misconception that people can just think their brains better. That\u2019s just not how it works. Sure you can think with your brain but no amount of thinking is going to physically change the structure and chemicals of your brain that cause disabilities. ",

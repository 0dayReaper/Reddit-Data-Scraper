    "postText": "Hello! I was recently accepted to FIT and offered a decent scholarship. Combined with other scholarships, my tuition will be extremely affordable (more so than every other school on my list), and I believe that certain opportunities make FIT my top choice.   \nI have a couple of questions regarding what FIT can offer, and I believe they may be helpful for others as well. (no particular order, answer whatever you can)  \n1. I'm going to do a double major in Physics and Aerospace Engineering, and have a lot of AP credit. If the website says that all of my AP scores transfer to course credit, will I get credit for all of these courses? (rather, will they deny any AP credit). Doing so would allow me to effectively skip almost two semesters worth of coursework, and this is important.   \n2. Does anyone know whether their accelerated master's program is compatible with the double major? (MS Physics and BS Phys + AeroEng)   \n3. Does the Machine and Welding Shop at FIT offer *official certifications* for select machinery? The website mentions having to pass certification, but never says that the certifications are offered at FIT.  \n4. How are the Badminton Club, Esports, and Music Programs?   \n5. How are research opportunities?   \n6. Does a study abroad program (particularly G-MEO Shanghai Summer program) affect the progression of coursework (add to the total amount of years in college)? On a related note, how are the Chinese classes (both language and related HUM classes) at FIT?  \n7.  How much money is awarded through the Music Service Awards, and is this renewable?  \n8. How do other universities view degrees from FIT when applying for a doctoral program? (e.g. Peking University, Nanyang Polytechnic, Caltech)   \n9. What is the average number of students pursuing Physics at FIT for a given year? (I know that this is a low number almost everywhere)  \n\n\nIf you'd like to ask anything about me to clarify or provide insight, feel free :)  \n\n\nI may ask more questions as I think of them.  \n\n\nThanks all! &lt;3",

            "comment": "You should be able to double major and do the accelerated master's program.\n\nld recommend against double majoring though. While having stronger knowledge of physics as an aerospace engineer is great, it's not really going to open any additional doors for you. Double majoring is extra time, cost and stress that's unlikely to payoff in the long run. I'd get a bachelor's in aerospace engineering and master's in physics.\n\nYou can get a master's in physics without having a bachelor's in physics, but master's in aerospace engineering programs require a bachelor's in engineering.\n\nIf you plan on applying for a PhD one day, I would recommend looking at those schools websites. Usually schools post profiles about their PhD students. Take a look at where the current PhD students graduated from.",

    "postText": "Hiya! I\u2019m a sophomore currently doing a double major in astronomy and physics at Stony Brook University in New York. Getting out of high school I really wanted to go to FIT because I heard their astro program was really good and it\u2019s right by the Kennedy space center. However, I couldn\u2019t afford it. As much as I like the university I\u2019m attending at right now, I was wondering if it\u2019s worth transferring for my last two years, I heard FIT has so many opportunities for astro majors being that the program says on their website that they have a close relationship with NASA but I don\u2019t know how true that is or if it\u2019s worth transferring due to the cost.",

I made lifelong friends and being on the space coast was a huge benefit to my extracurricular happiness, but I likely could have gotten a similar education for much much much much much much much cheaper. If I could warn myself I\u2019d say \u201cdo it all the same except read the Mr. Money Mustache blog right after high school to learn about finances\u201d.",

I ultimately didn't necessarily have the option to make use of all of them (I'm an international student), but I did a lot of research within the school and found a research field I'm extremely passionate about and it motivated me to get a Ph.D. in it (not at Fl Tech unfortunately) :\\]\n\nIf you have any questions hit me up!\n\nAlso I would definitely consider what research interests you or what you see yourself trying out. There is some really awesome stuff in astro research you can do, some more developed than other.\n\nFair warning,  there were some changes in the department so there may be a difference in opinions when it comes to its current state, but I definitely do not have any regrets. Regarding opportunities - some folk I know worked at KSC, some went to Fermilab (for internships), many took up really neat REUs and other NASA internships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I know my response ran a little late but I hope you still want to know",

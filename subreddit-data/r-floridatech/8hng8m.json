    "postText": "Hey all, so I messed up.\n\nI wasn't aware that you could only cancel your housing application 5 days after submitting it. So I submitted them early, hoping for the best housing and such. Also because I wasn't sure if my friends and I were going to be able to get a rental property off campus.\n\nRental property came through. I email housing about canceling and they say no. I talk to the person above the person on the phone, Greg Graham.\n\nAnd he, paraphrasing, says they are landlords and do not care. Gets up and opens the door for me to leave before I can process what he's said or reply. I then finally get out of my mouth that my roommates depend on me for rent. I can't just leave them and in a way they depend on me as they need a home. Greg says this doesn't count as a dependence and doesn't allow me to get out of the lease with the school.\n\nNow, obviously I get that. But they are saying, more or less, that they'd rather keep me in a lease and get my money then care about the well being of two other students.\n\nHas anyone had any experience like this? Greg said I was shit out of luck and had to pay rent for summer and fall housing. Even though I'm already renting off campus.\n\nAny other avenues I can go down to get put of this? I'm already grasping at straws here.",

And I mean someone who doesn't have housing at all.   \nIf not go bother him again and again.    \nGo talk and befriend, and idk if this is the same way, any of the student workers. They know ways to get around things. There's always a way.",

Sorry to say you're effectively SOL.\n\nMy only advice would be to try and transfer to the cheapest possible dorm on campus or to sublet your apartment.",

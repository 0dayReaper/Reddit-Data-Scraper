I get a healthy amount off my tuition based on academics, robotics, eagle scout, etc. Get on the phone with the aid office and as long as you keep pestering them they will get you set up as best they can",

The major in general is very good and hasn\u2019t stopped me from getting and internship and job.  As for financial aid, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to talk with the office about, since it varies, i have bright futures mixed with some scholarships and a decent loan.  If you put your mind to it, it can be worthwhile.",

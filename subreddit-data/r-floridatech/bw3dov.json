    "postText": "Been trying to get the Colombia Villages, but my parents did not want me to do it without them, check today and find out it's been all taken(after they said they were finally ready to select housing).\n\nI've got two questions leading off of that.\n\n1)Do housing options in other halls(a la Colombia Village) have any chance of opening up that I should look for or should I just resign my fate?\n2)Are the options(onl Evans) the only options available for housing? I assume this is the case, but want to make sure since I know the Star of Sea is off campus.\n\nThanks for the answers in advance!",

Also Star of the Sea is off campus but literally across the street (similar to Southgate.) The admissions/admin building is down the block.\n\nLastly a minor/major detail depending who you ask, it\u2019s Columbia Village to remember the space shuttle and the seven fallen astronauts.",

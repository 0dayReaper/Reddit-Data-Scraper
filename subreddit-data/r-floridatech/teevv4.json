    "postText": "Hi All,\n\nRecently accepted an offer for a PhD at FIT. Currently planning to get an apartment (either 1 bed or studio for the first year). Curious what current or past grad students have done in terms of non-dorm living, since there\u2019s not much on zillow or apartments.com yet for August move-in. Thanks for any info!",

Im not sure what areas you are looking in, but we found it tough as well to find places when we moved last December.\n\nPalm Bay, Titusville, and Rockledge seemed to be the only areas we could find anything fitting. \n\nGood luck, we had to make an offer the same day the listing for our current place hit the market. Best advice is to get everything you need for an application ready and be prepared to submit an application the moment something comes on the market.",

The traffic in Melbourne isn't bad except around 8 am and 5pm.\n\nI lived in The Vinings south of campus. It looks like it's called The Braxton now. I could make it to campus in 5 minutes if I got all green lights. It was expensive, but I had no complaints.\n\nThere is an apartment complex directly across the street from campus that constantly changes names. It looks like it's called Palmview Cove. I would avoid staying there. Everyone I knew who lived there did not like it.",

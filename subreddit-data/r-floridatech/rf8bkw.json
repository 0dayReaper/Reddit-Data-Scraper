Tuition is pretty expensive, so I'm hoping to someone can talk about their experiences in the program and intern/research opportunities they've been able to get through the program. Anything worth mentioning in general is welcome!",

I don't know anyone in our program but know someone who went through their regular Psych program and enjoyed it. My girlfriend and a lot of her friends went to FIT and really enjoyed their time there, so I'm hoping I can do the same.\n\n\n I'm going in as a transfer student who already has all their general education classes out of the way and will not be accruing as much debt as someone starting at FIT as a freshman. It is a VERY expensive school but it gives you a pretty good education from everything I have gathered. I have spoken to a lot of people who graduated from there and they are very pleased with their education. I went to EFSC to get my gen Ed classes taken care of.",

    "postText": "Hello!  I recently got accepted into FIT (From Pennsylvania) and they paid off a hefty amount of my tuition so I'm most likely going to apply.  I know I want to go into engineering but not sure what specific field just yet, so could you guys mention some of the engineering majors you're taking and what you do in said majors?  Also what should I expect from life at FIT?  thanks!",

            "comment": "Mechanical engineering student here. This is definitely the broadest of the engineering disciplines. If you're unsure what you want to do as an engineer, a degree in mechanical engineering will get you far. You could do design, testing, prototyping, production, research, there really are no limits. I personally want to work with drones and UAVs so I'm as\u00ed getting a minor in unmanned aerial systems. The classes your first year or two will be pretty similar no matter which flavor of engineering you want, so if you decide to switch it's not a big deal. Don't hesitate to reach out with more questions. ",

Been around most of the engineering departments and my reccomndation would be to cast a wide net early on and get a good feel for the different subject matter over the first year or two. You can easily hop into two or three completely unrelated intro courses and get a feeling for the subject before deciding if you like it or not (talk to your advisor about this) Approx 80% of students change their major before they graduate so don't feel like you have to know exactly what you want to do your freshmen year. Focus on experience, getting to know people, extracurriculars, and subject matter that interests you most. Congratulations on your acceptance, best of luck!",

You get exposed to all of the engineering options FIT offers during your freshman year so you can choose what you liked the best.\n\nAs far as what FIT is like, it's a beautiful campus with a productive and supportive environment. There's a lot to do on and off campus and all around, it's a great experience :) ",

They're working on getting FIRST back together, I can't say for certain about VEX, and there's smaller organizations (like the lunar one) too. I believe there is also a general robotics club that just started, unassociated with a specific organization.\n\n\n\nWe have a few other Engineering based clubs and honors societies that aren't specifically robotics (like ACM and IEEE) if you're interested in that too.",

            "comment": "Graduated in 2010. Just off the cuff: I still have quite a bit of debt that I'm working through but a high-paying engineering job with which to pay it. I transferred from a community college where I completed most of my electives so I was able to complete the program in 3 years but it was 3 years of all technical classes back to back, and sometimes the schedule was odd, as some classes are only offered once/year. If I could do it again, I would not have taken Modern Physics as my science elective, I would have gone with one of the Astronomy courses (physics is work, astronomy is fun work). For your own sake, read the chapter before and after the class lecture, all this reading will pay off. Go to your professor's office hours, ask questions. My extra-curriculars (clubs, flight training) took up a lot of my extra time so it was important to have a ritual of relaxing both on the beach once/week and at the gym 3x/week. Don't underestimate the stress-relieving benefits of exercise. And something I learned much later in life: calories don't make you fat, carbs make you fat. So load up on chicken, beef, and veggies. Try to hang around the aerospace lab, lots of cool work is going on in there and sometimes they need your help (you'll work for free with no recognition but you'll love it). Congrats on your acceptance!\n\nedit: spelling",

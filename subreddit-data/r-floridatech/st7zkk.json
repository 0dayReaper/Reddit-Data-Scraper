If I'm interpreting University of Miami's website correctly, only 3 out of 51 of their board members are alumni.\n\nIt's good to have some outsiders, but I think the majority of board members should be alumni and have a vested interest in the schools success.",

Whatever happened to that?\n\nI assume the lack of communication about the shooting on December 3 was due to incompetence, not malicious intent. I'm guessing it's someone's job in the security office to determine if a situation requires alerting the students. Whoever was supposed to make that decision either thought the situation wasn't dangerous or forgot. Neither is good.\n\nIn defense whoever failed to send out an alert, they have to be careful when they send out alerts about danger on campus. If they send too many alerts, people will ignore them. It has to be used only during a major emergency.",

I guess my question would be what would I need as prerequisites to be eligible to be in the astronomy and astrophysics program? I just finished level 1 physics and next term I am taking the final frontier. I currently have a 3.71 GPA. do you think there would be any difficulty in me transferring from online to on campus?   ",

It's good that you've already taken Physics 1 as well.  Just to be clear, was that Calculus-based Physics 1?  How much mathematics have you studied?",

No, it was not calc. based, more of an introductory physics, unfortunately they don't offer any \"real\" math classes online. As of now, the highest math I have completed is trig and that was in HS. But,  I called and asked if I could do a study request to take some higher level math courses at a college near me. and I do believe I will be able to if I have to have them before i go to campus. do you think I would need them before I transfer? I have a decent understanding of the basics i enjoy reading Hawking books and Kaku books (I'm actually reading Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku right now as we are talking lol) but I want to understand the details better. I am prepared to go back for grad school after finish my bachelors degree.   ",

If you can somehow knock out at least Calculus 1 at a community college or something this year, that will make you not only a much more attractive transfer student, but it will give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to scheduling courses once you're transferred.  It will also give you the opportunity to potentially realize \"Turns out this stuff isn't for me.\"  Obviously, I hope that won't be the case, but many underestimate the skill in maths/physics required to study astronomy/astrophysics, especially if you plan to go onto to graduate school (which you should).  Studying Calculus should be a good indication of whether or not you're making the correct decision. \n\nLet me know if you have any more questions, or need any advice on this topic in the future.  Best of luck!",

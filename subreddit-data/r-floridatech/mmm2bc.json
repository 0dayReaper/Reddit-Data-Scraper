My experience with physics 2 with him is that I had to read the book and practice quite a bit to do well on the weekly quizzes. The quizzes usually weren't that challenging though (maybe medium difficulty), and mostly like the homeworks. The tests of course tended to be more difficult, but not impossible if you read, understood, and reviewed the chapters in the book. \n\nIf you get stuck, going to his office hours is very helpful.\n\nHe is a very thorough professor though, so we should learn a lot for sure.",

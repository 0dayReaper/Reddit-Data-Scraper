            "comment": "I honestly have no clue what your chances are in terms of those scores. Having a 1200+ SAT score is average for students that were accepted. Florida Tech has a large amount of international students so I doubt being from India affects your chances. I am unaware if the cricket club is active, and we do not have a team. But, I have seen groups playing cricket, so you should be able to play cricket as long as you make friends who also want to play.",

How high above 1200 is your SAT (some range would help) and what major were you looking at?\n\n(I was BS'17 and MS'18 at FIT, now at UPenn)",

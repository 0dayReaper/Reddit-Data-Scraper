Looking at the cost per \"oral instruction,\" FIT charges $70 per hour and Embry charges $69 per hour. So I'm guessing the other costs are similar as well.",

Being a resident of Melbourne might be one of the exceptions.\n\nI lived off campus when I was an undergrad at a different university. Honestly, I wish now I lived on campus for at least one year. It seems like it would have been more fun than living off campus.  Now that I graduated, it's an experience I'll never be able to have unless I want to be a weird old guy living in a dorm room.",

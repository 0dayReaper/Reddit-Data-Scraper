I would like to know about the clubs, the experiences, things to do after school, the engineering major and how the classes are, how have you enjoyed the school as a whole so far and any tips or helpful comments that will help me as a student in regards to housing, food, ec activities, etc...",

            "comment": "I'm a current mechanical engineering student here. The school is what you make of it. Social life is kinda dull unless you put yourself out there and get involved. There is a club fair at the start of each semester, I'd really suggest going. If you like sports there are tons of club teams and competitive teams. The biggest piece of advice I can give you is to get involved in something early on. The best thing you can do for post-college is finding internships throughout your time there. We have a career fair every semester and it's a great way to find internships and meet local companies. If you have more specific questions don't hesitate to ask.",

The one right across the bridge is usually pretty crowded, head 20 minutes south if you don't like the crowds. I'm not a fan of the sand though, so I don't go often. I usually go with friends every couple months.",

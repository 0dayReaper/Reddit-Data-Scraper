    "postText": " Hey i just got my admit to Aerospace engineering graduate program at FIT. I have a few doubts and I apologize If I sound absurd as I am unfamiliar with how FIT functions. My doubts are as follows: \n\n1. How do I know what I am majoring in? As in, I only got my syllabus mailed from FIT and the subject I will be focusing on for know is CFD ......so I am guessing I will be majoring in that ...right?\n2. Should I go through any specific topics in aerospace engineering that I should know of? I have completed my undergrads in mechanical engineering so I am kinda confused whether I will feel there's a vast difference between the two courses.\n3. Can someone pls name a few places where I can go and relax during the weekends?",

            "comment": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are fundamentally similar, the applications are different but if you did well in undergrad and understood what you were doing, you should be fine for your master's. If they gave you a list of deficiencies, you will have to take some undergraduate coursework to make up the difference, but if they didn't then they think you are sufficiently prepared.\n\nIn the masters program you will be expected to work more independently than you probably did in undergrad - you may get an assignment where you have to figure out or look up the procedure. For example, you may need to use matlab or some other software to do an assignment and you won't be taught how to use matlab. If you have no programming experience, this summer might be a good time to get some.  \n\nGood luck!",

(You are not assigned an advisor, you have to choose each other - this is especially important if you are doing a thesis). \n\nI am assuming you are not local. I would advise setting up this kind of thing during orientation week, don't try to do it in the summer as a lot of the profs are not on campus a lot of the time in the summer.",

    "postText": "Hey guys! I was accepted into FIT and would really like to know more about the type of funding that graduate students get. Do the assistantships help in paying for a good part of your tuition? How are you for paying graduate school? Are you using loans, scholarships, etc? I would really like to go here for the Master's program in ABA ad OBM, but am a bit worried about the sticker price seen on the website. \n\nAny other information or advice is welcome! Thank you!",

Then I got an RA position in my second year when one of my professors saw I had some experience making phone apps.\n\nMy RA position didn't cover all of my tuition either, but it was worth more than the scholarship and I could list it as work experience on my resume.\n\nI was not in the ABA program though so I'm not sure how difficult it would be for you to become an RA or TA.",

There are sites all over the country at various military installations- including Kennedy Space Center. Not associated much with main campus at all. I tried to take a hybrid class that's KSC/online and that was like pulling teeth. Nobody on campus even knew anything about it since it was for the space systems masters program. \nBest I can tell, aside from River's edge, the other campuses are a single building or even a few rooms in a larger building. Just a couple people on payroll. \nRiver's edge is now being sold, according to a recent update email.",

            "comment": "FIT does not have off site campuses. They have a classroom in Titusville and a classroom in Orlando. They only offer master\u2019s degrees in these locations.\n\nFIT has classrooms on a some military bases too. They mostly only teach master\u2019s classes. The only BS they offer is Logistics Management.\n\nThe degrees they offer at these locations are different than the main campus. Logistics Management is not taught in Melbourne.\n\nMost students in Melbourne aren\u2019t aware of the off site classrooms because there are not many students outside of Melbourne, and the degree programs are different than Melbourne. Most of the students in Melbourne are earning a bachelor\u2019s degree and most off campus are earning master\u2019s degrees. They have no reason to interact.\n\nI went to a banquet once at FIT and someone who earned their degree at an off site location gave a speech. It was awkward because they had nothing to say about FIT because they hadn\u2019t only been to the main campus a few times.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why FIT continues to run the off site classrooms. It can\u2019t be profitable given the small number of students. My suspicion is the government gives FIT a bonus to keep these classrooms open, particularly on the military bases.",

    "postText": "I just finished my application for the fall 2021 semester 8 years after I graduated highschool. I noticed when I was applying that it seemed as though the ACT/SAT scores were now optional, but I am not for certain about that.\n\nCan someone clear that up for me? I still have a month to completely finish my application but I want to make absolute sure that I am not going to miss out because I read it wrong.",

My brother is graduating high school this year and there were several instances where colleges he applied to didn\u2019t expect any at all or required a short, standard placement test instead. Due to the pandemic, he was unable to sit for the exams as well. In my experience, placement classes were dependent on your chosen major (i.e. placing you in an appropriate math course as a first year engineering student).",

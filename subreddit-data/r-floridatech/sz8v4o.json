    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m supposed to be going there in the fall for Forensic psychology because I heard it was a good school. However, I\u2019m seeing all of these other comments about harassment and homophobia and unreported rapes. I\u2019m worried because I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. Please let me know if it\u2019s worth it to come to this school. I have to turn in my deposit by the end of February.",

The school did have a problem with unreported rapes but we replaced the title 9 coordinator and I haven't heard of anything else like that. Also would this is a somewhat more conservative campus there isn't much if any homophobia or the like that I have seen(albeit I'm not lgbtq+). For any stem program this university is great highly recommend I think you would probably like it here",

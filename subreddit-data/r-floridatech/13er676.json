    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a recently admitted transfer student at FIT (BS astronomy and astrophysics). I have a lot of options to weigh, but FIT is at the top of my college list right now primarily due to its location on the Space Coast and the availability of internships. How accessible are these internships? Could I get into the industry as a sophomore? Thank you all!",

I had a friend that had her Nasa internship in Cali instead of here just due to the nature of the work.\nIf you are just looking for space engineering internships, then there are plenty in the DoD contractors like SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, ULA, etc. They offer decent amount of summer internships, but they hire around fall or early spring for them. Also they do typically want a decently high gpa, like 3.5+.",

For example, I just graduated today with an aerospace tech AS degree and technically for that specific degree I had a 4.0 but due to my low gpa for my general AA.. my overall gpa is only a 3.4.",

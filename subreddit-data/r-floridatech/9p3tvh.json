    "postText": "I imagine there are a good number of Aerospace Engineers here?  A friend of mine who teaches physics in high school asked me for some advice today regarding a student of his who has been accepted to an aerospace engineering program in Illinois.  She wants to double major, and doesn't know what additional major would be best.  I'm a physicist myself, and so I'm really not sure what would be best to add to an aerospace engineering major.\n\nThanks in advance for any input you have.",

            "comment": "My husband is an AE prof at FIT, so I asked him. He says: Applied Math is probably the best / least extra work. If the student has a particular interest in the Space part, then Space Sciences is a good fit, and at FIT anyway, does not have a Senior Design component which is a significant consideration - you don't want to have to do senior design twice, it will probably add a whole year to your schooling. Some people do Aerospace and Mechanical, which he says is a bad idea because both require senior design, and employers see them as very similar, so there isn't much advantage. He says if doing a second major will require a whole extra year, you are better off taking two years - doing a single major and getting a masters degree in the second interest.",

They don't have any decent tennis courts under school ownership so that'd be another expense. Womens Golf was highly accoladed the last few years and frankly cutting a team with under 10 participants is a PR fail on their end. Golf especially would have allowed for great fundraising opportunities with donors and alumni. Wondering what they'll now include for Women to be in Title IV compliance. Probably a hail mary to fund a football program marred with controversy and expensive cover ups. Go Panthers.",

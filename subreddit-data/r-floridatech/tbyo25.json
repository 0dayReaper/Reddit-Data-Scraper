Best way to make friends is within your major just start talking to people. I do think the school is pretty LGBT friendly but I'm not apart of it so all I have are friends and my experiences.",

This is a [list of all the clubs](https://floridatech.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations).\n\nThe other nice thing about FIT is it's a relatively small campus. You'll see the same people a lot walking around, and you'll likely have classes with the many of the same people over the years.\n\nAt one point, FIT had more international students than any other university. There are fewer now, but international students still make up a large portion of the student body.",

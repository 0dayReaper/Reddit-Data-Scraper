This would happen like once a year at a bigger school just because of the sheer population difference.  I'm a UF alum and lots of crazy stuff like this would happen.  FL Tech is tiny in comparison.  \n\nI'm kinda surprised the cops shot the guy.  News said he was cornered and armed with a knife.  Sounds like you should just hit him with a taser or clock him with a telescopic batton.  Hard to say when you don't have all the facts though.  \n\nAs an aside, it's not that surprising, as the twenties are when some mental illnesses come to the surface (like schizophrenia).  UF had an almost identical incident a while back.",

It was just an unfortunate situation, the likelihood of something like that happening here again is minuscule don\u2019t even worry about it",

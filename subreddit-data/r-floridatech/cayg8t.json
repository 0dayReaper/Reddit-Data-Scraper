When I tried downloading the software, it was asking for my university details so that they can mail me the license. I want to try fidgeting with the  software before officially starting my classes at FIT as I wasnt taught Matlab during my undergrads. Is it advisable to use my FIT email ID to download Matlab ? Someone please advice.",

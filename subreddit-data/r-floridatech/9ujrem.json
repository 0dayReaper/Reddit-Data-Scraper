    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nI don't know if I did something wrong or I'm just being impatient but I applied to FIT a few weeks ago through Common Applications and yes I know that I need to send my SAT scores and transcript in eventually too. \n\nThe only problem that I find weird is that usually with colleges they give you some way to check your application status by giving you a link to create an account on their website or account information to log into with. FIT only sent me an email which contained some pretty cryptic and unhelpful information. All it really said that was that they needed all the required documents (not said what type of documents specifically in the email but I looked at the website and assumed its just the test scores and everything else is provided through CommonApp) and that I can email those document in these supported file types. Since that email, I haven't received ANYTHING about FIT. Maybe they called me and I usually decline unknown numbers when I'm busy, but even then they should've left a voice mail or something right?\n\nI've emailed my supposed admission counselor yesterday(I had to even look this person up FIT never gave me any info on this too) but she has yet to respond.\n\nTo be honest guys, I'm kind of nervous because I'm not sure if I did something wrong or maybe they just take a while. Let me know if this is normal. Thanks!",

I started one application then stopped half way through. Then I started another application later because the website wouldn't let me resume the first one. They ended up applying my transcripts to my first, incomplete application.\n\nWhen I called, they saw the issue and fixed it.",

Like someone above suggested, contacting admission@fit.edu can do you well, they have student workers keeping up on the mailbox and its typically within a work day response time.   \nIf you have been accepted already, you can contact techsupport@fit.edu if you need help activating your account, though I'll save you a step and suggest calling directly at (321) 674-7284 Mon-Fri 8-5 ET.

    "postText": "I\u2019m a first year grad student (and new to Florida Tech), and haven\u2019t met that many people outside my department. My dept. cohort is small, so I\u2019m curious for grad students who didn\u2019t go here for undergrad, how do you meet grad students from other departments? I\u2019ve looked around online and haven\u2019t been able to find any grad-oriented events hosted by the University either.",

Most of the members of the other clubs are undergrads, but the clubs are open to grad students as well. I was in a few clubs and met a few grad students in the clubs.",

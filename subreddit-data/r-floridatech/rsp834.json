    "postText": "Basically what the title says, I am coming from Texas and have decided Florida would be a good option due to the great OE programs at the schools here. I keep hearing mixed things about both colleges and was wondering what y'alls thoughts were about the two schools. I would also be living off campus and will definitely have to take out loans one way or another if that plays a factor. I am also a bi woman, I have read that FIT is pretty open compared to UF, but I am very concerned about crime and money. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice :)",

            "comment": "Hi, OE here that just graduated with a BS and about to start my MS. I've been at the school for 3.5 years now and I love it. Our OE program is fantastic and all of the professors are extremely open to working with students and helping where they can. The campus is also small so you become very familiar with your cohorts.\n\nWith regards to living situation, at FIT, you have to live on-campus for your first two years unless you have family you can live with. There may be other exceptions, but it's not common for freshman to live off-campus. On-campus living isn't all that bad (try to get into Columbia Village).\n\nFIT is also very accepting of all people regardless of creed, color, race, sexuality, or orientation. There are a few rough characters here and there, of course, but on the whole I don't think you'll ever have a problem. That being said, we do have a non-zero crime rate on campus. Some rapes do occur, and just recently a student went on a punching/stabbing spree (while hopped up on drugs) and ended up dying by cop. So, while it is overall safe, one must always remain vigilant.\n\nAll-in-all, FIT is much better than UF in my opinion. Especially if you are interested in coastal structures or unmanned technologies. Dr. Weavers and Dr. Wood's labs are some of the best places to learn and get experience!",

            "comment": "I graduated with a BS in OE and BS in EE in 1998. So a while ago. I am a male so my experience will necessarily be different than yours.\n\nI loved the education I got from FIT. One of my OE professors is still there (Dr. Swain), two are dead, and two have moved on. \n\nFIT had a great advantage for me, the small class sizes and easily accessible professors. There was a joke in the 90's that may still be there, that OE/OC classes may be cancelled on days with excellent surfing because the professors were out surfing. In my 5 years there, that happened once, but only because the professor showed up but 3/4 of the class didn't (I was one of the 1/4 that did). But it was not unusual for students to go surfing with the professors during non-class time. \n\nBecause of my unusual double major, I had to be quite creative with scheduling and course substitutions. In my final year, I had 4 class time conflicts in fall only classes; two sets of two classes conflicted with each other. We solved one conflict by having me switch from the undergraduate version of a class to the graduate version. The other conflict was not solvable that way and both were required OE classes that would delay my graduation. The professors allowed me to take one class as an independent study and only show up on test days. The professors coordinated with each other to make sure they never had tests on the same day since I would be skipping the one class to test with the other. I don't know how flexible and accommodating other professors would be at other institutions. \n\nCrime rate for Florida Tech is not zero, and there were (and I believe still are) nearby areas that were somewhat higher in crime. But overall Florida Tech is fairly safe. \n\nWe started in our major freshman year and did intro to Oceanography first semester, Intro to Ocean Engineering the second semester. For Oceanography, we went to the beach and did beach profile/bathymetry surveys and went out on the university's research boat and learned various water sampling techniques. For Intro to OE, we built water sampling devices to take samples from the bottom of the pool, and submarines to cross hoops suspended in mid water in the pool. Electronics such as Arduino's and Raspberry Pi's  with all of the remotes and sensors and motors and sub kits were not readily available back then so we had to be a lot more creative.\n\nFIT was not cheap when I attended, and has only gotten more expensive over time, but for me, the education quality was worth the price. My student loans were paid for a long time ago.",

I\u2019ve worked at several and that is a universal sentiment. \n\nYou should be looking at what kind of campus experience you want. Do you want to be at a very very large school with a sports (watching not playing) being a huge part of your social life? \nOr do you want to be at a smaller school where you will know most of the students and professors will definitely know who you are?",

I can and I have literally spoken about this topic for hours, and I have a video in the works regarding all the issues with this school, I\u2019ll try to make it contained. \nThe main problem is the disconnect between administration and the student body. All they aim is making more money, that\u2019s why they concentrate it all on aerospace engineering students and the alumni. Many professors, especially in the physics department are not good, and some are really bad. They school knows that, and their solution was to hide who teaches each class so that people can\u2019t flock to the professor that is better( the president has literally admitted to this out loud). \nOn a different note, are you familiar with the clary act scandal with the school? I\u2019d definitely recommend you look it up, but essentially the school did not report crimes for a few years (they legally have to every year), and this included crimes like rapes and other sexual assaults. Also they shot a kid about a month ago, though police investigations is still on the way there (though they haven\u2019t received cam footage yet which is a bit sus because they\u2019re supposed to release it within a few days).\nFinally, hope you have a perfect perfect schedule and that there\u2019s isn\u2019t a class that\u2019s offered only once a year, because anything other than that they\u2019re gonna give you a lot of annoyances at the registrar office because of how little everyone cares there. I had to graduate a semester late just because of a stupid class, and I know at least another 7 people of the top of my head who had the same issue. \n\nThis isn\u2019t everything of course, instruction is good at this school, but if you get a bad professor you\u2019re pretty much gonna have to learn everything on your own, so you\u2019ve been warned.",

            "comment": "I had a lot of friends in the OE program (we all graduated a few years back) and they all look like their living their best lives. Off the top of my head, I know one of them is currently doing an expedition off the San Diego coast, one of them started their PhD program and travels a lot (even out of the country) for conferences, and some of them wind up at high paying, well respected govt jobs in the DC area. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about UF but honestly if you\u2019re looking for a smaller, tighter-knot group, then you\u2019re better off going to FIT. In that dept, people tend to have really good working relationships with their advisor. I was in a different program in that dept and I still keep in touch with my advisor. Classes are small, their interactive from what I\u2019ve seen, and the field projects they all do sound really interesting. \n\nLike others said, crime is not nonexistent in MLB but you\u2019ll get crime near/on campus anywhere you go. \n\nDon\u2019t worry too much about money, especially if you\u2019re going in with some sort of scholarship. I graduated with debt but definitely not as much as I expected due to my admissions scholarship and a scholarship I earned halfway through my time there. There are also other scholarships you can qualify to apply for if you keep your GPA up and/or get involved around campus. The financial aid is there but sometimes you have to go searching for it. Also make sure you get their alumni scholarship and visit scholarship. I did that and got 8K knocked off from my four years there.",

            "comment": "The biggest benefit of FIT over UF will be the class sizes. You\u2019ll have much smaller classes at FIT. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s important to you or not.\n\nUF is way more recognized nationally though. A lot of people even FL don\u2019t know of FIT because it\u2019s so small.\n\nAlso, no one cares about sports at FIT. UF has huge football, basketball and baseball stadiums and students actually go to the games. Again, I don\u2019t know if you care about sports.\n\nI went to a school with Division 1 sports before going to FIT. The sports were a major distraction. I noticed my grades were worse when I spent so much time watching and attending the games.",

The cost of tuition depends on lots of factors so you may need to contact financial aid for more information. [Here's another page specifically for international students.](https://www.fit.edu/financialaid/prospective-students/international-students/) Hope that helps, but let me know if you need anything else.",

            "comment": "Depends on your scholarship. Without one, Florida Tech asks you to prove that you can pay about $58k per year (specifically $58,446). \n\nFor a degree in Engineering and Science for international students, this is the breakdown to expect (approx.) per year:\n\n* **Tuition &amp; Fees:** $43,246\n* **Living Expenses:** $10,400\n* **Health Insurance:** $1,430\n* **Other:** $3,370\n\nAnd keep in mind this isn't negotiable: as a senior, I live off campus, have health insurance via family, etc. And my tuition is mostly covered by my parent's work, but also we never pay the whole thing at once, but by semester. So the actual cost is actually much lower (except maybe for the first year) but this is just needed for International Admittance and is honestly a ridiculous standard since no one really has almost $60k stashed away in their bank account on the off chance they need to go to college.",

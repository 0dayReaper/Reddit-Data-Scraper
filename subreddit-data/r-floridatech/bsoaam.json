It\u2019s not a bad environment but it\u2019s also not as nurturing as the stereotypical college campus. Being gay on campus has not been bad but it\u2019s just not supported like it is in more liberal arts schools.",

In addition, the Title IX Office will help you protect your federally mandated rights to a discrimination free education.",

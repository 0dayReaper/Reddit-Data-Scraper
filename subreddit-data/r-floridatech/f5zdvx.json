    "postText": " In January, Florida Tech security restricted access to crime logs, interpreting the federal law in the narrowest possible way. Instead of emailing crime logs, or even posting them online like Rollins College, you can now only access the crime logs in the security office, under supervision. The records will not be emailed, and you are not allowed to take photos.\u00a0  \n\n\nWhat can you do to remind the security department that these are YOUR records? What can you do to make it easier for the Crimson to report on campus crime?\u00a0  \n\n\n [http://crimson.fit.edu/?p=1405](http://crimson.fit.edu/?p=1405)",

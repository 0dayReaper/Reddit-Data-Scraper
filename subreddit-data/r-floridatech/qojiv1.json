            "comment": "Size of the school can be an issue. Since some classes were fall only or spring only, if you are following a non-traditional schedule, you could find yourself in a jam as you got closer to the end. \n\nI was double majoring since they didn't allow minoring in degrees in the 90's. My final fall semester, I had 4 classes that were fall only and conflicted in time schedules as two pairs of two. We (since it required professor and dept head approval) were able to solve one conflict by switching me from the undergraduate version of one class to the graduate version. We couldn't resolve the other set of conflicts that way, but the advantage to it being a small school came into play. One professor agreed to do the class as a self-study with me, and the professors made sure to never give tests on the same day. So I skipped the non-self study class on days when their were tests in the other class to take the test.\n\nSome degrees/departments are better than others. \n\nOverall, I was very happy with the education I received. Some of my acquaintances were not and transferred schools after a year or two.",

However, compared to similar schools, this is about the same incentive program like Embry-Riddle I think. \n\nIt was mentioned above but if you are planning on or want to double major (for example: Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering only requires an extra year to get both) the administrative system makes it very difficult to get the right classes and be processed properly in their electronic systems. I had trouble changing my declaration, getting help choosing, dropping, and registering for classes, and I had trouble petitioning to graduate with the proper degrees which resulted in me being sent three diplomas, two separate and one with the combined degrees and they had me ship back the combined diploma. Although, I would expect that other schools have similar problems that just don\u2019t get talked about much. \n\nDr. Demoret is running the Aerospace Engineering program senior design projects right now and she is very good so assuming she is still running them when prospective students would be seniors and your major is Aerospace Engineering, she is a major pro for this school over others.\n\nI don\u2019t want to turn anybody off of FIT because it has some very good things about it but these were just my personal experiences which I haven\u2019t seen mentioned elsewhere. Anyone can feel free to message me to talk about this stuff or about Residence Life at FIT which is a whole other can of worms.",

Other than that (and the humidity), it's a pretty great school. Just dont expect it to be easy academically, it's a pretty challenging school.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m late to the game because I just found the FIT community on here, so here are my two cents!\n\nI graduated several of years ago and went to a very large D1 university for graduate school. One thing I\u2019m incredibly grateful for and something you won\u2019t find at a university like FIU or FSU are tiny classes where you actually get to know the professor. This can come at a cost though because some programs are so small at FIT that you\u2019ll probably only graduate with one, maybe two in your program. I was in a tiny, tiny program so I had a great relationship with my advisor but my friends in aerospace and mechanical engineering didn\u2019t really have that kind of professional relationship due to the sheer size of those programs. But their capstone projects are usually taken so seriously that engineering firms, govt contractors, program managers, etc. always are interested in what the students come up with. This is based on what my roommates and cohort told me and experienced, so that isn\u2019t my own personal experience. \n\nMy cohort was great and super diverse and again, I just don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find that at many schools. I met so many people from different parts of the world and was able to immerse myself in their cultures. Every two weeks, my friend group would rotate who is hosting our cultural night and we would have food from home country, play their games, tell stores, etc. I miss that so much because my grad program wasn\u2019t very diverse. \n\nLocation wise, I liked it because I\u2019m not a huge nightlife person but it\u2019s called Melboring by those who like to party. The cape keeps things interesting. \n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves about the school was how the university deals with more scandalous stuff, like Title IX, since they are a private university. I reported a professor multiple times for sexual harassment and nothing ever came of it. That\u2019s an isolated incident but those in charge tend to sweep big things under the rug. Again - that\u2019s just my experience. \n\nAside from that big personal problem, I think FIT is a great school with great resources. I feel like it does enough to help you succeed post graduation.",

    "postText": "I usually set up a payment plan every semester and forgot to set one up on time for my 3rd semester this summer. The deadline for the first installment was 3 days ago on May 4th- PAWS still allowed me to pay the first installment and I have the next ones due on June 1st and July 1st but my Canvas says I'm not currently enrolled in any courses (but it does say I'm still Web registered for the 3 classes on PAWS.) What will happen? Someone please help. I can't call the office until they open tomorrow",

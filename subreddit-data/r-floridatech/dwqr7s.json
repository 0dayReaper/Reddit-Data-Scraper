I'm working full time and would need to continue that stable income through school if I want to stay alive. I'd also have to commute to school about an hour and a half each way and I don't know how much that would affect me. \n\nAny info and advice would be appreciated",

My employer kicks in for tuition - I don't know if your company has that sort of thing.\n\nHaving gone for a couple semesters now, I can tell you schedule makes a huge impact. With the caveat that I live and work within a few miles of FIT, I found that an evening (or late afternoon) class is no big deal. But this semester I took a daytime class and a afternoon class (neither class is regularly offered, so not a lot of options), and it does make getting my 40 hours in a challenge. If you've got a flexible schedule, it can be done.\n\nIf you do take classes at FIT, I suggest taking one evening class and seeing how it goes.\n\nBut honestly, spending what would likely be 6 hours a week in the car would kill me. Where do you live? There might be an option [closer to home](https://www.universities.com/find/florida/best/mathematics-and-science/space-sciences).",

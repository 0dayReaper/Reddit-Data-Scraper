    "postText": "\ud83d\udc4b Hey! Anyone in the computer information systems graduates program and can give me some insights? I want to know what careers recent graduates have gone on to, or is a Ph.D. an option? How does a day in the life of a CIS student look like? \n\nI am from Norway and I have been accepted to the program- I just want to get some more information before I accept my seat. I have a good impression of FIT already, but you never know! \n\nThank you! I appreciate your help.",

            "comment": "I am currently doing CIS. CIS is just a small subset of the whole department. If you look at the class selection for CIS, we take classes from cyber, engineering management, CS, and Computer Engineering.\n\nIf you are interested in a mixed field and want to explore different courses from other departments, then CIS is the way. \n\nIf you have a niche you are passionate about in the other departments, maybe pursue the other ones. \n\nMy days are full but really manageable since I have working experience. \n\nJust be ready to have some of your classes online, which is a bit disappointing for me since I paid for on-campus courses. This is especially true for the mandatory courses that are, for who knows what reason, only offered online. \n\nIf you want to maximize your investment, your electives can be geared towards the Cyber Security Grad Cert. So by the time you graduate, you get a CIS MS and a Cyber Grad Cert. I wished I knew this earlier.\n\nP.S if some of the points are not clear, I was typing on my phone while eating at Pather Hall. The food here is good so that\u2019s a plus",

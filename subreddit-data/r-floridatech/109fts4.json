Meaning even in a weekend, there\u2019s lots of people around cuz they live on campus. During weekdays, classes are goin on, so that\u2019s when it\u2019s busiest.\n\nIf you are a prospective student, get in touch with the  admissions office and arrange for a tour. Back when I was there they had those tours even on weekends, not sure if it\u2019s still a thing, so definitely touch base with Admissions for that.",

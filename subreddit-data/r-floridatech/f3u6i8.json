    "postText": "If you are in need of advice, I strongly encourage you to look up alumni in your fields of interest. Go ahead and cold call or email us from the alumni directory. \n\nHaving graduated years ago, I expected current students to reach out to me and other alumni more frequently than they are. Friends I\u2019ve graduated with have run into other FIT grads in their jobs but none have had current students contact them. \nWe\u2019re out here and are very interested in helping with interview, resume, senior projects, and other advice. \n\nI\u2019m an aerospace engineer and I\u2019ve worked on commercial airplanes and wind turbines for the past 9 years. Oof 9 years? I\u2019m old.",

I currently run my own software development company providing LabVIEW contracting/consulting/development services. Much of my experience is in Automated Test, Manufacturing Test, and Machine Control, with some Microgrid power distribution thrown in for good measure.   \n\n\nI am a LabVIEW Architect and National Instruments Certified Professional Instructor.  \n\n\nI am also open to being contacted for any of the above.",

Hopefully this year more students will! \n\nThese mock interviews, in my opinion, are also a great time to ask questions. \n\nIf anyone has feed back on the mock interview process. Feel free to message me",

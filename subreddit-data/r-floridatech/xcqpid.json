    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am looking for participants for my dissertation. The study consists of a survey that will take approximately 5-7 minutes to complete and includes a request at the end to forward a brief survey to your manager (if possible). These surveys are connected via an anonymous code and neither party will be privy to each other\u2019s responses.\n\nThe survey is open to anyone who is employed at least 20 hours per week, reports directly to a manager, speaks English, and is at least 18 years of age. Responses will be kept anonymous, and no individual or employer names will be collected. All participants have the option to enter a drawing (not connected to survey responses) to win one of five Amazon gift cards.\n\nIf you are able to assist, please follow the link below to participate in the survey. Please share the survey with your network to further help me collect data.\nPlease contact me at khoelzel2016@my.fit.edu if you have any questions, and thank you in advance for your help with my doctoral\nresearch!\n\nSurvey link: https://fit.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9Afx3OGrlpqOTUq \n\nThanks!",

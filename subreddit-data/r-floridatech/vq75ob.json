You can replace Joss. There are plenty of other douchebags for hire out there, but only one chance to respect FIT alumni and long time staff.\n\nPick a side.",

I would complain to everyone involved. I'd like to see the reason behind the teams they chose to eliminate.\n\nSadly, I think we're going to see many more schools eliminating sports teams in the next couple years as inflation rises and a recession hits. FIT is ahead of everyone else and cutting these teams now may turn out to be a good decision in the future.",

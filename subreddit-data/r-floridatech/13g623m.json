Does anyone have information?  Also, how helpful is the University with finding a job after graduation? \n\nThanks \ud83c\udf0c",

They also setup a career fair each semester. They might be able to direct you to some job postings when you're nearing graduation, but they're not going to directly place you in a job.\n\nNo university is going to directly place you in a job after graduation unless maybe you're a med student where hospitals select you for residency. I went to both FIT and a large public university the career services were the same.\n\nThe best service they provide is helping you find an internship. Many students have no job experience when they graduate. If you can get an internship in planetary science, you'll likely either be offered job by the company you're doing an internship for, or you'll at least have some experience to put on your resume.",

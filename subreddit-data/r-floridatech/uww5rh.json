I am about 3 courses shy of an M.S. in Space Studies - Astronomy.\n\nI am interested in the Space Sciences PhD at FIT. I can't seem to find a curriculum or course catalog anywhere.\n\nWhat would you say is the difference in this program and a traditional Astronomy program at another university?",

The [class descriptions are posted online](https://catalog.fit.edu/content.php?catoid=14&amp;navoid=678). It looks like there are only 9 classes to choose from. The catalog someone says you can take other classes as well for credit if you get approval.",

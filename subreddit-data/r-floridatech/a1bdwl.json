    "postText": " \n\nHi!\u00a0\n\nI'm looking for a roommate to join me in a 2 bedroom apartment at Parks at Via Velino (right across the street from campus) between December an January. The rent would be about $550/mo + electricity and internet. I have one cat who is usually very well behaved (but we would welcome another pet/friend).\u00a0\n\nPlease let me know if you're interested or have any questions!",

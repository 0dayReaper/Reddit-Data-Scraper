    "postText": "Hey everybody,\n\nI\u2019m going into my first semester of the Psy.D program at the university and am looking for a male roomate between the ages of 22-28. I\u2019m M24 and am a very clean individual that enjoys watching sports, spending time at the library, and training for triathlons. Currently I am looking at spaces at Braxton and Trillium but would be open to other living options. Please feel to message me or comment with any questions.\n\nThank you,\nRyan",

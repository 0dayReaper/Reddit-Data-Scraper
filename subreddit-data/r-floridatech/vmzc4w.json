D2 generates almost no revenue yet some students are required to be on scholarship.\n\nI thought there was chance FIT could move up to D1/FCS when there was a football team. The football team was decent and even made the playoffs one year. The attendance at the games was good the first two seasons but dropped off after that.\n\nThe students are partly to blame. The students do not show interest in sports. Almost no one goes to any games. The student section at the football games was empty after the first year.\n\nThe problem is no other schools in Florida play in D3. FIT needs to convince some members of the Sunshine State Conference to change to D3. They could also try to get some of the Sun Conference teams, which are NAIA, to change to D3 too.",

Players are getting paid salaries, coaches make millions, and  players can now transfer to different teams at any time so they can get more playing time. The school is irrelevant to the players other than as a means to get paid to play sports.\n\nI think D3 sports are the way it should be. The players don\u2019t get paid. The players first priority is their academics because they\u2019re not on scholarships to play sports. The coaches still get paid but their salary is similar to other university employees.",

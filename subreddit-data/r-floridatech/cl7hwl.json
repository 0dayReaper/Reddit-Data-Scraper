    "postText": "Hey guys...\n\nJust as the title says; will have a room available in a house just right off Florida Ave. (near UV and the soccer fields) by around September. Rent is about $400 + utilities + FPL, which comes out to around $550 a month. We are FIT Alumni students living near the school and currently working in the area, so we would prefer someone in a similar situation,  grad school students or other age-related persons working around the area (maturity reasons).\n\nPM me if anyone is interested and we can maybe set up a meetup.\n\nThanks!",

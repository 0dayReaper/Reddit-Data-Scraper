If you're planning on using engineering software frequently I would probably suggest a Windows PC. That being said, there are plenty of labs on campus available that have the software pre-installed. If you're not ready to buy a whole new laptop, you can definitely survive with a Mac for papers and stuff, while using lab computers for work (although not conveniently.)  \nSource: Work in Tech Support Center on Campus",

If you want to be mobile and spend money, get a PC with lots of RAM. If working off a school computer suits you better financially, stick with what you got. I don't recommend parallels due to the performance hit. You'll pull your hair out waiting on certain things.",

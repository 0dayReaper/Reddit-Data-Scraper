    "postText": "I am between Florida tech and UCF for either computer science or electrical engineering. With scholarships combined both schools will basically be free. I also do not care that much about missing the \"party life\" or any of that. I am more looking for somewhere to get a really good education, good internships, and network. I toured both and really liked Florida Tech, but I was hoping someone can give some input on this. Thank you!",

            "comment": "The education at these two schools for those programs will be on par with one another. \n\nUCF has a bigger employment, internship office- and more resources in that area. \n\nNetwork is hard to say, FIT is in close spatial proximity to many companies but has bad relationships with some of them. The alumni base is largely uninterested in the university population. \n\nFIT is very close to the beach but there really isn\u2019t much else to do in Melbourne to relax. UCF has Orlando to explore when you need a break. \n\nUCF is going to be a larger better funded school, with more resources for success. Although you will be one of tens of thousands. \n\nFIT is going to be a smaller school with more access to research opportunities. Albeit that comes with a lack of academic resources compared to other larger universities. \n\nSo in your calculus you need to think about what comes next. If you wish to become good at what you are doing and be better connected to a job with a degree from a more respected uni; go to UCF. \n\nIf you plan on preparing for a career in academia/want to pursue a graduate degree fresh outta undergrad;  go to FIT.",

            "comment": "Classes are generally smaller at FIT than UCF. For some people, smaller classes are important since professors are usually able to give more individual attention.\n\nAlso, since FIT is smaller, you should have the ability to make more of an impact on campus. There are less people competing to be leaders in clubs and to participate in research.\n\nI complain about FIT being a Division 2 sports school, but there is some benefit to not being in Division 1. I went to a school with D1 sports and the sports were distracting. I would have gotten better grades if I weren't watching sports or going to sporting events constantly.",

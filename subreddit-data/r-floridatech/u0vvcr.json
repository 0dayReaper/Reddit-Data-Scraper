    "postText": "I am an international student who got accepted into Florida Tech and I applied with my transcript through common app which was submitted by my counselor. \nNow they are asking for me to send an official transcript through electronic transcript mail delivery services but my school does not use any of those. I have been emailing the international student officer for FIT but there is no reply and it has been weeks. Any help on what to do or any other means to submit my transcript or anyone I can talk to because I really want to attend FIT and don\u2019t want to waste time.",

I would call if you didn't get an email answer. I believe you need to call the registrar. I assume they are going to tell you to have your school send your transcript through postal mail if they can't do it electronically.",

I got financial aid but it was not much and wanted ways to cover more amount of the tuition. \nPs- I got admission to Aeronautical Science with Flight and I want to even do without flight. Could it be changed?",

I recommend that you go there yourself and ask random students if they\u2019re struggling or not in this institution. Good luck!",

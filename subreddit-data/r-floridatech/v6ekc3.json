More specifically, the women in stem live in Columbia and im interested living there with them if possible. But I don\u2019t like the idea of having to do pay for laundry or walking across the street (from my understanding) to do laundry. Is it truly a hassle ? \n\nIn your opinion would Harris be the better option? Is the most social out of them all? \n\nAs well if I\u2019m wanting to explore the idea of moving off campus, most schools have like a Facebook where students can reach out to see if anyone is looking for a roommate or if anyone is subletting. Is there one?",

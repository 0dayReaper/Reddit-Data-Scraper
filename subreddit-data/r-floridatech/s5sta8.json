Then I started an application again, but apparently I accidentally created a new account. When FIT received my transcripts, my documents got attached to my incomplete application. I almost wrote FIT off because I didn't hear anything, but I called and a nice person in the admissions office noticed the discrepancy and fixed it. I got a decision within a few days.\n\nIn short, I would definitely call or email to follow up. Put that application fee to work!",

Physics majors have to take chemistry 1/2  which is unique to this school. Pointless classes that you will relearn further down the road in a physics degree in classes like thermo/quantum. The workload is manageable, but surface level compared to the tests/homeworks i have seen from other universities. \n\nBad wifi, hard to reach professors. Ive gotten to know most of my professors well, and still none of them will write a recommendation letter purely because they don't answer their email in a timely fashion. The food is good for the first week you're here, then after that it all tastes the same. They cant even cook rice which is beyond me when you are paying 15$ for a meal. \n\nFacilities are crumbling and the resources aren't there, unless you are aerospace. 90% of the student body is republican. Cool if that's your thing, it's not mine though. The school is ridiculously priced and there is nothing to do in the area compared to some cheaper schools near by (with better programs) like ucf, uf, and fsu. Maybe one or two parties every weekend, go to one and you've been to them all. If you are aerospace engineering however, prepared to be surrounded by the most insufferable elon musk stans that would suck his toes to work at spacex. Also don't get fooled by the proximity to Kennedy space center because \n\n1. You might go there once\n2. It is a 1hr drive \n3. You don't have any better chance working there going to FIT",

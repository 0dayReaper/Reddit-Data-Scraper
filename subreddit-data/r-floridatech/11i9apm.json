    "postText": "So throughout highschool i was an C average student my gpa being a 2.2-2.3 not because i\u2019m dumb but just because it never really interest me to go all out for honors or study for All A+ but i did apply for a bs under construction management which i already do construction rn as a senior and want to pursue this as a career. I feel like i would actually apply myself to ace these classes and do the most i can not to fail but what do y\u2019all think? good idea or dumb?",

            "comment": "People say it's never too late to change, but it's unlikely your habits are going to change greatly in college. The good news is you only need to maintain above a 2.0 GPA to graduate in college. No one will ever know if you graduate from college with a 2.2-2.3 GPA.\n\nWith a 2.2-2.3 GPA, it's unlikely you would get into FIT. Last year, the average GPA was 3.7. To increase your chances, you could apply to start in summer term. Admission standards are slightly lower in summer.\n\nYou might also consider starting at community/state college to see if college is right for you. You can transfer to a university later. It would give you time to figure out your major too.",

It would be cheaper and give you more time to cement plans for your undergraduate degree. A lot of your courses would transfer over to uni as well so it might not take the full 4 years for your BA / BS.",

            "comment": "I'd agree with the other commenters that you should definitely start at a community college.  If you're in Brevard, that would be Eastern Florida State College (EFSC, formerly BCC).  True, it's never too late to change, but change takes time.  A community college will give you that time, and save you a bunch of money, too.  EFSC, in particular, is a feeder school for FIT, and there's a guy at FIT--one of their transfer coordinators--who can help you make sure you're good to go with a smooth transfer to FIT when you're ready.  Once you graduate, nobody will care that you started out at a community college, so in your case I really don't see any downside to going this route.\n\nIn order to bring your GPA up into the range you'll need to get accepted at FIT, you'll need to learn a whole bunch of new study habits, and EFSC would be a good place to do that.  I'd urge you to take full advantage of all the support services they offer.  Don't be shy about going to the Learning Lab!  Also, start hanging out with the top students.  Let their habits and attitudes rub off on you.  Most of us are more influenced by our friends than we'd care to admit, so choose those friends carefully.\n\nThe standard of teaching at EFSC is mostly pretty high (as at most community colleges), since the professors there are there because they wanted to teach rather than sit in their labs doing research.  Also, if you aren't immediately successful at building all the new habits you'll need, EFSC is a much cheaper place to have to repeat a course than FIT is.  Just sayin'.....  :-)\n\nThe other thing I'd suggest is that you start out at half-time rather than taking a full load of courses.  You're going to need the extra time while you figure out what works for you in terms of studying, and it's better to start slowly and succeed rather than diving in head-first and making a GPA mess that'll take a long time to fix.  Not that I'd expect you to fail, but some caution is probably a good thing.\n\nBest of luck to you.  It's a long road, but you can do it.",

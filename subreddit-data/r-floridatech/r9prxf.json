    "postText": "I'm in the process of filling out my application for the Clinical Psychology Psy.D. doctoral program at FIT, and the requirements are leaving me incredibly discouraged. The Graduate Admissions page states that most of the people who are admitted have both a bachelor's and a master's degree with at least a 3.2 in graduate coursework, while I only have my bachelor's in psychology (with a minor in biology and a couple different kinds of honors). Undergraduate GPA isn't an issue for me, but I've taken no graduate coursework whatsoever. I have also heard about how competitive this program is. This is the only program I'm applying to that requires the GRE and GRE Psych in the midst of a pandemic, and I really don't want to invest almost 400$ in total to get everything ready for this application if I don't have much of a shot at getting in anyway. Can anyone speak on this program or let me know what they think? Is this program really that much better than NLU's, NSU's, or Carlos Albizu's? Do I honestly have a shot at getting in?",

I can\u2019t speak to the clinical program, but I\u2019m super happy with my decision to come here :) I only have good things to say about the professors, research opportunities, and program culture so far.",

            "comment": "The important thing you want to know is if their posted requirements are hard minimums or if everyone is considered. If they throw out applications below a certain GRE or GPA then there really is no point in applying. Many programs have an \"initial cut\" similar to that while others look at applications. Sending an email is a great way to get them to look out for your application and shows you're interested, that really does matter. Best of luck!",

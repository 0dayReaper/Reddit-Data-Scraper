I\u2019m not very sure of the official title, but it\u2019s very much like a TA. For what it\u2019s worth, my bf gets paid pretty horribly there but from what I understand that\u2019s very common for graduate student workers everywhere. I have to work part time and go to school full time, he\u2019s working at campus at FIT and then a second job off campus while also going to school full time. If you live on your own as in paying your own bills, I\u2019d be cautious of devoting yourself to any position where they pay your tuition because you will not have time for a full time job outside campus. If not, I\u2019d take advantage of reaching out to your department heads to see if there\u2019s any position available in exchange for tuition reduction or waiver.",

TA's work in the classroom, give lectures, grade assignments, and help students with their class work. RAs help professors with their research.\n\nI had a friend who worked as an RA a couple years ago. I can't remember for sure how much he was getting, but I think he said something like $15/hr because I remember it being around double minimum wage. It was only part-time though.",

But the thing is the department is head is always trying to push him to be on campus every day for random tasks, which is obviously not doable.",

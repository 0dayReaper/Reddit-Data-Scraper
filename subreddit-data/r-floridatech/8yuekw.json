I know FIT can be stingy about certain things (like I heard they completely disable your [my.fit.edu](https://my.fit.edu) email...), so I am wondering if they would do the same for this.  I read the terms and services (at least what they showed me before purchasing) and didn't see anything about the licenses having a time limit. Thanks!",

Even the Google drive on your account lasts forever  (unlike your udrive at [cloud.fit.edu](https://cloud.fit.edu)). Your office subscription will expire though, so keep that in mind.  \n  \nEdit: Verified, Windows 10 keys purchased/obtained from Microsoft Imagine do not expire. Just keep your key safe in case something happens to it. You're limited to one",

It shows you're a college grad or at least in college.",

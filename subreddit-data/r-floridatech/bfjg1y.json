Yeah sure you get your own bedroom but Roberts you leave your door open when you're back from class and all your friends can just randomly stop by and hang out. THAT's what you're going to miss most when you graduate. The quad is ok but it's kind of like Mad Max. If you want to easily make loads of friends and contacts right off the bat Roberts is the way to go.",

            "comment": "Which dorms are the freshman dorms these days? It's been a few years since I lived on campus. If you end up in Columbia or Roberts, I'd recommend some sort of wheeled campus transport (skateboard or bike, etc.) Pretty much all your classes and the dining hall are on the opposite end of campus.\n\nHowever, some things you might want to bring to any dorm:\n\n-A large towel and/or robe for walking to the bathroom if it's down the hall - and make sure it's unique and not easily mixed up with others.\n\n-A good foam mattress pad. Dorm beds aren't the most comfortable.\n\n-Good headphones make good roommates.\n\n-A basic hand tool kit (screwdrivers, allen keys, pliers, hammer, etc.). Not everyone brings one, and they come in handy during move-in. Also a good way to meet their new dorm mates.\n\nAlso, be aware of rules about kitchen appliances. Or at least be discreet.",

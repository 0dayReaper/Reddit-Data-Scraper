    "postText": "My employer is paying for a masters in systems engineering and I have the option of going to UCF or FIT. I researched both schools and both are quality schools and both programs will be online. I like the idea of becoming a Knight (friends who went there, football games, etc) but I'm in Melbourne so FIT is closer (in case I want to use their ammenities) and has an accelerated program so I'll graduate in 2.5 years (UCF will be 3.5 years). I am married and have a baby on the way so I'm wanting to do a program that isn't going to be that demanding on me; which brings me to my question, is FIT easier or harder than UCF? I know it sounds lazy, but I want the degree mostly to have on my resume for promotion/hiring purposes.",

            "comment": "I've been a student at both schools, though admittedly my time at UCF wasn't in engineering.  Engineering classes at FIT are very challenging, and I would say it's probably the tougher school.  So if you're looking only for the easier path, then UCF would probably be the better fit for you.\n\nThat said, FIT has some solid advantages:\n\n* Tougher classes will likely make you a better engineer.\n* FIT has an excellent reputation, especially locally.\n* Networking opportunities are probably better.\n* The accelerated program you mention.\n* A smaller school makes a lot of things easier, as opposed to attending a very large school (like UCF) where you're just a number.  If you need any kind of help from the faculty or staff, you're more likely to get it at FIT.  Things in general just seem to run smoothly there, administratively.\n\nIf it were me, and especially if my employer were paying the not-inconsiderable tuition, I'd choose to suck it up, admit I wasn't going to have a life for the next 2.5 years and go with FIT.  But you do have a family to consider, and YMMV, of course.",

In my experience small schools are easier than larger schools because you have a closer relationship with your instructors and classmates (especially if your more on the introverted side), while (as you said) you feel like more of a number in a large school. For those reasons, I would have assumed UCF would be harder, but I know FIT has a strong focus on engineering so I can imagine they demand more from their students.",

I definitely do better in a program where my professors know my name!  So that would be vote for FIT, even though I suspect the classes are objectively more difficult.\n\nThat said, one thing I didn't address before is that you're going to be in a graduate program, and that makes a difference.  Being in a graduate program is kind of like being in a small school all of its own, and in the case of a grad program at a big school, it's like it's been inserted into the larger school, but it's not like you're swimming in the great big ocean outside with all the undergraduate fish.  You're more of a bigger fish in a smaller pond.\n\nSo at the graduate level, I suspect the big school / small school thing will make less of a difference.",

I found ucf to be significantly easier than anything at FIT.  The exams were open book and open time, like given a weekend to work them. That was pretty rough. Tests like that where the book doesn\u2019t help.",

Some with six, some with ten\n\nMy class size is very small right now. About 4 people. We get out usually within 1.5 to 2 hours. The classes are supposed to be four hours but I only had that happen once. There is no final masters exam. Only a project.\n\nYou will put work in. I had to write two research papers so far. One I actually am trying to publish. So it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\nI can\u2019t compare it to UCF because I never went there.\n\nI think it\u2019s doable if you stick with it. It\u2019s over before you know it.",

Sports aren't important, it would just be nice to go to a game or two if I had the time. \nYes I'm sure, we had an info session with the program director who confirmed employees do not need to be local because classes will be online.\nHe might have been mistaken about the ammenities, but he did say they were available for us to use if we were local. This isn't a deal breaker either. Mostly just wanting to know which is easier \ud83d\ude05",

It looks like every business is gone except the Middle Eastern restaurant.\n\nI was hoping they'd demolish University Plaza and the old 7-Eleven, and build a copy of L3Harris Commons.  I think it would look awesome and impressive driving down Babcock and seeing two of the L3Harris Commons buildings on each side of the road. It would fit perfectly where University Plaza, 7-Eleven, and Mobil are currently location. I made a mockup with my incredible photo editing skills.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzlg0dioze4b1.jpg?width=759&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b481c219738a42b087a5ee1773f9e7bb3b217d02",

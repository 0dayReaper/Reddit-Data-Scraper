    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI am hoping to attend FIT in the Fall 2019. Is there a specific area I should look into moving to, neighborhoods or any college populated apartments? I do not want to live on campus through FIT. Never been to the area, so I am not sure which neighborhoods are the best, or just has more surrounding restaurants, nightlife, activities, etc. ",

It's mostly surrounded by houses.\n\nThere are a lot of restaurants and stores on Palm Bay Road, south of FIT, but you won't be with as many students if you live in that area.",

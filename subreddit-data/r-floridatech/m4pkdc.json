It\u2019s more of \u201cdoes the candidate checks all the boxes\u201d?\n\n- Does the candidate have at least a 3.0 GPA?\n- Does the candidate have previous involvement with research? (A publication is a bonus)\n- Does the candidate has her/his own funding? ( This is a really big deal)\n- Is the candidate already in the USA ( borders closed because of COVID, this became an issue)\n\nThis is far from a comprehensive list. The point is, it\u2019s about the candidate",

I know one PhD program (I won't say which and it's not one of the fields you listed) had so few applicants, they accepted anyone who met the minimum requirements. My guess is the environmental science and oceanography programs are somewhere in between.",

    "postText": " Hello everyone,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I am still searching, now almost frantically, for off-campus housing.\u00a0 All of my tuition, fees, and books SHOULD be covered for the semester and the next.\u00a0 The rest is up to me.\u00a0 I should have about $2000 on-hand to put towards living somewhere.\u00a0 Which means I can pay up to $400/month TOTAL for at least the Fall semester.\u00a0 I qualify for Federal Work Study, so I should have a small income as well, probably starting in September.\u00a0 After the Fall semester, I will be month to month for the Spring, but you can be sure that I will get it done.\u00a0 So the cheaper the monthly rent for the Fall, the more I can stash away for the Spring.\u00a0\u00a0Optimally, I'm looking for a just private room close to campus, access to washer/dryer/kitchen, and a parking spot for whatever car I bring.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I am still willing to really think outside the box here.\u00a0 I have done so much just to get this school secured and paid for, and I will do whatever it takes to attend this school.\u00a0 The car living is still not completely out of the question.\u00a0\u00a0I'm planning for the worst case scenario that way there are no surprises.\u00a0 I can totally live off peanut butter and jelly and cup noodles if I must.\u00a0 The free food events on campus will also help.\n\n\u00a0 The bottom line is I know what this school has to offer and the opportunities it can bring.\u00a0 I do not come from a wealthy background, but I am will to dig myself a hole if I know I can build a mountain afterwards.\u00a0 The less stress I have about my living situation, the more I can focus on my studies.\u00a0 I plan on living in the library and the gym most of the time, so I am certainly not a hassle.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 After the first couple weeks of July, and I can't find anything, I will consider buying a small van so I have more comfort than a small car.\u00a0 I was planning on bringing my Supra (it's just an 1987), but she isn't very roomy.\u00a0 So if anyone knows of an area that may be favorable to park a car overnight, safely, please let me know.\u00a0 I currently live on the other coast of Florida at the moment and will be taking a road trip the first week of July to Melbourne to hammer out some things and re-explore the area.\u00a0 Thank you all so much in advance for whatever advice and tips you may have!  Feel free to PM me.",

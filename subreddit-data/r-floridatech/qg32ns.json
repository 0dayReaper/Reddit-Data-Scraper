For the deposit, just be sure you are doing it on Panther Pass and not some dubious similar looking site. \n\nIf you got your PantherPass account, just follow the checklist, there will be a part where you will make a deposit for admissions and housing/meal plan. \n\nJust so you know, they will not give you this amount directly, it will show on your account PAWS under finance once you confirm enrollment of classes for the semester. \n\nThe admissions team usually respond 1-2 business days but that depends on their workload.",

That\u2019s scamming 101.\n\nI think there\u2019s a good chance that it isn\u2019t a legit link, hover over it without clicking and see if it shows a different address. \n\nLike the other person mentioned, you can try going to pantherpass directly and see if there\u2019s anything indicating that you qualify for a scholarship.",

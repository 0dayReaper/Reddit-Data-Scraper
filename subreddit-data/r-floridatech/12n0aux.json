Any information on the Uni and the city itself would be useful.\n\nP.S. I am hoping to be in Aerospace Engineering as a International student.",

            "comment": "I'll speak from the grad perspective since I didn't do my undergrad there\n\n\nPros:\n-Knowledgeable and experienced teachers\n\n-School has a great reputation\n\n-Insane networking opportunities, considering the school's proximity to all the tech companies in the area. You've got Boeing, Northropp, Leonardo DRS, Blue Origin, SpaceX, NASA, Space Force, Collins, ect ect\n\n-What I learned in my degree has been directly applicable to the job I got nearby after graduating\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Extraordinarily expensive\n\n-Dishonesty in their marketing. For example, I went there to partake in a Cubesat program they had, but it turns out the person who ran that program hadn't been at the school for years but they never changed their course offerings.\n\n-Melbourne can feel a bit rundown at times, but there's the beach and Viera if you want some ritzy areas\n\n-The school itself is superbly liberal, but the area around it is not...I guess this could be a pro and/or a con",

None of the faculty or students are still there as far as I know. I'd be surprised if anyone else is continuing the work. It's still advertised on the website, and I think I even saw an old picture of it in one of the magazines FIT sent out recently.\n\nI'm also not a big fan of Melbourne, but I'm still here after all these years due to the job opportunities. Some people love Melbourne though because it's not too crowded and cheaper than living in a bigger city.",

            "comment": "Former FIT student here, had to drop out 3/4 of the way through a BSEE when the school stopped remote access for classes.  I have family members who are at very high risk for covid, which means I can't risk spending time in face-to-face classroom situations, which means my impressions of FIT life really date from before the pandemic started.  Also, they just got a new president, so some things may change now.  That said....\n\nFIT is a great school, and I loved my time there.  Other than being seriously annoyed / disappointed at the administrators who basically forced out any student with health concerns--or family members with health concerns--by ending remote access while covid is still a thing, I was very impressed by the availability and helpfulness of professors and staff there.  I got my first BS (in another field) from a large state university where you are just a number and it was common for administrative errors to occur that would take hours of standing in lines and getting signatures to clean up, or for your academic advisor to stand you up for appointments you'd made with them, and similar things to go on.  It often felt like the university was intentionally throwing obstacles in my path.  FIT was a whole different experience, far superior, and if some real solution to the covid situation is ever found I will go back and finish my degree there in a heartbeat.\n\nMy classmates were awesome and amazing people.  I was seriously impressed with them and would say that the student body there is an order of magnitude better than my old classmates at the big state university. Not only incredibly smart and accomplished, but really nice people, too.  \n\nFacilities are mostly very good.  Some of the equipment in some of the labs has seen better days, I will admit.  In fairness, I'm sure it's not easy to keep equipment that's used by a bunch of students semester after semester in perfect working order.\n\nThere's a large international student population there, so you definitely won't feel alone.  \n\nThe school has an excellent reputation locally, so if you plan to stay in Florida and work here after you graduate, that would be a plus.  Not sure how much of the reputation carries over to the country where you live, however.  Excellent networking opportunities, too, but the same thing applies:  not sure how much it would help you if you're not going to stay and work locally, or at least in the U.S.\n\nTuition:  Really, really expensive.  If you're paying your own way, that's got to be a concern.\n\nAs for Melbourne, well, it's a small city, so if you're used to big city life, you may find it lacking.  Or you might feel very comfortable here--depends on what you're used to.  The beach is great, there's warm weather and sunshine, and of course Kennedy Space Center is here.  If you really want the big-city experience, Orlando is 60 miles away, so you can always drive over there for a night out.  Realistically, though, if you're a serious student (which you should be because FIT's classes are quite challenging), you're not going to have all that much time to spend off campus.\n\nI hope this is helpful in making your decision!",

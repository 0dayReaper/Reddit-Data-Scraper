    "postText": "Does anyone know the torrenting policy here? I tend to use torrent downloads whenever I can at home instead of direct downloads, since they are more reliable and generally faster in my experience. But at the same time, I know torrenting tends to be associated with piracy, so I was curious what the school thinks about that.\n\nI looked at the IT policies (specifically the [Acceptable Use](https://policy.fit.edu/Information-Technology/Policies/8421) and [Suspension](https://policy.fit.edu/Information-Technology/Policies/8446) sections) but they don't specifically address torrenting. The only thing kinda close to it is the line \"You may not deliberately waste campus computing and network resources.\"\n\nAny idea, anyone?",

Just make sure whatever you're doing is legal, we can see when it isn't and we have to block your Internet. You get two warnings (each with a timeout period) and you have to come to our office so we can read you our script before it turns back on",

We also monitor to make sure we lock anything infected out of the network, we've seen a couple WannaCry threats recently and we notify the user what's up, and lock that device out until its fixed",

I am based in Melbourne and taking an online class (this school is in Atlanta) that requires me to take proctored exams. Any feedback appreciated! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Just now seeing your question.  I'd imagine you already have an answer by now, but here are a couple more suggestions, JIC someone else is wondering the same thing:\n\n\\--Eastern Florida State College (formerly BCC) has at least one testing center for its own students who are taking online courses.  Students there are required to complete at least one in-person exam per online course, so it's a routine thing for them.  They \\*may\\* even have one on each campus by now--not sure about that.  But you could call the main switchboard and ask.  They might be willing to accommodate you.\n\n\\--Public libraries will often do this for students, so I'd suggest calling the Brevard County Public Library branch closest to you and asking them, too.\n\nBoth of these options will probably involve paying a fee, so I'd agree with the commenter who suggested you start by asking at Florida Tech first.  Their tutoring center does testing for students who get accommodations for learning disabilities, so they're already set up to do this kind of thing, and they may not charge you for it. (Not sure if you're also a Florida Tech student?)\n\nHere's one more sort of wildcard-type idea:  Some schools will allow some other authority figure to proctor an exam for a remote student.  I've heard of a commanding officer doing it for a student who was in the military, or an employer doing it for one of his employees.  One student I know of tried to get the pastor at her church approved as a proctor for her exam.  Her school denied that request on the grounds that proctors had to have academic or professional affiliations, but if you have no other options, you can always ask your school about someone like this and see what they say.\n\nAnd there's always ProctorU or similar companies.  Not the cheapest option, I know, but a possibility.",

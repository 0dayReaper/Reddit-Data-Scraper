The classes at FIT were much smaller, which I liked.\n\nI enjoyed most of the classes. It's basically a degree in IT. The classes are in networking, programming, and databases.\n\nMy only criticism would be the same as I have with my undergrad program. Universities seem to be stuck on using Java and C. (I know why Java and C are used in classes; because it's assumed if you understand Java and C, you can pick up most other languages.)",

I learned some C++ when I was a CS major for a semester-ish during the pandemic. I was planning on learning some relevant languages over the summer. Also, how do you view the job prospects?",

If you're looking at getting into another field in IT like networking, cybersecurity, or database admin, then CIS is better.\n\nIf you have no programming experience, you're definitely going to have to work harder.",

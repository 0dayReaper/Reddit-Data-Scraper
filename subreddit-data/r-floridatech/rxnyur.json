    "postText": "Hello again, I had emailed financial aid yesterday morning this question but they haven't responded... Wanting to see if anyone here knows. \n\nI'm a little confused on how I know how much Financial aid I have towards paying for my textbooks? I can't seem to find where I'd discover that information... first timer at F.I.T., coming from EFSC and EFSC normally had a book voucher announcement when we log into our student account. I tried to look through PAWS under the Financial aid tab but I can't seem to find anything specifically about the amount towards textbooks.\n\nAny help would be appreciated if anyone knows, or I'll just wait for their email...",

They'll load a credit on your ID card in the form of \"panther cash\". \nIf you can front it, you're much better off just paying out of pocket elsewhere, then end up reimbursed by the refund check.",

    "postText": "Sorry to repost this, but we would really like a tour guide if possible. My daughter (HS Junior) and I will be on campus Saturday afternoon, hopefully around 4pm. If someone is available to take us around campus and give us their take on their experience at FIT that would be awesome. We would pay $50 + dinner after if you have the time. DM me if you are interested.",

            "comment": "Here's an unorthodox answer. Call the student life office. (321) 674-8080. Tell them what you're looking for and explain the situation. Chances are there will be someone available looking for Campus Service Hours (if that's still a thing). Bit of a grey area due to \"dirty recruiting\" but you could also try and reach out to the Sororities. Most of Greek Life (Fraternities &amp; Sororities) is part of the Orientation Team and are happy to give an impromptu tour. The student life office is made up of the Florida Tech super fans and they'd bend over backwards to show off the school.",

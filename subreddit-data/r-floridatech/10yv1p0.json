    "postText": " I received a 50% merit scholarship for AE.  I have recently been reading posts from other students/previous students saying that they received the same (and many others do too) and that the school makes it almost impossible to keep your scholarship past the first year by failing the majority of the STEM students and the remaining relying heavily on the curve to pass.  How true is this?\n\nFIT is my dream program, but I am scared to risk losing my other options (other merit scholarships at other colleges), losing my scholarship, and getting such a low GPA that I could not transfer to a reputable program from there.  Please share your experiences/opinions!  TIA!",

They all honestly deserved to lose their scholarships- skipped class all the time, didn't study effectively, and didn't turn in assignments on time. There are some engineering classes that curve to a C average, but not that many in reality (most classes just don't curve much if at all). Unless you plan to be a major slacker, I wouldn't be too worried about this. I did finish my BS/MS a few years ago but I doubt they suddenly started failing everyone all of a sudden.",

Just expect a few courses to be pretty challenging and make sure you go to office hours for help when needed (and don't expect to keep a 4.0 GPA more than maybe a semester or two). A few of my friends really struggled with intro to aerospace and most people struggled with things like PDE, but things should even out overall.",

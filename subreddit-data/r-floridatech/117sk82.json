The ratio may seem skewed but the fact remains most guys stay in their dorm/off campus house playing video games, going to class and that's it. Take care of yourself and don't dress like a complete slob and you'll do fine.",

Just take care of your hygiene, don't be a jerk (or act like you're God's gift to womankind) and get involved in clubs and activities you enjoy. And don't totally slack off in class or act super immature.",

The girl I dated while at FIT was an EFSC student.\n\nYou'll likely have better luck meeting someone on a dating app or off campus somewhere like Downtown Melbourne instead of on campus.",

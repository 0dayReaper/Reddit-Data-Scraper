            "comment": "I'm surprised the museum survived this long. The few times I visited it, it was dead.\n\nThe shows the museum has are nice, but the building is terrible. Downtown Eau Gallie is also depressing.\n\nI'd drop the museum if I were FIT. I don't see it ever becoming a major attraction without a big investment. The museum needs a much larger facility to house a permanent collection and to host more varied types of art.\n\nEven with a fancy new building, the City of Melbourne is poorly managed. There's no reason for anyone from out of town to come here. There are no major attractions and the city doesn't seem to have any long-term vision to greatly improve the area. Even the art museum was incredible, it would do poorly due to the lack of other activities.\n",

The roads are in horrible condition around here despite the counties revenue growth every year.\n\nThey seem to be using our money for tax breaks for big corporations like Northrup and Blue Origin which is not a sustainable system. These companies are well funded and can easily pack up and move elsewhere after their tax breaks expire. The tax breaks need to stop and the city needs to be naturally attractive to companies.\n\nThe area has a branding problem. \"Space Coast\" is a marketing gimmick. No one knows what the Space Coast is outside of this area. Other cities try to promote nicknames like this (eg, Treasure Coast and Gold Coast) because they have no other claim to fame or identifiable city.\n\nI think merging municipalities would help save money and give the area an identity. If Palm Bay, Melbourne, Melbourne Beach, and the other small towns were merged it could save money. It would also create a larger, more populated area similar in size to Orlando. Maybe we wouldn't have to tack \"Orlando\" onto our airport's name if Melbay (or whatever it would be called) was a major city.\n\nWe also have a weak downtown and no city centers. Downtown Melbourne is quaint but the businesses have to keep the noise down due to all of the nearby houses. Downtown Melbourne cannot be the night spot for the area.\n\nI'd like to see the Melbourne Mall and Priemer Oaks area turned into a lifestyle center that could be popular at night. The mall should be converted to an outdoor mall. They need to make everything more walkable though. The new restaurants they added outside the mall are nice, but they aren't connected by any walkways so it doesn't encourage people to explore the area.\n\nFIT is important to the area as well. Companies like to move to areas where they have a nearby source of educated workers. They also like having a place to send their employees for additional schooling.\n\nI don't expect the county or city to make concessions to FIT, but they could help FIT by making the roads nicer. I'd like to see the utilities moved underground along Babcock and other roads around FIT. It would make the campus look better.\n\nFIT needs the city to provide a pedestrian bridge or tunnel under Babcock too. I'd prefer a tunnel if it's possible since pedestrian bridges are usually ugly. Crossing Babcock is dangerous. I'm amazed more students don't get hurt. It would also be used by the elementary school students.\n\nThere is a golf course near FIT that's owned by Melbourne. It's pretty shabby. If FIT could create a plan to redevelop the golf course, the city could transfer ownership to FIT. A nicer golf course could benefit the area. The clubhouse is an eyesore. I'd build a new one with a restaurant. The golf course could also be used by the golf team.",

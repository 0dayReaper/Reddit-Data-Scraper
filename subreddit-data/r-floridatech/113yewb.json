    "postText": "Recently visited Melbourne for the first time in many years. I reached out to the Alumni Office to see what might be available in terms of tours of new buildings etc and was pleasantly surprised. Most of the office was at the DC Alumni event but the staff still in town spent a great deal of time catching up with me and making me feel welcome to revisit campus.  \n\nJust wanted to share the overwhemingly positive experience with my fellow alumni and encourage all to reach out to the Alumni Office should they find themselves back in Melbourne on a random weekday.",

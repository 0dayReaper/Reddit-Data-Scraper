If your personal router isn't working you'll want to register it on https://gatekeeper.fit.edu (only loads on PanthAir/campus computers). Feel free to call (321) 674-7284 on Monday for any assistance or questions",

What isn't allowed is creating a loop that takes down a building's internet by introducing another DHCP server so as long as we don't see that your router should work. It's necessary if you want things like Chromecasts to work as intended",

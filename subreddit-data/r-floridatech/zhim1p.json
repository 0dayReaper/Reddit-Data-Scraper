But we are not limiting membership of course to people with CVD so if you are not you are still welcome to join. The plan is to spread awareness of it as a club dedicated to it because I'm afraid if we combine it we will weaken the messaging.",

I would contact them about starting a student chapter or contact them about making the first student chapter anywhere. Having an official affiliation outside of FIT would strengthen the club and attract more members. An outside organization might even provide you with extra funding.",

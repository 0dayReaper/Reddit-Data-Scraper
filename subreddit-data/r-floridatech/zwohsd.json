    "postText": "hello! i\u2019m currently a first-year student at the george washington university in washington, d.c. short story short, the university isn\u2019t really what i expected and d.c. in general isn\u2019t somewhere that i can see myself being longterm. i just feel like there aren\u2019t enough activities that cater to my interests. with that being said, i\u2019m getting quiet bored. i\u2019m really interested in possibly transferring to FIT but i have some questions / concerns and overall would just like to hear about current student\u2019s (or if you\u2019re alumni) experiences. i already sent an email to the school but won\u2019t be expecting a reply back until the 3rd of january so i wanted to connect with people here to see if anyone had any thoughts or any information that can potentially calm my nerves \n\n1. i am really interested in double-majoring astronomy and astrophysics and something business-related. is this possible to do? if not i\u2019ll definitely go with astronomy and astrophysics but if i could double-major that would be great\n\n2. when i looked at the transfer acceptance rate or the estimates transfer acceptance rate it was pretty low. should i be concerned? is there anything that i should do in the meantime at my current school to increase my chances of getting in to FIT when i do go to apply? \n\n3. what is the likelihood of my credits from my current school transferring? are there certain classes / are there a certain amount of credit hours that i should take next semester to prepare myself for when i go to apply?\n\nthese most likely aren\u2019t all of the questions that i have but they\u2019re the only ones that i could think of off the top of my head \u2026i am super interested in making friends with people that are currently there now though and hearing about people\u2019s different experiences so please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me with any guidance, advice, or anything in general for that matter &lt;3333",

You could do it online and your company might even pay for it.\n\nIf you're bored in DC, I'm not sure where you will be happy. Melbourne has beaches and a small downtown with some bars. But there are a lot of aerospace companies around here that may have more opportunities for you.",

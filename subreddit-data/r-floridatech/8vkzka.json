    "postText": "Hi, just thought I would share what happened to me in case someone else has had a similar experience:\n\nBasically, I had registered for online classes and attempted to pay via debit card online. I got an error message and an email confirmation stating that my payment could not be processed after I hit submit. I figured I must have mis-typed a number or something so I entered my debit card information again and hit submit...same error message. \n\nI tried one more time in case I made another error entering in my card information (I figured I was OK since it was saying my card couldn't be charged) and same results. I decided maybe their payment system was having issues so I decided to call the next morning and speak to someone.\n\nSo,  before I called this morning I checked my account to make sure nothing went through (even though I got emails saying essentially my card couldn't be charged)...Lo and behold 1,045.00 was taken out of my account 3 times instead of just once, effectively decimating my account. I had a approximately 3,000 in my account when I attempted to pay, so the money was in there for sure, especially since they were able to take an extra 2,090.00\n\nI spoke to someone in ABA registration and she was saying it was probably pending charges, etc.  I told her no, they had all gone through so she told me to send a screen shot of my account statement showing the charges as well as the type of debit card with the last 4 digits and the expiration date. I'm currently waiting on a response from them but man, that 3,135.00 charge put me in the negative and I have bills to pay so they need to get back to me ASAP\n\nHas anyone else had an experience like this?",

On campus students won't have any issue on their account but the whole Continuing Education department just feels tacked on.  \n\nEdit: If anyone in the ABA course has any tech support questions, you'll have better luck contacting abasupport@fit.edu rather than the tech support line. We're not set up to manage your accounts. ",

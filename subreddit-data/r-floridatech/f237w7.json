    "postText": "I come from a low-income household, so, when it comes to colleges, affordability is a big thing for me. I'm hoping to not take out any loans if at all possible because that would probably only put more stress on me. How affordable was this university for you guys? If you are also from a low-income household, how much money in financial aid were they willing to give you? Is this school more affordable than other Florida universities? What scholarships does the school offer?",

            "comment": "FIT is a great college, but it is very expensive.\n\nI am from a low-income household and I took out around 90k in loans to cover all four years including tuition, housing, and books.\n\nIf you're wanting to save money, your best bet is to spend at least a year getting your general education classes at a cheaper university then transferring to FIT for your core curriculum.\n\nThat said, manageable debt is an asset.  If you can take out a few thousand dollars in loans to get a more recognizable degree in a field that is highly employable, it shouldn't put too much of a burden on you to repay them in the end.  I repaid my loans by aggressively tackling them for 6 years after college by strictly sticking to a budget and taking every opportunity to earn a bit extra money.  /r/personalfinance helped me set up the most effective loan repayment plan I could afford.\n\nWebsites like https://www.fastweb.com/ are really good for locating and applying to scholarships and grants, and FIT's financial aid office would be able to offer you more information about FIT's own scholarship offerings.",

I still end up paying 4k a semester from money I made at work. (This may be more for you since I was able to skip out on housing and meal plans because I am local.)  \n  \nI didn't try hard enough for scholarships, and looking back I definitely should have and suggest others do. There are resources online to find them and it isn't as much about what the school accepts but rather who offers them.   \n  \nUnfortunately it is expensive but being in the Software Engineering and seeing the other Florida school's programs I think I made the right choice.  \n  \n  \nEdit: Not to say other schools aren't good! I just like the atmosphere here at a smaller, engineering focused school",

Even if you land a full scholarship for tuition somewhere, you have to pay for your living expenses (house, food, car, etc).\n2. If you're sensitive to price, then living at home and going to community college is the best financial move you can make. It's not going to be as fun though. Living at home can be boring and not much happens on-campus at community colleges.\n3. FIT gives a lot of small scholarships. I received a decent scholarship and the price of attending FIT was only a little more than going to a public school. There are some people at FIT who pay full price or almost full price. Usually they're the ones who get angry when the graduate and the reality of their loans set in. Truthfully, if someone paid full price or nearly full price at FIT, they probably didn't have any other great offers (their grades or test scores weren't great).",

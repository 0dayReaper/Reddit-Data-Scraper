Looking at their resumes, it's interesting they're all engineers.\n\nThe only candidate who seems odd to me is Nicklow. I'm not sure why he wants to move from UNO to FIT. FIT and UNO are fairly similar. It's a lateral move. The only reason to move is for a raise or he thinks he might be pushed out soon at UNO.",

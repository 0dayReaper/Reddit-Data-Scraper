It would be an incredibly easy way for people like me to interact with the community.  \nThanks in advance  \nEdit: I feel like an online community would be crucial if E-Sports were to become a bigger thing, and would hate to see E-Sports fail due to a lack of online interaction between students, alumni, and faculty.",

I'm not aware of any online community that spans the entire University but every club has active social media and discord servers and such. But a lot of communication occurs face to face since it's a close-knit student body.\nEdit: also we have a subreddit! Which is clearly the best",

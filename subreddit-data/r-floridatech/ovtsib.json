This seems to be the only reliable place I can find information, so I thank you all for the help!\n\nI got the emails about the school bookstore and that my textbooks are ready, however I noticed theres no way to buy the books with financial aid or similar. Do I get reimbursed if using my own credit card? \n\nTheres a lot of information thats not being presented directly to students, and I am hoping during orientation they tell me everything like where my classes are (I have the map, but no idea where the classes are in the buildings), what I need for classes, etc etc.",

The entire system is built to take as much money as possible from you. Get your books secondhand, if you can. It will save you hundreds of dollars a semester. \n\nIf you have a map, you have the tools you need. Your schedule will tell you what room number the classes are in, and from there you're an adult and should have no trouble finding them. \n\nYour instructors will (mostly) lay out what you need for class in the syllabus and provide further detail on the first day of class.",

There's a good chance you won't need half of the textbooks they require on the syllabus.",

The dorms are only accessible to people who live in them. Offices, labs and some classrooms are kept locked unless someone is in them. Wandering around campus and into the buildings your classes are in is fine. Nobody will \"question you\" unless you look lost, in which case they will help you find where you want to go. There are people in the Florida Tech commons building who can direct you to where things are.",

LibGen is an excellent resource!\n\nThe bookstore is the worst place to buy, Amazon has some decent used book deals. \n\nAs far as finding classes, I recommend taking a day and walking through your schedule and ask around for help from other students.",

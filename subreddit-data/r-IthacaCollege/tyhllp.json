I think you can also pay up front but I\u2019m not sure. \n\nThere\u2019s a pretty pond by Muller chapel that\u2019s nice to see, but with the current weather, I can\u2019t promise it\u2019ll be pleasant haha. But it\u2019s lovely on a sunny day. There are also a lot of good views of the lake on campus. Above the fountains is one good spot!",

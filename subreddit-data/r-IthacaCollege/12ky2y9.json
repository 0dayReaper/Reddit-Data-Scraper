I\u2019m using a service to help pay my bills \u2014 only for graduation weekend. The housing market sucks - or has been pushing people out of downtown - because of a few reasons. Those huge new luxury apt buildings on the commons (I know of 3) created serious issues bc they were charging NYC prices, and then Cornell paid it for their grad students since they have a housing issue. There\u2019s a man named Jason Fane who owns tons of buildings - a huge percentage of Ithaca \u2014 and lets the commercial ones (such as shops) sit empty \u2014 to claim them as losses on his taxes. He fucked over some of my friends who got loans to pay for a renovation in one of his business buildings \u2014 he found a way to evict them. The gentrification of Ithaca has been happening more seriously for over 10 years, it was planned. The geography doesn\u2019t help. There are new housing initiatives happening and a lot of landlords accept section 8. (Btw - I got to IC 15 years ago and usually paid under $500 to rent an apt room downtown or on south hill.)",

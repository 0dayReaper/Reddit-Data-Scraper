Ten dollars gets you dinner and treats, funky music, and of course fun trivia. Come on your own or bring a team of up to five and try your best. There will be prizes for the winning teams! PM me if you need more information, or just show up at the cafeteria by 6!\n\nThe Brain Team has had an outstanding year in academic quizbowl tournaments both locally and in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, with several tournament wins.  Our A team also made its first appearance at a college-level tournament at the University of Pennsylvania in the fall, where they finished the tournament with a 6-6 record and wins against teams from Cornell, Penn State, Columbia, and VCU.  Overall, the team is [ranked 3rd in the state and 53rd in the world](https://hsqbrank.com/2016/01/08/top-200-high-school-teams-172016/) and has qualified to three nation tournaments in Dallas, Chicago, and Washington DC, the first of which is next weekend!  The expenses for these tournaments are significant - we've already spent $3000 in registration, transportation, and hotels. Our trivia night fundraisers go a long way to helping us cover these expenses, and your financial support is critical in helping us continue to perform at a national level.\n\nThank you very much for your continued support, and we hope to see you on Thursday!\n",

This was during Mizzou\u2019s president being kicked out due to racists things he said. I feel like POC were just pissed at higher education and wanted him gone as well claiming systemic racism. \n\nFast forward and the college wanted to employ a POC\u2026 aka S.Collado. Look how that worked out",

Because he didn't say something about an incident that didn't involve him. It was a popular thing to do in 2016. Maybe it was time for a change but the way it was done was ridiculous.\n\nNew search under way again after wasting tons of the students money all for someone that treated the college like a stepping stone. \n\nGood riddance.",

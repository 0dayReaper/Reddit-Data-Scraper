I meant more like will I become ineligible for certain scholarships or grants at 12-14 credits vs 16-18?",

But i dropped to 12 for consecutive semesters once for the sake of my mental health, took a couple classes over the summer, and it was one of the smartest things i did (and i wasn't working at all at the time). Do what's best for you. Good luck.",

I also got higher grades in all my classes. for me personally i just need to take things at a slower pace",

I believe 12 is considered full time, but you should check. Remember, it is hours that decides what class you are in, so if you aren't taking enough, you could be classified in a lower class than you think you are. Again, it is just my two cents.",

There are one off classes depending on your major that take up a few hours of one or two weekends but that\u2019s the whole class for the semester around some writing work, if the regular weekly schedule doesn\u2019t work for you look for those classes and other 1 credit one off seminars to fluff up/fill out the gaps in your schedule",

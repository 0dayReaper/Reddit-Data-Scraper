We [previously asked reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18x2gr/were_screening_reservoir_dogs_and_pulp_fiction/) what we could do to make it a special screening. In the long run, we hope that we can empower Ithacans (and everyone, really) to host screenings of their own favorite movies at local theaters!\n\nFor more info on the event: www.flicstart.com/special\n",

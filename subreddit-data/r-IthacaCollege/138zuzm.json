This was something I was excited about doing but it seems as though I won\u2019t be able to choose. Could someone help clear this up?",

None of us currently knows that this looks like to give you more of an idea, im sorry. I would advise calling the office of the Registrar, they might have more answers.\n\nThis is an article in the Ithacan about it, unfortunately this is all the information we really have: https://theithacan.org/news/college-to-select-courses-for-fall-2023-incoming-students/",

This is what we received below for a music major. \n\n&gt; In order to set you up for a successful fall semester, our team of academic advising experts will construct a carefully balanced schedule based on your major and interests.\n\n&gt; Your schedule will reflect our best recommendation based on the interests you share and the requirements of your major.

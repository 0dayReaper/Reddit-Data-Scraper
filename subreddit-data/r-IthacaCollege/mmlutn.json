    "postText": "Hi there!\n\nPreface: thanks again to anyone who's answered any of my questions on this sub before; y'all are too nice!!\n\nI'm an incoming student for Fall 2021, and I have some questions about dorm room policies and regulations. I've read through all the [rules](https://www.ithaca.edu/policy-manual/volume-vii-students/75-residential-life/752-rules-and-regulations), but I just wanted some clarification about some things. Some questions are tech-related so mind the jargon :)\n\nFirstly, the regulation page says there is a wattage limit for PCs at the college, and I'm concerned slightly about that. Right now the setup that I have runs on a 750W power supply (spec: r7 2700x, rtx 2070). Would you even recommend bringing a PC to college? I'm not really sure how that would even go down fitting on the desk. I've looked through some residential life photos, and, as far as I can see, the desks seem to vary in size and shape a fair bit. I guess it's the alternative to a gaming console for me, as I'm not really into console.\n\nHow's the internet at the college? I saw some say that there was ethernet in almost every dorm, but how fast is it? Most colleges hover around 100mbps, so is it around there? I saw on the webpage that there is an upgrade option for wireless service, so that's slightly concerning (giving me that hotel wifi vibe). Would anyone recommend an ethernet switch (a.k.a. is there just one port per dorm)?\n\nAny answer, no matter how small, is always appreciated :)",

Probably a bit overkill, but when you\u2019ve got a $1500 piece of tech out in the open it never hurts to be too careful.",

I personally kept my pc on the floor and just had screens  for the dust and making sure it had enough clearance for psu intake obviously. That being said you can play with the furniture and easily find an elevated place. \n\nThe internet is fine, I would even say good compared to some of my friends at other colleges. DO NOT pay for the upgrade, the upgrade really only allows you to connect more than 10 devices to the wifi.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m currently on campus, I was a bit worried about my PC as well since I have a 500W power supply, ultimately I brought it and haven\u2019t had any issues, and talking to some students in the esports club they said they\u2019ve never heard of any issues with power supplies. As for internet, I just ran several speed tests on my pc and it averages out around 62 mbs, not the best, but it\u2019s not bad. The only issue I\u2019ve had with internet before is while playing Battlefront, the server delay made it difficult (but not impossible) to play. Otherwise I\u2019ve had absolutely no issues! Regarding space, if you have difficulty making space on your desk for your PC, the shelf that comes on it can be taken off, I put mine on the floor alongside my bed and I have plenty of room for my PC!",

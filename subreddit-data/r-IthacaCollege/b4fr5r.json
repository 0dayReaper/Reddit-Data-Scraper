    "postText": "Incoming student potentially for an one semester exchange, are there any dorm recommendations? I know the quads have been mentioned as good dorms, but are non-freshmen able to live there? Also can't seem to find information on the cost for the dorms or if Ithaca has rates for only one semester so if someone could direct me to the right place for information that would be amazing. Thank you! ",

All of my internships were possible because of my campus experience and networking with alumni. \n\nSee if admissions can connect you with other students or alumni, if you\u2019re still deciding on IC. \n\nYou can also listen to this podcast about one of the key IMC professors: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/breakenter",

            "comment": "i would say IMC is one of the few degrees that are actually worth the price. the alumni network is incredible and IC really opened a ton of doors for me. \n\nI went to a tiny public school in massachusetts, my parents were a teacher and a social worker, i had no network or connections to speak of. while at IC i was in the american advertising federation club (we renamed it Park AdVenue), through that I was able to get an internship in media buying in NYC the summer going into senior year. I was placed at an agency and had an amazing summer, they actually asked me if i could graduate early to come back and join them. I wasn't able to graduate early, but they did offer me a job after graduation. I went back and was there for a year, then got a job at reddit in monetization because of my experience at the agency, and while I was at reddit I met the founder of a startup in the ad tech space, left reddit to join the startup when it was \\~10 people, and now 7 years later i'm a VP, running a team of 22 and we're over 120 total. \n\nSo, I know my experience isn't quite typical, but i truly credit a great deal of my success to the IMC program. Thats not to say if you are an IMC grad you're automatically going to have doors open, i worked my ass off to get there, but it really worked out super well for me. happy to answer questions if you have any.",

Many have moved on to higher profile roles in the field or bigger client accounts in the 5 years since graduating too. The IC alumni network is invaluable!",

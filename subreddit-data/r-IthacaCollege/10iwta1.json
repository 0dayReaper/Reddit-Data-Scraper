Any double major will certainly be tighter for how many courses you have to take each semester and your workload to stay on schedule, but should be fine if you're up for that.",

I didn't add the computer science major until my sophomore year, and at that point I wouldn't have been able to graduate on time if I did the BS because it required a few more lab science courses. But the core computer science classes were basically the same, so it wasn't an issue.",

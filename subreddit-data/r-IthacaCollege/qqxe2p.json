    "postText": "Have any current students applied EA to Ithaca College? if so, when did you find out your admission decision? I applied to IC at the end of September for EA and still haven't heard.  My counselor said that they usually post decisions pretty quickly as more of a rolling admission.  Let me know if anyone has any insight into this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks",

There even used to be a real pub along with real actual greek life.   \n It's unfortunate what was then and what is now don't add up. Maybe if they did, that alumni donation rate wouldn't be below the national average.   \nI wonder what happened between 2011 and 2014 that caused it to drop so much...",

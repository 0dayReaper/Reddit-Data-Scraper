    "postText": "Hi all, I'm looking for responses from current students/alumni. For context, I'm a high school senior and Ithaca College is my top pick for colleges right now ( I'll be majoring within the Park School).  I'm from California and have never been to NY state/ Ithaca, so I really want to learn more about the vibe of Ithaca (the town and college). How would you describe the general atmosphere of the campus and the students? Are concerts/ the music scene big there? I love going to concerts and house shows so this is important to me haha. Do lots of ppl smoke? Ya know, just asking all the important questions. Alright, thanks!",

The downtown is absolutely poppin and there are a lot of campus bands that will play at different venues down there. Also, I went to a LOT of house shows in college (you gotta befriend the music majors). Also if you take the vowels out of Ithaca it\u2019s just THC \ud83d\ude0e that should tell you everything you need to know about the smoking situation lol. Overall, lot\u2019s of super artsy kids. I met some of the coolest people ever at IC and made some lifelong friends. If you\u2019re into the music scene, go to IC and either befriend music majors or become one yourself :) I had the absolute time of my life!\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe girlfriend of a music major alum who played bass in a band \u2764\ufe0f",

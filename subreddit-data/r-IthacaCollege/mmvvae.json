Just curious as I've searched the website and nothing really came up for bathrooms/hygiene. Opinions on the bathrooms would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Nothing concrete yet, but I heard that next year they're planning on putting all the freshmen in lower quads, which is where I currently live. There's a bathroom for each floor of each wing, so you share a bathroom with about 6-8 other rooms, so like 12-15 other people depending on how many singles/empty rooms there are. The bathrooms are alright (I would definitely wear shower sandals in them though), and the cleanliness of the bathroom depends whether the people you share it with. Lyon Hall I know has 2 stalls, 3 sinks, and 2 showers(with doors). There's hot water, although for some reason the water pressure in my building is so high that it's like going through a car wash",

            "comment": "As a freshman, you\u2019ll be living in either the towers or the quads. In quads are one bathroom per side of the floor (usually the floors are separated via gender but I was on a mixed gender floor my freshman year). These bathrooms have around two sinks, two toilets, and two showers (every bathroom is different tho). In towers, there are gender neutral/individual bathrooms meaning one shower, toilet, and sink in a room that locks. My opinion on the bathrooms- yeah they\u2019re alright. I\u2019ve noticed mold was an issue both my freshman and sophomore year in the showers but as long as your floor is respectful of the bathroom they\u2019ll remain clean along with daily cleanings from janitors.",

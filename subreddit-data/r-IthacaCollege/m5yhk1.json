    "postText": "I\u2019m still deciding on what college I\u2019m going  to this fall but at the moment Ithaca is my first choice, mainly because I got into their Theatre Arts Management program and being one of the 10 people they choose every year I think it\u2019s a big opportunity for me. \n\nI have made my research and noticed all the problems Ithaca is having right now but is the Theatre Program still worth it? I know they have one of the best programs in the US but I\u2019m still not sure if I should. Any thoughts?",

If you were thinking about IC for something like business or writing or something - then I\u2019d say go somewhere else. But, Dillingham is the best for what you\u2019re looking for. \n\nTo add to what greyladyghost said, yes IC is laying off a ton of faculty this year due to a major deficit (which I think is important to add began with the former president of the college that resigned in 2017). Every small liberal arts school in the country is going through this and the cuts will hit us hard in the fall. I don\u2019t think this will impact your experience if you were to come here. TAM will not be cut until things are absolutely dire, and that will probably not happen (if ever) during your 4 years here. \n\nThe administration is hoping that post-pandemic more people will apply and attend IC and will fix the budget issues. I know some schools already have plans to rehire laid off professors if budgets get expanded within the next 3 years.\n\nTLDR: things at IC are not black and white, and I encourage you to reach out to current TAM students on fb or Instagram to hear about their first hand experience at the program.",

No program is safe right now",

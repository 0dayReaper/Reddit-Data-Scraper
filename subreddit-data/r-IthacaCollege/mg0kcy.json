            "comment": "No one is going to chime in, really? \n\nThe communications school is good. It's a *little* overhyped, to be honest. Is it worth it, financially? I don't think so. Are you a Park Scholar on a potential full ride? Go, for sure. But I say all of this as someone who graduated from Park over 10 years ago but has been back on campus and in contact with people there regularly. It isn't bad, but it comparable to a lot of other schools. It's nothing special.\n\nThere are very different programs in Park and each one is clique-y. It felt like a strange continuation of high school, when I was there. That might be appealing, it might not. Some students take their work way too seriously and don't venture outside of Park enough. \n\nThe biggest downside of IC is that faculty seems to come last, in terms of **everything**. As an incoming student, you don't want that. You want faculty up WAY higher in the priorities of the college. So you have some tenured folk who are great, some who are not so great, adjuncts phoning it in, adjuncts busting their ass, and everyone in-between. It's kind of a gamble, to be honest. I had professors who knew less than me and other students on a technical level, in production classes. Not good. Like, how can that be a thing? \n\nBut, it's a safe, open-minded place to make stuff, regularly. You'll get good at your craft. There are a ton of cool ways to collaborate and do stuff outside of class. Critiques are horrible, for a variety of reasons I won't get into. Actually, watch the movie [Art School Confidential](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/art-school-confidential) and I swear half of that movie applies to Park. Whether or not you do anytime with it after graduating is entirely up to you. Sure, network contacts help, but you can't rely on that. Hope this was useful, good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

I was accepted to the Park school for screenwriting/writing for film with a pretty good scholarship, and love Ithaca, but I\u2019m having a huge difficulty choosing between this and a different school in California. It\u2019s super expensive though, sob.\n\nI\u2019m putting together a pro/cons list, and this was really helpful for that! Thanks a ton! &lt;3",

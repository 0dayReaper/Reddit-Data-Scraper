By going to Park you're paying for hands-on experience from day 1, award-winning extra curricular programs, and a powerful alumni network for internships and jobs.",

Since nobody comes to Ithaca to major in Art History (for example) the classes in that major would have like four students in them. When it comes time for a budget cuts they are obviously top of the list. \n\nThose are the people making the most noise.",

Unless you\u2019re hoping to me a musical theater major, you can go to a different school and get the same quality of degree for cheaper and without your professors getting treated like second class citizens by the board of trustees",

I know that\u2019s not what \u201caverage\u201d means, but I think Park grads likely have higher than $30K salaries 5 years out. What\u2019s the source for that stat?",

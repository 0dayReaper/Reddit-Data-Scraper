I'm not trying to say that Kristin isn't suffering, or that this doesn't suck, but rather that it might not be the degree specifically that is causing problems (as the title seems to insinuate). It is unfortunately common for people to blame bad economic situations on the victims, so I advise you not to say \"well you shoulda been an engineer\" -- if everybody did that, we'd have engineers at the food banks, too.",

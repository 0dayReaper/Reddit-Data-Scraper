    "postText": "I feel when I am here the cost is far too much for what I am offered. The small size leads to less resources, the students outside of park and the performing arts all seem to me as dull, average students who really don't care about school all too much, and partying is the only things there to do on the weekends, there are very few worthwhile events put on by the campus, and many of the professors I have interacted with feel on par or less than with my high school teachers as opposed to what I expected (save for General Psych that class has been very good so far) would be a step up. For the price tag of this school I feel almost as if I am involved in a scam than a place of personal growth. What is there here that would possibly change my mindset.",

            "comment": "As an alum ('07) my recommendation for any expensive college, especially IC, is to do a CC or state school for 2 years first and then transfer in. It is a great education, but the price tag is still hurting me to this day. You are still only a bit into the year, but if you are really unhappy try a cheaper option for awhile first. No reason to make an expensive commitment now. \n\nPS the small class sizes will be in your favor in junior and senior years. The resources are better allocated toward those classes as well.",

                    "comment": "Seconded. I did community college first and honestly, I enjoyed my time at my community college more than I did IC. I wouldn't commit to a college with a tuition like ICs without being absolutely certain this is the school for you. I'm not going to lie, after having graduated, I still feel a small twinge of remorse. I feel like IC didn't challenge me in the right ways for my field. Not naming programs, but I do know that there are some programs at IC that leave people feeling unfulfilled and underprepared for their fields.\n\nI'm not going to convince OP why they shouldn't transfer because Ithaca College is *not* the best college, and I know this is a month old, but who knows, maybe another student with the same thoughts will read this. If you are questioning whether or not IC is right for you, make sure to do and ask the following:\n\nDo you have a career path solidified? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? If no, then maybe consider community college. You can explore a number of fields and programs for free in some cases. CC is not lesser quality education, you just can't get past 200 level classes. Many of my CC professors taught or now teach at universities. If you do know what you want to do, how does IC rank in colleges for that field? You can google 'best colleges for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'. Google those colleges and maybe type in 'Such and such University program freshmen' and see what students of your same year are doing at those colleges. If IC isn't on the list, and the students are doing far greater things than you and your peers, maybe reconsider IC as your college. You want a college that will challenge you in the right ways.\n\nI understand that friends, parties, and fun events are part of the college experience, and no matter how shitty a college is one will never regret those moments, but first and foremost, you are here to invest in your education, resources, and opportunities to further your skillset and knowledge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "My advice is try and join some clubs so you get to know a wider variety of the people that go here. Yeah the price is high but as a senior the past 3 years have been some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in my life and it\u2019s been because of the people I\u2019ve met at Ithaca. If you don\u2019t have anything to do I highly suggest getting a group of friends together and hiking through the natural lands back behind campus or taking a trip to second dam before it gets too cold. Finding clubs is going to be something that really helps you settle into life on campus though, they introduce you to people outside your major and people you might not ever talk to otherwise. As for the professors it can be hit or miss, I\u2019ve had some of the most engaging professors in the world and some who didn\u2019t care whether or not you came to class, but you should always go to office hours as much as you can, it will help you out more than you know. I can recommend some professors to look for if you\u2019d like! Also if you\u2019re into it we have great sporting events on the weekends and the atmosphere there is always pretty fun as long as it\u2019s not too cold.",

Another entrance is the far corner of the upper Tower\u2019s parking lot, and then behind Boothroyd Hall there\u2019s another entrance that isn\u2019t technically the natural lands but it\u2019s a great place to hike. Second dam is off campus though, the best way to get to that is using google maps, the easiest way to get there is off of Kendall Ave or Pennsylvania Ave though. ",

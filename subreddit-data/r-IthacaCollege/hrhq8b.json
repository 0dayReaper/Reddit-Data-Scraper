            "comment": "Background: I came to IC in 2018 for the exploratory program, and quickly declared as a CS major. I had started doing some minimal CS in high school.\n\nI found the Professors to be absolutely fantastic, all of them are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable people who are always happy to talk about anything to do with CS. The classes are fairly small and personable, I usually knew most of the people in my classes and the professor always knew my name and how I was doing in class. \n\nUltimately though I transferred to The University of Rochester for this coming year. I found the classes to be a little slow. the professors are great at making sure everyone is on the same page, and no one leaves a class confused. However, this came at the cost of some of the more in depth detail. As I progressed into my sophomore year I found that I was falling farther and farther behind my friends at other colleges. I would take the same class as my friends at other schools, but come it of it with just less knowledge. This is not necessary the end of th world, the professors really are fantastic and are happy to work with you on extra curricular projects. But I found it hard to motivate myself to go that extra mile.\n\nBeyond that I found the social like in CS to be a bit lacking. There was a CS club my first year, but when the President left the club fizzled out. I never heard anything about an alumni network, but I do believe most CS graduates do land jobs in the field they wanted. There weren\u2019t any job fairs for CS students at Ithaca, which I found frustrating. \n\nOverall Ithaca is a nice place with some really fantastic professors and nice students. The CS program will prepare you for a job. But if you are looking to be really challenged, I\u2019m not sure if Ithaca is the best place. \n \nIf you want to DM me I am happy to talk more about it.",

There is no professional development and not too much industry experience. Sure itll get you a job but not too many other take aways.",

            "comment": "I personally would not unless the cost is comparable to your other options. Many classes do not get through core material as the courses cater to the lowest denominator. Despite this I thoroughly enjoyed every professor I worked with. They had significant knowledge in various realms and learning from them was the highlight of my time at Ithaca. It just sucks you rarely get to learn interesting and valuable things from them as the majority of the major can\u2019t set up an IDE or use Git. If you are coming to Ithaca with any prior experience or expertise in CS you might find the curriculum less rigorous than desired. This coupled with the high cost tarnished the experience for me. You should definitely still consider Ithaca just based on how amazing of a college town it is.",

If you go random you'll fill out a survey basically saying your lifestyle/living preferences (early riser/night owl/cleanliness/etc.) I'm sure there are preferences on there as well specifically for LGBTQ+ students to ensure their comfort. Joining the incoming class' facebook group is usually how people can find a first year roommate without going random. As for the living situation like bathrooms and things like that, East and west tower have all-gender restrooms on every floor (a private single-person bathroom w toilet/sink/shower) which is where first year students can live (they're also the best dorms in general, highly recommend!), after that for soph/junior/seniors emerson/garden apts/circle apts all have private bathrooms within your room/apt. Ithaca is one of the most welcoming and accepting schools/ there are tons of resources on campus for LGBTQ students so I'm sure whatever your brother needs/prefers will be able to be accommodated! Hope this helps, lmk if you have any other questions :)",

The radio stations and ictv are constantly winning awards (which if you plan to succeed you really must join one or a different cocurricular within the park school. The majors are designed so you learn in class and cement it in one of the orgs) professors are great! And upperclassman Want to teach you things as well so its a great learning environment. As far as summer and after its all about what you put in, the name means something but you have to commit yourself so you have a reel, portfolio ect to show off. (But honestly thats just any tv program) What do you want to do within the major?",

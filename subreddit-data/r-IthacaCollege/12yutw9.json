There is a massive contrast between the students who are talented (usually in the honors program + deans list/oracle society) and the majority that are not \u2014 the former are exasperated by the lack of opportunity that IC simply can\u2019t afford. Some of their most academically driven professors have left, as they prioritize the professors even less. It\u2019s all about $$, because IC operates mostly as a business. Ithaca College is quickly becoming Insular College, and I\u2019m beyond thrilled that I left. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just me, either \u2014 &gt;(more than)20% of the class of 2024 and 2025 left, which is an abysmal retention rate and also exactly why they established the \u2018student success **and retention**\u2019 center \ud83d\udc80 IC won\u2019t exist in the next 20-30 years",

Do they even exist anymore outside of Cheech &amp; Chong? \n\nA lot of the kids at Ithaca come from wealthier homes in the northeast. A lot of parents of college age kids smoke weed on a regular basis in the northeast. \n\nAre you allowed to be a hippie if you both your parents are college educated liberals living in the northeast? \n\nThese are the truly important questions.\n\nPS\u2026 don\u2019t wear a MAGA hat. You will get heckled at the bare minimum.",

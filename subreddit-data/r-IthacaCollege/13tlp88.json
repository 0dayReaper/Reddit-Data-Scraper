    "postText": "It would be accessible via the Discord integration with Ithaca email, though I don't know how many freshman have emails yet. It would generally be mostly chill, with some starter aims of finding roommates and friends. I would join something like the Prism server but that says it's open to \"current students only.\" Just wanna make something where we can communicate over the summer. Gonna be honest even if one person expresses interest I will probably make it",

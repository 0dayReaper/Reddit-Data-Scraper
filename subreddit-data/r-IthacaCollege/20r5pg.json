            "comment": "\u201cThe future of art,\u201d Walsh argued, \u201cis dependent on the re-emergence of open struggle, mass opposition to capitalism. The filmmakers and writers, and certainly the younger generation, have not seen mass struggle for decades. When American and European workers erupt by the millions \u2026 it will have an enormous impact on art. It will turn artists once again to the big questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are opposing the conceptions that have long dominated academic life. I wanted to discuss what we consider to be central questions in my talk. Understanding history is a big issue. It is not possible to go forward until significant sections of the population understand where we are. Masses of people are unhappy, but they don\u2019t see an alternative. We believe one of the principal tasks of artists is to understand what happened in the 20th Century.\u201d\n\n(quotes from David Walsh at his Wayne State University presentation)",

I don\u2019t know how it compares to Eastman or NEC, but considering that IC is more music education based than performance, I would expect Eastman or NEC to be better. Overall, we sound pretty good most of the time, and I think our performances usually go well. If you want to listen, you can find recordings of previous concerts on the IC website in the music archive. Just so you\u2019re aware, you won\u2019t get to choose which ensemble you\u2019ll be in, as seating auditions will decide that. The wind ensemble I believe is considered the second best ensemble in the music program, with Symphony Orchestra being the best, so you\u2019ve gotta be pretty good to get in. The other groups this year include concert band, opera orchestra, and wind symphony. If you\u2019re looking for a great music education program and a good ensemble experience, I would highly recommend Ithaca. If you\u2019re looking for a great ensemble experience and a good music education program I would recommend Eastman or NEC. If you have any other questions, let me know. Hope this helps!",

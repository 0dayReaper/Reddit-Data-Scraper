    "postText": "The Ithaca High School Brain Team is hosting it's 3rd Annual \"Fall\" Trivia Night Fundraiser this Thursday in the IHS Cafeteria from 6:00 to 9:00.  Tickets are $10 at the door and include a pizza dinner, music, and prizes for the winning team.  Come on your own or bring a group of up to 5 people for a fun night to help support this outstanding group of students!\n\nWho is the Brain Team?  They are an exceptionally talented, diverse group of young men and women who participate in academic quiz competitions both locally and nationally.  This year's team is one of the strongest we've ever had - we have already qualified for national competitions in Chicago and Washington, DC and our \"A\" team has been ranked as [number 52 **in the world**](http://hsqbrank.com/2013/12/13/top-150-quiz-bowl-teams-internationally-12132013/).  The *only thing* that has prevented us from furthering our reputation in national tournaments is money.  With registration, transportation, and hotel/food costs, sending a single team to a single national tournament can cost as much as $2500.  The school district is very generous, but we can't rely on them completely, and these trivia night fundraisers have shown to be very useful towards this goal.  Every dollar we raise goes to tournament registration, transportation costs, and hotel costs for our team and our chaperons.  \n\nPlease come on Thursday and help support our team.  It will be a great night, we promise!",

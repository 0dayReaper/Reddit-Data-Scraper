But all you have to do is be a part of a student org, volunteer once and attend 3 sli events or a retreat for one weekend. Then you just put it on a electronic portfolio and that\u2019s it. You present it each semester at a banquet (only to your table) and they give you food and swag. So you really get like 7k for minimum effort",

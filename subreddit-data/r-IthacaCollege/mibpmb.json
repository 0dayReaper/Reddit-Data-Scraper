One of my professors had a long chat with my class about it and there might have been one or two Park faculty affected by cuts, but they weren't 100% certain. The administration is kind of a mess rn and the school is probably gonna be looking a little different in the next few years, but if you want to come to Park then there's no reason not to rn.",

You will find a faculty and staff more than willing and able to step up to meet the challenges of teaching during a pandemic and institutional restructuring.\n\nFull disclosure; I'm a recent addition to the IC community.",

The cuts are very worrisome and administration refuses to stop them even though there have been many protests. The history department doesn\u2019t seem to be experiencing the cuts (at least I don\u2019t know any professors being cut). Personally, I should have transferred when I could\u2019ve (I\u2019m a junior rn). Keep doing your research about the cuts and how they will affect the park school.",

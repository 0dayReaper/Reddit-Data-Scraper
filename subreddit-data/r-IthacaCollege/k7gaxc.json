The people are supportive but they can also be petty and ill-tempered. Nice folks for sure, some of them just need to chill. In terms of work, there's a lot. It's typical to be stressed out a lot. The professors are great, though, and the community is friendly.",

They recently announced that they would be firing about 200 professors due to the pandemic and for years they've been having fiscal problems. The music program should come through this strong, but the rate of first year students who transfer out is pretty high (the environment isn't compatible with any slacking off and it's a pretty intensive program). In my personal experience, the music school can be a little cliquey but if you have the chops and ability to handle a fast paced and intense learning environment it's not too bad.",

I did meet some people I kind of connected with, however. Like I said, my semester was cut off by covid. But this starkly contrasted to a previous university I was at where I found most people to be kind and connective very quickly. \n\nI got the feeling that there was more of an uptight vibe with people. A somewhat, but maybe loosely fitting analogy would be Spongebob on that episode where he became \u201cnormal\u201d and rounded lol (then again, maybe not *that* bad). I believe a chunk of people tend to have families with more money at Ithaca College (someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this, because I could be very well just jumping to conclusions), but I don\u2019t know if that necessarily has anything to do with it at all, I\u2019m probably just generalizing tbh. I also don\u2019t mean to sound insulting. Me being used to a more cheap state college culture, maybe I just didn\u2019t feel like I fit in personally.\n\nBut yeah, that\u2019s just how I felt. Then again, I\u2019m also a somewhat older student than average who transferred in Junior year as opposed to being a freshman, so take what I say with a grain of salt.",

Ask if you can come observe classes and take a sample lesson. They can put you in touch with current students, too.",

It\u2019s much easier to make friends within your school. Business majors with majors, parkies with parkies, etc. Like anywhere else you\u2019ll have to try to make friends to make them. There\u2019s lots of school events/club events that make it easy to make friends. My only critique would be that if your conservative it may be a bit harder to make some friends.",

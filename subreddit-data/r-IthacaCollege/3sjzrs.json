That isn't to say that Rochon shouldn't be blamed for the current state of the school, but they're blaming Rochon for the wrong reasons. Inequality is not the most pressing issue on IC's campus.",

I would've dropped him just as quick.\" You didn't even read the attached article to find out that he turned *because* he was shot. You just jumped straight to fantasizing about shooting him yourself.\n\nIntrospection doesn't seem to have worked, so I'll just let you know: you're a racist. Not the \"doesn't support affirmative action\" kind, but the \"resents and hates black people\" kind. IC doesn't want or need people like you.",

            "comment": "Expect their financial aid department to be the least helpful thing in the world. Realize that college is what you make of it and that it's on you to figure out what your plans are, and to find the resources that will help you make those decisions -- what's your intended major? Advice can be more specifically tailored based on what you're going into. Also keep in mind that a lot of people's advice on program-specific things might not be up to date just because they're working on introducing IC 20/20 which involves a lot of changes to requirements and programs. \n\nI also second what the other person said about scholarships and grants -- it's an expensive school, and despite our frequent fundraising (I work for Phonathon) we aren't as well funded as some other schools in the area so our financial aid offerings aren't as amazing as they could be. If you're not given a package that you like remember that you can make appeals to the aid office and try to get them to review things based on your situation.\n\nIf you want to go abroad keep that in mind from the very beginning so that it's easier to plan the rest of your college career around -- it'd suck to not be able to go abroad because you didn't take a class during the right semester.",

I'm going to be entering my senior year next year, if you have any specific questions or need anything drop me a line and I can try to help out or try to get you in touch with another environmental studies student!",

Also, the campus food is very black and white--you can find good food, but be wary, it's few and far between.\nknow that if you want to party, you can party, and if you want to study, you can study. there's people doing all sorts of different stuff on campus... and without frats, it's easy to make the college and the town your own.",

If you ever communicate with them, use email so that you can prove they said things :)\n\nAlso, use your first year to meet people - join clubs, make friends and have fun! I recommend joining the Humans vs Zombies social club; its a fun way to meet lots of people. Like SonadorHermosa, join ICES!\n\nAlso, as Firelance said - if you post in trees, you'll be right at home...",

If you like policy/activism more, then studies is better.\n\nThere are quite a few environmental themed clubs on campus which let you get to know people in the department better while meeting people in other majors with the same sort of interests.\n\nAlso, IC is great for research opportunities.  Jason Hamilton's lab makes maple syrup and honey and grows mushrooms.  Its pretty sweet.\n\nHit me up if you have any more questions or if you're coming to visit and want a tour of the department.",

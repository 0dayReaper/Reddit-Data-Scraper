            "comment": "As a sophomore I highly considered transferring; didn\u2019t go through with it for many reasons. I think being virtual is definitely impacting your experience. However, it\u2019s better to transfer earlier rather than later so you don\u2019t fall behind at the next school. What you could do is stay at IC and finish your freshman year then transfer to another school while taking classes that would count to the next school so you\u2019re not behind. Look at their requirements for the major you want and begin to meet those requirements before transferring. If you do transfer, you have some appropriate credits, and if you don\u2019t, you got some pre-requisites done that could go towards IC\u2019s requirements. Everything is still very flexible your freshman year",

She told me to take a leave of absence if I disliked being online so much. I understand her POV, but she wasn\u2019t very helpful. Administration here just lowkey pisses me off",

It is a weird school, I don't know if it's because I met the wrong group when I was there, but people generally seemed very shallow and cold. Also, being the only Asian and minority there I experienced plenty of racism from most students. If you feel like it's not a place for you, then go. Don't waste your time.",

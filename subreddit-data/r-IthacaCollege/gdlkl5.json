    "postText": "I got into the Film BFA for the fall and I\u2019m just here tryna get opinions on the program and the school. Ithaca\u2019s probably the priciest school (Syracuse was just a straight no because of that) and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth it. My other tops choices are Hofstra, DePaul, Quinnipiac, and Belmont.",

            "comment": "Park is great because of a lot of the hands on work you can do and the staff is amazing. That being said, there are a lot of little problems that add up. \n\nThe housing system is very frustrating and parking on campus is usually brutal. The communications advisors are almost always professors who were forced into doing it and some have absolutely no clue what they\u2019re talking about when it comes to helping you form a four year plan or how to navigate the gen-eds.\n\nA lot of what you learn in the film program can be picked up by educating yourself (my opinion) and the biggest advantage in going to IC is the connections you make, the alumni, the professors, and the fact you can start filming things first semester freshman year. \n\nThe surrounding town is very nice though and it\u2019s a great community! That was my favorite part about attending the school. There are plenty of house parties too, and the local music scene is great as well",

            "comment": "Park is a great school. That being said, it also depends on what kind of community you're looking for. I can't speak about the other schools of course, but Ithaca is a smaller college so it gives you a more tight-knit community feel. The city of Ithaca is beautiful and has a pretty cool indie/underground/hippie scene, in terms of food and arts. It doesn't have all the metro amenities like a major shopping mall or a variety of grocery stores, but if you can drive or don't mind navigating the public transportation system it's pretty manageable. I don't know about the bar scene really but there's no shortage of house parties between IC and Cornell.",

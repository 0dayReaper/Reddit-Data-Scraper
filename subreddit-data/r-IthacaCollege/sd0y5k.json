I was friends with innumerable Parkies while there and many are still some of my closest friends. Exceptional program, tight knit little campus, beautiful little city.",

The film school is great, and if you decide your heart isn\u2019t in it anymore, there are a myriad of choices to fallback on. As for the overall atmosphere of the school, I miss it everyday. It\u2019s a great place if you can stomach the cold.",

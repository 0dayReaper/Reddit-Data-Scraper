    "postText": "Hello r/ithacacollege!  I've posted here before regarding fundraisers for Ithaca High School's Brain Team, an extremely talented and diverse group of students that participate in academic quiz competitions locally and nationally.  We're ranked in the 60s nationally, and are the number 2 team in New York State this year!  \n\nTo help us get to nationals, we're hosting a $10 all-you-can-eat fundraiser at Moe's Southwest Grill along Rte. 13.  Just $10!  That's about as much as a burrito and drink are by themselves!  And it's all-you-can-eat!  **AND** $7 of that goes to the Brain Team!\n\nAll you need to do is show up and show off [this flyer](http://tinyurl.com/BrainTeam).  You could also join our [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1428281110744661) to find the flyer.  The fundraiser is from 7:00 to 10:00.  We hope to see you there!",

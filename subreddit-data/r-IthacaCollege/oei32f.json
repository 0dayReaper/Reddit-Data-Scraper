The cost is quite similar (Ithaca is 23k/year and the other one 20k/year). \n\nI would like to talk and ask about Ithaca College and the city in general, the business department and more. I have to make the decision fast. \ud83d\ude2d",

The faculty are great too -- great business minds, but also still student-centered.  I don't know a ton about some of those kinds of extracurriculars at SoB, but I know the Sports Management cohort gets to do some really epic practicum kind of stuff. The faculty in that department specifically are welllll connected in their field (haha that's punny).",

As far as our actual community, I find that for the most part everyone is extremely nice, plus we do got some fun parties. As for the actual town, there isn\u2019t a crazy amount of things to do, but it\u2019s enough to the point where you\u2019ll be occupied for your 4 years there. Also side note, wherever you plan on going, I highly recommend reaching out and making friends before your first semester. It\u2019ll make the adjustment to college 10x easy. But yeah, do you have any other questions?",

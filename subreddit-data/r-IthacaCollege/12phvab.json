    "postText": "Prospective Ithaca Student Questions\n\nHello all, I am a HS senior who was admitted to Ithaca and am kinda down to the wire in committing to a school, so I wanted to ask some questions. For reference I was admitted into the Park Pathways program at the Park school.\nQuestions:\n- What is the general curriculum outside your major like?\n- Is it easy to take classes outside of Park?\n- Is the food as bad as people say?\n- How are the dorms? are they clean?\n- Is the school more focused on athletics or academia?\n- How is the theater program?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "\u2022 general curriculum outside of your major is entirely your choice. you have to take one class (over the 4 years) in a few specific areas: math/quantitative literacy, natural science, social science, etc. but they have a lot of fun options and you\u2019ll have room and time to take whatever interests you outside of your major as well. a lot of these classes are also available over the summer and winter if you want more time for other stuff or to study abroad/in LA, which is really encouraged\n \n\u2022 it\u2019s totally easy to take classes outside of park, some classes fill up faster than others and your first year will be the hardest in that regard but even then it\u2019s pretty easy\n\n\u2022 the food is fine- there are 2 dining halls and now towers marketplace is back, and there\u2019s always something to be found at at least one. there\u2019s also plenty of good nearby delivery places and you get free delivery through grubhub\n\n\u2022 depends on the dorm. i don\u2019t recommend terraces at all, quads is the best and towers is pretty good too. it\u2019s on you to keep your own space clean but the bathrooms are fine. \n\n\u2022 the school is far more centered around academia than athletics but we still have plenty of athletics events- but it\u2019s not a major part of the culture here\n\n\u2022 the theatre program is one of the best in the country by ranking and is truly incredible",

Take a well rounded number from different schools, especially some Health &amp; Music Classes.\r  \n\r  \nIs it easy to take classes outside of Park? Very easy.\r  \n \r  \nIs the food as bad as people say? Over all, it is pretty good.\r  \n\r  \nHow are the dorms? are they clean? They are clean. Upper or Lower Quads are best bet for first year student.\r  \n \r  \nIs the school more focused on athletics or academia? Both. \r  \n\r  \nHow is the theater program? Excellent. Really Top Notch!",

            "comment": "Everyone else answered some of the questions well, but idk what they're smoking. The food here is ass. A lot of meat is always undercooked, and the options overall aren't great unless you're using bomber bucks. The dorms are pretty trash. Many of them, towers, terraces, and quads, LITERALLY HAVE MICE AND RATS RUNNING AROUND IN THEM. Some of the bathrooms aren't kept very clean, and if someone vomits in your bathroom and makes a mess at 2am, you gotta wait til the morning until everything is clean again. I promise Park is great, but it's not great enough to justify the price and all of the extra BS.",

Just about any winter jacket will work, try to find one that is a little more wind resistant. It gets pretty windy here. North Face is pricey but they make some great jackets. \nHats and gloves, same deal. Just about anything will work. The hat is important though, something like 70% of your body heat escapes through your head.",

North Face is probably the best yet most expensive you can get.\n\nhttp://www.steepandcheap.com/\n\n^ This is a really awesome site that sells one product at a time for at least 50% off. If you check it regularly you may be able to find a killer deal on something.  ",

A pair or two of cold weather boots (idk if you're a male or female, but no fucking uggs please), a good thick large winter jacket that you can wear lots of things under.  The key is to layer.  As for everything else, go to a thrift store ya dummy!  Get tons of sweaters and flannels and thick long-sleeve t-shirts.  Brands don't matter if everything is super cheap and if you buy something used, you know it's made well if it's still in one piece when you buy it.  And don't be another northface wearing douche...",

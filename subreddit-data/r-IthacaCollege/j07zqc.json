    "postText": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m from the city, and my friend and I (both LGBT, my friend is trans and black) are thinking of moving somewhere quieter to go to school next year. The city is too much for us. We were born and raised there, but it\u2019s loud, it\u2019s violent, it\u2019s aggressive- and in all honestly, it\u2019s not good for our mental health. We also have a dog who HATES the noise of the city. \n\nWe\u2019ve had our eyes on New Paltz for a while now because we fell in love with it. The hiking trails are wonderful, the people are AMAZING, to our surprise the queer community actually exists and is thriving out there, there are BLM signs on almost every house, there are a ton of young folks. People say hi to you everywhere you go, have convos with you etc. nothing like the city.\n\nNow, we can\u2019t just have our eyes pierced on one school only, just incase we don\u2019t get in or something else doesn\u2019t work out. We are looking at Ithaca college (not Cornell. Well, maybe Cornell, but we aren\u2019t exactly rich so probably not) but wanted some insight on what the community is like.\n\nI hear it\u2019s a college town and fairly liberal, which is cool.\n\nFor reference : my friend and I aren\u2019t looking for a party town necessarily. Neither one of us drink (they smoke, though) or go to parties or bars or anything. We like more simple events- like hiking trips and local shows. I guess we\u2019re kinda lame, but we are older students (I\u2019m 28) \n\nI\u2019m going for social work, they\u2019re going to school for physical therapy. \n\nOther important questions : \n\nWhat\u2019s the job market like? We aren\u2019t expecting an amazing job, just something to pay the bills while in school. It can even be a local coffee shop. Are places hiring? Would they hire a 28 year old student or are they more looking for cutesy 17 year olds? \n\nWe can\u2019t drive! We don\u2019t know how to. Maybe we\u2019ll learn, but no promises. We\u2019ll be WALKING EVERYWHERE. In NP, everyone said it wasnt possible, but it is for us. We don\u2019t mind taking a 30 minute walk. Walking is healthy! As long as walking is possible. \n\nIs it possible to walk/bike ride everywhere? \n\nAnd last but not least, weather! Say we are walking everywhere, do the winters get really bad? \n\nAny other tips/knowledge you\u2019d like to give us? \n\nPS - we aren\u2019t actively looking for an LGBT/Black community, we are just looking for a place where we won\u2019t be looked at funny or beat up for just existing. We want to be seen as people, because that\u2019s what we are. Please forgive me if I\u2019ve offended anyone, we are just going based on little towns like Poestenkill that has been horrendous for us to walk in. \n\nThank you so much!",

I don't know what the program for social work is like, but I really love the college. IC is super accepting and probably the most liberal area in existence.\n\nWalking places is totally doable, but winters can get down to 0 F.\n\nIthaca is a really great area and I think you'd like it a lot :)",

The location is not far from Ithaca. 15 mins from IC and Cornell.\n\nIC has a great PT program, but it is a 6 year long program. Usually they do not accept a  traditional DPT or transfers. But it's little different every year. You better check that out.",

I feel that Ithaca is generally pretty accepting to the LGBTQ community. It\u2019s the most liberal place I have ever been. It\u2019s a tough walk if you\u2019re living off campus to IC itself considering we\u2019re on top of a big hill. Either way, there is no short of uber/Lyft drivers and the bussing system is very cheap.",

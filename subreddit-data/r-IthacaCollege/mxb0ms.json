Basically they have specific living spaces set aside for first years (quads and towers) and if it\u2019s anything like when I did it (current junior), you just rank your preferences and they give you a room.\n\nUpper quads - kinda in the middle of everything, good location. Not much else to say, this is a solid choice\n\nLower quads - v close to park, otherwise imo these are the worst because you\u2019re super far from the terraces dining hall (the better one) which is up a hill\n\nTowers - closer to terraces dining hall, Whalen, and the library. 10 minute walk to park (at most). this dorm has 4 individual bathrooms on each floor as opposed to traditional communal ones. I liked it here as a first year BUT it can suck if you\u2019re assigned to a room at the top floor\n\nI suggest looking up dorm tours on YouTube to see what they look like.",

I lived on the 3rd floor so I could just take the stairs. The upper floors of Towers have a great view though, especially if you\u2019re on the lake side.",

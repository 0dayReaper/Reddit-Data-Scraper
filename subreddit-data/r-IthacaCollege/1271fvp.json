    "postText": "Hey guys, I am a prospective freshman in the Park School next year and have a few questions regarding social life and dorms. What's the social scene like on campus? I'm not super big into huge parties, so will I have a hard time making friends if I don't go? Are there smaller/more laid back things that happen often? Also, just wanted to ask what the dorms are like and if there are any freshman buildings with pod style bathrooms or if they are all just communal. Thank you!!",

            "comment": "In my experience, social scene is great. They have a lot of events on campus orientation week and if you\u2019re into local bands, there are a lot of shows u can go to. Smaller laid back things happen a lot if u find a good group of friends\nFirst week people would just wander around campus at night and it was normal to just go up to ppl and talk to them. Everyone\u2019s tryna make friends so\nPretty big bar school tho, so if ur into that it\u2019s important to get a fake. and a lot of ppl go to Cornell parties but the 2 frats at Ithaca throw sometimes \nDorms are pretty ok, communal bathrooms w 3 stalls and 2 showers are standard in upper and lower quads\nI\u2019m in upper quad rn and I like the room there is no AC tho! But as long as u have fans you\u2019ll manage\nTowers has private bathrooms around 4-5 per floor",

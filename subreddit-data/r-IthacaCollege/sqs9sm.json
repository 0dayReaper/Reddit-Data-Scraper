            "comment": "Probably? IC is good at listening to what trans people actually want/need. There\u2019s a \u201cResidential Community\u201d in the works for trans and NB students, to provide more community ties and an open, safe space. I\u2019d say IC (as an institution) is a lot better than other schools about supporting the queer community in general. As a campus culture (students/faculty) it\u2019s even more positive and supportive.",

Some of the housing preferences are aimed toward making people comfortable (especially in the LGBTQ community)\n\nAs someone who's non-binary and was placed with someone who wasnt as comfortable with me. I found housing eh, but taking from other students IC has been amazing to their room selections/roomates.\n\nBut here's the big tip my friend,\n\nYou can find people to room with! IC also has a whole first year class list in the housing portal that allows you to view portfolios of each person and see their common interests/majors! \n\nThere's also Residential Communities, which I highly regret not taking my first year, may definitely be worth it, especially with getting to find your place at IC!\n\nHope this helped!",

Luca (lgbtq+ director) will go to bat for anybody and the housing office is more than accommodating. realistically you'll have to do some reaching out, however you won't have to fight for anything most likely. if you ever have to, Luca *literally* wrote the book on LGBTQ+ rights/acceptance and college responsibilities on college campuses.",

    "postText": "Apparently you can email the school and request a single room, but idk if you gotta be disabled or weird or something to get one. Look roommates are cool and all but I'm not about to make this kid sleep in the hallway while I shag all night, plus nobody wants to live with a kid who smells like an ashtray. If I  say this more eloquently in an email with these two reasons as to why I need a single room, do you think the school will buy it? otherwise its just some other kids funeral.",

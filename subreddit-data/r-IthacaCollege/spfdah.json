    "postText": "Hi all!\n\nI graduated from Ithaca in 2011 from the theatre school. My nephew is now considering Ithaca for film (not totally sure what major he got accepted for) and is heading up there tomorrow to check it out. \n\nHe has plan to do a general tour and park school tour, but I thought it might be beneficial for him to chat with a current student in the film program to talk about their experiences/ show a project/ answer questions/ talk about campus life, etc. while he is there this weekend!\n\nPlease let me know if you are a current park student and would be interested or have a friend who would be!",

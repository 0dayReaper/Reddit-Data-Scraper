            "comment": "If you prefer peace and quiet, go for any of the upper quads as they are right near whalen (lower quads are slightly closer to the business school tho). As others have said Holmes is closest to Whalen (music school). I lived in Hood and really liked it, you can get a bit of a nicer view of the quad imo if you have a North facing room. Towers are also really close to Whalen. Some people prefer towers but just be aware that usually more rowdy students like to live there. You can luck out and get an absolutely amazing view of the lake in towers, also it's been refurbished in the past year unlike quads which are getting a bit old. But like I said you might need to get used to constant partying if the people on your floor are into that. Hoped that helps!",

            "comment": "I currently live in West Tower with a music major roommate. He picked it cuz it\u2019s literally a rock\u2019s throw away from Whalen\u2014it is very convenient; as a music student you\u2019re gonna be there and pretty much there all the time, so highly recommend just for that. I also love the feel of the layout as it\u2019s co-Ed by door and has individual bathrooms. It feels more like an apartment than a dorm honestly (and it\u2019s currently Freshman only so snag it while you can if you ask me). \n\nBUT, huge BUT, I highly recommend, if you can, requesting a corner room specifically or at least a dorm on the lake view side (not so much for the view, though I\u2019m sure it\u2019s gotta be real nice to wake up to that, but for the sake of your sleep. We\u2019ve got parking lot side and people are always outside on weekends till the stupid hours of the night getting Uber\u2019s and shit)\n\n^you could also probably request a higher floor to address this problem, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend that because the elevators can be unreliable (not so unreliable that\u2019s it\u2019s \u201cunlivable,\u201d but if one day you\u2019re late to class and the elevator\u2019s are taking forever trust me you\u2019re gonna wish you could easily use the stairs). We\u2019re on floor five and it\u2019s pretty solid. Just high enough where you not a TOTAL asshole for taking the elevator from G, but also low enough that the stairs are no problem.",

    "postText": "Sorry for the clickbait title but Ithaca college seems so amazing. The community of Ithaca is so warm and welcoming and I've had the best experience throughout my admissions process with Ithaca college. I am going to be a s-stem scholar and was wondering why people keep trashing it? As well as CS. I've seen the previous posts, but I am seriously considering Ithaca but I need someone to give be a definitive guide or explanations as to why to avoid CS at Ithaca. The professors seem very kinda and welcoming too, the environment seems very bright!",

While there are other more prestigious schools for CS, I truly believe that I am getting the superior education because of the healthy culture around work in the department. It's very much possible to let yourself slide and get away with the bare minimum, but there are amazing student research opportunities if you take the time to connect with your professors and demonstrate your drive. I'd rather be an undergrad with publications and research experience that doesn't want to commit suicide than have a paper from an ivy any day.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that none of the cuts are in the CS department. The cuts are removing 17 programs that graduate an average 38 people a year. I don't see how it's reasonable to expect any college to be able to run programs and departments that average 8 total students at any given time. While the communication from the administration has been disappointing, don't blindly assume the college is dying because of how people moan about the cuts on here.\n\nFeel free to send me a DM with your discord name and we can chat if you'd like.",

    "postText": "Im a incoming freshman taking art as a minor(parents wouldn't let me major). Before I got the chance to sign up for classes I saw that there were zero spots open for any 100 painting courses and 1 SPOT for any 100 drawing course. I tried to sign up immediately as it opened for me and I didn't get it. How is this even fair??? They tell me to take classes towards my intended minor but don't even give me the option wtf seriously.",

As I was told we\u2019re at the bottom of the food chain so we get the least options. Keep an eye on it over the next few weeks but also during the add/drop period, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get a spot.",

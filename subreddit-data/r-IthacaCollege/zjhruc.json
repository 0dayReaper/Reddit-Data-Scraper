    "postText": "Hey everyone! I'm wondering if anyone at IC wants to start a band. I play guitar and sing, and have a space we can practice. However, unfortunately I do not have a drum set. I'm happy to help transport that though. I'd ideally want to be playing alt music, anything from metal to shoegaze to indie! Lmk if you're interested!",

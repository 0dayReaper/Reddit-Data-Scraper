            "comment": "Not sure why the other comments are getting downvoted, there are some respectable Pros! But as a prospective applicant, you cannot ignore the cons.\n\nI transferred from IC. Here\u2019s why:\n- My major department was slashed from 15 profs to ~5, with my advisor (chair) leaving to pursue more \u201cpromising opportunities\u201d. We went from ~18 incoming freshmen in my major to &lt;10\n- There is no pre-law, or at least nothing maintained. The mock trial team is a joke not just bc of their lackluster results, but I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re pretentious assholes\n- The honors program ceased to exist\n- Freshmen dorms are poorly maintained and my building had mold by the showers, ceiling tiles falling down, flooding in the basement, etc.\n- IC is a residential college but there\u2019s only 2 dining halls and now only &lt;5 retail dining places for the entirety of campus. Note that most of them close earlier in the day, and IC does not pay for any off campus Grubhub or Uber Eats orders \n- You have to pay for your own TCAT pass ($30/15 days), whereas at cornell it\u2019s free for freshmen\n- Administration tends to invest more in sports than academia, so if you\u2019re looking for research support, go elsewhere \n- Campus culture is\u2026 unique. There\u2019s a lot of chill vibes but also a lot of complacency and people love to just complain for the sake of complaining \n- Ithaca has unique architecture and only 1 library. Personally the whole post-Soviet brutalist architecture was not the vibe for me in the dead of winter lol \n- People are generally VERY wealthy at IC, it surprised me that so many people just casually spend $200-500 every week\n\n\nOn the bright side, the gym is really nice and people are welcoming!",

Some of the others, well maybe not so much. Don't let the naysayers get you down, IC has restructured for the long run. It isn't going anywhere.",

            "comment": "I just transferred from another university to ithaca college and I love it so far! People are quick to complain about the food and campus, but it\u2019s a small inconvenience compared to the issues I was having at my other school. Yes, the campus is hilly, but it\u2019s also not a huge campus which is one of my favorite things. Everything on campus is very walkable. If your not in shape it might be more annoying. The food isn\u2019t too bad either, I just think the meal plan is way too overpriced. They have tons of options everyday so if you don\u2019t like the main dish it\u2019s not the end of the world. They also have good kosher, allergy-free, and vegan options. I would say that if your planning on being in the business school, parks school, human sciences, or music program than you should definitely highly consider ithaca because those are our top programs! Any other major, you\u2019re likely to hear more mixed reviews and complaints. The main reason why I like this school so much though is the environment. Everyone is super friendly and accepting here. Not only is it beautiful here, but the vibes and atmosphere is very homey. It\u2019s not hard to make friends with so many activities going on. Definitely plan a visit if you\u2019re debating!!",

When I went, people wouldn't even talk to you unless you were a jock or played some type of sports. I remember there were already lots of cliques even at my freshman orientation. Not a good place to go if you're Asian too. Experienced loads of racism there.",

President, vice president,  cfo, admissions , financial aid, development,  deans, etc. The list goes beyond those as the number of staff leaving has been alarming. They even got rid of academic advising, as in entire department. Look elsewhere.",

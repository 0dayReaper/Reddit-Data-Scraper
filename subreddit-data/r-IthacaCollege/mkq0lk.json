Ithaca college is my cheapest option, so naturally I want to attend but I have been having a hard time finding out more about the school of business. \n\nThe IC website has loads of information about Park and other schools but the business section looks so empty. \n\nCan the people here please help me and give me an honest opinion about the school of business?",

            "comment": "$45k/year??  If so, it's a no brainer. Even not, if IC is your cheapest/best option, it's a great school to be your cheapest/best option.  Many of the SoB profs were of my favorite on campus, and it's a well-accredited school. I'd say, in spite of the current climate on campus and perhaps an unsteady future, go for it!",

I would normally encourage everyone do to whatever they can to reduce student debt as much as possible, but RIT for just 3,500/year is a wicked deal. It's got to be RIT.  You're basically comparing a Ferrari on, like, a mega Black Friday sale versus a hand-me-down free Honda Civic -- the choice is clear.",

    "postText": "I just recently took a trip to visit IC and Syracuse U. I really liked IC (probably more than SU), and I have a few questions about it.\n\nSome info: If I were to go to IC, I would likely major in Emerging Media, if not that, definitely something in the Park School.\n\nI am going to accept the winter.\n\nQuestions:\nI noticed the town of Ithaca is not walking distance from the campus. How easy/hard/necessary is it to get into town? I've heard the TCAT is not very reliable. How often do you find yourself going into town? I know cars are allowed all 4 years. How necessary do you think having a car is each year?\n\nI'm a big fan of live music and music in general. What is the music scene like in Ithaca? Is there a good amount of restaurants/bars that host live music? Also, are there any larger venues that host acts that you might actually have heard of? Are there any more popular acts that have come to Ithaca?\n\nObviously these things aren't the most important about the school. These are just some things I were unsure of.\n\nFeel free to let me know anything you think I should in making my decision.",

Anything more specific and I'd typically take a taxi. Taxi service is really good here. Overall, plenty of people take the bus, and plenty of people also make friends with upperclassmen who have cars!",

            "comment": "Hey there! Happy you're considering Ithaca. It's a fantastic place. I can speak to a few things - Park School: Do it. The park school really is amazing. I cannot speak more highly of it. In terms of getting down town, as a Freshman, you really don't need to go down town very much. With that said, I had a car all 4 years, and I really appreciated it. It is expensive to park Freshman year, but when you consider having your parents come and pick you up, potentially have a hotel over night and go home the next day, it does make sense. You could have a car all four years, or never have a car at all, and you would be fine either way. TCAT is nice, especially for going downtown. Going somewhere like the Mall on TCAT really sucks. \n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any more specific questions, but seriously, Ithaca is the right choice. ",

There are a TON of indie bands and a few more well known acts that come through the area playing at venues such as the Haunt and the State Street Theater on a regular basis. There's a pretty neat local music scene if you're into that as well. \n\nSome of the acts that have come around have been the Avett Brothers, and Michael Franti/Spearhead will come later this year. There are plenty of others, those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head. ",

            "comment": "Senior Computer Science student here (kind of an emerging media student). I am really happy to see this major becoming more popular. It is an awesome program and I highly recommend you come be a part of it. I would have done it if were offered when I applied to IC. \n\nFirst of all, campus is absolutely within walking distance to downtown. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the commons. I do it pretty much every day. Sure it's uphill getting back to campus, but the exercise is good for ya! If you don't want to walk, the TCAT is a great resource. It loops between campus and the commons every half an hour and can take you all over Tompkins County if you so desire. In all my 3 years in Ithaca, I have never had a problem with the TCAT. \n\nIn terms of the need to get off campus, there isn't technically ever a *need* to. You can spend an entire semester without leaving if you really want. But Ithaca has a lot of awesome things to offer. There are great restaurants, beautiful parks and trails to explore, and a kick-ass music scene. \n\nIthaca has a great mix of very talented local bands (John Brown's Body, Jimkata, and Kinship to name a few). But there are also some very popular artists that make their way through as well. In the past we have had, The National, The Mountain Goats, Bob Dylan, Passion Pit, Man Man, Nas, Lupe Fiasco, Janelle Monae w/ Fun., Josh Ritter,  and plenty of others. To give you a list of other upcoming shows in the area, check out http://dansmallspresents.com/. \n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to PM me. Especially about the Emerging Media program. \n\n",

            "comment": "Emerging Media student here. I'm a rising junior and I just spent my last two semesters being an EM major. Before that I was Exploratory.\n\nFirst off, it's an awesome major with a wide range of possibilities. Everyone in the major is skilled in slightly different areas due to its combination of Computer Science, Television-Radio, and Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC). This is great for collaboration, too.  Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about Emerging Media. \n\nEveryone likes to talk shit about TCAT, but it's really not that bad. Yeah, it can be late sometimes. But just try to anticipate that and you shouldn't have a problem. It's also only a 15-20 min walk to the commons. \n\nCars can be great, although not really needed your freshman year. They're only really needed if you live in Circle apartments or an off-campus apartment. If you have 500 dollars to drop for the freshman parking pass (maybe more now?) and think you'll be moving around a lot (beyond the commons) , then it might be worth it. Other then that I would wait it out. It's significantly cheaper even by your sophomore year. \nIthaca definitely has a live music scene as everyone said. There is also a popular open mic session in the TC Lounge every wednesday night. There are some pretty good bands that come to IC... and Cornel helps bring them in too. I've seen Passion Pit twice now, once at Cornel and once in Rochester (about an hour away). \n\nWhat are you current interests? I could recommend a concentration in EM. ",

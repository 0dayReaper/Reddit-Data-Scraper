            "comment": "I was a biology/biochem student around 5-9 years ago. PM me for more details, but to be brief, you can get a STEM education virtually anywhere. \n\nSeriously. The important thing to look for is a program where you'll be able to work with faculty doing research (IC's bio/biochem program requires it, so you're guaranteed a research position). Additionally, look for opportunities to get on papers, even if it's not first author, although you should strive for this. Get into a lab your Freshman year, don't wait to start talking to professors whose labs interest you. If traditional research is not your thing, look for programs that have opportunities beyond the classroom. A STEM degree from a liberal arts college isn't going to be the deciding factor in a job placement/grad school or professional school admission after your degree; experience in the form of research, internships, outreach, co-ops, etc. will be. \n\nGranted, this same thing can be said for most STEM programs (especially STM, as engineering programs usually have something like co-ops built in), but at Ithaca, I found the faculty to be truly interested in undergraduate development in the sciences, and especially in critical thinking regarding research (as opposed to focusing on mentoring graduate students, as my peers from state schools found).

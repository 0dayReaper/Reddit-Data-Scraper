    "postText": "I'm a rising senior in high school right now and am a tuba player. I'm going to school to become a band teacher, and I'm wondering what music ed majors already at IC think of the school? Any positives? Negatives? Anything I should be wary of? Advice for auditions?\n\nAlso: I have a solo for my audition that I have prepared but it's not on the list of recommended solos. I talked to Dr. Earll about it in a lesson I had with him and he said it would be fine, but does anyone know how I'd go about okaying it with the school before my audition? I've got quite some time before I need to audition though so no hurry. \n\nThanks",

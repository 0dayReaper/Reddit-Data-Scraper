But that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.\n\nPark is a money maker. I can\u2019t comment on the culture as I am not a student but the communications programs seems to get high praise from students and alumni. \n\nSome of the way more obscure small programs got cut, but that\u2019s the reality of most universities these days. \n\nResources are being shifted to programs people want to pay for. IC is developing a brand new PA program which includes building out a new facility, hiring new professors and staff, procuring large quantities of equipment, etc.",

Park is great (I wasn't a Parkie, fwiw), and you will have as much opportunity to try other things as you would choose to.\n\nThat being said Ithaca is expensive, as are most schools like it, getting some classes out of the way at a community/state school and then transferring in can save you a TON, but you might lose out on some of the early college experience that is so meaningful",

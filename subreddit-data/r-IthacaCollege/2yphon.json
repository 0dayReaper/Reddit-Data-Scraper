For instance I want to work for a management or marketing team for a movie studio such as Dreamworks or Universal. That is my dream job but I want to be around marketing. Do you think the marketing in Ithaca is as good as a Maryland or a Syracuse?",

It gets you close to the park school which has a lot more in terms of alumni and internship connections. I do think the IMC program at Ithaca is as good as Maryland or Syracuse, but IMO, the business admin program is not. The IMC program will have you taking about half comms classes, and half business classes. In my opinion, its a better route. ",

That way you can get into the ICLA Program and they have lots of awesome internships. My personal addition is do the ICLA Program in the summer. It's like a vacation except you're gaining experience at the same time. It's incredible, and I've done it twice now. ",

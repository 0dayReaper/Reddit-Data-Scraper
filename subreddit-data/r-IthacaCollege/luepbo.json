The CS department faculty is excellent and they really strive to encourage a learning environment instead of a crushing weight of stress and unreasonable expectations.

It used to be a quirky, crunchy cool place with really great programs that focused on students and learning.  Now?  They're cutting over 100 professors and have focused on adding more buildings and amenities and less on high-quality education.  I'd reconsider IC, as much as it pains me to say that.",

It is a business and I applaud the work they are doing to stay viable.  It makes me sad that programs are being cut and professors let go but IC is not alone in this.  They just cut my sons major and I still highly recommend IC for all that it still offers and will offer in its \u201cIthaca Forever\u201d quest.  Visit and have conversations with students and administrators.",

            "comment": "A few things that would have probably turned me off of going to Ithaca had I known them beforehand:\n\n* You are required to live on campus for the first two years, more often than not stuck in cramped, overpriced dorms. Dining hall food is atrocious and the hours/facilities are not enough to support the student body's food needs. Sometimes Juniors are allowed off campus but more often than not they are stuck on. Next year no juniors will be permitted to live off campus.\n* The administration is top-heavy and mismanaged. Instead of trying to reformat that, they're letting go loads of amazing professors who have taught at the school for years, including many that I have had and formed close connections with.\n\nHonestly if you are going for Computer Science, I'd say that there are good degree programs at loads of schools for that, and I don't foresee IC getting better before it gets worse. Ithaca Forever is a sham and the folks in the Office of Admissions are just trying to pull on new students without taking care of the ones currently enrolled. I've had to fight tooth and nail to eck out a good experience at this school, and I wouldn't advise anyone else to do the same.",

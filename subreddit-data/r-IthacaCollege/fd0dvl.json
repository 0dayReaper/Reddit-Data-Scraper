    "postText": "I like to do some video editing and PC gaming from time to time, but my computer gets ridiculously overheated. The fans just aren\u2019t that great. I live in West Tower where there isn\u2019t any AC or anything so my room gets pretty hot which doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ve tried working in the library but it\u2019s always pretty warm there, or at least not cold at all. \n\nWhat I\u2019m asking is, what buildings/rooms/areas on campus have air conditioning and would allow me to sit and use my computer? Someone told me to check out the Park editing suite but (a) I\u2019m not a Parkie and (b) I was under the impression that the editing suite was like a computer lab, not for personal computers.\n\nBasically, does anyone know a really cold area on campus? It can be anywhere as long as it has AC.",

A lot of people online with the same laptop have been having fan issues so that\u2019s on me for not doing enough research for buying.",

The better thing to do is to actually open up the laptop and blow it off. If you do that and it's still having thermal issues then I would look into some other stuff. Oh important note, when using the compressed air can keep it up right as possible because inverting it will cause it to spray liquid.",

I\u2019ll also look into fan curves, thank you.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that my fans will be running at 100% and it\u2019ll still be really hot. Would fan curves help this? I\u2019m not really sure what they do, honestly.",

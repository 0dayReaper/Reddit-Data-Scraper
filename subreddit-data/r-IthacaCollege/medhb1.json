The education I received (and being on a first name basis with the professors) helped shape my worldview and expectations. Having hands on training your first year is a big difference from competing programs where you don\u2019t touch equipment or do \u201cpractical\u201d work until junior year.",

            "comment": "Fellow Park grad here (TVR 2020). One of the first things that you\u2019ll realize coming to IC is that the Park School is without a doubt the college\u2019s first priority when it comes to money and resources\u2013 so most of the shitshow that\u2019s been going on doesn\u2019t impact Park. \n\nSomething I didn\u2019t realize is that because IC has such a Liberal Arts-focused curriculum, you might not have room in your schedule for all the Park classes you want. With that in mind, your experience here is what you make of it, so it\u2019s a really good idea to get super involved in things like ICTV, Park Productions, the Ithacan etc. \n\nThere are tons of opportunities to get experience at Park and loads of resources to help you figure out what you want to do and help you with job-related stuff. Being a small school means your professors actually care about you, and that you\u2019ll form a very close-knit \u201cfamily\u201d within your major.\n\nI\u2019d say go for it, but look very closely at your major\u2019s courses and consider whether they fit your goals or not. Don\u2019t pass up any opportunities. Park is a great place to be and I wish I could\u2019ve done more during my time there!",

I don\u2019t know what makes a quality CompSci program but I don\u2019t think IC is exactly known for being a great school for math and computer things. Plus, most of the faculty cuts are in the Humanities and Sciences. \n\nCS like Communication Studies? Last time I checked that major is [donezo](https://ithacaedu.sharepoint.com/sites/OfficeoftheProvostPublicDocuments/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FOfficeoftheProvostPublicDocuments%2FShared%20Documents%2Foffice%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fprovost%5Fdocs%2FAPP%20Updates%2FShape%20of%20the%20College%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FOfficeoftheProvostPublicDocuments%2FShared%20Documents%2Foffice%5Fof%5Fthe%5Fprovost%5Fdocs%2FAPP%20Updates&amp;p=true&amp;originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9pdGhhY2FlZHUuc2hhcmVwb2ludC5jb20vOmI6L3MvT2ZmaWNlb2Z0aGVQcm92b3N0UHVibGljRG9jdW1lbnRzL0VUMlZGV191ZDBwRmxiU2Q0OXRQVXY0QmVVTlBnUjBFVVNaSzFWcjlMRGZPWEE_cnRpbWU9SVZxRFdTSHoyRWc). \n\nIC has been facing \u201cmoney issues\u201d due to decreased enrollment for a while now. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, should you choose to come to Ithaca, there\u2019d be even more cuts in funding, resources, etc. during your time here. Makes me really, really sad to think about because the Ithaca College I knew was such an amazing place to be. With the exception of the dorms, the library, and the leaky roofs in Friends Hall lmao. Just remember no college is perfect and that you have to decide what your priorities are. \n\nEdit: Sorry the think requires an Ithaca ID to view. If you really wanna see some proof I\u2019ll figure out how to post some screenshots.",

    "postText": "Hey.\n\nI recently was accepted as a transfer to the Park school of Comm. I\u2019ve seen the school and it seems nice, though small. I\u2019m really interested in TV and communications. However, I also got into UMich, but it\u2019s not exactly the major program I\u2019m looking for, though it\u2019s about a quarter of the price. Ithaca will leave me with about 20k debt after my final two years in school.\n\nI was wondering what you guys thought of the school? I researched the program a lot, but I was curious on student\u2019s takes too.\n\nThanks!",

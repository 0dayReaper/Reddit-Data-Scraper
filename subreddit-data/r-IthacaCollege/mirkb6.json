    "postText": "I got into the art history program in the humanities school, and I have been considering going, but now I'm seeing all of the stuff about budget cuts, and I'm wondering if it's even worth it any more. I've also been considering a school in Wisconsin and with everything I've been seeing it seems like the Wisconsin school may be a better option. Any advice?",

One of the art buildings which is essentially a temporary garage turned temporary classroom turned permanent art building has gotten no attention from the administration, you would have a mediocre experience at best",

They're trimming the wrong parts of the college: students and professors not administration and fancy new buildings.  I got a great education when I attended.   I don't have confidence that you'd have the same experience now, especially given the current price.  Save your money and head elsewhere.  This hurts me to say, because I really did have a wonderful time.  Hopefully the college will find its way.",

    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI've applied to Ithaca College for Music Education and my audition is in December, but my main instrument is the tuba and I don't have much experience with singing. I can match a pitch and sing intervals and stuff like that but sight singing is a completely new monster to me and it's my understanding that I'll need to sight sing at my audition. Seeing as Ithaca is known so well for its music program, I'd imagine there are at least some music students on the subreddit. What was your sight singing like in the audition? How difficult was it (particularly asking non-vocal majors but everyone's input is appreciated)? Does anyone have tips for how to sight sing better (I can do simple stuff with a starting pitch, but it goes downhill quickly with more components being thrown in)?\n\nThank you so much!",

            "comment": "Hi,\nThe sightsinging portion of your audition has very little to no effect on your admission decision. The sightsinging is nearly only for class placement if I remember correctly. Don\u2019t sweat it. I helped work auditions last year and I saw plenty of people bomb it (despite being fantastic musicians) and appear on campus in the fall.\n\nMost sightsinging is just a product of good ear training, so if you use any of the countless ear training tools out there, you can start that way. \n\nPro tip: send an email to one (probably not all) of the faculty members like Prof Medina-Gray, Silberman (the chair of the department),Cummings or John White (or your potential instrument studio teacher) introducing yourself, asking for materials in preparation for this portion, and asking the same question that I already tried to answer. It really helps to start making connections early!\n\nHope this helps!",

                    "comment": "Oh thank *GOD*. Thank you for the very helpful response!! I've already reached out to my the tuba professor Dr. Earll there and I've met him a couple of times (private lesson last summer, Tuba/Euph day this fall, etc.) I am also literally the first person he will be seeing for auditions as I am the first time slot on the first available day so I'm feeling pretty good about the connections I've made thus far at IC!\n\nI've been practicing my sight singing so I don't *think* I'll bomb it, but I'm definitely not going to \"pass\" it with flying colors (even though my understanding is that it doesn't work like a pass/fail, but you know what I mean). \n\nAnother question since you've been involved in audition stuff there: how long roughly would you say it takes for people to get word on whether they made it or not? And would that be the same time they get their financial aid package?\n\nThank you!",

For late January / February audition days, they usually get decisions out at the beginning March, along with the rest of the acceptance package. Decision date is April 15.\n\nGood luck on auditions!",

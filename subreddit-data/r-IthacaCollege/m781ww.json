Do you guys think its worth it?",

I got admitted as undecided (exploratory) on Humanities and Social Sciences, so I guess I can take any classes I want.\n\nMy biggest concern is the issues with the administration that everyone is talking about and maintaining the GPA.\n\nCould you expand a bit on how you can take Cornell courses?",

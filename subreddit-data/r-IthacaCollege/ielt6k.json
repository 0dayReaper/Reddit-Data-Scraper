I\u2019m not an acting major as well, however I hope my perspective can be of value.\n\nSchool plays had left a bad taste in my mouth from middle/high school because, y\u2019know, they were by a bunch of people who couldn\u2019t care less about acting. Come November at Ithaca, my friends dragged me out to one of the musicals. Mind you, I went kicking and screaming because I considered myself the last person to enjoy theatre.\n\nThe show was absolutely breathtaking. The sets, the professionalism, the acting, all of it. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it, and I returned the next week to see it again with other friends. Between every performance they did, the entire school came out to support as if it were a football game. I plan on seeing the next show (when it happens).\n\nIf you do join IC\u2019s acting major, I\u2019d advise you to keep your connections open with as many students as possible. I\u2019m majoring in film, and lots of comm students reach out to acting majors for roles in their movies/TV shows.\n\nMy point is our actors at IC are heavily celebrated, as I just saw one of my acting major friends in a Disney short the other day. I can\u2019t promise you\u2019ll get opportunities immediately, you gotta gain connections first.\n\nHope you could take some meaning from it. Best of luck.",

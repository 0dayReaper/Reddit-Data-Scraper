            "comment": "For some people it can be good to form a solid cohort by living with the same people you\u2019re in class with, especially during freshman year\u2013 those are the friendships that last. I have friends who are still extremely close with the people in their \u201cfreshman cohort\u201d because they had so much to bond over in and out of class during those crucial first semesters. You\u2019ll still have plenty of opportunities to meet other people in classes and in future housing assignments. \n\nAs for quads, I lived in Bogart and it was not that bad. The rooms are big enough, it\u2019s closer to (most) classes, the fitness center, Z-Lot, and Campus Center, which has retail dining and a dining hall. There\u2019s also lots of trees and grass to chill and study by. I\u2019d say go for it!",

The honors dorm is not as good as other housing choices as a freshman and is really old. I didn\u2019t live there but I\u2019ve seen it and you\u2019ll definitely want towers as a freshman. I\u2019m in the honors program too so if you have anymore questions let me know",

Only one class semester was with honors students, and everything else was with students from my major. \n\nOf course, things could have changed since then, but I had a great experience! Never wanted to live in towers! Loud and hot and the elevators break. :)",

            "comment": "When I was in Ithaca Lyon Hall was honors. The people were ok but some of them were hardos and would knock on my wall at like 10:00 pm if I was being \u201cnoisy\u201d. A lot of them were very very close and it almost became like a cult.... they outlawed condoms in the bathroom (really?) and the RA was the one of the craziest ladies I\u2019ve ever met. RAs are a dice roll though. Overall if you want a more traditional dorm situation, don\u2019t live in an honors housing. \n\nThe honors program itself is kinda a joke. The only reason ppl stayed was because you get first pick for classes (really, really nice). After freshman year though it became more tedious with the honors classes doing random ass shit that wasn\u2019t helpful.",

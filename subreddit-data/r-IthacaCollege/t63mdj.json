    "postText": "I have received my financial aid package today as an international student. I really appreciate my merit-based scholarships. However, I got an $8000 Ithaca college grant. When I ran the net price calculator, my estimated award was $23,500. So there is a massive gap between these numbers. Is there any chance that Ithaca estimated my family\u2019s income wrong? Or can I send them an appeal letter via their financial aid office email? Thanks in advance for your help.",

    "postText": "[Electric Buffalo Records](https://www.facebook.com/electricbuffalorecords/) is a student-run label, operating under the purview of the Cornell Media Guild. We hold our meetings at WVBR-FM, near where the old Chapter House stood. The main goal of EBR is to give Cornell &amp; IC students (and Ithaca residents) a chance to get their music out to a wider audience, through iTunes, Spotify, and traditional networks like radio and print articles.\n\nSince Electric Buffalo Records started last spring, many people have gotten involved - photographers, musicians, producers, you name it. One of the most active participants has been [Kurt Riley](https://www.facebook.com/kurtrileymusic/), a Cornell senior whose \"[scintillating brand of glam/new wave/punk rock that will excite you about the direction of contemporary music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyVF25VEx0)\" \n\nEBR is very excited about his new album, \"Kismet.\" All of the musicians are Cornell and Ithaca College students, and it was recorded right on Cornell's campus. The first music video from the album, for the song \"[Hush Hush Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZHwtbLL8ME),\" was shot in the Commons. Through the entire process of making the record, Kurt Riley has been able to work with some of Cornell and IC's most talented students.\n\n[Please check out \"Kismet\" on CDBaby when it comes out February 28th.](http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/KurtRiley1) Support local music and your local record label; Electric Buffalo Records is dedicated to bringing you Ithaca's most talented students for years to come - and this is where it all starts!\n",

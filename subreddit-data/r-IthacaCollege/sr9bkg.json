I\u2019m an artist, but it wasn\u2019t a huge game changer for me, because I\u2019m not seeking an art degree and can just do it in my free time. \n\nNot sure what kind of writing you\u2019re interested in, but I\u2019m a screenwriting major (writing for film, tv, and emerging media) and it\u2019s a REALLY great program.",

I'll be staying on campus and I wanted to hear from past/current students their opinion on the best place to stay, or if there's anything in particular I need to know before I choose. \nThe towers and quads are closest to the music centre, I've gathered, but I don't know much else about the dorms.",

Stay away from those but Towers are where it\u2019s at freshman year, especially if you\u2019re a music student! It\u2019s RIGHT next to Whalen and there\u2019s a Towers dining hall so you don\u2019t even need to leave your dorm to get breakfast in the morning. Hope this helps \u2764\ufe0f",

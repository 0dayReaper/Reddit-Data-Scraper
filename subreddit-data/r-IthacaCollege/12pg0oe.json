    "postText": "Hello lovely people at IC!\n\nZero Waste Ithaca's IC Intern created  a petition against plastic turf, which has already gained over 100 signatures since its launch on Saturday. We need your help to reach our  goal of 1,000 signers, so please pass it on. Would love a lot of [ithaca.edu](https://ithaca.edu) addresses on the petition to make a strong case.\n\nPlastic  turf is toxic and can contaminate groundwater with PFAS.  Studies  have also shown that it physically injures athletes.\n\nRecently, news broke about six Philly players  who died of brain cancer, which may be linked to the exposure to the  chemicals in the turf. Multiple municipalities across the US, including  the city of Boston, are banning artificial turfs.\n\nAdditionally,  recycling plastic turf is difficult due to the fact that it contains  multiple types of plastics, making it hard to recycle. A recent expose  on PhillyBurb has brought attention to this issue, highlighting the need  to take action against plastic turf.\n\nThanks y'all!\n\n[https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/halt-the-installation-of-a-new-artificial-turf-field-at-ithaca-college/](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/halt-the-installation-of-a-new-artificial-turf-field-at-ithaca-college/)",

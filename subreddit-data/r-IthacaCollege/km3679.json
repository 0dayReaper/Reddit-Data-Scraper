    "postText": "You may have heard a bunch of doom and gloom about our campus. Let's get a couple things straight. The main concept is we do not have infinite resources. Secondarily, the adjunct union has had a long history of problems with being truthful. \n\nIthaca College didn't really have a general education program across campus until not that long ago. Requirements were set by schools. When the ICC came in it meant majors had to offer more General Education courses. Ithaca College hired 55 new faculty in the same time period as our student body dropped by 700 students. 98% of our revenue comes from tuition, that is not a sustainable move. It was made before the current administration, so they are cleaning up somebody else's mess.\n\nWe have academic programs with a single digit number of majors.  Some departments have 300 and 400 level classes that average around 3 or 4 people in them. Ever wonder why you can't get into a general education course? Because the department is spending most of its resources teaching upper division courses to tiny classes. More importantly, why do students in our weakest programs get the luxury of tiny classes, yet students in our strongest programs get packed in? How small are we going to let these majors get? If the trend lines continue in a very short time period we will have departments with one student in their major and six full time faculty. I am not kidding.\n\n(when I say weakest programs, the humanities programs have some of the lowest course evaluations on campus, and their research is also much weaker)\n\nWould you rather teach a 300 level class to five students in your major **or** a 100 level general education class to non-majors with 25 students? Of course you will take the upper division course. Professors pick classes before adjuncts. Thus departments commonly stick adjuncts in the 100 level classes. \n\nThe academic job market in the humanities and Music has been a complete shit-show for 30+ years.  I had a colleague say her faculty search in Sociology got 400 applications 25 years ago, almost all with Phd's in hand.  Much of what you are hearing is basic job anxiety that has nothing to do with Ithaca College.  People got a PhD in something without thinking about job prospects and are mad they can't get a faculty job, but think they are too good to teach high school. New York State has a high school teacher shortage right now. \n\nTLDR\n\n\\#1. Note that 80-90% of the faculty involved in these protests are in the humanities. The people who  were very fixated on telling everyone their adjuncts cant feed themselves now wonder why people aren't picking their major. Notice that adjuncts in Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, the Park School, etc are not that involved in the adjunct union. It is because these adjuncts have outside jobs. \n\n\\#2 The adjunct union are liars. They lie about adjuncts being the \"lowest paid\", which is complete bullshit. The janitors and staff are paid very little. (Adjuncts get around $50 an hour, staff often gets around $15.) The adjunct union also lied about how much teaching adjuncts do on our campus. They describe their professors as \"vulnerable\", imaging describing people who have graduate degrees and insist they can only work as a professor in the same tone as people with disabilities. WTF.",

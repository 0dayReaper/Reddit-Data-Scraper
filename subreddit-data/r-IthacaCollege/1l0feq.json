    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm a new student soon to be moving into Ithaca, and I've gone through the whole process of acceptance and orientation and the like. During that process I went to an awful lot of information fairs, and saw a lot of extracurricular groups set up some tables. It was great, but many of my personal hobbies (certain video game titles, tabletop roleplaying games, trading card games) usually have smaller groups that do not broadcast themselves as well in such venues. How would you, as students, recommend that I find such groups? Is myIthaca a fairly reliable method? Are there any bulletins that would have information on such things? To give an idea of what I like, I enjoy Pokemon, Magic the Gathering (a card game), and Dungeons and Dragons. Any advice you can give is greatly appreciated!",

Down near the Walmart/Wegmans area is the newly opened gaming shop \"The Enchanted Badger,\" which caters well to tabletop gaming, as well as other types. A lot of students from IC as well as Cornell frequent there. Befriend people in those groups and you'll certainly find people with similar interests.\n\nAs for Pokemon (and the rest as well), it's a well received interest throughout IC. Video gaming of all kinds can be found; it's not uncommon for people to have an N64, Wii, PS2/3, or 360.\n\nGood luck and welcome to IC! You'll fit right in.",

Generally they can direct you to groups that play the D&amp;D and other games you are looking for.\n\nI believe Teo reserved the Taughannock falls room all this semester, and they meet on Fridays.\nEDH was what we played when I was there. They do draft is from time to time.",

It\u2019s really not that much farther and I feel there are more pro\u2019s and the pro\u2019s are better. \n\n1. They\u2019re newer. That comes with good water fountains/bottle fillers on almost every floor. And they have 4 gender neutral bathrooms that are both newer/cleaner and I don\u2019t know anyone who prefers a community bathroom over an individual one.\n\n2. They\u2019re coed by door. This means dorms are segregated by gender/sex. In my opinion that\u2019s just way better. It means bathrooms will be nicer cuz guys wont be gross and it just feels more social and like a community and less like a clique.\n\n3. Better for food. They\u2019re closer to Terraces which is the dining hall that\u2019s open later. There\u2019s also just close to terraces in general. Also they\u2019re attached to Marketplace which is a food place (pizza, burgers, shakes, snacks, etc.). You don\u2019t even have to go outside for this shit which is ***golden*** during the winter.\n\n4. There\u2019s 13 floors so a lot of people to make friends with.\n\n5. There\u2019s the potential of getting a lake view. \n\n#Cons \n\n1. There\u2019s 13 floors. So if you\u2019re on a higher floor, not the greatest. Yes there are elevators, but they\u2019re not totally reliable (sometimes only one works, sometimes they just take a long ass time). If you get Towers you\u2019re gonna want a lower number... but not so low that everyone looks at you like you\u2019re a dick for taking the elevator if you\u2019re feeling lazy.\n\n2. There\u2019s the potential of ***not*** getting a lake view. Not so much the lack of view as it is the noise from the parking lot that could be directly below you\u2014this is the only time a higher up floor is preferable. \n\n3. It\u2019s the opposite end of the campus from Park (but it\u2019s like a 7 minute walk tops so I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth being the deciding factor. I\u2019m a C&amp;P major and I definitely don\u2019t regret choosing Tower).\n\n4. Farthest from the parking lot if you\u2019re bringing a car. \n\n5. Farther from the gym than quads",

The Towers are noisier but you get used to it, and there are a few stairs to take to get, well, anywhere. \n\n\n\nHowever here are the upsides:\n\n- One in four chance you get the prettiest view on campus.\n- P R I V A T E    B A T H R O O M S\n- Recently Renovated\n- Lots of laundry machines and if you can time yourself correctly you always get one. \n- The Quads have a lot of pipes that are dripping water. I can hear them in both Landon and Bogart.\n- Have I told you about the P R I V A T E    B A T H R O O M S?\n- Towers Dining is great when you want to get a burger at midnight, in flip flops, which you will. \n- you can tell your professor \"sorry I didn't make it to class today, the elevators broke down while I was in it\"\n\nAddmitably the last one can also be a con but who's counting.\n\nAlso the Quads are closer to Campus Center's dining hall but the Terraces has better food almost always (and open later).",

I also think having it be near the top of the campus made it easier for me to personally have a mental map of where every building was if that makes any sense. Hope you enjoy your first year!",

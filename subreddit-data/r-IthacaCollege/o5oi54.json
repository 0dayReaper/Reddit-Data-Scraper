I\u2019m coming in after being at community college and I was wondering if entering as a junior if you felt like you missed out on opportunities or felt behind? Do you feel like you still made the most out of Park and the connections, internships, job outlook afterwards?",

Having Ithaca and Park next to your name is a good thing for TV. You\u2019ll take the same classes as a 4 year parkie, just more jammed together.",

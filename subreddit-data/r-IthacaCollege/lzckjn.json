They are also directly going against their own Ithaca forever plan posted on their website in multiple ways, proven by a recent ruling by the American arbitration association that the the administration threatened a contingent faculty member",

Or just laying off staff as a cost cutting measure? I\u2019m sure there must be some endowment that could help fund capital investments and training. Disappointing to hear that so many professors seem to be impacted. IC and Cornell are huge employers in the town. \n\nAt the end of the day, they have to do what is right for the college so it stays open. They probably don\u2019t care to hear from alumni such as myself who donate $50 a year.",

When you compare enrollment and retention data for themselves against other peer institutions, IC's numbers are dropping very disproportionately.  There's been little insight or explanation of this. Additionally, those in charge of boosting those numbers back up have, seemingly, been able to wash their hands of the issue and step back and watch this process play out. Meaning all the college's financial troubles are being put on the shoulders of expenses (staff, faculty), and very little onus is on those that could be increasing revenues.",

Or perhaps the perceived ROI on tuition isn\u2019t apparent. Have there been any studies that show where enrollment is declining? I wonder if Park, Dillingham, and other \u201cprestige\u201d programs are isolated. If so, it makes sense why people wouldn\u2019t want to pay $60K a year for a humanities degree. \n\nCan we also talk about how ridiculous that ad campaign is? Amateur hour.",

They haven't produced really any positive yields to speak of, and the folks behind them seem to be effectively immune from responsibility or bearing of these financial troubles.  Look at how paltry the IC Admissions' Twitter account is. There's 145 total tweets since inception, and there were 0 tweets between 5/20 and 11/20. Why isn't the college trying to reach prospective students where prospective students are?!  The summer and fall is when most students and families are narrowing their choices and making their decisions -- and IC Admissions was totally mum.",

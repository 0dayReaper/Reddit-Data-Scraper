    "postText": "Hello Ithacans!\n\n  \nI'm looking forward to attending Ithaca this upcoming Fall, but I'm currently working on a presentation about anti-Semitism on college campuses. This question stemmed after reading into the swastika on the Baker Walkway window when I visited in the wintertime from the Ithacan. Looking into this problem, I realized this problem is much larger than I originally suspected. Anti-Semitism has been on a sharp rise since 2017. And while many people are talking about this rise, I have not seen a lot of discussion towards solutions or at the very least some form of coping mechanism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read that there was a day taken aside all about anti-Semitism on the campus, but was that enough in your opinions?  \n\n\nI was just wondering what you guys had to say. Has Ithaca done enough? If not, what should it be doing?",

            "comment": "Hello, recent IC grad here who was occasionally involved in the Jewish community on campus and minored in Holocaust studies. Over the years, there is always an incident or two regarding an antisemitic act every year or semester. From my time at IC, it has been people vandalizing property with swastikas (spray paint on a building, in marker on a student\u2019s whiteboard, in condensation on the walkway, and pricked into a poster with a thumb tack to name a few). Ithaca College has a problem with antisemitism. But in my opinion, I\u2019m not sure what else can be done. When an incident happens, the president will send out an email condemning it. That always happens. For the most recent cases of the swastika in condensation on the walkway and pricked into a poster in Whalen, public safety will sent a message to all students. There was a day of education that has truly been a long time coming. The first ever email I received from IC after declaring was from President Collado condemning the act of someone spray painting a swastika on campus. \n\nYou may not know since you haven\u2019t attended IC yet, but there were also some Instagram posts from IC students detailing antisemitism they faced on campus. It was anonymous and posted to an account not affiliated with the college or anyone who attends it (if that makes sense). \n\nDo students feel scared? Yes. \n\nAt this point, IC just needs to listen to what Jewish students feel is appropriate action. I can only suggest we keep the Day of Learning a yearly activity because antisemitism won\u2019t disappear from campus and faculty can\u2019t only speak out when an incident occurs.",

Unfortunately I cannot imagine that calling administration and asking to be connected with students with thoughts on this subject would go very well either. \n\nHowever, i appreciate your input! I've gotten some messages so far and things aren't looking up to snuff.",

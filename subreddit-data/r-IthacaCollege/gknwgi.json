My other option is to stay local and save money. A lot have told me there's little difference between SUNY schools and private so any feedback would be helpful :-)",

            "comment": "If you got accepted into a SUNY school of comparable reputation (say, New Paltz or Geneseo), that might be a better option for psychology. I went to IC at first because I was accepted into the communications school, but eventually transferred into the H&amp;S because of my intended career. While I had an excellent experience there and don't regret going, I probably wouldn't have gone initially if I knew was going into H&amp;S - it's just not worth the money for a run-of-the-mill liberal arts degree. \n\nThe town is lovely--I still live here--and the college experience was great. Friendly people, mostly good classes, small enough campus to have a sense of community, etc. But there are SUNY schools with a very comparable experience that would offer equal or better education in psychology for half the price.",

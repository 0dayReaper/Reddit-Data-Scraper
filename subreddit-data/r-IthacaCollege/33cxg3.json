Ten dollars gets you dinner and treats, funky music, and of course fun trivia. Come on your own or bring a team of up to five and try your best. There will be prizes for the winning teams! PM me if you need more information, or just show up at the cafeteria by 6!\n\nThe Brain Team has had an outstanding year in academic quizbowl tournaments both locally and in New Jersey and Massachusetts, and are ranked [3rd in the state and 57th in the world](http://hsqbrank.com/2015/03/08/top-200-high-school-quiz-bowl-teams-3815/).  They've qualified for three national tournaments in Washington, DC and in Chicago, the first of which is this very weekend!  The expenses for these tournaments are significant - we've already spent $3000 in registration, transportation, and hotels. Our trivia night fundraisers go a long way to helping us cover these expenses, and your financial support is critical in helping us continue to perform at a national level.\n\nThank you very much for your continued support, and we hope to see you on Thursday!\n",

    "postText": "I know this question is incredibly overdone, but I\u2019m genuinely curious about how the rising case numbers around Tompkins County (Cornell, etc.) are going to affect life here at IC. I guess I\u2019ll use Cornell as it\u2019s the most prominent example\u2014and because of it\u2019s proximity to us.\n\nCornell updated it\u2019s mask policy to require masks outdoors, which I\u2019ve seen many different opinions about over on their subreddit which I encourage you to go read. The new policy update came from the rising numbers of cases (see: https://cornellsun.com/2021/08/27/cornell-moves-to-yellow-alert-two-days-into-classes/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss | https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/) and the overall speed of testing in relation to contacts.\n\nWhat I see there is an extremely stark contrast to what is (supposedly) the case here at IC. The only reason I say supposedly is due to the oddly low number and my own personal skepticism of real-time updates. (see: https://www.ithaca.edu/covid-health-safety/covid-dashboard)\n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has some insight into how things may change here over the next couple weeks amidst rumours floating around regarding a fully online semester at Cornell as early as September 9.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I can\u2019t speak to any policies/procedures with much merit, as I am not a health professional, but what I can say is that it\u2019s of dire importance we all do our part and stay masked and get vaxxed!",

Our vaccination rate is considerably higher, even though it\u2019s just a five percent rate increase. Just think about how many people 5% is at Cornell\u2019s campus (20,000+ students) compared to 1% of our 6,500 give or take.",

            "comment": "So, o can\u2019t officially tell you what it will be like but I can tell you about what it was like last semester. \n\nFor starters, masks everywhere. Spit tests weekly-this is still a thing for those that aren\u2019t vaxxed, which at this point I believe is staff/faculty only.   Honestly I think they should do this again anyway but I\u2019m sure it costs them $$. You might see stanchions going up in the dining halls, and a return to food being served to you rather than you take your own (this means less hands touching the same surfaces). If THAT happens, it\u2019s gonna be a long wait for your lunches. \n\nI encourage you all to be smart people. None of us want it to be that way and the best way to do this is practice the safe smart habits we\u2019ve all seen in the last two years. Mask up, keep distances, don\u2019t congregate (this means less going out in groups) and if you are felling under, don\u2019t push to be out and about.   Wash yer hands too!  \n\nAlso, to comment on your last statement-I don\u2019t know what monitoring is being done (for anyone) and that may be why CU is reporting higher numbers; better screening and reporting. If anyone this they have the Rona, get a test and put that concern to rest.",

            "comment": "The music school is going through a lot of changes in faculty with people retiring and interim professors leaving at the end of the year as their terms are complete. That will of course impact the quality of education for better or for worse. Most of the faculty is very nice and well educated in their subject matter, though there are also some who are not (but they are pretty few and far between) \nThe band programs all seem to be doing very well, though I can\u2019t speak fully to how well that is as I am a string player, but I have heard great things about the saxophone professor specifically.\nAlso what might be a pro for some and a con for others, Ithaca is definitely a school at which people like to party and for some, that will take precedence over sobriety during performances and rehearsals. Don\u2019t expect a conservatory like approach from Ithaca as you will not get it.\nOverall it is a decent school but it certainly has issues, most of which seem to be in the process of being resolved which is good. Most people do come for music education but there is still merit to the performance program.",

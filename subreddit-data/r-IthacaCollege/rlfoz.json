Quads are okay but Terraces have the biggest doubles out of all 3 and there will more likely be other sophomores or juniors there. \n\nI've heard the business school is really good, and the building itself is pretty nice. Lower Quads are closest to the school, but the walk up to Terraces really isn't all that bad. Plus Terrace Dining Hall is the best out of all 3 options",

I'd say Towers comes in at second because it has Late Night (open from 8-12 M-Thurs). I really really try to avoid Campus Center because it's usually packed and the food isn't that great, but it is the most convenient to go to if you only have a little time between classes. \n\nThen there's the Pub, which has places to buy food using your Bonus Bucks (you usually have somewhere between 100-200 depending on your dining plan). You can get wraps, pizza, Chinese, burgers, etc. That's all nice once in a while, but if you eat there a lot you can see your bonus bucks go really quickly. You can always add more later though. ",

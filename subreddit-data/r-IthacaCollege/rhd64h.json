It's hard to convince a student to take a test if it means going into quarantine for a few days and being unable to go to class online and then waiting to be able to take a covid test.\n\nLet's face it; even people in the cafeterias stopped wearing masks. From students serving themselves food while their masks were pulled all the way down to some of the staff simply not wearing masks.",

Ithaca has some really good in-person education for PT, OT, and such, and it's not that there was no way for Ithaca College to have good safety, but it's just that there were some things that they could have done to make people safer and too many people started getting really lax in the end.",

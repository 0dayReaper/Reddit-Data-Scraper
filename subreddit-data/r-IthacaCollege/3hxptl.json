    "postText": "My brother goes to Ithaca and his freshman year I got an Ithaca Pom Pom hat and it was my favorite winter hat. Then one day after a sweet skiing session I left it on the bus and it was never seen again. I don't know if any of you kind Ithaca veterans or newcomers know where I could get another one of these hats. \n\nThe hat was navy blue, yellow, and white striped with a blue, yellow, and white Pom Pom and had the IC logo on the front. I'll try and post a picture later, I'm currently on mobile. \n\nThis was my favorite hat ever, it fit me perfectly and was so comfy. I lost it almost a year ago and I have been searching ever since. Please Bombers help me. I miss my hat dearly. ",

But, anyways, I managed to look in the store for hats and they have some really nice ones - I bought one myself! (shame shame...) \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf there is one that fits your liking, tell me and I'm sure we can manage to get you it. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/39Nwy",

Its the one with the triangle design. That one looks like it would make for a good replacement.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to do this!",

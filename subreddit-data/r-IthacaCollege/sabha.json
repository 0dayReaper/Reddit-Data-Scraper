    "postText": "I recently decided I'll be attending Ithaca College this fall. I was originally gonna just get a room in one of the Towers, but I've been hearing mixed reviews about them. \n\nMy major is TV-R. I'm taking into consideration proximity to classes, parties, scenic views (although I'm sure everywhere you go is scenic), room sizes, etc. I'm curious about the differences between the Towers, Quads, Terraces, etc. \n\nAlso, is it a good idea to find a roommate via HomerConnect? Or would it be better to try and meet someone?\n\nI'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

When I was an incoming freshman I wanted the towers as well, but couldn't get in a room and ended up getting Landon Hall, even though I had no idea where it was on campus. Landon is the closest residence hall to Park, which is great because I'm a Cinema major, so for you it'd be quite convenient as well. I'm a sophomore and I stayed in the same room from last year, so I'd say Landon or lower quads in general is pretty good for a Park student. Towers seem cool, but they can get annoying when things happen like the elevators going out (which has happened multiple times since I've been here). And terraces I know can be good, they're just a bit of a walk from Park. HomerConnect will probably work fine for a roommate, both the roommates I've had so far I got randomly online and they both worked out well, though if you meet someone and want to live together that's totally cool too. Hope this helps!",

It's mostly freshmen and very close to Park and Williams as well as Campus Center. Towers is pretty overrated I'd say unless you can get a lakeside room at least 7 floors up. You will have no problem making friends in the lower quads. All of the other kids there will be in the same boat as you! I also recommend avoiding the first year program. It limits the friends that you can make, you don't only have to be friends with freshmen. My best friend freshman year was actually a senior. Also they may throw you in Boothroyd, now that's isolation.\n\n-Junior IMC Student",

I lived in freshmen year housing my freshman year and made a ton of friends from all over campus of all years. Sure I made a bunch of friends with everyone I lived in the same building with, but they were not even close to being the only people I hung out with. Where you live could help determine some of the friends you make, but they should not be the only people you hang out with. \n\nAlso, if you seriously take into account walking across campus as a factor, you are in for a rough time. You pretty much will have to walk a lot (up hill and down hill) regardless of where you live. So you shouldn't let that be an important factor of determining where you live. ",

It's just nice having towers dining hall right below you, as well as sub connection, not to mention the fact that a whole lot of you friends will likely live in towers too.  It makes it much easier to see people if its just a floor or two up instead of across campus.  Also it makes late night the best, because you can wander down and eat your fill without really having to get dressed up (especially in the winter time when its cold or snowy).  It is a little far from park, but honestly the walking isn't that bad, and it's pretty good exercise too.",

Upper quads aren't that much further, compared with the entire campus, and are arguably more centralized.  If you forget things in your room a lot?  Go for lower quads, you'll always be running back for hard drives to edit from, camera, lighting or sound gear to return... oh, no no no you're TV-R!  Just go lower quads.  You have to carry all that shit around.  I forgot, I graduated a couple years ago.  Yeah.  lower quads.  And that question about being isolated when not in the towers?  No way.  Know how many kids stay in a dorm, let alone your floor?  Know how many play frisbee in the quads open areas - your front and back yards, basically?  Naw, kid, you're gold.  It's very difficult to be isolated in college, especially if living on campus.\n\nEnjoy TV-R and hit me up if you have any questions!  I was cinema/photo, but they overlap in many ways - in school and in professional life.  I also held various jobs in the TV/ICTV realm (including master control broadcasting, for example) and took video workshop, was friends with many TV-R students, and worked on their projects.  Mix it up if only for extra experience... the worlds are colliding faster and faster, and several TV shows shoot 16mm and 35mm.  Let alone the digital cinema revolution - it's impact-full to all of our lives, no matter the viewpoint an individual has for or against it.\n\nAnyway..rambling ending.  Best of luck to you.  :)",

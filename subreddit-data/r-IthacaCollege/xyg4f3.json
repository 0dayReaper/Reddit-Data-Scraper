I did a year at a community college and then transferred here and planned to get my bachelors/masters here but I've found out pretty quickly this place isn't my vibe. I'm wondering how the psychology major is at IC and what it's like being a transfer student there :)",

Just don't be afraid to put yourself out there and ask questions. Your RA, the info desk at campus center, ResLife, etc are all good resources to find things you're interested in",

I had a really great experience and enjoyed all of my classes and professors, though I can't speak for the psych major because I was mostly in the Park school. But the transfer experience was fine! There's a transfer student seminar that is super easy to pass as long at you turn in the assignments. Lots of cool clubs and activities around campus, and you can't beat the views. Nice people, clean campus. Administration and internal affairs may drive you nuts but that\u2019s college for you. I\u2019m so glad I chose Ithaca overall and met some great people! Good luck and welcome to IC :)",

I have a couple questions if you don't mind. Is transfer housing an option and is it like separated from everybody else? And what kind of assignments were in the student seminar?",

It\u2019s in Terrace 11 and you can apply for it through your housing portal on your IC account. It\u2019s a floor dedicated to transfer students but in the rest of the building is a mix of other students. I didn\u2019t personally live there so I can\u2019t speak on it, but I did live in terraces and it\u2019ll definitely get you in shape if you\u2019re not already LOL As for the transfer seminar, they\u2019re pretty basic assignments that essentially teach you about what a liberal arts education is. You\u2019ll read articles and write like a page response about them. We had to interview a professor for another assignment. Just stuff that informs and gets you involved.",

I now have my phd and am a professor at a uni and my time at IC is what led me here. I really grew a passion for research and psych while there. Dont listen to people who say its not worth it bc its not \"well funded\". The professors and education youll recieve there in the dept is top notch.",

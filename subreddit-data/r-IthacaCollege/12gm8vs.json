    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m debating between two colleges, Ithaca and another school, and was hoping to get some opinions from current students and alumni about the culture and community of the school as a whole. \nI\u2019m planning on majoring in Integrated Marketing Communications, so if anyone has any info on that please do share. Things I\u2019m looking for the most is overall experience, food/housing, classes (difficult or easier than expected), and professors. \nThanks!",

The cost is definitely a huge downside with what you\u2019re getting, dorm and food quality are extremely terrible and definitely my 3 reasons for transferring out of here. You won\u2019t have a bad education if you go here but the school is 10000% not worth the cost imo.",

Since you are coming for one of their signature programs -- and it's legitimately a great and widely recognized program -- I'd give the green light.  The downsides to IC are it's a small school going through some significant financial turmoil right now and there's been a number of concerns about the climate on campus for minorities, but with that said, I don't think you'll find a better IMC program.",

It\u2019s a very special town full of artists, musicians, alternative culture and access to healing arts. I loved IC &amp; they challenged me to be an advocate for myself. It\u2019s a unique experience. I moved back after 6 years in Brooklyn bc it was a safe &amp; affordable place to be. Make sure to get out of town in the winter to seek sunshine, and move off campus as soon as possible to save money.",

Do you work for the college?\n\nProtips to anyone who wants to attend this place: if you want to work in the industry, go to a school in LA like UCLA, USC, or heck even CalArts.\n\nThe center of the entertainment industry is in California, Not BFE New York. At least if you go to a local LA school you can find work immediately after school without having to fly out on a hope and a prayer.",

What if this kid wants a smaller liberal arts college, to be near their family in the northeast, or can\u2019t afford LA (or the flights it will take to get home?) IC offers communications students a semester in LA for internships with major studios and companies. It\u2019s near another center of entertainment \u2014 NYC \u2014 so you can network &amp; move there right after school. \n\nI see your reasoning - did you go to IC and you\u2019re frustrated about your choice?",

Attending IC during the Rochon years was an experience at being nickeled and dimed for an otherwise mediocre college experience. I made the mistake of visiting friends at other colleges across the country which made me realize just how bad IC really was. The worst part is being told that my expectations were, \"entitled\". When a college costs \\~$60k in tuition, not expecting the best of the best means you are a fool at best and being scammed at worst. \n\n&gt;What if this kid wants a smaller liberal arts college\n\nAttend Calarts which is cheaper than IC and local to LA. \n\n&gt;to be near their family in the northeast\n\nGo to a school in the city or tri state area, not mid-central NY which is 4 hours from the city by car with no direct flights. \n\n&gt; can\u2019t afford LA (or the flights it will take to get home?)\n\nIf one can't afford LA but wants to work in entertainment, then I would either pick a new life or learn to live without while getting set up because LA is the center of the entertainment universe. \n\n&gt; IC offers communications students a semester in LA for internships with major studios and companies.\n\nSo do UCLA, USC, and CalArts. \n\n&gt;It\u2019s near another center of entertainment \u2014 NYC \u2014 so you can network &amp; move there right after school.\n\nNYC also pales in comparison to LA and to a lesser extent Georgia when it comes to entertainment industry options while also being thrice more expensive. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, the cost to attend IC is slightly more expensive than attending the 3 institutions, with Calarts being the cheapest. With that savings, a student can then afford the flights to and from the east coast. There are far better and cheaper options if communications is what a student seeks than IC.",

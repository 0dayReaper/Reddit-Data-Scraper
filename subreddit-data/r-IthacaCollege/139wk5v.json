If I end up living in the quads, do you think I\u2019ll still be able to make friends?",

Hanging out with friends I met in my dorm were movie nights and gaming, candy runs to wegmans and Walmart, etc. Our bathrooms never had puke in the mornings, and it was never too noisy to sleep. \n\nAgreed on clubs and majors being the major way you meet people outside dorms. As an introvert I cannot say enough that the Towers are a bad idea: it\u2019s fine to hang out there when you\u2019re in the mood, but you should have a safe space to retreat to when you need some peace and quiet to recharge.",

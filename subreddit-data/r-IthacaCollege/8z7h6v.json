    "postText": "This is an EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PSA:\n\nIf you attend the festival, whatever you do BOYCOTT the African Dance and Drumming workshop (which is happening Saturday afternoon) and tell all of your friends to do the same. Again, BOYCOTT. DO NOT GO!! One of my friends has been assaulted by one of the members of the group (and a leader of the group knows but has done nothing) and wants to remain anonymous, but also wants everyone to know that she feels very strongly about not supporting a group in which that is acceptable behavior. I stand with her. And I'd like you to as well.\n\nI cannot stress enough how important that statement is. DO NOT GO! BOYCOTT the African Dance and Drumming!",

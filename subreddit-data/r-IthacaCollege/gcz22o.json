            "comment": "Well considering I go to Ithaca and my brother goes to Emerson, I can definitely help put a bit here. Honestly when it comes to the education you really can't go wrong with either. Emerson and Ithaca are both fantastic schools for film and just communications in general. The equipment and resources available at each school is extremely high end and plentiful. \n\nHonestly the main thing between the two schools you really have to factor in is location. Ithaca is a beautiful town with a lot of great wildlife and gorges/parks to take in and explore. It's a very good area. Emerson is right in the heart of Boston. The freshman dorm overlooks one end of the Boston Commons. There's really no campus, it's just a block or two of various academic and residential buildings. If youd prefer that sort of city experience rather than a whole campus then maybe Emerson is for you. Cost wise the schools are similar, food from both is also very comparable, education is also comparable. \n\nThe alumni network and networking in general you can gain from the Park School really helps it stand out though, as it can really help down the line in your academic career.",

You can walk from one end to the other in about 10 minutes give or take. And it's really easy to navigate once you familiarize yourself with the area. The town is really nice too, the parks and stuff are awesome in the fall and spring. The winter can be kinda brutal but you're going to school in Central New York so there's not much you can really do about that. \n\nAlso there's a lot of great places to eat in town and the bus station is right off the commons if you ever were to need to travel by bus.",

Background, I went to Ithaca from 2002-2006 and absolutely loved my time there and the life it setup for me, wouldn't change a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two main things that made me apply early decision to Ithaca and not apply to Emerson is Emerson is a great communications school while Ithaca is a liberal arts college that contains a great communications school, so there were people there studying all kinds of things.  The second was the small town feel of Ithaca versus the city of Boson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth schools offer great \"study abroad\" abroad programs in LA, and used to house everyone in the same apartment complex.  I'd highly recommend this, whichever school you go to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're ultimate goal is film in LA, I can tell you that the alumni group out here is amazing! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat negative things have you heard about LA?  Happy to answer any further questions you've got from a older graduate.",

                    "comment": "I agree! One of the reasons I like IC more is because it\u2019s a liberal arts school, not just an arty school. I also am looking more for a town since I am from a big city. The negative things I heard were just a few people mentioning how terrible the food is, or that it is difficult to change ones major, or appoint meetings with counselors. Also, someone had come on the accepted students Facebook page and was talking all about how they felt the school was horrible and everyone should rethink their choice. Everyone has different experiences though. What did you think of Ithaca\u2019s campus and town?",

                            "comment": "Opinions as of 2006 =)  \nFood: Campus food was really good, for college food.  Had friends from high school that went to other colleges constantly complaining about their food but I couldn't related.  There were three main options, campus center which was fine but fast and easy, terraces which were upscale but crowded, and towers which was in the middle.  Also plenty of places to grab a quick bite with campus bucks.  Still miss DP Dough and Wings Over Ithaca late night deliveries.   \n\n\nCampus: There's no getting around that some of the architecture on campus was straight from the energy crisis era, there's a lot of steps, and that the wind blowing up the hill is extremely cold, but you learn to love those things.  The view of the lake from up on the hill were amazing, plenty of open grass areas, and that first warm day when everyone pours out onto the quads, ditching the winter clothes for the first time.  It can be gray for long stretches of time.  \n\n\nTown: I know some chains and big box stores have since moved in, but the town of Ithaca was great.  Thirsty thursday nights at the bowl alley, strolling around downtown, finding your favorite little restaurants, hikes to all of the amazing waterfalls.  It's a pretty great area!   \n\n\nHave you had a chance to tour the campus yet?",

I got accepted into Emerson too and it\u2019s a fantastic school, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be expensive whenever I get my financial aid back. Ithaca could be cheaper, but I wouldn\u2019t know what the financial stuff looks like since I regrettably never applied. Either choice is great though. Good luck!",

One is if you have bad grades, sometimes your options to switch between \"schools\" on campus can be limited, but that is really bad grades (like failing many classes in a row). The other is just if you have already gone so far down a path that switching means that you need to \"start over\" with a lot of prerequisites. Again, none of this is about Ithaca College at all. Outside of that, as another commenter below notes, no problem to change major at IC.\n\nI thought the food was awesome (alumni) but they also have started a new in-house food system in cooperation with Cornell that no longer relies on a big external corporation, so that should be making things better than ever.",

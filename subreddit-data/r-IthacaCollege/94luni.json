            "comment": "I went to Ithaca starting in 2003, graduated with my DPT in 2008. I was lucky to come out of school with only 75,000 in student loans. While I was in undergrad my tuition started at 22,000 and increased by at least 2000 each year. That does not include room and board costs and books. I had a fair amount of financial aid and help from my parents. I loved Ithaca a lot and had great experiences. I have done a lot with my degree but when I pay on my loans each month I wonder if a less expensive option would have been better in the long run. ",

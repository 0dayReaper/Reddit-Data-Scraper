    "postText": "Hi guys, so I just commited to Ithaca for music education, and I really enjoyed working with the trombone teacher and the overall feeling of the music department, but I was wondering if anyone had any comments on what to expect from dorms and what would be a good choice as a freshman. I also heard about the food being not great along with poorly maintained dorms so I'm just worried about what I signed up for. I'm also asian and it seems like many asian kids have experienced a decent amount of racism. Might just be nervous overthinking since people seem to say that things are fine and others say how bad it is. \n\nI'm also just looking for friends and a possible roommate so if anyone has any info I will be so thankful.",

            "comment": "I can speak to the dorms and food. The freshman dorms aren\u2019t bad, they\u2019re better than those of other schools I toured, and they\u2019re some of the largest freshmen dorms I\u2019ve seen, although they\u2019re definitely not the nicest. Other people may have other opinions but that\u2019s mine. Towers are definitely the social dorms. Everyone kinda meets everyone who lives there, although it is very noisy and the walls are super thin, also the elevators break constantly. They do have single bathrooms in the hall though that the other buildings don\u2019t have. The quads are nice, they\u2019re less crowded than towers but do still offer the opportunity to meet people. They\u2019re also a lot smaller (building wise not room size), so things like laundry and garbage are a lot closer. The communal bathrooms are a bit scary going into it, but they\u2019re not bad once you get used to them. Overall there aren\u2019t many issues to expect. I\u2019ve heard stories of rodents but never seen any myself, and ofc there will sometimes be noisy neighbors and weed wafting through the halls but this is to be found at any college. As for which you should choose I\u2019d say it\u2019s down to your preferences. They\u2019re both comparable and you\u2019ll meet tons of people regardless, but towers is definitely more of a social hive than quads.\n\nThe food offerings are okay. They do tend to repeat a lot of the same dishes quite frequently, and don\u2019t offer quite the variety that other large schools might, but they do still tend to have a number of offerings including vegan, allergen free, and kosher. Some dishes are better than others, but overall it is not bad. It\u2019s not quality food by any standards, but it\u2019s not bad. I personally am a picky eater and struggle with the food here, but that is my personal opinion, I know a ton of people who are fine with the food. There have been incidents in the past with extremely undercooked food and some minor other issues, but last I knew the dining hall was working to fix them.\n\nOverall none of it is the best, and by no means quality. The dorms lack the modernity that many other school dorms have, and the food is alright but nothing special. Ultimately it all comes down to what your expectations are. College isn\u2019t gonna be perfect and if you come in expecting everything to be then you\u2019re gonna be miserable when it\u2019s not. Regardless, Ithaca College is a great place, congratulations and welcome to the IC family!\n\nI hope this was helpful, if you have any further questions or want more explanation please feel free to reach out!!",

            "comment": "I am about to graduate, but I'll offer my opinions.  \nI lived in the Upper Quads as a freshman (Holmes Hall!) and really enjoyed my location on campus- you're close to the library/Whalen as well as Campus Center and the pub for food options. Quads is a lot less social than Towers, but I still managed to make several friends within my building. I also picked my roommate- we had both joined an incoming students group chat and ended up rooming together because neither of us wanted to go totally random, and the two of us are still really good friends - I was actually just over at their apartment the other day.  \nThe food isn't bad, but it does get boring. CC is very repetitive, but has the deli bar and decent vegan offerings, but the evening meals are very limited in options- my big meal is usually lunch, because there's more menu variance. The salad bar is there, but inconsistent. Desserts are usually decent, and the offerings from the allergen-free line are not half bad.   \nThe Pub/Food Court is right by CC, and there's a lot of options there that you can get with either real money or Bomber Bucks- I really enjoy ChicknBap bowls, sweet potato fries, and breakfast sandwiches from the Bakery.  \nTerraces is the larger dining hall, and that's where the Good salad bar is. The Terraces options also tend to be more varied.  \n\nI always keep a half dozen eggs and ramen packets in my dorm room and cook them in the kitchen if the dining hall options aren't doing it for me for dinner, and that's usually fine. There's also a number of good off-campus order options, and we get free Grubhub+, so delivery fees aren't awful and murderous. \n\nWegman's and Aldi are both good grocery options.",

            "comment": "The person who said Towers are the most social dorms are dead wrong. My freshman year I lived in East Tower and then moved to Upper Quads halfway through, and I can say with confidence that upper quads had WAYY more of a community feel than towers. Towers is literally just a huge building with 500 kids crammed in. quads feels more homey and nice",

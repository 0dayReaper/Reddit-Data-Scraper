    "postText": "Has anyone read IC student journalist Faith Meckley's articles before praising her efforts?\n\nThis [recent article in The Ithacan](http://theithacan.org/blogs/risky-business/), in which she trespasses and melodramatically scoops up completely safe quartz sand which has nothing to do with fracking -- from the picture, the sand pile looks like it is intended for grading the construction site before a building foundation is laid down, mixing concrete or preventing the truck routes from becoming muddy -- reads like a rejected Scooby-Doo script.\n\nAmong the scientific flaws:\n\n&gt; The sample of the sand I collected looked like every picture of frac sand I had ever seen. It was pristine white, devoid of any coloration, and the grains were smooth and almost perfectly rounded, with some variation. It looked very neat and intentional, not diverse and unruly like your average beach sand.\n\nYes, all quartz sand which you buy for any number of commercial purposes can be sorted by grain size to ensure that the concrete you're mixing dries at the same rate or the site you are grading has the same consistency throughout. You wouldn't want to use beach sand with particles that break down at different rates.\n\n**tl;dr Commercial quartz sand does not equal frack sand.**\n\n&gt; This was no official lab test, and I have no idea how to chemically test the sand to dispel uncertainties, but I\u2019m capable of comparing images and determining if they match.\n\nOkay, it's clear that this person has no idea what she is doing and is engaging in pseduoscience. Where could she haven taken that sand to for a free analysis? What about [Chris Sinton] (http://faculty.ithaca.edu/csinton/), an IC geology professor, or a scientist at Ithaca's [Community Science Institute](http://communityscience.org/) or Cornell's Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department?\n\n**tl;dr Just because commercial sand looks like a picture of frack sand doesn't mean that it is being used as frack sand. I'm certain this sand has nothing to do with fracking.**\n \nMore terrible journalism mixed with pseudoscience:\n\n&gt; **Everyone** told me that the pile of white sand at the rail yard was frac sand. In response, I asked if it had ever been looked at or tested, and **no one** knew. So, rather than assume, **I decided to take on the task myself despite the health risk.** Indeed, there is a pile of frac sand \u2014 life threatening when it enters the lungs \u2014 in the open air, within eye sight of family park and within a couple blocks of a school. Right here in New York State, grand old US of A. **All it takes is a gust of wind, and it\u2019s airborne** and being inhaled by our children and whoever else is unfortunate enough to be around.\n\nWho is \"everyone\"? She obviously didn't interview the property owner or someone on the site, the City Public Works engineers or County Facilities engineers who would be responsible for permitting a sand quarry or borrow pit (if this pile of sand were actually one of those two facilities, which it is not) because, guess what? People in New York are not allowed to dump sand where they wish for use in any commercial/construction operation. It sounds like this \"everyone\" was the clueless and overly paranoid Doug mentioned in the article. And why would she go near the sand if it is even remotely as dangerous as she claims?\n\n\n**tl;dr A tiny pile of sand in the middle of relatively expensive property in an urban area will *never* be a place where frack sand would a) allowed to be stored because of state and local permit and safety requirements or b) desired by industry because it would be stupidly expensive  -- they would source sand from very big pits in rural areas and truck it onto the fracking site or transport via rail.**\n\nThe article was painful to read. Faith is taking credibility away from informed citizens who may have a reasonable arguments against the gas storage expansion. Ignorant, arrogant people like her who use what I would loosely call journalism as a podium for their own narcissism -- read her other articles and it becomes clear that her writing is all about herself, not about the environment -- is incredibly irresponsible and undermines the environmental efforts of citizens who take time to do their research, become informed, and use their opportunity to be heard far more wisely than a silly girl who has no chance of being taken seriously by a government official or someone in the gas industry.\n\n&gt; As we fell silent again, I could feel the tension building. We were **trespassing**, after all. Our ruse of being lost tourists would only last so long. A ** freight truck** had pulled into the rail yard ahead of us, and the driver must have noticed us by now. [...] My heart was pounding as I brushed the excess sand off the jar, and it wasn\u2019t because I was risking trespass charges. **It was because I knew there was a chance I was risking my life.** Once I screwed the lid on, I frantically brushed my gloves off on my pant leg, and then did the best I could to shake the stuff off my pants. A little voice in my head told me that **trying to decontaminate myself was futile, that if I had been smart I would have come here equipped with a mask. It could already be in my lungs.**\n\nAgain, the lack of journalistic ethics and pseudoscience are astounding.\n\nWhy not try interviewing the employees at the rail yard? Why needlessly trespass? Also, Faith thinks she is at risk from completely benign quartz sand but the reality is that the most dangerous thing she did was walk onto an active site without anyone knowing. The greatest risk she faced during this whole misguided adventure was the possibility of being hit by a commercial truck.\n\n&gt; Indeed, there is a pile of frac sand \u2014 **life threatening when it enters the lungs** \u2014 in the open air, within eye sight of family park and within a couple blocks of a school. Right here in New York State, grand old US of A. **All it takes is a gust of wind**, and it\u2019s airborne and being inhaled by our children and whoever else is unfortunate enough to be around.\n\nWhile [silicosis](http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/silicosis/) is indeed a real, serious hazard to people who work without proper protection in sandblasting, mining, construction and fracking, it [generally takes 5 to 10+ years of chronic (daily) exposure](http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/silicosis/understanding-silicosis.html) to very high concentrations of silica dust in order to cause silicosis. She provided no real information on silicosis and didn't know how to determine whether the sand pile presented a risk to residents or, more importantly, use her journalism background to interview someone credible who *could* tell her about the risk. She isn't interested in taking the time necessary to tell an accurate story. She is only interested in causing (false) alarm.\n\nThere is very little health risk to people playing at the nearby park but, if that sand pile is regularly eroding and/or becoming suspended in air then all the local residents need to do is ask the workers to put a tarp on top when they're not planning to use or transport the sand.\n\nThis kind of thing is accounted for in OSHA and NY DEC codes so the residents could avoid communicating with workers at the site altogether and just let the city or county engineers know that there is a problem which need to be corrected. These workers aren't monsters and will probably respond to a simple, valid request pretty quickly.\n\n**tl;dr** This \"journalist\" does terrible, irresponsible work and I wish she wouldn't contribute **pseudoscientific, uninformative nonsense** to an already contentious and difficult issue on which **the public deserves excellent, thoughtful reporting**. Activists who don't get their facts right muddy the conversation and undermine real environmental efforts carefully planned by citizens who are capable of communicating their message and agenda clearly and responsibly in order to enact lasting, positive changes in the community. **Faith's writing and activities are a counter-productive distraction to the real issues.**\n\n",

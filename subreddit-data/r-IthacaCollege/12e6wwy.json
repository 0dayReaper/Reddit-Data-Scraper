It\u2019s a very broad major that covers a decent amount of different stuff. I personally didn\u2019t love it but that\u2019s cause I wanted a career in creative specifically graphic design and they only have a couple of classes covering stuff like that. I would say if you don\u2019t have a clear vision of the career you want but it\u2019s related to marketing, pr and advertising i would recommend it. On the other hand if you want something pretty specific I would look at another program",

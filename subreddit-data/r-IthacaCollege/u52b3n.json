Should a student need testing or medical attention when the Health Center is closed, the normal process of seeking care at one of the urgent care centers in Ithaca or at the Cayuga Medical Center should be used.\n\nI can't find anything super specific, but all signs point to calling the Hammond Health Center at 607-274-3177. Good luck.",

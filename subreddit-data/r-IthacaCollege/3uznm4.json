This is separate from the *faculty* grievances (they also voted no confidence), which appear in this [Humanities and Sciences Open Letter](http://theithacan.org/opinion/open-letter-hs-faculty-argue-for-rochon-no-confidence-vote/).\n\nIn general, if you're not on campus, please don't read national news about this topic! Remember how good the journalism school is and read *The Ithacan*, it's a berjillion times better.",

In my opinion it should look more like 35.75% of students polled voted in no confidence for president Rochon. The other 64.25% either don't mind him or don't care enough to get engaged. That being said, roughly 2,000 students explicitly against him is not an insignificant number. Even more so when they are backed by the faculty.",

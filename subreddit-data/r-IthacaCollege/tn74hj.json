    "postText": "Hey freshman here having problems with ICTV. Is ICTV supposed to get better with time? I was so excited to go to IC and join ICTV then I get here and, I apply to shows and never get an email back, (not even a rejection email? Cmon!) I was on a show in the fall and was belittled and the producers constantly did my job for me and never let me do it despite me knowing how. A show I tried to get on this semester fell apart before it even started. I was so excited to finally do what I did for four years at the college level and all I get is, disrespect, belittled, my job done for me, and no communication. Is this supposed to get better or is this just what my life will be like for four years.",

I\u2019m a few years gone from ICTV but if you think there is a problem, and you clearly do, talking to the people in charge should help. Station manager can only do so much so Jeremy and Paul might be the best option",

Basically, it was good for me to have a car because I'm from Ithaca and going into my freshman year I had a lot of things to do in and around the area. Also, I already had the car and it would have been dumb to leave it across town in my parent's driveway. \n\nThe thing is, most freshmen don't need to leave campus that much, and the buses are fine for getting to and from campus, downtown, and the shopping district. And, you're probably going to be living in Upper Quads, Towers, or Terraces and freshmen can only park in like Y or Z Lot or something, which is on absolutely the bottom edge of campus. I lived in Emerson, which is right next to that lot, but I saw several poor freshman who would have to trudge all the way up the hill from Z Lot to the Towers.",

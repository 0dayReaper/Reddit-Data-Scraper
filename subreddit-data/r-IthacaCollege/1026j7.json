As many of you may or may not know, [Giorgio Tsoukalos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_A._Tsoukalos), the host of the program, is an alumnus of Ithaca College.\n\nOn his twitter, he [recently noted](https://twitter.com/Tsoukalos/status/244521769057275904) that he would be a guest speaker at a college if the administration merely invited him.\n\nFrom listening to him speak about topics, not necessarily related to his program, I believe he would be a fantastic guest speaker. Since he *is* in the television industry, he could be a potential speaker at a Spark class for Park students, or even for the whole college.\n\nThoughts?",

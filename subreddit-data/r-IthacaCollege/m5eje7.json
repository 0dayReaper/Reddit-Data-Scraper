It's a big decision for me and my family as the cost of attendence is wayyy too high. \nI'm wondering if Ithaca college is worth the money as it is in the middle of nowhere and i have heard some very bad reviews. \n\nI don't mean to be disrespectful to anyone, i just want an honest opinion. Thank you :)",

IC  has just laid off 140+ faculty and is \"resizing\" ie making classes bigger. The administration has made several changes recently that will dramatically change the feel of IC. The cost of tuition is not worth it imo. If the price is already an issue I would really encourage you to look at other schools.",

There are plenty of competitive programs out there at schools that aren't axing wide swaths of their programs.  I hope they can get their act together.",

The college is also a great institution, however it is currently undergoing remarkable stress and instability. For a business degree, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. If you were looking to pursue one of Ithaca College's signature programs, that may yield a different discussion -- but for a business degree?  Keep looking.",

Nearly all graduate programs at SoM are being cut, so your time at IC would be limited to just the four year degree. If that's your goal anyway, then, again, it's probably worth moving forward.",

I entered as an undecided student and didn't really know what I wanted to do but I ended up in Computer Science and I honestly wish I had gone somewhere else just to maximize what I could learn in the department relative to how much I was paying. IC is very humanities and music heavy and it's quickly apparent that that's where most of the budget goes. The town and vibe is nice especially if you're a snow person, but the price is still just so high. Unless you can get fat scholarships I would pass.",

If you are not enrolled in Ithaca yet, an you didn\u2019t get a fat scholarship I would leave Ithaca as a lower choice on your college options",

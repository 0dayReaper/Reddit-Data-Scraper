    "postText": "The IHS Brain Team, Ithaca High School's academic quizbowl team, is hosting a trivia night in the IHS Cafeteria on Thursday, November 17th. Ten dollars gets you dinner and treats, funky music, and of course fun trivia. Come on your own or bring a team of up to five and try your best. There will be prizes for the winning teams! PM me if you need more information, or just show up at the cafeteria by 6! Our Facebook event page is here: https://www.facebook.com/events/186294325163581\n\nWe're only two months into the 2016/2017 season and the Brain Team has been seen a packed and successful schedule. With appearances at tournaments hosted at Princeton, UPenn, Rutgers, and Yale, as well as unofficial appearances at tournaments hosted in Canada and at Penn State, the team has already qualified for two national competitions in Atlanta, Georgia and Chicago, Illinois. With a win at Yale's ACF Fall, a college-difficulty tournament, and a 4th place finish at Princeton, the A team has been working hard to earn its 8th in the nation ranking (www.hsqbrank.com).\n\nWith several more tournaments on the calendar, including attempts to qualify for the National History Bee and Bowl, the team must raise funds for registration fees as well as transportation and lodging for national competitions. Every year these costs total up to more than $3000 and while the school district does support the team to an extent, the primary source of funds needed come from student fundraising. We hope that you will be able to come and support our club!",

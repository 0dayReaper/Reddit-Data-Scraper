I also started in January and am not part of the Sodexo crew nor am I a holdover-I\u2019m the new person on the scene and have little illusions about what it was or is, but know what it can be. \n\nUnderstand that collegiate dining is a monster of a job. Feeding all of you takes enormous logistical effort that in this new COVID age isn\u2019t any easier. Making changes on a large scale takes time but even more importantly, opportunity. Ironically, COVID has forced dining services to overhaul things in a few places and it only leads to better service. \n\nI can tell you that IMHO the best dining hall is Terraces. The chef there came from Cornell and he Knows. His. Shit.\n\nLate night will return. I don\u2019t know when. \n\nSome of the satellite retail cafes will reopen with overhauled menus. \n\nThe Food Court is also undergoing evolutions of change-larger changes will likely happen in the fall. \n\n\nLast, it is totally ok to be critical of the food. It is. You paid for it (or will be paying for it). What is important to remember is that criticism has to be given in a constructive manner. Saying \u201cliterally the worst in the universe\u201d is hyperbolic and doesn\u2019t tell us anything that we can work with to change. We\u2019re happy to make it better.",

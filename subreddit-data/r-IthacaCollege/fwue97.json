I visited a friend at Ithaca college during the winter and this was frozen over next to my car. It was near the terraces so I figured someone lost it. if you know anyone who's missing this or lost it please let me know!\n\nEdit: I believe I was in Ithaca sometime in late February, if that helps anyone figure out when they may have lost this\n\nContents:\n\n- Green, purple and blue pouch (fits in my hand)\n- 5 mini figures (about the size of a quarter each), made our of yarn and other material\n\nedit: spelling and details",

If you are not doing music, physical therapy, or in the park school it is not worth it. professors are leaving departments and departments can't get people to sign on with low rates. the dining and residences are nothing to write home about. if you are looking for psychology i would look at top psych programs in the states, and then narrow down by financial aid offered to you and student satisfaction (dining and residence)",

    "postText": "Hey y'all! I'm an incoming Parkie planning to come this fall! I'm not quite fully committed to Ithaca for just one reason: The BIPOC experience.\n\nWhen I went to Ithaca Today on Saturday, I felt like a drop of color in a sea of white paint. I was expecting to be in the minority as a student of color, but not in the way I thought I did. I didn't feel like I specifically was targeted or anything *because* I was Asian, but I did feel a little lonely that I didn't see any other minorities that much period.\n\nFor a college that says it is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion on its grounds and heavily featuring students of color on their promotional material, it does feel disingenuous when that's not the reality. In fact, I had a student come to my entire tour group during Ithaca Today passing around a pamphlet with bad experiences of just existing in IC and an admit tell me that \"Ithaca's pretty diverse\" and it almost made me laugh. (I just realized that he was talking about the town and not IC, so that is on me for not listening clearly.) Their marketing and the reality was night and day.\n\nOf course, that at least proved the strength of their IMC program here (this is a joke, btw), but I still could not shake the fact that I might go crazy if I stay on campus and let myself be whitewashed to oblivion. (Again, that is a joke, but still a concern for me.)\n\nThe plan for me is to come to IC and stick it out for the year. I got a good scholarship and got admitted into their signature program, so why not? I really just made this post to hear out the stories of other BIPOC students and their experiences.",

I felt way more informed because of them and they deserve the credit for trying to make race a more spoken topic. (Although it did feel weird at first that I was the first person they gave the pamphlets to within my tour group, but c'est la vie.)",

It really made me reflect that i hadnt learned much in class at all. and as a non bipoc student\u2026. i had a LOT of issues with professors. you do you but thats what i feel",

            "comment": "I didn't go through it myself, but i know several \"Parkies\" and many of them ended up with very successful careers in different filmmaking fields. One is an independent filmmaker at this point, one works as an editor for MLB Network, another works for a film production company out of DC i believe, a couple are professional photographers, etc. There's a great mix of theory and hands on production (I helped a buddy film a music video for one class and a commercial for another) and even a \"film festival\" at the end of each semester that's REALLY fun to attend. There's an option to do a semester (or full year? I don't remember which) in LA which everybody raves about. I highly recommend the Park School (again, even as an outsider. I started in film at San Diego State and, had I not switched to writing when I got to Ithaca, I would've done the Park School for film hands down)",

            "comment": "Disclaimer: I'm not a Parkie (Park School student) but most of my friends are. The cinema-photo program is definitely production-focused. Basically, it's all geared toward getting students jobs in the industry. There are many opportunities for networking, internships, etc\u2014you just need to be proactive. \n\nIn terms of theory, there aren't that many critical theory classes imo but if you want to take them I think they're all very high quality. The Intro to Film Aesthetics &amp; Analysis is really in-depth and worthwhile. I think cinema-photo majors have to take it.\n\nAnd like the other commenter said, students can do a semester in Los Angeles. A lot of people have started internships there and stayed after graduation.\n\nI'm a current student so if you have any more questions I can try to answer them or pass them on to one of my friends in the program. I'm personally majoring in Screen Cultures AKA film studies, it's not in the Park school but I've taken almost every film/media theory class that Park offers.",

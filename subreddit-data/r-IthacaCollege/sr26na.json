Let\u2019s assume that my family doesn\u2019t earn any money or pay taxes. I can pay up to 5k as an international student, and I wonder what I should expect from the need-based grant? I know I already received a lot of aid, but still, I need 61k in total.",

That would appear to be a full ride at IC and I don't see that happening. I think another 10k may be available, but expect your bill to be between 20k-30k a year.",

Of course you should work with the Financial Aid Office at IC, but I think you are expecting another 23k on top of the already 29k you are getting which I don't think will happen unless you have an outstanding talent that IC really wants you. Good Luck as IC is an incredible college.",

I actually have a ton of experience with IC and financial aid and have never heard of 100% aid. I would think that you will need at least 20k a year to attend. If you do well, you will get more aid each year so your total bill will not be 80k for four years. I think it is realistic to say your total cost at IC for four years to be somewhere in the 50k neighborhood. If you are looking for 100% aid, you will have to look at a Swarthmore type college.",

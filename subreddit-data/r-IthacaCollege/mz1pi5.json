I\u2019m going to be a music major and I\u2019m nervous about leaving home, as well as all the work it\u2019s going to be for my major. Are all the good experiences worth it, and what are they? Like why do people like it here?",

You\u2019ll see there\u2019s a lot going on with administration, but if you\u2019re looking a caring community the school of music is for you.",

            "comment": "also music ed major here. yeah the admin of IC as a whole is.....kinda sus, but the music school itself is amazing, and profs really do care about you and your learning. i'm from really far out of state, but everyone is really supportive and if you make the effort to get to know other music majors, it can definitely feel like a second family.\n\nthat being said, it is definitely a lot of work regardless of your major. for music ed majors, the music school partners with a lot of the local schools/educational programs, so there's a lot of opportunities right from your first year. it's a bit of a double edged blade since you have to get good at balancing your time and knowing when to say no to this or that performance/observation/masterclass/elective class. same goes for all the other music majors. but this basically helps you practice life skills you need as a professional, so i'd say its just good practice!",

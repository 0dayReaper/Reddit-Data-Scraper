    "postText": "I'm a sophomore that's thinking of transferring to Ithaca for the writing for film &amp; TV major since I'm a big fan of writing stories, especially screenplays.\n\nI got really excited when I heard about ICTV and the creative media organizations on the tour since I would love to write a script that actually gets used. But when I looked at [the website](https://ictv.org/shows/#Scripted) I only found like 5 TV shows, everything else was stuff like news shows. Are their opportunities to use my (fiction) scripts at Ithaca?\n\nI was also curious about people's experience with the semester in LA, the website is pretty vague which makes sense since it looks like everyone gets a different internship but I would like some concrete examples if anyone has one.\n\nwhat is campus like? I'm an introvert and not really interested in alcohol or other substances. I know Ithaca isn't a party school, but I have heard that there is a fair amount of drinking.\n\nFinally, is there a frisbee team? I absolutely love playing the sport and would miss it if it wasn't there.\n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to answer!",

            "comment": "What type of genre for your script writing are you thinking about doing? ICTV is entirely volunteer run after school and after homework so you're very much limited by your peers' ability to put out a script and content. If you're interested in writing I would find a group of film makers and make a short film / movie script with them because you can commit more resources over a longer period of time.\n\nAs for the LA program, placement in an internship (and a job from it post graduation) isn't guaranteed. You have to hunt for the internship yourself. Yes the la program has some handy which you can apply yourself to but don't limit yourself to just the pool there. Use Mandy.com or other places to find internships. Most these days should pay minimum wage which is great.\n\nThe best use of the LA program is to do it as your spring semester your senior year. That way you have a temporary landing pad for finding work immediately post graduation which is a far better use of the program. \n\nYou can fly back and walk with a cap and gown for mom and dad if you really want but if they don't care then I wouldn't bother. You don't walk across the stage, there's no real orchestra playing pomp and circumstance,  you don't get to shake the president's hand like every other uni out there, and the speaker is always a no name alumn.\n\nWith that all said, I would seriously 100% ride as many horses so to speak as you can when it comes to any job in the industry. Right now AI like stable diffusion and language models  are posed to seriously decimate most creative work. I'm specifically talking about ChatGPT. This isn't to say that you're not talented but the studios are always looking for ways to cut anybody at anytime. \n\nMy advice is, you may have your heart in script writing but don't be surprised if you end up somewhere completely unrelated to script writing. The goal should be getting any job in the industry, entertainment that is. \n\nAlso seriously consider your post college debt load. Anything more than $20k (even 15k) and that will seriously be a huge burden in your post college life for at least 5-10 years as your starting wages in the industry will probably be less than 40k a yr. You can make the monthly payments less onerous with the various tricks that the federal government does with repayments but that only makes your total debt load balloon further which further enslaves you as a debt donkey.\n\nDon't make that mistake like so many others.",

With the exception of comedy because I'm not very well equipped to write on that front. \n\nFor finding a group of filmmakers, is that something that happens at Ithaca? Like do students get together and make a movie, and if so why isn't it part of ICTV?\n\nThe tip of doing my LA semester at the end is actually really smart and not something I would've necessarily thought of, thanks for the tip!",

You might be able to get a crew together and film on the weekends but time is valuable which is why fiction shows on ictv are far and few between. That is to say, you can lead the charge in changing that.\n\nMaking friends with the film students is easy and they're easy to find. Happens all of the time and yes they do get together and make movies but they're part of larger projects for grades. By the time I graduated I knew more film students than I could count. They were better company than the tvr kids. \n\nAs for why it's not part of ictv is anyone's guess. As they say, be the change you want to see in the world \ud83d\ude01",

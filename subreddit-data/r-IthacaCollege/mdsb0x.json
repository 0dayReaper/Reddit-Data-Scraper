    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just found out the Ithaca College page. I have read a few of your posts already, but considering I have an assignment about IC, I still have these following questions for you : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.  How are journalism studies organized in the USA?   \nHow many years, how many points for a degree?\n\n2.  Studying in a famous school: good and bad sides? \n\n3.  The career of a journalist from the university (do you have lots of internships to complete? what do you get in response when you send your resume to a press editorial board?)\n\n4.  Can your lecturers connect you to a media if you\u2019re in a case where you have only negative answers for your internships? \n\n5.  How would it be seen if you were to do your internship in another state than your university? What about overseas?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks per advance for those of you who will be ok to answer me !!\n\nC.",

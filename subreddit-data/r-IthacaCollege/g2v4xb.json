Music performance is very good, two ensembles performed at Lincoln Center last spring, with another scheduled for next spring fingers crossed.   There are around 500 students in the program and there is a vibrant feeling in Whalen under normal circumstances, with classes, rehearsals and students practicing a wide range of music.",

I really hope my experience is as good as the experience given to me by the faculty I know there. Just worried; thats all.\n\nThanks!",

The biggest hit SoM got was to the music masters programs, which basically got rid of all MM programs except Music Education. This is a huge loss, because the grad students were so influential to the experience and environment of Whalen (and taught classes for FREE, which means the school is going to have to pay people to teach the programs they originally taught...seems counterintuitive if you ask me...).\n\nAdditionally to negotiating no faculty cuts, music admin managed to keep the grad programs running for the next three years (grad program lives until 2023-24 year), so this won\u2019t effect you right away. \n\nIf you\u2019re an undergrad your music curriculum will not be impacted. The campus will definitely be grieving and adapting to all the cuts that are currently happening, and you may feel that when you\u2019re here, but the undergrad music program remains untouched.",

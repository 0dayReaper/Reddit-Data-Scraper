    "postText": "I'm really close to committing to Ithaca College because I saw that their Musical Theatre program is excellent. I am a little hesitant though because of the negative comments I see everywhere about the food, dorms, and issues about race and people transferring to other colleges because of it. What are your thoughts on this? Is it worth it to go to IC for their MT program?",

            "comment": "the food and dorms are not nearly as bad as people would make you think. they aren't *great*, but they are not nearly as bad as people act like they are.\n\ni'm assuming that you've been accepted to the program- it really is excellent! the social/political/cultural issues are frankly not any worse here than they are at other schools. ithaca's definitely struggling financially a bit and the effects can absolutely be felt (my minor was effectively cut because the professors were all fired or left). it is going to feel more worthwhile if you're getting a significant amount of financial aid like i did.\n\nmy recommendation to you would be to do your best to take non-theatre (or at the very least non-MT) courses during your time- it'll help alleviate a lot of what feels weird at the front end and will prevent you from feeling isolated from the campus at large. there are so many opportunities to get involved in so many things, including activism if you so choose. \n\ni have loved my time in the theatre department @ ithaca. i feel like i have gotten a lot out of it, and a lot of people graduating from the department are leaving with jobs or at the very least plans to get jobs, with the experience and training to back up their auditions and applications. field studies as a senior was hugely important to that- i think it's one of the most beneficial parts of being in the theatre department.\n\nin the end: it is your decision, and you should absolutely think about it and make the decision based on what you think is going to be best for you.",

I fear that the quality of education might get affected and your comment, in a way, proves it.\n\nAnyway, I'll take note of what you said in case I choose IC. I appreciate your honesty! \u2764\ufe0f",

Their performing arts programs are definitely included in that fairly short list (along with the communications programs and medical professional programs).\n\nAll this said though, I don't know that attending college (especially an expensive, private, liberal arts school) for musical theater is a reasonable plan in our world's economy now.",

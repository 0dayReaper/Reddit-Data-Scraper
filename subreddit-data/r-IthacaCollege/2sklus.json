If you don't get a big scholarship, you're better off going to a less expensive school for Economics, or a school that is famous for its program.\n\n(I went to IC for Television-Radio...class of 2007.)",

I don't know if it is an option for Economics majors, but as a politics major I was able to knock of micro and macro economics credits through a community college. Perhaps that would save you some cash and alleviate some of the issues u/RichardStash99 talked about. It's all the same shit wherever you go anyway.",

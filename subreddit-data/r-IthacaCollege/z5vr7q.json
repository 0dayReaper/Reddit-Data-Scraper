    "postText": "So I\u2019m planning to apply to the performance section of Ithaca and I have very little time and I\u2019m not sure if I should do the theatre studies application or the acting one? The acting application will take me a bit to memorize, try to find a monologue in my age range (because it has to be in your age range apparently), and find a headshot. That shouldn\u2019t be *too* bad, but my question is will I be allowed to switch to acting BFA if I got in for the theatre studies major? And I also wanted to ask how different are the majors in terms what i would be learning/doing for both.",

Review the sample curriculum and compare the two programs: how behind would you be if you didn\u2019t take the BFA curriculum in year one in regards to voice and movement (and exposure to the faculty who would have to make the decision to cast you in a show or approve you to transfer in). \n\nWhat is your goal after college?",

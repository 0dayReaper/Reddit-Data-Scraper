    "postText": "So there was some discussion on /r/ithaca about doing a meetup for global meetup day, and it seemed like the best idea would be for /r/cornell, /r/ithaca, and /r/ithacaCollege to have a combo meetup, as there are fewer people from the colleges here this summer, and the more the merrier. With that, I went about organizing it. It is going to be Silky Jones down on the commons, at 8 PM this coming Saturday (the 23rd).\n\nMeetup thingy: http://redditgifts.com/meetups/global-meetup-day-meetup/\n\nI've cross-posted this to /r/ithaca and /r/cornell\n",

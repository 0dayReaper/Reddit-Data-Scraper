    "postText": "Actually I am a bit confused about the housing cost and options on campus. I mean, on the college website, the cost of a single room is mentioned as around $10,370. But they haven't mentioned the cost according to housing location, like out of terraces and quads. \nNow I am confused whether the cost of a single room is same in terraces, quads, and so on. So can anyone help me with this.\n\nAlso, can anyone tell me how big are the single rooms, or if I can find any images/videos somewhere, because the dorm tour videos on YT are mostly old, and even out of them many are of shared rooms. \n\nThanks |:^)",

            "comment": "I believe they are all the same price, but if you are a Freshman, I think it will be hard to get one. It's been quite a few years since I went there, but that is how it was when I went. They are on the small side, but big enough to live and enjoy. If you are a Freshman, I would highly recommend having a roommate. Oh, you will absolutely love IC!",

As for single rooms for freshman, they are incredibly small. You can find photos on the Ithaca website I believe of single rooms in quads and towers. I had a single in lower quads my freshman year and it was the best option for me",

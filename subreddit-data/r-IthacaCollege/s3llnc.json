    "postText": "So I\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with celiacs disease, however my one big fear is being able to eat on campus. I know we have station 8 and all that but I\u2019m just curious to see if anyone else on campus eats gluten free and how they manage (bc we all know the dining hall food sucks). If you eat gluten free/are on a special diet, do you cook for yourself often? Or do you find yourself using the dining halls? Do you find that access to gluten free food on campus is adequate? My one big worry is cross contamination with other foods, especially with the on campus restaurants. The more I think about it, the more my meal plan seems bogus considering my options are extremely limited in comparison to what someone on a regular diet can have.\n\nTy in advance",

    "postText": "Hi I'm a senior in high school looking at IC and I'm going to be majoring in music education. I'm not great with math and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on which classes to take to satisfy my math Gen Ed credits? Also FYI my last math I've done in high school is trigonometry, I did an AP computer science course this past year which counted as a math class and I'm not doing a math class this year so I can have as much time to practice my instrument during school. \n\nThanks!",

When I was there (13ish years ago), the politics department was certainly not one of the more prestigious programs there, but it wasn't anything to scoff at. I took a few politics courses, and the professors were interesting and knowledgeable. However, while Ithaca is quite a liberal college (and area) overall, the politics department had some of the most openly liberal/biased teachers who did not seem remotely bashful about expressing their political views. I don't know if that's appropriate for the program or not, but it was palpable. I'm also not passing judgment on whether that makes the program good; I just thought it's good to know. \n\nAs for the college itself, I have nothing but good things to say. I loved my time there.",

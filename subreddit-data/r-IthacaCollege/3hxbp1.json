I worked at Wegmans back home and transferred stores here (that might have been a mistake, we'll see). \n\nI bought the $500 parking pass because I have a car. But I guess I need to call the TCAT to get picked up where I live? I don't really know. I'm in Dryden off RT 13 and there's a stop on my little road, tried using the app and that's what it said.\n\nI almost forgot about the meal pass. I thought it was through homer connect. I'm out right now, I'll have to check when I get home.\n\nBut thanks!\n\n",

Between this and parking I wish there was a cheaper options. I'm paying for this on my own, kinda suck.\n\nAlso I wanted the TCAT to be able to go downtown to drink and not worry about driving. That's why I mentioned it. ",

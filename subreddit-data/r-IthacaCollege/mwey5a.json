Although I wasn\u2019t part of that major, I knew several people who were and ended up getting excellent internship opportunities that helped set them up for success. \n\nDillingham is one of the preeminent theater schools in the country, so you can rest assured knowing that there\u2019s a high quality of talent and education there. If you\u2019re still undecided, you should contact admissions and see if they can connect you with the recent alumni from the TAM program.",

I think the benefit of this program is that it is half business/ half theater so the classes and knowledge are really universal to other industries as well. One of my TAM friends now works for Google! I do think its one of ICTAs strongest programs, and you get immersed in it right from the start, plus a built in college job selling theatre tickets so that's pretty sweet. \n\nI don't know anything about DePaul's theater program, but just knowing that it is in a larger city, its definitely a different atmosphere. I chose Ithaca because i wanted an enclosed college experience. Many of my friends chose to go to school in cities because they wanted to be part of a city. Ithaca is far away from a lot of places (NYC is about 4 hours) so if being secluded isn't really your jam, then it would not be the place for you. That being said, even though it is secluded, there is a lot to do, its definitely not boring, and is surrounded by nature if you're into that ;)",

            "comment": "The TAM major is incredible, gives you lots of real-life experience and you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to get a job after graduation. I was a TAM and then switched to B.A. Theatre Studies so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s changed since I\u2019ve been there (graduated in 2019) but the one downside to being a TAM is that you won\u2019t have much of a social life aside from your fellow TAMs. They expect so much of you and you\u2019re going to be working a LOT of crazy hours that are required for your degree. If you\u2019re the type of person who likes to be busy (or overworked in my opinion) and if you\u2019re super organized, this is the major for you! It was not for me lol. The other side of this is that all the TAM\u2019s from my year have jobs at excellent theatres and I do not lol. But I also chose a different path.",

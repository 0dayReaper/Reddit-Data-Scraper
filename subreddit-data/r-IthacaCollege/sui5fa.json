    "postText": "Hey, I hope you guys are doing well.\nActually, I was researching about some stuff in Ithaca College, and was curious to know how's the wifi like in the dorms, especially the tower(edit: terrace) area. I read some posts where people were complaining about poor connection speed and so on. \n\nAlso, I haven't yet confirmed my acceptance and am yet to submit my deposit, so I still don't know about how to get a single dorm room. I will really appreciate if someone can tell me. \ud83d\ude05",

    "postText": "Hello, I'm a film student transferring out of one of the SUNY programs, I live in Ithaca so I could go to Ithaca College for next to nothing, however.. that requires me to live in Ithaca at home and I feel like I won't branch out as much as I would at a farther away college. I've also seen some negative things about cuts and what not going on at IC, Anyone within the park school with a focus on fictional narrative related work have any insights on the college?",

Debt is an incredibly heavy burden that very few students really understand going into their education. Avoid as much of it as you possibly can. **Starting your career with only 20k in debt vs 100k in debt could allow you to get your feet under you a decade or two earlier in your life.**\n\nDebt prevents you from taking any risks. You have to stick to jobs you might hate because it pays the lender. Debt blocks you from having the money to take advantage of opportunities to travel or explore yourself. \n\nYour time to branch out is ***after*** college, not during college.\n\nIf you're into film, the school is hard to beat. Lots of networking opportunities available too besides the faculty and facilities on campus. The school itself has a pretty great relaxed atmosphere for students. \n\nThe cuts primarily impacted small unique programs that unfortunately were not bringing in students and money. It's definitely a loss to the EDU world but Park is not nearly so impacted. They did lose some of their tech operations staff to transfers/retirements during the pandemic hiring freeze, so the workload for the remaining techs is higher.  That may change as the pandemic winds down and the economy revives itself.",

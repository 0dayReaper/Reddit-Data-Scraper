    "postText": "Her latest article - https://theithacan.org/news/majority-of-ic-faculty-vote-no-confidence-in-tom-rochon/ - gives no reporting or credence to the fact that a handful of ornary students haggle their president, refused to let him speak, and eventually unplugged the mic he was trying to use. She quoted a staff member saying \"The president\u2019s behavior at Friday\u2019s event was an excruciating public spectacle...\", yet the spectacle was created by the students, not Rochon. He was afforded no opportunity to answer even one question. So where is this young lady's journalistic integrity? Where is the other half of this article?",

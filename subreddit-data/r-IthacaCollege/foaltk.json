            "comment": "Some of the dorms suck ass. I\u2019m a freshman in towers. Big fan. Towers feel more like apartment buildings than dorms to me tbh. The individual bathrooms are huge plus and they\u2019re just newer. It would probably suck if you got one of the higher floors tho as sometimes the elevators just aren\u2019t reliable. Also request a corner room with a lake view if you can. Corner is gonna get you waaay more space and the lake view, while many people think the lake is the best part, will give you a lot less noise at night (coming from a 5th floor kid who\u2019s got the parking Lot side).\n\nPeople always say the food sucks... and yeah I mean it\u2019s not great, but the food I had at home wasn\u2019t always the best either so maybe I\u2019m just used to it, but personally I think people just like to hate on it for the sake of it. The vegan options are usually great. Normally Better than the reg. stuff if you ask me. And I\u2019m not even vegan. Only problem is the the dining halls could be open a little later. \n\nWalking isn\u2019t **that** bad if you remember how fucking big some other schools are. Takes me maybe 10 minutes to get to the other side of campus while it takes my friend at MSU 20 minutes (including a bus ride) just to get to a class. However the campus is pretty hilly one way and it\u2019s cold as shit half the time so the walking will feel worse than it is. \n\nOther person pretty much nailed the academic/party/club scenes imo.\n\nEdit: I think the nature/hiking was kinda undersold by the first comment. I mean if you\u2019re not all that into nature then maybe it\u2019s not that big of a deal, but holy shit the surrounding area is beautiful and you don\u2019t have to go far at all for it. And there\u2019s a shit ton of different spots too. \n\nAlso some of the events in the commons/downtown area are great! Porch Fest, Wizarding Weekend, Apple Fest, Farmers\u2019 Market etc. Admittedly all of those with the exception of Porch Fest (and WW if you\u2019re **really** into Potter/Fantasy shit) are just excuses to get good food with a cool atmosphere.",

            "comment": "Pros: very good theater arts school, good communications, business, psychology, and TV/R/Media Training education. The bars are popping and most of them don\u2019t scan or allow people with fakes in, there are hella sports teams to be on if ur interested in that, lots of clubs and ways to get involved on campus, great concerts come by every year (I\u2019m a junior, and since I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve seen Bob Dylan, Vince Staples, Doja Cat, DNCE, etc.), you can take classes at Cornell with no additional charge and access all the cool shit they have, very pretty natural lands, tons of hiking trails, and there\u2019s a decent amount of stuff to do compared to most college towns, significantly less sexual assault on campus than average, very liberal and accepting, LGBT+ friendly and POC friendly (even though I will say there does need to be some work on both of those fronts by individual members of the campus community), great professors, individualized attention from teachers/smaller class sizes, SAS is very proactive with you etc.\n\nCons: Sometimes the leadership makes dumbfuck decisions, it\u2019s really cold and snows a lot, but as someone who hates the cold it\u2019s manageable, the party scene can be kind of hit or miss. It depends on if there\u2019s people who throw down and who you know, so def get a fake if you\u2019re into that sort of thing. If you\u2019re not majoring in theater, business, or are in the park school it\u2019s much harder to make friends bc those schools have all sorts of mixers and encourage collaboration between students more so than any other school, even tho I\u2019m a political science major with Autism and have done just fine making and keeping friends. Some people can be pretentious, fake, and privileged to an irritating extent, especially the hipsters (you\u2019ll know them when you see them), but those people get progressively easier to avoid, the food is god awful, but it\u2019s the same case pretty much everywhere, the dorms suck hella balls, but if you can live in circles, gardens, or off campus that isn\u2019t bad, the bus system is kinda wack, and there\u2019s a lot of walking involved with being on campus (get those \u201cIthacalves\u201d).\n\nSorry I just wrote a lot, but overall I love it and wouldn\u2019t have chosen any other school for myself, but some things about the school will piss you off, but that\u2019s the case with anywhere.",

Besides the shitty weather and price tag, there isn't much to hate, and they're giving me a good enough deal. I'll just have to buy a decent winter jacket and I'm good.",

There's always lots of things going on whether it's events by the college or parties or w/e there's always something to do.\n\nIf you haven't visited I highly suggest it. I've never been to Oswego.",

It's rather easy to make friends here, just be yourself.\nEducation \u2013 The business school just got a nice upgrade so you defiantly got it set up for you if you stick with business. Park is also really awesome, and I think as the years go on these two schools are getting more integrated with eachother too. \n\nI don't know much of anything about SUNY Oswego, sorry.",

By the time you graduate you probably won\u2019t have to worry about the ICC and fulfilling its requirements.\n\nBasically, just pick the theme you think sounds the most interesting. I know Identities offers a ton more course options, but I did Mind, Body, Spirit and really enjoyed the classes I ended up taking. Every semester the office of Registrar posts a schematic that breaks down what courses fall under what theme, or you can search through Homerconnect and see what courses fit your theme. \n\nThe ICC is a very small part of your college experience that you shouldn\u2019t worry about it too much.",

Keep researching, visiting schools, negotiating price, talk to students, teachers etc.  it\u2019s a big decision.  The school is in a restructuring phase like many liberal arts colleges rn. Schools that don\u2019t change with the times may not survive.  Do I agree with every decision they\u2019ve made: no.  But I read about other colleges and this is not unique to IC.  Great community and location.",

I've found it to be a very vibrant, innovative, and nurturing community, even in the middle of the pandemic. You can DM me and I'll put you in touch with one of the screenwriting faculty if you haven't been in touch with any as yet.\n\nNo matter what someone's opinion of the administration may be, it's more important that the return on investment of time and money makes the experience worth it. And I would definitely say it does at Park.",

I had glossy internships that would have been impossible to get otherwise. Prestige schools such as Park will get you a good ROI so long as you give 100% effort and network your way into the industry. If you can do the ICLA program, like I did, it will help tremendously.",

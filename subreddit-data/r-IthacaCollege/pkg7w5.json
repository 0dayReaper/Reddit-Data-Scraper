    "postText": "Does anyone else constantly experience dropped calls on campus? It's been an issue since my freshman year. My signal up here is always poor\u2014I thought it was an issue with my carrier (Verizon) but I've asked other people with Verizon and they have no issues. I've also contacted Verizon directly, which got me nowhere. Would love to hear what sort of experiences you all are having/if there are any solutions.",

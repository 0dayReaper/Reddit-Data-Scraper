I would have had to take like 20 extra credits for it. I ended up with a Sport Studies minor because all the classes required for the minor, I already took/was going to take.\n\nDefinitely would recommend talking to your advisors when you start. They\u2019ll have a better idea of course load would be like for your major.\n\nHope this helps! Congrats as well! :)",

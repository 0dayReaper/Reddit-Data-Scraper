Housing is not cheap either, even a studio or 1b/1ba apartment will run you a bit under 2k/mo in some locations. Truthfully, if I could redo it I would have picked USF over FAU. The amount of commuters at FAU ruins the whole \u201ccollege campus\u201d ambiance for me.",

Well, unless you somehow have the funds, but I think going to a less expensive school would be better. FAU is a commuter school and if you search this group you'll find a lot of people have difficulty finding friends.",

Psych is their 2nd (?) most common major there and they have study abroad psych programs to some neat places. Other than that tho, If you\u2019re coming from out of state you may need to consider funds more since FAU Honors Housing is good, but pretty expensive.",

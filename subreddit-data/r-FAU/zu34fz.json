AKA, me refreshing my email constantly awaiting a decision these past few weeks. In the past has the admissions team made decisions during this holiday season? Starting to get anxious about not hearing back",

She applied on Nov 1st and got her decision on Friday for Summer term. They were working and replying to emails a day or so ago so if you are not missing anything in the portal try emailing admissions for a status and they can respond when they are off of break.",

Depending on the major you applied to if you did, they could take a certain period of time to return your admission. I understand the stress because i have been there. Best of luck, i know your future will be great, good luck!",

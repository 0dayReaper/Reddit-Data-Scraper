    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI go accepted over a week ago for a masters in fall 2023 but I still did not recieve my acceptance letter. How long should I expect to wait for me to recieve it and how quickly are I-20's sent after all financial documents are submitted? Thank you.",

Also, contact the international student office regarding I-20s. IDK how some randos on reddit would know this? Also, I'm not sure if they send out actual acceptance letters anymore. Rather, u should be emailed one or gotten one in the application portal. Congrats on the acceptance BTW",

Therefore, I have to activate my account and to do that I need the acceptance letter to be sent to my email which would contain my FAUID. Only then I submit my I-20 documents.",

    "postText": "Hey guys. I'm planning on moving to Boca, transferring from another school. What's the best/cheapest options for housing? I don't really want to live on campus and I'm trying to find something cheaper than university park. I know on campus would be cheaper, but I'm doing pilot training and it wouldn't necessarily be through the school. Any tips?",

It's got 7 months left on the lease with the option of renewal. It's actually 'cheap' considering 2BR now in the same building are going for $3400 - $3500. If you get a roommate it's not bad and it comes with parking.",

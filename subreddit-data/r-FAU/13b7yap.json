            "comment": "okay, i\u2019m a student. had a macbook, I personally like them more bc it\u2019s super easy uploading documents and stuff and airdropping stuff to my computer. well after four years my macbook randomly cracked\u2026 so i needed to buy a new one. BUT, I didn\u2019t buy it from Apple. (i\u2019m poor af)\ud83d\ude02 I got it from backmarket, it\u2019s refurbished computers, phones, etc, and it\u2019s great. My computer from there is a 2017 Macbook Air and I have no problems with it. I got it for 300, which is great because that\u2019s the max I could afford, you also get a student discount and they can use their edu email. it\u2019s honestly up to preference but make sure it has lots of storage! I hope this helps:)",

It was kind of a headache because then id have to go to lecture see what everyone else learned and the. Go back on my own time and have to teach myself the exact same thing but using a Mac. \n\nPCs are more common and standard, so lest likely to run into an issue like that honestly.",

The syllabus itself said mac or PC because the software works on either but the teacher HATEDDDDD and refused to help anyone that used a Mac (which was me and I wasn\u2019t about to go spend an extra few hundred just so shed help me) \n\nI personally have always used and prefer MacBooks (My background prior to going back to school recently was in art so its industry standard) but if I didn\u2019t have a laptop going in id probably get a high spec PC because they\u2019re just more standard then Mac products are.",

I am a computer science major and took a 3D modeling class for engineers that required us to use software on windows and that\u2019s how I did the entire class. Otherwise I have been 100% fine on a Mac.",

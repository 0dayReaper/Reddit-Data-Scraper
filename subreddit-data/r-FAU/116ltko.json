            "comment": "Staff seems generally friendly and accepting of LGBTQ+ students. When I met with CAPS they were fairly accepting also. The Board of Trustees though, as another commenter said, are fairly anti-LGBTQ+.\n\nI know SG might have a few LGBTQ+ representatives and they\u2019re doing some pretty good work for the community lately. Just maybe avoid the frat bros though, they toss around the word \u201cgay,\u201d like an insult from what I\u2019ve observed. In general though you shouldn\u2019t have an issue with most students.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to note is that while FAU may be somewhat LGBTQ+ friendly, Florida and the Governor in general is not. DeSantis is doing his best (or worst) to terrorize LGBTQ+ people - requesting records on trans students, cutting diversity funding, and more. So if you\u2019re moving from out of state, I\u2019d strongly recommend considering choosing somewhere else if you value your safety as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.",

Some faculty are and some aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a mixed bag depending on which department but generally I\u2019d say friendly. \n\nWhat is important to note is that the Board of Trustees is generally not. Several members have been very vocal about their beliefs against lgbtq+ communities. Also the Florida governor has made it so that state funds can\u2019t go to diversity programs so whatever existing Queer friendly programs FAU has may be cut due to his decision.",

            "comment": "FAU has pride events and even have center of ideas for diversity and inclusion. But even that, with the flags in the office it's only the mainstream identities of Bi, Pan, Ace, Aro, NB, Gender fluid &amp; Agender. Identities like Demigenders, Demisexual, Grey Ace, or any of the other labels isn't widely known and talked about besides if you lucky students. I meet more students with using different identities of pronouns, gender identity and sexuality then I expected but I feel like FAU could do better in representation of the Aro/Ace Community since speaking from a person who is Demirose (Demiromantic &amp; Demisexual) and someone who is also Idemromantic, feeling how sexual everyone and the queer community is at times sucks, especially if you take a minute in liking someone yk or just not want relationships/sexual encounters for various reasons.",

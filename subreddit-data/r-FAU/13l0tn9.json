Other than that I don't think I can be very helpful with finding ways of meeting groups of computer major people. I mean, the only thing I can think of that hasn't been mentioned already is maybe try to look for a FAU club relating to the major and get in contact with whoever is in charge. Even if you are remote you can still get involved.",

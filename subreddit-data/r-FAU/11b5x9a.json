    "postText": "I know Fau gets a bad rap but I wanted to hear genuine responds from people. I\u2019ve been told going to fau is not like you\u2019re going to college in Florida and that it\u2019s more like you\u2019re living in Boca and take classes there. Would you say this is accurate? Do you feel like the students on campus are connected as a school? I know the party scene is mostly clubs and bars but how are the frat parties? Do you feel like going to fau has forced you to grow up quicker then if you went to a traditional state school? \n\nLastly, what made you come here and do you having any regrets for coming?",

            "comment": "Honestly i feel like it\u2019s a normal college experience. FL has huge party schools (FSU, UCF, ect) so it seems underwhelming compared to those but it\u2019s pretty similar to most average colleges. The frat parties are good and the tailgates are better than even UF &amp; UCF tbh. It\u2019s really what you make it. You can have the traditional party college experience with the frats plus have the soflo club experience all in one. I have no regrets going to FAU &amp; you grow up at your own pace. Everyone can have a different experience based on how much you try / put yourself out there",

I had a great experience at FAU, did my undergrad and MBA there and do not regret it. Wish we had more of a frat experience like a state school but the FAU experience feels genuine and Boca is great. Brightline open now in boca too with quick access to Fort Lauderdale, Miami, west palm which I wish I had. That\u2019ll make the experience even better and open up more of south Florida to you",

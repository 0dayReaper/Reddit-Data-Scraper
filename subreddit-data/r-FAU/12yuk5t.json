    "postText": "I\u2019m taking my final 7 credits in the summer. Will I get approved to graduate even if I\u2019m technically still in courses? Academic advisors are useless at this point because I can\u2019t get ahold of them so i\u2019m trying my chances here.\n\nI also applied for my Masters in the Fall but obviously everything is dependent on my completion of my summer courses. \n\nIf anyone has experience with this, please share!",

Thats also when I started receiving emails about graduation and commencement. \n\nThere\u2019s actually a page dedicated to all graduation and commencement info in the FAU website, you can find it by googling FAU Graduation commencement and there\u2019s actually a specific email for all of that stuff.",

            "comment": "When you fail a class and retake it, grade forgiveness removes the failed class from affecting your GPA and replaces it with whatever your second attempt grade was. but the actual \u201cF\u201d letter stays on your transcript.\n\nGrade forgiveness forms are filled out after you have retaken the failed class. \n\nYou get two (I think) grade forgivenesses to use for the entire four years. \n\nIf you google \u201cfau grade forgiveness form\u201d it should come up and you can fill out and submit it, BUT if you are a freshman you need advisor approval or it will get denied. I\u2019d recommend talking to an advisor first either way.",

Or you have no clue \u2014 because like you said you are allowed two attempts and I\u2019ve never used one so I would like to retake the course next year and show the school proof that my situation has changed of course.",

Since you haven\u2019t taken another attempt yet there\u2019s nothing to replace the F with. Still though, it\u2019s worth explaining your situation to an advisor and see what they have to say.",

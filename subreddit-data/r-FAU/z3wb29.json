There are also plenty of events, intramural sports, etc. Greek life will definitely keep you busy. In terms of actual house parties, these are not as common since they require more planning and often get shut down anyways. Brothers usually just go to clubs or bars on the weekends.",

Greek life definitely keeps you busy if you wanna stay busy, but i know some people who also go out that much who aren\u2019t in greek life. i can\u2019t recommend a fake but it could make it easier to get in places. I have a friend who made lifelong friends in greek life, go for it if you\u2019re curious i don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

I  think once upon a time they would host parties mainly at the same house that was off campus but it became too risky and would get shut down sometimes, so nowadays the Brothers just kinda get out and do whatever they want, not many house parties, mainly clubbing",

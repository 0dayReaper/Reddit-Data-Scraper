    "postText": "Ever since Coronavirus has been in effect, \nthere has been a significant decrease in campus trash. Custodians don't know what to do! There ain't no god damn trash. When I, Owlsley, went to throw away my taco bell wrappers at an empty trashcan in the breezeway, a custodian immediately zipped right up to the trash can and changed the bag immediately. I am like, that's kind of a waste of a garbage bag... but the custodian didn't care. He was going out of his mind with the complete and utter lack of work to do. He had a crazed look in his eye. Suddenly craisins sound delicious.\n\nBut now onto what I wish to say to everyone. There's no trash on campus-- think of the implications. For every garbage bag wasted on a single taco bell rapper, a family of raccoons starves for another day. \nFAU houses some of the most important and significant raccoons ever born. One of my best friends, Rocky Raccoon, is going hungry for Coronavirus and it's our job to take the pledge and help out. Please donate your garbage to HungryRaccoons.com and sort by school until you find FAU. Thanks! Save the raccoons!!!!!!",

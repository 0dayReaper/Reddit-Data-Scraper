    "postText": "Owlsley is your daddy owlsley is your daddy owlsey is your daddy, owlsley is you dady, owlsley is your daddy, owlsley is your daddy \n\nCatch me at the starbucks hanging with the star ducks, drinking hella coffee, I love coffee. HOot hotter, feeling so good, looking so clean, got a new feather trim, roll up in my whip mustang like what up I got big burd muscles for tossing footballs. Catch me in the football terrarium and the telescopic observatory catching lots of big moons and planes and things. Catch me as the glue holding the school together , the breezeway construction a Spinal Tap construction production, catch me in the art hallways appreciating artwork, playing piano. Like hot cross buns and stuff Owlsley is your daddy, real hip hop comes from mascot birds. Real birds come from real bird moms and real bird daddies like Owlsley, who is me, who is your daddy, the mascot bird. The daddy from another caddy, you sons and daughters of golfers of palm beach, and you denizens of broward with your krispy kreme locations and your cruise ship dream lands, dunes of trash and laid back lifestyles, the Miami commuters of yesteryear \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHoot is a total ripoff of me, I can't believe they designed hoot to look nearly identical to me, they should have given Hoot purple hair or something. Hootie hoot, Hootie hoot hootie hootie hoot. Catch me at the crib turning up on caffeine doing all my assignments online and having e-meetings with professors, catch me as a costume in a closet somewhere in the student union probably, catch me in my dorm with the lights on chowing down on some offseason eggnog with extra 'meg\n\nWho's your daddy? Owlsley. Owlsley is your daddy.\n\nVirtual hacki sacking with your friends keeps you going, ordering pizza and staying in is incredible, and very fun, I love to eat the shit from the back of the fridge, I love to clean the corners, and I love to have an excess of time, no stress. This era could be a new frontier of creativity, finding magical things to do at home. Brian Eno, inventor of ambient music, once said that to have a job is a major killer of creativity. You cannot pioneer anything with your energy and life force sucked through your eyes. Don't come at things straight, don't sneak up on them, and don't hit them sideways, you must invent a new direction, and that direction is the direction of Owlsley of FAU\n\nOwlsley is your daddy. Now that's what I'm talking about. If you have questions, leave them in the comments",

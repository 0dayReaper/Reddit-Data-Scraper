    "postText": "I applied on 11/18/22 and still haven\u2019t heard back. My status is still \u201cComplete (Pending Review)\u201d. I really, really want to go here and I\u2019m starting to get nervous that the long wait time means I\u2019m going to be rejected. I keep reading of people hearing back within a month, and even the FAU website says 4-6 weeks approximately.\nHow long did it take for you to hear back? Is it unusual for the admissions committee to take this long? Thanks!",

    "postText": "This is my last year. Needless to say its not going well. On the bright side i changed my major to general studies and i have about 10 credits left. My advisor said they can be anything. All to be taken during summer. What classes do you guys recommend? I prefer online as i dont always have access to a car. I believe 10 credits is about 3-4 classes.",

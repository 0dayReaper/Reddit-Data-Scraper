I am curious if this school has a good psych program and if it's worth it for the price? There are a couple other options in South Florida but this is the most local school to me. Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.",

The same bad outcomes are evident in every country. You would get a much better return from a different major. At 35 you don't want to be wasting time.\n\nCheck out this long post which outlines what a bad choice Psychology typically is.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/10j41aj/psychology_is_probably_not_a_good_choice_of/",

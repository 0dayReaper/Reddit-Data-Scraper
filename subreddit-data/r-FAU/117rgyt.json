You have the choice to pick your schedule, your class times, and your professors. Here\u2019s an example of my schedule:\n\nMonday: Class from 11:00-11:50. Another class from 1:00-1:50\nTuesday: Class from 12:30-1:50\nWednesday: Class from 9:30-10:50. Another class from 1:00-1:50\nThursday: Class from 10:00-11:50. Another class from 12:30-1:50\nFriday: Class from 9:30-10:50. Another class from 1:00-1:50.\n\nDuring my free time I\u2019m either in the food court, dining hall, or in the library. I recommend joining clubs bc that is one of the best ways to meet new people. If you want, you can add me on Snapchat. My Snapchat is @jblakes03",

            "comment": "Like Initial said, instead of having classes in one long 8 hour block such is the case in High School, you\u2019ll generally have them more spread out throughout the week. How many classes you end up taking and when you\u2019ll take them is really up to you - you can have classes on only 2 days a week, or maybe 1 every day of the week. It\u2019s your choice as long as you register early.\n\nThere\u2019s many clubs and organizations on campus that you can take part in to fill your newfound time with. Maybe join the CSC to get some community service done, or SG to have a voice in what gets done on campus, or a fraternity / sorority if that\u2019s your thing (I personally could never do that, but more power to you if you choose to rush). There\u2019s also many part-time jobs that you can take on campus, and the best part is they\u2019ll work around your schedule. I\u2019d recommend working the front desk at one of the housing buildings - it\u2019s a fairly easy job and you get to interact with some cool people.\n\nAnd about housing - I know you said you\u2019re not on campus but if you ever decide to go down that route - housing is extremely limited and in extremely high demand. In the off chance you do get housing, you\u2019ll likely be assigned roommates (or you can pick them if you have someone in mind). For my summer semester I shared a room with 1 and my suite had 4 people (1 shared room and 2 singles). Make sure you reach out to your roommate and coordinate what you want to bring, because common household items are your responsibility now.",

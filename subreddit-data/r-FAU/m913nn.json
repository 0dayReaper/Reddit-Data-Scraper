    "postText": "After attending both universities FAU is better academically and in college experience than UCF (U Can\u2019t Finish). Here are the reasons: Professors have a lot of years of experience teaching and they are always accessible to students. Class sizes at FAU are smaller and learning experience is nicer. It\u2019s easy to make more connections at FAU because the university is smaller and there is more opportunities available. Advisors at FAU are very good and are always available. The location is nicer and is close to the ocean. Go Owls.",

I loved Boca and FAU. \n\nMy buddies who all went to UF, FSU, and UCF mocked me for my decision to attend years ago but my experience there was nothing but incredible. Learned a ton. \n\nI majored in Geography (GIS). Great department and very tight knit. My instructor and eventual advisor helped me get my foot in the door careerwise and I've flourished. South Florida was also the perfect place for studying GIS. Other schools in the state also had great programs but the combination of having the Everglades next door, and competing with immense urban growth, there was so much to study and utilize. \n\nI live way up north now and all my buddies who went to school in the Midwest or the Northeast thinks everything about FAU sounds like a dream! \n\nUCF is a great school, but I'm so proud of how far FAU has come and I love calling myself an alum.",

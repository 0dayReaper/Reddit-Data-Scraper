I'm doing post-grad stuff here and was used to FIU's rec center which is like a sports complex more than a normal sized gym like FAU's\n\nUsually I'd go at 10:p.m-ish but recently it started being a little more crowded and unfortunately Fridays and Weekends I can't go that late because they close earlier",

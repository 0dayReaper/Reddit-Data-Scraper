My last college housing experience was awful and I want to make sure nothing like that happens again. For on campus I\u2019m looking at IVAS and off I\u2019m looking at University Park and Yard University. Thanks!",

I can only think how much better it would\u2019ve been in IVAS.",

I do have another question, I\u2019m going to have to do productions in the summer (musical theatre major) and I would really prefer to be up in Boca for that. I live close enough to commute but far enough to where it\u2019s a lot of money to do so ($150 on gas a week). Would I be able to be on campus if I chose to be on IVAS?",

IVAS is probably you\u2019re best bet! \n\nI live about 45min northwest of Boca, so I understand the struggle to find housing. it was so easy being on campus.",

I would generally stay away from Heritage Park Towers (HPT). they had a lot of problems going on, the whole place should get a long needed update. (There was a fire there last year due to the dryers in the laundry room). though, I think it\u2019s a freshman dorm so it might not even be on your roster. \n\nthat being said, the dorms at FAU aren\u2019t as bad as people typically think and you have pretty solid options! hope this helps :)",

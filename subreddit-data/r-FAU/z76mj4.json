    "postText": "I cheated on a test and the teacher caught me, I feel absolutely horrible about it. Ive gotten the email about the code of academic integrity from my teacher and the head of the department.\nI think theyre asking me to write my case but Im not sure how much to write or what to expect. If anyone has any advise on what to expect at the every least, I\u2019d appreciate it. \nI feel so lost right now, Id just appreciate if someone told it to me straight since the emails don\u2019t make any sense to me.",

            "comment": "1. Address the person conducting your class as a professor or instructor.\n2. Write the personal statement like you\u2019re an educated college student.\n3. Own your bad judgement. Accept responsibility and explain why you made the choice to cheat (you\u2019re overwhelmed, you weren\u2019t confident, etc.)\n4. Accept your punishment (first offense is probably minor but documented)\n\nMy final advice is for you to understand that college is a place where you\u2019ll make mistakes &amp; really bad decisions, however these are your choices and you have to own the good, the bad &amp; the ugly. Taking responsibility may suck but you figuring it all out makes you the person you are. You slipped, now get up and move on.",

IIRC you can take a peer counseling course and if you pass it your dishonesty note will get expunged from the record (but it\u2019ll stay in the internal records).\n\nNext time it happens you\u2019ll get expelled from the university as a whole. Do be careful going forward and make sure you learn from this slip up. Best of luck.",

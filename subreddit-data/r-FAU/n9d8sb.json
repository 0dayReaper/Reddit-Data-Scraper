    "postText": "FAU Announcement\n\n&gt;FAU Students, Faculty and Staff,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Due to changes in guidance by the [State University System of Florida Board of Governors](https://www.flbog.edu/) (SUS), FAU\u2019s health and safety policies regarding **face coverings** have been updated. Effective immediately, wearing of face coverings is now **recommended**, not required, when indoors.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The SUS also announced last week that all universities will return to pre-COVID-19 operations by the 2021-22 academic year. A return to full in-person participation in athletic and social activities on all campuses, including fan participation in stadiums and arenas, is anticipated.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As FAU approaches a return to full operations, all members of the university community are strongly encouraged to ***Protect Your Owl Family*** and get vaccinated against COVID-19. The [federal government](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/participating-pharmacies.html) and the [State of Florida](https://myvaccine.fl.gov/#/) have vaccine distribution centers available throughout FAU\u2019s service areas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Following guidance from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html), as outlined in the [FAU Health and Safety Plan](https://www.fau.edu/coronavirus/documents/fau-covid-19-has-plan.pdf), will help limit COVID-19 on our campuses, as well as in our local communities. As such, FAU will continue other health and safety measures, such as increased cleaning conducted by campus custodial, twice weekly wellness attestations for all employees, and contact tracing and COVID-19 testing conducted by Student Health Services.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Until further notice, maximum attendance for all events remains at 100 people or 25% of venue capacity (whichever is lower). Detailed guidance on events is available in the FAU [Events and Gatherings](https://www.fau.edu/coronavirus/documents/fau-covid-spring-21-event-gathering-guide.pdf) document.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Stay home if you are sick or experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Students and employees need to continue reporting to [Student Health Services](https://www.fau.edu/shs/) (561-297-3512, select option 3) if experiencing COVID-19 or flu symptoms, are exposed to COVID-19 (even if out of the area) or test positive for COVID-19.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;General questions related to the COVID-19 situation should be directed to [FAUCOVID19@fau.edu](mailto:FAUCOVID19@fau.edu). All feedback is shared with applicable departments across FAU campuses to ensure adjustments as necessary. Visit the [FAU coronavirus website](http://www.fau.edu/coronavirus/) for additional information.",

There also is some evidence that vaccination may make illness less severe in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. Despite this, some fully vaccinated people will still be hospitalized and die. However, the overall risk of hospitalization and death among fully vaccinated people will be much lower than among people with similar risk factors who are not vaccinated.",

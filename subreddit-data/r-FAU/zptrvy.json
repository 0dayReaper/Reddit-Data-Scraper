But when I go to email the college of engineering, they said only late withdrawal from all courses is allowed. I spoke to my advisor again to see what the discrepancy was, and he says he still strongly believes you are allowed to withdrawal from one course? Anyone know the answer ?",

There is a deadline every semester to withdraw and it is before the end of the term. The dates are posted on the academic calendar online.",

    "postText": "I'm doing my taxes for 2022 and it's asking what the total cost of books and materials was, I looked on myFAU student services for costs but I can't find the price for the books. There are some fees such as eLearning Fee and Equipment Fees but I'm not sure if they count as material fees or not. Any help or guidance would be appreciated.",

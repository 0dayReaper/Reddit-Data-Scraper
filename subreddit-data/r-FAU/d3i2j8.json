    "postText": "I am really really tired of reserving a study room only to be surrounded by other students socializing in theirs. The walls aren't that thick, and it makes it impossible to concentrate. Yeah yeah, I can put on headphones. But is silence/quiet really too much to ask for in a library? \n\nSometimes I get a study room and the entire thing looks like the aftermath of a Pornhub flick starring Chick Fix A's Polynesian sauce. Your Mom does not live here, be a f**king adult and clean up your sauce.\n\nWhile I'm at it another pet peeve that really gets me heated is people sitting/eating on staircases. In a vacuum or down time this isn't an issue. But during class change or high traffic - stop thinking only about yourself and get the f**k off the stairs!\n\nWe can all do better, and be more considerate of others.\n\nGood night.",

This particular class we need a room because it's three of us and campus is the best solution for now.\n\nI really like the encouraging messages to believe in yourself that I find scrawled on the cubicles in West 3!",

If wherever you end up is not for you, that's okay. Try somewhere else. \nI enjoy FAU. It's nice being near the water, all kinds of people go here, and it's laid back. I just wish there was more Caribbean food in the dining hall.",

It becomes \"annoying\" when you are subject to a +/- grading system and competing with another student who is not. \nFor example, you can both get an 80. But their \"B\" is worth more than your \"B-\" due to the application of a +/- grading system.  \nSo, presumably, if both of you have identical scores but one is subjected to a +/- and the other is not...those who are not subjected to it may appear more academically competitive on paper. It is what it is, just study hard and get those A's and you'll be good.",

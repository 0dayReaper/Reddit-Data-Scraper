However I was in a small program with classes that rarely filled. \n\nYou\u2019ll still have options if you register now so id suggest making your Fall schedule asap but don\u2019t stress if you don\u2019t get all of the classes your looking to get, check back during add drop (frequently) and you can usually find a spot eventually.",

If you do its really not that bad from my experience. Tuition waivers also get an extension on when final balance is due. Feel free to DM I\u2019ve been using one for 2 years now for undergrad and now again during my masters.",

Theres not real deadline I submitted my waiver last minute Friday the day summer session opened \ud83d\ude02 they replied back same day to say it was received. \n\nIt\u2019s basically like riding stand by. They wait till classes are about to start and then anything empty would have been empty and they would get zero dollars for those empty seat, so with the waiver those would be empty seats get filled by state employees and they get paid by the state instead of getting nothing by letting those seat run empty. \n\nFAU will put a hold on your account that will not lift till the day before and if you register before you submit your paperwork for processing they give you 48 to unregister before they reject the waiver. It honestly sounds a lot more annoying then it is.",

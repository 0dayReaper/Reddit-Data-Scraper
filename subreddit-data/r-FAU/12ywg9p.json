    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m moving from NJ for graduate college at FAU. Seen some pretty good reviews about the school and southern Florida seems a much better place to live than NJ. But just wanted to see how people at the school like the area and where the best spots to meet new people are. I\u2019ll have a car so I can definitely travel to Ft.Lauderdale or Delray just want to get a sense of what life there is like before I move. Any help will be appreciated thanks.",

I smoke weed so I just enjoy the nice weather, food, the nature. it depends who you are as a person and what you make out of it. at first I didn\u2019t like it, I felt so alone but once I got my job and found my people, I fell in love with it.",

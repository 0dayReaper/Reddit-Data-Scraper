    "postText": "So, I finished my first semester at FAU and I don't know anyone. I don't live near the Boca Campus at all, 50 minute's drive for me. I am set to only have class at the Boca campus twice a week. I live closer to the Davie campus, but it is lifeless. Any advice on how to meet new people who go here? Should I give up on meeting people if I'm not dorming?",

    "postText": "I signed up for orgo 2 with Dr. West for the full summer semester and I am hearing very mixed things. I am not an FAU student so I am not sure what to totally expect from him but I heard a lot of people failed the class. Anything I should know going into it? Any tips to succeed. Will continue studying for the MCAT at the same time.",

You can also go to SI in-person, but it's with someone else since Rosemarry graduated. \n\nI took the exams online which made things a lot easier. As long as you know what you're  doing and study, they aren't awful.",

    "postText": "I am from the Midwest and my family is looking to move to Florida when I graduate high school in the spring, and I was just accepted to FAU. I\u2019ve looked at so many schools in Florida, and the first one that caught my eye was FAU. I could definitely see myself at FAU and loving it when I went on my first tour there. I hadn\u2019t read much about it but just booked a tour because it looked nice. After my tour I looked online and I read so many reviews of how many people hated it. I literally read someone\u2019s review who said they would rather go to a community college and they haven\u2019t learned anything. Obviously beyond a school with a good social life and all that I do want a good education. I know there\u2019s people who hate their school and that\u2019s normal, but the amount of people I\u2019ve read who didn\u2019t like it was very overwhelming to me. I\u2019m going again next week to tour FAU again now that I\u2019m accepted and I\u2019m so uncertain about how I feel about this school because it was my favorite school until I read all the negative comments about it. If you are a student at FAU, please leave me some of your thoughts and opinions on this school. Thank you",

            "comment": "IMO asking reddit is gonna be very biased\u2026.\n\nMost people\u2019s main drawbacks:\n- FAU is a commuter school so it does not have that extreme \u201ccollege town\u201d vibe where everything in town is based around the college. If you\u2019re looking for that big, historic, \u201ccollege\u201d experience, yeah it probably isn\u2019t here.\n- So, so many students sit in their dorm room, never go up and talk to anyone on campus, never make friends, and then say they hate it here.\n- The campus itself is not always buzzing with life. There are some days where a lot is going on and some days where the campus seems like a ghost town.\n\nHowever I love it here. You only get out of this school what you put in. You have to put yourself out there and go meet people to have fun. Nobody is going to do it for you. I met my best friends here and I have a ton of fun.\n\nPersonally I recommend joining greek life if you\u2019re going to go here as it is a great opportunity to make friends / meet people, as well as participate in all kinds of fun events throughout the years that greek life has to offer. The same applies for joining one of the many clubs on campus if greek life isn\u2019t your thing (however, a lot of the stereotypes and social media make greek life out to be terrible, i suggest simply giving it a try and if you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t join).\n\nAs far as the party scene goes:\n\n- The local bars of boca are in mizner park, the \u201cdowntown\u201d area. Main two are O\u2019Brian\u2019s and the standard. They make for a fun casual night out and a great way to meet a lot of fellow students. However they are not \u201clast night was such a movie\u201d places.\n\n- Outside of that you have Atlantic Ave in Delray Beach. Personally my favorite place to go, it is much more lively than Boca and is still a go-to for fellow college kids, but there are plenty actual adults there aswell. \n\n- You also have Ft. lauderdale for the club scene, it\u2019s fun once in a while but personally I prefer to stick to more local bars most of the time.\n\n- Most house parties are thrown by fraternities, so if you\u2019re a guy you would most likely need to be in one to go to them. If you\u2019re a girl you can go to whatever parties you want (sounds bad but that\u2019s pretty much every college anywhere)\n\n- Tailgates (football, basketball) are in my opinion the most fun part of going to FAU. They are awesome. Same thing as house parties applies though as far as getting in. If you\u2019re a guy sometimes you can pay to get in (fraternity members also pay $30-$50 EACH per tailgate / party, so you are not being singled out for not being involved. these things just cost money.)\n\nNow for the education:\n\n- It is not the best and it\u2019s not the worst. I\u2019ve had amazing professors and I\u2019ve had terrible ones. It really boils down to checking ratemyprofessor before entering a class.\n- Academic advising is also dependent upon the advisor. Some are TERRIBLE and some are really awesome.\n- I would say learning here is average at best, but once again, you have to TRY to learn. Nobody is going to learn stuff for you. If you\u2019re on your phone or skipping class half the time, you will not learn anything. \n- I would highly recommend taking in person classes and not online ones. I retain much more and meet people.\n\n\nFurthermore, you also live right by the beach, which is something that FSU, UF, UCF do not offer. (what is the point of living in florida if you aren\u2019t by the beach lol)\n\nAll in all, i have had an awesome experience here. I\u2019ve met lifelong friends and never find myself bored, there is always something to do. Like I said before, you get out what you put in. \n\nHope that helps you!",

[Here](https://fau.campuslabs.com/engage/Organizations) is a list of all 451 clubs and orgs at FAU. If any interest you, joining one will basically automatically open up opportunities to meet people and make friends. Personally I\u2019m into fitness so i\u2019ve made plenty friends just by going to the campus gym. \n\nOutside of that, meeting people in class is the obvious easiest way. I think the covid era made a lot of people get accustomed to not being social, hence a lot of the current freshman / sophomores never really put themselves out there. \n\nAlso, like anywhere, there *are* rude / mean people here, and you\u2019re bound to encounter them. Just ignore it.",

Difficult for most, but the classes are around the same level as you\u2019d expect for a Florida public school. Personally I\u2019ve had good experiences, and the teachers are helpful if you don\u2019t get on their bad side. \n\nAcademic Opportunities \n\n- also very good. Tons of people who\u2019d help you out in figuring out what/where you wanna work in. Next to 3 big research institutes, but their all STEM focused. Most of the people at Jupiter are pre med + a science so it works out for us\n\nClubs\n\n- clubs are okay but held back because of resources, but I assume it\u2019s better in Boca because of their much larger student union\n\nSocial life \n\n- people are okay, no one is gonna start drama unless you fall into those cliques. In general the population is definitely more shy or doesn\u2019t leave the dorm often, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t befriend or socialize. Will say tho on campus hangouts are not great\u2026 having a car actually gives us good hangouts\n\nPersonally I rate the school 4/5. I\u2019m from FL and really didn\u2019t wanna pay out of state tuition on other schools. I was between FAU WHC and UF, and although I do think UF is generally better overall, the specifics of my education/preferences were better in the WHC, and coming here I realize that it wasn\u2019t that bad after all. I imagine a lot of this applies to Boca too, since the only real difference is institutes and courses (both of which you can commute to take from Boca)",

I never understood why people flew in from different states just to go here.  Of course everyone\u2019s experience will be different and college is what you make of it yada yada.  But most of the people I met only go here because it was relatively inexpensive and close to home.  If you like the beach there\u2019s that, and if you enjoy the nightlife we are about an hour from Miami.  And the gym on campus is decent (free for students) and comes with free group fitness classes.  I\u2019m personally a big fan of the yoga and cycle classes. The professors are mostly nice as well, although class sizes are mostly pretty big so it can be hard to get ahold of them (depending on what class that is).  But other than that, I would say it doesn\u2019t necessarily stand out from other Florida schools.  The campus isn\u2019t that beautiful or historic and if you\u2019re looking for a fun party school this isn\u2019t the right place.  The tailgates are mid in my honest opinion.  But I suppose it isn\u2019t all bad.  Hope this honest answer helps.",

    "postText": "Before spring break I took an exam for MAC 1147 through the respondus software and followed everything according to guidelines. However, on Sunday afternoon I received an email from my instructor stating that there was no video accompanied with my exam. \n\nI\u2019m failing to understand how this is possible considering my webcam light turned on and the software acknowledged that my camera was recording. I already responded to her email but she wasn\u2019t that helpful. \n\nHow is it possible that there\u2019s no video when the only way to complete an exam is through doing the setup process? I also got flagged during the exam for my face being out of frame, but that was when we\u2019re required to show us taking a photo of the written work for submission (emailed her abt that too). I just genuinely don\u2019t understand how this could happen",

I don't drive to school, and take the bus/train. Now, I'm scared to do that without someone waiting with me at the bus stop, at the very least. I guess I'll camp out in the cube over-night on those days. ",

Like, pretty much all of my classes are in that building...\n\nHere's the description from the email:\n\n\"The alleged suspect is described as a black male, around 20 to 25 years of age.  He is approximately 6-feet-tall, has a medium build, dark skin, and was dressed in black shorts and no shirt, with a black bandana.\"\n\nNot to be racist, but that describes like pretty much every black guy on campus.",

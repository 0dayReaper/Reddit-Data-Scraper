Please stay safe and talk to someone or call a local hotline if you need to \u2764\ufe0f. \n\nI just found out about a situation on campus where someone took their life yesterday morning. So I wanted to check in and make sure y\u2019all are doing ok. Or to give you a reminder to ask for help. \n\nIt may be hard to ask for help, but please do so. Whether it\u2019s little things like feelings overworked and overwhelmed to depression, please reach out to those who love you and/or a licensed professional",

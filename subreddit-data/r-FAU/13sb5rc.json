                            "comment": "I have during their winter session, I think the Biochem professor was the best. \n\nBefore I signed up for the class I was trying to self study with Kaplan books, which I thought was too verbose, and hated it. Then I  started the MCAT test prep with FAU and they used TPR which was less wordy so I thought it was great, then I realized personally it wasn't. Most of my BCMP classes were online during covid so it was struggle city.\n\nI don't think the professors go over enough material or how to tackle the question style of the MCAT with the exception of the Biochem professor. The CARS professor was mid but very opinionated on what she thinks the idea criteria for an applicant is which I thought was annoying.\n\nIf I could restart my studying I would stick the the Kaplan books you don't have to buy the newest edition but I would recommend one of the more recent ones. Sign up for FAP with aamc you'll get their test prep for free if you're poor like me. Get Upoop for sure it's helped me understand concepts ALOT, and get anki  miledown deck it correlates with the chapters in the Kaplan books. Additionally aamc has a PDF you can download with what they might test you on I would most definitely download that and go through what I know v.s. what I need to work on or didn't learn.\n\nI haven't tested yet, but I took a practice test before the start of the prep course and scored 489 through TPR and then after I took a practice test but through aamc and score the same. I felt like the course didn't scratch the surface of the material that was covered on the aamc practice test.\n\nBut honestly it could be just me, I graduated in 2021 and decided to chill for a year and didn't study.\n\nBut definitely start with a practice test to gauge the question style and the stamina it takes, I thought a 7 hour test would be okay to sit through but it really taxes your mental ability",

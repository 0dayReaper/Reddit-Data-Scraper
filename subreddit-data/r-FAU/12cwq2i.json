            "comment": "sofla in general is expensive, the South Palm beach / North broward area is very pricey. Apparently some people have luck in Deerfield and Coconut creek but still be prepared to pay min $1700-1800 to live alone. Like people have said a roommate is the easiest way to get cheaper rent and it will still be a min of $1000+ after rent/utilities/bills. \n\nSofla is just very expensive in general and its a cruel joke because the average salary DOES NOT cover the basics needed to live here.\n\nOh also since you said you\u2019re from up north. We have close to zero Transportation options so you will definitely need a car to get around. Which is  sad im saying that because I literally work in Transportation and our public transit SUCKS.",

Rent here is fucking expensive, I have seen studio apartments going for $2000+ a month. Honestly, if you have the means and are willing to commit, looking to get a mortgage would probably be cheaper.",

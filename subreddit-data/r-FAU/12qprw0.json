    "postText": "Hello, I'm professor Eric Isaac, I'm with the FIU religious studies department. Normally people like my classes. I'm writing here to offer an opportunity to meet core class requirements and/or take a really fun trip this summer and get UCC college credit.\n\nThis Summer, there is a great opportunity for you to:\n\n1.\\*Go to Scotland\\*\u00a0with me and other students.\n\n2. Get credit for it\n\n3.\\*\\*Even if you graduated you can go\\*\\*. (Just register as non-degree seeking).\n\n4.\\*\\*Your friends from other Universities can enroll and go too!\\*\\*\n\n\\\\-\n\nThis Summer, I am offering the opportunity to study abroad in Scotland for 1 week following the Summer semester. (Summer ends July 27, we are in Scotland from July 28-Aug 5).\n\nAll FL students need 9 credits of summer classes to graduate, and this is the most efficient and probably coolest way to accomplish that goal. Also, it's the fastest, coolest, and most efficient way to get through annoying and required UCC/Gordon Rule classes.\n\n\\*\\*APPLY, NOW! AND FAST! SPACE IS LIMITED.\\*\\*\n\nFirst, fill out this application:\n\n\\[\\*\\*[https://abroad.fiu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&amp;id=10308\\*\\*](https://abroad.fiu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&amp;id=10308**)\\]([https://abroad.fiu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&amp;id=10308](https://abroad.fiu.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&amp;id=10308))\n\nThen apply for Florida shines (allows you to get financial aid at other FL universities colleges)\n\n[https://www.floridashines.org/succeed-in-college/take-a-course-at-another-school](https://www.floridashines.org/succeed-in-college/take-a-course-at-another-school)\n\nYou pay state tuition, (even if you've graduated or are an international student!) and get credit for one of the following classes. (Choose one)\n\n1. REL 3530 Protestantism, (upper division course)\n2. REL 2011 Intro to religion (a humanities group 2 UCC, Gordon Rule, Global Learning),\n3. REL 3308,\n\n(a Gordon rule course, a global learning, upper division course, and a Social Science group 2 UCC).\n\nNormally these classes would take 16 weeks, but we get it done in the Summer over 6 weeks, and yes you can zoom in. We are meeting for summer B, but we will be in Scotland July 28-August 5.\n\nWe will be going to 4 cities, seeing multiple castles, have access to things regular tourists can never see, and also, we will visit a national park. This trip would normally be double to triple the price if you booked it on your own, but since we get the Group/FIU/University discount, you all are able to get this great deal.\u00a0\n\nTLDR: You save a lot of money going with us, to a\u00a0\\*\\*probably\\*\\*\u200b once in a lifetime place, at the best time of year to go.\n\nA cool feature about this trip is that you book your own flight. Therefore, if you are in another country, you can meet us there. Also, if you'd like, (and I would suggest this), you do have 2.5 weeks after August 5th before classes start, so you can plan to stay a bit longer if you want to.\n\nI have 3 spots left, and I'd love for you to participate. If you want to be a part of it, you must apply through the link above, not through Panthersoft. If you have questions email me at [Eisaac@fiu.edu](mailto:Eisaac@fiu.edu)\n\nEric",

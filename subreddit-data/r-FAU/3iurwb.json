I cut the bottom part off with my new decal number and expiration date and placed it over the old one, essentially cutting the guy out. Today i get back to my car and I had a $100 parking ticket for defacing the decal. This is such bulls**t! There is nothing about defacing decals on the list of do's and don'ts on FAU's parking page not to mention it is not listed in the rules on the back of the parking sticker.  You would think they could at least not hide it in the fine print. I don't think it's appropriate to force someone to put some random person on their car. I don't care if it's a super model, it's just ridiculous.  Bring back the old decal with the FAU OWL logo. ",

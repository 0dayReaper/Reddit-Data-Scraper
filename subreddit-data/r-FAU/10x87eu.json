Transfer students are pretty much the lowest priority when it comes to housing, and this year was like highest amount of students requesting housing in the school\u2019s history. All I\u2019ll say is, definitely have a backup plan. Look for apartments within 5 miles from campus if you have a car but if you don\u2019t then ask the housing admins about possible hotels you could stay at if your financial aid would cover it, they\u2019ve made exceptions like that before",

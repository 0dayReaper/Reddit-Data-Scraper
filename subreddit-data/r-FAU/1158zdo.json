    "postText": "I'm not 18 yet, but I was accepted to the FAU High program where I would take all classes on the uni campus for college credit, and since I was going to spend so much time on there, I was wondering if I could get a membership to the recreation center to go to the gym and work out there despite the age limit (i.e. how strict are they on checking photo ID).\n\nObviously there's other stuff to do, but I was curious and have experience with gym equipment from varsity training that makes it a little more safe. Since I might have a BS by 12th, I might not ever be around to get to it.\n\n(EDIT: Just to be clear, talking about the Boca campus)\n\nThanks!",

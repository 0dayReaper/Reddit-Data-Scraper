They are very smart and all really good friends with one another. It\u2019s also a good chance of getting a job after school. \n\nBoth are math heavy, but we don\u2019t do calculus 1&amp;2 in the BA. Just methods of calculus and statistics. \nIn data science, there\u2019s matrix math, and mean/median/co-sign symmetry but it not anything you can\u2019t fact check with your program. \n\nPros: the stuff you learn will be relevant to programming job that you get into. Coding, big o notation, data structures and algorithms. There are great teachers (Taebi) in the department that know how to teach and the bad ones know their bad/curves grades which will help you eventually pass. \n\nEverything you learn straight from the beginning are the building blocks to the more complex classes. You work on small projects like intro to computing which can be on your resume as examples of html/css. \n\nStudents are friendly, all engaging, there\u2019s a active discord of 300 students that help each other study/ share notes/ talk about gaming. People do come in person to study and classes (even though it can be better in person, like w/ Taebi) a lot of them are recorded/ online so it\u2019s flexible with your schedule. \n\nCons:\nThere are teachers like Bagby and Cardei that are absolutely terrible. Monotone, and gives homework that is difficult to look up because it\u2019s outdated teachings or just really tricky wording. I skipped out on babgy for intro to python and went with Ali, which I completely self taught myself that class. (Luckily a lot of free resources from Harvard will help you) and as much as we (literally majority of students complained about cardei in Intro to computing) despised the dude. The amount of studying I did for his class has helped me understand some of the more advance concepts/alorhithms  I\u2019ve been learning in data structures.\n\nThe biggest con is that you will end up teaching  yourself everything, and it\u2019s on  you to practice. Chat GPT is not completely accurate sometimes. So be careful",

Theres a lot of scholarships that schools and exterior sources give + the pell grant. That estimation of living is more based on housing/food/etc and its technically something that is high wherever you go. In boca, roommating is like 800-1000 while it might be 1500-2500 to do it on your own.   \n\n\nSo overall it will be stressful when transitioning. UCF, FSU, has really great job placement programs/ internships (which negate those costs because they are around 60,000) I'm eventually going to need to temporarily relocate for a internship since I don't see a lot in boca (but i could be wrong because I have been focusing elsewhere)   \n\n\nThe classes are much easier than FSU, UF, UCF, but those are great universities to go to for success in computer science. There is a lot of money coming into the C.S department in FAU so hopefully it helps get more professors. Other than that, they have a lot of good labs here for a B.S in Computer Science.   \nTheres a lot of indians here too lol. So you can make friends easily.  \n\n\nHarvard Lectures:\n\n[https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?utm\\_source=google&amp;utm\\_campaign=19322989673&amp;utm\\_medium=cpc&amp;utm\\_term=harvard%20cs50%20course&amp;hsa\\_acc=7245054034&amp;hsa\\_cam=19322989673&amp;hsa\\_grp=146273875364&amp;hsa\\_ad=642047721504&amp;hsa\\_src=g&amp;hsa\\_tgt=kwd-334019831266&amp;hsa\\_kw=harvard%20cs50%20course&amp;hsa\\_mt=e&amp;hsa\\_net=adwords&amp;hsa\\_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw2cWgBhDYARIsALggUhoKQjkVfn5RfbHhRcZvG1DIsANkEW0CXX\\_ait6aMPqZrxX6dzP3fSwaAugiEALw\\_wcB](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x?utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=19322989673&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=harvard%20cs50%20course&amp;hsa_acc=7245054034&amp;hsa_cam=19322989673&amp;hsa_grp=146273875364&amp;hsa_ad=642047721504&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-334019831266&amp;hsa_kw=harvard%20cs50%20course&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw2cWgBhDYARIsALggUhoKQjkVfn5RfbHhRcZvG1DIsANkEW0CXX_ait6aMPqZrxX6dzP3fSwaAugiEALw_wcB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMIT Courseware(known for being the best in tech)\n\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=data+science",

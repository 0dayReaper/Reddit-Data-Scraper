    "postText": "More or less what the title said. Recently, I got admitted into the BS/MD Program for FAU. However, FAU requires the admitted students for the BS/MD Program to reply back on whether we accept our positions in the program by March 20th, which is only four days away. The problem is that I am not sure if accepting our position in the FAU BS/MD Program binds us to attending FAU, or if we can still choose to attend another university and leave FAU as a backup.\n\nI tried contacting the university, but I'm getting no response. Tried reaching out to the other applicants: one said it is binding; the other said it might not be. Tried contacting current BS/MD students on LinkedIn, but did not get any connections back. So, now I'm stuck, and I'm hoping to consult Reddit to see if I might get some answers. If anyone can share their past experiences with accepting the BS/MD position, that would be great!",

In you case if the program you\u2019re attending requires you to sign a contract or something like that of the sort that can be binding but if there is such a thing it should explicitly list the fees you will incur by cancelling.\n\nHope this helps",

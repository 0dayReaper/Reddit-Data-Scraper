    "postText": "Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet. This is the owl to beat all owls. I am the King Owl. Know what kind of owl I am? I'm a burrowing owl!!!... I think.  Those are the kinds of owls from the book \"HOOT\"!! Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I am owlsley I am owlsley I am owlsley the owl of FAU yes yes yes LAne Kiffin is my daddy daddy daddy, president Kelly is my grandpappy, me love my grandpappy .... yes yes yeYES YES YES YES Good luck on your finals, yes yes yes, good luck! Yes, YES! YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES !! I feel summer creeping in, and I can't stand to see everything ending..... Students graduating,, students leaving for the summer, final exams, TRULY FINAL EXAMS, love is an arrow shot through the heart of this poor bird. Underneath my feathers is a lonely sad grey skinny bird, quite ugly in fact. Everyone is ugly on the inside, everyone looks like a disgusting red fruit thing on the inside, a soft bag of organs. How bizarre. I've met Carrot Top. Carrot Top made the largest mark on culture that anyone has ever made at FAU. How does that make you feel? Carrot Top is the best alum? You serious? It just goes to show how small-scale everything around you is. FAU isn't all that significant in the grand scheme, it's just one strange and sunny school, thankfully located in Beautiful Boca Raton. But I know that I'm not going to leave a mark when I'm rocketed into the true world whatever that may be. I'm but a normal owl, forgotten to time, forgotten. A dream lived briefly but a beautiful dream nonetheless.  FAU vs Ohio State, FAU FAU FAU, love is an arrow shot through the heart of this grey big-eyed bird. And the golfcarts will be running around this teensy patch of ground until the strongest solar flares burn through the trees and buildings leaving ash and rubble, and the people will grow up, and the children will grow up, and the babies will grow up and it will have been very strange in retrospect, after our forms have been stripped of us and we become energy once more, returning to the blue glowing pool of souls somewhere other-universally outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does this owl think of ? What does this owl dream of? Who am I, owlsley the owl? I know there's an answer.\n\nOh yeah, I know the answer. The very Buff Owl. that's what life is about. Getting SWOLE. Or should I say getting SOWLE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYEEAH baby",

If you can't mentally hold on until CAPS opens at 8am, there's a hotline you can call at 561-297-3540. They'll help you survive until you can get over to CAPS. \n\nEven if you're not overwhelmed by finals, CAPS can help you come to terms with transitioning from college owl to graduated owl or anything else that may be plaguing your thoughts.",

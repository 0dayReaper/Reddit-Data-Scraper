Make them show you that! \n\n2) If exchanging money as convenient venmo/cashapp/zelle is, do cash only and make the exchange on campus. If they\u2019re really a student, they have to be on campus sometime between now and Grad. \n\nJust my advice to avoid losing money.\n\nPost scammer user mames below please to save people from them!!",

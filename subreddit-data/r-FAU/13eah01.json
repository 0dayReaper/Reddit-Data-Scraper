    "postText": "My sister, who is done with college, said that her senior year classes were much easier for her. She had less assignments and less brand new concepts. \n\nShe was in a Health major and says that some classes she can barely remember their contents while Chemistry 2 is burned into her brain from the torcher of it.\n\nI was wondering if classes are easier or harder as a senior in a finance major at FAU. Im all online by the way\n\nHere are some of the classes:\n\nBUL 4421 Business Law 1\n\nQMB 3600 Quantitative Methods in Admin\n\nECO 4223 Money and Financial Markets\n\n\nFIN 4424 Advanced Managerial Finance\n\nFIN 4303 Financial Institutions\n\nFIN 4504 Investment Analysis\n\nFIN 4422 Cases of Financial Management\n\n\nElectives:\nFIN 4606 International Finance\n\nFIN 4633 Global Capital Markets\n\n(and can some of the contents of these classes be listed? Prof reqs?)\n\nThank you!",

So your sister is right about that one.\n\nThe 4000-level finance classes are more in-depth than 3000 but not a huge difference. QMB3600 was one of the harder classes, very math-heavy.\n\nThe most important thing is going through spot reviews and rate my professor to pick the best teacher you can.",

            "comment": "Haha Uhm. Tbh most of the difficulty is really gonna depend on which professors you take for these classes. I use rate my professor to choose all of my professors. Most of these classes are pretty straight forward if you pay attention and read and listen to what the professor says about how they manage their class. Now if I had to choose a couple classes that I felt were more difficult it would be fin4504 cuz there wasn\u2019t a great professor to take it with and also qmb3600 I personally loved but many have trouble with the statistics component but once again if you take it with the right professor it becomes much easier to swallow. Even Gaffe I think is his name he\u2019s great for qmb3600. Otherwise please use rate my professor. It\u2019ll make the difference",

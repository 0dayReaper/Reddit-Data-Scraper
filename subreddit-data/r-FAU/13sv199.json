I heard you could do a diy post bacc now I'm unsure whether FAU would accept those credits. \n\nHas anyone ever done it? What would be the best course of action; at the end of the day, I'd like to get into med school.",

Much cheaper option than a formal post-bacc and there\u2019s a chance you can still get financial aid. You gotta ACE your classes, though. -Advice from someone who\u2019s been there &amp; done that. Feel free to dm questions",

I\u2019m at FSU but graduated with a degree in psychology and reapplied for a second degree in biology as a post bacc just to finish some courses and help take others to boost my science gpa. If you finish your second degree, great. If not, just take what you need to apply and exit the program. It\u2019s quite common",

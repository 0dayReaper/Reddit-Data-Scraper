    "postText": "Hi everyone \ni have a few questions about how the housing is down there. I\u2019m coming from UCF and know that housing for transfers is a severely low chance that they get placed or whatever. With that said, please leave a few off campus places with your experience there if any. No budget thank you \ud83d\ude4f",

Rent is roughly around $2,200/month and it\u2019s right next to FAU - well within walking distance.\n\nThere\u2019s also University Park\u2026 but I\u2019ve heard stories about that place, and with reviews at 3.0 it\u2019s a bit concerning. Rent is roughly $1,500/month and it\u2019s a tad bit further from FAU but still somewhat within walking distance.\n\nThere\u2019s also some other apartments that you can find on the off campus website, just search for FAU Off Campus Housing and it should be one of the first results.",

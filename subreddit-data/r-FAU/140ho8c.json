    "postText": "Hey y'all, I just moved down to Delray Beach from Alabama. I'm a law student and I'll be working here over the summer for my internship. This weekend was super boring because I don't really know anyone around here yet and I'm a bit introverted.\n\nI don't go to FAU, but I'm only 23, so I figured this would be a good subreddit to meet some folks around my age. I'm looking to find some friends in the Boca/Delray/Boynton area to hang out with, grab a beer, catch a movie, just chat, etc. I'm a bit of a homebody, so I'm more interested vibey hanging out than like racaus parties. If you'd like to hang out, hit me up.",

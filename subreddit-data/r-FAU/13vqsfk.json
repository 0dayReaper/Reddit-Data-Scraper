I graduated from FAU and submitted my application 5 weeks ago and still haven't heard back. It says online 4-6 weeks but in a pdf file I found on the program page it says 2-3 weeks. I graduated from FAU and don't see why I wouldn't be accepted but I'm getting a bit antsy and nervous not having a decision since the fall semester is getting closer and classes are starting to fill up. I reached out with a follow up email to the coordinator after I spoke to the graduate college but she still hasn't responded. If you could give me any insight on how long it took for a decision it would be appreciated so much. Again, congratulations on being admitted!",

    "postText": "Is there a relatively big group of students who do intramural basketball on a consistent basis? Such as consistently showing up to play for a team with a schedule and playoffs? I have looked around online and some of it seems a little outdated or just that it is mostly just fraternity based-teams. \n\nA general answer would be great, as I am simply a prospective student looking to see if there is much student involvement in intramurals, specifically basketball. Thanks in advance and I wish the Owls the best of luck in the final 4.",

            "comment": "there\u2019s a set schedule for intramurals and i believe it is once a semester for most sports (including basketball). for intramurals the games get competitive and yes mostly frat teams, but i know a some people who caught the eye of the team organizers and got on a team over their own frat brothers. Also there is a 3v3 tournament for some charity. Besides that, monday-friday there are people hooping at the gym 3pm-10pm consistently, mostly the same people and it\u2019s easy to make friends that way. Obviously around 4-6 most of the best people hoop around that time. Also there are outdoor courts near the baseball stadium but the people who hoop there are inconsistent on creating a routine. Look forward to seeing you hooping at the gym",

Glad that there is a good group that plays it here! I was hopeful that, even though the website looked a bit rough, people do play.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I submitted my application recently to be a transient student at FAU. I was looking at the schedule of courses earlier and most of the classes I wanted were open (for Summer 2023) but PHY2053 quickly filled up. Can anyone tell me if there's any chance I'll be able to get the class since registration for transient students is May 1st? I'm sure the waitlist will fill up by then and I kind of need this class to be on track to graduate. I have no experience or knowledge of FAU's registration process so I have no clue if there are seats reserved for transient students or the like. Thanks",

Not this class but last semester a core class for my major filled before I was allowed to register (I have a tuition waiver threw work and have to wait till the day before the semester starts to register \ud83e\udd72) \n\nHad a mini meltdown and then reached out to my department head who directed me to speak to the professor of the class and let me in. It took a like 24 hours.",

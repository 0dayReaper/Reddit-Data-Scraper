    "postText": "I'm fairly certain that I failed MAC1101 because I was attempting to attend college full-time while working 35 hours a week. I'm wondering if it's still possible to take the course fully online, as the FAU schedule indicates that summer courses begin on May 11 and all the seats and waitlists are currently full. This is making me increasingly anxious, as I did not plan on this until I took my final exam yesterday and saw it drop me to 2 points from passing the class. Thanks.",

I had to take a W for calculus and im taking it again this semester in hopes of passing for real this time",

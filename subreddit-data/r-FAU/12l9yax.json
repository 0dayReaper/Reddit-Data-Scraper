You'd hear kids shows playing from the room every day, and whenever the little kid went to go use our bathroom he never flushed. Not a huge deal, but if you're looking to smoke in your living space you probably wouldn't want to do that with a little kid down the hall?",

There are a bunch of rules you have to follow, which you wouldn't have to deal with off campus - who you can have over and when - and they're only enforced for residents who aren't friends with the RA. This isn't really a big deal, but I found it annoying. For the semester I lived there, the whole building had a carpenter ant infestation. They'd come in no matter how much we sprayed. Then, one girl had to be hospitalized and didn't come back for a couple of months. Each door had an individual lock, and the university would neither send someone in to clean her room nor clean it themselves, which resulted in a fruit fly infestation on top of the ants. We complained to the RAs and the housing department at the university repeatedly, and nothing was done.\n\nI wasn't really enjoying getting matched with randoms to live in a dirty, bug infested dorm.",

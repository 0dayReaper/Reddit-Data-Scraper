I told her she couldn't leave after hitting the car. She said, \"I would never do that! I'll leave a note.\" By the time she parked again there were maybe 5 cars behind me. I parked and went to check on her and the car she hit. **SHE LEFT AND THERE WAS NO NOTE!**\n\nSo I left a note on this person's car, but I was so upset that someone could drive away that I also called campus PD, showed the officer the footage and gave him the woman's license plate number (which I took note of as I passed her to park my car).

But come on, how do you not know if you hit another car?! Even if it\u2019s just a tap like that. No one will be angry with you for accidentally hitting the car- it\u2019s called an accident for a reason. But she chose to leave without owning up to it and THAT\u2019S shitty. ",

You\u2019re an awesome person though and if that my car that she hit, I know I would really appreciate everything you did plus that fact you got it all the dash cam. Some people at this school though... jeez",

I\u2019m actually a bit worried nothing came of it because after talking to the officer, he told me he would go check out the car, but there was nothing he could really do if the person who was hit didn\u2019t make a complaint. After class I came back to the garage to find that the car was still there, but my note was gone and the scratch looked like someone tried to rub it out. I really feel like the officer took my note because no one has contacted me about it. And I feel guilty that I didn\u2019t leave another note right then :( \n",

Here's how to get a little help, you'll be glad you payed that transportation access fee !\n\nCall the FAU parking and transportation department, tell them your battery is dead, they'll ask for the lot number, vehicle etc. Then they'll direct you to the  FAU PD , and they'll send someone on a golf cart to your vehicle with a jumpstarter kit! Very helpful if you don't have roadside assistance or jumper cables. \n\n",

So I went down to P&amp;T and asked if I still had to pay it, what with me not actually using the parking lot that it pays for. They tell me if I don't pay it, I just won't get a parking decal. So I don't. They put a hold on my account and wouldn't let me register for classes. So I go back again and ask about the hold. Student services says only P&amp;T can remove it. So I go back to P&amp;T and they tell me to pay it, and come back to get it refunded after classes start. Practical. I like it. Deal with important stuff now, then get it taken care of after. I go back after classes start and they tell me policy states that fees can never be refunded.   \n\nAlso, jumping a car. [Red clamp on red battery terminal, black clamp on some other part of the engine](https://www.cookiesandclogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jumper-cables-01a.jpg). Guy with good car runs his for a bit, then you try to start your car. That simple. $10 for some cables to keep in your trunk and give you piece of mind. Spend a little more, get nice thick ones. Even better, for $35 get a [LiPo jump pack from walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Red-Fuel-Portable-Jump-Starter-and-Battery-Charger/54459184) and never have to worry about being stranded again. Not great for your alternator, but you can use it to start your car for a while, while you come up with the $130 you need for a new battery. Or for the next Pokemon Go craze. Hot places like S. FL kill batteries in a couple of years.",

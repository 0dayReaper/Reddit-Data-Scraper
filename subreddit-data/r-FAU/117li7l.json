I highly doubt you\u2019d need a car.\n\nAlso for roommate requests - once you complete a housing contract and housing tells you that they were able to secure you a room, you\u2019ll be asked what lifestyle preferences you have. This includes things like temperature, whether you plan to use the room for studying / socializing, etc. After that a list of your best matches will pop up. You\u2019ll be able to request them to join your roommate group.\n\nThere\u2019ll also be an option to request a certain person, but I don\u2019t remember where that is since I haven\u2019t been able to get housing for a bit.",

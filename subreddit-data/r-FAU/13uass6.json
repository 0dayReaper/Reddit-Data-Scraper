    "postText": "If you get an email claiming there's a temporary administrative assistant position from NGO Recruitment Relief, it's a scam! There're Reddit posts discussing people who've gotten the same email, and a Broward College student was scammed last year.\n\nIt came from a 2023 student email (formatted to look like it came from the Financial Aid office) with an attached letter from the \"recruiter\" claiming that the work consisted of \"[purchasing] some items when needed\" and other simple secretarial duties. It was a two day a week, one hour a day position with a pay of $250/hr, for a $500/week total.\n\nA shit ton of red flags! If something seems like it's too good to be true, it probably is :') Always research employers ahead of time, y'all! And double check where your emails are coming from!",

            "comment": "UCF would be my top choice but that\u2019s mostly because I\u2019m a hospitality major. It depends on a whole bunch of stuff which has different importance for each person: tuition cost, nightlife, clubs, student body size, class size, class availability, size of the major, importance of the major to the school, sources of job opportunities. \n\nMy roommate from fall2021-spring2022 transferred to USF starting summer 2022. She did it mostly because of tuition and being closer to her family (she lived in tampa). I have friends who go to UCF who find it mid and they feel isolated because of the massive student size. I personally would\u2019ve loved to go to UCF because of the theme parks and job opportunities for them, but absolutely LOVE FAU and feel like I finally have school spirit.\n\nif it\u2019s for the football team, UCF tho. (hopefully we get better with this new coach)",

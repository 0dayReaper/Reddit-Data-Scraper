    "postText": "Hey guys so theres these 2 classes im registering for and im a bit confused. For one of them it says Term 3, Second half term. The other one says Term 2, First half term.\n\nSo if it says first or second term, is that considered an express class? And do I have to choose another class that says first half term since the one i just registered for says second half term? It wont let me do this so im assuming no, and I read what the fau website says they mean but im still not sure. I appreciate your help",

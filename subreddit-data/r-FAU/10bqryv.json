Search up FAU Employment and should be information on it. \n\nSalary isn't the best but the secret benefit is after 6 months probationary period for full time employees, FAU covers up to 6 credits per sem for any degree you want if you keep the conditions of passing your classes per semester. I'm doing that post grad since I already have a student employment job on campus, what's 2.5 years gonna kill me for MBA if it's free and I take my time to pass.\n\nSo yea do read the terms of conditions for employment benefits because despite pay not the best it could be decent if you play your cards right",

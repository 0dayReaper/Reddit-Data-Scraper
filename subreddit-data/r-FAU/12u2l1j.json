    "postText": "I will be heading to law school in August, but wanted to reach out and inquire about if anyone in Boca needed LSAT tutoring. For those familiar with the scoring, I started with a 146, and raised my score to a 168 over the course of 6 months. I also still have access to LSAT max\u2014 an online tutoring service\u2014 and would be happy to share the materials in it. \n\nI am open to tutoring in person or remote, and am looking for about $45 an hour (but willing to negotiate). Please pm or contact me at ptartaro21@aol.com if you are interested!",

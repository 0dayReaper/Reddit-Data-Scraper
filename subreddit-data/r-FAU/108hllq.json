    "postText": "Apparently there's a new restriction for online courses at FAU, in which there is not allowed to be any interactions between online and in-person sections. Meaning, no live lectures online from in-person courses, only pre-recorded ones. It seems there's also some stipulation preventing students from even being visible or audible in these recordings, since one of my professors kept telling students to not get in front of the camera and said that she wont answer any questions any students have until she turns off the recording, which she stated is part of the new rules.\n\nDoes this make any sense???",

Basically comes down to putting a hard line between online and and in-person education. Got to imagine this will be the end of a lot of the hybrid programs FAU loves to advertise. Also assume this change will be happening at other Florida public universities, but have yet to hear anything specifically. Will try to ask some UCF friends tomorrow.",

I guess that has something to do with the online cheating war, but the truth is that this is not going to resolve any issues, on the contrary, it's going to aggravate them.",

Maybe if it is a dedicated \"in-person\" lecture they don't want people to just sit at home and not attend is what I'd assume, but other than that I haven't heard anything about it",

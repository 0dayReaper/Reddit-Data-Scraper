            "comment": "I'm taking this class right now with that professor. Initially I was very worried this was going to be a difficult class. I tried taking this class once at my previous college over the summer and online just like I am here and I had to withdraw. But so far the class seems very manageable. I'm sure as the class goes along the math with get harder but the assignments (labs) seem to be very reasonable. \n\nYou use a website called limes which you buy for $69. The class is designed so it has 10-11 labs which are basically your assignments. You can only do labs when they are available. The calendar on the limes website shows you when labs are available and when they are due. Some have a week long availability others 3 days from what I can see so far. But the work load is smaller with the shorter due dates. There are lectures to read through about what you'll be doing in the lab. Lectures have questions but don't count towards your grade. More of a practice to make sure you understand the material. There's also 3 exams and a final. All labs, exams 1, 2, 3 and the final are each waited 20% of your grade. Lowest 4 labs can also be dropped. \n\nAs for the professor he seems very communicative. I probably have 10+ messages already about making sure we stay on top of our assignments and being registered and such. He seems like he would be very helpful if you needed to reach out to him for help. Or at the least be able to direct you to someone who can help you. (Not that he doesn't want to help but in one of the messages he said that many students come up with issues when using Excel that someone else has much more experience solving than he does)\n\nHope this helps. Feel free to ask any other questions.",

I\u2019m referring to Ai Beng Radulovic.\n\nstats itself is not a hard math class at all in my opinion. it\u2019s pretty mundane and not very fun, kinda like an accounting class or something. do you need to be a math wiz to pass it? no not at all.",

If a hurricane where to hit you\u2019d honestly probably be in one of the safest places to be by staying in your dorm. I don\u2019t know exactly what their hurricane plan is but South Florida is obviously very susceptible to hurricanes as a threat so I am very doubtful they would evacuate dorms since it would be full of none locals with nowhere to go. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this to downplay the destruction they cause but they honestly aren\u2019t that big of a deal, its really just a lot of sitting and waiting around till it passes, and you have plenty of time to prepare for them because you can track the cone and see if you\u2019ll be in an area if direct impact or not days/weeks in advanced.",

            "comment": "They will do what they can to cancel classes as early as they can. I attended FAU when we were supposed to get a category 5 - what I remember was that they didn't allow students to stay on campus. The reason for that is for obvious safety reasons. I can't speak if it was for this specific hurricane or just their hurricane policy. So, most of my friends either drove to the other side of the state to avoid the hit from the hurricane or they stayed with family. If for any reason you didn't have the option, you were told to arrange plans to stay at the local shelter. I imagine the university was putting all their effort to help the students do that - so fret not, do not worry about it. \n\nI will also say that others (native floridians) can be sympathetic about this. We often joke about \"hurricane parties\" and having a good time despite the circumstances. I think if you have a roommate or make a friend during college - they'll more than unlikely offer you help in giving you a place to crash until then. I know when I had a friend from Argentina at FAU, I offered her a place to stay so she wouldn't have to drive to Miami. My friend from high school was also fortunate to have a college roommate that allowed her to stay with them during the duration of another heavy hurricane. In other words, I would say native floridians collectively try to help out those unaccustomed to it - probably because we have seen the worse of the worse and the suffering it can cause.\n\nSaying that, DO plan for the worse.\n\n1. Make sure you stock up on AA batteries now (don't wait till they forcast a storm or you will NOT find any in the store). Stock up on a good first aid kit. \n2. Consider getting walkie talkies and making a plan with someone you trust in case of something happening.\n3. Get a radio because you can listen into the news stations.\n4. Freeze bags/bottles of water &amp; fill the tub with water. The power will go out and it can be for hours or weeks - depending on how destructive the hurricane is. We went one whole summer w/o power - no schools and FEMA was once out and ensuring the law was still being followed. Not to scare you, but to prepare you. The ice will ensure to keep either some food cold or allow it to be as drinking water. The tub of water will be good in case you don't have access to water for washing or cleaning yourself (or as a last scenario for drinking water).\n5. Avoid all and any areas of water outside - obvious, but goes to say that you can't ever know what was carried into a lake or what flooded waters contain (metals, glass, electric wires).\n6. It's okay to buy \\*some toliet paper, but its not your priority. \n7. Do not show up empty handed if someone is able to house you (should be obvious, but I know cultures are different). If you're staying somewhere with others, ask if they have a generator. Gas is something that can go a long way when the florida heat blazes on.\n8. Get cans of food that you wouldn't need to heat up to eat - its okay to get some for heating up, but in the case you don't have power ...useless and don't want to make yourself sick. (particularly cans that contain meat).\n9. Don't open the fridge/freezer unless absolutely needed - power goes out and the timer starts when things spoil\n10. Fill your car with gas ASAP. People will rush to get gas and it will cause lines, shortages, and complicate the next few hours. If you have a generator, get gas for that too.\n\nI think that's the basics. Remember that it's unpredictable sometimes, so driving to the other coast can actually put you back on target (if the trajectory changes once it hits land). Above all else, avoid the beaches and the coasts. Middle of the state tends to be the safest. Avoid Miami and West palm as these are high flood zones.",

This means you will have to find somewhere else to wait out the storm. Students that really have nowhere to go (international students) will be brought to a shelter. This is not a fun place to be. There is a chance that the shelter shuts down before housing opens so you will be SOL.",

You will have to make arrangements off campus (with a friend or family maybe), or they will help transport you to a shelter. FAU will wait til the day or two before to announce campus shutting down. This is also the case if you decide to work while in college, businesses will wait to close.\n\nI worked in housing during Hurricane Irma 2017, which wasnt even a direct hit to Palm Beach. Campus was closed for 2 weeks. Ive grown up and lived in Broward my whole life, luckily I didnt lose power but a lot of locals did and it took awhile for life to resume as normal. \n\nI dont mean to scare you, if its a school youre really considering. I got my BA and MA here. FL Natives always downplay hurricanes, often we're fine but its been years since a major one has rolled through (2005 season, Katrina/Wilma. My family had no power for a month after Wilma).",

    "postText": "So I am currently a senior and applied Nov 30th for Computer Science, I took 3 years of math and at my school AP Computer Science counts as a math credit so I didn't worry about it. Now I'm stressing out because I don't think it counts as a math credit since SSAR puts it in the Computer Science category. Will it affect my chances of getting in?",

Also failed most my AP exams and also got suspended (I was a rebellious student lol which I regret but don\u2019t )I was completely honestly in my application, and I applied for summer and got accepted.  My gpa was not amazing and my attendance was bad (112+ absences) a year. My SAT was good tho. So I feel it\u2019s all in ur spirit and SAT\nTO ADD my SAT was good but still slightly below the requirement for summer lol, so even then I got accepted. I was in contact with admissions as well and it helped get my name out there",

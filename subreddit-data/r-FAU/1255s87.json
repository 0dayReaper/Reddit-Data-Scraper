    "postText": "So I recently reapplied to FAU as a local student, I have a really lovely weighted gpa of 2.8, but a decent SAT score of 1160 and multiple extracurriculars such as Football and Debate. I changed my major from engineering to a much more easier major to get into on my second application. I\u2019m still waiting on an official decision, but after calling admissions they said they only looking for people with a 3.0 weighted and above. Are my chances really gone?",

I know I shouldn\u2019t care what she thinks, but she\u2019s done a lot for me and I feel like the least I can do is be able to attend FAU.",

Plus it's good you're local and not trying to live on campus since they have a housing crunch. If you don't get accepted try again in the spring, after a semester of community college and better grades. Please come back and let us know if you got in!!!",

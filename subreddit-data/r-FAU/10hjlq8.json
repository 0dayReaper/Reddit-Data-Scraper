    "postText": "I'm starting to want to avoid the Breezeway.  Can't even walk to class without 3 guys asking me to sign a petition and a bunch of people yelling Bible verses.  Not to mention the intercoms blasting the same songs over and over.  I know FAU \"believes in the first amendment\" or whatever that Kanye email said, but c'mon.  I am assuming the solicitors pay FAU to be there, but really?  Does FAU really need that money?  When they have over 20,000 students each paying thousands of dollars already?\n\nThe Breezeway club tables are fine because at least they are run by students.  Just wish their tables didn't clog up foot traffic so much.  The store stands are fine too.  Just the petitioners and missionaries are so obnoxious.",

They won\u2019t kick them off out of fear of getting sued which is very very valid as these guys are looking for that to happen to sue the Uni. Private unis like PBA and Lynn on the other hand kick those guys off right away.",

Florida Atlantic University believes in the freedoms provided by the First Amendment; however, we also denounce Anti-Semitism in all its forms.  Although no security threat was identified, FAU Police were in the area to provide security as needed.\"\n\nLike, yeah great you're against someone spewing nonsense hate against over 1.5k of your students.  But why did you let this person set up a booth in the first place???",

FAU is just a generally smaller campus than the average state university so you are gonna see them more often.\n\nThe breezeway gets disgustingly crowded though lol I sometimes just take the longer way around if I'm not in a rush just so I don't have to navigate through a crowd",

However, with the breezeway being established as a freedom of speech breezeway, it is a public forum very similar to the source you are using now just IRL; With that being said you are supposed to be bombarded by a lot of the opposing avenues of thought. You may not agree with most however it does help to understand them and so long as they aren't causing mayhem physically or have a literal call to arms I don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to speak just like everyone else. \nP.s\nI am not defending any \"hate speech\", solicitation,  etc. Simply believe that everyone is entitled to the very least their word and should have a safe platform to express it and find other like-minded individuals if that is the result.  I love a good discussion if one is willing to listen to the opposing side free of emotion.",

When I told my dad what happened with the whole anti semitism incident he was surprised that anyone was just allowed to walk on campus and start doing stuff without approval. He simply couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nI think this should apply equally to every group that\u2019s trying to do stuff on the breezeway, also. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re trying to discuss the Bible, or getting petition signatures for a political party - you should have to get approval for it.\n\nAnd not only just because I think we shouldn\u2019t have just anyone be allowed to spread their message, sometimes I just want to be able to walk down the breezeway without being stopped every couple of feet. Like no, I don\u2019t care about your Bible study group. I don\u2019t care about your yoga books. I don\u2019t care about your petition for a non aligned party or whatever, just let me get to the god damned Dunkin in peace.",

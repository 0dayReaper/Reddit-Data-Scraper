    "postText": "Hey, I\u2019m a freshman at the WHC who\u2019s doing premed. Can anyone tell me about the success rate of premeds here? How many students a year are successful in getting accepted into medical schools? Are there any who went to top 30 medical schools?\n\nI\u2019m hoping I made the right choice of sticking with the WHC for the research since I want to get into a top ranked med school, but I\u2019m worried FAU\u2019s lack of prestige could harm my chances.",

            "comment": "Don\u2019t focus on prestige, and there are multiple reasons why. 1. Prestige is one thing, but resume is another. Focus more on the resources at WHC (which imo are very good bc of how reputable they are and how easy they are to access). 2. Prestige doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as you think it does for med school. Many med schools won\u2019t recognize it unless it\u2019s a household name school. \n\nI\u2019m going off some estimated from my head that I got when I questioned admissions but I\u2019m pretty sure about the accuracy. Currently, 75% of the WHC is STEM focused. Of that, 65% want to go to med school. 80% (for the year of 2021) were accepted, about 10% of which were to fau med. 5 candidates went to a MdPhd program, the most notable being the Harvard-MIT one and the Duke one. Many candidates who went to Md-only programs were accepted across the nation, including T10-T30s. In the HC building you\u2019ll find a map showing where the best got accepted to. \n\nI\u2019ll say this as someone who\u2019s going through it now and as someone who kinda sees the pattern from the previous years, but unironically the WHC is goated for resources on your resume and experience. JMC is nearby for hospital volunteering, Cleveland clinic for shadowing, MPFI Scripps Brain for research, plenty of clubs and very helpful professors due to the small class size.\n\nIf you were between UF and WHC (saving money gang), and you\u2019re majoring in Neuro, Bio, or biochem, I\u2019d say you made the right choice as long as you put the effort in.\n\nEdit: also there\u2019s like wayyy more help for finding these resources than there should be. Professors will help you find opportunities, Maldonado will help with internships, clubs like CSIDE and Pre Med society give specific student advice, etc. Classes are a breeze if you\u2019re aiming high so build that resume, and opportunities are more readily accepting than places like UF due to a way smaller class size and less competition. Students are friendly and the non-competitive atmosphere is very refreshing.",

It\u2019s true that I was stuck between the WHC and larger schools like UF, but I\u2019m glad to know that most medical schools focus on resume instead. I think it\u2019s great that there are so many opportunities and resources at Wilkes and a friendly atmosphere, this definitely gives me more confidence about my choice!\ud83d\ude0a",

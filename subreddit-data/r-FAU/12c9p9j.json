            "comment": "Do you have your first two years/AA completed?\n\nI was a returning student but from Florida so its very different for in State people because Florida has the 2/2 rule (If you complete your associates your guaranteed acceptance to any public university in the state) \n\nThey\u2019re not one of the Big big schools yet so they\u2019re a bit easier to get into, google says a min of a 3.23 for acceptance into summer term. Try reaching out to admissions and discuss options, if your not ready yet grades wise an option might be to move down and go to Palm Beach State College (There is a campus right next to the Main FAU campus in boca) establish residency and then when you complete your AA you\u2019ll qualify for the 2/2 rule. (Note* 2/2 will grant you acceptance to FAU but if you\u2019re applying to be in a selective program then your not guaranteed to be accepted into that program ex: The art program you have to apply to be in the BFA program during your junior year. If you\u2019re denied you\u2019d be in the BA program concentrated in Studio Art.) \n\nPBSC is cheaper as well so itll save you some on your out of state tuition as well. The first two years is gen eds where ever you go so don\u2019t stress that.",

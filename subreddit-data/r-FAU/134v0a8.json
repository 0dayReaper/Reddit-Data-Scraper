South Florida\u2019s public transportation isn\u2019t the greatest, its very car centric so you\u2019d need to live directly next to campus if you don\u2019t have a car and that area is very expensive ($1800-2300 usd minimum) for a one bed one bathroom apartment, studios are virtually non existent in this area.\n\nIf you will be getting a car while here, Deerfield, Coconut creek, Pompano are some good options for housing. A little cheaper (not by much) and a pretty nice areas to live in. Your best bet if looking for off campus housing would be to find a roommate but DO NOT transfer money ahead. Scams are rampant and especially rental scams in South Florida. \n\nCulturally South Florida is kinda funny, its equally culturally diverse as it is not. It sounds like an oxymoron but it will make sense when you arrive. \n\nFriends wise, the university has a lot of program clubs, I would reach out to your department and see what they offer, that will put you in touch with your peers who hopefully will become your friend group over time. There are also some cultural groups and different clubs in campus theyll be advertising that during the fall some that may be something to look into as well. Another added bonus to living in on campus housing would be an easier way to network and make friends since youll all be together in the same walk if life basically. \n\nWhat program are you in? Im in the Masters of Urban and Regional Planning program myself.",

I would highly recommend joining organizations and network with the professors. There's some very accomplished ones, so I would recommend doing some research under a professor. OURI is a department you wanna go to for that.\n\nLike for culture, pretty laid back, but as mentioned above, many people with drive if you look in the right places.\nAs for accommodation I wish I could be of more assistance, but I commute. You don't really have to live in Boca (where is is quite expensive), since FAU has a higway exit on I95 going straight in, you could reasonably live further up north for cheaper and still get to campus in like 30 mins.",

With a supposed weekly gas bill of $50, that's $200 to get to and from FAU per month. Regular maintenance per year, let's say another $1000. So with an initial buy in of $7000 of car, and maybe $12,000 in tuition, that's $19,000 or nineteen thousand dollars just to get started. Your day to day bill of gas for commuting for the first semester brings you to just north of $20,000. Idk the particulars of rent close enough to give you figures, but it's not pretty the closer you get to Miami. I'm sure FAU offers aid and scholarship funding for international students if you look and ask for it. Good luck",

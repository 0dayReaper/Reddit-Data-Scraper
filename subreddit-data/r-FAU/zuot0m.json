He\u2019s a grad student, so he will naturally more lenient and understanding of any issues. I\u2019ve also worked with him in the MLC, he\u2019s very good at explaining things. Perhaps the waitlist will work out here. \n\nBrittaney Adelmann also gets fantastic reviews on RMP. She\u2019s extremely nice as well. There\u2019s one seat left, so move fast! \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with Keiko Ito, but I know the other two are great. I\u2019d go with them before Keiko.",

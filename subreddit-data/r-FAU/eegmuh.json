    "postText": "I'm Owlsley, official owl of FAU!!!!!!! This is my nog recipe, get crunk! No alcohol if you are under 21\n\nYou will need: 2 bottles of dark rum, 2 bottles of bourbon, 12 eggs, some maple syrup(to taste), 4 cups of sugar, 4 cups of heavy whipping cream, 10 cups of nutmeg(plus more for garnish), 6 cups of whole milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and a pinch of salt. And a big cinnamon stick, which you'll use to mix it all up. Here I come I am cinnie mon\n\nMost importantly, put in some of your love and heart and holiday cheer for some extra tasty nog. I cry a salty teardrop into the mix when I'm out of pinches of salt. Drinking nog made from my own tears is a way that I cope with my recent friendship breakup with Lane Kiffin, but that's all the oversharing I'll do for now. \n\nHere's how to prepare the nog: \n\nStep 1: put all the ingredients into an appropriate container and mix them up with the cinnamon stick. Sprinkle some nutmeg on top and bada bing bada boom you done it\n\nStep 2: drink it or store it in the fridge. I recommend having company to drink it with I'm having Carrot Top over for dinner soon. Last year, Carrot Top dunked his head in the eggnog and he got his red hair all soaking. He said \"Now I am Eggnog Top\" \n\nStep 3: party time\n\nparty party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party party\n\nyeah!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe holidays are a time to relax. Finals are over, the year is over, hopefully you're with your friends and family, coddled by their warmth. I want to encourage my fellow owls to reflect on their year, and their decade. How can you make the year 2020, such a special number, into a worthy enough year? With the beginning of the new year,comes a new beginning, and maybe even a new perspective. But don't wait until January 1st to create your new self. Start now, or you never will. \n\nIt may be raining a lot these days. But alas, sunglasses on, it's nog time.",

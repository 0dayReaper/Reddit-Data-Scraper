I had 2 professors which I didn\u2019t really get along with, but besides them I enjoyed my classes. CS as a major is a lot of self learning and I don\u2019t think that changes much wherever you choose to go. The courses are solid and depending on which you take you get to do some hands-on work that can easily translate into real work. About 3 months after graduating I got my first and current CS-related job, and a lot of what I learned has been useful to a degree, even some stuff I thought I would never use. I would say the program is pretty good and it\u2019s probably only gotten better since I\u2019ve left.",

I wish we had more project based assignments but my entire resume for my first job was my senior project and a few others just to showcase what I learned. \n\nI feel as FAU grows we are getting better at outreach with internships. I mean we\u2019re a smaller school than UF or UCF so sometimes less outreach is done to campus. \n\nBut I had a professor that said \u201ca degree is a sheet of paper that proves you know the foundations and how to be taught\u201d. Anyone will teach you what they need you to learn",

I go to FAU and I'm not even part of this FAU reddit.\n\nSo I've been doing the Bachelor of Arts at FAU, previously considering moving to UCF for their computer science program/digital media. I got scared because after researching, their foundation exam at UCF is hard and not that many people pass it. The cost is generally the same. Why?  Its in a tech hub with Electronic Arts and all these other big companies that fund the school to hire the new grads. Being at FAU, I do have opportunities, but it feels like south Florida is lacking on cool jobs. I might be wrong, but everyone I know has a remote internship or will need to move outstate/ other places in Florida.  Some people last semester got picked up by Google and Nasa.\n\nSo pros with UCF:\n\n\\- will most likely get a good job, good connections, making a bachelor's degree enough\n\n\\- costs typically the same; they have a lot of scholarships that you can apply for and get accepted in.\n\nI went to FAU because I am better at self-teaching and I'm really looking to become a UX Designer, instead of an engineer/software developer (the more technical part)  My professor now, Sarah Taebi is an amazing professor at FAU. Cardei (who no longer teaches Intro to Compute) was horrible because he speaks in a monotone and gives you advanced graduate-level coursework. He was absolutely difficult for no reason. (we went over in 4 months 10-15 chapters.)  However, I learned a lot from studying so much that it has made understanding more advanced concepts easier. But this was self-taught. Everything honestly has been self-taught, but it's because of code. You gotta just do it on your own and practice.  Bagby is also one that I take now for Computer Logic/Intro to python, and is basically self teaching because he is hard to pay attention too. Ali was a easy teacher. Did not attend/listen to a lecture once.\n\nHowever I do like FAU. Theres an A.I/Virtual Reality Lab, with people who can help you and do really cool things as an extracurricular. The Engineering building as on the first floor this place where a lot of Computer Science people hang out and study together. there are discord groups that are pretty engaging with others within our major.\n\nthere's a lot of modern/gorgeous places to study, not sure how it is at UCF. but idk its a tough decision. I would say go to UCF, but if you do decide FAU. It's not like its a bad school to attend, especially since they have made it more desirable. There's people from Google, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Sachs that have come here looking for interns. Recently Estee Lauder reached out to me to come to New York for their e-commerce store, and I got invited to interview with Ebay.\n\nI like it here because I have the time to pursue my own personal projects that will be relevant to the career I go into.  Hope this helps\n\n\nUpdate: I got the internship at Estee Lauder :)",

Honestly I\u2019m still thinking about it, UCF seems really good when it comes to making connections although like half the people there fail the foundation exam, but FAU doesn\u2019t seem all that bad  (plus it\u2019s way closer to me so I wouldn\u2019t have to do dorms which seems pricey) and it also seems to offer a lot of opportunities too ^^",

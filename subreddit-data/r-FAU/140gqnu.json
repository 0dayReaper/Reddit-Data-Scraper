First, if you qualify for work study which is a form of federal financial aid, the financial aid office can point you in the direction of work study jobs on campus. If not going through work study, there will also be job listings for on campus positions on the FAU HR website https://www.fau.edu/jobs/ and possibly on the Career Center website Handshake https://fau.joinhandshake.com/login. You'd be filtering for student jobs on these sites. \n\nThe bookstore I believe might hire separately and so might the food places on campus. Visiting and asking about jobs when you are on campus might be the best way to find out.",

The deadline to withdraw, which you are still responsible to pay for and results in a W on your record, is also passed. It was March 24 this semester. At this point you can only petition to late withdraw if you had some extenuating circumstances and you should talk to your advisor about that if it applies to you.",

Idk how its done so reach out to your advisor but basically what it is is you repeat the class do better and they wipe put the failed class. You can only do it once. Idk what sort of paperwork needs to be done for it but ive definitely heard a few people in my program having done it before.",

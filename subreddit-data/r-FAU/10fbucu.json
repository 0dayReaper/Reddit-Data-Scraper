                    "comment": "Great question!!! I probably work too much but here are some thoughts:\n\n-the skill sets that you gain can be broken up into four different areas: planning (so essentially mapping the supply to the demand  and coordinating all of the elements together to ensure that the next three sections work smoothly), sourcing (the acquisition and maintenance of materials and resources from outside of the firm into the firm), making or manufacturing (production of goods and services, and finally delivery (outbound distribution of products and services)\n\n-in all cases, analytical and problem-solving abilities become critical. \n\n-so depending on which area you work in the constraints and demands of the job will vary. If you were tasked with supplier selection and examining sources of supply for a new projects or products that are being manufactured then quality checks and other controls may be required so spot visits to factory sites might be a common thing which may include a lot of international travel.  By contrast, if you end up taking on a role which is common out of school like let\u2019s say a buyer/planner you may be in the office more. Essentially it all depends on which area of the supply chain you end up working in.\n\n-to the point about running a sustainable business much like anything else it would depend on the area that you end up working in however, if you look at bureau of labor, statistics for the supply chain field, broadly, defined, over the next 10 to 15 years there\u2019s an approximate 30% growth projection in our field, which is to say the demand is quite high!\n\nI hope this helps and of course please let me know if you have any more questions",

                    "comment": "Another awesome question! One of the classes that I teach here at FAU is QMB6616 (supply chain analytics) which is a requirement for our masters in supply chain (and an elective for various other programs). I break up the course into three sections: (1) descriptive analytics, (2) predictive analytics, and (3) prescriptive analytics. The first bit talks about what *is* or *has* happened, the next bit looks at what might happen (also including *why* it happened), and the last bit makes recommendations what to do.\n\nSome tools we use:\n\n* R (a statistical software)\n* Tableau\n* Power BI\n* Excel\n\nThe analytical field of SCM is a growing one for sure, and there are numerous job openings (i.e. supply chain analyst, logistics analyst, procurement analyst, etc.)\n\nGreat question, and I hope this helps!",

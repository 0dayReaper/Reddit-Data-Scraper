I spent a total of 5.5 years there and earned 2 degrees. Overall, the experience is what you make of it. I made lifelong friends there and had great mentors that shaped me into who I am today. I enjoyed being close to home (I live by FAU), abundance of restaurants to eat at and the many places you can go to around in the area.\n\nThe school has changed much since I graduated. They now have a medical school and a football stadium.\n\nUSF is also a great school. My wife went there for 5 years as well and had nothing bad to say about it. \n\nThe atmosphere in Tampa is most certainly different than the one in south FL. South FL has beaches, malls, abundance of restaurants and much more night life than Tampa. I currently live by USF and if I had to pick between going to both schools, I'm going to FAU again.\n\nGO OWLS \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd89",

Would never consider going to USF have tons of friends there and every time I visit idc for it besides the big ass campus which is horribly designed. They have one good college bar and it sucks.",

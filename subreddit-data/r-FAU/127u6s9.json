    "postText": "hi guys. i got accepted into FAU\u2019s grad program and plan to move there august 1st. does anyone have suggestions for apartments relatively close by? i have looked at a few that are almost 2k a month which blows my mind, so if anyone has cheaper suggestions that would be so, so appreciated. (also, i know it\u2019s florida, i know it\u2019s expensive, but i am still hoping to find a place to live that doesn\u2019t make surviving difficult.) thank you!",

    "postText": " \n\nHello everyone!\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am an international student who will be attending Florida Atlantic University in the upcoming semester, and I am hoping to get some insights on the cost of living in the Boca Raton area.\n\nCan anyone recommend some affordable accommodation options near the campus that are safe and convenient for students? Additionally, what kind of costs should I be expecting to cover when living in Boca Raton? Are there any hidden expenses that I should be aware of?\n\nAny advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

            "comment": "Honestly I would advise you to consider living on campus at least for your first semester till you get your barrings. Florida has very limited public transportation options so unless you live directly next to campus you\u2019ll need a car. \n\nSouth Florida in general is very expensive $1800-2k for a small apartment in the surrounding areas, there are slight less expensive options like Pompano, Coconut creek, Deerfield but like I mentioned the Public transportation option in South Florida arent that great so id be concerned about how you\u2019d make it to class without a car.",

You'll be much happier on campus, located where you need to be with other people who are also students and the like. Maybe move off campus after your first year once you make some friends and find a trustable roommate.",

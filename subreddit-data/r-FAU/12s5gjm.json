    "postText": "Hi! I am an incoming freshman, majoring in poli sci/pre-law. My mom is encouraging me to join a sorority. I just had a few questions if anyone would be willing to answer :).\n\n1. I am living off campus, do I need to be on campus to join one?\n2. Are the sororities at FAU actually leadership and opportunity oriented? Part of the reason I went to FAU instead of UM is because I am focused on school and not partying. I want to be around people who are the same way, and definitely wouldn\u2019t want to join a sorority if it\u2019s just going to be partying. \n3. Any general opinions or comments on FAU sororities?",

It\u2019s pretty low key, looks great on applications, and give you a lot of study material to help with the LSAT! You don\u2019t need to live on campus to be in a sorority, in-fact most people live off campus anyway\u2026 the greek life at FAU is different due to there being no greek houses. However, it\u2019s still a great opportunity! There is also a club called Women In Law that you can join. Not going to lie, these groups are not the typical sorority. Compared to the typical sororities, the ones i mentioned above are pretty dedicated in their studies and even though you can find a handful of people in typical sororities who are dedicated to their studies i find them to more compelled to having a good time. I think anyone would enjoy their college experience more if they were to join clubs or sororities. Best of luck!",

Yes they are usually leadership oriented but of course there will be people who like to party etc. the sororities normally have rules about social media use etc. so it teaches girls to be careful about what they post and how to act. Hopefully lol. \n3. No comment, I\u2019m almost 10 years out of college now and am a guy. They are probably similar to when I was around but there\u2019s more of them now. If you do recruitment you\u2019ll get a general idea of each.",

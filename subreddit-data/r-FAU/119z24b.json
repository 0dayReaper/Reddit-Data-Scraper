I don\u2019t know what you plan on doing with your degree, but that is just more of a problem with getting a history degree in general than it is an FAU problem. I\u2019m a middle school math teacher in Colorado now for reference lol.\n\nEDIT - Since posting this, I have learned that Dr. Breslow retired at the end of last semester from teaching after 51 years at FAU. He was an amazing professor and pillar of the history department.",

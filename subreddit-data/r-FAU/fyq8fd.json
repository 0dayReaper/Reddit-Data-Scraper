I know 2 have used the engineering labs bc im now in self isolation bc I was there for an hour\n\nNote- I talked w a Dr at student health services who said my risk is probably low bc I was alone and used a ton of hand sanitizer while there. But FAU is still monitoring me and making me fill out a form on my temperature and possible symptoms\n\nEdit- feel free to DM me if you want any info",

I had my personal hand sanitizer I used too. \n\nThe projects are still due but we can write what limitations we have (ie- lack of lab access for the next 2 weeks means no 3D printing or circuit board designs being printed). Mixed with I shouldn\u2019t be in contact with anyone besides my family when necessary due to my limited risk",

    "postText": "My cousin is thinking of attending FAU\u2019s honors college in Jupiter BUT housing is filled. What options do they have for attending if they can\u2019t drive? Are there apartments that are walking distance? And what is campus life like? How do you all feel about it?\n\nI want to help them make a good decision.",

            "comment": "ALL of the housing being filled is rare, I\u2019m surprised . There are apartments a short distance away from campus, but like most housing in South Florida it\u2019s pretty expensive if you\u2019re not rooming with other people. Campus life is active but there\u2019s not many students in the college in the first place. There\u2019s holiday celebrations, a universal trip, and plenty of recreational clubs, but whatever you are imagining, scale it down to campus that has just under 1000 students across all 4 classes. The WHC is a lot more suited for people who can make their own niches and groups, social life wise. Tho most of the reason people go to WHC is because of the whole honors-student ordeal. If your cousin really wants a more traditional social college life, FAU Boca is the better bet.",

    "postText": "According to FAU Announcement email, we are going back in person full time in the fall. \n\n \n\n&gt;To the FAU community,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As the widespread public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues, most recently with a national roll out of vaccinations, FAU is planning a full on-campus, in-person instruction and campus experience for the Fall 2021 semester.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While we always will strictly comply with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) guidelines, we are planning to offer the vast majority of our courses in-person, and we expect our faculty and staff to fully return to all campuses. A return to a \u201ctraditional\u201d semester will not only bring us back together, but also reinvigorate our vibrant campus life and activities so all students can experience the most engaging collegiate experience possible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;More details will be made available as the Fall semester nears. In the meantime, please stay safe and well, and I look forward to seeing you on our campuses again soon.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;John Kelly  \n&gt;  \n&gt;President",

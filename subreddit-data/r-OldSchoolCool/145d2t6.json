But he\u2019s explaining to the reporter in his calm, normal and almost average voice, \u201cI thought it would look good to frame the shot with the nautilus machine in the background at an angle so that we get the gym in the shot. I think that\u2019s the best composition. Then I\u2019ll stand at an angle to camera in the light from this window\u2026\u201d\n\nThe reporter says, \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll be cool\u2026\u201d\n\nMacho turns to me: \u201cHow\u2019s the mic level?\u2026\u201d\n\nI say, \u201clooks good, you\u2019re not peaking\u2026\u201d\n\nHe says, \u201cI\u2019ll be getting pretty loud so you might want to pot the level down quite a bit on channel two\u2026\u201d\n\nI do that, lowering the level on audio channel two.\n\nI turn on the camera and indicate we\u2019re rolling and then the normal guy disappears and Macho Man Randy Savage- the legendary wrestler explodes out of this guy\u2019s face..  it was amazing to watch. From zero to hero in a split second\u2026\n\nAmazing\u2026.",

Part of me, knowing what I know now, thinks yeah, those dudes were kings in the 80s and they missed all the bullshit we're going through now. They experienced life before social media and smart phones and lived the majority of their life in a pre 9/11 America. The rest of me  thinks about how much longer they could have had to enjoy their lives, how they left loved ones behind, and how sad that is. Swear to god I'd have to flip a coin if the option were somehow given to me.",

Some others as well. Fucking Macho Man starts walking up, I had a poster I made with his name in front of me, super excited to say hi to my favorite wrestler and get his autograph. He somehow weaseled past most of the others who were talking with other wrestlers, and I was right there and said \u201cI\u2019m your biggest fan, can I have your autograph?\u201d And to this day I can still hear him say, in a total not Macho Man voice, \u201cNot right now, little man.\u201d and walk right past me into the doorway and leave.

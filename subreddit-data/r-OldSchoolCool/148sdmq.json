Way more common.  Probably lots of regional differences I'm sure, but in over a decade in circles from teenager to throughout my 20s I only really heard people pretty casually into it or new (and usually women) say toned.\n\nMuscular does seem to imply like a serious athlete or bodybuilder or something, dunno why\n\nNothing wrong with the term, not being a weird gatekeepers or something. Just my take on it. Just pontificating over semantic shit but hey it's reddit.\n\nBut surely they existed right? I went to highschool with a guy that never touched a weight in his life. Just played sports, split some firewood and he was *muscular* . That guy was in no way \"fit\" or \"toned\". In grade 11 he actually was like the cartoony buff, super lean dudes. Traps bulging up his shirt, big biceps, tree trunk legs etc. We finally convinced him to start lifting in grade 12 and then he really blew up. Then he went to uni and drank a ton and got fat. Saw him 2 years later, ripped again. It really was something. So I'm sure those people with crazy genetics were always around naturally! Especially if they had a tough labour job and at least OK nutrition. Lucky bastards.",

That high price tag also comes from people consuming way more staples like beans and vegetables and less fattening high calorie luxuries like meat, sugar and butter. Most people weren't fat, because they couldn't afford to be.\n\nToday, I'd be surprised if the average person spends even a quarter of their income on food, and we eat a much higher proportion of fattening foods. The kinds most people back then couldn't afford. Desserts were huge luxuries saved for special occasions, today we can have them as an afterthought. \n\nA rich person could easily chow down on plentiful desserts, meat and fatty buttery foods.  For most of history, obesity was far from uncommon among the wealthy.\n\nMost fat people if transported to the late 19th century and given a stack of money, would have little trouble chowing down on rich fatty foods.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong I would like to lose 30lb I was always pretty slim and fit up to about 37-38 but I\u2019m turning 40 this year and it does get progressively harder to enjoy good food and stay fit. I can still hike up a mountain or jump off a waterfall and if it comes to choosing between doing what I want and eating what I want I guess I\u2019ll choose doing what I want. Although it\u2019s working for me for now and my wife still thinks I look good so I don\u2019t need to impress anyone on the internet.",

One year I got into boxing circuit training + occasional sparring. Great cardio, learned how to throw a punch. I also got down to 165 lbs, so at least five pounds over my \u2018optimal\u2019 weight. Friends and family became very concerned about my appearance, with some even speculating that I had cancer or some other wasting disease. I was fit, but when wearing normal street clothes, I looked downright gaunt and, just, not good.

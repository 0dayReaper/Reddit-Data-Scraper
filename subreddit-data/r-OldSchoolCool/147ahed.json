Jesus Christ. Sober up people. \n\nThey look to me like they are in their 20s, and no one would think twice if that was made clear by\n OP. So until OP makes it clear that they are actually children, people can keep the hysterics to themselves. \n\nCalling people pedophiles, thanks to QAnon, has become a universal antisemitic dog whistle over the past several years, so frankly I think the rest of us are just tired of fucking hearing it.",

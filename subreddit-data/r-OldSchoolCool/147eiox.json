            "comment": "Before the whole reddit goes dark, I\u2019d like to share a story of my Great Grandfather with all of you. AMA, I\u2019ll try to answer\n\nHe was drafted into the Red Army in 1941, sent to defend Kiev immediately. After the fall of Kiev, he was thrown hundred kilometers west of Moscow, where around 2.5 million men were fighting.\nIn 1942, before the start of German offensive, he was sent to Eastern Ukraine, from where he would retreat all the way to Stalingrad once the offensive begins. Battle of Stalingrad would be the bloodiest and biggest battle in history of mankind, and our Great Grandfather was declared dead fighting for the city, on December 3rd, 1942. After the War his name was written on Mamayev Kurgan, the monument to all the fallen soldiers in this battle.\n\nBut he actually lived to see his 70 and came back home in 1946. Soviet command probably didn't find him after the battle, so they assumed he died and just wrote the date as random.\n\nAfter the Battle of Stalingrad, he was moved to Leningrad, where, being part of 18th rifle division, he lifted the Siege. After that, he fought in Finland, even though he was from Southern Kazakhstan, where snow falls only for a week in years. He fought for Petrazavodsk and even entered modern FInland borders. Towards the end of the war, he found himself fighting in Poland, liberating the port of Gdansk. He probably visited Berlin and came back home, to Nukus, Uzbekistan, in 1946.\n\nMy mom, born 4 years before his death remembers him as the calmest person on earth, never cursing, and eating only small portions of food, saying it's enough for him. He drank only 1 cup every year on May 9th, for his fallen comrades.\n\nRest in Peace.",

I thought I was gonna start hallucinating, and like gain a new perspective for a while or something. But, nah, just sleepy, hungry, and into whatever game i happened to be playing\n\nSo, yeah, that's why we need to legalize magic mushrooms and maybe LSD now too",

It was movies that showed illicit drug use with parents that made me want to do naughty things. The bedroom pot smoking scene from Poltergeist. I was 8 years old dying laughing from Cheech and Chong cassette tapes. I didn't understand half the jokes but I knew I wanted to do it. This commercial made me think about it 100%, and the commercial is wrong. I love my pot, mushrooms and tequila and my teenagers know it. Neither one of them has any desire... Yet. I've been open with them since they were able to have the conversation. I do not partake in front of them but they certainly know I enjoy drugs.  My 17 yr old son is super straight edge and heading to pre-med. I will probably be getting high with my daughter in the next few days... She's an artist like me.  I will never talk about it unless she brings it up but I have a sneaking suspicion as she gets a little bit more mature she's going to want to decompress like I do. I love weed and they know it. I think that alone will discourage them since I am a 'boomer' and not cool at all... Of course.",

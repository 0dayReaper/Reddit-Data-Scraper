Some kids were playing with balloons so I wanted to play too. I picked one up and realized that I could feel the bass of the music much better through my fingers holding the balloon. It gave me a strong enough and clearly discernible beat to shuffle side to side with. \n\nNow that I\u2019m older one of my highly musically inclined friends tells me I dance to the half-beat and I wonder if it is because of the way I leaned to  sense a beat.",

Because those frequencies aren't really used for day to day life, and you have your whole body to sense those.\n\nHowever damage to the parts that human voice uses are far more serious, because you'll start to become incapable of understanding other people talking, even though you can still 'hear' in general.\n\n\nSo yes the physical parts can still get damaged, but it doesn't really matter, cause they can't be used anyway.\n\nJust like a person with fully destroyed optical nerves can still burn their retina with a laser, or lose their eyes to am accident. It just won't matter because even when those parts were functional, they could see anyway.",

Both my parents verbalize\u2014and I can\u2019t remember what I worked on in speech therapy but I suspect I may have picked up on some of my parents speech patterns. \n\nFun fact: I live in the south. My accent is extremely mild because my parents don\u2019t have southern accents at all even though they were both raised in the south. I\u2019ve had numerous southerners ask me where I\u2019m from since they don\u2019t hear my accent.",

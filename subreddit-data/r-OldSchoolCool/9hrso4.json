He spoke to my father the same way he spoke on his show.  This confused me.  It didn\u2019t make sense to me that he\u2019d speak to other adults like that.\n\nI asked him, \u201cWhy do you talk strange?\u201d\nHe said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWhy do you talk slow and funny.\u201d\nWithout missing a beat, he smiled warmly, and told me, \u201cEverybody is special in their own way.  I speak like this because that\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d\n\nI imagine that he was used to many adults and some kids occasionally being unnerved by him.  He took genuine interest in my questions.  It was important to him for me to understand that being different was a wonderful thing.\n\nHe opened a metal briefcase that he carried, and took out 3 of his puppets: King Friday, Henrietta Pussycat, and Lady Elaine Fairchilde.  He performed and did all the voices for me.  This amazed me because I never realized that he did their voices before.  He told me that he made the puppets himself.  He answered all my questions with the puppets in character.  \n\nHe took time from his work by delaying his interview, and taught me about being special, with a performance just for me.\n\nThen he asked me if **I wanted to play with them, myself**.  I was dumbfounded.  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  The puppets seemed so important.  They themselves were tv celebrities.  How could he trust me with them?  They were important things... important to the entire world.\n \nHe gave them to me, and allowed me to go into my room to play with them for hours while he finished the interview with my father.\n\nHe made me feel as special and important as the puppets were.  He made me feel valuable.",

I had picked a lull in between breakdowns where I felt I was strong enough to at least go in to the building, sit down and pray that no one terrible talked to me.\n\nThe second I walked in I was almost smacked in the face with the sight of her coffin. It was like right by the front door.  I ran to the bathroom to try to compose myself.  I didn't know how the hell I was going to get through it.\n\nWhen I looked up into the mirror this bright orange thing beside me caught my eye.  There was a rack of pamphlets on the wall.  This bright orange pamphlet that was something like \"talking about death with Mr. Rogers.\" \n\nI flipped through it a bit and took it out with me to the service.  Every time I would start to feel overwhelmed, I would look at the picture of Mr. Rogers on the cover.\n\nNo modern television personality can hold a candle to Mr Rogers.",

He felt it would distract from the message of accepting people of different races (the man is black as well), but I don't recall if anyone knows what his views personally were on the subject.\n\nAs is shown in the documentary, Mr. Rogers eventually came to accept him for who he is and there was even a song he sang on the show with the man that basically said, \"I love you just the way you are.\" It was actually a really touching part of the documentary and I fought back tears while watching on a plane flight.",

He wears a red sweater, rides the trolley, and helps neighbors. It's strange because it's actually the only show for kids that addresses emotional intelligence rather than focusing on shapes/numbers/etc or just mindless cartoon drivel. So that means that 50 years after his debut we still haven't really caught up to the idea. There's just him and his successor in the arena of teaching kids how to handle frustration and be compassionate. It's one of my kids favorite shows and there are actual instances where we are in a situation and we remember a little Daniel tiger song to navigate through it. So the show is actually helping me as a parent. I cant say how much that says about a TV show, especially when compared to paw patrol or some other cartoon with no purpose. ",

She would brag about spending time with the Stones and the Beatles. We always thought she was telling tall tales. Uncovered this pic cleaning out her house last week.",

We were just at the right place at the right time\" stuff like that. He thinks they wrote good music, but he also thinks a lot of other people at the same time were to, and the Beatles just took off and sucked all the air out of the room. If you watch that Ron Howard documentary about their touring, the reporters talk about how bad the Beatles felt for their opening acts, because the kids didn't even listen to them, they just shouted over them until the Beatles came on. So the whole band would hang out with their opening acts on the buss apologizing for how dumb and unfair it all was. ",

They babysat Liv Tyler for years as they were Bebe and Tod Rundgren\u2019s neighbors in Maine. They were pretty close and Bebe still keeps one of my moms paintings in her home. The stories they tell of those days are insane, they refused to tell me them until I was 20 lol.",

I watched him play drums before the Yardbirds came out and blew our minds, and got to know the photographer, who turned out to be Linda Eastman.\n\nWe never know as kids who either we, or our friends will become.  There are many more people I knew in high school and college who later became rather famous.",

Admittedly, he would drop a ludicrous amount of acid, even by 60's rock star standards, and would try, and fail, to play gigs while fried out of his mind. They didn't even kick him out because he was a dick, he just couldn't perform while tripping and it just so happens that he would trip every day. Addiction would be a weird thing to assume about LSD consumption, so my educated guess from my experiences with the drug is that Syd found a place where he felt saner, which ironically accentuated his illness. \n\nPink Floyd kicked out Syd Barrett so that he could get help without being pressured to perform, which he eventually did but the damage had been done by then and he never was the same. One of the saddest story in music history if you ask me, especially with the cultural impact of Wish You Were Here.",

No, he didn't write their hits, but he did write to the paper when they got a bad review; no, he didn't \"get\" the musical artistry Jagger/Richards were blossoming into, but he did push the band to vary its instrumentation and production techniques to keep up with the speedy development of 60s rock. This experimentation gave us 'Paint It, Black' but also gave us *Their Satanic Majesties Request* which is... not great. But it did set the stage for *Beggars Banquet*, perhaps the biggest comeback album of the decade (which is saying something considering it was the 60s).",

Jones also did not get along with the band's manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, who pushed the band into a musical direction at odds with Jones's blues background. At the same time, Jones developed a drug problem, and his performance in the studio became increasingly unreliable, leading to a diminished role within the band he founded. The Rolling Stones asked Jones to leave in June 1969 and guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group. Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his home while under the influence of drugs\n(Wikipediea)",

I\u2019ve seen them live twice and both times he\u2019s been destroyed on stage (although it didn\u2019t affect the shows!) - he\u2019ll stagger off for a drink, then come back on and launch straight into a song.

I reckon all his drinking means his body now just oxidises the alcohol straight to aldehyde perfectly preserving his body for science ;-)",

One day I walked outside to smoke a cigarette and Larry was talking to someone on the phone about a house in Jamica. When he got off the phone I asked him what that was about and he said it was Keith Richards asking him to go check on his house in Jamica. I was like yup whatever dude. He was an old weirdo so I though maybe he was senile. \n\nWell as it turned out one day larry brought a photo album to the office and sure enough there were pictures with him back stage with keith, jerry lee lewis, david bowie yada yada yada. He used to tell us all kinds of stories of partying with Rockstars and even said he slept with Daryl Hannah once. His explanation was everybody was fucking everybody back then man. He casually told me over lunch that he had murdered somebody once and buried them in the desert. It was fuckign crazy the shit that would come out of his mouth. (Come to think of it he reminds me of Del Preston from Waynes World 2)\n\nI never figured out what all that was about or how he was connected like that until I got locked up 10 years later. My girlfriend sent me the keith richards bio. It was crazy seeing Larry's fucking name in Keith Richards autobiography. Apparently Larry is the son of Freddie Sessler who was a very good friend of Richard. Matter of fact when Keiths ex wife/girl shot some kid in Europe Larry was the person Keith sent to sort that mess out. \n\nAnyway it was just a cool experience to spend time so casually with someone who was a part of rockstar lore. Last I heard Larry had since passed .",

He had one of the biggest private Beatles collections, probably in the world, in his attic. He lived in a small bumblefuck town in the middle of nowhere (it was almost like that Simpsons episode where Bart and Milhouse discover Flanders' secret Beatles stash). Local news wanted to cover his collection but he turned them down because he didn't want to attract attention to himself. \n\nI thought a lot of the stories he told me were made up--until he showed me Pete Best's (Beatles drummer before Ringo) personal Christmas cards to him. He sent one to Larry every year. He also had a ~~Liverputian~~Liverpudlian friend who had been active in the Merseybeat scene back in the late-1950s/early-1960s. The friend personally knew the Beatles and ran in their circle and also had a connection to the Small Faces and (although years later) Oasis. I jammed with him with Larry a couple times when I was a teenager...in the basement of this dilapidated music store. In the middle of nowhere USA.\n\nLarry had a lot of crazy stories and cool shit...like talking to Olivia Harrison on the phone after George died or chilling with Julian Lennon at a bar in Minnesota. You'd never know though if you knew him in passing or only saw his house from the outside. ",

She went with her friend, we'll call her Sally, to the concert, and as they get settled in in the vip area, Sally leans in and says \"Oh my god, that's Potsie! I'm going to go talk to him.\" So they walk over and Sally gets Potsie's attention, talks to him for a few seconds before my mom hears Potsie say to Sally \"Hey, does your friend like to party?\" ...Now, my MOM says she did not party with Potsie, but to hear my dad talk, mom liked to party.

He was a respected drummer that actually gave The Beatles a certain credibility and respect when they were starting out. \n\nAmong drummers (and possibly musicians generally) he is highly respected still, but for the general public the drummer is just someone in the background. \n\nIt's hard to imagine a better drummer for the Beatles, someone like John Bonham or Keith Moon or a more technical player wouldn't have had the same feel. Some of his compositions are just sublime and become as much a part of the song as the other instruments (Ticket to Ride and Come Together stand out). He knew when to not overplay, which is something many drummers struggle with.\n\nYou also have to look at context, rock drumming barely existed at the time and he pioneered aspects of playing and recording that we would take for granted today.",

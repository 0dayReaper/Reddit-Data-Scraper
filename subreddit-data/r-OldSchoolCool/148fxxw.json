I\u2019ve posted them before on an old, deleted account. I will repost them soon.\n\nThey are also Cape Verdeans but they have been in the US for about four generations before my mom. Her dad side all immigrated here. My mom also has a GreatGreat-Grandpa who was full Portuguese, and overall, my mom\u2019s maternal side is of a more predominate European descent compared to her dad\u2019s side.",

Since I've finished college, I always enter my Jazz listening phase around this time of year, and I think you might be the one who just triggered it again. First it was Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. A couple years ago during my Jazz phase was Thelonious Monk. Last year it was Jobim and to a lesser degree Gilberto. I wouldn't mind sinking my teeth into something a little more wild this year. Man, Jazz really gets me ready to face the year ahead, it's like brain decompression.",

OP\u2019s grandfather (Maurice Davis) is, arguably, much closer in legacy to Miles than the average trumpet player\u2014and frankly, even amongst active professional trumpeters, making their living off of their talent. Personally, I think it\u2019s still an awesome thing to \u201cspeak\u201d to a direct descendent of Maurice Davis, even if it\u2019s not exactly the same as if we were discussing the other M. Davis, who happened to have been most famed for their trumpet prowess.\n\nETA: By the way, sorry if I\u2019m coming off as chastising you or seeming like I\u2019m somehow disappointed in you. That\u2019s totally not my sentiment, at all, and I mean what I say in only the friendliest of ways. I fear my tone comes off unkindly. In reality, I got nothing but love and respect for ya.",

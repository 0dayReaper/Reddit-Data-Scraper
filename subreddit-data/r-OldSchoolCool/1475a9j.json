You have a mullet, a stache, and a tucked in shirt and you probably look 45 years old.\n\nBallmer, in this case, I cannot explain.  Guy looks the same.",

But they are still into kid stuff.\n\nWhen we were their age we were simpler but we were into grown-up stuff.\n\nI think this changes subtle things like voice and microexpression.",

I ordered it for him and told the waitress to tell him it was from the table of \"developers developers developers developers\". She looked at me like I was crazy and asked who he was so I explained.\n\nShe gave him the drink and he gave a hearty laugh. I guess we stood out like a sore thumb because he knew exactly what table it came from.\n\nHe came by later and introduced himself. He seemed pretty chill personally. I believe this was after he stepped down from Microsoft if I'm remembering correctly, and maybe he chilled out by those days.",

He screwed the pooch when he mocked the then brand new touch screen technology for phones and doubled down on physical keyboard.  He dragged his feet on modernizing the Windows phone operating system which allowed both Apple and Google to create an insurmountable head start. By the time Microsoft came out with a modern (and arguably good) Windows phone and operating system it was too late.  \n\nDuring the 90\u2019s and early aughts Microsoft was in the perfect position to dominate the tech industry, but this visionless duffuss f*ed it up big time. \nI have no idea why Bill Gates and the board of Microsoft thought it was a good idea to make him CEO.",

Obviously, nuclear war never spread beyond Japan, and certainly not to Nebraska, so for the vast majority of the time, these lines went unused.\n\n&gt;A whole bunch of mail order companies set up call centers there, because it was one of the few places you could actually go and order a whole bunch of lines for a business.\n\n&gt;However, owing to a Bell rule, you couldn't use a 800 number for out-of-state calls AND in-state calls. So the companies had two choices - either set up two numbers, one for the 98% of the US who were calling out-of-state, and 1 for the locals... or simply point out (as required by advertising law) that a particular offer wasn't available in Nebraska. Many did the latter, and the meme stuck, to the extent that Ballmer used it as a joke.",

There wasn\u2019t necessarily casual wear like there is today, and you certainly didn\u2019t wear it in public. There was work wear for those with physically demanding jobs, of course, but even jeans and the like were made much better. Let\u2019s face it, the casual style of today, while comfortable, doesn\u2019t look nearly as nice and put together as the more dressed up style of the 50\u2019s.\n\nAnd then you have that clothes in general were made to fit and often altered to fit the individual, versus just throwing on something mass produced that fits well enough at the store. There were still plenty of people that made their own clothing as well. \n\nI\u2019m also of the opinion that black and white photos are just more flattering. You see more details. Sometimes those details get lost in colored pictures. \n\nSo, while people weren\u2019t better looking, it\u2019s just that the era was more... stylized. \n\n",

As things are often mass produced, this may mean working with a seamstress or tailor to get things altered to fit your body, but the results are often worth it. Unfortunately, most of us don\u2019t have the time or resources to go this route. So, instead of doing this to your every day clothing, just key pieces would be worth it. Suits, dresses, etc. \n\nAlso, while this may generate some negativity, there\u2019s something to be said about dressing for your body type. Not every trend and style is going to look good on every figure. So, focus less on trends and more on what\u2019s flattering to your body type. If you go this route, your wardrobe will be more versatile and outlast trends anyway. \n\nAlso, nothing says more than simply being clean and tidy. Clean skin, clean clothing free of wrinkles, tidy hair, etc. \nThis doesn\u2019t mean doing a full face of makeup or spending hours on your hair or anything like that, it just means putting in a few minutes a day to take care of yourself. You\u2019d be amazed at what taking a few minutes simply to freshen up your hair or steam out a few wrinkles can do. Not only for your appearance, but your self esteem as well. When you look good, you *do* feel good. And nothing is sexier than confidence.",

Or measure some clothes that are flattering and fit you \"perfectly\" and never deviate from those measurements unless the obv happens and you gain/lose weight. \n\nBefore price comes how well the clothes were constructed. I rarely shop at mall/local stores as things are so overpriced and not a great ROI in my opinion. So if I know my exact measurements I find great deals online on great quality clothes/shoes and pay ~ 1/2 the price of that hyper-inflated crap. \n\nEDIT:\nThen have a solid tailor to go to only when necessary, but usually if you are doing more than just getting pants hemmed, sleeves length altered, and maybe some darts put in your shirts, whatever you bought wasn't really a great fit to begin with.

He was everything to me and lived one of the most storied lives I've ever heard. He worked until he was 92 as a security guard and decided to retire (for the second time) because he wanted to spend more time with his girlfriend, 10 years his junior.\n\nWhile he was in the hospital his last 2 months of his life, where hit after hit kept coming, he always kept his spirits high and did everything he could to get out of there. It was just his time, sadly, but if he were not ill he could have lived another 20 years. I spent many days at the hospital with him and we had some of the best conversations ever.\n\nI didn't mean to make this about me, but your good-looking grandfather's picture stirred up quite a bit for me. Stop reading this thread and GO HANG OUT WITH HIM. Take him to some bar so he can hit on some lady -- clearly with a mug like that he's done it before! ;)",

Soon, we were on to Jabba's barge scene and there I was, my little 5 year old self, watching Leia jumping all around Jabba's barge. I remember it like it was yesterday.

And I can remember the exact moment my \"tween\" years came to a definitive end. I was barely 12 and I was in the local mall with some of my friends. We were sitting on a bench and watched a group of girls about our age go walking past. And we all watched and let our eyes follow them. One in particular my eyes landed on and took in her shape and her eyes. That was it. Looked at girls differently from that point forward.",

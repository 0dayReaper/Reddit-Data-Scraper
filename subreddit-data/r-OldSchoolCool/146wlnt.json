He really was an amazing guy just full of stories.  People would listen to him wherever he was.  He\u2019s mentioned in the zagat\u2019s guide in Honolulu as always being at this one hotel bar out there. I think they had a plague installed at the bar for him, and another place had put a brass plaque on his favorite chair when he passed away years ago.  In honor of his memory.",

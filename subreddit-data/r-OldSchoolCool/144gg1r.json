In one scene Stallone asks Sandra Bullock how she learned to fight like that to which she replied, \"Jackie Chan movies\". I wasn't into Chinese kung fu movies, I had no idea who Jackie Chan was. My friend who I was with didn't know either. I shrugged it off. \n\nThen a year or 2 later Rumble in the Bronx is released and its a surprise hit in the US. Then based on the success of that they re-release Police Story 3 as Supercop and its a low key hit too. Middle America now knows who Jackie Chan is and they catch the fever. He's starts popping up on talk shows, TV shows, etc... Hollywood finally calls to put him in some major studio pictures and the rest is history. I think Jackie owes Lieutenant Lenina Huxley for the Demolition Man bump.",

He\u2019s the parody song guy who did Guitarzan and The Streak. He also wrote Everything is Beautiful.",

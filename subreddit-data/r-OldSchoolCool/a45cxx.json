It was not when they first met \u2014 they were already friends and vocally admiring of each other. Einstein was there as Chaplin\u2019s guest. They had some bantering in front of a crowd at the premiere. It wasn\u2019t recorded so any quotes are probably paraphrasings and thus probably refined a bit. Some reports just have it as a Chaplin quip \u2014 Einstein said \u201clook everyone loves you!\u201d And Chaplin said, \u201cthey love me because I don\u2019t talk and they understand me. But they love you because you talk and they don\u2019t understand you!\u201d\n\nBut OP\u2019s variation is included in the memoir of Janus Plesch, a doctor and close friend of Einstein\u2019s.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019m sure that after whatever was said was said, people actually clapped.",

It was always just one quick toast and then he could go on.  One day passing by a costume store, he saw a mask of himself, with his flowing hair.  He said to his driver, say, you've heard me give these awful toasts a hundred times.  Why don't you put on a mask of me and you give the toast as me, and I'll wear your driver's cap.\n\nThey went, and the trick was pretty successful, except for one stubborn fan who insisted on pressing a technical question.\n\nWithout missing a beat, the driver said, \"What an elementary question!  In fact, I'll let my driver answer it...\" and pointed to Einstein in his driver's cap.",

One of the questions was about how much energy was released from a certain chemical reaction. I was scratching my head and had an almost hysteric moment of thinking E=mc^2. So I computed the most mass of the products and the molar mass of the reactants (because at least I had memorized molar mass of the common elements at that point in high school) and wrote down an answer. And it as frikkin right!! That grade got me into my chosen program in college, which got me the opportunity to move to California for my first job after college, where I met my wife. So now there are two children who would never have been born if it weren't for Albert Einstein. This is absolutely a true story.",

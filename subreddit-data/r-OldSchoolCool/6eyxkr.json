They were awesome in that they all had their own unique personalities and habits. They all seemed to collect shiny objects like quarters, jewelry or marbles. They are clever and curious and as others mentioned can figure out how to open doors. I think the problem some people have is they require more attention than a cat and you have to allow them to do things that come natural to them so I'm sure a lot of these people simply weren't prepared or educated well enough to adopt a raccoon.",

Dad concluded he most likely contracted rabies, and so he put him down. Very sad day. We buried him next to the pond in the picture since that was his favorite place to be.  \n\n",

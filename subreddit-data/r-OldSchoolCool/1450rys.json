They had dogs to chase after them and people to  capture them, bring them back and torture them if caught.    She was a  disabled woman.   When she was in her early teens, Tubman was badly  injured when the slave master,  trying to stop the escape attempt of  another enslaved person, threw a  large weight across a room, striking  Tubman in the head. Tubman was  given little medical care or time to  recuperate before she was sent back to the fields. She never recovered  from the damage done to her brain and  skull, suffering periodic  seizures that researchers believed may have  been a form of epilepsy..   She guided 70 people;  enslaved men, women, and children at night from  the south on foot in all weather conditions even having to push them  onward at gun point- if they turned back everyone could die and she  couldn't go back to save others.",

I'm financially trapped here which I guess means I deserve the fact that I've lost my human rights and live in fear due to the hostility and eagerness to harm women around here, but I refuse to silence my voice on these topics. A lot like that people like her are being erased because many racists throughout the country move here for the freedom of hatred that is our reality now and it gets worse and worse by the week. Much of the country have their heads in the sand, happy to say we brought it on ourselves while the country creeps towards taking their freedoms as well but that doesn't fit their narrative of \"we are the good ones so nothing bad will happen to us\". \n\nI understand I'm someone the rest of the country is happy to sacrifice so they can pretend everything is ok but regardless of that I'm a proud Democrat that votes blue and I try to do my part to keep others from facing what was forced on us here. I hope to get out before something terrible happens to me but we shall see. Sorry for the rant lol it's very frustrating",

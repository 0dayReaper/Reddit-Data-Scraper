There had been a lot of rain, so the current was very strong.\n\nOur homemade raft broke apart and we ended up stranded on a small island in the middle of the river.  I think a couple of people drowned that year.\n\nAny idea what year I went?",

The Vietnam War didn\u2019t end until 1975, and the social strife that went along with that persisted through the decade. The amount of air pollution and trash and dirty water ways is practically inconceivable to Americans these days.  No fault divorce wasn\u2019t the standard until 1975. It was near impossible for women to get their own credit card until 1974. The amount of overt everyday racism is also impossible for people to really conceive of. Mortgages for people with good credit could be close to double digit percentage towards the end of the decade. Inflation averaged 8% a year and was over 10% for several years. Gas shortages and gas lines kept happening. The downtown core of just about every medium to large city in America had been hollowed out by 20 years of white flight and been left to become almost post apocalyptic from the levels of crime and poverty.\n\nBut people did do a lot of drugs and fucking, in part because of increased access to drugs and birth control.  But also because things kind of sucked and what else were people going to do.\n\n**Edit:** Also the music was fucking lit\n\n**Edit 2:**  But also we were in the middle of the upslope of the crime wave that started in the late 50s and peaked in the early 90s.",

He did it completely on his own. He gently pulled her back into the middle of the yard, she was just old enough to walk. She was swatting at him and yelling gibberish and \u201cNO!\u201d and he just ignored her and pulled her away from the cars parked in the driveway. We were watching him and weren\u2019t positive what he was doing for sure until she got up and went toward the cars again and he got up and did the same thing. She was swatting at him again and by this time we were laughing our butts off. We were in lawn chairs and no one was even thinking about getting in a car but he didn\u2019t know that. He just knew cars were dangerous and she shouldn\u2019t go near them. \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc4d",

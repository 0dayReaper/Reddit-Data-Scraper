    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This self portrait was used as a cover for the Scorpions album \\\\\"Blackout\\\\\" published in 1982. Helnwein is an austrian-irish artist famous for his hyper-realistic painting style. His work mainly circles around the themes of pain, injury and violence, touching on taboos and topics of recent history - in particular, the subject of National Socialism. At the centre of his work, however, lies the depiction of the wounded child.](https://preview.redd.it/onlprqv1du5b1.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=02d50abfb140d6ac1f074d31e95f93bb8a253953)",

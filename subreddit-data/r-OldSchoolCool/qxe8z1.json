After the unification, the Federal Republic deported over 2/3rds of the non-Germans living in East Germany back to their countries of origin. \n\nThe best known examples of Afro-East Germans are probably Karamba Diaby (a social democrat politician who is currently a member of the Bundestag/parliament - he also has a PhD in chemistry), Amadeu Antonio Kiowa (who was murdered by a Neonazi mob in 1990 in one of the most infamous post-unification cases - the perpetrators, who had banded together with the intention of assaulting \"n**er\", were only charged with assault, also there were twenty-three on-duty police officers nearby who did not intervene to help him, none of those were ever convicted) and a community of a few hundred Namibian children who were raised in East Germany and deported back in 1990 as they still have a quite active community in Namibia and many of them speak \"Oshi-Deutsch\", a mixture of German and Oshivambo.\n\nJust saying this because people often conflate \"Germany\" with \"West Germany\" lol\n\nEDIT: Also another fun Black East Germany fact is that MLK is the only person known to be permitted to pass the Berlin Wall without a passport. In 1964, he visited West Berlin. Because the US authorities were suspicious of him (and the socialist ties of the Black civil rights movement and the Eastern Bloc - Angela Davis would later receive asylum in East Germany for example), they confiscated his passport to make it impossible for him to cross the border. He went there anyway and after a few moments of confusion, the East German border guards let him cross after he showed them his American Express card instead. He held a sermon in a church in East Berlin (in which he criticised the wall) and then crossed back into West Berlin.",

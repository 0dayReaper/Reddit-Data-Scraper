I'm incredibly loyal and dedicated and it took me a long time to break the Forever Love link to him in my brain and heart.

But now I'm five years into a relationship which is SO much better, happier and healthier. And your ex cheated so actually the bar is pretty low for finding someone better :) ",

I have a whole lot of love to give, I just have to figure out how to know when it's really the right person. He didn't just break my trust in him, he broke my ability to trust *myself* to choose who to let into my life.\n\nAnyway.. I'm getting there. I'm sure the right person will come along when the time is right. And if not, I've been doing just fine on my own. I would appreciate having someone to share laughs and love and life with, but I don't *need* it. I've come into my own in that regard at least. :)",

The only changes they've made have been occasionally moving to updated models - they recently went from the C110 to the more modern NBC110, basically a modernized C110 made custom for Australia post by Honda.",

Even some NBC110s, but they're much less common to see in the classifieds. You can do it, man! Your dream project bike is already out there somewhere, just waiting for you to find it.",

They do have CT-designation bikes that aren't Cubs, but the bikes used by posties is definitely a variant of the Cub Line. You can tell, because they also have a hard time winning the world series.\n\nAs for the latest/current model, the NBC110, it's basically just a custom-built-to-order Super Cub. It depends where you want to draw the divide between cub/not cub, I guess.\n\n&gt;I also think they are going electric soon.\n\nI can't say for sure. They will be releasing the Electric cub in Australia this year, apparently, and Auspost has been keen on the idea. Assuming it passes trials, I'd expect their next big bike update to be a switch to electric. Which is good news for people who have been wanting one of those NBC110s.",

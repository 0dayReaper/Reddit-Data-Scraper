I am very upset about the Trump election but you know what Trump isn't going to pay my bills, fix the schools in my community, clean up parks, make public transportation more viable etc. Bernie didn't win but we can still learn from him.

Journalists saw that their role in society was to show people what they couldn't otherwise see. \n\nNow, they (and by they, I mean the executives, the producers, the money men) have realized, quite correctly, that there is more profit to be made in telling people what they want to hear, and what they already know.

Anyone that follows him would know he was probably the 2nd healthiest candidate in the race except for Martin O'Malley. He was far, far, far healthier than Clinton despite being 10% older than her.  He was doing 1-3 rallies a day, 4-6 days per week. Speaking and on his feet what seems like at least 30 hours a week, plus all his time traveling around. He never had a sick day.\n\nI'm a millennial, not overweight, and he's healthier than me..\n\nI'd vote for him in 4 years, but it'd probably work better if he campaigned for someone else that champions his same values like Tulsi Gabbard (who could be our youngest president, first female president, and the best president of the past 50 years all in one package in 2020).",

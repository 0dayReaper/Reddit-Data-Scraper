            "comment": "Story to share - Metallica came to my home and hung out at a party\n\nI lived in Oakland, California when Metallica was first starting out \u2026.. in those days the band was not well liked (by the local clubs) and had problems getting gigs. (locally in the music scene this was pretty common knowledge\n- They did have a fiercely strong following and many fans protested resulting in the group getting gigs\nOne of the clubs that they played at during that era was called the OMNI\nIt was a divey hole of a club\u2026.\n\nI was living up in the hills, an Old Tunnel Road, sharing a house with a guy in his late 20s, whose parents had cosigned to get him the rental - he was also the son of a police chief, which I\u2019m sure helped\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that this kid was a mega Tweaker\u2026. \n\nOne night after Metallica played at the OMNI, he decided to invite the entire club up to our house to continue the party \u2026. At 2:30 in the morning.\nThe band came along also!\n\nWhen they arrived at the house, I was sound asleep because I had to work early the next morning\nI was not pleased to hear them, playing loud metal music at full blast, and full party mode\n\nWhen I came out into the living room, the four members of the band were standing in a corner watching everyone\n\nAs a protest, I put on what was the brand new Spinal Tap album, at full volume!\nThe people who were dancing, never even noticed that the music had changed and just kept dancing \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe band recognized the music and started snickering and laughing\n- when they heard me asking a few party goers if they hadn\u2019t noticed the music had changed, and a parody record was now playing\u2026. The comicallyoblivious answer I got was.: oh cool \u2026 put on some Guns and Roses \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe band members were really laughing at that point\n\n- hope you enjoyed the short. \u201c brush with fame\u201d story.",

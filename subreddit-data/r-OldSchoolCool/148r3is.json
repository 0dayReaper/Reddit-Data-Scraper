All the chemicals required to process Kodachrome as a colour slide are now unavailable commercially, but, even if they were, without the requisite equipment K14 processing would still be impossible on a commercial level. Any new slides / films found after 2011 unfortunately can only be processed in black and white.",

            "comment": "With Kodachrome your camera took a black and white image. At the lab it was transferred to a different film stock and the color was added in the lab. That is why the color images last for decades - the dyes were much more stable than that of the other \"chrome\" films. The idea of using black and white is how NASA sends the images from Mars back to Earth, they have a test pattern on the leg of lander to calibrate adding the colors to the finished images released to the public.",

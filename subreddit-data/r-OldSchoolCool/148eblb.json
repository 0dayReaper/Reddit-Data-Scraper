She was opposed to spending so much on 1 card and wanted me to buy a couple UD packs instead but ultimately gave in and bought it for me. I had it graded by PSA about 3 years ago and it came back a PSA 9 so worth about $250 or so. 9.5% ROI across 34 years. Thanks for splurging Gram, I love and miss you so much!",

All of the best memories in my life are from my grandmother/grandfather. From making Jell-O with her to have for dessert after dinner, going to the community pool and swimming while she sat on a chair  reading her book, eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at the park after swinging, and renting $2.99 Nintendo games at blockbuster video on Fridays to play all weekend. All of that stuff cost next to nothing, spend time with your kids and take lots of pictures playing with them.

I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any (non-photographic) evidence for it though. \n\nI loved watching him hit but I hated Bonds as a result of his in-denial fans (including some media apologists). But even then this is the narrative I used, along with pics from 97-98-99-00-01 to show how obvious it was even apart from the statistics. \n\nHowever now that I\u2019m emotionally removed from it all I can see that Barry was twice the player of McGwire or Sosa and I\u2019m totally sympathetic to why he started using. It wasn\u2019t even about getting an edge by that point, it was just about competing at your appropriate level. At least that\u2019s how I believe it started.",

Plus only counting their first 7 years(the years bonds was a pirate) he had 2 mvps Griffey had none. Bonds also went 30/30 2x. Griffey never had more than 25. I\u2019m not hating on Griffey, dude is a legend. But bonds was all time great.",

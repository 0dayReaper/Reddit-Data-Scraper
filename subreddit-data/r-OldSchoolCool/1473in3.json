    "postText": "Richard Belzer (host of the show *Hot Properties* at the time) and Hulk Hogan (along with a not pictured Mr. T) in 1985 who were there live promoting their upcoming WWF WrestleMania I tag team match. Belzer requested some wrestling demonstrations including having Hogan putting Belzer in a hold. Hogan initially denied but Belzer persisted which lead to Hogan placing him in a front chin lock that caused Belzer to pass out. Belzer slipped from Hogan\u2019s grasp and ended up cracking his head on the floor requiring 9 stitches. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and used the funds to purchase a home for he and his wife, which he dubbed \u201cChez Hogan.\u201d All this to say: don\u2019t try this at home, kids. \n\n[You can watch the incident here. Warning: it is a little upsetting and there is blood.](https://youtu.be/i7n_SHrK408)",

So the Hulkster put Belzer in a guillotine and choked him unconscious in about 7 seconds flat. He then dropped him like a sack of shit and belzers head split open when he hit the floor. \n\nHe sued, he won. It\u2019s on YouTube if you\u2019re interested. Hulk was wrong for doing it but Belzer was asking to get checked. Hulk wasn\u2019t a legit tough guy but he was ya know a foot taller and probably 200 lbs heavier than a geek talk show host",

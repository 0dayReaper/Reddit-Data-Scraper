He was 5 when I was 11. Other than him I hung around kids my own age. But his grandma was our neighbor and he'd spend the summers with her. We'd play baseball in the front yard all summer long. Nicest little dude.\n\nI saw him a few years ago all grown up and it was weird. But the worst part is, it was actually a decade ago. And now he's in his 30's too. It literally feels like 2 or 3 years ago. And I don't like that at all. \n\nI used to make fun of old people for that shit - telling stories that happened \"a few years ago\" and you later find out it happened in the mid 80's. But time is humbling me. I get it now. \n\nEnjoy your 30's. They go **quick**. I'm 38 now and the last 8 years have basically been a blur. I need to start touching grass and trying to slow things down a little bit. Or at least try to keep time from speeding up too quickly.",

The older guys would bring their kids who played their own game since it wouldn\u2019t be fair to put a 7 year against an adult. There was this one kid though, who desperately wanted to play against the adults, counting down the days till the cut off. \n\nHe could throw better than most of us already, and I would always let him play and I\u2019d guard him and make the plays real enough that he didn\u2019t feel patronized. \n\nI leave town for 4 years after college, and when I came back I got married and had a son so there was little time from frisbee. My wife jokes I need to get back in shape or I won\u2019t be able to keep up with our son sprinting around the house.\n\nSo I sign up for a game and right as the game starts a tall college aged kid comes up to me and asks if I was the guy at Sunday Frisbee pickup who always let him play. I realize who he is but my brain full buffer wheels because time passes for me but he\u2019s supposed to still be the little 12 year old not this 20 year old guy who\u2019s 6 inches taller than me. He asks if I\u2019d guard him again, and proceeds to absolutely wreck me on the field with no issue. I\u2019ve never been prouder to get beat so badly.",

Now i'm 27 and it seems like maybe 25 percent of may hair has gone grey/silverish. No sign of a receding hairline though, so at least I have that. Plus honestly people seem to compliment the \"grey fox\" look, but it was always odd to me that it started happening so damn early.",

He was doing magic at Disneyland since like\u2026 right after they opened.\n\nHe\u2019s always been super busy and he has a ton of skills that involve super quick thinking and physical reflexes. Dude\u2019s mind has always been on overdrive.\n\nHe can do magic, juggle, and play the goddamn shit out of a banjo.\n\nHe can be silly as fuck like on SNL, and he can play very realistic super stressed out guy in movies.\n\nMy man has been going hard for half a century. No wonder he went gray so young. Love him.",

They're giving Steve the pretty parts to play\" but it turns out that they were playing The Crow, which Steve wrote.  That was the moment I realized how truly good he is.  \n\nI mean, Steve Martin's version of Eight More Miles to Louisville on the Let's Get Small album was what made me want to learn to play the banjo in the first place.  It's insane, and just an aside to jokes about Richard Nixon.  \n\nI'm with you.  He deserves to be included among the greats.",

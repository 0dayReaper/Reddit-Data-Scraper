                    "comment": "Went in 1989 as my college senior spring break trip.   Left Cincy in my 83 GLX 5.0 convertible that I had just spent a week detailing for this specific trip.  Followed my fellow classmates who were doing 90-100 all the way down in a van with a keg in the back compartment and the tap sticking out visible in the window.  About 10 in the van no joke.  How we didn't get stopped I will never know.  Arrived too early so had to get a room across the A1A not on the beach, which was the best decision we ever made.  Ended up on a balcony facing A1A facing the street yelling \"show us your ...\" to every babe that went by, with many complying.  Huge party that night, I was so tired because we drove straight through after finals and I had not slept in 24 hours that I ended up passing out on the toilet.  Yes, they took a picture and posted it in the food line at my graduation party (500+ with a band) for every person I ever knew, including my old family members, too see.  Next day we moved in to our hotel on the beach.\n\nThey named the trip the \"Hog Scrog\"--first to win it gets free room charge.  I let you imagine what the competition was LOL.  A guy desperate for money won, and we all witnessed it from afar on the beach.  Our room was right next to the Texan where MTV was broadcasting, including the famous belly flop contest.  Incredible.  There were these girls from Michigan State that saw us bonging beers on the balcony so they decided to pay us a visit.  One in particular, the most gorgeous of them all, took a full pitcher in one bong and acted like nothing happened.  She then started talking to the other guys about coming over and eventually mentioned she was not talking about them but pointed at ME even though I never said a word to her.  I was a wet noodle I don't even remember what I said to her when I went over and talked to her.  She did invite me up for later but when I went to find them they were nowhere to be found.  We drove my near perfect Mustang (white, red interior, 5 speed, leather, great aftermarket stereo system and speakers) right on to the beach and parked.  Glorious.  That weekend they announced it as the largest crowd in Daytona Beach history.  There were Playboy bunnies in convertible GT's riding down the beach advertising a promo at the convention center which had been turned in to a bar because of so many people you couldn't get in to a regular club.  I still have an autographed picture of one she was giving out for free.  At one point we decided to have a room party.  BIG mistake.  So we had to get alcohol--you know the usual white stuff--to make hooch.  We needed a lot to fill a giant cooler we had with the kool-aid and fruit.  So I decided to take my friends to the liquor store, had more than a few in me.  We backed out of the parking space in to the alley and I decided to light the tires up.  Easy to do with the 5.0 and my 5 speed with power braking.  Well....there was a rent a cop right there.  Instant pull over.  I was very nice and somehow managed to talk him out of it by apologizing and letting my buddy drive.  Whew!  Everyone booed from the other balconies when he let me go!  We got back and made the hooch and let  the doors open.  Everyone and their mother apparently heard about it (found out later it was the inland locals that freeload like this every weekend), and our hooch was GONE in about an hour.  That was supposed to last for a few days because it was hundreds of dollars in liquor.  Me and another classmate, I guess you could consider us the more gentlemanly ones, did manage to hang around with two girls, whose family just happened to own the hotel we were staying in.  We called them our \"Georgia Peaches\" as that is where they were from.  It was like dating but not.  Got their numbers but never heard from them again after the trip.  The rest of the trip was just a blur.  Very fun, though.  As we were leaving that Saturday, they announced another record crowd for Daytona for that weekend.  I believe the next year is when they really cracked down because I think I remember someone had fell off a balcony and died while we were there.  Because of this, I think to this day that record has still never been broken.",

When we think obesity we normally picture someone so fat they can barely walk, but that's more like morbid obesity. Most obese people we would only consider \"fat\" and most fat people we'd say are a healthy weight. And people who are actually at a healthy weight are often seen as *under*weight.",

Turned out to be an MTV event, but when we tried to get close some huge guy with a 3\u2019 lump of 2x2 started to walk towards us so we turned and ran away. There was also coke and weed everywhere, parties in nearly every motel room.

(You can't see the live axle in the picture due to the angle, but I'm pretty sure it's there).\n\nAnd it makes sense to set them up that way rather than having each engine independently power its own rear wheel because if there was a significant difference in power output from one engine to the other (since they're both controlled by the same throttle cable so they can't be adjusted individually on-the-fly) the kart would pull to one side when giving it the beans if the engines were out of \"power balance\" when powering an individual wheel.\n\nThere was a company called McCulloch around this time that built twin engine go-karts like this one and if this isn't a McCulloch kart it looks a whole lot like one.\n\nAs for how it would drive, it would drive just like a kart today that has a single engine and a live rear axle, just with more power thanks to the twin engine setup.  No crazy handling traits even if the engines don't produce the exact same amount of power thanks to both engines powering the same axle.",

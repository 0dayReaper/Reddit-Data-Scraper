I bought my dad a book about submarines for Christmas one year and he\u2019s flipping through and sees a picture of himself standing on the deck of his submarine with a Regulus missile in the early 1960\u2019s. He was shocked. Then, I book him and my mom a B&amp;B for my college graduation and the owner has the commissioning plaque from my dad\u2019s submarine hanging on his wall! My dad was on the commissioning crew in the late 1950\u2019s and this guy was on the decommissioning crew in the mid-1980\u2019s. The B&amp;B owner grabbed that plaque off the wall and shoved it into my fathers arms and said he should have it. Then they drank whisky and talked for hours. ",

Changed my point of view very fast. He didn't even know what PTSD was until he was in his 50s and got arrested and tried for marijuana possession. The judge let him off and told him to go get a green card and treatment for PTSD.\n\nHe was good a lot of the time, but then idk, something would happen to get his adrenaline going and it was over, he would become abusive. Never hit my mom though, he saved that for the kids. One time when I was about 4, he was sleeping in his recliner, and I tweaked his big toe like he did to me. He sat bolt upright and came straight at me with this crazy ass look in his eyes like he didn't see me at all, he was just going to go straight through me, tiny kid. At the last second it was like a light switched on and he just went \"Fuck. Don't touch me when I'm sleeping, babygirl.\"",

I struggle with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, visualizations - much of it centered around \"moral injury\". I've been trying to articulate what it is like for awhile but these two paragraphs that I wrote in the last few weeks capture the spirit of it pretty well, i think.\n&gt; I\u2019ve read books about conflict and war. I\u2019ve watched movies that depict beautifully all of the horrors of combat. Songs have been written about the sacrifice and loss. But I\u2019ve struggled to connect with a medium that really captures the feeling of loss you experience at war \u2013 and not just when a brother is killed \u2013 no, there is more to loss than that. I died over there. I died every time I pulled the trigger and I died every time an IED went off or sniper fired or a child was paid to throw a grenade at our patrol. I died when I kicked on the door of a home in the dark of the night for random searches, rounding up an innocent family filled with women and children. I died when I shot at oncoming vehicles that weren\u2019t slowing down fast enough and I died when I shoved the barrel of my into someone\u2019s chest because they didn\u2019t stop walking fast enough. I died in those streets a thousand times over. At least, the me that existed before the war died, he was lost never to be seen again.\nthis second bit is from a narrative story I'm working on to try and explain what its like in my day to day life.\n&gt; In those first waking moments of the morning, his mind is still hazy \u2013 he\u2019ll absent mindedly reach for a rifle a decade removed, or swing his feet to the floor in an effort to pull his boots on quickly. They\u2019re not there, of course. They sit in the basement, covered in dirt and paint- having since been relegated to use for work around the house. As the grip of sleep slips away, he opens his eyes. His wife lay sleeping. Rolling to his back, he turns his eyes to the ceiling and follows the swirling of the ceiling fan.\n&gt;No nightmares last night- that\u2019s a good start.\n&gt; At 31 years he hurts more than most. His knees ache with the rain and too many stairs sends a shooting pain through his lower back. Like most men in the service, he pushed through the pain far too many times. A decision of which he is reminded nearly every day.\n&gt;Pushing off the mattress, he stumbles to the bathroom to get ready for the day. A hot shower loosens his stiff joints and muscles. He lowers his head into the steady stream of water and his mind drifts off. He is already back in Fallujah. It never takes long for the memories to come. As the room fills with steam he recalls the hot city streets in the Iraqi summer.\n&gt;The stench of raw sewage flowing down the street mingling with kabobs from the nearby market create an odor that has stuck with him through the years. He can feel his boots strike the ground, stepping quickly, deliberately, and confidently. His rifle rests across his chest- finger straight and off the trigger \u2013and his eyes scan rooftops, alleyways, cars, and windows.\n&gt;He turns and knocks a bottle of shampoo to the tub floor and is snapped out of his daydream. Its been 10 minutes since he stepped in the shower.",

What I think a lot of people don\u2019t get is when I tell them that the only thing you have to worry about in war is not dying. Then at some point you start HOPING for the situations that are likely to kill you. You hope for an ambush so you can shot something, a little IED for some adrenaline or a complex attack on the COP to get the juices flowing. Then when you come home you have a thousand things you have to worry about; your relationships are all different from the time apart and because your different, the bills are piling up, you can drink as much as you want after spending 15 months sober. As the shit starts to wear on you, you long for the days where all you had to worry about was dying. In combat you come to grips with the fact that you might die and you pretty much stop caring or thinking about it. I think there is a correlation with that feeling and suicides among veterans. When you\u2019ve already decided it\u2019s not a big deal if you die at a time when that\u2019s the only thing you have to worry about, it\u2019s not hard to make the leap to suicide when you have 99 problems and death ain\u2019t one. Thanks for sharing your experience and I wish you the best. ",

Laying down suppressive fire, close encounters with mortars, helping generals give money to the families of children that we killed. I never got seriously hurt.

Plenty of soldiers had it way worse than I did, yet it all stayed with me still.\n\nIt was that Moral Death. That explains it well. It doesn't make it better but I am glad to finally have a word for it. Thanks for writing. \n\nEdit: turns out the comment ahead of mine was deleted. If it was by the author I just want you to know you should keep writing. It helped me a little bit and I am sure it could help others with PTSD. If it was deleted by someone else... then fuck off.

Booze handed me to my demons on a silver platter so it had to go. I'm angry at everyone, everything, and nothing, always. I hate myself. I hate who I am. I hate the man that looks at me with world weary eyes in the mirror. And even with all the hate, venom, and piss pounding constantly through my veins, I'm undeniably depressed. Everyday is just...going through the motions. I force myself to get up, get dressed, and go to work. I force myself to play nice when I'd rather just scream and rage and cry and hit people. I force myself into some semblance of normal even though on the inside at best I feel horribly, irreparably broken and at worst...I feel dead and hollow, like a man who's waiting on death's door. I just want off this fucking ride. Gods know I've tried. I've been caught. I've done my 72 hour stays. Now I'm too afraid to even do that. So I go through the motions, praying to any and every god that I firmly believe doesn't exist, begging, beseeching, offer deal after deal after deal if they'll just fucking take me. I don't care what the afterlife is, nirvana, heaven, hell, valhalla, I don't care anymore. I just want out. That's PTSD. That's what I live with. It's a never ending ride of bullshit. It lets you come up for air every now and again, just long enough to get a lungful and feel that glorious sunlight on your face, reminds you of all you've given and lost....then it drags you down to the depths again and you never know if this is the time it keeps you, if that was the last time you'd feel the sun. It hurts. It is beyond physical pain. It's beyond mental pain. It hurts your fucking *soul*. I have enemies and I've wished death and pain and torture on them but I'd never wish them this. I'd never wish they be eternal walking wounded, carrying scars that no one else can see, no one else can understand. Jesus fuck, I'm ugly crying in the can at work while I type this. Kids...stay away from war. It's not fucking worth it, okay? Just stay home, stay safe, stay sheltered and don't know this hurt. It's not worth it. Nothing they give you is worth this.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the kind words Reddit. You fine folks are why I keep coming back and partly why I'm still kicking. I won't give up. I don't think it's in me no matter how much I wish I could. I just...I miss normalcy. I miss inner peace and calm and the reservoir of strength and determination I once had to draw from. I wish I could have some time, to work on me and work through this bullshit but unfortunately, life has demands and that's not in the cards for me at present so I'll just keep digging and fighting and pushing and hoping that one day, maybe I can find my way again.",

I'm terrified of what living with me and my PTSD is/has done to them. \n\nOne of the most heartbreaking moments of my life happened when I was getting my youngest daughter ready for bed a while back. She grabbed me by the hand, led me into her room, and showed me a picture of me in my arid camouflage uniform holding her prior to my first deployment. We're both smiling and look happy. She turned to me and said \"I miss this daddy. He was happy and smiled more.\" That broke me. \n\nI put her to bed and balled my eyes out for hours after. \n\nI'm in therapy, on meds, and improving but I feel so guilty at what my family has to live through because of my experiences. I don't think that guilt is ever going to go away\n\n\nEdit: Wow. Reddit can be such an awesome community. I want to thank you for your kind words and support (and the gold).

On the flight to Bangkok we picked up a lot of very young solders from Clark AFB in the Phillipines to Saigon where it was a white-knuckle landing (we were told the nose-dive was for safety). I was so young, but still remember feeling alarmed for these boys just a few years older than myself. Definitely a strange time to be living in Thailand knowing a war was raging 600 miles away. ",

They're emotionally distant while trying their best to still be a parent, but their concept of being a strong person tends to be bottling up emotion and not letting them out. Not healthy for a kid growing up to be that way. There's also studies that suggest parent with anxiety will likely have anxious kids, so socializing is difficult enough as it is then add onto that these screwed up emotional behaviors you have whenever situations get complex and you get some weird ass behavior, mannerisms, and lifestyle. Recognizing those as faults is difficult as well, considering people going through that kind of stuff tend to see them as strengths and are unwilling to allow themselves to open up. It is rough man.

Here's a quote from his email to my mom which I found interesting:\n\n\"Before [my wife] put this trip together, I had mixed feelings about going back to Vietnam (after all, it was my generations \u201cwar\u201d). Even at the time I was there I thought it was a stupid thing we were doing. But it sure made the decision to leave the Navy for the airlines much easier to make. Spending time with the Vietnamese I think helped me deal with the guilt I felt from my participation in that war. So no question, it was very cathartic for me. And I am so glad [my wife] convinced me to make the trip.\"",

                    "comment": "When my dad came home from Vietnam, my mom says he was a very different man than before he left. He became more serious about life. More straight faced, not really smiling as much. More angry than before. He retired from the army after 24 years. After being passed over for advancement a couple of times, it was mandatory. My mom believes it was his mental attitude that handicapped him from advancing. Once retired, he tried to find a few ways to seek out a living from real estate to substitute teacher. He\u2019s a smart, well educated man, but his demeanor is a little off putting. But it wasn\u2019t until 1999, after joining the police force (not as a cop), that his PTSD manifested in the state they we know him now. \n\nOnce employed by the BPD, he reconnected with an old army buddy, a pilot, whom he served with in Vietnam. Unfortunately, that pilot lost his life in a helicopter crash in the city. I see this as the point in which my father lost it. \n\nImagine getting a phone call, from out of state, that your now step-mother\u2019s mother passed away, and you should come to the funeral. I made arrangement, came home, and witnessed for the first time, my dad being...different. He didn\u2019t recognize me. Not because I\u2019ve changed, but because he saw me as one of his soldiers in Vietnam, and thought the tattoo I have on my arm was a wound, and needed medical help. I didn\u2019t know this was happening to him. My step mother never told me. But now I knew. It had been happening for a little while now. She shared with me writings he had been doing. Writings written in the point of view of his younger self, actively flying around Vietnam in helicopters, bring deaths and destruction via Big John, which is his name. It was surreal, and I didn\u2019t know how to handle things. Then she told me about his spending habits (I learned he was bi-polar, and he was very manic), and that there were bags and boxed all over the place of things bought, and never opened. And then, she tells me about the shotgun he has, and that he hid it in the attic, where he once his for a while because he came paranoid. I found the shotgun, emptied it, and gave it to her. My dad was in and out different. After a few days, I don\u2019t remember the specifics, as I was at a friends, he was taken to the vets hospital, and was staying under observation. \n\nThat\u2019s where I had to leave him, getting help, as I had to return home. Things have changed over time, including him and I, and for various reasons, we stopped being close, and don\u2019t really speak anymore. There are numerous things that caused our strained relationship, too many to list here. However, is still my dad, and when I do see home from time to time, I\u2019m glad to see him, but also scared, because he is so different now. \n\nMore recently I had gotten a call from my stepmom in the middle of the night when my dad had another break. He had the shotgun again, claiming someone was coming to get him, and the police had been called by a neighbor. \u201cwhat the hell am I suppose to from here\u201d I thought. So I called the police department, spoke to someone, and explained who and what my dad is. I honestly believe that that call probably saved his life that night. \n\nMost recently, I had to block contact with him. He was writing weird letters to me via Facebook, and they were a little threatening. Hard to describe. I think I still have them saved Incase something had happened. \n\nThat fucking war destroyed my father, ruined a marriage, broke up a family, and disintegrated any hope of having a tight bond with him. I miss him, mostly, but kind of don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard. If you still have loved ones that are dealing with PTSD, from any event, look after them. They need you more than you know. ",

Like have you ever wondered how google maps and Waze (which gets a lot of data from google maps) can tell you when a traffic jam is happening? It's not user input unlike the hazards icons. Google monitors the SPEED of android phones near those roads based on their connectivity to cell towers, and when a lot of android users are slowing down, Google Maps figures out it's a traffic issue. \n\nCrazy, huh?",

The pic takes me back; the noise from the vehicles, the smell of the fuel, the red dirt that gets into your nose and on your skin that you can't scrub away. I lost every pic I had of Viet Nam decades ago and haven't found one pic with me or anyone I knew in the two armor units I was in on line despite years of searching. I was on the cover of Newsweek magazine in 1971 when some photographer took a pic of the M113 I was on and can't find that either. Your dad may not think so, but he's very lucky you found this picture. Good job, man.  ",

I had it professionally printed  out and framed, and gave it to my dad as a Christmas present.  He had never seen it before, and it meant so much to him b/c his father died when my dad was fairly young.\n\nAwesome pic, friend.",

If I remember right, it originally referred to hanging your belongings on the wall when you move someplace new. \n\nSo, I think in this pic the boys were being jokesters by putting actual spoons on the wall lol.

This watercolor is a variant of one of the artist's most popular subjects, \u2018Un b\u00e2ton de cage.\u2019 Another variation of this composition in the Lucas Collection of The Baltimore Museum of Art is inscribed: \u2018Giacomelli a Mr. Lucas affecteux souvenir d'une aquarelle.\u2019 Henri Beraldi wrote of this artist, \u2018Giacomelli is the Van Huysum [Jan Van Huysum, 1682-1749, Dutch flower-painter] of tiny birds, tender and ravishing, which give the impression of being pensive. The bird is to Giacomelli what the cat is to Lambert [Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Lambert, 1825-1900, French painter who specialized in cat subjects]. A respectable bird must be a Giacomelli bird; A non-Giacomelli bird is a false bird,\u2019 (H. Beraldi, \u2018Les Graveurs du XIXE si\u00e8cle,\u2019 Paris, 1885-92, 7:105).\u201d",

Back then, it was a thing to cast popular actresses in gallant, swashbuckling male roles.  It gave actresses access to a wider range of roles (because god forbid you just write a female character who isn't a swooning love interest) and conveniently doubled as an excuse to dress her in hose.\n\nIt's actually not that different from a Wonder Woman portrait.  A feminine power figure who's badass^tm because she does traditionally masculine things, but she's still gotta be smoking hot and show off them gams.",

Actually reverse that, these guys are obviously hobbyists because they're taking a random shot of \"hanging in the dorm room\" -- a typical person wouldn't even think to capture such a mundane scene, but these guys not only are proud of their collection of photographs, they're also creative enough to think this is an interesting scene.\n\nI know it's weird to imagine in today's world of \"I'm in line at McDonald's, lemme record a snap real quick\", but back then with the technologies available, it was a real production just to get people in position and set up the equipment for a shot. Then you have to develop it and hope you don't duck up the process.\n\nLong story short, I will bet you a brilliant uncirculated 1910 mintmark fifty dollar gold eagle coin that these guys were in the top 1% of \"guys with photos as their dorm room decor\" at the time.\n\nEdit: as I've been informed, snap shot photography was not as exclusive as I had thought by 1910. I still stand by my hobbyist claim, these guys were definitely nerdy enough to make photography part of their identity in a time when that was still a fairly new thing to do.",

It\u2019s eerie to look at.\n\nI wonder sometimes what it\u2019s done to us, mentally and socially, to have accumulated such a colossal, uncountable number of boring photos or our own dumbass, self-conscious faces, taken at arm\u2019s length. Or how, instead of eye-contact, babies often now see their parents faces looking at phone screens which are projecting an image of their baby to be recorded. It takes all the specialness out of photos.",

I have that picture of him and two of his brothers, and one other of him, his father, and a brother, and that\u2019s all. \n\nMeanwhile, I took ten pictures of my dog this afternoon. \n\nPersonally, I am so grateful to have so many photos so easily at hand. I love cruising through my camera roll and seeing a blurry snap of my friend not looking at the camera, or being able to see how my kittens grew week to week. I like to think my great-grandfather would have taken so many more pictures if only he\u2019d had the means. \n\nThat said, I *do* really enjoy analog photography for that extra \u201cspecialness.\u201d Even the quirks and mistakes on film seem charming given how easy it is to take awful-to-incredible digital photos with barely a thought.",

I literally have Rubbermaid bins full of old family photos that I have no idea what to do with. And my sister has the same amount of bins AND a closet full of slide trays. \n\nSo anyway, a ton of the pics I have are traditional studio or posed shots. But my favorites are the outdoor candid ones where my grandfather was \u201callowed\u201d to let his artistic side out. You can see him playing with natural light or trying to capture the wind and sometimes looking at them takes my breath away. I appreciate modern day photography but I appreciate the old stuff a little more knowing that person had one chance to capture the moment.

Tuberculosis (consumption) was considered the height of fashion for women in the Victorian period. I appreciate that we have actual medicine like antibiotics and most don\u2019t actually need to dope themselves up to bear living.",

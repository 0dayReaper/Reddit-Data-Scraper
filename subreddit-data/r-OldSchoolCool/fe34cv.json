The 1980s, by contrast, aren\u2019t foreign. Yet.",

Another thought that I\u2019ve had before is that the true, cultural decades that define the time are the \u201cbetween decades,\u201d if you will. The mid-70s to the mid-80s seem like a more cohesive time than the 70s or 80s alone. Same with, say, 55-65 or 95-05. Things seem, to me anyway, to be more alike during those periods than 1950 to 1960.",

It was the decade of war and fear that ended with hope with Obama. It was a very culturally defining decade with many big moments (Bush/Gore, 9/11, both wars, the financial crises/recession, Obama getting elected, social media becoming a thing etc). \n\nThis past decade was really mundane in comparison, but the country needed a breather after the aughts I feel. Trump was probably the most significant thing to happen imo.",

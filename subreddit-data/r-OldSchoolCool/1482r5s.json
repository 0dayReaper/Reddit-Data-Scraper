            "comment": "True story about me and my friends. There were about 10 of us who caravanned down together from Athens, GA. We had reserved one room at a hotel for all 10 of us. When we got to the hotel and fell out of the cars, two of our guys who had been imbibing some illegal stuff in the car on the way down wandered off together without telling anyone while we were still all in the parking lot and hadn't gotten the room yet.\n\nThe hotel causeway overlooking the parking lot was ringed with guys hooting and hollering at something in the parking lot. When we looked, it was two girls we knew from our dorm who were topless in bikini bottoms with some girls we didn't know, putting on a show for the guys.\n\nWe didn't see our lost friends again for THREE DAYS. We had no idea if they were alive or dead or how they were going to find us ( pre cell phone days, folks ). We all crashed drunk one night and when we woke up the next morning ... there they were lying on the floor of our hotel room. No one could remember letting them in. One of my other friends went to get dressed and there was puke in the paper grocery bag he was using as a suitcase for his clothes, all over his clothes.\n\nWe woke up the previously missing guys to get their story. Why had they disappeared? Where had they been for three days? How'd they find us? How'd they get into the room? Neither of them could remember anything about the last three days or how they had found us during the night, but one of them remembered throwing up in the bag, thinking it was trash. Folks, that was Daytona spring break in the 1980's.\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.",

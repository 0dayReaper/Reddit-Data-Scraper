Admittedly, that's probably just the record speed, but it's clear that well before the *vast* majority of portrait photos were taken, speed of exposure was not an issue. The stiltedness is nothing to do with having to hold still, it's because a photograph was a fairly expensive thing to have done and people wanted to have an expression similar to what you would have in a painted portrait. Its entirely stylistic/cultural and nothing to do with technological limitations of the medium.",

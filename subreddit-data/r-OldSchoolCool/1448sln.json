The son of a wealthy railroad tycoon started planting bananas along the land owned by the company to be built into rail and then all of the sudden, it's merging with standard fruit and owning over half the land in Guatemala.\n\nSo so many characters from 20th century America play a role in this too. My favorite part was the state department negotiating directly with the Guatemalan gov't *on the behalf of United Fruit* because so many people in Eisenhower's cabinet were tied to the executive board of united fruit. Just sickening.",

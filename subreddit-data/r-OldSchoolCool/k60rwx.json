So Freddy's final resting place will be a secret forever.  There's something poetic about that.",

Freddy didn't want to have his loved ones visiting him at a grave where any obsessed fans might have gone the route of grave robbing and he didn't want them to go through that either. \n\nThe relationship between Mary and Freddy, to me, is a perfect example of why I believe that a person's soulmate isn't always their romantic partner. I believe that soulmates are people who know one another inside and out, have a bond of trust, never a secret between them and a shared ability to know the other person as well as they know themselves. I also believe that soulmates can exist between more than just two individuals. It's not uncommon for friends to have a trio\n\nMy(F 35) soulmate (F who was 9 months older than me, nearly to the day) passed just over 8 years ago. She was my best friend, my other half. She had this uncanny ability, even through text messaging, to know exactly what I needed at any given moment. What I mean is, if I had something nagging at me but hadn't figured out what I wanted to say, if anything, or what exactly was bothering me in the first place; whether I was feeling giddy over news I wanted to share but was choosing to hold back until I got to hear how her kids were doing and updates on what things they were into at any particular point; if I was holding back grief while being sure my texts were upbeat and cheerful so no one knew, she did. \n\nShe would recognize something in my voice during calls but in texts when it's usually easy to play something off, she just knew and more importantly, she knew exactly what I needed from her as the best friend. She would just recognize without me saying a word, whether I needed advice or simply for her to listen, whether I was in need of a tough love conversation or even lecture (that last one being extremely rare and usually brief lol). \n\nAnyhow, I never understood how she just knew. I always *felt like* I was doing the same for her but we never actually talked about it specifically. \n\nFreddie and Mary's relationship reminds of my friend and myself, and while I have lost plenty of loved ones who were often far too young and died tragically in my life. When my time comes, however even if it's just endless nothingness, it is my deepest hope that she is the first person, or only if that's the case. \n\nI believe that Mary probably feels the same way about Freddy.",

The gay guy bought this man an expensive car and a motocycle and other good stuff until the straight man got sick of having sex with him.\n\nHe decided to murder him expecting that all the gay mans fortune will go to him and now he is serving life in prison.",

My dad is professional musician in Atlanta, where Elton lives, and as such has an acquainted relationship with him (cordial, when they see each other Elton knows who he is, asks how hes doing, how his kids are, etc.)\n\nElton is everything he is portrayed to be and more. He'll sit down with anyone and carry on a conversation like theyre the only person in that room, and no one is more important than his current acquaintance. He was recording a single for a fundraiser, and they were recording session musicians. Elton was overseeing and helping produce. During the session, he was showing me what all the buttons on the board did, describing how back in the day, they recorded everything on tape and now it was all digital and how much easier it made it, etc. At one point, the engineer asked Elton if he was ready to wrap the session, to which replied \"yes\" but that the engineer could take a break while he chatted with me some more. Elton and I sat at this massive recording board while my dad sat on a couch for over an hour chatting about the Braves.\n\nI'll never forget that as long as I live.",

Mary Austin inherited Garden Lodge, which had a total of five cats (not including Oscar). Two of the cats were then rehomed, as she found five cats to be too much.\n\n&gt;Delilah, Freddie\u2019s favorite, lived to be an estimated twenty years old which is very old but a possible age for a cat. Peter Freestone, Freddie\u2019s personal assistant wrote of visiting Mary at Garden Lodge some time in the early 2000s. Delilah was very old and frail but remembered him and fell asleep on his lap for a good two hours. Mary buried her in Freddie\u2019s beloved garden.\n\n&gt;Mary did not leave the two rehomed cats at an animal shelter. Instead, they were given to friends/neighbors. One cat, Romeo was aggressive towards Delilah, Goliath and Miko (who was bonded to the siblings). Maybe he fought with Mary\u2019s cats and she thought he would do better in a home with no other cats. In fact, the cats had eclectic origins. Delilah and her brother Goliath were strays housed at a veterinary clinic. Tiffany was a gift from Mary. At least two of the cats were purchased as kittens on impulse by Jim from a local pet shop from separate occasions (Jim couldn\u2019t resist the adorable kittens in the shop\u2019s window!). Mary was a cat lover too, after all, so I don\u2019t think she disliked the cats. Based on how long Delilah lived she was probably well cared for by Mary.",

And if you like men in any capacity... Must be gay then. There\u2019s less wiggle room for bi guys and it\u2019s stupid af.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s more accepting for women to be bi for several reasons. Women\u2019s sexuality aren\u2019t viewed as seriously. Women\u2019s femininity aren\u2019t reliant on their sexuality. Lesbianism is fetishized so it\u2019s acceptable for straight women to play with other women.\n\nBut yeah. It\u2019s a bunch of bi erasure.\n\nEdit: To clarify one of my points, since people seem to be misunderstanding: People, predominantly men, fetishize lesbians. Example: Boyfriends who say they wouldn\u2019t mind if their girlfriends cheated on them with a women. This is what I meant by \u201cacceptable for straight women to play with other women\u201d. I am not referring to bi women in this instance. And I was using this as one of my examples for why women are less pressured to \u201cpick a side\u201d like men are (see also: more women identify as bi than men. Sexuality for men is much more polarized than for women). My two points of evidence were: women\u2019s sexuality isn\u2019t taken seriously and lesbianism is fetishized.",

From my understanding in a lot of lesbian relationships they tend to dive headfirst into the relationship but also end up with \"dead bedrooms\" quite often. Whereas gay relationships are often the opposite where getting sex is supremely easy but finding another man that wants to be in a committed relationship is a bit harder.",

The article might be wrong in stating that Mary gets his parents share. If I am reading the will correctly she only gets that share if his sister and his sisters children also die before the vesting date. In the mean time his parents share accrue to his sister or her children.\n\nAs /u/thunder_struck85 mentioned I think they are mixing present and past values. Freddie Mercury bought the house for \u00a3500,000 in cash from a member of the Hoare family early in 1980 so I think the $37 million is how much the home was worth in 2019 New Zealand dollars.\n\nI can't link to them directly because the spam filter in this sub deletes comments with links, but the following incomplete links, which can be copied and pasted to your browser, go to the nzherald.co.nz article and his will:\n\nnzherald.co.nz/entertainment/freddie-mercurys-ex-fiancee-set-for-huge-75m-windfall/ROXOQRU7UQ5ZVADPZ2KP2BLO4U/\n\ntaringa.net/+musica/testamento-de-freddie-mercury_i1g90",

I've never been sexually or romantically attracted to him, but we just connect on a whole other plane. I've never experienced mutual *passion* with another person, but while we have been trying to date separately it's so incredibly difficult contemplating the possibility that at some point we will actually split up.\n\nHe's just my person, I guess.",

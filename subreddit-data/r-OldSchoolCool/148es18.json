I mean, the Nazis killed something like 75% of all communists and perhaps half the Social Democrats. \n\nIn the West, Nazis were recycled, but if they made one step out of line, they became social pariahs. People remembered pretty much how the Nazis used to party and boss everybody around while they were starving and were being bombed daily. \n\nI don't know any other people who so deeply changed their culture and world view so fast after they commited atrocities. Even RSA under Mandela, despite it's truth and reconciliation thingy, wasn't peachy.",

He took up a spot 25 feet from FDR and the mayor of Chicago, Anton Cermak. Unable to see over the crowd he climbed on a folding chair and took aim at FDR. However, in the moment he pulled the trigger the chair wobbled and his shot missed FDR.\n\nIt instead struck and killed Cermak. Zangara was then wrestled to the ground by the crowd while firing the rest of his ammunition. Flailing while he fired, he struck and injured five bystanders. FDR escaped the assassination attempt unscathed.",

He was exiled from the dominant Irish-American political system of Chicago at the time and was forced to garner support and attention through a focus on disenfranchised immigrant and black populations in the city. Being an immigrant himself he recognized how little attention was paid to politics by the immigrant populations and he realized this could be a major base of support. He revolutionized how the Democratic partied engaged with the immigrant populations. The attention brought to him through these efforts was significant enough for him to earn FDR's endorsement, which brought in the growing black electorate. When Cermak challenged the Republican incumbent, William H. Thompson, in the mayoral race of 1931 he won 58% of the vote. \n\nWilliam H. Thompson was the last Republican mayor of Chicago.",

It\u2019s not too crazy of an idea to consider when you realize he was part of NY elite. A lot of his New Deal specifically excluded black men from applying for them and receiving benefits, even veterans. Also, at the time this was all occurring, a bunch of businesses sprung up to make use of the repaired economy and adverise themselves to returning GI\u2019s. A lot of these businesses refused service to Blacks and FDR did nothing to stop them. Despite pleas from black Americans, FDR kept silent in the face of black Americans being taken advantage of. One of the more famous services that was famously anti-white was Levitt-Towns.\n \nA pair of brothers, the Levitts, had been able to make precut military forward operating bases for the purposes of them being brought abroad during the war. The benefit of being precut meant they could be constructed in an instant and mass manufactured for the army. After the war, these same brothers utilized their pre-cut manufacturing to start making pre-fabricated homes. They would mass manufacture the pieces and you could order a home from a catalog. \n\nThe GI bill at the time offered $8,000 to returning soldiers for the purposes of buying a home. The Levitt\u2019s priced their homes at $7,999, ensuring your entire house could be paid for with the GI bill with no outstanding cost to you, the consumer. It was a \u201cfree house.\u201d  The suburbs as an idea came about because of these homes. Developers would make entire neighborhoods with these homes with one important stipulation - No Blacks Allowed.\n\nIn some cases, even black GI\u2019s were denied access to aspects of the bill, including the Mortgage benefit.\n\nFDR saved the union but he was no friend for Black Americans. Although there is very little evidence that he was outright racist, you can infer from the totality of the circumstances surrounding his presidency that he was most certainly prejudiced.",

Hitler rebuked Schirach, exclaiming something along the lines 'that the Americans should be ashamed at letting their medals be won by negroes'.\n\nThe episode is described on the first few pages of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's landmark biography of Adolf Hitler, \"Nemesis, 1936\u20131945\". Kershaw's two-part biography is generally considered a masterpiece, and has been honored by German military historian Roman T\u00f6ppel as by and far the best Hitler biography ever written.",

The barmaids were having none of it and ordered the white MPs to go to the back of the queue and wait their turn. \n\nAnd if you're visiting the UK, the one thing you don't do is cut a queue.",

Check out the stories of Polish generals Stanislaw Sosabowski and Stanislaw Maczek. Maczek received a secret pension from the Dutch after WWII, and they even raised funds for the general after they found out his daughter needed expensive medical treatment. I went to the Netherlands a couple years ago, and I was moved by how they, to this day, continue to honor the allied forces who liberated them, they keep war cemeteries immaculate, clean the headstones, lay flowers and wreaths on them. The \u201cbetrayal\u201d by fellow Allies is one of the reasons why Poles are still salty about WWII, and I can\u2019t say I blame them.",

Most of them weren't reported as it was deemed \"unpatriotic\".\n\nMy favorite was a 10 night riot that involved just the all-black US 394th Quartermaster Battalion and the all-white US 208th Coast Artillery.  Basically that riot started due to resentment of the blacks having access to the dance halls where they could mingle with white women.  A 10 day riot ensued in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nAs a result of that riot the blacks were segregated on the other side of Brisbane River.  There was a second one-night riot, and blacks were often murdered by MPs or beaten and knifed for crossing the river.\n\nEventually this would culminate with the Battle of Brisbane, where the Australian and American soldiers fought each other through the streets of Brisbane.\n\nDo you know just how bad it has to be to have Australians, with their history of aboriginal abuse, to say to the Americans \"Hey now, that's a bit too much\". Although truthfully the Aussies found the Americans to be arrogant of their own accord, and since the Americans were paid more they had better luck with the women than the Aussies did.\n\nThere's also the Battel of Bamber Bridge in England.  In that case the black regiment fought back.  The gist of it is that the US army wasn't comfortable mixing races.  They tried to segregate the British towns inns and pubs, and it became \"unoffical\" that blacks would only be welcome in certain places.  When 4 black servicemen wandered into the wrong pub.  A group of MPs tried to arrest them, the British servicemen sided with the blacks, the MPs retreated, gathered reinforcements, and returned en-mass to arrest the black soldiers.  The ensuing battle saw one person shot dead and the rest of the beaten african-american servicemen retreating back to base.  The MPs went to get them (using a machine-gun equipped jeep in the process) and the black servicemen broke out their weapons to fight back.  The ensuing firefight lasted all night.\n\nIn the end 32 black soldiers were court marshalled for mutiny for not turning over their compatriots to be beaten by the white MPs.  Some were sentenced to 15 years.",

My uncle was also a bit of a reactionary, who was good at finding racism wherever he looked! His family often joked about it, and made fun of it. So when he said Ford wasn\u2019t racist, I believed him!",

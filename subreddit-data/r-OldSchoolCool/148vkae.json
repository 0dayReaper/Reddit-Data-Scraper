Their career tactic starting out was not to saturate the world with their brand so they have longevity. Which is why they consciously made the decision to not play multiple nights in one city. Leave people wanting more. VH had really good management and Roth was notable for being good at self promotion. Unfortunately, a lot of bands have poor management and they shoot the entire wad in the first few years. Van Halen was relevant for about 17  -18 years in popular sentiment of their new music. The Balance album and tour 95-96 was the end of that relevancy. One hell of a run!!!!  It wasn't until about 2007 they became a legacy band.",

I never did spend money for it, but that's an old teenage memory involving this movie, in that I was supposed to get a copy of it, but I never did.\n\nThis was also not long before Suncoast closed...\n\nAnyway, I still want to see this, despite how bad I keep seeing and hearing about how it is. I reckon it would be a bit more enjoyable then that Bee-Gees and Peter Frampton \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" 1970s movie.",

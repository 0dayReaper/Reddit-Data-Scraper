The whole idea with adults was to be able to show future generations what Grandpa Lothrop looked like. The photos of the dead were displayed in the common rooms of the house. Just a picture of dead Lothrop on the table. Times were different. If you look at pictures taken in old houses, you\u2019ll often see at least a few pictures of dead people in them. \n\nThe death masks were the same concept, just infinitely creepier. I have a friend who collects old death masks. He thinks it\u2019s important to try and preserve them so that maybe one day a descendant of the original face will be able to see what their ancestors looked like.",

It seems to be quite a wide angle from the way the ground slopes down. I believe this would have had a lot more of the surroundings in in an uncropped version of the photo and then Arbus might have decided to crop the surroundings out in favor of a close-up. Generally, we aren't used to wide-angle lenses being used for close-ups because it tends to distort facial features and other proportions.",

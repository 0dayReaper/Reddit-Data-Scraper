I remember Tool better as I was able to walk right up to the stage! They had a man open for Tool juggling a chainsaw &amp; a baby doll, and he\u2019d cut up the doll mid-air. To this day, I cannot believe a juggling act opened for Tool! (It was the coolest juggler I\u2019ve ever seen, but still crazy to think about) There were probably only 200 people watching Tool on the side stage at the beginning. Maybe 400 at the finish which is Crazy! They played so fucking loud and were so fucking good I\u2019ll never forget it. I feel so fortunate to be able to experience that as a teenager. What a time to be alive.",

You can cherrypick events from any time in history and make it seem like a dark time or an excellent time. \n\nIn the 90s you could have been worried about the LA riots, our President lying to the American public, Desert Storm, etc. In the 80s it would have been the Cold War and the market crash. \n\nWe didn\u2019t care about that stuff in the 80s and 90s because we were young and it didn\u2019t really affect us. We cared about the financial crisis in 2008 because it directly affected our ability to start a career. \n\nThink about what our grandparents and parents went through. Mine all went through WWII and Vietnam. My wife\u2019s father remembered hiding in the underground in London during WWII. My grandfather had flashbacks to D-Day. My great grandmother told me when I was 5 about when she forced off her land because \u201cthe white people\u201d wanted to live there. \n\nAll of that, and yet they put their heads down and worked, built businesses, had children, passed the torch. \n\nOur entire existence as a species has been about \u201ckeeping our heads above water.\u201d The only difference now is that more and more people don\u2019t think they should have to swim. For some reason everyone thinks there should be this giant golden life raft that floats around and saves people. But it\u2019s never been like that and it never will be.",

                    "comment": "I was lucky enough to meet Tom and Brad on separate occasions. Tom, briefly at an RATM show in Lowell, MA back in the 90s. He was super friendly, asked my name, lovely guy. Then Brad in a Whole Foods in Santa Monica nearly 20 years later. We were in the same aisle and I excused myself and said, \u201cHi Brad, sorry to bother, but Rage was a huge reason that I\u2019m a musician. And I met Tom when I was a teen and it was epic.\u201d He was so kind and we chatted a bit. It was great. But then, about a month later, I was walking around Palisades Park in Santa Monica and I saw Brad sitting on a bench with a woman. He saw me and actually waved at me! From like 50 yards away! It was so nice I almost died.",

And I remember seeing and reading about their early concerts in 92 to 94 and being like \"Wow, that was so long ago!\". Now I look at it and it doesn't even seem that long between those years.

It\u2019s nice to see you 90s mosh pits kids pop up your heads and say hi. You guys gave me a wave of nostalgia. RATM in particular has a special place in my heart. \n\nI am a nonconformist at my core. I don\u2019t need to challenge all authority around me, but I need the freedom to be different. RATM\u2019s stark rebuke of the powers that be, spotlighting systemic injustice, and criticism of modern western culture was my jam in an otherwise plain middle and upper class high school in suburban Detroit in the 90s. \n\nI remember reading an essay in class about latent racism in America inspired by a RATM song and everyone looking so uncomfortable.  \n\nAnd of course I know mosh pits are still a thing. But, as one or two of you aptly pointed out, that type of release was very much part of our zeitgeist in that moment and time. We have grown and changed. Now I struggle to find all the energy I need to get everything done. Cheers!",

His favourite amp got stolen so he made a mad dash to the music store to improvise a rig with what they had left (50 watt Marshall and a Peavey cabinet.)     \n    \nHe wasn\u2019t even that happy with the sound until one day he just set it to where it was useable, marked the settings with a sharpie and focused on making music with it, which is now *the* sound we associate with Rage. I think a big part of it as that Peavey cabinet because they have Celestion G12K speakers inside which sound amazing. My favourite guitar speaker.",

They got old, started working some immoral job screwing people out of insurance claims or something similar and sold out. So the message of the music no longer speaks to them. \n\nAbsolute boomer problem.",

That dude does not play guitar, he just creates music out of the ether and the guitar just happens to be the instrument that is blessed with expressing his sonic creation.",

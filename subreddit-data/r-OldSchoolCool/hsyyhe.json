He\u2019s nearly 40lb now so I don\u2019t wear him much anymore.\n\nI was the same way; very nervous about babies. I had actually only held one baby once before I had one myself, and I had to have that baby carefully placed in my hands and I basically stayed completely still. But once I had my kid I saw the way doctors and nurses handled the babies.. of course they weren\u2019t rough but they definitely weren\u2019t handling them like they were made of glass. I don\u2019t know that I would have survived the infant stage if I hadn\u2019t watched them so closely.",

He was my teacher at my elementary school and kids would often ask me how he was my uncle. It confused me for a while because I never saw him as my \u201cblack uncle\u201d he was always just my uncle. Eventually I started telling them he was married into the family and that was just not a concept that other kids understood. Hopefully interracial marriage becomes more accepted so kids don\u2019t see what\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d with having an uncle of another race. I consider having him as my uncle one of the most important aspects of my life because that man would do anything for me and it really taught me to be colorblind. Not to mention he helped create my cousin who is one of my best friends.",

Geeze even my mother dated a Carribean man when I was preschool age for years and I didn't notice. \n\nIt took moving to a very white Acadian/French area to realize that what was normal to me was not normal to everyone else.",

That said, being colorblind isn't necessarily a good thing. It's good to see color, it makes us unique and has a lot of past/heritage behind those pigments. Also it is good to see color because I see my friends of color who have a harder time than me, a white male. People of color need to be seen, heard, and understood that they don't always have it easy and you can't see all as exactly the same because they need our help to get them to a better, more equal place in society. I'm confident you had no malicious intent with your words, and to take it further I believe you meant those words with a good heart. I just wanted to say this because I had a friend mention that being colorblind isn't necessarily a good thing and ignores the differences between races. Thanks again for your story, it was lovely!",

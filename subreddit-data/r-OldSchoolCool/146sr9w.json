I guess these kids were mostly born just as the war was ending, or shortly thereafter and so they probably grew up with some form of austerity (even if they may have been from elite/privileged backgrounds).  Perhaps this influenced their thought process in a sort of master-servant way and the old world order.  They may have had some awareness on their place in society in that they recognize they may not have much influence on building the future as there are powers far greater that will ultimately decide for them.",

There's millions of acres of open land in the UK, it's called the countryside. The reason we don't just build houses in then is because they're in the middle of nowhere so providing the infrastructure to a new housing estate is prohibitive. So we build around the edges of existing towns and cities. We're also not overpopulated. Lack of services is not down to population growth, it's down to government funding. Lack of housing isn't down to overpopulation, it's that building houses is in the hands of entirely profit driven companies who sell to landlords. So the amount of housing and then affordable housing is reduced significantly. Again, look at who's in charge as to why it seems like the rich only get richer from that policy.",

Their accuracy will amaze you.** \"\n\nNot a chance....**none** of these predictions have come to fruition in the modern world.  There is no extreme issues from over population, no radiation from Nuclear war, no machines taking over to the point that there are no jobs for anyone.  Yes computer technology would be the only thing sort of accurate about the predictions of these children, but even then they did not know anything about social networks and the movements from them that change society or people with their faces constantly stuck in a smart phone.  The pessimism about the future was what really stuck out to me about this video.  The fact is, societies adapt and still lead their lives...have babies, get married, have an occupation, and even thrive in their lives.  There are problems in the world that is for sure, but not to the level of apocalyptic events of which some of the children were expressing.  So I am going to call the tag line of this video... \"BS\"...",

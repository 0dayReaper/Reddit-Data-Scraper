At night after everyone is gone to bed I always just sit in the dark, only the tree lights on, and watch it shimmer. Then when the sun shines on the tree in the afternoon I just love the bright reflections. It reminds me of my childhood,  when my granny saved every single crinkly lead icicle for the next year's tree. Those shimmery strands and the smell of an orange are all I need to summon every sweet Christmas memory of my life. Never mind the cat poo linked like strand, ball, strand, ball. They all lived very long lives.  The dogs, too. All gone now, and most of my family.  But I imagine I'll do a tree until I'm gone, too.",

However, when I can find the thin string tinsel I buy it because sometimes you just want that twinkly nostalgia (no matter what kind of headache you\u2019re creating when it\u2019s time to put it all away).",

I wouldn't be surprised if this was for a Christmas card, which people still do today.\n\nIt's not like this is the late 19th/early 20th century. The Brownie had been around for decades already and there were many, many other cameras being sold at various prices.",

Cameras were pretty common, but film and getting it developed were expensive. So people would often only use it at special occasions and then get their film developed maybe once or twice per year. \n\nNot an expert on this by any means, it's just what I've read before somewhere.",

It\u2019s only been ten years since I last used a film camera.  \n\nThat being said the cost of developing pictures went down in the late 90\u2019s.  In the early nineties a roll of film would be around 15-20 dollars for 25 images.  Some rolls were longer and it cost the same, but the most you would typically get was 30 pictures from a roll.  By the late 90\u2019s early 2000\u2019s it was $11 to develop a roll.  I remember it being around 5-7 dollars when I was a kid in the 80\u2019s.  Depending on your job, it was around 1-2 hours wage for a working class teenager.\n\nThese are Canadian prices by the way.  I don\u2019t remember currency rates, but it was much cheaper in states when I was young even factoring for exchange rates.",

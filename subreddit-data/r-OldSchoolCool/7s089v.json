There were hockey teams called the Swastikas is in Canada. Christmas cards had swastikas on them. The courthouse rotunda in Redwood City California has swastikas in the tile patterns. The Finnish Air Force had swastika is on their planes before Hitler came to power. It's on the palms of Buddha's hands and feet and was present on just about every continent and in every culture's art and religious symbolism.\n\nThe swastika is an attractive, powerful, graphic symbol with Millennia of History all over the world. One asshole decided it was really cool in 1933 and for 12 years did his best to make sure nobody found it attractive ever again.",

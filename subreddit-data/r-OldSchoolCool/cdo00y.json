You earn what's called a \"slave wage\" or a wage that is so low that it doesn't make sense for the owner of land to just replace you with a human being he owns. \n\nThe value of labor then reduces to the absolute minimum. Because it is so cheap there is very little investment in making it more efficient for either the landowner or the worker. As a consequence, there is very little investment in education. What's the point in having the population put off work for years to be better workers when you could just hire more for dirt cheap? This leads to substantially lower education growth throughout the south. The process of industrialization, in which tools and systems are implemented to improve the productivity of labor, similarly bypass the South entirely. The effects of this lack of investment and other aspects of a slave based economy can still be seen and felt today throughout much of the American South.\n\nNone of this is to diminish the horrible experience that actual slaves lived through, but rather to point out an aspect of a culture that allows slavery to exist that people often don't think about.\n\nIn a competitive market, the degradation of the value of any person's labor begets the degradation of the value of every person's labor.",

The impoverished whites in the region looked at them (without education or having been taught to think critically) and saw them as the reason they weren\u2019t able to get jobs. \nIt\u2019s the same way people blame migrant workers who pick America\u2019s fruit and vegetables in terrible conditions (sometimes actual slave-like conditions, especially in Florida tomato fields), instead of seeing economic pressures and greedy companies who are choosing to keep the market incredibly low. And then all of us as consumers who demand dirt-cheap food.",

Aretha was a phenomenal singer but she helped give rise to the new kind of singing that values being louder and \"trying hard\" over clarity and.... Naturalness... I can't think of a better word...\n\nI can think fo 1000 singers that can sing Aretha's song because her style is easier to learn and is less based on natural talent/biology. I still have yet to hear and single person sing Ella's songs as well as Ella did. Hell I can pick Ella's voice out right away when I'm listening to the radio even if it's a song I've never heard.",

She followed the money and what people told her to do to a certain extent, and all the while enduring abuse. Her newer work I think is more representative of who she is as an artist, though it isn\u2019t pop enough to gain her the same type of fame. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that they were saying \u201csurprisingly high\u201d instead of asking why she was hiding it it?",

Several Vegas hotels were segregated and wouldn't let Sammy Davis stay in them. Sinatra, not wanting Davis to be excluded, took the issue to management and straight up threatened to use his mob connections to kill them for the insult. Management suddenly decided segregation was bad for some reason. \n\nStill, many of the hotels would drain the pool after Davis took a swim over fears of negro contamination. Davis spent a lot of time in the pool after he heard about this.",

People don't realize how famous he was and how well respected he was. Someone could hate his guts and be in direct competition with him, but if he said don't play this club they wouldn't set foot in it. Not even out of fear, but because Frank fucking Sinatra said it was shit.\n\nIt's like when two goons from (I think) the Italian mob kidnapped random black performer to extort some money from a local theatre, but the boss realized it was Jimi Hendrix and beat the shit out of the goons, gave him a shitload of money, and had him dropped off at his venue in a limo. Hendrix was tripping at the time and largely apathetic to the situation. But there are some people that get so big that nobody on god's green earth will fuck with them.",

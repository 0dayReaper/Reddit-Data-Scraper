We have a documentary about us on Netflix called heroin(e).  \nWe have a restaurant in the middle of town that he visited while he was here that still stands and you can go and eat in his booth. It\u2019s sort of a pilgrimage for budding politicians and people of note in town. I believe president Bush stopped and ate in the booth when he ran for office. \nIt\u2019s amazing what an impact that man had on our area that his energy is still being used and still moving WV today.

I grew up in the 1970s in the upper Midwest, in a city with a dozen Catholic high schools, and basically everybody I knew was Catholic. We had neighbors who were Presbyterian, and although I played with their kids, I always thought there must be something weird about them. It never occurred to me that people in other parts of the United States were anything but Catholic.\n\nFast forward to around 2009, when I was first dating my now-wife. She mentioned to her grandmother, a fire and brimstone Southern Baptist from rural Virginia, that I was Catholic. Grandma got very quiet and serious. \"Now, is he the *Christian* kind of Catholic, or the other kind?\"\n\nI'm still not certain what the \"other kind\" is, but my wife assured her that I was \"the Christian kind,\" which gave her some small comfort.",

I think it is clear that since at least Carter left office, Democrats have generally lost their way with the working class. It's become all a bunch of increased privatization and deregulation. Who do we think shoulders the brunt of this? It's always the working person.\n\nAnd it's easier now to pretend that in places like West Virginia, where there used to be very progressive and radical movements and people specifically around Labor issues, that they are all a bunch of hopelessly lost racists.

I think, from what I have read on during the election, Nixon mostly pulled a Hillary Clinton where he largely (though not exclusively) kept talking about how his previous experience should be why people voted for him. He didn't have any actual ideas that were his own, original, progressive even. Nothing. Just \"I've been at this game for a while so vote for me.\"",

He tells them that they should remember how lucky they are and always do what they can to help.  I really think that they somehow, despite their great wealth, had somehow stayed grounded.

So they'd offer stupidly low salaries and awful working conditions (often with a language like Mandarin in the job requirements), nobody would apply, and they'd bring in workers from another country who didn't know their rights at all. Then they'd get them an apartment with 4-5 others and deduct unfair amounts from their paychecks for rent. The end result wasn't all that far off from human slavery, with employees having no idea they could complain to anyone and being threatened with being fired and deported if they ever spoke up. ",

He was going to vote Nixon, much to the chagrin of my grandma, who definitely had a crush on JFK. He was handsome, catholic and most importantly, he advocated for a lot of her beliefs. I think grandpa was jealous, honestly.\n\nWell, my grandpa and JFK eat slowly and spend an hour talking life and politics. My grandma remembered her husband coming home positively starstruck. His views of Kennedy did a complete 180, along with his political views. He was a WWII veteran of above average intelligence and a stubbornness that my dad says is legendary. It took John F. Kennedy an hour to completely alter his entire worldview. And it\u2019s my favorite family story.",

When my grandmother was a small child, one of her chores was to take a hoe out every morning and cut down any grass or weeds that had tried to pop up in the yard overnight.\n\nBy the time of this photo they had lawnmowers, but I would assume that people as desperately poor as these would not waste the time or money on something as frivolous as lawn care and so continued with the hard-packed dirt yard.",

I'm 38 and 75% of the people I grew up with have left the area. My little town had two bars, two stores and a doctors office. Thats all gone now. The vibe of the place is totally different. When I was a teenager you could cruise the strip and see 1000 kids having a good time. If you didn't want to do that you could go hang out at the park and their would be tons of people partying and having a good.  Now if two cars are sitting and talkimg the cops show up.I asked my little cousin what kids do now and she said they don't do anything but go to friends houses. I know partying isn't everything but the place used to be jumping. Socially you always had something to do. If I was bored I went to town and hung out with who ever was there and some one was always there. The whole county is a ghost town. Sorry for the confusing reply I can't get into words what I'm trying to say.",

I\u2019ve never seen this much poverty, homeless, drugs, trash everywhere, vandalism, cars broken in to, CONSTANT theft even in broad daylight of anything not nailed - and if it is, it\u2019ll be sawed off with tools. It\u2019s not even localized - it\u2019s literally everywhere. You can\u2019t go biking at night along certain trails or areas because the homeless live in the wooded areas of the trail and can attack you. Plenty of knife stabbings along bike paths (someone made a website called \u201cstabtown\u201d to record all of the stabbings and how many days we have gone without one). Dogs being stolen from owners properties. Needles just about anywhere you can imagine. \n\nAside from the obvious, it\u2019s gone to shit by becoming unaffordable. Generations of oregonians can no longer afford to live here. And it\u2019s becoming monotonous - small unique shops being priced out or bought by developers and chain stores to be replaced by starbucks or some redundant shop thats on each main street. And it\u2019s funny because people moved here for how \u201ccool\u201d it is, except all of the cool shit is literally gone. You can\u2019t even be all#wanderlusty and go camping without planning months in advance because the campsites are completely booked up constantly. Ugh.",

Now the city can\u2019t keep up with the influx of people. \n\nHell, I\u2019m renting my first house out to some people 5-6 years younger than me for almost double what i charged when I first bought a place closer to my job. And I charge almost nothing compared to the average rent in that neighborhood. The cost of everything has gone up. \n\nIt\u2019s clear it\u2019s bad and people are **still** moving here in waves.

But the homeless is also a symptom of income inequality, and the system of that inequality which is growing worse yearly. \n\nCharlie Hales , a former mayor of Portland who ironically lived in washington (he wanted to avoid property taxes), made some declaration that \u201ccamping within the city limits is permitted\u201d. That kind of information spreads throughout the homeless community FAST., so many have come here for that reason. There are even websites called \u201cvagabond\u201d or \u201cbusker nation\u201d or something that is basically a giant forum for those people to tell others where to go (on a national scale), where to panhandle, etc etc. that being said, in a sense its nice that they have a supportive community but i say it to emphasize that any potential exploitation is spread quick and many will flock to that area to do just that. Like a giant migration. ",

Once you know that, the rest is really just adding rice and some seasoning. In order to jurn beans, you need five things. Those things are beans, denim, water, feet, and time.\n\nStep 1: Beans. Get yourself five pounds of navy, black or (in a pinch) pinto beans and seven gallons of sewer water.\n\nStep 2: Denim. Pants are, of course, the preferred type of denim, but you can use a shirt or jacket if that's all you have lying around. Get two five gallon buckets. Split the water, beans and denim evenly between the two buckets. Then with one foot in each bucket proceed to mix everything together by stepping up and down. This process can take quite a while, so you may want to get a friend or two. The more people that have their feet in your jurned beans, the more depth there is to the flavor profile in the end. I suggest you play around with the cleanliness of yours and your friends' feet until you find out what you like. You have to jurn your beans for six hours. Any less and you're wasting your time because it won't have that authentic flavor. That's what makes this a family recipe. I've spent many memorable hours with my family, stomping buckets of beans and jeans. Those are some of my best childhood memories.\n\nOnce you've properly jurned your beans, it's really just a matter of adding them to rice, whichever way you prefer to prepare that. I like to use the water from the jurning process to make the rice. Keeps all the flavors together. Once you have everything made you can serve it all on a platter made from any leftover denim you may have laying around.\n\nThat's it! I'm glad to have the opportunity to share this entirely made up recipe with everybody. I'm tryping this on mobile, and I've had a few beers. So, please forgive any grammatical transgressions. Also, if you've read this far, thank you for indulging my silliness, I'm done now. Byeeeeee!\n\nEdit: my first platinum. Thank you! Grandma would be proud that her recipe has inspired such friendliness!",

He just arrived not too long ago in 94 and was part of a 7 man team from China designated to start up the North America division of a real estate/construction firm.  One of the projects required him to visit Harlem and check out a building.  Everything was pretty good but it was pretty late so he decided to stay the night there.\n\nHe had his car parked on the street over night.  Next morning he wakes up to find his car on cinder blocks.  As he's trying to figure out what the hell he should do, these 2 dudes come down the street with his tires on their shoulder and says to him \"Hey bud, you need to buy some tires?\"\n\nLooking back at it, it was hilarious at the situation he got caught in.  But at the moment I'm pretty sure my dad was scared shitless being a Chinese dude in his early 30s alone in Harlem in this situation.  He paid the guys for his tires back and at least they got everything set for him but he said that was the last time they ever looked at the property there.",

He's risen up the ranks quite a bit now but all I remember is that his projects involved like NJ, Flushing, North Carolina, and they eventually expanded the office to include all of the Americas so he had a project in the Bahamas too (Bahamar Resort I think).  I know for a fact since I was 10 to now late 20s, he has never taken another project in Harlem even after the stigma sort of died down.  Only time I've seen him talk about Harlem for work was the office that Bill Clinton eventually got there since his company had a bid on the building but didn't get it.",

The seedy subway environment, created by those who don't appreciate what they have...the demeanor of the riders on the right, for whom it's just another day...compared to a young man, newly arrived, sitting alone and looking into a world of hopes, possibilities and plans for his future.  His somewhat dreamy expression, the gentle way he's holding his hands, and his forward posture add so much.  I would hang this picture on my wall, even not knowing your dad!\n\nOf course, if you ask your dad what he was thinking, he'll probably say he wanted to get out of there, or that he was hungry and thinking of lunch!

Some due to choice and some due to economic imbalance of races. What you ended up with was still black people and white people living separately and white and black neighborhoods having entirely different levels of services provided to them.\n\nA lot of that lives on today. Even looking at Washington DC. The suburban professionals all have great services, schools, and expensive homes which disallow poorer individuals from participating. The born local black population inside DC have a completely different level of schools and other services. There is no law of segregation. But the outcome of this system is segregstion unless all races start on an even playing field. And due to literal legalized racism of say 40-60 years ago, there was no even start.",

The one army is holding American flags, the other army is holding a white flag. \n\nThe implication, if you lack a thorough caption description, is the british are surrendering. This is also what the caption stated was going on.\n\nHowever, what it conveniently leaves out is that the army with the white flag was not surrendering, but rather this was the French military which had aided the USA in it's fight for independence by quite a bit. The French military just happened to utilize a pure white flag at the time, which is probably where all the jokes about the french surrendering come from. So while it is indeed a British commander discussing terms of surrender in the middle, he's discussing it with US *and* French generals, and I always felt like the history book conveniently just didn't mention the french around that portion of the book with the picture, knowing full well students would assume the french army was the british army surrendering.",

Today we call it \"mob justice\" except the \"justice\" was what white men felt was racial justice because they were parading around the idea that black men were violent criminals who were likely to kill people or rape white women at any time because clearly a white woman wouldn't consent to sex with a black man (obviously they did though). It's one of the violent, disgusting, and cowardly ways to kill someone I've ever heard of. If you have the stomach for it look up The People's Grocery Lynching. Also Ida B Wells was a pioneer of reporting in these events so look her up too if you want to know more.",

I went home and I think an hour or two later I went to the local Walgreens to buy some cold pills to help her.  Well I'm in there looking at what brand to get for her when 6 cops sneak up behind me, with no warning and one hits me in the back of the head and I go down.  They continue to beat on me while handcuffing while yelling, \"STOP RESISTING\" when I was literally curled up in a ball on the floor.\n\nAt the end of all of this they principal was yelling at them that I was excused and all they had to do was call to find all of this out.  They said, \"We will let him off easy this time.\" and the principal was yelling asking for his name and badge number and they didn't answer and left.\n\nKeep in mind I'm white and I can imagine if my hue would have been darker I would have got a \"swimming lesson\" on the other side of the levee.",

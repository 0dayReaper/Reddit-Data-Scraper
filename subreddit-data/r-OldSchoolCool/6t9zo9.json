In the Second World War, the soldiers of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the American 101st Airborne Division were marked with the spades symbol painted on the sides of their helmets. In this capacity, it was used to represent good luck, due to its fortunate connotations in card playing. All four card suits were used for ease of identification of regiments within the airborne division following the confusion of a large scale combat airborne operation.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24",

He also killed 2 German soldiers for a portable stove which he still has in his house. (don't have pics of that)\n\nFinal edit: I saw my grandpa today and he has confirmed that it's not him. Oh well he said he was always missing the camera guy.",

Before his unit was sent over to Britain he came down with tuberculosis and spent the better part of the next year and a half in hospital thinking he was going to die having never seen the enemy. That's where he met my grandmother (called her nana). She was a nurse and they fell in love. Had six children, three boys and three girls, of whom my mom was one. \nHe was the most gentle person you'd ever hope to meet. He thanked god everyday for letting him live and he treated everyone in his life with respect and caring.\nA lot of his friends from his army days didn't come back and I think he had survivors guilt. He dealt with this by trying to be a good person and lead a good life. Provide for his family and friends, and hate the fuck out of Germans and Germany. I mean he truly hated them. As powerful a hatred as any one man could muster. \nOne day his youngest daughter (my aunt) brings home her boyfriend. He was a nice boy who got along great with the family. My papa took a liking to him. It wasn't until later that he found out that my aunt's boyfriend's parents had immigrated from Germany after WWII and that his father had served in the Wermacht. This didn't sit well with my papa and he banned him from the house. \nYears later and my aunt is engaged to that boyfriend. When she went home to tell my nana and papa she was expecting a huge fight. But my papa sat silently for a moment and said, \"ok, better have him over for supper\" \nWhen asked why he suddenly changed his mind about my now uncle he said, \"When your daughters start marrying them, it's time to stop hating them\"",

The shit he saw and was forced to do fucked him up so much he became an alcoholic. My great grandmother's \"Deutchen Mutter\" medal is also in perfect condition because she just dumped it in a drawer somewhere, not proud that her husband was forced to go and fight in a war she didn't want.

It's just a doctrine based on deception used by forces way smaller than their opponent to win using attrition and concentrated attacks.

They had a small force of 82 men that was reduced to 20 after an attack following their arrival on Cuba, but managed to win the war eventually. I have searched an I saw no mention of civilian casualties anywhere. ",

People love to talk about Von Braun, but they forget that the murricans had Goddard, Truax, and were launching experimental liquid-fuel rockets since the 30's. The difference is that the germans deployed their prototypes to the field out of desperation, and the americans didn't. Von Braun came to America more as a replacement for Goddard, that died in 1945, than as this game-changer people paint him as.\n\nAnd about human experimentation, most of the results were like unit 731. Loose details and truisms like \"giving people typhus kills them\". Still, the american government didn't know that at the time, and was racing with the soviets for scavenging rights over Germany. They grabbed whatever they could just in case any of it was valuable. Turned out it was a bit underwhelming.",

Maybe he would have been remembered better if he had lived longer and been able to atone for what had happened. It's weird that all this was started by outrage over people defending a statue of him, given that Lee himself condemned the same 'Southern pride' that drove former Confederates to want to continue to rebel against the U.S. and drives the scum defending the Confederate cause today.",

Some proudly show off the Luger or other war trophies their Grandpa brought back home.\n\nThen, they go around quoting Hitler, seig heiling each other or some other stupid shit.  Like how dafuq do you idolize the Americans who fought the Nazis, then basically go around being a Nazi, supporting the ideology and group of people who killed thousands of the Americans you so admire?  Who quite possibly even killed members of your own family during the war?  \n\nEdit:  thank you for the gold, mystery patron!\n\nEdit 2:  Stop blowing up my inbox.  \"White supremacist alt-right\" as in the faction of that movement who are literally white supremacists.  Not saying all of you are these racist idiots.  I actually agree with some of the few disgruntled Libertarians thrown in there.  That all said, the word \"alt-right\" as we know it was coined in 2010 by Richard Spencer, an openly avowed white supremacist and leader in the movement.  He hates Jews.  He quotes Nazi propaganda.  He likes \"hailing\" things.  And he only wants just a little peaceful ethnic cleansing so a white ethnic state can be made in the US, a part of a bigger racial empire.  Why does this sound so familiar...  \n\nLadies though, he hasn't forgotten about you!  He is 100% pro-abortion and a woman's right to choose, but only so less Blacks and Hispanics are born.",

When my wife pointed out that that was racist, this person said, \"It's not racist, it's funny.\" I don't believe this person wants to harm Asians in any way, but they still saw this little girl as a punch line, not a person, because of the color of her hair and the shape of her face. \n\nRacists don't see themselves as racists. They have all kinds of motivations. And they are all equally shit. Fuck those people. \n\nEdit: clarity. \n\nEdit 2: There are contexts where racial humor is acceptable. The problem happens when people are reduced to stereotypes. This person didn't say \"I hope that girl doesn't get bitten by a stray cat.\" He didn't say \"That girl is about your son's age. Do they know each other?\" He thought \"lol an Asian with a cat\" and thought that was funny enough to repeat to me. \n\nThis particular situation is low-risk, but I don't believe that type of stereotypical thinking is constrained to this one scenario. If this person interviews an Asian woman for a job that requires driving a truck, is he going to take her application seriously, or is he going to think \"lol Asians and women can't drive\" and forget everything she actually says in the interview? I can't truly know the answer unless that happens and he tells me about it, but I have a pretty good guess. \n\nThe second edit is because some people commented that jokes about Asians eating cats are either not racist or not a big deal, so I'm explaining why I think it's problematic in this scenario.

Just like I know women who turned into man-haters after being assaulted multiple times. It's a natural self-defense reaction and it's sad :(\n\nFun anecdote, my living grandfather is very racist and when I got married I asked my parents \"Does grandpa also hate Asians?\" and they replied \"Don't worry, he hates everyone\". He also drives his car without shifting gear, always screeching and shaking in gear 1. :) ",

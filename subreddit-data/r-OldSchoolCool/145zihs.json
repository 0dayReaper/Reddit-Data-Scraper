Some of the heavier plus sized women being passed off as beautiful by the entertainment industry are good examples of such \"beauty\".\n\nReal beauty is like that beautiful woman who walks into a room and briefly everybody's breath is taken away. Like driving in the hills one morning , you take a turn and suddenly you get your first glimpse of the forests covered in mist in the low morning sun. Real beauty doesn't need your imagination or good intentions to help it along. You cannot hide it. I can prove it by simply measuring your heart rate and your breathing.\n\nEdit: It is possible you find a person beautiful because of reasons that are not physical. Kindness, confidence or wit for example. But Freddie sitting on Vader? Maybe say you were dying of thirst in the desert and Freddie shows up sitting on Vader's shoulders. They give you a nice cool beverage, get you hydrated and haul you off to safety... Then yes, it would be a beautiful sight for you and for the rest of your life your heart will race and you will take a deep breath whenever you see these two.",

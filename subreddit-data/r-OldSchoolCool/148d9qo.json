These people we are seeing are in the upper class of the society, and the lower classes were quite poor.\n\nThis is not to say there's anything wrong with these people we are seeing, but perhaps if the upper-class of society did more to reach down to help the less well off people, maybe the revolution could have gone a different way and instead of it being an Islamic revolution, it could have been a more conventional one.",

Photos like these are useful only to Westerners, in a Western political context for Western political purposes.  Nowadays it's just libs passing these photos around when women's rights are under attack. It used to be neocons using them to justify islamophobia and the war on terror.\n\nThe photo itself tells you next to nothing about the historical reality of Iran, but actually learning about why the Iranian revolution happened is not the goal. This photo does not tell you, for example, the number of people murdered by the SAVAK for opposing the dictatorship that made this Western lifestyle available to only a few.  The goal is to advance a Western political cause.  Most people are going to click and then move on, and then the photo has done its job.",

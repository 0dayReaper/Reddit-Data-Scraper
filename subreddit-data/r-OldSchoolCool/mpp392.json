The wards and communal care centers were done away with, and here we are now. Rampant homelessness, craZy Ethel screaming at an overgrown pig on Reddit, bunches of opiod addicted folks being paid off by a company that was sued in federal court and is paying the fine by.... selling...more.......opiates....and people who truly need psych help are let to their own devices, drug and or alcohol abusers and homelessness seems rampant. In the 70s through the 00s we shunned and dismissed them, now look at us....we fucked it up. We missed it.",

We have criminalized being mentally ill and homeless. We can't truly help people until we get over our inclination to punish people who do things we might not understand or agree with. The fact that we lock people in cages for cultivating a plant and consuming it is fucking insane and archaic. Opiates are not the problem. People selling opiates are not the problem. Criminalization of selling and using drugs is the biggest scam pulled on \"free\" people and most accept it blindly as a good thing. Drugs bad, 100 billion dollar rehab industry good.

We take chronically homeless guys off the street (I mean they accept the help first through street outreach obviously) and then put them in a subsidized apartment and give them intensive case management. We work with some seriously ill people, but we still don\u2019t turn them back onto the street. I got an email over the weekend about a client who got drunk and climbed onto the roof and started yelling at people, but were still not going to kick him out of the program. Just move him to a better location where kids aren\u2019t living and he doesn\u2019t have access to a roof. Pretty much, we exhaust every single option we have before we transfer them to a higher level of care. Unless someone leaves our program to go back to the streets, we never send them back there. This is only ONE housing program of many that are evidence based that are way, way more effective than institutionalization.",

I worked in a psychiatric hospital for 6 years which gave insight on what psych treatment looks like for people diagnosed with bipolar I and schizophrenia who don\u2019t have good support... a lot of these people come in on legal holds due to psychosis that gets them 911 attention. Then after we get them stabilized on meds to the point they are able to care for their basic needs, we are forced to discharge them. Insurance only pays for *acute* inpatient treatment treatment (as well as ongoing outpatient treatment) which we can only justify for 5-7 days Max. However they\u2019re not always in the right state or sometimes just not responsible enough to fill their prescriptions and take their meds daily as prescribed, that\u2019s if they don\u2019t sell them, much less go to their follow up appointments. These are the people that end up right back at our doors less than 6 weeks later. Now that I work at the jail as a nurse I see where they spend those 6 weeks- in and out of jail on \u201ctrespassing\u201d or \u201cblocking sidewalk\u201d charges. If we had asylums- i am aware of the negative connotations associated- these people would at least have somewhere safe to stay where they can be stable on meds with regular therapy and live a somewhat normal life.\n\nETA: cleared up the part about what insurance pays for",

They're basically studio apartments with what is supposed to be regular check ups to make sure the residents are getting the care they need.\n\nThe problem is there are too many homeless that need this service, and too few social workers.\n\nSo the check-ups don't happen nearly often enough, and sometimes a person will completely destroy a unit within a short amount of time of moving in. Shitting on everything, ripping wires out of the walls (presumably for the copper), tearing apart and throwing basically anything not bolted down.\n\nSo yeah, I agree with you. There are quite a few homeless that just need an address and safe place to get back on their feet. But there are those that can't function in society anymore.\n\nAt least with a care facility they could potentially get better. Some of them just need time to rehab and get their heads straight. And if done right would be a hell of a lot more humane than jail.",

Their treatment was basically shackling them.  Enter Dorothea Dix, a mental health advocate, who thought this should be reformed.  She believed they needed a place where they could actually be cared for.  Thomas Kirkbride designed those first mental hospitals.  He believed in moral treatment of the mentally ill.  As well as environmental determinism, the belief that your physical environment will affect your psychological one.  His hospitals had large amounts of fresh air, light, privacy, and monitored freedom indoors and outdoors.  However, regular Americans don\u2019t like paying for \u201cinsane people\u201d and at first facilities like these were just overcrowded.  JFK was going to make a mental health network, but it never happened due to his assassination.  Medicaid and Medicare came in the 1960\u2019s and states discharged mental patients anywhere they could so the federal government, and not the local government, would have to foot the bill. Reagan (as governor of California) cuts mental health funding even more because the number of patients had declined and it \u201cwasn\u2019t needed\u201d. Then Reagan passed a law against institutionalize government patients, so they could get care from the state.  But because funding had been cut, the care they received was awful.  The amount of mentally ill in the criminal justice system doubles.  As funding lessened and lessened, mental hospitals became the nightmares that you are likely alluding to.  In 1980, Carter signed a Mental Health Systems Act to provide grant money to aid mental institutions.  Then, Reagan (as president) repealed it in 1981 and reduced federal funding pushing mental healthcare back on the states.  For some reason, Reagan seemingly hated the mental ill and he broke the system to be able to stop paying for it.  The mentally ill now make up at least 10% of all prison inmates and over 50% of all homeless people.\n\nWe need to do better for our citizens mental health.  If the pandemic has proved anything, it\u2019s that EVERYONE isn\u2019t doing as well as they think they are and could always use some help.",

It was obviously trashed from hundreds of people trying to use it and they tore it down within a few months. We are truly fucked.",

I think our federal reps should demand legislation that allows CA to get federal money to care for homeless that come from outside of CA or pass federal homeless legislation. Either that or we start suing other states for the practice. \n\nWe can't simply bus them back or no homeless will ever come to our shelters so we'll be at square one again.\n\nIt would require reforming mental health and law enforcement but we need to do that anyways. \n\nIt's untenable now and it's completely BS to pay for services and not get them. Our state is unable or unwilling to make our streets safe and clean for us yet demand taxation to do just that.",

When a Microphone makes this is called self noise, and if the recorder makes the hiss it's call noise floor. The less hiss all the items in line make,  the better.  So a great mic has almost no self noise,  and the. A great recorder does the same, and your stereo even has to be good to not have it. So great mics are designed and scrutinized for perfection.\n\nSonic reaponse is how the mic responds to frequencies. Perfect would mean that all frequencies register the same volume on a mic, that doesn't exist,  but we can get close. You can even get 2 mics that are matched, meaning they hear frequencies almost exactly the same. Some mics respond better to low or mids, some highs,  and we use them in different scenarios.\n\nAnd SPL means sound pressure level, that's literally how strong the aound wave is, aka loud. When the sound level js too high you can \"clip\" the audio. This means you've actually clipped off the top and bottom of the wave because it's too big, but it doesn't mean the sound itself is too loud.  You can clip audio in a few ways - at the microphone if it's too loud then the mic soundslike shit, Clip the preamp (the thing that turns electric wavs into sound waves), or clip your amplifier ( put too much sound in even if your amp is turned down.) Every mic lists its SPL capability and you go from there.",

Like \u201csure there are all of these sad things happening all around you, daily anxiety to deal with, uphill battles, work, etc. \u2026 but it\u2019s going to be ok. I\u2019ve got you\u201d",

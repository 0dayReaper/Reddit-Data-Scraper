Only right this moment do I realize that the riots I remember as a child were likely the riots talked about in the song.\n\nWe lived in a neighborhood a few miles away from the neighborhoods that were burning. I remember my parents had this frantic energy about them, trying to keep cool, but it was obvious something was wrong. My mother wouldn't turn on the TV. I was allowed to go out and play, but I couldn't leave our yard. There weren't any other kids to play with outside. For days, when the wind blew our way, white and grey ashes rained down from the sky like snowflakes. I played a game pretending it was real snowflakes, because I'd never seen snow and I wished it was snow instead of ashes.\n\nFor several weeks after the burning stopped, my mom still wouldn't turn on the TV. She would drive out of our way so we wouldn't pass the places that had been burned and looted. It wasn't that she was scared of those places, but because she didn't want my brother and I to see it. \n\nIt was months before I saw the effects of the riots. By then people would just walk by the boarded up shops like nothing had happened, so it seemed normal to me. Life went on.\n\nStarting in April of 1992, though, the knowledge that something like those riots could happen was in my world. You can't un-know that experience or un-think those thoughts. I think that's why I was attracted so strongly to messages of unity and nonviolence. I had lived in a multiracial community my whole life, so I knew people could live together and get along. I just wanted everyone to be friends.\n\nIn April of 1992, I was five.",

The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24",

I'm seeing a kid who seems like they would be a sweet person, but I know because of their parents rhetoric they will lose out on so many wonderful connections in their life.\n\nIt's such a gradual process. Kids repeat what they been told to them without filling understanding the meaning. They have a irrationally fear of groups instilled into them. And they falsely repeat historical events and situations to you, because they think why would a love one lie to them.\n\nThen it's like a tipping point. I hope they will meet the person or have that experience before it's too late. Because if it doesn't happen they become there parents teaching hate to their future kids.",

The photographer guessed their origins to be Gainesville. Could someone find this kid today and see how he turned out? A 26-year-old Josh from Gainesville.\n\nEdit: http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2013-01-22/trooper-famous-photo-just-wished-he-were-somewhere-else\n\nAccording to this source he was 3-years-old. So he'd be about 28 now. \n\nEdit 2:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Georgia\n\nGainesville has a population of roughly 40,000. 54% are white. So close to 20,000 are white. If about 50% are women... that's now 10,000. Less than 30% of those men are in the right age range. That leaves a pool of 3300 people. How many of those are named Josh? It's all assuming he's really from and still living in Gainesville though. (Note math is not my strong suit so feel free to correct me.) ",

No.\n\nDecent jobs?  These people were the type of people that actually lost jobs to illegal immigrants in the early 2000s, so no.\n\nFinancial wealth or even stability? No.\n\nDecent family structures?  They were manufacturing and selling meth to the extent that at one point this little bumfuck community was pulling one meth lab explosion a week, so no.\n\nBy the time I was 12, my Mom had fortunately divorced and cut both men out of her life, and I had been given a more liberal upbringing.  Our family also gained a disdain for religion in lieu of its tendency to congregate and amplify such scumbaggery.  ",

So many hot button topics captured in one image.\n The expressions of the officers to me look disappointed or disheartened and that is what breaks my heart.

One must wonder what could have been had he chose to focus on a single sport.\n\nThat said, I seem to remember reading a report indicating that his career-ending injury wasn't an accident, per se; yes, he was tripped up, but that's not uncommon, but rather, his hip fracture was a product of his own exceptional muscular strength.",

He also covered a lot of ground in LF with his speed. \n\nHis counting stats as a RB in the NFL were never going to be high because he played baseball until the end of September. He also split time between Marcus Allen, not because of talent but out of spite from the owner who feuded with Marcus Allen seemingly all the time.

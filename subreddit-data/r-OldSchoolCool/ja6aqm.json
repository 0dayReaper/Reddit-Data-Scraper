I recall doing this exact kind of double exposure in my high school photo class back in the early 90s.  We used a black sheet, locked the camera down on a tripod to eliminate camera movement and make it easier to frame the image, and created the double exposure on the negative.  I think that would have been easier than perfectly blending the two halves in the darkroom.",

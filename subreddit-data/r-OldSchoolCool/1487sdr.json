Chicago has a deep history of architecture and city planning - specifically the 1890 worlds fair and the Chicago fire which destroyed a lot of the city - together allowed Chicago to bring in world class architecture from around the world, set the city into a Jeffersonian grid, and allowed it to take better advantage of the lake and river. You have famous architects here - Sullivan, frank lloyd write, mies van de rhoe, etc. \nIt\u2019s uniqueness made it iconic through its portrayal in media and art.\n3. Chicago has done an amazing job activating public space and respecting pedestrian traffic in the last 2 decades. While much of America is car centric, chicago is one of the few cities that has great public transit and great pedestrian walkways and parks. \nWhile I think it\u2019s hard to beat NY in many categories - Chicago is one of the most beautiful American \u201cbig cities\u201d (cleaner than NY) lots of skyscrapers, and the Lake Michigan is basically an ocean with beaches. Winter sucks, but they say you can\u2019t beat summer in Chicago.\n\nE: there\u2019s a lot more to the city! But that\u2019s what came to mind first. Lots of art!",

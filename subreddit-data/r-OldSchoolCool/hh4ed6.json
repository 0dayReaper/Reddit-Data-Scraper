Even though they\u2019d had death confirmed at start, the release of info was in stages. \n\n(That was their protocol up to around 2000, I\u2019d assume this has probably changed since, given the prevalence of rolling news)\n\nEdit - added source detail",

It hit the pillar of an underpass at over 60mph and Diana was not wearing her seatbelt (neither was Dodie).\n \nPaparazzi were taking pictures, yes, but there was little they could do to help the occupants other than phone the French equivalent of 999. When I was involved in a 60mph collision I couldn't even open my door because it was crumpled, and I couldn't get across to the other side of the car because my pelvis was crushed. God knows what damage could have been done to me if I had been unconscious and someone had thought it would be a good idea to drag me across the gear stick and handbrake and under the steering wheel and out of the other door. Or through the window of the crumpled door. When the emergency services arrived they had to cut the roof off the car and I was manoeuvred on to a back board before being taken to hospital. \n\nAt least I was wearing my seatbelt and the airbag deployed.",

Sometimes I feel like my grandmother sees me as the reincarnation of her father, because I was given his name, and I\u2019ve always gotten along very well with her. Perhaps part of it is true - I think part of our temper/personality is driven by genetics, and as a result maybe I am truly a spitting image of my great grandfather (only she can tell at this point), and perhaps that thought brings her peace.",

Fortunately i have good memories of rewatching some of them while i was still young, but id love to be able to see one now just to have half the frame blocked by his pointing and hear his old timey jokes.

They see a very moving movie and instantly go  'ahhhhh that's a good dad'.It shows  a loving dad for sure, and by the description of the OP he is, but hugging and kissing is not all that it takes to be a good dad. Showing your kids physical affection is important, but it's not the 'end all be all' thing to be a good father. A good father needs to be a example, you need to be understanding towards your kids, stern, loving, teach them skills, teach them to be a good person, and so, so much more. And as some Redditors are wrongfully pointing out- no, just worrying about being a good dad is not enough. It's fucking hard work trying to be a good dad and as fathers we will always come up short somewhere because we are fallible humans. Putting in the effort is all that we can do.\n\nIt's not as wholesome as we'd like sometimes, but life is not always wholesome.Nevertheless the video is adorable and hearth warming! Makes me miss my own father.",

So, I was very shy about having relationships myself, friends or boyfriends. However, I actually grew to like hugs, giving and receiving. I have turned into a more cuddly person, although I'm a little timid with saying stuff. Except with my husband, of course. A few years ago (I'm 39), whenever I would see my Dad, he started hugging me and saying \"Love you\". It was so surprising, and unexpected. I don't know what changed, but I'm happy it did. I remember when I first started my job. I was being taken on a tour of the building, and where I would be working. The lady that did my orientation had been there for about 20 years, and so many people greeted her as we walked around. One other woman in particular hadn't seen her in a while, so they spoke for a few minutes, and I just stood around. Then this woman gave my orientation person a big hug, looked at me and said \"I can hug him too if you like!\". I gave this woman, who I have never seen in my life a nice, squishy hug. It felt nice, and I realized how much I have changed since I was a teen.",

I can connect the dots on a lot of issues I had through my teen years into early adulthood just from how I was treated by them growing up. My daughter is 10 now and I make sure I tell her as many times a day as I possible can... literally before I came in my office just now I went in her room and kissed her head and told her I love you. It's a formed habit now. Family hugs every day and we do a 3 way kiss since she was just a little toddler. It's so important that your kid knows you're in their corner and no matter what they do there is a parent(s) that loves them. I'm telling you man, even if they make you mad and you yell at them or punish them for something, ALWAYS end with ...\"Hey, just because you made a mistake, that doesn't mean I'm mad at you or don't love you... I love you so much, we just need to be better with \"whatever issue\"\". People need constant reassurance and especially children.\n\nYou'd be surprised at the decisions in their life that will change just on that fact later down the line... especially in an era where mental health is such an issue and kids can feel isolated and alone quickly.",

He fought in the war, fought in the Pacific, was stationed in Hiro City (Hiroshima) in the occupation and died of blood cancer when my father was 18.\n\nMy father's brother was shot - they lived in Chicago and he was a bystander basically. My grandfather chided my father, in the hospital, and dying from blood cancer, about why he didn't protect his brother. My father broke down - he was the only one keeping the family together, their mother left them years before.\n\nThat was the only time my Grandfather ever told my father he loved him. He died shortly after.\n\nSome men couldn't. It didn't mean that they didn't.\n\nMy childhood, my whole life, I've always had my father gushing praise on me no matter what I did, even if I didn't deserve it. I think in a way he wanted to overcompensate for what he experienced. He's struggled with depression, I hope you'd understand why. But I always knew his love was genuine. And he was always there for me. He's still there for me and his grandkids.\n\nYou father did love you. Even if he couldn't show it. Some men couldn't.\n\nYou can break the cycle.",

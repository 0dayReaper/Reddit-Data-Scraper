People were willing to give a lot of deference to the cops, eventually too much deference.  \n\nAt the same time a lot of cops were getting killed so cops training shifted from community service to officer safety.  Which ended up being a more militarized us versus them attitude and bigger, deadlier equipment for the cops.  \n\nAlso in response lawmakers passed new laws that meant longer sentences for more crimes, it gave us civil asset forfeiture which gave cops incentive to steal, if gave us drug sniffing dogs and regular car searches, it gave us no knock warrants where cops could play with their toys.  \n\nAnd crime went down and people were happy for awhile.  But the cops still had an us versus them mentality, they still had big weapons they like to play with, they still liked to steal people's money.  But with less crime they started going after more and more everyday people and with body cameras even the people that weren't affected started to see what was going.  People realized we now had 5 times as many prisoners as we should compared to the rest of the world, that many cops are tyrants and thieves.  And people don't like it and that's where we're at now.  \n\nThat's not to say all or even most cops are bad people.  But the institution is broken and it encourages bad cops to behave badly and good cops to keep their mouths shut too often.   But I think the ACAB movement and defund police movement are taking it too far the other way.  \n\nSo I'm with you, I hope we can get back to the day where cops primary occupation is community service and that they are part of the communities they serve.",

Prison populations started to soar in the early 1970s and didn't stop until around 2006 or so.  \n\nJoe Biden played a bigger role than Reagan, as a senator all of his biggest legislative accomplishments in the 80s and 90s were about more power to cops and harsher prison sentences.  Things like three strike laws and civil asset forfeiture. Yeah Reagan was on board, as were almost all of the republicans and democrats of the time.  \n\nTo lay the blame at the feet of Reagan you have to ignore the period between 1972 and 1981.  And you have to ignore that the harshest crime bills were passed in the 1990s under the Clinton administration.   \n\nThe modern 1033 program where the federal government gives cops military equipment started after Reagan under Bush in 1990 and expanded under Clinton in 1997.",

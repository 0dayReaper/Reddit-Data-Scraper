I have similar questions to you but I think there might be a combination of some misperceptions and misleading storytelling.\n\nThe key is drifts. It's possible for snow to be very very deep in some places and much much less deep in others. Snow can collect around objects too, so the street could have less snow even while the wind piles it up on a line of parked cars, or a house.\n\nThe way I imagine explaining this is that his car was buried in snow, and he used a yardstick to move the snow to look at the car roof, but it wasn't like he was poking the stick down through the snow he was walking on, it was like he was swiping a foot of snow off the top of the car, standing on the side, to see the color of the car. Or if he was walking on a drift, the cars themselves were along the edge of the drift, so there was much less snow off to one side than the other (although in that case I don't know why he wouldn't check the cars on the snow-less side). \n\nAt home, similarly, it might have been possible to reach the roof from one side of the house but not at all the other. That and/or maybe the driveway was really short or something.\n\nOr the story is a tall tale. ",

How many cars did he start to shovel out before he realized he was at the wrong car? And with that much snow let\u2019s just say there was 6 ft of snow. This guy then shoveled a path wide enough for a car, through six feet of snow? What is the timeline of this story? Like a week? That is an ungodly amount of snow to shovel.\n\nNot discrediting OPs story, clearly the state got that much snow. But shoveling a driveway with 10 inches of snow can be back breaking labor. How in the world does one guy shovel 6 ft in a timely manner?",

Then you get to the end and get to the 1998 part and realize it was all a lie. It got to the point where people were actively paranoid when they started reading any thrilling comment that you'd have to stop and go to the bottom to make sure you weren't being tricked. But before the paranoia kicked in he'd get you like 147 times. It was super annoying. I don't see him as much anymore I'm guessing because people started getting so paranoid that they'd catch it and it wasn't as effective. I used to get tricked a few times a day. \n\nIt's really interesting when you think about it. He basically trained all of us to check every single exciting comment.

However, the snow was also dense enough that he could walk across the top in the parking lot and to get to the roof? \n\nSo he personally moved 6+ vertical feet of snow and 5ish (?) feet horizontally to make a path from the parking lot to the road, and then did it again in the driveway?",

DC doesn't get big snowstorms often enough to invest in serious equipment, so they can't remotely handle a storm of that size.\n\nThe first one was right before winter break, so we got 3 extra days off before break started. But the second one in February was insane. The forecast was so bad that they closed school preemptively the Thursday it hit, even though it didn't end up having any serious accumulation until late that night. We ended up getting Friday and *the entire next week* off of school. I was having a particularly miserable time with school that year, and this snowstorm was the greatest relief of my life.\n\nWe had a repeat in my 20s living downtown instead of in the suburbs, and it was just as surreal. Everyone got off of work for a few days, and I hiked 2 miles or so down the middle of Massachusetts Ave (one of the biggest arteries in the city) to get brunch with friends at the one place that was open. There were no cars out and just a couple small groups of people heading to the Capitol to go sledding. Felt like the city was abandoned after the apocalypse.\n\nMan I miss snow.",

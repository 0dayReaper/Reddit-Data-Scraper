He was 8 years older than (born 1973, me 1981), and he was into everything, but I remember always going into his room and reading the names of the bands and the albums and daydreaming about them.  I clearly remember seeing Anthrax, Ministry, Oingo Boingo, Depeche Mode, INXS, etc, but what always caught my eye every single time was one of his tapes by Primus, called Pork Soda, and I thought that was just the craziest name for an album as a kid.  \n\nWhen I made it to middle school, Primus released \u201cTales From The Punchbowl\u201d and I discovered Wynona\u2019s Big Brown Beaver.  Instant Primus fan.  Primus Sucks!\n\nEdit:  funnily enough, it wasn\u2019t until I was a full-blown adult that I discovered INXS wasn\u2019t pronounced \u201cink-ses\u201d",

The interesting thing about Primus is that they're a 3 piece band where the lead instrument is the bass, the guitar is a compliment to the bass as opposed to the other way around, and the drums are aggressive but complimentary of both. Primus is goofy on the face of it but has a horrible darkness lurking just below the surface of everything they do. A very interesting dichotomy within this band, and if you listen long enough to understand the musicianship of what they're doing, they're quite possibly the tightest sounding 3 piece band since Rush. On top of all that, they don't play anything that sounds like anyone else. \n\nIf you're not completely put of Primus, I'd start with antipop. It's a bit more \"mainstream\" sounding than most of their other stuff. Any die hard Primus fan will yell at me because \"you don't get a good sense of who Primus is from the antipop album\" but it'll sort of ease you in without beating you in the head with the weirder stuff like Frizzle Fry and Sailing The Seas Of Cheese.",

Mr. Bill begat Samurai Night Fever begat Chee'burger! begat the Land Shark and I've been hooked ever since. I think the show is still relevant and funny today. People forget in every era of SNL, there were just as many sketches that missed as those that hit. I think the ones that hit back in the day were just more memorable. Lately the hit/miss ratio seems to skew more miss these days, but Weekend Update still offers the most consistent laughs, imo. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/begkr0g0jg5b1.gif",

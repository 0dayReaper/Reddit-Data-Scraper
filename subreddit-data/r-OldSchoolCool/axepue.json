But it gives a much deeper look at Vulcan in general and Spock's family and background in general. Since it was animated, they could do a lot that they couldn't do in the live-action series--but on the other hand, it was a 30-minute show, which limited them. The novelizations of the animated series actually did the stories real justice and made them lengthier and deeper: I may be remembering the story format as much as the animated episode.",

Looking at it as a grown-up, it can be hard to see past the wooden animation and odd color palette by the color blind art director. Pink Klingon uniforms would make the most ardent fan start to ask some questions. The voice direction also didn't have much flair, and having James Doohan and Majel Barrett do most of the guest voices can be tedious.\n\nThat being said, the stories are fantastic, especially the ones from DC Fontana and other TOS alums. They could also do stuff that they didn't have the budget for in live action. The two alien helmsmen would have been way too expensive up until the Discovery budget.",

It would definitely still be talked about today, but probably in a more historical light like how people talk about other early science fiction and the OG Twilight Zone today.",

The second, written twenty years later in 1995, was titled *I Am Spock*.\n\nIt must be a weird thing, being an actor who is widely known for a single very specific but culturally important role. Imagine feeling that a character you portray will outlive you and is more important than you are as a person. It'd be strange. I think embracing it is all you can do though and is the right attitude to have.",

The Vulcan nerve pinch was originally supposed to be the Vulcan Sucker punch. It was supposed to be a regular lunch to the face, but I imagine Spock would have gotten up from sitting, as he walked closer to his unfortunate fo, he would be fixing his pants/tightening his belt.... and while still walking, Spock would have wound up, and straight up clocked/Molly-wopped the guy in the face.\n\nHowever, Leonard Nimoy is Leonard Nimoy... and although Spock is only half Vulcan, Nimoy thought a sucker punch would be too barbaric for such a logical/calculated species (Vulcan), and he instead opted for the the now famous, \u201cVulcan Nerve Pinch\u201d.",

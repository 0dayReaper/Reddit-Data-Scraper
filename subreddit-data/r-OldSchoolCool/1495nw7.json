I suspect this was rehearsed and setup during the day before shooting at night. Possibly?\n\nHe plays a lot with the light in this scene. It's shot with the sun just setting and dense filters on the lens. When she is viewed from below you can see the hard white spotlight above her mimicking the moon. Then it pans back to the boy past out on the beach with the same red sunset, but she is still being partially lit with a white spot behind her to give the water some \"depth\".  So there are some continuity issues with the lighting.",

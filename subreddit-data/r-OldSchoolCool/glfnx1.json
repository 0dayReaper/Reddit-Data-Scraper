Hell, it took me 3 weeks before I was finally able to load a bobbin right.\n\nBut the bigger barrier right now is that I can't go use a sewing machine right now and I don't think my skills are developed enough to justify buying one. Kind of like how you don't go buy a guitar off the bat, ya know?\n\nI also don't have a cutting table like I did at school, but I'm not sure how important that is. \n\nOnce quarantine is over, I want to rent a machine and see what I can do.",

Like then, they are still worn for special occasions by people willing to sew or alter their own dresses, or pay someone who can.   You need very precise custom measures to get this level of fit.   Which means that unless these dresses were custom tailored for these models, for this shoot, there are probably a bunch of pins and temporary stitches you can't see holding the fabric lines in place.",

                    "comment": "I get this, and it is kinda amusing, but it's worth noting there were more models used in the pre-qual trilogy than in the original films.\n\nLord of the Rings is a similar story, shot around the same time. Huge amounts of the films effects consist of practical models, particularly where set extensions and environments are concerned, which then have additional digital compositing done (as opposed to optical) to finish the shots off.\n\nBoth franchises had a degree of falling out between fans and key creatives as the films evolved and in my opinion this is much more attributable to the change in process of those creatives, rather than the new toys themselves.\n\nI'll use LotR as an example moving into the Hobbit because I think it's a little easier to explain and more well documented in terms of the changes. But during the filming of LotR the basic stories had to be carefully planned, the scenes were shot and the story was set. There were goals from the beginning which were clearly articulated and then people went out and Made The Film. While there was a substantial amount of recutting and some reshoots during post on LotR, there was still a Pre/Shoot/Post methodology that had to be adhered too and planned around.\n\nDuring the Hobbit films, Jackson was literally changing the script as they went. There's a famous anecdote about how one day Fran came onto set with a new change and  she didn't have costumes ready so she asked the VFX Supervisors if they could just add digital costumes later - and any VFX Supervisor will tell you how much they don't want to do that because it's a complete pain in the arse, an expensive and flawed project.\n\nBut my point is, that same request wouldn't have been made during the original trilogy. Because it wasn't an option, the people involved would have needed to really think about and plan what they did before they got into the shoot.\n\nCGI hasn't fucked films up, but it has enabled film makers and studio executives to defer planning in favour of improvisation. When you hear about Marvel changing a scene in Thor from a New York Alley to the Cliffs of Norway, and just using VFX to force it through, you shouldn't be thinking \"CGI fucked things up\" but instead \"Why did you just shoot it in Norway to begin with?\"\n\nAs an aside I think this is why people like Nolan want to shoot emulsion film. Honestly we can emulate emulsion film perfectly if we want to these days, but it forces you through a process and makes you need to plan. In doing so it sort of holds you accountable, makes you double check yourself, and that's a powerful tool for an artist.\n\n(source: am vfx person)",

                            "comment": "Just to add, virtual production is causing waves by doing a rough draft of a whole film in 3d (before shooting) using real time rendering like Unreal Engine, which Disney is doing with all their recent projects. This allows creatives to have a really detailed plan while still capturing those improv moments, so you get all your shots that you want and you can divide what real and digital assets you need. Then build everything to that plan, and even include shots using those assets you created to make the plan. This partly solves some of those issues mentioned. The worst outcome is having to reshoot something so why not figure out, lighting, cameras, and environment all before you actually shoot. This isn't something completely new as some VFX people I have talked to said that Disney was already doing something like this with a in-house tool, just it was still very crude, but Unreal was just a framework which made it much easier so they went with Unreal instead.\n\n - Engineer trying to implement Virtual Production at a film studio",

The story of Darth Vaders creation wasn't as good as it should have been, but it made sense. Revenge of the sith is a genuinely solid movie.\n\nI dunno, they deserve the jokes people make about them. But they're hardly the trash people act like they are. You watch 1-6 and you get a mostly coherent narrative with dozens of characters and a big story. \n\nYou watch 7-9, you get a remake of 4 and then utter nonsense",

Plus I think they saw the dot com bubble and got scared. Where eBay, Amazon, and Newegg opportunity to corner their respective markets after the weaker competition didn't survive, Sears probably assumed the bubble bursting meant that internet sales were a fad and nothing would come of it. The closing of blockbuster should have been a wake up call though, by that time Sears was far behind but they had some advantages such as warehouses and stores miles from most of the US population. I think the financial crisis hit Sears hard though and probably stopped them from investing in online retail. After the recovery they were already late to the game, they survived a crisis and they had no direction so they just started paying out more dividends and secretly gutting the company to make some people rich.",

The only thing I went to Sears for the last 15 years they were in business was for craftsman tools before they got outsourced because they were generally higher priced on other consumer goods than other places here. \n\nI saw a big decline in tool sales when harbor freight opened up where people could buy cheap lifetime guaranteed tools. Add to that, even though a lot of harbor freight's hand tools are garbage for someone like me who needs ruggedness and durability, they are perfectly fine for the vast majority of the population that doesn't tend to do work on their own equipment, house, etc.",

If you want to learn just take it one step at a time, pull some cable, build some walls, learn to tape/mud, apply siding, paint, etc... \n\nEventually you'll have cycled through most of the jobs required to build a house.

You may be able to build a wall just fine stacking bricks with concrete, but we've all had those times when the person who knows what they are doing walks up and says \"Oh my God you didn't do the most crucial step, this whole thing is gonna fall down\"\n\nFor me it's like cooking pasta, nobody ever taught me to cook as a kid, and as an adult I have to face it alone. I know pasta (one kind) is boiled noodles and warm fettuccine sauce, so I get a pack of noodles and a jar of sauce. I boil the noodles like how it says on the package, put the sauce in a pan, get it warm, then mix it all together. But my sauce is way too watery and and just falls to the bottom, this happens a few times until I finally discover that I have to simmer the sauce for a few minutes (and what simmer means).\n\nObviously a house is 4 walls with a roof, floor, and electrical/plumbing inside. But if someone just went to home depot, bought a bunch of wood, and went at it with no experience they would probably not do something crucial like put insolation or something.",

We don't call it \"cheap food\". And we don't call it \"terrible food\", even though *both* statements are true. We call it \"fast food\" for a **reason**: the majority of people are interested in something that saves them a *lot* of time.  \n\nI'm not sure that I would go back to eating out primarily, as my food quality has definitely improved a lot, but I definitely miss not having to spend 2 hours every day preparing meals.\n\nI actually have a lot of tools, but no cooking. :)",

It's both cheaper and healthier (depending on what you like to cook - hah). \n\n\nI will say that not every meal has to be super involved. For people short of time there's a myriad of recipes and cooking styles to fit their lifestyle. Pressure cooking and slow cooking come to mind as more \"hands off\" mediums of cooking. Aside from initial prep, these recipes are often set it and forget it. You can even automate things like preparing rice by buying a rice cooker. There's options out there for fast and/or low time investment meals. You'll start to absorb more of these recipes and methods over time. Godspeed.",

Memorizing and following recipes and amounts makes it take so much longer. \n\nStir frying, baking and slow cooking (or pressure cooking) dishes really help to cut down the time you spend in the kitchen. Baking and slow cooking lets you go off and do other things while the food gets ready. *Chopping* is what takes forever for me nowadays, and that's really only about 5-10 minutes. \n\nLearning your spice combos can be tricky, and we definitely bungled it for a little while. Watched some videos on tasty to get a sense of what goes with what and we're much better with it now. I almost never use measuring utensils or cups, that just slows me down (plus, the person I first learned from didn't even own any, they had a bunch of tricks for eyeing and tasting things and sensing what's \"right\").",

            "comment": "I live in a house built right about the same time. We bought it after the original owners passed away. Sometimes, raising a family of my own there, I just look around an think about how their little ones were born, grew up, ran down the hallways, played in their rooms, etc, until they moved away to start their own lives. A whole family's history happened inside those walls, which sometimes gets to me. When cleaning out the garage after I first moved in, I found a small collection of dog tags from dogs that they had owned over the years. Five or six in all. It all just brings into perspective how fast time goes and that, in 18 years, my kids will likely move on to start their own lives, just the same.",

With a gun on his hip in typical cowboy attire he catches them red handed and say that they are a little early but that they could go ahead and get started if they were so rarin to go. Worked them building the barn all day, and at the end actually paid them and asked when they would be there tomorrow. They ended up showing up for the next 3 days and got the whole thing built lol. \"People that are desperate enough to resort to thievin are also the most in need of an extended hand\".",

Left the hospital to smoke a cigarette, listen to one of his voicemails, and take a minute to zone out on Reddit. \n\nSeeing this makes me a little happy. Because seeing any dad when they\u2019re young and healthy and happy is a wonderful thing. \n\nYour dad looks like Andy Samberg dressed as Freddie Mercury dressed as Wierd Al. That\u2019s cool. \n\nHope your dad is doing well, wherever he may be. In this life or the next.",

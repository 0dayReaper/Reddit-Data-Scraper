When he knows what he's talking about he can definitely work a crowd and command a pretty decent amount of respect. He also has pretty good non-verbal communication. ",

Firstly: in roman antiquity all cults had to have a bust of the emperor to worship along side their diety except one, the jews. The empire respected their beliefs  of not hosting any idols before their god, as this was perhaps the most important issue in judiasm during the period. Secondly they either demanded or were forced into their own segregated communities and were allowed greater control to self govern (this continued into the 20th century as a racist way to segregation Jews into what became known as a ghetto).\n\n\nIn America the colony of new Amsterdam had a wave of antisemitism and at one point the democratically elected council passed with near unanimous support to outlaw judiasm and ban the construction of synagogues. However the city's Jews pleaded with their ancestors and relatives who lived in the Netherlands and Belgium for assistance. These European Jews happened to be stock holders in the Dutch east India corporation, the owner of the colony of new Amsterdam and the law was struck down. This is a primary example of what could be considered the root of the theory of the new world order, a Jewish cabal. When in fact the European jewry that became influential did so because they were forced into banking by European gentile kings, who did not foresee the rise of either the development of castles nor the invention of the factory. Both of which thrust money into the hands of the bankers. \n\n\n\nThis level of influence through money, more often than not,  legal but often times because of outright discrimination continued well into the 20th century. In America when universities banned Jews, wealthy Jews simply started their own. When hospitals banned Jewish doctors, Jews simply built hospitals. The ultimate example of this is of course, the creation of the nation of Israel, which is also the most morally doubious. ",

                                            "comment": "Anti-Semitism has been a hallmark of European and American nationalist, fascist, and (right and left) populist movements from the start. It's about consolidating social identity for white [Christians/Germans/Italians/Russians/Americans/etc.]. It's also about finding a scapegoat for the dissatisfaction with the capitalist system who is populous enough that they don't seem like not a threat and powerless enough that they can't fight back. \n\nIt was a matter of convenience in Europe because that was the minority they had back in the 19th century. There was already a pretty ubiquitous hatred/distrust of Jews based on religion (Christ-killers). Much of modern anti-Semitism was formulated then and transitioned from being a religious thing to an economic/identity/nationalist thing (obviously the religious aspect persisted as well). It was essentially a way to blame some outside actor for the suffering caused by industrialization and the advent of capitalism instead of actually addressing the problems. It built upon a foundation of religious hate. \n\nSo those ideas and things didn't just go away. They were sticky. They were used by the Nazis, sure, but they were also always prevalent in the United States (and every other European country). In America, this was spurred by a huge influx of European Jews in the first part of the 20th century (the Jewish population more than tripled as a share of the overall population, much like when other groups made their past exoduses to America). The lynching of Leo Frank (a potentially horrible dude, but the facts are muddled. He received a commuted sentence from the Georgia Governor, only later to be kidnapped and lynched by an angry mob) literally sparked the revival of the KKK and was used as anti-Semitic propaganda for years. \n\nThis lead to decades of propaganda, Anti-Semitic radio hours (Caughlin - the original Alex Jones), the use of Jewish ties as political ammo (see Grover Cleveland and JP Morgan Bonds, or the \"Jew Deal\"), Henry Ford's anti-semitism (imagine if Elon Musk, instead of telling us that robots are dangerous told us that Jews are dangerous and sent out a weekly that blamed all war on them), the alleged connection between Judaism and communism, anti-Jewish immigration (largely targeted at stopping Eastern European immigrants), Ivy League quotas limiting the number of Jewish attendees, etc. \n\nWWII and the civil rights movement made anti-Semitism go underground, in a sense, but powerful anti-Semitic people (Richard Nixon) and lobbies (like the one that limited holocaust refugees, or the Liberty Lobby) were still prevalent. \n\nReally, the anti-Semitism today is an echo of the early 20th century, a return to form for a generation that never experienced the Holocaust and had very few survivors alive to tell their stories. It's stoked by the resentment people in capitalist systems feel when the system doesn't give them the promised prosperity. It's stoked by isolationists who blame the world for the problems the US faces. It's stoked by religious people who see other religions as the enemy. It's stoked by racism, hate, and jealousy. It's stoked by ignorance most of all. ",

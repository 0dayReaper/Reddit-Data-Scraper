But, in this case, the dance-off scene *is* a parody... and a well-known one, at that. At least for people who were of a certain age in the US at the time.\n\nI don't know your age or geography, but dance-offs were a big deal. They often veered into the realm of ridiculousness, even when it was supposed to be serious and NOT a parody. \n\nThe over-the-top dance-off is one thing, but the Wayans brothers took it two steps further. The added dimension of it being 80-something grandmas dancing like young adults, and using obvious body doubles that they didn't even TRY to hide, make for a scene that is beyond funny.\n\nThis scene is not a parody of Grandmas dancing, but a comment on dance-offs in general... their prevalence AND their ridiculousness.\n\nIt used to be a big joke that people started settling things with a dance-off, kind of like a modern-day duel.\n\nThis movie is not the only one that parodied the dance-off phenomenon. One example I remember was somebody settling a murder trial with a dance-off. It was I'm a jokey tiebreaker for all things, big and small\u2014and the bigger, the funnier.",

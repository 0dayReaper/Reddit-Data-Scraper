And the reason it was burned down in the end was the fact that a ticket was upwards of $160, they wouldn\u2019t let you bring food or water in and the vendors were allowed to charge $4 for a small bottle of water.   Cheapest thing to eat was a personal Dominos pizza for $12.  Don\u2019t let the docs fool you that it had something to do with some toxic masculinity.  It was the 3 days of corporate fucking that everyone was sick of .",

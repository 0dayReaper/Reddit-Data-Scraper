Her tour stopped by my city this weekend and it was all the local news had to report on it seemed.

Couldn't avoid her from about Wednesday (3 days before the 2 sold out shows) until last night and they're still talking about show 2 this very minute. \n\nEven with all that I just told you about plus whatever I missed, that's not even 1/10th of what Michael would do. I saw grown women go catatonic when I saw him live. Teens were routinely brought out of crowds on stretchers from passing out BEFORE his shows. Just the mere thought of seeing Michael live caused people to hyperventilate. \n\nTaylor had a cute little convoy come through town before her show. 2-3 SUVs and a cop or two. Michael had a god damn state police escort reserved for dignitaries. We all thought he was gonna bring about world peace at one point.",

Cable TV channels barely mattered yet.  (_All_ cable channels added together still had lower ratings than the main broadcast networks.)  Video games weren't very important yet.\n\nThere were just far fewer categories of \"famousness\" competing with the cultural currency of the music industry.

Even though it only morphed between human faces infrequently, it was shot in extremely high definition, with non trivial backgrounds, moving cameras, and what we call \"noise.\" (Background actors, traffic, etc)\n\nThey also had more money of course, and not to take anything away from B&amp;W, but T2 was a far harder problem than just face tracking, white background and no clothes.\n\nSource: me. CGI for film/TV was my old industry.",

That's not even the most impressive early generation CGI for film.\n\nProbably one of the best examples of how long things took back then was the intro scene to the movie Contact. If you haven't seen it it tracks the radio signal noise coming out of Earth, all the way out into the universe. So it starts in Earth orbit and then does a slow pull out until the viewer is suddenly outside of the Milky Way looking in. It's incredibly impressive if you haven't seen it.\n\nTo generate that scene back in the day took months and months and months of dozens of servers running 24 hours a day 7 days a week. At SIGgraph that year the team that did that opening was passing out t-shirts that had all the stats. (I'm trying to do a search for it now but I can't seem to find it)\n\n*Edit: still looking on the web for that t-shirt. It was pretty impressive, hope I can find it. *",

It\u2019s like the way a river begins to meander over time: you do your regular trimming/sculpting during your daily ablutions, and every time you are unwittingly \u201ceroding\u201d the edge on one side, in small, hard-to-see amounts, because of a combination of factors. Maybe your dominant eye is your left, and your dominant hand is your right, and you\u2019re not terribly ambidextrous\\*. Maybe your left wrist had a slightly different range of motion than your right, from a lifetime of sprains and broken bones. And over time, that \u201cerosion\u201d on one side of a patch of whiskers has to be counteracted on the other, so the thickness of that section remains consistent with the other side. But the river meanders, as it were. \n\n\\* this was my situation. I wore a goatee in college, and one day I looked in the mirror a few years after I started growing it. It was absolutely centered the first time I shaved the sides. And one day the entire thing was about a quarter-inch shifted to the left. And this is just from shaving the borders on the sides. I can\u2019t imagine how much drift I\u2019d have had if I were one of those dudes who manicures his facial hair into thinner lines than the follicles are capable of. It\u2019d be all squiggly lines after a couple years. \ud83d\ude02",

(The opacity is inversely correlated with the distortion.)\n\nThat's the simplest version of the effect that you can make.\n\nBut there are a few ways in which it gets a lot fancier here...\n\n* This is applied on moving faces (and upper bodies), so this must have required lots of manual motion tracking, to have 2D distortion grids that match each side of the fade without looking too weird.\n* You have a lot of little extras that are transitioning, morphing, or animated differently: the most obvious examples are the ginger woman's hair that's made to \"fall\", and the beard of the man right after getting \"drawn in\".\n* I suspect they might have made some parts distort into each other at staggered speeds instead of each entire side of the fade at once.\n\nIn short... it's a simple effect on paper, but there's a LOT of hard manual work on top that pushes it to the next level, and that's what's really impressive, especially for the time.",

When my sister and I told him he was in this video and he saw it he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. When it came on we\u2019d yell for him to get his ass down here and he\u2019d usually come. This was when it was on mtv or vh1 so he couldn\u2019t really show anyone because nobody knew what the hell he\u2019d be talking about. It always cracked me and my sister up tho. We didn\u2019t even record it. Just if it was on while we were channel surfing after school. It was on pretty heavy rotation tho",

The system with Tiendas De Raya, the class system, the exploitation of the poor.\n\nIt was a different time, before the labor movements, but the man got what he deserved: a country rose up against him and kicked him out. Mexico actually created one of the first, socialized legal code in history: the labor law code. The new Mexican Constitution resulting from the revolution was actually pretty advcanced for the time, as well.",

His travels capture so much of the blur between actual history and mythology that coexist to form the tapestry of a lawless, violent, kind, desperate, welcoming place. The contradictions are stark but only add to the allure of the mountain range.",

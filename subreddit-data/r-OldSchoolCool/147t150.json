That's why I told my wife that as much importance as we put on photos, they have a bout 60 -80 years emotional shelf-life. Once all the people who have any living memory of the people photographed are dead and gone, there's no living emotional attachment. My dad tried to give me his grandfather's flag that was on his casket at his funeral. I never knew the man. He was dead before I was born. I graciously declined. It's meaningless to me. And it further surprised me at all the people who look for and collect old slides and old 8mm  as a hobby. But it is a window into the past. Imagine if this woman posing in this photo in the late 50's, was told that in 65 years, millions of strangers all over the world will be seeing this photo.",

I like to collect interesting and cool slides but sell some of them to recoup some money. I feel  some of them absolutely need to be in digital format for posterity before the original copy is gone and nobody would ever see it again.",

But some people just don't care. It take all kinds, I guess. But sad that someone put so much effort, time, and money into capturing those memories only to have them sold to a stranger. And slide was the best way to keep old photos. My dad only shot on slide film, so all of our childhood photos are incredible shape. I actually bought a Canon negative and slide scanner for doing the digitizing. Have you given any thought to posting all those slides to Flickr? That would be a neat collection to look through.",

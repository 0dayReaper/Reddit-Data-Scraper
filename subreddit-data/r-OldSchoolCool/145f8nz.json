            "comment": "My dad was billeted across the street from a very nice family in Le Mans during the war. They had four children, and my mom (back home in the States) used to send socks, soap, candy, and other items the family couldn't get, and Dad would take the things over to them. They stayed in touch even after the war.\n\nDad died in 1994, and since then I have continued his correspondence with the little girl, Nelly, who is now an older lady. I got to meet her in 2014. She cried when she told me how, at one point, she and her younger brothers were sent to a farm in the countryside, where they could have eggs and milk and fresh produce. Her parents and older brother had to stay in the city, where they went hungry. Sometimes they ate \"pain chien\" (\"dog bread\"), made of crumbs and food scraps, sometimes swept up from the floor. \n\nNelly always sends greetings for our American holidays and shared her condolences on 9/11.\n\nI have some drawings that her older brother, Roland, made for Dad during the war, of Jeeps and airplanes and other military scenes.\n\nI have another French friend whose dad was in the Maquis (the French Resistance) and later served as Dad's translator. His son and I are like brother and sister.\n\nThese relationships are very dear to me.",

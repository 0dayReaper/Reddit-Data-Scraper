Many men of color were getting promoted to jobs that were higher paying and decided to move closer to work or into better neighborhoods. The promotions often entailed moving to different towns when the headquarters were located away from the manufacturing plants. This brought the children to schools that were traditionally all white as well. Most parents encouraged their kids to make friends with the \u201cnew kid\u201d knowing diversification was the wave of the future. ",

It sounds terrible, but somehow, it wasn\u2019t.\nAt school we had bullies, and bullied kids, but was different than what you see today, even the bullied kids were part of the group, no one was ever \u201cisolated\u201d, I think that is a main difference with bulking today.\nI can\u2019t comment much on Peru now, as I am in Australia since 2006, and just go back for short periods to visit my family. Peru looks a lot better now though, we have more infrastructure and less poverty, terrorism has been replaced by burglars and extortionists, some of them coming from neighbour countries. \nThere are a lot more Venezuelans now in Peru, especially in Lima, but they are mostly good hard-working people, they are just trying to escape from their government.\nTraffic is terrible in Lima these days.\nTouristic places like Cuzco, Arequipa, etc. Are relatively safe, and hotels are great.\nAs always, the food is the best, that hasn\u2019t changed ......\nAll in all, Peru is a great place to live and visit now, if security is improved, it would be one of the best Countries in South America.",

Here boys would ask for girl\u2019s numbers, and as soon a girl would release her number, you had to be fast to hung up and call her, if you were the first one to call her, you had a chance to get a blind date. Remember it was the 80s, so this was more likely not dangerous for the boy or girl, usually a harmless blind date.\nThis all ended when the Telco started supporting tones.",

Sept came around and they started first grade.  My mom and the kid's Mom decided they would take turns walking them to &amp; from school.  The first time it was the other Mom's turn, when it came time to cross the street she took  their hands.  My brother looked down when they were across and blurted out, in awe, \"Hey! you're BROWN!\"  The other Mom cracked up and we all do when we tell the story. My Mom raised us right, too. ",

My mum reminded me, whilst I had a little cry when I found out about his death, about my first encounter with him...\n\nShe saw me and him through the window of the classroom when she was waiting to pick me up. When I came out she asked if I had a new friend, and I said \"yes\". She asked me what he looked like and I replied \"he's tall with curly hair\". She said she knew then that she's raised me right because I never mentioned his skin colour, not once. Unfortunately he got called all sorts of names at school, and I simply didn't understand it. He was literally just shy of 6ft at 10 years old and got bullied. Great lad, the world lost a good one when he went... Sorry to ramble. Just nice to remember him so fondly.",

Last place you\u2019d expect, but the evolution is far from over, and it wasn\u2019t nearly as far as it should have been even in the 80\u2019s. My earliest memory of racism is a black brother and sister walking to jr. high along our route. Some of the kids took to throwing rocks at them. My friends and I took to protecting them and throwing rocks back. The family moved out of the neighborhood after a few months, but my friends and I never understood. To this day I still can\u2019t say I understand, but I accept. Some people are just rotten to the core. I can\u2019t be happier that my friends and I were never raised to find ourselves thinking like that. But I\u2019m still amazed to this day when I think about how we were actually the minority thinkers in our calm, suburban Chicago area. ",

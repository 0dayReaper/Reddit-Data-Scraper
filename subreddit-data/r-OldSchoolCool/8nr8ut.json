Once he found success, his manager wouldn't let him change his hairstyle because it was such a key part of his brand. He always hated that.\n* Bob Ross made three copies of every painting. The first is always off\\-camera, as a reference. The second is the one you see him paint. The third, he painted after taping, while his assistant took snapshots of each step for his how\\-to books.\n* Bob Ross donated all of his on\\-air paintings to local PBS stations, to use as auctions for their fundraisers.",

PBS (then called \"NET\" for National Educational Television) was on channel 28, and our old TV didn't have a UHF tuner.  About '67, they decided to get cable, so we finally got 28. They were very excited about getting NET.  I was less enthused.\n\nBut the first thing we tuned in with our new cable equipped TV was Bob Ross. I was enthralled.  To me at age 13, watching anything else on NET was like watching paint dry, but Bob Ross was cool!",

Good, kind people making uplifting and educational content for free for everyone on YouTube, Twitch, and in the podcasting world. I try to make a habit of sharing those people whenever I can. Here are some:\n\n- Matt Mercer: Dungeon Master for Critical Role, wherein nerdy voice actors play D&amp;D and support an amazing charity. Matt is one of the sweetest, kindest human beings on Earth... Presumably because he gets out all his stress destroying the players' characters.\n- Chris Hadfiel: Astronaut. Philanthropist. Canadian. Need I say more?\n- The McElroy brothers: Podcasters and all around good humans who make exactly the kind of light-hearted (although sometimes also deeply emotional and touching) content out there. Car Boys and The Adventure Zone are personal favorites.\n- Hank and John Green: Educational and moving YouTube videos and podcasts about life, the universe, and our place in it. Honest, generous, and positive.\n- Bill Gates: Systematically donating 90% of his wealth to charity via a foundation that specifically seeks the most effective way to improve life for the world's poorest people.\n\nNow, you probably have heard of all of these people, and that's kind of my point. The world is full of amazing people who make it a better place. Sometimes we just need a bit of a reminder of that.\n\nBut hey, more couldn't hurt. Be the change. I hope you have a great day.",

She ended up being a stay at home mom for three boys and went on to work for a school board, as a legal secretary and finally as an insurance adjustor. She continued to paint in her spare time but she never considered herself an artist. \n\nShe died of lung cancer in 2013 at the age of 62.

I'm 24 and i've noticed a lot of my peers have discovered Bob Ross recently and also there are also many who have the \"I liked Bob before he was cool\" mentality. I just have to say that i'm so thrilled to see people my age embrace Bob Ross &amp; The Joy Of Painting in today's world. I learned so many life lessons from my father but also from Bob's program. Kindness, patience, and that its okay to make mistakes as they are happy little accidents. In today's world the Bob Ross \"hype\" that's hit recently really is a breath of fresh air.\nRest easy Bob, thank you for the inspiration you've given me. I hold it close to my heart. And thank you OP, for sharing this wonderful photo.",

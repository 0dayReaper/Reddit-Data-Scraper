At one point, I was doing 25mph and had a line of cars behind me following my lights. \n\nArriving in Birmingham, I parked behind a MacDonald's with the rest of the truckers and found that three of my four roof vents had been blown off in the wind. Travelled a half mile back up the road where I had seen a Lowe's that was about to close for the night. After asking the manager, she graciously allowed me to spend the  night under their loading dock out of the rain. \n\nLove the town and what it has become. Met my girlfriend a few years later just east of there and we're enjoying life together.",

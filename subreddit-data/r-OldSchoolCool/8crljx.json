Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.",

Although originally polarizing to audiences and critics alike, it developed a much deserved cult following when released on digital video disk,\nor DVD.  There, it found a second life and really came into its own commercially and artistically.  The movie works both as a grim examination of male vanity while also maintaining real genre thrills, justifying these tonal shifts by placing the audience inside the head of the duplicitous lead character.  Christian Bale's dynamite performance gives it a big boost.  The role almost went to Leo but no one could have brought that certain pathos and charisma to it quite like Bale, a role he later recalled a shade of in Christopher Nolan's Batman pictures.  In 2005, Lionsgate released the uncut version.  I think it's an undisputed masterpiece, a movie so entertaining most people probably don't listen to the message, but they really should. Because it's not just a great character study but also a sardonic metaphor for 80s greed and materialism. ",

Genesis had already put together an album of their own, but it was not ambitious like their subsequent music, and they saw a dedicated drummer as the way forward.  Phil Collins had played some secondary percussion on a George Harrison recording, so as far as Peter Gabriel and associates were concerned, they were booking musical royalty.\n\nYet Phil took things seriously too.  He scheduled himself for a 4pm slot, but he showed up early in the day.  Watching other drummers trying to find their groove with the band, he really got a grip on the material and the group vibe.  By the time he stepped up for his own tryout, it was like they were already a band.\n\nAlso, after Peter Gabriel went solo, Phil Collins participated in the lead vocalist process by preparing an audition tape and submitting it under another name.  I'm not sure if he led the discussion with remarks like, \"wow, that bloke has a great set of pipes on 'im, don't 'e?\" but the group agreed the voice on that tape should be their first audition.  When he revealed it was him all along, they were ready for their next chapter as a band.",

He had already song on several songs by the band, so they certainly would have recognized his singing voice immediately. Furthermore, when I've heard them describe the story, they just said he went into the studio and took a go at singing \"Squonk\", nothing about an audition tape.",

I remember my favorite music venue in Chicago during the 70s had so many talented acts that could be uglier than sin but no one cared. It was really just about the music back then, it was a gentler time. I remember this one night there was a young singer-songwriter who must have been the most beautiful girl I ever saw. We used to just go wild for Jane. I even got to hang out with her and some other musicians after the show. Sadly, some pig nosed singer tried to ask me out and I had to turn her down because she was just too ugly. Afterwards we would boo her anytime she went on stage just so we wouldn't have to look at her. Anyway, it's sad that this generation can't look past a musicians looks so we could have talented artists on the radio again.",

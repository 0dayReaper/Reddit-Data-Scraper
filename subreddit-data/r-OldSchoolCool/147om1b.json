MC\u2019s lows are *low*, but she has a 5 octave range and whistle register. Some people classify her as lyric soprano. If you\u2019re thinking about it in terms of being an alto or a soprano, her range is wide and developed enough that she can sing alto or soprano (not that uncommon, I\u2019ve sung in plenty of choirs with girls who sing either). If you want to simplify it, Whitney is more about power, preciseness, and richness of tone, Mariah is more about range and agility. That\u2019s not to say Whitney\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t agile or that her range was limited, or that Marian\u2019s voice isn\u2019t powerful or with its own rich tone, it\u2019s just their stand out qualities.",

She would have been in the orphanage starting about early to mid 1950s. Maybe even later. I'm not sure what age she went in. I'm not sure if my uncle was with my grandmother or not, but I never heard anything about him going to one. My mom has expressed basically how annoyed she is that she made sure everyone got to the US, and he became more financially successful ..lol. Anyway. It's also possible she was in Russia, but that may have been later (went to college level school in st petersburg)\n\n\n\nAny idea on how to narrow it down? My mom's memory is fuzzy and I don't want to bring things up that will upset her too much, it was very traumatic. She's ok with talking about it sometimes but I try not to push it.. I think my sister knows more than me but she's never given me a solid answer.",

Many children had visits from parents, grandparents, aunts &amp; uncles, etc. \n\nI do not know much about Romanian children's orphanages, but I heard they were much poorer.",

It was not dubbed in my native language, but i guess i didn't really care. Throughout my time in school i was always the one with the most understanding of English, yet i still don't remember ever opening an English text book. I am convinced that watching undubbed cartoons(games, movies and pirated copies of the Simpsons also helped) at a very young age taught me English. From what i know a kid's brain is very plastic and flexible so their learning ability is in overdrive. That's also why babies learn their native language much the same way, just by listening to their parents.",

So many people get confused in their memories of loving D\u00f2taman, which was only ever in Gaelic. It's really common for people as adults to be really confused that it was never in English, coz they don't speak Gaelic but remember understanding it.\n\nThe way little kids absorb language is absolutely fascinating.",

To this day I still have a clear memory of being in that classroom and looking around at everyone interacting. I couldn\u2019t understand why everyone else was babbling at each other and interacting, laughing, playing, and I wasn\u2019t doing the same in the same way. I thought they were all part of a special club or something. I guess no one explained that they were speaking a different language, or I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nOne of my core memories is the Halloween party at school- I was offered a rice crispy treat, first one I ever had. It was SO DELICIOUS. I REALLY wanted another one, they were just sitting there on the tray for everyone to grab. But I was raised in a Polish household and it\u2019s customary to raise your kids to always ask before your take. I didn\u2019t know how to ask for another treat, so I sat there watching the treats and watched the other kids grabbing them, thinking they were asking. I never had a second one. \n\nBut in reality it was for everyone. That must have been really stressful for me lol since I still remember it 30 years later\n\n\nAnyway I eventually learned English by watching scooby doo, and attending my next year of school",

We moved in late spring so I had the entire summer to learn English before starting kindergarten.\n\nI thought I integrated seamlessly.  It was years later that my parents told me I was speaking my native language exclusively and no one understood me.  I distinctly remember understanding everyone though.\n\nStill had a blast, eating Cap'n crunch watching cable TV, playing with cool toys like transformers, even got an Atari.",

Thought I was learning English during that time from watching tv and from the friends I made in our apartment complex.  Turns out I was learning Spanish the whole time lol.  I still remember being so confused on the first day of school.  Class had Asian, black &amp; white kids and I didn\u2019t understand anything anyone was saying.  Hella culture shock. Took the school like a few weeks to figure out that I didn\u2019t speak English and I ended up in ESL for the next few years.  Teacher thought I was a mute and called my parents in.  She realized immediately that I was a foreigner when my parents showed and they didn\u2019t speak any English either.  I remember the first day they sent me to ESL and I was so excited to see my friends from my apts in class for the first time since starting school. Hahah good times",

But everyone loved Vlad because he was so humble and chill. Good artist too. The students befriended him and helped him learn a ton of English in a very short amount of time. By time the semester was over he was damn near fully fluent.\n\nSad part is Vlad\u2019s parents yanked him out of school because he joined the football team and, in his own words here, his parents didn\u2019t want him getting the shit knocked out of him by a bunch of black kids. It bummed us out. To this day I remember him and go out of my way to talk with non-native English speakers and make them feel comfortable. Language is a big barrier to seeing people\u2019s true personality. The lack of confidence im speaking can completely change how others relate to you. At least one person doing their best to engage in regular conversation and build up that confidence can work wonders.",

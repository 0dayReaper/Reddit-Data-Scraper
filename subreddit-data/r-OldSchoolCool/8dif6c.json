They apparently did this while I was in surgery, so that way when I woke up I'd be able to play.\n\nI woke up and they showed me the Gameboy and it for sure took the mind off the pain, they had Tetris and ninja turtles.\n\nI was excited all things considered, so they open it up put the batteries in and put in the Tetris cartridge and I can still hear the music.\n\nOne small problem, I had an IV in my right hand and my hand tapped down to a board to keep the IV in place and my hand not to move.\n\nSo I had to watch my parents play my Gameboy for hours trying to beat each other's score on Tetris.",

They literally convinced people that VCRs could not be engineered to safely rewind tapes without dying, and that the only reasonably thing to do was drop an additional $40 on a machine that did just that.\n\nEdit: I sit corrected. The people have spoken and the VCR rewinder was not a scam. However, I can attest to watching my copy of Police Academy I about 500 times using the VCR to rewind without incident. Maybe I just got lucky. MAHONEY!\n\n",

He was about to beat either Mario or Mario 3 (not sure which, just def not 2, and I thought it was like 2am, but my mom said it was about 11pm). Took about another hour after they got me up, but he did it! It was awesome. \n\n",

A lot of the time was them sitting in a bubble watching me go. Mario cart was the best though.

We lived 600 km away and in a different country so I would only see him like  once a year on average. It was was great to see him because that meant I would get to see the SNES to, which was a lot of fun for a 7 year old. So once a year I would have at the maximum a couple of days to try to beat Super Mario Brothers 2, you know the one where you can play with Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess.  All my other nephews and nieces where a lot better then me a the game, but they lived in the same neighbourhood so they got to play it all the time. \n\nSo you can imagine how frustrating it was for 9 year old me (that's right 2 years have passed now and I still have not gotten pass like level 3 or something) when diner was ready and my mom came and turned to console of, making me lose al my progress. Having 1 or 2 or 3 days to increase my progress from lasts year was hard enough, people randomly turning the console of did not make that any easier. \n\nEventually I discovered I could just like disconnect the cable to the TV and keep the console on pause and hope nobody would reset the thing. \n\nI think I was like 11 or 12 when I first discovered the first warp. When you discover something like this all by yourself it's quite something. Of course my nephews and nieces where not impressed. (who told the weird kid about the warp?) \n\nWhen I was about 13 or 13, I first made it to the final level. Now don't think I am the most horrible gamer in the world, I was only the most patient. My parents use to be orthodox christians (now they are regular christians) so back in 2000 when I was 15 we had a small black and white TV with antenna to watch Little House on the Prairie in 50 shades of noise and no computer. But luckily in 2001 we finally got a computer! It was amazing or so I thought, a Apple Macintosh from 1985 with no hard drive that booted from a floppy disk, and without a second floppy with software. The machine was completely useless for 16 year old me, the only fun thing I ever did with it was change the background pixels in to little swastikas and also flip the switch at the back from 220V to 110V. Which created this amazing visual effect of smoke coming out of the machine since Europe has 220V on its power sockets. That day  I was able to teach my dad that computer chips run on smoke. Look dad, when the smoke it out of the chip it does not work anymore. \n\nThis forced my dad to buy a new computer. Anyway the point in telling all of this, is that it was not until about the year 2002 that I was old enough to make my own money and buy my own computer.  So when it came to playing computer games the first like 17 years of my life it all depended on sleepovers with classmates that has parents with computers with games on it. It was no surprise that I was friends with all the best  class mates with the best parents with the best computers with the most fun games. (wolf3d, raptor, jetpack, prince of persia) \n\n\nBack to Super Mario Brothers 2. Since I only got to play that game maybe 10 hours every year it took a while to get good at it. \n\nSo it took me about 10 years before I first completed the entire game. \nNot to long after that my grandfather died and the family decided that the weird kid would get the SNES, since all my nephews and nieces had long grown bored of the game and my grandfather only bough two games with it. The other game I never really played, it was a game about flying through the universe with spaceship shaped like an egg and that game was way to hard for 7 year old me. And since it took me 10 years to complete game 1. Anway to make a long story a litte bit shorter. After the SNES was mine and I had it on my room where I could play it at any time I made it a challenge to become better at the game then anybody in our family.\n\nIf you put me in front of that SNES with a blindfold on, I think I can still finish the first two levels just on muscle memory. After I got old enough to have my own money for my own computer and gaming system I went on like a never ending gaming rumspringa break and made up for all those years where everybody my age was gaming all the time, except poor me. \n\nNow if only my nieces and nephews would come over and I could show them how I can finish Super Mario Brothers 2 in under 20 minutes without loosing a single life ....   but I don't think they care that much anymore about me not wasting a life ... \n\nThe last thing I will ever do in my life before dying (if I am granted to die old in bed) is to pop in the cartridge and finish Super Mario Brother 2 without dying once ... then I can die in peace and hopefully princess will be on the other side.

My mom hooked it up to the TV. I played for an hour or so. Then my mom said we should go outside to see the snow. I was all like...what the fuck is snow? I'm about to save a princess for fuck's sake! Snow can't be that cool...what ever that is. \n\n\nWe lived in a house near the beach and I remember walking outside and instantly being over nipple deep in this winter wonderland and having a complete mind fuck.\n\n\nI was just busting shells and squashing mushrooms, having the time of my life and now I'm in this crazy stuff called snow...having another time of my life.\n\nI have never since been so torn between outside and video games.

My parents somehow managed to scrape together enough to build a modest home when I was 12.  We moved in and it was like heaven to me.  (Had my own room for the first time in my life!)\n\nI was a Boy Scout and as such, I subscribed to a monthly scouting magazine titled \u201cBoy\u2019s Life.\u201d  Along with the articles on camping and hiking, Boy\u2019s Life always had an article on current technology.  \n\nThe first summer that we moved into our new house, the magazine featured an article on the latest high tech game console: Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\nAs a disciple of the occasional arcade game, I was absolutely awestruck by the description of the NES.  One of my most vivid childhood memories is of taking that magazine article to my mother and asking a question that I already knew the answer to.\n\nWell, much to my shock and surprise, she glanced at the article and said, \u201cGo ask your dad.\u201d  This was not the default answer of \u201cno\u201d that I was so used to hearing.  I was shocked. I ran to my dad and asked him.  He said that he was good with it if mom was.  I thought that I was dreaming.  Things like this never happened around my home.\n\nThe very next day we went to Target and purchased an NES.  Hooked it up to the one television in our home (Magnavox floor console with dial - no remote.). Played Super Mario Brothers for what was probably 12 straight hours.\n\nMy dad got mad about not being able to watch tv and bought me a 13\u201d (color!) television on the next day. Mom placed the tv and the NES in the very small, very dark closet connected to our dining area.  \n\nI spent most of my summer in the dark playing Super Mario Bros and a couple of other favs like Excite Bike.\n\nSadly, about 6 months later, my folks divorced.  I moved with my mom and my younger bro to a very small house.  Got Metroid.  Got sick.  Could hardly move.  Played NES on the couch for several days until mom dragged me to the doctor.\n\nDouble pneumonia.  In hospital for two weeks.  Almost died.  Begged mom for my NES.  No way.  I daydreamed about Metroid for  two weeks while in hospital.  Got out and (finally) beat the game.\n\nNES was probably the best gift that I have ever received.  It literally saved my life.",

I never thought in a million years that I would ever get a Nintendo 64 for Christmas but somehow a miracle (grandparents) happened and upon opening the present from my mom I went completely bananas to find a Nintendo 64 box. I also noticed that it had been opened and used. I come to find out that she had been playing with it over the past month. No big deal. Its when she told us that we had to leave it at her place, that was a crushing blow. I had access to it two days a month. A year later when she got tired of playing it, she let us take it home to our Dad's house.",

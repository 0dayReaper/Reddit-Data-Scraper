Old man grabbed him by the ankles, pulled his feet out from under him, and lifted him off the ground. My dad didn't smart off to him anymore. lol",

He had lifted weights for York Barbell and toured around the world with the company when they did demonstrations and competitions. I saw some of his pictures with boxers and other competitive lifters. During WW2, a lot of milkmen stayed back home because their services were considered to be essential and they weren't sent off to war. During a delivery in York, he smelled gas in an apartment building and got everyone evacuated before there were any serious injuries. This was taken my a newspaper photographer for a national circulation, kind of like an AP photo.",

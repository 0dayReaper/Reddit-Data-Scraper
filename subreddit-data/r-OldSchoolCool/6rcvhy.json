My dad's brother lived with him at the time and had a PS2 as well, so I just took my memory card and a couple of games with me. Came back home from summer to  be met with heartbreak. We didn't have a lot of spare money so I never got a new one. My mom felt really bad, so I just told her it was okay that I was too old for video games anyway. She cooked whatever I wanted for dinner for like 2 months though... ate my feelings for those next 2 months too.\n\nI know this wasn't heartwarming like y'alls stories but it's the only story I got.

But there was a time when I could do a flawless run. At a certain point, it's more memory than skill: you need to know when certain enemy spawns happen so that you don't have to react. Back in college, one of my roommates and I would play every night. We eventually got to the point where we could beat the game with maybe one or two deaths between the two of us. Two player is harder too, because the screen scrolls with the player in the back, not the front, so you need to make sure the player in front doesn't get screwed by enemy spawns right on top of him. Now, the Contra sequels are fucking hard. I don't know how people do those.",

It became clear though that one of the games, Advance Wars, was not bought for me as every day when I would get off from school and he would be waiting in his car to pick me up, he'd be sitting with the GBA playing Advance Wars. He didn't play it for too long, I don't think he even beat it, but I think the screen may have been the issue because when the SP came out he bought one of those for himself and played quite a few games on that.",

The year was 1995 and the game I had unwrapped for my birthday was Warcraft II. I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to give a three-year-old a fantasy battle simulator - probably one of my much older brothers. Of course, I was ecstatic over the present and, upon tearing the packaging open, I ran to the family computer room to install my new game.\n\nPost-installation, I ran into trouble; my reading ability, deductive reasoning, and fine motor skills were somewhat limited at my young age and that created a hard to surmount set of barriers that stood in the way of me learning the game.\n\nI remember crying out of frustration and my mom rushing in a panic to help me in whatever way possible. We were able to thumb through the booklet that came with the game and, between the two of us, we discerned how to move the units and construct the buildings.\n\nMy life wasn't easy as a kid. I went through a lot of abuse. But... I dunno. The scene in the post just poked my brain and it unexpectedly vomited out a memory I hadn't visited in a while.",

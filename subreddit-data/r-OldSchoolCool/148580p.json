Hug your parents whenever you can.\n\nEDIT:  My mother was asked before the arranged marriage because there were other suitors. Yes in that era the bride was suppose to look sad not because she hated the man she was about to marry.  Your suppose to look sad for leaving your fathers home, your siblings, the village you grew up in and are about to head to the South Bronx right before the crack epidemic hits.\n\nEDIT2: Thank you all for your beautiful comments and for people with true interest im going to give some background info. there was no dowry, my mother wasn\u2019t \u201csold\u201d,  only a exchange of gifts and jewelry between the two families. My mother was a school teacher and my father was a sailor on the Greek merchants ships in the 1970\u2019s.  Like many arranged marriages there was a matchmaker involved that connected their two families.  After marriage he went back to working on the ships then went to NYC where soon after my mother came.  They both worked hard in the service industry, saved their money and bought a restaurant that I run today.\n\nFor the time period snd culture they were born into my parents were just following the norms.  They never forced me or my siblings to get arranged marriages or marry within our ethnicity.",

Once a prospective match is made, they have a preliminary joint family meet-up, and the couple's views are sought. If it's a green light from both, further semi-chaperoned/unchaperoned dates are arranged. Traditional (only Hindu, I think) families also run a horoscope match and an auspicious date for the wedding is picked.\n\nDefinitely not something I would prefer, but a far cry from back in the day when the groom had little choice &amp; the bride none whatsoever.",

Girl smiling in their wedding pics could lead to gossiping aunties claiming the girl was of \"loose character\". It could be taken to mean that the girl wasn't going to miss her parents (brides crying in weddings is a big ceremony to this day). Or maybe the girl was just irritated - who knows.\n\nLong story short, there could be a thousand reasons for her not smiling and not all of them are that she is unhappy/there against her will. Girls smiling beatifically in wedding photos was squarely a western thing and has only recently percolated to India. Before that most girls (and more often than not guys too) went for the austere/dignified look.",

They are set up by your parents and in most cases you do have a choice in whether or not you accept. It's clear from the comments in this post that most people think all arranged marriages are forced on the woman and she has absolutely no say in the matter. Although this does happen, it's not the norm. At best you could say there might be a lot of familial pressure on the bride and groom if the \"deal\" is good.",

He recounted the Evers story as he was called in to oversee it, and there were lots of photos from what I remember. Maybe your dad made the cut!\n\n I distinctly remember his telling how Evers' son, who was only a small child when his dad was murdered, was present for the exhumation and the same age his dad was when he died. Baden had been against his son being present for it because usually bodies are so horribly deteriorated after multiple decades underground, even when embalmed. When they opened the casket, the room gasped because he looked like he had just died yesterday. Dr Baden had never seen anything like it, and was moved that his son got to see his father in such pristine condition.",

Lieutenant in the Marines and did his first deployment in Vietnam in 1967 and did his final tour coming home in1972 because I remember my mom was excited he was going to make her high school graduation. He had nightmares ranging from waking up screaming up to pointing a gun at my great aunt when she came back to the bedroom in the middle of the night. Nicest man you'd ever want to meet and it was impossible to think he'd ever killed someone, but he did and he struggled with it for the rest of his life.\n\n\nThen you have the people who don't see the person they are killing as a human being. They see them as basically vermin or lower than animals. Which is why when you start hearing someone referring to a group of people as pests, vermin, etc it's time to pay attention because they are trying to dehumanize them. Mix this with the fear that their very quality of life or safety is threatened and then it comes \"Them or me\".",

This implies (maybe I just inferred?) that anyone from there who disagrees with this type of action should leave. Give the cradle of the civil rights movement, a second look because the people there who loathe this behavior are more than you\u2019d think. And the fight never would have happened otherwise. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t think a semantic argument on the matter is helpful, and my post is already longer than I intended, as someone with family in Mississippi, deep roots in Georgia, and who has lived in Alabama, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there are many people who abhor racism and all forms of injustice, actively fight it, and are also deeply planted in their communities in Mississippi, and other states you may find to be white trash states. \n\nUnfortunately, we/they are so often outnumbered and outmaneuvered by systemic racism and those who\u2019d you\u2019d correctly identify as white trash. These states have their problems TO BE SURE. Alas, home is home and there are those of us who want to make these places better as opposed to leaving for someplace else. \n\nBut, as much as I want you and anyone else who feels compelled, to keep posting this type of history, I want you to also understand how many of us affirm your point of view right up until the time you call us white trash because of where we live. All that does is create another line of division and weakens the ability to improve communities as it creates a feeling that we have no have no compatriots outside the south. \n\nBe better my friend. We will too.",

Time isn't free and one's patience for naysayers is not limitless.\n\nIf you or anyone passing through is sincere in their interest in a genuine intro to the Black American experience, I'd recommend I Am Not Your Negro.

This claim is obviously insane for anyone with knowledge of history or politics, but to summarize:\n\n- The labels \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" bare extremely little relevancy to the original Ku Klux Klan, as American politics did not stop developing 200ish years ago when the original Klan was founded. Back then, northern Republicans broadly opposed slavery while southern Democrats supported it.\n\n- The modern Ku Klux Klan supports policies which broadly align with the most radically far right Republicans of the modern US political landscape. While the vast, overwhelming majority of US politicians shun the KKK, there is no denying that a contingent of the US Right-Wing has been more in favor of cooperating and collaborating with them.\n\n- Therefore a modern Klansman is much, much more likely to support Republicans than Democrats\n\nAs for the \"Democrats are untouchable\"\n\n- This is an extention of the Right-Wing narrative that prominent Democrats are all a part of some secret cabal who control the world. Some call them the Lizard People, some call them the Illuminati, but they all mean the same thing: Jews. The \"Deep State\" narrative QAnon (the fraction of the US far right who believe Donald Trump is the second coming of Christ Jesus) likes to push is just a very blatant and unsubtle reference to the Jewish Question, an explicitly Nazi conspiracy theory about Jews controlling modern society. It's a dogwhistle, in the sense that it is meant as a covert signal to other who share this belief.\n\nQuixk Edit: if you want to get a better understanding of this probably look beyond Reddit",

Here are some cases where the police have been accused of framing black individuals:\n\nThe Rampart Scandal (1990s): The Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division was involved in widespread corruption, including framing black individuals, planting evidence, and false testimonies. Officer Rafael Perez confessed to these misconducts, leading to the overturning of numerous convictions.\n\nDarrell Lomax (1996): Darrell Lomax, a black man, was wrongfully convicted of murder in Connecticut based on fabricated evidence and witness coercion by police officers. He spent more than 15 years in prison before being exonerated in 2013.\n\nMark Denny and Gary Smith (2003): Mark Denny and Gary Smith, both black men, were wrongfully convicted of a rape and robbery in Boston. It was later revealed that the police had manipulated witnesses and concealed evidence. They were exonerated in 2004.\n\nAnthony Wright (1993): Anthony Wright, a black man, was convicted of rape and murder in Pennsylvania based on a coerced confession. DNA evidence later proved his innocence, and he was exonerated in 2016. It was discovered that the police had framed him.\n\nJonny Gammage (1995): Jonny Gammage, a cousin of NFL player Ray Seals, died during a traffic stop in Pennsylvania. He was unarmed but died in police custody due to excessive force. The officers involved were acquitted, leading to accusations of a cover-up and framing of Gammage.\n\nThese cases illustrate instances where black individuals have been targeted and falsely accused by the police, leading to wrongful convictions and grave injustices. It is important to recognize that these are just a few examples, and there may be additional cases that have not received widespread attention or been thoroughly investigated",

Not surprising, people use trickery to make points all the time.\n\nYes, black people are more likely to be framed by the police compared to white people. Extensive research, data, and studies consistently demonstrate significant racial disparities within the criminal justice system. These disparities manifest in various forms, including higher rates of police stops, arrests, and convictions for black individuals.\n\nSystemic biases, racial profiling, and unequal treatment contribute to the increased likelihood of black individuals being framed or wrongfully accused. These biases stem from historical and ongoing racial discrimination, socioeconomic inequalities, and other systemic factors.\n\nHere is a list of black people who have wrongly been convicted for a serious crime for your viewing pleasure:\n\nRyan Ferguson: Convicted in 2005, Ferguson was wrongfully found guilty of the 2001 murder of a newspaper editor in Missouri. He was exonerated in 2013 after new evidence emerged.\n\nAmanda Knox: In 2007, Knox, an American student, was wrongfully convicted of the murder of her roommate in Italy. She was acquitted in 2015 due to lack of evidence and flaws in the investigation.\n\nAnthony Graves: Graves was wrongly convicted in 1994 for the 1992 murder of six family members in Texas. He was exonerated in 2010 after spending over 18 years in prison, with no evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nDarlie Routier: In 1997, Routier was wrongfully convicted of murdering her two young sons in Texas. Questions surrounding evidence and an unfair trial led to ongoing appeals, and she remains on death row.\n\nRay Krone: Krone was wrongly convicted twice for the 1991 murder of a Phoenix waitress in Arizona. He was exonerated in 2002 after DNA evidence pointed to another suspect.\n\nKirk Bloodsworth: Convicted in 1985 for the rape and murder of a young girl in Maryland, Bloodsworth became the first American on death row to be exonerated by DNA evidence in 1993.\n\nTimothy Cole: Cole was wrongfully convicted in 1986 for the rape of a Texas Tech University student. He died in prison in 1999 but was posthumously exonerated in 2009 through DNA testing.\n\nSabrina Butler: In 1990, Butler was wrongfully convicted of killing her infant son in Mississippi. She was exonerated in 1995 after evidence emerged of her son's pre-existing medical condition.\n\nBrian Banks: In 2002, Banks was wrongly convicted of rape in California. He was exonerated in 2012 after his accuser recanted her testimony.\n\nDamien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley Jr. (West Memphis Three): Convicted in 1994 for the murder of three young boys in Arkansas, these individuals were released in 2011 after new DNA evidence and other factors cast doubt on their guilt.\n\nJohn Thompson: Thompson was wrongly convicted in 1985 for a murder in Louisiana. He was exonerated in 2003, just weeks before his scheduled execution, when evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged.\n\nGloria Killian: Convicted in 1986 for the murder of a California businessman, Killian was exonerated in 2002 after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct and perjury came to light.\n\nDarryl Hunt: Hunt was wrongly convicted in 1984 for the rape and murder of a North Carolina newspaper copy editor.

He was exonerated in 2019 when DNA evidence led to the identification of the true perpetrator.\n\nRonald Cotton: In 1984, Cotton was wrongly convicted of rape in North Carolina. He was exonerated in 1995 after DNA evidence conclusively proved his innocence.\n\nJuan Rivera: Convicted in 1993 for the rape and murder of an Illinois girl, Rivera was exonerated in 2011 after DNA evidence excluded him as the perpetrator.\n\nMarty Tankleff: Tankleff was wrongfully convicted in 1990 for the murder of his parents in New York. He was exonerated in 2007 when new evidence pointed to an alternative suspect.\n\nThomas Kennedy: Kennedy was wrongly convicted in 2001 for the murder of a Massachusetts teenager. He was exonerated in 2015 after new DNA evidence identified the true perpetrator.\n\n\nGary Gauger: Convicted in 1993 for the murder of his parents in Illinois, Gauger was exonerated in 1996 after evidence of police misconduct and a coerced confession emerged.\n\n\nRichard Alexander: Alexander was wrongly convicted in 1982 for a murder in Texas.

I suspect modern medicine could have arrested his growth and saved his life, but I wonder whether it could have preserved his health at a height of 8 or 9 feet. He envisioned himself working in advertising, but seemed to want to maintain a sense of dignity. I'm not sure whether acting in monster movies, or even biblical epics, would have appealed to him.",

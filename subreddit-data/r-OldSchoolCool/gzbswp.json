My teeth are totally fucked and I never got braces when I was younger because we were poor, and we always thought the insurance (I had Medicaid) wouldn't cover it because it wasn't looked at as a necesity but a luxury. Now that I'm 19, that's definitely the case.\n\nJust before my 19th birthday, I decided fuck it. I have the money, I'll just pay the $6,000 for braces myself. I go in to get my consultation, and the orthodontist basically says that my teeth AND my jaw are totally screwed. \n\nSo on top of getting braces ($6,000) for two years, I also need to have jaw surgery to break my lower jaw and pull it forward because apparently it had stunted growth when I was younger. According to Google, jaw surgery is about $15,000-$25,000. Wow, so if I want to be able to smile, I need to pay $21,000 - $31,000!?!?! Damn that's a lot! \n\nOH WAIT! There's more! I also need to get my wisdom teeth removed before I can think about doing any of that. Who would have guessed, insurance won't cover wisdom teeth extraction either. So according to Google, that's going to cost me $1000-$2400. \n\nSo let's reevaluate. Best case scenario is I only need $22,000 to be able to smile. Worst case scenario is I need $33,400 to be able to smile. \n\nAmerica's healthcare system is totally fucked. Anyways, rant over! Sorry lol",

My dad worked with a guy who had done this and worn dentures since his early 20s. They had to have them *all* pulled, because the army standard at the time was ridiculously low. As in like, 4 teeth or something.",

By the time most people showed up at the dentist, that tooth had hurt for awhile. It was probably in too bad shape to save, especially since they didn't have a lot of tools, techniques and materials then. Source: I used to pretend I was a dentist. But seriously, my mom graduated H.S. in 1945 in Queens, NY. She still has all her teeth, but the first time she went to a dentist was when she was 20. It was expensive, and people didn't realize the necessity of good oral hygiene.",

In the later 1960s her mother decided it was better to have a whole bunch of my mum's teeth removed. Mum was under 18. As soon as mum could she got dentures. My mum was neat fanatical about mine and my older sister's teeth. I nearly had to get a tooth removed earlier on this year, at 37. I cried partially because I knew how disappointed my mum would be.",

I was planning an implant for a guy for guided surgery and i felt bad because i could tell he got super taken advantage of. dude had around 17 implants. probably like 60-80k+ worth of work, broken jaw etc. We couldn't go through with the implant because there wasn't enough minimum distance between implants for us to comfortably plan it. But just based on the other implants I think this dude might be fucked in the long run. Bone will die and resorb if theres not enough space.",

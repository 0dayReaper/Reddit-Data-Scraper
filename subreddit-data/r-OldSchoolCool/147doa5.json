I always kinda like it when the opening band upstages the headliner though, especially when both bands are good.  \n\nWeird example but one time as a kid I went to see a Led Zeppelin tribute band (it was silly but they were really good), and a Pink Floyd tribute band opened for them haha\n\nThe Zeppelin band was great, and all the members even kinda looked the part, but the Floyd band was fucking awesome haha.  They didn't dress up or use \"correct\" instruments (though Floyd didn't really have a \"look\" like Zeppelin did), but they nailed the songs and it seemed way more special than the Zeppelin guys\n\nThey ended their set with Sheep and it was fantastic, they got a standing ovation and people were chanting \"encore\" haha\n\nWhen the Zeppelin guys came out in character and dressed in their period-accurate costumes and guitars, a few people booed and yelled for the Floyd guys lol\n\nThey were still really good, and won everyone over, but the Pink Floyd band was the highlight for sure.  \n\nI wish I could remember what they were called, but this was like 20 years ago lol",

I rarely see it mentioned. You're right about the Live at Budokan version of the song.\n\nLeslie West BDh'E played on a bunch of Clutch songs / albums as well. He also was in the NY studio sessions for \"Who's Next\" and \"Odds and Sods\", but The Who re-recorded the album in England (the NY versions with The Mountain are on The Who's re-releases, though).",

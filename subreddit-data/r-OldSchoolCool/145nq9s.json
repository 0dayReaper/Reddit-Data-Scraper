(Wrap your head around that).\n\nI\u2019m not trying to take away from her talent in the film. Just pointing out it was a true case of \u2018Art imitating Life\u2019.\n\nEdit. Spelling.",

Eddie married Taylor literally hours after his divorce from Reynolds was finalized. The fact that Reynolds frequently joked about it in her later life was a tribute to her resilience.\n\nEven in his own autobiography, Eddie admits that he was a lazy scumbag who coasted on his good looks and a natural, uncultivated singing talent.",

High enough that he was good friends with famous people like Neruda. The coolest thing I know about that is he was close enough that he has a book of his non-published poems that are probably worth shittons. Regardless, my mom remembers helicopters everywhere and having to hide under her bed. Her stepfather had to flee without the family but they followed the next day and lived in Argentina where they then had to flee again.\n\nDont know that much about the Pinochet regime other than those basic details and that I had two Uncles who were imprisoned in their soccer stadium. They were released eventually so I guess they were lucky. I dont think they would have released my grandfather. To this day my Grandma tells me that Neruda was murdered. Officially they said he wasnt, but coincidentally they unearthed evidence about him really being murdered just a few years ago.\n\nCurious about your experience. My moms family is all now back in Chile. Not sure how long they were in exile but theyre all back now.",

I'm sorry for your family that had to flee the country. Chile doesn't seem to fully recover from Pinochet to this day and I don't know why it doesn't get talked about much. I hope your family is okay now and holding up well after what happened last year and the pandemic.",

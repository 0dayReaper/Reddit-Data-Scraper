            "comment": "Unfortunately, Sarah Rector lost the majority of her wealth during the Great Depression\u00a0and moved out of her large house on 12th Street in Kansas City, MO (aka \"Rector Mansion\").\n\nSarah eventually sold her land in Oklahoma for a meager sum. In the 40\u2019s Sarah was awarded a settlement of an undisclosed amount on the grounds of misuse and fraud of tribal lands by the government. She later bought a small farm a very short distance south of Kansas City.\n\nSarah continued to live in the Kansas City area until her death in 1967, of a stroke, at the age of 65.",

Their chief at the time really did them a solid when the allotments came around and got it in writing from DC about selling the land and what was beneath it (i.e. the oil). IIRC the land could be sold but the rights to the oil could only be passed down through their families, and the people there would regularly receive dividends from the oil sales which resulted in them being the richest people per capita in the world at the time.",

So they started putting the temple guards in specific rooms that the kids had to go through, making it nearly impossible for them to win because they didn't have enough golden pendants (I think that's what they were called) to get away. \n\nIn the end, they ended up giving away like 38 grand prizes.  More than the amount they originally budgeted for, but not as many as they would have had they not rigged the games in later episodes.",

Anything that's closer becomes distorted to appear larger and anything further becomes distorted to appear smaller.  This is why you never use a wide-angle setting for portraits, as it distorts a person's face to unflattering proportions.\n\nOP's dad is further from the pyramid than OP is, but the relative visual sizes between them and the pyramid is nearly the same, which was achieved by the wide-angle lens making the pyramid appear smaller in OP's pic, as well as the beer can.  Also note how much the doorway at top is obscured in both pics -- you can see that the OP is closer from this bit of info as well.\n\nEDIT:  Wow, my first Reddit precious metal -- thanks! :D",

I was scared to death but proud I made it to top. \n\nThen of course when I looked out from the top I realized there were a few locals exercising on the steps. A couple of guys were walking up and chatting, while another was jogging up them like someone running up stadium steps. \n\nI climbed down sitting on my butt and inching my way down each step. All while counting down the number of steps (~110). I didnt feel comfortable until I was around step 10. And I dont even consider myself a person who is afraid of heights. \n\nI didn't feel so special after that. \n\nTldr; I was there a year before they closed the steps. By the time I climbed them, the steps were half the width most steps today are, and the constant foot traffic made them extremely smooth and slippery. It was scary. ",

So many favorite memories in that journey, I pulled over in rural New Mexico and watched white lightning in the sky at sunset while lying in the back my truck. My hair was standing up from the electricity in the air, its something I never experienced being an Alaskan boy. Camping in Zion Park was amazing. I stayed in Spokane Washington for a bit and met some great people there, camping in Colorado was amazing as well. It was a great experience meeting other people and just getting my head clear. I made it a point to not get to attached to any one place or person and focused on just enjoying being alone. It changed my life",

The very fact that it is a struggle that you survive - and defeat \u2026 not by beating it necessarily, but by existing through it \u2026 that at the end, becomes so exhilarating. Because there will be an end (most likely), and you will move on to a different form (a relationship). But it is knowing that you did live alone - and survived and came out the other side - that gives you the strength and independence to know that you could do it again if circumstances turn you to that decision. Not necessarily because you prefer it, but because you have already survived it, and thus it\u2019s always a viable option.\n\nOn top of that, it taught me how to be alone and enjoy solitude, something I cherish to this day.",

I was surrounded by toxic people, spending my time partying when I wasn\u2019t working. Lots of superficial people that were predators now that I look back on it all. I spent most of my time on the road alone, I didn\u2019t really hook up with many girls on the road, contrary to what people say here ( i find it funny though). I read a lot and started reading eastern philosophy material and books like the road less traveled. I started to listen more to nature and others. When I came back to Alaska I enrolled in college and studied philosophy and English. I met up with a girl I had known prior to leaving on this trip who was a body builder and was into the gym crowd I was in before. She had given me her number before I left and I kept it with me for whatever reason, when I came back to Alaska I found out where she was working and walked in with flowers and asked her for a date. She didn\u2019t know I was back in town and I was lucky that she accepted, 2 years later we eloped to Hawaii and got married, we still are happily married to this day with two wonderful sons who are grown up now. One just finished his nursing degree last week and the other is an artist and free spirited soul. None of this would of been possible without that journey, I never would of grown up to be selfless enough to be a good husband or father if I had continued my life prior to the trip. I\u2019m 55 now and still go to the gym and eat healthy, my wife and sons do the same. I just worked out with my oldest son Friday at the gym, he\u2019s 27. My wife and I own a business together and are fortunate enough to spend so much time together both working and playing. We\u2019ve traveled the world together from Ireland, Thailand and the Yucat\u00e1n and all points between. Ive always loved traveling and can never give it up. I always tell younger people to travel as much as they can and that it is the best education life can offer.",

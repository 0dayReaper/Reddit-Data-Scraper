She was there when they were putting on the makeup and the costume. She had *some* idea of what was going to happen and either her or her people could have stopped it if they wanted to.\n\nIt's not really *that* bad for the time. A little over-produced maybe, but that was a huge song.",

It sucks.  They tell you \"trust us, we're the professionals\" and when you disagree they remind you they can take it all away in a snap of their fingers.  It's a double edge sword and it sucks.  Milli Vanilli didn't know they weren't going to be singing until after they signed the contracts.  (dumb move to not read the contracts but)  Even when you have a lawyer go over it all there's still things you have no control over.  So many young, inexperienced, naive artists hoping to make it either have success with a stupid video or song they hate or they argue and get dropped from the label and disappear.   There's obviously some good stories from artists that stood their ground but it's rare in the plastic fucked up entertainment industry.",

It\u2019s the same fate that befell Saturday Night Fever in its terrible sequel of the same period.  Jazz style dancing was everywhere because music videos were the best new place that professional dancers could get a gig.  Even the breakout film for breakdancing \u2014 Breakin\u2019 \u2014 was basically about the merging of breakdancing with jazz dance to legitimize it for the stage.\n\nAnd last, there\u2019s the evolution of Patty Smyth as an artist.  She\u2019s a Brooklyn girl who had a hit a couple of years earlier with the band Scandal called \u201cGoodbye to You.\u201d  They were sort of a post punk pop/rock band and Smyth is one of the half dozen or so women who sang so powerfully that they\u2019re now iconic of the era, along with Pat Benatar, Ann Wilson, Joan Jett, Orinda Ross (Quarterflash) and a few others.\n\nScandal broke up after this hit and Smyth kept releasing music later on after turning down Eddie Van Halen\u2019s offer, but musical style had moved on and the 80s female rocker became pass\u00e9.",

It has its own thing going on and even has a nice organ solo.  Whoever mixed and arranged that song did a great job.  The driving bass really carries the song.  They didn't try and drown out the stellar vocals with effects and obnoxious pre-chorus.",

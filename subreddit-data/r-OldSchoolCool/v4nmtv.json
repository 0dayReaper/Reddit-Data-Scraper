I may have goofed on the time it was taken (early 50\u2019s perhaps), and I am still trying to figure out more about where in the world they were vacationing! This captured a wonderful moment of my grandpa shortly before he contracted polio. They are all from the United States. \n\nI will certainly edit as I learn more!\n\nEdit: My great uncle, who would be his brother-in-law, worked for an oil company. That\u2019s probably how they had access to such a nice camera, or knew someone with a nice camera!\n\nA helpful redditor down the chain suggested that this vehicle was a 1949-1955 Mercedes Benz O 3500, which was manufactured in Germany. My mother thinks they were most likely in Belgium or Bavaria, someplace that started with a \u201cB\u201d. \n\nEdit edit: should\u2019ve named this something else but I liked the alliteration in the title \ud83e\udd72",

Like that old \nwoman I got stuck behind in the grocery store, walking super slow with a cane in her cart, totally was like these ladies right here at some point. Chilling with a dude and her best friend, getting some sun (did they know about the sun and skin cancer back then?), might make out with him a little who knows - now slowly shuffling through a grocery store. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for me to link it. And the fact that I\u2019m going to be fucking old like that is mind blowing. AND don\u2019t get me started about the pit of anxiety I fall into when i think about the fact that I\u2019m one day, definitely, without doubt, absolutely going to die. Like I will die. It\u2019s crazy.",

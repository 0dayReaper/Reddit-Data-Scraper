It\u2019s only particularly interesting and discussion worthy now because of the progress behind our current lens.  \n\nMany people in the 1950s and 60s were married by 20 so the age to date and romance around had to be before that. \n\n16 was considered the age to wait for, (rather like how 18 is that magical line in the sand today.) Songs like this and \u201c16 Candles\u201d kind of shit reinforced it. \n\nBut people thought that they were being moral and respectful and *honorable* to wait until she\u2019s 16. The unspoken part was a 14 or 15-year-old is so beautiful and fresh and sexy\u2026 Can\u2019t wait till she\u2019s 16! - we get that implies all of that. Both that under 16 is sexy which makes us cringe now, but just as important it implies that 16 somehow makes it morally okay. It is \u201cplaying by the rules.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note this was not seeking or promoting to break a taboo but rather upholding it and honoring what was considered proper and upright. I guess it\u2019s much easier for men to behave themselves and feel good about themselves when society simply lowers the bar. \n\nAnd the truth of it is while she\u2019s singing about being 16 the reality of it is the cherry popping event she is singing about probably more commonly happened at 12 or 13 within the culture she\u2019s channeling. That she is promoting 16 is actually helping to raise their bar. /s\n\nIn fact, society lowering the bar while  people are working hard to raise it is  a lot of the culture wars are about. Men will be men - it\u2019s just \u201cboy talk\u201d to quote Melania\u2018s response when her husband boasts about stating his right to grab woman\u2019s genitalia. Every single person should be *horrified* by that statement and the low bar of accepted human interaction it promotes and establishes. \n\nFortunately, culture can change, but it\u2019s not quite fair to judge through our current lens when people were being told, as we see here, that 16 was fine and morally okay.  Reinforced through songs like this, and this is  part of what needed to change. This was going on as  late as My Sharona and Don\u2019t Stand So Close  to Me in the 80s. maybe even later I just can\u2019t think of any right now.  Prince married a 16 year old when he was over 30. \n\nIt makes us realize how far we\u2019ve come not to have young girls and boys singing these songs and carrying these earworms and ideas around in their heads. \n\nAnd we should give our culture a lot of credit for this change that this is no longer acceptable and that we can see the song for what it is. It takes a lot to change these kind of entrenched things \u2013 educating and empowering women and giving them goals and meaning beyond being a married mother by 20, a richer socioeconomic status so that kids can stay kids longer, spreading awareness and so on.\n\nIt also should makes us wonder and ask ourselves what we\u2019re doing today because \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d and socially accepted that people a few generations now will be horrified by. I can think of a few things, but it remains to be seen. I just keep telling myself if we can go from cigarette smoke pervading everywhere to now where it\u2019s not even ok in bars any longer than anything is possible.",

Saccharin was the previous most popular artificial sweetener for several decades prior. \n\nIn a nice little bit of trivia, one of the people that came up with the idea for Sweet'n Low, Ben Eisenstadt, was the inventor of the sugar packet.",

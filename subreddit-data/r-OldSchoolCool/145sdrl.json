            "comment": "From a photo series by Bobby Bank, dated May 31, 1977. Pictured are (left to right), Studio 54 owner Steve Rubell, Michael Jackson and Aerosmith lead singer, Steven Tyler. Edited from this shot, to right of Tyler, was Runaways\u2019 lead singer Cherie Currie.\n\nThe date here places this just prior to Aerosmith recording their \u201cDraw The Line,\u201d LP, which Tyler later confessed was a troubled period, due to the group\u2019s members\u2018 excessive drug abuse. Cherie (from the Runaways) was 17 years old at the time, just less than two years into the fame of her band. This was a couple months after their second release, \u201cQueens of Noise,\u201d and just prior to the band\u2019s tour of Japan.\n\nMichael Jackson was about 19 years old, and the Jacksons had left Motown about two years before for CBS/Epic Records. They were soon to release an album, \u201cGoin\u2019 Places,\u201d and some lesser-selling singles during this time.\n\nStudio 54 was one of the cultural focal points of the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s, drawing a dizzying array of actors, musicians and artists. Some of the stars pictured there included names like Cher, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote, Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Jon Peters, and Liza Minnelli.",

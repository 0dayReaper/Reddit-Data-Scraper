A female prisoner pulled a gun away from a guard and shot the guard and possibly others. She was apprehended and pulled away to be executed. All the while the shot guard was laying on the ground screaming in pain and asking why god would do this to him. \n\nIts a really poignant moment in the book. ",

Just imagine having to force a line of people, devastated, defeated and trembling, some of them clutching their children, to dig a hole for themselves. And then shooting them, hopefully killing them the first time, often one by one down the row. Even some of the hardest guards struggled mentally after getting that assignment. Gassing them en masse was less personal. \n\nNot to downplay the pure evil of the Nazis, especially those in the camps, but it's fascinating to me that even with all that hate, and attempts to view Jews and others as less than human, a tiny shred of humanness would sometimes show. Part of their brains, at least for some of them, knew what they were doing was wrong. ",

There were plenty of examples in the past of leaders killing a lot of people, either by poor policies, war, or accidents or some disasters. But there never was a deliberate, well-planned out and assembly-line way of targeting and killing certain groups of people, to wipe them out, motivated by nothing except the hate and orders. It is the chillingness, the \"banality\" of it that is horrifying. And they did it while losing a war. They actually redirected precious resources from defend their country, to killing people.

It's very dangerous to think that Germans were just evil at core and thats why stuff happened. And dismiss the fact that it could happen anywhere, even in US under right circumstances. I mean...modern slavery, eugenics program in 20th century and such US did is a good example of that.\n\nI am from Czech Republic and one of our main national identities is to never forget about holocaust in brutal detail and without bias. Just going through high school education we visited 4 concentration camps across EU, including the museums. It's important to remember how such horrible thing was allowed to happen in modern world.",

Resulting in some of those \u201cwell it\u2019s too late to back out now\u201d situations.\n\nNot saying that this movie portrays a sympathetic view of nazis but it humanises something that many people don\u2019t realise was easy enough to get caught up in.

I think there were almost 3,000 people killed in 3 days. German soldiers came to watch and photograph the victims being shot, which is why the killings were so well documented. A record of some of the images still exists because an electrician managed to steal them and make copies. They were used in the Nuremberg trials and they're truly shocking.",

They were constantly verbally abused by the seniors and were incredibly frustrated themselves. This was by design since they were not even allowed to speak or socialise with the prisoners. This made them extra cruel, they had to vent out their frustrations and the camp prisoners became the easy target. \nYou\u2019re also correct, doctors did report poor mental health of soldiers who had to constantly shoot kids, women, and old people. This resulted in the widespread use of gas vans, where around 100 people could be gassed on their way to the dig site where they were buried. The even more fucked up part was, gas chambers were first formed with the intention to gas the handicapped and mentally challenged Germans. ",

I'm not entirely sure though, because I don't recall any mentions of Male servants in Vahalla in the Prose Edda. I do believe that, according to Roman sources, Celtic and Gallic headhunting tribes kept the heads of slain enemies to secure their service and subjugation in the afterlife. This belief, based on what I've read, is prevalent in accounts of more recent headhunting peoples in the Pacific and Asia, so it seems to be quite common.  \n\nAlso the myths depicting Odin consulting Mimir's pickled severed head for wisdom also points to this, as well as towards a possible thread of continuity between the Norse beliefs and the proto-germanic and Celtic/Gallic beliefs.  \n\nSo, imagine those two guys waiting on Doc Benefold hand and foot, bringing what I can only assume to be an endless supply of Copenhagen and porno mags (or whatever it is that corpsmen like) in Valhalla.  \n\nWho knows, could be true.",

Most are pretty good, filling in the blanks left by the fact that the cultures they came from were mostly illiterate, or at least rarely left written records. For this, I reccomend *The Norse Myths* by Kevin Crossley-holland. That's where I started at when I was still in the Marine corps.  \n\nIf you want a much better understanding, albeit possibly a bit more challenging, the primary sources are obviously going to be your best bet. About 99% of our knowledge of Norse mythology comes from Snorri Sturluson, in his Prose and Poetic Eddas. For the Poetic Edda, I suggest Jackson Crawford's version.  He's a linguist and subject matter expert, he also has an excellent YouTube channel and graduated from my University. For the Prose Edda, the Everyman's edition is really good, with a lot of supplemental information. I also suggest *Egil's Saga* and *The Vulsunga Saga*. For those, the Penguin Classics are very good.  \n  \nSince getting most of our information from Snorri, who was a Christian writing in the twelfth century, isn't the best way to research the subject,  we have to pay attention to other sources as well. The text of Ibn Fadlan is where we get the most in-depth description of a Viking ship burial. We get another description of a burial in the opening section of *Beowulf*.  You'll be surprised where you'll find little extra tidbits of information we can extrapolate from.  \n\nI hope that helps! I'm sure you probably wouldn't want to do this, but I can also suggest learning Old Icelandic. It's surprisingly easy,  especially if you already know German or another similar language. I did it in a 1 semester-long class and, although I can't say that I can speak it, but I can read it pretty okay, and have read a few of the primary sources in their original language. For this, I suggest *An Introduction to Old Norse* by E. V. Gordon.   \n\nThanks for reading! ",

I understand that the purpose of religion is to have everyone believe the same (pledge of allegiance) and have a controllable compliant population. I want to read more about the Norse religion.",

The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising occurred in 1943.  The Germans began to \"deport\" the remaining Jewish residents of the ghetto in Warsaw, and they rebelled.  The vast majority either died in the fighting, or were ultimately captured and sent to the camps and killed there.  This was very much a \"decide to die fighting\" sort of rebellion.\n\nThe Warsaw Uprising, on the other hand, was an uprising by the non-Jewish resistance in the city when Soviet forces were approaching and the German army was being defeated.  This rebellion had serious chance of success, partly because of the weakened position of the German army, partly because it was simply much bigger.  It successfully controlled much of Warsaw before its eventual defeat (in no small part because of Soviet inaction).",

There were checkpoint guards everywhere. At one point very near the destination, one of them took my mom deep into the woods where it\u2019s notoriously known women get raped and killed there. The guard told her to get undressed, but she bolted off while the guard shot his riffle at her. She kept running, told me she had her eyes closed while hearing the gunshots, said to herself that she rather die running than after getting raped. Thankfully a Good Samaritan on a motorbike heard the shots and saw my mom, took her back all the way to the border, reunited with her sister and rest of the people from the carriage smuggling her.\n\nThere\u2019s a longer version of that story, but this part will always stick with me.",

Their brutality is brave and inspiring. \n\n\u201cAccording to Tabau, the shots served as a signal for the other women to attack the SS men; one SS man had his nose torn off, and another was scalped. However, accounts vary: in some Schillinger and Emmerich are the only casualties. Reinforcements were summoned and the camp commander, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, came with other SS men carrying machine guns and grenades. According to Filip Mueller, all people not yet inside the gas chamber were mowed down by machine guns. Other mentioned outcomes are the Jewish women being herded into the gas chamber, taken outside and executed, or Franceska taking her own life with the stolen pistol. Due to various conflicting accounts, it is unclear what truly happened next; the only things that are certain are on that day Schillinger died, Emmerich was wounded, and all the Jewish women were killed.\u201d (Wikipedia)\n\n",

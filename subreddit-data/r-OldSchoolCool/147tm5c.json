            "comment": "He never aged beyond 100.\n\n&gt;The exact age of John Smith at the time of his death has been a subject of controversy. Federal Commissioner of Indian Enrollment Ransom J. Powell argued that \"it was disease and not age that made him look the way he did\" and remarked that according to records he was 88 years old. Paul Buffalo, who had met Smith when a small boy, said he had repeatedly heard the old man state that he was \"seven or eight\", \"eight or nine\" and \"ten years old\" when the \"stars fell\" in the Leonid meteor shower of November 13, 1833. Local historian Carl Zapffe writes:\n\n&gt;\"Birthdates of Indians of the 19th Century had generally been determined by the Government in relation to the awe-inspiring shower of meteorites that burned through the American skies just before dawn on 13 November 1833, scaring the daylights out of civilized and uncivilized peoples alike. Obviously it was the end of the world. . . .\".\n\n&gt;This estimate tied to the Leonids implies the oldest possible age of John Smith at just under 100 years at the time of his death.",

But darker complexion protects A LOT, have few friends that are very slightly darker, and they have no problems with the sun. \n\nBlack people undoubtedly aren't immune to the sun.

They chuckled and said they would be fine. \n\nI saw them later and they were very much the worse for wear; they sighed \u2018yeah, yeah, yuk it up, a fucking sunburned person from Ghana.\u2019 \n\nSo\u2026not necessarily the case that a Black person doesn\u2019t have to protect themselves from that thing that\u2019s in the sky every single day. \n\nPS: she was even worse off the next day.

That means she used to take me blueberry picking when she was older than 100! \n\nAnd for those of you wondering why Ojibwe has Chippewa in parentheses, it\u2019s because the former is typically used by Canadians and the latter is often used by Americans. However, both are misnomers given to us by colonists, and those words mean \u201cpuckered\u201d either in reference to our lips or our moccasins. We call ourselves Anishinabe.",

No offense to the native americans, but no human ever got close to this age of 137, the human, a lady with the longest confirmed lifespan only made it to 122 years. Considering the fact that men don't live that long like women do, it's highly unlikely that he was that old. Maybe he was around \\~100 years, but i doubt it that it was much more.\n\nFor the statistics, self claimed age doesn't count, only what can be confirmed with things like birth certificates and other records.",

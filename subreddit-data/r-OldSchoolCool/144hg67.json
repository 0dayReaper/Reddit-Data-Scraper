I could be wrong though but I\u2019ve heard of stories like this with wrestlers who play bad guys still heeling it up in public. There was this story once about Roddy Piper in a hotel bar with another wrestler and this little kid came up to Roddy asking for an autograph. He was still a heel at the time so apparently he took the paper, crumbled it up and tossed it and told the kid to scram. The other wrestler (who I\u2019m forgetting) asked Piper why\u2019d he do that and Piper said something along the lines of \u201cDo you think that\u2019s not nosed kid is gonna keep that piece of paper? No. But he\u2019s ALWAYS gonna remember what Rowdy Roddy Piper did to him on this day!\u201d I think Cleese comes from the same ilk",

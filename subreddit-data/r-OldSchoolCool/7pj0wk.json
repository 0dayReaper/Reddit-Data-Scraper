I went to one of her panels and got the chance to talk to her afterwards- out of all the designers I met at the conference, she was by far the most personable and she was just chuffed when I told her how much her designs had encouraged me, as a designer myself. Getting to talk with her for a while about her creative process was amazing, she seriously was one of those people who loves what they do and is clearly brilliant, but is so comfortable talking with you about it and mentions things in such a humble, laid-back way that you have to really understand the significance of what she is saying because she just does not brag at all. Seriously an amazing woman. ",

This has me wondering how often professors and schools steal students' work in colleges everywhere, without crediting the students...I remember once being told I couldn't use parts of my own previous work in a new assignment or it would be considered plagiarism. Not only is that completely absurd on its own, their explanation was essentially that the work was the possession of the school after its been submitted. I fought hard against that bullshit and they wouldn't budge. Now I see what their end goal is. What a fucking sick, twisted world we live in.",

That being said...\n\nOnly about 25% of their shoes are made in America. Even then a lot of the raw material is Chinese or other. The fact that they are only 'mostly' made in America actually set off a legal battle. Naturally the FTC backed down so they can continue saying it. If the shows were made in California they could not say made in America because CA demands 100% of material to be American sourced.\n\nNB is a big company, and they went on record about how Trump would be good for business. So, you know, don't buy the hype if you think you're getting an American shoe. They spend s lot of energy marketing that fact, and it's only 1/4 true.\n\nI give it a decade before they have enough market share they feel comfortable closing all but one ~~marketing factory~~ New England factory.",

Now given the year spread we're seeing a particular consistency, being products that would have been on shelves in 1983 in Japan. Which makes it odd that while you could get Dumper in America in 1983 she would have had to wait an additional two years to get Inferno in the Transformers line and then for some reason decide to specifically buy Metal Lightan, a 1982 figure that wasn't released in America official at all to my knowledge. Then after doing that buy another Japanese outlier that is Monster, I don't know much about Macross/Robotech but I believe Matchbox released the mold in completely different colours in 1985 in America - so that appears to be the original Japanese one...also that box is clearly the Japanese release.\n\nBased on the evidence, no. I'd suggest given the vintage of all the other toys it's probably a Diaclone Fire Engine which while almost identical to Inferno we all know being almost correct doesn't cut it on the internet.",

It was a nice story about someone contacting her for a archive project that they were working on. She responded via email saying that he had already \"helped himself to some of my work\" which was the classic paint bucket icon. And he though it was open source.\n\nHe thought she was pissed at him but ended up giving him a logo/icon that he could use for his project.",

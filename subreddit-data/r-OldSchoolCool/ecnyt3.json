After four years of war with a constant fear of bombs and raids the civilian population in Europa was pretty adept at hiding whenever there were signs of action. The military parades you see images of was not the deliberation of the town but rather the next army units who happened to travel through the village after it had been secured and the front had moved far enough away that the civilians would come out of hiding. I am not saying scenes like this did not happen though, but it was certainly out of action. An army unit stationed in a village would place guards, sentries and lookouts around the perimiter in case of stray enemy units behind the lines. And civilians would often show appreciation of the soldiers by distributing cakes and other food and drink to the soldiers. So a scene like the one depicted did likely happen a lot but the precense of a camera and maybe instructions from the cameraman was likely a huge influence in the scene.",

He may not have been in that particular position unless he was specifically told to provide cover for another area. There was also a photographer in the area that saw an opportunity, so they staged the shot. Completely unstaged photographs of people doing specific things outside of sports photography are incredibly rare.\n\nFrom what I understand, hospitality from occupied civilians towards their potential liberators was not rare, but these sort of picture perfect moments were likely staged.\n\nI was assigned to a few different squadrons that were uniques 'firsts' during my time in the navy. at each of them there were times when we were told that we would be photographed working on the aircraft, so we would be saving a bunch of scheduled inspections to be done at the same time to provide a better photograph. Despite staging an unrealistic amount of maintenance to be done at the same time for the photograph, it was not interesting enough for the photographers, so we had to stage even further actions. If you come across any promotional pictures from Sikorsky, or Lockheed Martin of the MH-60R helicopter being worked on in broad daylight and there are flashlights being used in every picture despite it being broad daylight, you are welcome.",

My grandfather also used to loot Nazi memorabilia off dead soldiers. One time he came across a soldier that had crashed his plane.

My grandfather was eventually moved to stay with relatives elsewhere by hitching a ride in a meat truck, spending hours among a shitload of beef until he arrived. He turned out pretty ok too. Dated Brigitte Bardot before she got famous, became the President of French Line and hosted the likes of Elton John and Carey Grant on the SS France, got married 5 times, lived in Tahiti for his last 20ish years, raised a child during that time, and was just the coolest guy.",

France collapsed because their armies were crushed in the field and their leadership had been fraught with factionalism for decades (France had something like 7 different Presidents and PMs in WWI).  Not because as a nation they were constitutionally weak",

            "comment": "Hey, can anyone in the know recommend a handful of Monk tunes for me?\n\nOnce upon a time, I played piano - learned some classical and jazz! A friend of mine, who also did keyboards, pulled me aside one day to play a Monk track for me, \"Dude, you gotta check this out.\"\n\nThe syncopation was mind-blowing. It was difficult for my brain to process LOL. I'd spent all this time playing ON the beat, making sure I was \"on time\" with my playing, and here comes dude, dancing around the beat... Kind of just, taunting the listener with his mastery, and an outright refusal to play on the ones, twos, threes, fours, etc! It was simultaneously awe-inspiring and a little bit infuriating!\n\nAnyway, in the intervening years, I've tried to track down some prime-time Monk syncopated rhythmic fuck-shittery and have come up pretty empty. \"Mysterioso\" was NOT it.\n\nSo right, can anyone recommend some deep-cut Monk tracks that showcase his rhythmic/syncopation mastery?",

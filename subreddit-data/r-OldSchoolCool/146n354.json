Zack De La Rocha has spoken out for his beliefs, not to mention on the UN floor. People who do that are typical pretty passionate about their morals. Sometimes art is an amplified, embellished version of what you feel. Symbolism, like a lot of the lyrics in this song, are a perfect example of that\n\nI would personally reserve the term whiny anger for things like people who get mad over a drive thru worker, forgetting ketchup packets and such.",

It's a little heavier but I've always considered Rage Against Machine Hip Hop with a subversive heavy metal tone. Wu-Tang encompasses a very wide range of artists, affiliations, and musical genres. I've been digging down into the history and backstory of Wu-Tang. I'm really enjoying RZA as Bobby Digital; The song Sickness and also Mantis are really good.",

Needless to say we were glad we didn\u2019t. It\u2019s the only time in my life I\u2019ve ended up headbanging and shouting along to a song I\u2019d never heard before.

I had no regrets at the time and saw RATM later in the 90's.  You caught snippets of the side stage as they switched out sets.\n\n.\n\nI still say 1991 was the best simply because of the novelty of it.  I saw it at Tinley in Chicago and it still blows my mind how good it was and how strange the crowd was.  Watching a 20 minute version of 'Summertime Rolls' by Jane's Addiction in a 10,000 person circular mosh pit in the lawn is one for the books.  There's a reason Jane's was the Grateful Dead's favorite band of the 90's.\n\n.\n\nI missed 1993 with Tool and RATM on the mainstage but I've seen Primus and Fishbone together like 10 times, because they just kept touring together and there are no 2 better live bands than those 2.  RATM didn't mix it up enough and played their albums in the early years.",

While Zach was raging and Tom was wailing away, Tim &amp;  Brad were making everyone want shake their booties (or thrash around like lunatics) Lol. Together they were the coolest thing about RATM for this girl.",

They changed all their songs to sound like the newer albums. All the hard stuff was ruined with weird vocals that aren't in the older songs. I actually left during their show.

It was originally supposed to be in St Paul but it was the same date and city as the republican national convention and the authorities said \"nope\" and moved it to Minneapolis lol. They had a \"fuck RNC\" sign up the entire time. And afterwards they moved people in groups. My friends and I got \"detained\" for a half hour. Which probably was illegal lol. But they wanted to make sure nothing went down. It was surreal. One of the best shows ever. Would have killed to see them in the 90s though!",

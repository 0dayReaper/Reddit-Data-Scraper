After basic training, she served as a typist at Marine headquarters in Washington, D.C. In June 1943, the Marine Corps accepted her transfer request to the Motor Transport School at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Frankel then worked as a truck driver and dispatcher in Cherry Point, North Carolina, between 1944 and 1945. She was honorably discharged at the rank of staff sergeant in September 1945.",

That sort of thing is more networking than nepotism.  Sure, it's not exactly fair that some people don't have to put the same effort into networking, but usually, family only gets you access and a chance to prove yourself.\n\nIMO, real nepotism is where someone obtains, **and more importantly maintains,** a career based primarily upon who they are related to, regardless of their actual abilities and capabilities.",

Another often glanced over fact when \u201cnepotism\u201d is sneered as a slur is that, with exceedingly few exceptions, and in part because of the notion that it\u2019s easier on those with family ties \u2014 the vast majority of people with those ties may have an easier time getting the initial foot in the door, but then they have to bust their asses 2-3x harder than the best-of-the-rest just to prove that they\u2019re not there for that reason alone. Those who work around them already look down on those with the connections, but tend also to carry that perception into everything that person does once they\u2019re there. \n\nAt the end of the day, with most jobs worth fighting over, \u201cluck\u201d \u2014 which is to say, truly random happenstance \u2014 plays some part in the way every person ends up in that position. From that point on, it\u2019s generally a matter of hard work and managing the expectations of others that keeps you there unless you\u2019re the constantly pampered type who always has someone around to pick up all the pieces when you break something \u2014 like Jarod Kushner and his ilk.",

During the \"interwar\" years between 1918 and 1939 the U.S. armed forces were very small compared to today.  Several famous Marine officers (notably LT GEN Lewis B. \"Chesty\" Puller) were discharged after WWI and reenlisted as privates.  (Puller did not see combat during WWI, he was in OCS. \n After 1919 he was reduced in rank from lieutenant to corporal and placed on \"inactive\" status.)  The Marine Corps was reduced in size from 73,000 to 27,400.\nPuller was reactivated and fought during the Banana Wars in Haiti and Nicaragua and was then posted to Beijing, China, where he commanded a detachment of \"China Marines\" guarding the American Legation, then to Shanghai, and then commanded the ship's platoon on board The *U.S.S. Augusta.*  Shortly before WWII, he was given command of 1/7 (1st battalion, 7th Marine regiment) at New River, North Carolina (which later became Camp Lejeune.)\n\nIn one famous incident in 1921, the miniscule U.S. Marine Corps was given the task of protecting U.S. Mail trains from train robbers.  The commandant stated to the press, \"If a single letter is stolen from a mail car, there had *better* be a dead Marine at his post.\"  The Marines brought machine guns on board mail trains, and train robberies ceased.",

Bea Arthur herself would say she was never in the military (she denied military service all the time), and she would be right; the Women's Reserve wasn't actually part of the military itself, just a supporting service associated with the military.\n\nEdit: I've been corrected, the auxiliary services for women were officially brought into their respective military services in 1943, and Bea Arthur's service began in 1944. So while she wasn't a precisely a Marine, she still served in the military during the war and was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant in 1945.",

They held down the same jobs as the men that held them before they were reassigned into combat duty to free them up for war. \n\nSure they may have had desk jobs or tasks that didn\u2019t require picking up a gun, but they had ranks, training camps, drill sergeants, knew how to fix engines, assemble 50 cal guns, and other jobs on bases normally performed by men. \n\nBy 1948 the Women\u2019s Armed Forces Act was signed into law and allowed women to serve regular duties they had largely been removed from after WWII. \n\nEven General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, had initially been opposed to having women serve in the Marine Corps. However, before the end of 1943, he had reversed himself, saying:\n\n\"Like most Marines, when the matter first came up I didn't believe women could serve any useful purpose in the Marine Corps ... Since then I've changed my mind.\"",

Tune the string to the main note, then flip the cam, adjust the cam to get the desire second note, and then you can flip back and forth between them at will.\n\nHe invented them I believe. The concept was later improved by Bill Keith who built tuners that could do the same thing without having the extra hardware on your headstock.",

I\u2019m more drawn to the folk-like styles of country, and some western, Appalachian, and bluegrass. What I sometimes refer to as goat-roper pop - the silly lyrics and sound-alike, good old boy vocals - is mostly just awful to my ears.\nThis \u201croots\u201d music, however, is pure and full of joy.",

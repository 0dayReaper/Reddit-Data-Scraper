I think every social justice movement since the early 2010's has been like waves eroding a beach and the last few years is when the cliff broke away and chaos really started. I think the whole \"someone told them to care\" has been happening with a lot of movements since social media really became the norm. When debates about serious social issues are all had on twitter it's an inevitable mess waiting to happen. And you don't know who you're arguing with. Might be an out of touch 80 year old. Might be a 12 year old who shouldn't even have a social media account to begin with. \n\nIt's also put politicians in a mess because rather than actually interacting with their constituents they rely on trawling social media posts when making their decisions on how to market themselves. Then when it backfires they're baffled. And I'm not saying this as if I'm somehow exempt. When I was growing up I was convinced everyone was pro-choice because that's what my eco chambers told me. But when the voting and debates finally started to happen I suddenly realised how wrong I was.",

The option to just ignore things you don't agree with seems gone now. Everybody is asked to either speak out and advocate or branded as hateful or a fake ally and that goes for more than just the trans/drag discussions.

Before social media people were less likely to be exposed to extreme sides of an argument. You'd discuss things with the people in your bubble and unless your bubble is full of extreme people you were unlikely to develop those views naturally. Now everything is all or nothing. \n\nYou cant have a nuanced discussion about anything whether that's social issues or something trivial like a TV show. Either it's the best thing you've ever seen or it's the biggest piece of trash ever made. Either you're an over ally or you're a hateful Nazi. Both sides will cannibalise their supporters for questioning something. Look at how Biden felt comfortable saying \"if you don't vote for me are you even black?\". As If a black person who was on the fence of voting for Biden would somehow be a \"race traitor\". I think it's a dangerous principle that turns any potential debate or discussion into a dumpster fire of identity politics. I'm sure there are gonna be people who read my comment and label me a Nazi apologist or \"MAGA Man\" or something",

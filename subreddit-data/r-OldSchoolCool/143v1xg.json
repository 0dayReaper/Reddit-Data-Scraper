Most people would go up to weird Al after and tell him it was a joke and they\u2019d laugh but Prince wouldn\u2019t, he\u2019d live the joke the next 20 years. Now he has a thing with Weird Al where weird Al thinks he can\u2019t look him in the eye. Hilarious. He\u2019d usually tell the person he was just kidding like 20 years later at some party or something, and act totally normal and nice to them and become friends, there\u2019s a bunch of this in his history.",

For the pieces he never did that 80% of the work on this leaves us now hearing something very rough, an idea of an idea, or someone else doing the other 80% of the work which makes it not exactly Prince. \n\nWe cannot circumvent the uncomfortable idea that death leaves us with unfinished work.",

When I was about 10 years old I got a cassette tape, the Batman movie soundtrack. I listened to that thing non-stop. Back then I didn't really know who Prince was, I just loved his music, loved the soundtrack.\n\nI was a weird kid who wasn't really allowed to listen to non-Christian music until I was an older teenager but I knew every song by Prince on that cassette. I still don't know why my parents let me listen to it but I'm glad they did.",

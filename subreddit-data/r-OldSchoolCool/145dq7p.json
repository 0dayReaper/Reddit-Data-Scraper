Hopefully this time with a more primary and secondary color palette then the bizarre ugly yellows and greens and browns of the 70s. I feel like the perfect style is a mix of the bright colors and modernist design sense of the mid-1960s withthe comfortable, almost lounge lizard, overstuffed couch and Woodgrain look of the 1970s.",

But what I remember are the family homes that were styled like this, and unless it was some kind of dirtbag family, they never smelled like pot or incense or anything like that.

The predominant odors were whatever foods people tended to cook in that household, and the smell of the Scotchgard protected fabrics and carpets.",

I remember one of the cooler ones I had was Led Zeppelin\u2019s, \u201cIn Through the Out Door\u201d. We figured out that there were at least two different Photo\u2019s used for the cover of that album because my buddy had the same album with shots taken at a different angle of the guy setting at the old bar. Then when you opened it up and took a damp sponge to the inner jacket it would turn to a color picture. I went and bought another album just so I could color one and keep the other black and white. Super cool stuff! They got very creative with those album covers back in the day.",

They were developed that way because they ALWAYS came out and people paid by the good PHOTO. So if you got back 24 of 24 you paid for 24. If you only got 13 you only got 13. You could sometimes get 26 out of it! To do a better job we risked ruining the risky ones. \nFun fact, if you went anywhere POPULAR- like the Tall Ships, Statue of Liberty etc we had piles of copies of \" good,\" not great ones of the same thing we had already developed for someone else. There are thousands of folks with the same pictures. Kept them happy and made us $. \nAnd yes, we saw your \" nudes\" if they were good and obvious. We actually had a lady  who would decide if they were 1) okay to send back 2) too dirty or obscene 3) call the police. Lol!",

There were different sized shelves and boxes above them to hold all of the stereo components.  \n\nI loved to babysit for them because I could listen to anything I wanted, and their two kids were absolute angels.

He always hooked us up with a top of the line exterior TV antenna.  Even after my parents got divorced, he still made sure we had a great one.\n\nCable was well underway in most urban and suburban areas by the the mid 70s though.  My cousins that lived in town had cable in 75 with the wired control box.  It had a row of twenty rocker switches to get up to 40 stations.  It blew my adolescent mind to be able to watch cartoons on a weekday.  \n\nBy the time my mother remarried in 78, and we moved in town, HBO was blowing up.  My mom talked my stepfather into getting cable just to watch Red Sox games.  Previously he listened to them on the radio.  He wasn't even aware he could watch the games on cable.  He was so pleased to be able to watch games, he let her add on HBO.",

I was stolen, \u201csold\u201d for profit, my siblings were \u201csold\u201d for profit\u2026 and we weren\u2019t sold to good people. Now not all foster parents are bad, but most of the ones that knows exactly what they are signing up for\u2026 aren\u2019t good. But that\u2019s a story for another day I suppose\u2026",

I know of couples who keep taking on more and more to increase their income.\n\nYep, folks, this happens.  It's not hard for me to imagine that there were folks in Florida during the 80's that were bribing officials to get placements, and then that sweet monthly check.\n\nIt's the trailer park lottery.  Get yourself on disability then take on some foster kids.  You just have to be good at acting responsible for meetings with social workers and clean up the place before they arrive.  Even better, once you get in good with the system, they'll find you a free Section 8 place to live.\n\nOf course, if the social worker is part of the grift in the first place, all the better.",

He murdered a 6yr old boy they were fostering. How the Hell he was approved is beyond me. He wasn't violent in school, but something about him made me think I would never want to be alone with him. He was quiet, odd, and would stare intensely at girls during class. He couldn't follow simple instructions from the teacher during lectures, had trouble reading and comprehending what he read, Forgetful...etc\n\nYet he was allowed to be a foster parent for special needs kids which apparently pays more money. You can google him and his story pops up.",

I pressed her on this and asked her isn\u2019t the point to get the kids to go home or to good foster families?  She agreed but said that if they don\u2019t have enough intakes they\u2019ll have to do layoffs.\n\nNow to the places credit and my moms, it sounds like they provide a good place for them and my mom legitimately cares for those kids and is always looking for ways to make their days better by taking them on \u201cfield trips\u201d to Astros games and stuff like that, but the way she said that was very unsettling to me.",

So they are placing children in adult mental institutions to live with because they don\u2019t have the placement. I remember the \u201ctransitions unit\u201d was right next door to the \u201cASAP unit\u201d. The \u201cASAP unit\u201d was a unit strictly for mentally I\u2019ll sex offenders. I remember being forced to walk past them and even sit with them in the cafeteria there. That place eventually ended up getting shut down by the time I was aged out. Not for the sex offender situation, but for the abuse that went down there. So many children would get scared and cried about being taken from their families, and the staff would handle it like you were crazy. Inject you with haldol and make you sleep it off. Threw you down on blue mats and injected you for almost anything that wasn\u2019t sitting still. So, the bad places eventually do get investigated and taken out\u2026 but people have to speak for this to happen, and it just takes a long time. Not many want to talk about their experiences, and even I was like that for a long time.",

Meanwhile, the first I met\u2026 took away my cd player I had (which was all I had and the clothes in my back) and gave it to her son right in front of me because the cd I was listening to wasn\u2019t appropriate for a minor. Even a GAL I had was new, I was her first client, and she quit 2 weeks later. No reason given and I actually liked her. Although, I don\u2019t know anything about what she went through and why she would leave. I just remember she was too nice and that\u2019s probably why. Corrupt CPS is very real, and people are speaking more and more about it. Again, not saying there isn\u2019t any good workers out there\u2026 but these days, they get rid of the people going in with the best intentions and that genuinely want to help save kids. That\u2019s not what they are there for\u2026 There are groups on Facebook of people posting cps workers coming to their homes and removing their children by force for a dumbest reasons and without any evidence. CPS doesn\u2019t seem to need evidence. They really do act above the law, and entitled to what they\u2019re doing. Like families aren\u2019t gonna fight for their children, and just surrender them no questions asked. If parents fight too hard or show too much emotion about their children\u2026 then they are \u201cmentally unstable\u201d and deemed not safe environment to be returned. These families make the post not necessarily to \u201cexpose\u201d, but to try to get help and support from one another as to how to save their children. How can they legitimately protect their children from their state, which seems to be a dead end. The best advice that\u2019s given is to simply not let them in your home, once they step foot past the threshold, it\u2019s a done deal. \u201cLegal kidnapping\u201d. We didn\u2019t have cellphones to easily record the corruption and speak out back then, but now it\u2019s there\u2026 so little by little people are exposing it while trying to get help. But the system has a god complex\u2026 it\u2019s very hard to expose, and fight against them. Now there\u2019s more children then they can manage\u2026 but they still won\u2019t stop. Money is the root of evil, and now and days\u2026 \u2018majority\u2019 are in it for the money. Case workers, cps workers, foster parents, etc.",

                    "comment": "Yes. Many of the case managers get paid for every child they take. That\u2019s why they work so hard to remove a child once a case is open. The state and the case managers will make a \u201cparent plan\u201d with close to impossible requirements depending on a persons situation, with \u201cx\u201d amount of time to fulfill the requirements. They typically prey on the poor. The state gets funded as well for these removals. Obviously everyone in the courthouse is getting paid as well for however long it takes them to strip a parent of their parental rights. So that can go on for years till they are successful, or the parent terminates their parental rights after they can\u2019t take the hardship/threats anymore. Foster parents receive a check every month to house them\u2026 the child is suppose to receive a check for \u201cbasic hygiene and necessities\u201d of which I know I never received cause the foster parents would take it for themselves. I didn\u2019t even know that check for hygiene and clothes existed till I was 17 and was finally placed with a REALLY good foster parent and she explained it all to me. But many of the foster parents I was housed with were not good people\u2026 I remember my first one. We were all lined up in some fancy rented out Hall. Lots of elderly people there at tables with white table clothes. A bunch of us kids dressed up\u2026 stockings, baby dolls dresses, and baby doll shoes\u2026. We were told to walk around the tables and smile at the guest. To be sweet and nice. After that, I went home with a couple. I lived with them for a few months and was adopted by them by the bed of that year. After adoption was over, I was turned into a child laborer (and I don\u2019t mean just doing a few chores I didn\u2019t want to do\u2026 they had 10 acres of land, a farm, a two story 6 bedroom home and the kids including myself had to maintain it and the farm. Mow the entire lawn, weed whack, maintain their pool, care for each other, make our own food (which was just dinner), and many other things that I always felt was a lot for toddlers, kids, Down syndrome kids, kids with walkers, etc. You did things things as you were instructed with no mistakes, mistakes costed you flesh. This particular person had 5 sometimes 6 of us at a time, and she adopted based off obedience. Most children that were \u2018minorities\u2019 or \u2018special needs\u2019 such as a Down syndrome child\u2026 people got paid more for them. There were no white children here. The only white people were my adoptive parents\u2026 I was considered \u201cspecial needs\u201d for the longest time and I don\u2019t even know why. Nothing physical or even mental (by then) was wrong with me\u2026 but I think they label all kids as \u201cspecial needs\u201d so they can all get paid more tbh. It\u2019s all too much to go through, and really hard to explain on a Reddit thread. But I did my best. My adoptive parents eventually terminated their rights by the time I was 11, due to issues with obedience. I was homeschooled till the state pretty much forced her to put us in public school, then I also started to question genes and traits too much as my adoptive mom in particular always told me she was my birth mom. By 4th grade science class, I started to pick up that wasn\u2019t true. I asked questions, got slapped for it, and eventually just didn\u2019t need to ask anymore. Rebelled ever since, so I became of no use to her anymore and she gave me back. But I also think she caught on to me trying to kill her. Who knows.",

I was given 8 epinephrine injections, and it kept returning so they were discussing with me about intubation if it kept progressing. I was supposed to be monitored until I was cleared to go home. Still no idea what caused it. I didn't eat breakfast that morning, still did my usual thing and nothing different...etc\n\nAnyways, I had the doctor call my daughter's school to notify what happened, since my husband was in Quatar for business. My back up (bff and next door neighbors were in Rome for a destination wedding, and 2nd alternate contact were not home. They told me CPS will have to remove my daughter.....but I will have to PROVE I am a fit parent to get her back! What the fuck?!\n\nIt was just a bad collection of circumstances: husband away for work out of the country, Im in the hospital, friend who is listed as able to pick her up out of the country for the week, 2nd unable to contact her, a 3rd friend who agreed to get her wasn't allowed to pick her up because she wasn't on the \"school pick up list.\" Even though I was on the phone with the school saying its fine. \n\n\nI had to sign out AMA from the hospital, get a friend to drive me home, and collect my kid or CPS would take her. At that point, Im still covered in hives, and my throat still tight. I had 2 extra epi pens they gave me just in case. \n\nThey said it could \"take awhile\" to prove to CPS I am fit to keep her if I wasn't able to pick her up from school.\n\nNever in my life have I felt so violated. My child never had any health issues, not a scratch on her, healthy, and happy. We live in a nice area and are wealthy. So I totally believe CPS is capable of legally kidnapping kids. I am thankful if something like that happened, I have the financial means to fight it. \n\nIf I was a single mom and money was tight, I think my daughter would of been removed. She probably would've been placed in some poorly vetted foster home, where she would of been abused. While CPS continued their circle jerk session of \"saving another child.\"",

No one is gonna be privy to the state\u2019s side of the story\u2026 they will never voluntarily let that cat it out of the bag. So, I can only tell me, and my (both sides) family\u2019s side, which\u2026 by the way\u2026 I\u2019ve never claimed this is how the entire system works, nor have I claimed that everyone in the entire state of Florida get the same treatment we did. There\u2019s different variations and circumstances for every case. But I can tell you that laws have always worked the way they do, that\u2019s nothing new. Just because something is \u201clegalized\u201d, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s accepted. Example, interracial relationships\u2026 just because they were \u201clegal\u201d; doesn\u2019t mean people enjoyed seeing them. It\u2019s still like that even now, but now it\u2019s not just interracial relationships\u2026 another example, the LGBTQ relationships still get hit just as hard, and they\u2019re also \u201clegal\u201d. Also CPS does not need to provide proof, but that a separate rabbit hole I\u2019m sure you\u2019re capable enough to google. You can start with CPS corruption, but we both know you\u2019re too close minded for that. You\u2019re firm on your beliefs, and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019m not here to shake people on their perspective of the world, I\u2019m here to find others that have been through it. You don\u2019t know, unless you were there.",

I have seen horrible placements, overworked social workers with not enough time to visit all their kids and social workers who just didn't care anymore.\n\nI've seen birth parents who had child after child to abuse and neglect again and again to the point that the county would just show up at the hospital and take custody of the newborn rather than wait for the child to be the newest victim of the parents who have been given every resource, class and support known to mankind and still choose to be neglectful, abusive pieces of shit.\n\nI've seen social workers refuse to allow good foster family adopt a child they've had from 3 months to 5 years old because they want to try reunification.  Only to have that child be abused and neglected as soon as it was placed back with the biological family. Then said social workers bounced the child around for a bit before approaching the original foster family to adopt. Who paid the price? The child, of course.\n\nI've seen blatant racism in decision making to remove children from homes or keep them from returning to homes. I've seen decisions made because Mom was \"white trash\" or had an attitude or didn't show enough humbleness or asked too many questions. Well yeah it's her kids she has every right to ask questions,  have an attitude, be honest etc.\n\nOh and once you're 18, fuck off, no support for you. Go and figure it out by yourself. No money, no savings, no safety net, no family connections because the system made sure all of that has been ripped from you.\n\nIn essence you have been sold to the system as a money maker for the foster parents.",

When you sell something, the person who buys that thing doesn't make money off the sale.",

Yes, of course there are times when children really are in danger and need to be re-homed, but there is a deep and dark underbelly to this system. Medical kidnapping, racial discrimination, the list goes on. It really disturbs me when people celebrate a foster adoption \u201cwe\u2019ve prayed for you for so long\u201d or \u201cwe are finally parents!\u201d But nobody stops to think about how this child was taken from parents or a parent whom they loved, they don\u2019t understand. And yes, sometimes this is necessary, but people forget the ultimate goal is for reunification of biological parents and their children. It\u2019s not about you finally being a parent or you \u201cdoing right\u201d by \u201chelping\u201d a child \u201cin need.\u201d",

                    "comment": "And tbh, I know most people especially the ones that haven\u2019t lived it, haven\u2019t experienced it, or speak about their cousin, sister in law, fathers friend, bosses wife, or whoever that speaks about it and doesn\u2019t know the full extent from the inside-out\u2026 won\u2019t believe it. Hell, I was in denial for years, and didn\u2019t believe half of what I was seeing and experiencing myself\u2026 and I was there. I even believed their nonsense, and I was living it and it contradicted everything they preached about. They removed us very quickly, the case went very fast, court hearing were rapid, parents couldn\u2019t cry or get upset or they would flip that into something awful like deeming them \u201cemotionally or mentally unstable\u201d. There are children that need to be removed from their parents no doubt, but CPS lately are too busy putting the resources towards calls from someone upset at someone else and trying to cause issues for them for no reason, or taking children from the poor who can\u2019t afford to fight so it\u2019s easier to remove them. They are also removing from the ones who can afford a lawyer or two to get them back. Everyday we read about those kids later that were killed in their homes, foster homes, adoptive homes, group homes, etc but CPS wasn\u2019t anywhere near the situation and didn\u2019t see the red flags, or even worse\u2026 they were there, the lawyers shut them up, they left, and then the kids died or were killed. Happens all the time. I just wonder how many cases there are where it wasn\u2019t publicized.",

Stop kids from getting hurt by their parents, and to protect the kids. They gained the public\u2019s trust with that, and in the beginning, THAT was why they were there. But it\u2019s transformed over the decades into a monster\u2026 and dare I say it, a money printing machine\u2026 although some may \u201cjoin the force\u201d now for that reason - to save children, it\u2019s no longer what it was in the beginning. It\u2019s like the police\u2026 there\u2019s some good ones that actually do care, but there also a lot of bad and corrupt ones. Same thing applies to CPS workers, case managers, and foster parents, etc. Evil seems to be winning even more in terms of that these days\u2026",

            "comment": "FL DCF is horrible. There was a case a few years ago (less than 7) where a young girl was removed from her home and put with an aunt. DCF was supposed to check in every week. Well, two years went by. A new case worker started asking questions and received no answers from the family. This case made regional news. Then, a search warrant was issued. They found the poor thing in a contractors bag in a locked chest freezer in the garage.\n\nMy wife and I considered becoming foster parents when we were on the local board for a national charity. A LEO friend of ours talked us out it. Then we started seeing how fundamentally broken DCF is, even in the very affluent neighborhoods in our area. I\u2019d trust a street addict with my life savings more than Florida with a kid.\n\n\nEdit: I just spoke with my wife, it was 8 years ago and the girl was returned to her mother after a short period with the aunt. Mom suffered a savage beating in the county jail after being booked.",

She has a very cool way of breaking down past and even current behaviors I have. Obviously abandonment issues are a big one, but I\u2019m slowly getting there. The same way I can\u2019t put down every detail of everything that happened in a Reddit post, is the same way I can\u2019t get through all of it in a single session. But I\u2019m doing ok. The only reason I brought this to the table, was because I KNOW there are others that have experienced the same if not similar experience. The only purpose was to let those people know it wasn\u2019t just them\u2026 but I also has no idea Reddit was so conservative. Maybe that\u2019s why I never thought about posting here lol! But I do still speak with my siblings, and we\u2019re still unsure of about 30% of what actually happened. The fact that even we are still in shock and we lived it, is why I don\u2019t expect people to believe it. But thank you for your compassion, and kindness. It\u2019s a rough topic for me for sure.",

But the 80s?!\n\nI can\u2019t get my head around Florida\u2019s legal grounds for removing you from your home.  Crazy.  Do you know what law or code they cited?\n\nI hadn\u2019t considered Reddit conservative but I\u2019m mostly in left-leaning or neutral subs so may be blind to it.\n\nThanks again for the response.

As I stated before, me and my sister (the one holding me in the red) are very close\u2026 the others not so much, but it\u2019s \u201cnot by choice\u201d.

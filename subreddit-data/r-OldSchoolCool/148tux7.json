The beauty of being a pioneer is you have very few shoulders to stand on and the field is wide open. The downside of pioneers is...what if you are close but not correct? We build all subsequent work off of 'close'.\n\nStill I agree it's fun to romanticize the era. Much cooler than a James Dean poster.",

They made a lot of major discoveries, but that was as much a function of the big discoveries that were available to be made at the time, and the large amounts of money be pushed into basic research at the time as it was their intelligence. \n\nThere are a lot of problems being solved today that require as much or more intelligence than this picture, but to the general public, they're just background irrelevant stuff. But these discoveries will change peoples' lives. We just won't have individual intellectual superstars to idolize like these guys.\n\nAlso that last point made me think that part of the problem is, back in the 1920s-40s and maybe into the 50s, western society idolized intellectual people. They were celebrities. All over the papers. At some point, we switched to idolizing sports figures, vapid heiresses, actors, and rich people. I think this is a big part of the reason our western society is in decline.",

            "comment": "When I was going to Fresno State in the early 2000's, we had a professor who was a student at UCLA during the mid 60's when Kareem was there. This professor was tall, about 6'6\" and told us people were very intimidated by him cause of his height. \n\nOne night, while playing pool on UCLA's campus, he was getting ready to re-rack another game, when someone from behind shouted \"I had next buddy...\" Our professor said he turned around, expecting to look down on someone, and instead his face literally hit the chest of another man. \n\nThat man was Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Our professor said, never in his life had he felt so small and insignificant like he did that day.\n\n\"At 6'6\"...never in my life, would I imagine I'd be staring at the chest of another person...\".\n\n\n\n",

One night a separate party had stolen a bottle of vodka from us. I didn't want to jump to conclusions, we later found out it was indeed them. One of our friends, Jim, has a bad habit of escalating situations from the get-go. So he confronts the other party and within 15 seconds everybody is ready for a brawl while I'm caught in the middle trying to wager peace. A member of the other party was sitting in the backseat of their car and gets out to see what the commotion was. Now I'm a fairly tall guy at 6'4\" so it's not very often I'm in a situation where I feel like a god damn midget. But as this guy is getting out of his car, I watch him slowly rise, and rise, and rise before I think to myself 'Oh shit this motherfucker is at least 6'10\"'. So there I am looking up at this guy when he bellows 'Do we have a fucking problem?' and everybody just stops and shuts up. My buddy Jordan breaks the silence and said 'Wasn't my bottle' before turning around and walking back to the apartment. That was the end of it as it was enough to diffuse the situation and leave it as more of a misunderstanding. Dude was pretty cool too and he ended up not beating anyones ass.\n\n",

In the days leading up to the event, they had life-size posters of him and a life-size cardboard cutout. We all know 7'2 is crazy tall, but standing next to that cutout really gives you an idea of tall it really is. \n\nI'm not an insanely tall guy, but at 6' I rarely feel dwarfed. I know a lot of people that are a foot shorter than me, but I don't meet too many people that are over a foot taller than me.",

It's not as if Wooden wouldn't have gotten *most* of the kids himself - afterall, playing for Wooden was a guarantee of both college and pro success. However, if you saw a kid from the other side of the country - see, e.g., Lew Alcindor - \"Papa Sam\" was definitely the reason why. Back then in the 1960s and 1970s very few kids went to school far from home unless the local schools didn't want them or couldn't offer truly competitive basketball. \n\nAnother good example of this is Wilt Chamberlain, who grew up in Philadelphia but played for blue blood Kansas over local schools like Temple. It turned out that Chamberlain was actually playing semi-pro basketball for a number of years while he was in high school and should have been ineligible. Moving halfway across the country was enough to avoid questions.",

Wooden didn't want to piss the kid off so he gave him the last spot and let him ride the pine. He was often overlooked in practice and never play a minute, much to his disappointment.  One of the last games of the season UCLA was getting blown out and the kid says to wooden at half time - coach let me play. I play with my teammates every day for fun. I got game. So wooden wants to shut the kid up and says fine you can start the second half - thinking that he would make a fool of himself and be subbed out in the first minute. Instead the kid goes off and single-handedly won the game. At the press conference somebody exclaims that it was genius to hide his best player until this late in the season! Wooden goes onto say that he wonders how many gems he had hidden on his teams that really never got a fair shake. After that he made sure that everyone on the team would get some burn. ",

Generally this happens in your 30s. \n\nThis is absolutely true for me and everyone I've checked with. The pain may not be severe (often more could be called discomfort), but it's always there in the morning. No matter how well you take care of your body, the parts start to wear and break down by middle age and it only gets worse in time. \n\nI broke my hand in my 20s. Many mornings I can feel a dull ache in that hand. ",

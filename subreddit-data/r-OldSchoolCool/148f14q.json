In the 90s everything was oversized and long. \n\nI'm old so I remember but if you want an easy example, check out photos of Matt Dillon from \"Over the Edge\" in the late 70s and he's wearing a shirt like in the OP. Then check him out in \"Singles\" in the early 90s and he's wearing mostly untucked shirts that are at least a size too large and long.\n\nLike the OP said though, sometimes fashion carried over for people between decades so it's not always a hard and fast rule.",

There are ways to estimate what the colors could have been, especially if you know the exact process used to make the photo and how it alters the grayscale values of different colors compared to each other, but most photos don't come with that sort of info. So it's an artistic guess, often aided by some sort of colorization algorithm these days. You can also use historical paintings and fashion samples that have survived to the present day to guess what color combinations are more or less likely, in clothing,  although idk if OP did that here or not.",

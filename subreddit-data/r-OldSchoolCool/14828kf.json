When photographers showed up she screamed at them if anyone of them took pictures of his face she would personally make it her mission to ruin their careers. He went through extensive plastic surgery and bone surgery. The miraculous end was he was still handsome but looked asymmetrical and haggard which shocked audiences. The accident left him in chronic pain for the rest of his life and drug dependent.",

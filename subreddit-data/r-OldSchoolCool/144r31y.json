She doesn't know me and I only know her vicariously through what i've watched of her, so it's all good.  \n\nSidenote:  *I never said I'd demand a selfie.*  I mentioned talking and *maybe ask for an autograph if she was in a friendly mood.*  \n\nShe's a great and brilliant actress and had a key cultural impact in female empowerment with Thelma &amp; Louise and A League Of Their Own among other favorites, like Beetlejuice.  You can be respectful and ignore her, I'd try to thank her for her work and see where it goes from there....",

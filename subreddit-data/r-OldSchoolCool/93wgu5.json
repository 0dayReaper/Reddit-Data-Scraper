I did this to a couple great photos of my parents when I was little (like, just able to use scissors but probably wasn't supposed to have them) and I still feel a huge twinge of guilt every time I think about those little heart-shaped cutouts. They never gave me grief for it, but it was a Polaroid from the 80s so there's no way to get an original copy.",

Treat Williams was shooting the film \"1941\" on a nearby set, directed by Steven Spielberg, and decided to visit the set of The Empire Strikes Back during his off-time.",

            "comment": "I really enjoyed Treat as an actor, grew up watching him in movies and tv shows.  One of my favorite memories is watching him in the movie Deep Rising with my mom.  When I was younger, me and my mom use to have movie nights.  Mom had a big flatscreen tv and a king size bed in her room.  We\u2019d get a big bowl of popcorn to share, prop ourselves up against some fluffy pillows on her bed and watch movies together and Deep Rising was one of her favorites.  She loved the action, comedy and horror aspects of the movie and she thought Treat was very handsome.  When the crew was trapped on the ship and trying to escape the monsters, mom was clapping and yelling at the tv \u201cGO GO GO GO!!!\u201d lol.  Watching him and enjoying that movie together is a fond memory.  I was very sad to hear how he died.  I hope he went quick and didn\u2019t suffer.  RIP Treat.",

            "comment": "Having been brought into Hollywood as a teenager, Leslie became fed up with being forced to take on more roles where her characters acted immature or child-like, even as an adult. Furthermore, as a devout Catholic, she had growing discomfort and irritation about being presented in ways that went against her moral convictions. In the end, she would sue Warner Bros similar to Olivia De Havilland to get out of her contract (the head of the studio out of revenge tried to sabotage her career opportunities going forward), and became a freelance actress until she retired in the late 1950s to take care of her children (She was also happily married for nearly 50 years). Despite angering a number of leaders in Hollywood, Joan Leslie was praised by many in the public and some even portrayed her as a moral heroine. By this courageous stand, she likely avoided the fate of Marilyn Monroe and countless others.",

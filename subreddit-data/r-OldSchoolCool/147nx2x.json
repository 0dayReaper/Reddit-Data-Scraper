It's kind of a weird mix between a romantic road comedy and a serious examination of PTSD, but Henry Winkler and Sally Field have the charm to pull it off. It's Harrison Ford's first movie released after Star Wars (though it was filmed before May, obviously) so it's interesting to see him after he's a superstar but before he knows he's a superstar. Also, the Camaro his character drives is absolutely sick.",

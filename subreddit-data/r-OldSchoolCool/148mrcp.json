Ramune came out in 1884 a lot earlier so it's not like they didn't know soda drinks before, but cola isn't that big in Japan as a whole today anyway, not compared to the US. Soda as a whole isn't as big, and too much competition in the soda market from fruit tasting carbonated drinks like lemon or melon flavour which are very popular.",

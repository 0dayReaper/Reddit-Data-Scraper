Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld et al wilfully and knowingly fabricated the basis for the invasion of Iraq and wilfully and knowingly lied to the U.S. public to justify its actions. The U.S. refused to become a party to the International Criminal Court expressly because Bush Administration officials would be indicted on War Crimes committed during the Iraq War.",

He could have chosen to give his people more freedom. Sadam certainly could have chosen not to murder 300,000 or more of his own populace. And finally, Sadam could have chosen not to make sly moves that led several intelligence services world wide to believe he was reconstituting a WMD program.\n\nThe bustering socialpathic dictator did NONE of these things, and brought destruction down upon his own country and people.  Remember, Sadam could have sued for peace. Instead his sons looted the treasury while Saddam went to hide in a hole like a coward.",

I had a \u201874 I sold a few years ago. The \u201874 model year cars had to have the updated crash protection which included the \u201c5mph bumper\u201d and the Endura front bumper on the \u201873 wouldn\u2019t pass the test. \u201873 only required a \u201c3mph\u201d bumper and that\u2019s putting it in a nut shell. Bumper standards at the time were odd and in some cases the factory was trying to get ahead of the game. It\u2019s safe to say the change was made because of upgrades in the crash protection. Technically there is no such thing as a big block Pontiac because they used the same block, just changing the bore spacing and the way the cooling water ran through the block over the years. The heads off the 455 will bolt onto the original 265. They won\u2019t work but they will bolt on. The engine options for \u201873 were base 455 and the SD455 if I remember correctly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1dllj19w55b1.jpeg?width=1440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f52b0608bc688734a5519c5fedb38cc779fba92\n\n(1974 Trans Am in photo)",

The base block accommodated up to 455cid in stock form. People bored and stroked them farther then that. Pontiac only had one block design. They did have high and low deck blocks but that was deck hight and not a different design. When referring to \u201csmall block\u201d and \u201cbig block\u201d that is two different block designs. For example: a small block Ford is a completely different block than a big block Ford. I\u2019ll use the \u201cWindsor family\u201d (Ford never officially called them a \u201cWindsor\u201d but most car enthusiasts do) of block vs the Ford-Edsel (FE) family of blocks for this. The Windsor a much smaller block in physical dimensions than a FE and they look completely different. Same with the small block Chevy vs the big block Chevy and the same with the small block Dodge vs the big block Dodge. The Pontiac is the same block. In a nut shell they just kept boring and stroking the original 265 until it hit 455. So really they are all just Pontiac blocks with no big or small difference because the parent design is the same. It was an evolution. There was no fixed rule about what a big and a small block was it just so happened the manufacturers made car engines and truck engines and what the basis for the small block was for is a car or a light duty truck and the big block was usually designed as a truck engine. Back then gasoline, over the road trucks hauling freight and used on the farm were more common. A diesel engine is expensive to manufacture. That obviously doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t get used in cars but normally they made a low deck version of the truck engine for big land barges like luxury cars and station wagons and tall deck blocks for trucks. It was a cost savings and a weight savings. If you didn\u2019t need that big beefy block because the load carried by a passenger car wasn\u2019t nearly what a grain truck would need then why put that giant, heavy duty block in there at least cut the deck down or put a smaller engine in it completely. Pontiac didn\u2019t build trucks (since the \u201820\u2019s anyway) so they didn\u2019t design a truck engine specifically although GMC did use Pontiac engines for awhile in the \u201850\u2019s. That\u2019s a general rule of thumb picture of why there were big and small blocks. Later as the horsepower race began in the late \u201850\u2019s they would start putting those truck blocks in passenger cars because they would take the abuse of racing. They needed the larger cubic inch displacement to build horsepower and reduce the load on the internal parts so the engine would last. That is why Ford stuck their \u201ctruck engine\u201d in the GT40 to win at Le Mans. They knew the stresses on the block would be far less than the lighter car engine (small block). It was a much heavier power plant but the cost in weight was offset by the reliability and horsepower. I\u2019m being very broad brush but that\u2019s the just of it. A big block (generally more expensive to build) was generally designed for trucks and is heavy and a small block (generally less expensive to build and lighter weight) was generally a light truck and midsize and smaller passenger car engine. The first car to fit into the class eventually called \u201cmuscle car\u201d was the 1964 Pontiac GTO. The reason most call it the first is because before that the manufacturers were stuffing the big cubic inch, high horsepower \u201cbig blocks\u201d (I will use \u201cbig block\u201d now to mean anything above, approximately 400 cid) in the big cars. John DeLorean caught onto the idea of stuffings mild large luxury passenger car engine into a mid size family car. He realized people wanted a bunch of horsepower but they didn\u2019t want all the trouble of a solid lifter cam and all the other stuff that went on with having a high revving, strung out race engine in a car that you wanted to drive every day. The GTO was the first mass produced (key thing is it was MASS PRODUCED) midsize passenger car with a full-size car engine. It had a mild engine that produced a horsepower to weight ratio that gave nearly the same performance from a mid size car as the big, strung out SD421 did in the full-size Catalina. The rest is history. The next big event was the Pony Car which the first was the Mustang and then a year later the competition from the other manufacturers because they absolutely had to build something similar because (I think to this day) the Mustang was the largest first year sales car in the history of the automobile. Thus the Camaro, Firebird, Cougar, and later (Chrysler and AMC didn\u2019t have the money to make a true Pony Car until the \u201868 AMC Javelin and the \u201870 Barracuda and Challenger,  model year) Barracuda, Challenger. Note: A true Pony car is the layout of the original Mustang, long hood/short deck and that\u2019s why the Barracuda can\u2019t actually be called a Pony car until the \u201870 model year and the same for anything AMC made. Neither truly had a chassis layout that was like the Mustang until the late \u201860\u2019s/early \u201870\u2019s.",

It is both a federal law enforcement organization, and a part of the armed forces.     \n\nIt comes under the jurisdiction of Department of Homeland Security, and is not part of the Department of Defense like the other military branches.\n\nDuring times of national conflict, it is attached to the Navy.  It performs many of the same functions abroad, as they do at home, with many more added.  While it's much smaller than the Navy, (only the Space Force is smaller,) compared to the rest of the world, it would still rank as the 12th largest naval force in the world.",

He's from coastal Maryland and is good with small boats, so he figured he could dodge Nam, post up in Key West for a year or so, and come out with some money for college. Slight problem: the Coast Guard did indeed go to Vietnam and, since it was smaller than the Navy, you actually had a better (worse?) chance of getting deployed. \n\nHis first orders were to Vietnam. He said he was swearing up and down for about 10 minutes continuously before he just burst out laughing.",

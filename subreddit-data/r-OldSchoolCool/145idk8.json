Maybe we lived in different regions or something, but I don't know anybody who gave a crap about smelly curtains or brown ceilings. \n\nGovernment hospitals? Do you mean, like, on an army base? I was also in quite a few hospitals back then and smoked in every single one... in the hallway, in the lobby, and in the patient's room. The only place we DIDN'T smoke was on elevators.\n\nI'm not tryna be an asshole, I'm genuinely curious how we can have two completely different recollections of smoking in 1984!\n\n#edit\n####(op blocked me)\n\nI see you are not the type who can gracefully handle being bested. You made a bunch of rude and defensive remarks and then blocked me so I couldn't respond. Indeed, the actions of a coward.\n\nYou should have figured out by now from the comments that most people thought you were speaking of the US, and hence your title is inaccurate. That's why I, and other people, reacted the way we did. You didn't have to take such a defensive stance. Everybody makes mistakes.\n\nTo address the comments you tried to block me from addressing:\n\n&gt;you cited sources that don't exist\n\nFalse. I cited Reddit.com. The figures I quoted are published and accurate *You* are the one who didn't cite a source.\n\n&gt;accused me of lying about life in a country you've never been to\n\nFalse. (a) I didn't previously accuse you of lying, and (b) how do you know what countries I've been to? There you go again, spewing assumptions.\n\n&gt;you got embarrassed\n\nBa-hahaha! You're the one making a fool of yourself. \n\n&gt;It's obvious you're a new user\n\nAww, you figured out my account age all by yourself? You looked at my profile and think that tells you something? I'd say the same to you\u2014that you'll figure things out around here eventually\u2014but I doubt it. You're too dim.\n\nYou are a child. Maybe put more thought into your post next time? Or at least face the people you accuse instead of hiding behind the block feature.\n\nAt this point, I can only conclude that mental health issues are involved. Sea kelp.",

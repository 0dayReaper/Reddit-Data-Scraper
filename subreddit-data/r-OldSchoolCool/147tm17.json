You get a bad feeling something is  wrong, shaking yourself back awake you stumble to your window. The entire street is flooded, your business is ruined. Your rush downstairs and hop into your car. If you are quick enough you can drive it to higher land before the engine floods and it never runs again. As you pull away you see something in your rear view mirror. Two Americans giggle and splash in the water while hooding the bumper of your vehicle.",

For those interested in this kind of thing look for a book titled, \u201cSo-Cal Speed Shop: The Fast Tale of the California Racers Who Made Hot Rod History\u201d and a NEAT movie called \u201cThe Hot Rod Story\u201d. Both the book and the movie involve Alex Xydias who was the founder of So-Cal Speed Shop.",

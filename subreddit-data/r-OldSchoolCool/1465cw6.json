They were together for only about six months. In her biography she evidently dated several famous musicians in the early seventies. She married once, had a boy with another man she dated then was in a long term relationship with painter Maria Desiderio until her death at 49.",

I read her biography yesterday and listened to her album Eli and The Thirteenth Confession and she was even more complex than her music in real life. Part of it is that she was not comfortable being a \"Celebrity\" and was a private person. David Letterman begged her to come on his show as did Saturday Night Live as musical guests in the nineties. She loved living in the country in peace and only her closest friends knew she was Bisexual and most people didn't know she was in a relationship with a famous woman painter Maria Desiderio for over a decade when she died at 49. She also was not marketed to emphasize that she was first a singer then a songwriter.",

Lots of professional athletes participate in \"alternative\" means of exercise to strengthen parts of their bodies that their traditional workouts don't hit. You rarely hear of it, though, and I think it leads younger folks to see those activities as \"gay\" or somehow \"less than.\"",

When I was young in the 80s and 90s you would get made fun of for doing something like taking ballet as a boy.  I've seen lots of musicals and I always loved music and dancing.  I'm also not opposed to drag.  I just don't always like the various groups out there like LTBTQ+.  I feel like their agendas go overboard and are often more about power than making things better for gay people.",

Just a woman who was institutionalized and then used as propaganda by the oppressive Soviet machine. \n \nFuck the Soviet government, fuck the Russian government.     \n\nShe may have been smart, skilled, capable, and pleasant to be around.     \nThat does not make her Cool in any way.    \nNot her fault, but she was born into a society that deserved no Coolness awards.",

I usually use it as an example of acid/base and chemical reactions.\n\nThe kids usually laugh and laugh.  Then I point out they use scissors on their jeans and get the same effect.\n\nEdit:\n\nI did other stupid stuff as well.  When I was around 10, I got a chemistry set.  One of the coolest chemicals was phenolphthalein, which is a chemical that turns pink in the presence of a base.\n\nSo I loved testing random liquids.  I tested my 16-year-old brother's orange juice without him knowing.  Nope.  Contains citric acid.  Not a base.  Didn't change color.\n\nBro drank it.  Well, the problem is phenolphthalein is also a strong laxative.  It was sold as such until it was also found to be a carcinogen.  \n\nHe got the shits.  Bad.  At school. Like \"Mom come pick me up and bring pants\" bad.\n\nFortunately, it was never traced back to me.  It was 45 years ago, so I don't think I gave him cancer.",

Her (teenaged) father sitting on the hood of a trans-am showing off his bleached blonde rat-tail and flipping off the camera in an Iron Maiden Shirt.   \n\n\nPicture 2 : ( Which she shared to snapchat)   \n\n\nHer dad age 17, with his curly , hair-sprayed mullet and dangling cross earring, smoking a cig and looking very -very stoned.   \n\n\nMy brother did not appreciate it.",

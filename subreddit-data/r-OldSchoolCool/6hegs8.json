Really try to stick to only one large open world game at a time, be it RPG, or otherwise. I find that when I don't follow this, I get bogged down with both and make minimal progress which then leads to me focusing on one anyway but then by the time I finish that one, hopping into the second game feels weird since I was in the middle of the story and the flow suddenly feels wonky. But that's just me. If you don't have that issue, then FO4 is a fine game. Just don't expect anything as deep as Witcher. If you want something more comparable, I'd suggest Fallout New Vegas.",

Fallout 4 is a good game, it's just the RPG/story/side missions aren't as good/as deep as previous games, but the action is much better. Witcher 3 pretty much blows it out of the water as far as how incredibly deep it is, but again, Fallout 4 is fun and as long as you go in not expecting something as good as Witcher 3 its worth playing, imo.",

Management of nearly one-third of the rubble from the World Trade Centers occurred \"Between September 12, 2001 and July 31, 2002, [when] debris was transported by trucks to loading piers and then by barges to the WTC Recovery Operation at Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, NY (hereafter referred to as the Landfill). Sifting and sorting operations at the Landfill yielded 4,257 human remains, 54,000 personal items, and pieces of material evidence from the terrorist attack\" (Ekenga, Scheu, Cone, Stellman, &amp; Farfel, 2011, p. 1). This case and the general situation of Fresh Kills is a case study in some public relations courses regarding the dissemination of information surrounding crises and disasters and ensuring appropriate plans are in place to communicate to the general public when information may be more damaging than remaining silent (see: due to the name of the landfill).\n\nSource:\nEkenga, C.

I was a senior in high school the next year when the attack happened.\n\nGoing to the site was an intense experience because, as I grew up on the other side of the country, actually being there sort of made the whole thing \"real.\" I remember being extremely pissed off on the day it happened and scared in a way, but never cried that day. When I went to the memorial and through the museum I broke down multiple times.\n\nIt was just such a pivotal moment in world history, one of those benchmarks where you can clearly divide what the world was like before and after it. I think every American should find a way to get there.",

My great uncle was a retired VP who served on the board at a Wall Street firm and when he would come in for meetings he would always take me to Windows on the World atop the North Tower for 'millionaire burgers and beer'. I used those towers as my navigation tool to get around the city...just walk toward them and I am home. I left NYC right before 9/11 and haven't been back. I don't know what a raw sobbing nerve I will be if I'm tearing up just thinking about out it right now. ",

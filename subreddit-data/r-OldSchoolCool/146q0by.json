She recorded \u201cAs Tears Go By,\u201d as a single in 1964, and it reached UK #9, US #22. The following year, the Rolling Stones released their own version, hitting US #6. \n\nMarianne reportedly met Mick Jagger when she was 17, and started dating around this time. They shared a rocky relationship and split in 1970, after her suicide attempt while Mick filmed \u201cNed Kelly,\u201d in Australia.",

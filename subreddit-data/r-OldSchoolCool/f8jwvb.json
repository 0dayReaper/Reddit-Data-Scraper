Popeye proceeded to steal Hamgravy's girl and his comic. Of course as soon as Olive left Hamgravy for Popeye she then started flirting with the newly introduced Bluto.\n\nThe strip was started by E.C. Segar as The Thimble Theatre in 1919 starring Olive Oyl, Harold Hamgravy,  and Olive's brother Castor Oil who were actors that acted our various scenarios. Eventually it turned into an adventure comic and then in 1931 Popeye took over as the main character, 12 years after the comic started.",

He, along with Olive \u2018s old boyfriend, Harold \u2018Ham\u2019 Gravy were the stars of the Thimble Theatre comic strip. \n\nEventually, during a storyline involving travel to a gambling island, Castor hired a sailor to run his ship.\n\nEnter Popeye \n\nAfter that adventure, Popeye made infrequent appearances in the strip before finally replacing Ham Gravy as Olive\u2019s boyfriend and then Castor as the strip\u2019s focus.\n\nOnce he became popular enough, Popeye was licensed for a series of theatrical cartoons produced by the Fleischer Brothers studios. Not really designed to support the strip\u2019s complex story arcs, they utilized the now well known formula of Popeye using spinach to solve his issues. Bluto, who only appeared in the original strip once, was chosen as the main antagonist.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is the actual story.",

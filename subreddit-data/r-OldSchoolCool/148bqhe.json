It made peak power at 1800 rpm.",

An interesting detail is that the headlights were detachable and were tucked away in the trunk of the car as M. Esders would not drive during the night hours and thought that the headlights ruined the shape of the body. This body was stripped from the chassis in 1935. The french coach builder Henri Binder built another body - the *Coupe de Ville* - fir this chassis. This second body was quite similar to the Bugatti *Coupe Napoleon* that was designed by Jean Bugatti in 1931 and had the chassis no. 41-100.",

Typically (from my limited experience), they're not really built to last, due to the overall lack of necessity for extreme longevity. Because after filming, the fuck are you going to do with a several ton robot, right? To save on costs and time, we usually just stuffed it full with some fire retardant foam, made sure the skeleton and animatronics were accessible and I was told everything is usually torn apart, after everything.",

And yet it's fully under control - they have it swinging all over the place with the crew standing around, dipping and diving, picking things up, and yet nobody's at risk. That's some amazing precision.\n\nI cannot imagine how much work went into it. No wonder the movie still looks epic - they got the effects right before the cameras were even rolling.",

Avatar 2 is CGI that was baked for like 10 years, but most computer effects studios are rushed to hell. Marvel is very guilty of doing that, for instance. \n\nBack in the day, the limitations forced creativity and effort for anything to look even remotely believable. It's a lot easier to make a decent looking movie cheaply these days, but you very rarely see a big budget blockbuster take advantage of it's special effects budget like something like Jurassic Park did. \n\nAnimatronics can look amazing when done well, but they're almost never used these days. Why bother, when you can make a CGI model move fluidly so much more easily? A tangibility is definitely lost in most blockbusters though, your mind can definitely tell when most of what's on screen is a computer model. Even Jurassic Park 3, while a pretty mediocre movie overall, had vastly more immersive special effects than any of the Jurassic World films did. It's not even close imo. \n\nDenis Villeneuve and James Cameron are the main directors still taking their time and making very immersive special effects. Ultimately, audiences don't really seem to care about subpar CGI, so most filmmakers just won't even bother trying anymore.",

The tension is so palpable in that scene because there isn't some bombastic score pushing it forward. It's all in the acting and Spielberg's direction, along with John Williams knowing when to and when not to add background music. Of course the musical score for the movie is just one of the best of all time, but that scene works perfectly without any music.",

It just takes a lot of money, and sane executives, and those don't reliably overlap. \n\nHow it should be is: ask the effects guys what you can get away with. James Cameron is a celebrated director largely because he was originally an effects dork. He fooled audiences professionally. So he understood that the most powerful technology for that is... a jump cut. \n\nDoing two clever things in the same shot is obscenely difficult. \n\nDoing one clever thing each in two shots is dead easy. \n\nContemporary example: rescuing Sarah Connor from the mental ward. There's a shot where the checkerboard floor gloops up into a dude, and that was achieved with cutting-edge rendering. That's not it. There's a shot where that gloop-dude sluices through some jail bars, and that was achieved with hand-painted computer animation. That's not it. Immediately after, gloopy's gun catches on the bars, and that's almost it. But shortly - gloopster forces open an elevator door, finding a shotgun staring him in the face, and the gun splits his liquid-metal head into silly putty. \n\nThe question is, how did they animate Robert Patrick's actual head exploding into a practical prop? And the answer is, they didn't.",

They are the first movies I've fallen asleep watching since I was a kid. I even fell asleep in the theater during the first Avengers movie, which was embarrassing.\n\nIt's like all I see is a few actors surrounding by popping colors and shiny fake stuff. Then most of the dialogue is witty banter and cliches. I wish I liked them as much as everyone else.",

You're likely familiar with the Volume sets they use on Mandalorian-  projected UE5 environments so the shot is all in-camera and the actor gets properly lit and can see their location. The era of everything just being blank and green is waning and has been over for several years now. Sure some people will still do stuff like that, but it's not necessarily advantageous for VFX now, it can fuck up your lighting because of the green bounce onto actors, and in general the industry has moved beyond this. \n\n\nNot that it was ever a big deal anyway. Acting has always been more about theater of the imagination than theater of illusion. One of Ian Mckellen's most lauded performances is a Macbeth with no set, in a black box, with minimal all black costumes. He couldn't see the fucking forest of Dunsinane or anything, but he still had to act. 99% of actors will never work in an environment where props are realistic and plentiful, costumes and sets are accurate, etc. The unusual situation is the one where you're shooting or performing in an actual location with all of the real things. The typical situation relies on imagination.\n\nBack to McKellen again- one of the main anecdotes feeding this narrative that green screen kills creativity is the story of McKellen breaking down on The Hobbit on a green screen set and saying something like \"this isn't why I got into acting.\" People tell that story to explain why those movies are bad and attribute that to the overuse of green screen and stitched together interactions because nothing was shot with the actors actually together, but what people leave out is the detail that it was hour whatever on set and people were arguing and had seemed to forget about Sir Ian, who was just lonely in a green room. The guy who played Magneto a million times is not lamenting working on green screen in that story. He may very well be including not working face to face with other actors in his lament but that story always seemed to me to be more about set disharmony than about green screen=bad. \n\n\nBroadly speaking working on green screen is no different to anything else, it's all still pretend, and there are plenty of creative processes involving green screen that are so successful the audience never realizes it happened.",

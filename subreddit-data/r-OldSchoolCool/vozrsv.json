You can\u2019t just say oh there\u2019s like 10-15 in each park.\n\nIf an adult is like \u201ccome on tell me\u201d you\u2019d say \u201cthere\u2019s only one but he\u2019s really fast, so he can make all the parades and say hi to every guest\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve had guests get frustrated because I just wouldn\u2019t break character and it got to almost be this messed up way of messing with them lol. But yeah, they really instilled in every worker no matter how old you do not ever ever ever give away a secret, ruin the magic, or expose the reality , the kids and parents will only ever get one answer and that is Mickey is just the G, he moves at the speed of light and knows every inch of the park to get everywhere be everywhere so quickly.",

And then when revisiting The Muppet Movie (the \u201879 original) in 2010-ish it was still hilarious. In fact it brought to light how they always incorporated more adult-geared humor as well. This video with Dreyfuss seems almost on-point for muppets even with the blooper lol. The \u201879 movie\u2019s very Mel-Brooks-ish in humor, with a lot of hippiedom mixed in (chase the rainbow message, Electric Mayhem band and their multicolored studebaker, Hare Krishna references\u2026), and cameos like Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Bob Hope, Orson Welles, legendary stuff. As a tot I also used to love the Muppet Babies cartoon that finished in \u201891.\n\nEdit: Clarification \u2014 I was born in \u201885, so I didn\u2019t watch Sesame Street in \u201869, but 1990. Just wanted to put a disclaimer that I\u2019m not a boomer.",

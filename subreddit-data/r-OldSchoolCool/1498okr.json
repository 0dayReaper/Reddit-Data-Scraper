That was like beating the game.  Atari was first console again at friends home and I remember playing frog game where you catch flies. \n\nTMNT 2 was a huge hit among friends. It was easier for our age. \n\n\nBut today,\nTMNT 1 is probably one of my favorite  nes games. Way ahead of its time with character switch and their weapons being more useful for different enemies. When you actually know how to play it. Its easily in my Top 5 \n\nWhat was your favorites?",

Had them all summer to play, told him to go with NES\u2026 and he went with Sega because they offered more advertising co-op. \n\nLost out big that Xmas.",

It is incredible, especially the acting (especially John Lithgow as Churchill, and Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, but I can't think of one mediocre or poor performance and most of the cast have their great moments) and the directing. It can be a little slow in parts but when it's good, it is *really* good (the best ones imo are the ones with the Margaret-Townsend scandal, the coronation and the Churchill portrait).\n",

They're neutered politically, ensuring our democracy, yet act as a kind of living, breathing institutional avatar for our country's heritage.

There'd be a void in society, and I personally think our Prime Minister, who essentially is supposed to just be a politician and not some kind of symbol, would be compelled to start behaving more like a President does or a celebrity (aka a symbol of power) in order to compensate. A lot of people would prefer those two roles remain separate. ",

Taking the step of constitutional cosmetic surgery would perhaps, at least ostensibly, make us more socially equitable, if not symbolically, but in real terms, abolision would not suddenly pull people out of poverty; that's up to our government. The budget is what it is, and if nothing else, the monarchy bring money into the country, not drain it. \n\nBut really, it's a question of identity. After all, what would our artists and writers have to kick back against without classism: the ultimate British muse? ",

Then there are spouse queens, which are married to kings and hold no power on their own. When their husbands die, they become queen dowagers. Rarely there may be more than one queen dowager alive and younger one could take title of queen mother for easier distinction between them. For example for short period of time between 1952 and 1953 there were three British queens: reigning queen Elizabeth, queen mother Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon and queen dowager Mary of Teck.",

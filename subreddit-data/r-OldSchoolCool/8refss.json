I was looking at this photo and thinking about how worried he was about the drought and how happy he was about the rain, how important all of this was to him, and now he\u2019s gone forever, everything that seemed important to him has disappeared in time and none of that really mattered. All that is left of him is this photograph that captured his moment of happiness that strangers are looking at decades after his death before moving on with their lives and forgetting about it almost instantly.\n\nFuck me, why do you have to do this to me Reddit?",

When I visit my mom's house, a lot of things are the same as when I lived at home with her except things are different now. So much has happened in all those years but in a way it still feels the same. The only difference is just time - something that we can measure but still don't quite understand.\n\nAnyway, am I high now? I feel high.",

When an account has been given gold, they get some extra perks that other non-gilded accounts don\u2019t get (not sure exactly all of the perks but IIRC there\u2019s being able to subscribe to /r/lounge, highlighting new comments, themes I think - I\u2019m not sure, I bet you can find a list somewhere or someone else can provide a better list). As well as providing the account with the gold perks, the money you pay to give gold goes to paying for Reddit\u2019s servers. I don\u2019t remember the numbers but each gilding pays for some amount of hours of server-time. So basically it\u2019s supporting the website that many of us use so often. ",

Without rain, pastures are no longer able to support their local ecosystems, and predators become desperate. The long walk to school became dangerous, and it was rumored that coyotes had even resorted to attacking children. I always passed through a ravine that ran through our neighbors property on my way to school, and on this day in particular, my luck had run out. The only thing that saved me was my trusty hammer that I brought for shop class. When I was a little more than halfway across the ravine, I saw the first one. A mangy, but desperate, coyote at the end of the trail. I started backing away slowly, but it was too late. He started calling them in. I took off my back pack, pulled out my hammer, and grabbed the bag's straps so I could use it as a shield. The first coyote came from my left, but God was I fast back then. I brought my hammer down on his head as he leaped at me. The beast probably died instantly. The next two came at me together. One charged in and got a literal textbook shield bash to the face, but the second took a good hard bite into my thigh. Repeated hammer blows crushed ribs and broke a malicious spirit, and the bite was released. By this time my power combos were charged up and I was able to one hit the other coyote. Three more crazed beasts entered the fray but they were no match for my back, back, forward charge attack. When I finally made it to school I had earned so much xp that I leveled up. ",

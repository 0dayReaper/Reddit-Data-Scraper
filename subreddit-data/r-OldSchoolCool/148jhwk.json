In this photo, Lady Bird Johnson was visiting Vietnam at the time, and this was a celebration of the opening of a new highway between the cities of Saigon and Dalat, its construction being sponsored by the American government.\n\nMy grandmother has been to most countries in Western Europe, East Asia, many states in North America, Canada, etc... because it was rare to have someone speak Vietnamese, English, and French fluently. She is especially proud of this because at the time, young Vietnamese women were expected to stay home. But her parents encouraged her to explore the world! She is 93 now, still very sharp. She likes to spend her time on her ipad watching youtube and sending emails to old friends.",

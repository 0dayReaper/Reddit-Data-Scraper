    "postText": "Inherited old newspapers\n\nMy great uncle passed away a few years ago and I was recently talking to his wife and somehow got on the subject of JFK. She told me that my uncle had a tote full of old papers and that if I wanted them I could have them. I was going through them a couple nights ago and these are a couple cool things I found. The 3rd is a paper from April 8, 1945. Hitler would die 22 days later. The JFK paper is in pretty much perfect condition. \n\nAlong with these, I found the news paper from the day after 9/11, a set of papers from the whole month from the OKC bombing in 1995, and some really old papers from 1942 in good condition.\nIt was amazing reading some of the articles in those papers. Most of the papers are from the mid 60\u2019s - 90\u2019s the newest being the one from 9/11",

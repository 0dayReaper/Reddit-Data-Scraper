            "comment": "Linda was photographed by noted photographer Ethan Russell, who stated that the horse happened to ride by, as they were walking behind Linda\u2019s house in Malibu, waiting for a nice shot. Others exist from this photo session, but this one was unexpected. Linda reportedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot, you might scare the horse.\u201d \n\nThis was the cover of \u201cHasten Down The Wind, \u201c Linda\u2019s July 1976 release, which reached #3 in the US, reaching Platinum status, and #32 UK, with Silver status. It was her third successful LP in a row. \n\nEthan Russell was the photographer who shot the \u201cLet It Be\u201c and \u201cHey Jude\u201d covers for the Beatles, and is featured in the film, as well as Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cGet Back\u201c documentary series. He also famously worked with The Rolling Stones, from 1968-72, as their official tour photographer. He shot the filming of The Stones\u2019 \u201cRock and Roll Circus.\u201d  Among his other work from the era are The Who\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Next,\u201d the Grammy-nominated work on the \u201cQuadrophenia\u201d release, and \u201cWho\u2019s Better, Who\u2019s Best.\u201d He later worked as a film director.",

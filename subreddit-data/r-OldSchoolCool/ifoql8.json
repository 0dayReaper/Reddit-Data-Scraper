They\u2019ve now made it a central part of their identity, at the forefront of their every day actions.\n\nYou don\u2019t think there has been a notable uptick over the past few years in the amount of *openly* racist viewpoints being shared on social media, in public spaces, in media, in government speeches, et cetera?\n\nIf your personal journey has been different, that\u2019s fine and it\u2019s of course valid, but my own experience and the experience of those around me has been: People we knew who had more secretive racial biases they only brought up in limited company and were mostly limited to committing micro-aggressions in the past... have found some new passion to be completely open in those beliefs, posting about them on social media, confronting people in the streets, et cetera.  Because they feel validated and accepted in those beliefs at a higher level.\n\nPeople who a few years ago would have grumbled some racist remarks under their breath at the sight of a BLM shirt now run right up to the person and start screaming about \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d, alleged black crime statistics, why BLM are terrorists, et cetera.  To quote one of the white dudes in the truck that pulled up next to my friend \u201cTrump\u2019s in the White House now, your time is up and your days are numbered.\u201d\n\nTL,DR:  There have always been openly, proudly, racist people in the United States.  There are also many many people who aren\u2019t so open about it, who attempt (in vain) to hide their racism and dance around the real reasons for their racist actions and beliefs with absurd excuses.  More and more of the latter are joining the former, no longer feeling the need to hide their bigotry because they feel it\u2019s more socially acceptable now.",

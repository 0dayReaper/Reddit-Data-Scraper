She performed a lot with musicians like Stanley Clark and Omar Hakim.\n\nI first got to know him through my father, who loved jazz very much. It was a long time ago, when I was a kid.

Both my parents have great taste in music and i always remember waking up on winter days to get ready for  kindergarden while my dad was playing his musical playlist loudly. Since then I have listened to a wide range of genres and I feel like it was passed down to me from my parents.",

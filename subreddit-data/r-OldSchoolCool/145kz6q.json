The photographer here was the notable Terry O\u2019Neill, (1938-2019) known for his extensive career over decades. \n\nWhile this photo is interesting, other photos, including one Terry preferred, featured Stevie captured without his glasses. In one shot, Stevie is shown climbing atop a playground jungle gym. In another shot, Stevie smiles as he is shown (with the same boy shown here), their hands to each other\u2019s face.",

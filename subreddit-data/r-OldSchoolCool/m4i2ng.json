She was doing a show in NY and one of her friends was going to meet him at his house out of the city, and wanted to know if Nan wanted to come along too.\n\nSo they spent a lovely afternoon in upstate NY with him. She asked him to sketch his theory of relativity on a cocktail napkin, which he did for her... sadly she did not keep it, and I heard her many times over the years express regret for that.",

Pictured with him is your grandma.\n\nAnd I can talk to you.\n\nAll these decades later.\n\nHowever brief and fleeting this interaction may be, it still blows my mind that it is possible and said interaction can happen while I casually browse reddit.\n\nThank you for sharing your grandma's story. Really moving.\n\nIn the Wiki article, she is quoted as saying, \"It was a revelation to me. All these years I had thought I was stupid, but in reality I just had a hearing problem.\"\n\nDespite the decades that separate us, I have felt the same way about my life. Just, in my case it was mental illness.\n\nOP, may you have a wonderful and safe week.\n\nYou are awesome for sharing with us a little slice of your own human journey and where you come from.\n\nEdit: Damn, that incident that nearly killed her in 1955. That hits home. Had a family member at the moment of the 2020 Beirut Port Explosion end up with quite a few injuries, but would have been absolutely fatal had they not been slightly turned. Shards of glass just flew by and around them, but if they had been just a few centimeters to one side or another, the injuries would have been so much worse. Your grandma really lived an interesting, and challenging, life it seems!",

She was doing a show in NY and one of her friends was going to meet him at his house out of the city, and wanted to know if Nan wanted to come along too.\n\nSo they spent a lovely afternoon in upstate NY with him. She asked him to sketch his theory of relativity on a cocktail napkin, which he did for her... sadly she did not keep it, and I heard her many times over the years express regret for that.",

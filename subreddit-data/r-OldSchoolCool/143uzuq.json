They mostly lived in hotels because Mabel didn\u2019t like to keep house. Yes, I did a deep dive on the IMDb trivia page, because I was sure she was going to call a divorce lawyer with that look on her face \ud83e\udd23 (edited cuz now I see Phyllis was identified in the title)",

Very interesting person. Evidently he was a heck of a nice guy too. Curly unfortunately had a series of strokes and moe alway looked after him. They were a close family. Even though they weren\u2019t related to Larry they were very close friends.",

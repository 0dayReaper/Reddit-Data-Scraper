Like how war has affected our view to resources and cultural activities, for example, rationing of food items had lead to innovation and development of alternative recipes for various food items which as somehow changed how we view it as individuals. \n\nHunting and standing in a way of posing over the animal the person had hunted was a change which lead to such behaviour and lead to people trying new things, even though they might have the original idea, they change it to work in the circumstance and accordingly a newer idea, a newer version of something old is adapted, a way is passed on for generations, evolved over the events of distress and happiness in the lives of the man.",

Just love how the chair back design mimics the openings in that collar. \n\nIf you have more family fotos, look to see where else that white collar appears. It\u2019s detachable and would have stayed as part of the wardrobe for the girls in the family for years.",

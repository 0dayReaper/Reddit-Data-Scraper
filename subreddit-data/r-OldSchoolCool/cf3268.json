We'll, since a LARGE portion of the US is rural and it simply isn't cost effective to build it in 85%(?) of the country, we drive. I now drive 19 miles to work. It used to be 106 miles. In a Silverado. The closest store is 9 miles away. The closest restaurant is 13 miles. To us in rural Georgia, that is close. Where I used to live in Pennsylvania, that was outrageous. My commute to work there was 13 miles and I thought it was long.\nI also remember the spike in prices during the Gulf War. It was at $1.29/gal and as a college student, I was freaking out. Now, I'd LOVE those prices.",

I had posters of all the yearly Hot Wheels releases on my walls, I had my TV set to SPEED Channel 24/7.  I could walk into any store and find some kind of NASCAR merchandise.  My favorite place in the summer was the local dirt race track, even just hanging out in the stands felt like my home away from home.  \n\nNow I'm in my early 20's.  The race track is closed down.  SPEED Channel is now FOX Sports 1.  Hot Wheels are made of plastic now instead of metal.  There's no way in hell I can afford to do anything I really dreamed of doing to my daily driver, if I'm lucky I can buy a stock car spoiler for it.  The idea of being a race car driver, or even going to school to get a degree in engineering and become a crew chief is long fucking gone.  And to top it all of, we're seriously talking about automating driving.\n\nThe world has absolutely shifted away from car culture, not just in the past 49 years, but the past 20 too.

I hope more people live in dense cities and use transit, walking, and biking to kill the suv and beige car market.

Like why would you want an old car?  \n\nNow that's all I like. My car is older than I am and I love that.  \nThere's an elegance in the simplicity. Anyone with a box of tools and the know how can basically pull it to bits and fix it. Replace or repair parts. You can tell what's wrong by a sound or a feeling. No need for plug in tools to read error codes.  \n\nAnd that's not even that old, go back to when the only electronics were the ignition. Like the cars in the photos. No injectors or computers, just pure mechanical genius.  \n\nSure, there's definitely something to be said for modern cars. Super safe, super efficient. 4L/100km. And yet able to perform when needed. You could never get that without the plethora of sensors and electronics they use.  \n\nI just wish they weren't such a mission to work on, but maybe that's just me needing to get with the times.",

And as my student loans start to roll in this year and the responsibilities start to pile up from getting older. The more and more I realize that finishing the car might take another decade. Or might not even happen at all. I can\u2019t just be irresponsible and put other things off to fund the project. \n\nI still say you should not let go of your car passion.

So I am fortunate enough trade my soul out to racecars.  But it's graphic design, it doesn't pay enough to put the *real* vroom vroom juice in my car.\n\nI've dreamed of owning a BMW era MINI Cooper for the past decade.  But I grew up and learned just how astoundingly expensive the upkeep and maintenance of one of those British-German bastards are.  I can't do it.  It breaks my heart.  There was a MINI that I test drove April 2018 that I wanted, I saw it on a used car lot yesterday.  I knew it had problems when I drove it, but I was talked out of buying it at the time, and it broke my heart to see the new owner was having so much trouble with it that they already traded it in.  \n\nShit's just too expensive now.\n\nI won't walk away from what I love.  But growing up now with the passion that we have, it just doesn't feel fair.  It's hard to imagine a future where motorsports and car culture are more, or even equally popular, as they are now.",

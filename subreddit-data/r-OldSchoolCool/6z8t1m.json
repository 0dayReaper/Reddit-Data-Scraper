These are great acts but they don't really fit with the format of the show.  The singers you just have them do other songs, then throw in some background instruments, up the stage production.  Bring in some celeb to pair them up with.  What are you going to do for table juggling?",

Even talents like dancing or comedy which have a lot of versatility to them isn't something you can easily improve on a week-to-week basis because you're having to develop or refine an entirely new act.  Meanwhile, a singer is usually just picking a song to cover.  It's really not a level playing field.",

They had a bunch of dancing Stormtroopers on who must of the judges were underwhelmed with, but Cowell used his Golden Ticket or whatever to put through. Fair enough, that's his prerogative. There was a bit of a palava about it in the papers though and it was all over the entertainment news for a few days.\n\nThen I thought about it, and realised you can't just dress as stormtroopers for a novelty act. You have to be licensed to do that sort of thing on tv, so there's no way they could have just gone on and done it out of the blue. It bugged me for a bit until I watched another episode and saw what the competition was: an all-expenses paid trip to Disneyworld.\n\nSo basically, one of the show's funders had a licenced act of theirs placed on the show and the head judge gave them a free ride through to the second round. That is genuinely one of the most cynical things I've seen on modern tv.",

Its almost as if they want to place them in a round where they will be certain they'll go through.\n\nIt gets so frustrating too when judges poke criticism on variety acts for being repetitive and becoming boring. Singers only do one thing and almost always get a standing ovation. Sure, they may be great at it, it just seems hypocritical to me.\n\nAlso, America's Got Talent and not a single judge is American...... \n\n/rant",

Trying again.\n\nYes, here's another as a duo:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0d-gTqiI3zc\n\nThey were from France, and also performed as a trio under the name \"Le Trio Baranton\", where they can be seen in this video too:\n\nhttps://www.ina.fr/video/CPF86614421\n\nI've been able to find names for two of them -- Regina and Yvonne. Regina married another foot juggler (also known as an antipodist) by the name of Gil Dova and they [apparently lived in the western USA] (https://www.juggle.org/jugglers-where-are-they-now-volume-3/) as of last year.\n\nThey seem to have been active from the late 50s to the late 60s. I've also found references to another foot juggler by the name of Eliane Baranton, but haven't yet confirmed if she's a daughter of one of the others, or simply took their name.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4s7sOHREex0\n\n(I don't *think* she's the third of the trio, although I found a long-closed ebay auction purporting to be selling a poster from 1970 with that name on it. There are videos of Eliane from the last decade, though, and I can't imagine a foot juggler still being active 40 years later.)",

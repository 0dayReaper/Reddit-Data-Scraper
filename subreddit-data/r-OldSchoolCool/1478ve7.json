I still listen to their music- it\u2019s timeless.\n\nI feel so fortunate to have been raised in an era with the best rock music ever written and played by the most talented musicians \u2014 I can\u2019t think of any modern music or musicians that can even come close to comparing with the great talents of bands like Dire Straits.",

I don\u2019t think there has been someone with such a handle on phrasing (archer jokes aside); almost everything he plays is a melody that stands on its own\u2026That and he can sing at the same time. Brothers in arms is a masterpiece; both the song, or the whole album",

He discovered he had a passion for math and worked throughout school and became an engineer. He went to get his masters and got a job at NASA :) \n\nEdit: My dad wanted to clarify but he said he actually worked at schlumberger and then NASA. So he was at another company for a couple of years and then NASA.. I guess I don't know that much about my dad. Even I didn't know that...",

Hell, when I downsized my office back to a one man shop, I gave my tech his workstation, Acad license, B size laserprinter - and all the non-engineering clients/work we were doing, plus guaranteed him $1000/mo in work. I still use him 30-40 hours a month. I can throw absolute chicken scratch to him and it comes back like a good set of prints.  ",

Autocorrect doesn't have a very large vocabulary compared to, say, a person with a particularly large vocabulary, nor does it account for the various permutations available, like the addition of Greek roots to applicable words or less common conjugations.\n\nIt's fine for pointing out obvious errors that arise from typing on a tiny touch screen, but I ignore it otherwise. Sometimes it's actively harmful and more deserving of the moniker \"autocorrupt.\"\n\nDouble contractions have never been particularly common, and no contraction has ever been considered \"formal,\" but they remain constructable under normal rules and may even be in regular use in certain specific circles , e.g. fo'c'sle.\n\nReally oddball contractions will most often be found in attempts to recreate colloquialisms, which is really what the entire system exists to do, so in that use it can't really be *wrong*, per se.",

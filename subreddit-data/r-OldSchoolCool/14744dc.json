Every time I see SRV I gotta stop and give it a listen and give a hard upvote.      \nYou should check out some of his interviews, he's humble, gives credit where credit is due, tight with his brother Jimmie and he *loves* his guitar and his music.\n\nRIP brother Stevie, you're gone, but your music lives on.",

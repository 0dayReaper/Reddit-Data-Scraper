I remember reading one post game story where he noticed his hitter (John Lowenstien, I believe) had previously hit a homer against the guy we had on the mound to finish the game, so Weaver pinch hit Lowenstien in the 9th. Sure enough, go ahead homer. Not only was he one of the games great characters, but a great manager as well.",

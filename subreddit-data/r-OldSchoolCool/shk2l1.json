More quiet; fewer distant connections. \n\nWhen you were somewhere, you had to *be* there; you couldn't escape into a tiny device. You could carry a book or a notepad, but that was obvious and bulky and only gave you one extra option instead of a whole world.  Thus, you might make a domino-fall with empty VHS cartons instead of texting or browsing.  Light-hearted mischief was prized.\n\nAlso, it was much easier to get that heady feeling of fearfully free, silent independence. \n\nIt was easier to feel alone, for good and bad.",

Every few months we had to stay late doing store inventory.  After we finished, the manager would invite us to his apartment and we would play the \u201cMovie-Actor-Movie\u201d drinking game.  \n\nRules: someone names either a movie or an actor.  If a movie, the next person names an actor in that movie, then the next person names a movie that actor appeared in; if the first person names an actor, vice versa.  You go until someone cannot continue the chain.  The twist is that if someone names a movie or an actor that is too obscure, you can challenge them (if an obscure movie - another actor in that movie; if an obscure actor another movie they were in).  Final rule, if you had to drink three times in a row, the order reversed.",

You'd rewatch the same movie like 3 times, and pick up small things, or talk about it. Or rewatch with other people. You'd invite people over, and it'd be more social.\n\nYou actually would watch a movie, and *feel* the movie.\n\nWhat happens today with streaming? \"Oh movies over? Ok next.\"\n\nYou never actually chew on what you just watched, you just.. mindlessly watch it. \"Oh yeah I guess it was funny\" and you likely forgot half the movie as you stumble into the next movie.\n\nOh and put your phone down. Turn it off, put it in the next room. Same with any handheld gaming consoles or if you watch movies while on the PC gaming etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMake an evening event out of it. Pick one movie, load it up. Make popcorn, get drinks, don't stand up mid-movie to get more. Just sit.. enjoy etc. rewatch it. Don't go to the next movie.",

I remember playing DA: Origins and Oblivion for a year straight cause they were the newest games I could get a hold of at the time.\n\nAnd I loved every minute of those times.\n\nNow, I can get a new game and just be bored with it in a couple of weeks or a month if I'm really \"engaged\".",

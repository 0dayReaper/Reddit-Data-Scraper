It was 3D and was like what an Oculus is now, but with 90s tech and it was all in red. So like the black and green screens of the 80s was red and black with this.\n\nIt was pretty quickly pulled off the market for making kids really sick with nasty headaches. But I got one for Christmas one year as a surprise. I didn't even know it existed until I got it under the tree. Then once my parents heard about how bad it was, they took it away and wouldn't let me play with it. So there it sits. In a bin on the shelf. Mocking me.\n\nCould I play it now as an adult? Probably, but as someone who already has migraines, is it worth the risk?",

I didn't have enough, and my mom wasn't willing to cover the seven dollar difference. I had to leave empty handed. Jokes on her though, a couple of years ago I found one new in box from Japan.

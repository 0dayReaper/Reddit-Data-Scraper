I dont want to lead you on I'm not gay.\" They would usually reply with some variation \"Oh I know honey\". Some of the funnest nights. Later I started taking my now wife of almost 24 years and they just accepted her like family. Can't find that in a \"straight\" club.\n\nEdit: grammar",

Coworker said \"We're all going out after work. We all like you and we want you to come, but we want you to know that the place we're going is a gay bar\".\n\nI had a great time with my coworkers. The fact that the bar was having a 25 cent drink special didn't hurt.\n\nBut the funniest thing was the way they were all protective of me. Our cocktail \"waitress\" was a guy in drag, doing the whole flirt-for-tip thing a lot of servers do; touching me on the shoulder, calling me \"honey\" and \"sweetheart\", etc.. Knowing that he was no more seriously in his flirting than any other cocktail waitress, I was flirting back. Coworker had to make sure, \"9bikes, you know that's not a real girl, right?\".",

I absolutely over salted it by accident, and the pilaf was absolutely inedible. He ate half of what I put on his plate (I didnt taste test it, mistake #2) and only until I took a bite and asked him if it's too salty did he look up wide eyed and say \"yeahhhh....\"\n\nHe still ate half!",

I had no idea really just how stressful being an adult was so it wasn't even a consideration really, she made some cheap steaks and veggies for dinner but she overcooked the shit out of the steaks, normally she's a fantastic cook but again she was super stressed and wasn't really in the mindset to cook some delicious food. While we were eating I took a couple of bites and it was super tough and chewy, all  I said was \"Is you guys steaks chewy?\" and that was all it took, my mom broke down and went into her room and started bawling. My dad just gave me this look like fuckin really kid?\n\nAnyways, that was the last time I ever critiqued anything my mom cooked, no matter how good or bad it was it was always \"This is delicious mom, thank you!\" because I didn't want to be the straw that broke the camel's back. Thankfully she normally made delicious food so it wasn't a huge deal and at the time I didn't really realize just how impactful that comment was and it took some explaining from my dad for me to really get it.",

When she goes away to college, I'm going to gather them up and make an album of them.\n\nQuality of photo booths vary, but there are some where you can pick retro looks.  I was in one that had been rented for a party and actually produced pretty high quality prints.",

Now, are you currently employed? This project will take around 3 or 4 months total, probably filming 3 days a week. Do you think you'll be okay with that schedule?\n\n&gt;Meow\n\nOh! So you're fully available?\n\n&gt;Meow\n\nGood, good. Now, in your past roles, what sort of character archetypes do you have experience playing?\n\n&gt;Meow, meow, meow meow.\n\nSo you have a pretty good variety. In this role you'll be playing a more introspective curious character that has a very hidden dark personality on the inside. What past role of yours would you say best resembles this kind of character?\n\n&gt;Meow\n\nAh, yes. A fantastic film. Well I'm really pleased with everything so far. I'd like you to go see Amy over there. She will help us come to an agreement on what sort of contract you'd be comfortable with. Negotiations are welcome. Afterwards, we'll make contact with you, probably in around 4 or 5 days. There are quite a few candidates. It was so nice to meet you.\n\n&gt;Meow",

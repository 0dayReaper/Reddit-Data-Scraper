To be fair, I admit there are also a number of women in their 40s who are grandparents so that really isn't hard, but I am including those and many in their 50s and a few in their 60s. Maybe I'm different because im 50. When I was in my teens, it just felt like grandparents in general all seemed so very old. Like there was a general view of what a grandparent looked like, and people tried to fill that. Moms were different though cuz i knew a number of hot moms (friend's moms) then.  There are just some people who age very well.",

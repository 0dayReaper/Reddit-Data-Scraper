You know her kids/grandkids would always give her pictures of family and she would pick out the best to display on the wall. The rest we're well sorted in albums by event, each book chroniclling important mile stones though our lives. It is basically Facebook timeline before Facebook.\n\nEvery guest was introduced to this timeline of events to create small conversation and introduce family to outsiders. It wasn't broadcasted to the world like Instagram or Twitter, but was often the world to whoever owned that album and accumulated that collection. The embarrassing stories have the best pictures because you know multiple people took that Kodak moment, especially of it was planned.\n\nThis picture reminds me of my grandmas set up at her house when I was a kid (it was more of a picture shelf actually). It's usually grandmas that has the most pictures up. It was set up right in the living room when you first walk into the house next to the entrance and very prominent for introducing guests to. Usually a starting family has a family photo, but not much else, but grandmas had a whole trailer to show, not just a poster.\n\n\nYou never know when a picture will resurface again, even though you will probably have forgotten about it. When coming across it again after a long time though, some memories will rush back (I still remember the Chong ama with an @ex of his in his mod 20s). I hope the undertaker sees this photo and remembers it, down to the food his grandma stuffed him with that night.",

Eventually, aging laminate will take whatever it's protecting with it. Encapsulation between mylar/polyester sheets is best practice for preserving these types of paper materials. At our archive, we've been given plenty of laminated maps by well-meaning people that have lost a lot of usefulness because of the damage done by lamination. Like someone else mentioned, framing it behind UV glass is also a great approach. ",

The curtain is drawn back and I\u2019m now nose to nipple with the largest, scariest human being I\u2019ve ever seen in person. The undertaker was dripping sweat, visibly tired, and still wearing the menacing deadman stare of his character. \n\nI wasn\u2019t overawed by celebrity. I felt the primal need to leave, right then. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a nice enough guy in his personal life, but in that moment I understood why they call him a monster.

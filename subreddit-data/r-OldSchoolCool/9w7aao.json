The drinks themselves are not the same, and vary between the Sivolvian 'chinanto/mnigs' which is ordinary water served at slightly above room temperature, and the Gagrakackan 'tzjin-anthony-ks' which kill cows at a hundred paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them, beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact with any other worlds.\n-Douglas Adams.

My dad worked 50 miles from home and had to take the train to NYC everyday so he left at 6am and didn't come home until 9-10pm sometimes later during tax season when he got a job for one of the big 4 companies when I was 6. He had weekends off but sometimes, especially tax season, had to go in on weekends too (but for shorter hours). My 9th birthday was the day after 9/11 and the trains weren't running into the city so he was able to stay home on my birthday for pretty much the first time ever that year. As terrible as it sounds I was excited about it (I did feel bad about 9/11 though).",

They were out of style by then so the people with money moved onto a new thing, but still functional and cool so they would be scavenged and used until they fell apart. It's funny how trends work like that. I also seem to mentally associate them with giant cable spools which were used as end tables. I always thought they were cool too. You should bring home one of those to complete the look! XD",

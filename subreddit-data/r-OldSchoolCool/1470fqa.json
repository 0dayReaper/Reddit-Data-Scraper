The boom was built on investment, not substance. That economy benefitted the upper class, and this stagnated the middle class in wages.This was the beginning of the Alan Greenspan era of shaping how the economy worked, and it's been a disaster since. And of course Bill Clinton annihilated welfare, which had 70% kids on it, which was been a horrible disaster for the lower middle class. The mid 90's on for giant swaths on America were burdened with economic hardships that was masked by the bubble.\n\nPopular music from 90 - 94 was dominated by a variety of dark bands that were great. This culminates in Kurt Cobains' death. Slowly, the other bands from this era drop off on popularity. The rise of boy bands occurs. Manufactured groups are now accepted, no one shuns it, and you have radio/TV dominated by it. Your record stores are filled to the brim with these boy bands and pop groups. Trying to get let's say a metal record you wanted to hear involves you ordering it, waiting weeks for it, and purchasing it without hearing a single note because radio and TV are so bad. Napster changes this, but destroys the economy of small indie record companies and a lot of bands slowly fade away or stop making great records because they just tour non-stop.\n\nMTV drops music and bands from their programming. They make reality shows instead. This spreads throughout TV. You have 100's of channels of reality TV and a dial-up modem. So you have no alternative. From the OJ Simpson trial forward, you were fucked and TV already sucked...but the worst part was, the news did the samething.\n\nOJ Simpson was such a massive hit with CNN that they became sensational all the time. This leads to the rise of Fox News which is sensational and partisan. Their success leads to the beginning stages of what we have now. This is also the time that anti-trust laws were relaxed and lead to huge mergers in media like Time Warner. Radio stations across the country were bought out by corporations like Clear Channel. Everything was the same in every city. Even local news just used the national news department scripts on major stories. \n\nMovies moved further and further away from interesting script driven entertainment. Jurassic Park came out in 93 and terrible CGI was being used all the time. You had Quetin Taratino putting out Pulp Fiction, which did great financially in the early 90's. But then you also had things like True Romance, Kids, Clerks, Natural Born Killers being giant hits also. Then it became only Quentin Tarantino movies being script driven event movies...but even he had Jackie Brown do poorly in the late 90's. The original special FX Juggernaut came back, Star Wars and it was a mess. Then on top of this, Blockbuster was demanding edits to movies or they wouldn't carry them in their family-friendly stores. Which lead to further censorship with movies during production to avoid that.\n\nI can go on...",

I bounced between Los Angeles and Brussels, broadband was a thing (not as fast as now, definitely, but definitely not dial-up), great record stores and music was everywhere, we could rip CDs to computers, make mix CDs, DJ entire nights from a laptop. Tech jobs were everywhere. Most of my friends graduated (or took leaves of absence) and headed to the Bay Area and did very well.\n\nI was working as a technical reviewer and programmer from a backpack with a PowerBook 5300 (including a copy of MachTen UNIX, which made a lot of that possible). \n\nA lot of the \"dot com\" plays went bust, but the sea change they ushered in survived; pets.com gave way to chewy, Amazon (for all its many, many faults) brought consumer ease in a transition not seen since the Sears catalog generations prior.\n\nStreaming services were starting, concerts were plentiful and affordable (I saw Tool, Pantera, White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Korn, Placebo, Tori Amos, and so many others). The Internet made it so that you heard about those indie releases, even if the local Best Buy didn't carry them, and you could order them, online or through Amoeba or ... (And I don't think the manufactured boy bands etc. of the late 90s were really any worse than, e.g., Menudo, Tiffany, New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson, Warrant, Winger, Nelson ...)\n\nBooks, too. \n\nSteve Jobs returned to save Apple, which, love it or hate it, made for a better world than a Microsoft monoculture.\n\nThe Jeep was finally modernized (airbags, coil suspension) with the TJ, Porsche was finally liquid cooled across its lineup (RIP the 993, but the 996-997s were amazing leaps forward), the Boxster was introduced (still a mainstay 25 years later).\n\nDVDs became a thing (VHS sucked so, so badly). The Matrix. Office Space. Fight Club. Good Will Hunting. Boogie Nights. Saving Private Ryan. LA Confidential. The Big Lebowski. Galaxy Quest. 10 Things I Hate About You. Men in Black. The Fifth Element. \n\nBut really the explosion of access to knowledge (Yahoo then Altavista / Raging then Google) democratized (Geocities, if nothing else) was such a fundamental shift, I really can't discount the late 90s in any meaningful way.\n\nThe early 90s was a continuation of, and then a repudiation of, the 80s, and in many ways (TBL, WfWG, Sun, etc) laid the foundation for what was coming. The late 90s was an epochal shift.",

But the ham-fisted creation of Vanilla Ice matured into boy bands and girl groups. The record labels behind them slowly formed a parasitic bond with commercial radio and television. These days, you could turn functionally anyone into a famous musician with enough auto-tune and astro-turf. \n\nThe algorithm has been perfected. Give it a couple of years and it'll be fed into an AI, with lyrics written by something that's never felt an emotion or played an instrument. It's just been trained on what sells the most. \n\nMeanwhile, alternative culture has almost vanished. Creating an independent game or movie has become inaccessible to most people, especially if you're not rich enough to have the space to just fuck around with art. Zines have been replaced with feeds full of memes and if that's not salving your teenage angst, you can join the far-right.\n\nI swear it's not just \"the kids are doing things differently and now I'm old and fat and I don't like it\". There's still people out there making amazing art, communicating actual ideas and emotions, fully formed. \n\nBut *christ* you have to dig for it. No more MTV. No more college radio. It's all been absorbed into the great neoliberal machine and if you're an artist outside of that, I guess you starve in obscurity.\n\nWe should have burned more stuff down when we had the chance. We've left a fucked place for the next generation.",

Greene eventually went on to take a lot of iconic pics of Marilyn Monroe. \n\n\n\nHaving a 1930s or 1940s car on the road in the early 1950s wasn\u2019t that rare. They were old only by 20 years and some of those older cars lasted a very long time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder cars and a horse cart were still very much a thing in post WWII Italy during the early 1950s. It wasn\u2019t rare to see the mix of old and new emerging in post WWII Italy in the 1950s.\n\n\n\nItaly and it\u2019s participation in WWII is a good read if you\u2019re into history.",

Auditions are usually during the day and even if you get booked, you now have to take off days of work just to be on set. A lot, if not all, lower class jobs do not offer the flexibility to miss days like that so you could easily get fired.",

Plenty of professionals have kids who go into the same field, but those kids must still get the training and it is a measurable skill. \n\nWith the arts, the qualifications are much more subjective.  You don't need to get a degree in acting to be able to act, and if you're not that great at it, that's a matter of opinion.  There is a surplus of talented people lining up for every acting job and all they need is someone to choose them over someone else. Getting that break is the hardest part.",

Like, maybe it's less about talent and more about how your kids live 10 minutes from an Olympic training facility, and you have the money to provide them all of the training they ask for. We're all talented. We can all achieve great things. We just need the freedom to express ourselves.",

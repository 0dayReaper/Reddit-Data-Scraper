He had standards that he had set, he worked his ass off, and he thought I wasted all the hard work he put in to put me through school. Mind you, I was a sickly child and didn\u2019t know how to communicate my problems(still struggle with it lol), and that was why he was short with me. Every night he\u2019d check my school work and homework and the beatings ensued. For my handwriting, the way I held the pencil, if I didn\u2019t write the date on top, if I didn\u2019t keep my file squared up, etc etc etc. \n\nHe does love me and all, but the damage is done. Once I grew bigger than him, the beatings lessened but the verbal abuse continued. In front of family and friends or whoever. My little brother never got any of that brunt thankfully. But I always wondered why I was an easy target, and in the back of my mind, I always felt my skin color might\u2019ve something to do with it. I\u2019m Indian, and skin color is kinda a thing on his side of the family so always wondered if that\u2019s what triggered him. He\u2019s quite a few shades fairer than I am, and I did get a few color based abuses from him. \n\nWhilst I don\u2019t hate him, his behavior did shape my belief in the whole family structure side of things. Just be better off alone you know? Get that peace and quiet without having to look over your shoulder or have someone be disappointed and then be chastised constantly. \n\nI think the best we can do is either forgive them or forget them, as hard as it sounds, and just try to be the best versions of ourselves and not let those experiences influence us poorly any further. I mean I try, unsuccessfully but still. Hopefully someday I can get over it.",

He had kind of a not great upbringing and family so I try to understand and forgive. He killed himself this last January which also kind of solidified for me that he truly was not well and adds to my forgiveness.\n\nThe skin color thing is very interesting and I wish I could tell you I could identify with it, but I can at least empathize with your words. \n\nAlso, just a note, I chose to have a kid to prove to myself that I could be a better dad.

From what he's said completely random black women especially, and all kinds of Asian people, will be just awful to them.

And older Asian people will straight up be like \"this is a disgrace. How do you live with yourself being with a man like that\"...\n\n\nThen I know another couple where he's an Indian guy and she's a Brazilian woman, and apparently they deal with the exact same thing.

They would call the family zebras. I have never heard anyone use this term except these women. There was no reasoning with them. Their minds were set and what they thought was right was right and no room for anything else. Sad that after 40 years I\u2019m seeing more and more of this behavior again.",

Thanks for replying, and thanks for posting those photos; they're so evocative.\n\nSince you've mentioned what it was like for them in Switzerland, here's a little anecdote about my dad. In the North of England there's a New Year tradition called First Footing. At the end of the old year it's good luck if the first person to enter your house is a dark stranger. It's terrible luck for the whole year if the first person through the door is, say a blonde woman, that person will probably even cry while apologising if it turns out they're the first over the doorstep. So to prevent that happening a dark haired man probably from another village would go round the houses shortly after midnight knocking on the doors and be invited in for whisky and cake.  \n\nOnce my mother's family got over the marriage, and I won't say anymore about that, my father was staying with them over the christmas/new year holiday and they took him round the whole village to be the first foot. Of course they almost had to carry him home, what with all the whisky and the cake. Since my dad was the most sober person you ever met in your life that was quite a strange story for us to hear! But what you say about meeting ignorance: lack of knowledge as opposed to a systematic arrangement of hatred; that chimes for me.",

My grandma also defended him if anyone treated him disrespectfully or talked about him in a disrespectful way. Very soon people stopped or at least my parents didn\u2019t get to feel the prejudice.\n\nWhen I asked my dad how it was for him, he said, \u201cMost of the time I wasn\u2019t dealing with racism, I was dealing with ignorance, which isn\u2019t a bad thing if people are willing to learn. We are all ignorant in some areas. We are all learning.\u201d\n\nMy father was studying medicine at the University of Bern (first sub-saharan African to do so at this Uni. They had had a north African student before him.)\nHe started studying medicine after learning German for only 6 months.\n\nHe was friends with some Jewish students who convinced him to take the medical exam that would allow him to practice medicine in the USA. He passed it too, but refused to go to America with them because he didn\u2019t want to be treated like a second class citizen.",

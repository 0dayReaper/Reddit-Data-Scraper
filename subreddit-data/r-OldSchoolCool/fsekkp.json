She says she feels better in her 60's than she did in her 40's and still rocks \"my little pony hair\". But she is also the one who takes care of everyone and is often called \"the nicest woman\". My kids were shocked when I told them a story about Grandma pinning my stalker up against a wall with her car. Or how she disarmed a robber in the 90's. They plan out getting tattoos together when the girls are old enough. Mom said \"why not add to the collection?\" \n\nMoral of the story, your mom still has some wild in there.

Her smile still lights up her eyes and cheeks. \n\nWhen I turned 18 she came to my birthday party. When she walked in heads turned. She had long blonde hair to her waist. Her long legs highlighted my the gogo boots and little black dress she was wearing. Way to outshine your daughter mom. \n\nI won't post pictures because she has asked me not to. Something something joke about 40 year old warrent.",

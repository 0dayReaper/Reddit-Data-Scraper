I snuck down to my living room when I was 11 years old to watch the first episode of South Park premiere with my younger brother. We knew our parents wouldn\u2019t approve, so we grabbed pillows off the couch and laughed into them for the entire half hour premiere. It was the episode about aliens if I remember right. But what sold us was the commercial for the premiere. \n\nIt was the classic shot of the 4 boys standing in front of the bus stop, facing the camera. A disembodied narrator said to them: CONGRATULATIONS BOYS! YOU\u2019RE GETTING YOUR OWN TV SHOW.\n\nCartman looked at the camera and said \u201cKickass! What channel?\u201d\n\nNarrator: COMEDY CENTRAL\n\nThe boys: god dammit.\n\nMy brother and I thought that was so funny that we decided to sneak down after bed time to watch the premiere episode where the aliens moo\u2019d like cows or some shit (I don\u2019t remember the whole plot, it\u2019s been years), and decades later these guys are still sticking it to the man. \n\nSadly, everyone I talk to and work with no longer watches South Park. They all think it\u2019s an ancient relic full of catch phrases and foul-mouthed schoolboys. Little do they know about the 200th episode with Mohammad or the episode that just got banned in China. \n\nI don\u2019t know if South Park is dying or connecting with a new generation, but whatever it\u2019s doing, it needs to be made aware of the impact that it has had on an aging millennial. And this photo \u2014 the one of them early in their fame and fortune \u2014 this means a lot to the 11 year old me who first watched the show, and the current me still watching them shit all over China.",

Hell I still quote them every now and then.\n\nI started to lose interest in South Park when they began joining their episodes together, having ongoing plot points. \n\nBut they recently put those latest seasons, along with season one and a \"Best of\" season on Netflix. I started watching with my gf (who never watched SP before in her life) and she never knew how culturally relevant it was. She always thought it was fart humour. \n\nWe're now balls deep into the new seasons and I can't wait to catch up and see the latest one.",

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: \u516b\u4e5d\u6c11\u8fd0, b\u0101ji\u01d4 m\u00edny\u00f9n). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.",

He traded a pocket knife for a broken guitar. Fixed and restrung the guitar and traded it for a non running 1937 Pontiac. He put an engine in the Pontiac and traded it for the non running Harley Davidson. He fixed and rode the hell out of the Harley until he left to fight in WWII. His mother sold it while he was in the war because she didn't like him riding it like he did  around their farm (Very fast and dangerously apparently)",

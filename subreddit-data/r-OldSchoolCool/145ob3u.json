It was not titled and so not insurable, it sat in a workshop for several years ignored, until the TV show thought the rear fins made it look ideal for Batman. The car was then modified by Barris into the Batmobile for the 1966 TV series. The car was given a title, so had a legal owner at this point, meaning it became roadworthy.\n\nThe rear fins were brought forward to smoothly blend into the side door and some detail was added between the two seating compartments. The wheels were exposed rather than faired and the front's \"bump\" was taken all the way to the very leading edge. Cosmetic touches for the show were three pipes to the rear of the seating compartments, two \"running lights\" on the top, a stylised siren light, and one extra fitting to the very rear.\n\nBarris then made three replicas from 1966 Ford Galaxie frames using fibreglass.\n\nThe original Futura Batmobile was sold by Barris in 2013 at a collector's auction for $4.62 million.",

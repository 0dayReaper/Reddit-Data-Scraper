Then task my 17 year old self with killing Hitler, then dating Judy Garland.\n\nWait...if I send my 17 year old self back in time, and assume he happily married Judy Garland, saving her from the trials and tribulations of Hollywood and drugs, then I never would reach 40 and have access to said time machine.  Also, once I hand myself the time machine, current self will be stuck in the 90s.\n\nHmmm...",

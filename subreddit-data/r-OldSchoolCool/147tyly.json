But I had an older friend, now passed, who was neighbours with the Gould family when they summered in Ontario in a small lakeside town. \n\nShe said that his parents shipped a piano to the cottage and he basically never went outside all summer.  The kids in the area would occasionally ring the bell to invite him out for an event, but he rarely joined them. \n\nShe said the sound of his playing became the soundtrack of her own childhood. \n\nShe was from Montreal. There, her other childhood playmates were Leonard Cohen and William Shatner. She ended up as personal secretary to Prime Minister Jean Chretien.",

For some artists, there's an ideal to meet within their lifetime and you only get one pass at this life! The incentives related to the concept of missed opportunities can be really intense. From what I understand, he took extremely delicate care of his hands.",

I\u2019m no connoisseur of classical music by any means and I know that the piece is typically performed on harpsichord, but Gould\u2019s performance is so passionate that it stands out. I love that you can hear him humming and huffing while adding subtle nuance to the tempo. To take something so mathematical (and beautiful) and add overt humanity to it really elevates the performance.",

(Sorry, thick brain today) It\u2019s fascinating to read Bach aficionados discuss different interpretations of this work. It\u2019s an endless ebb and flow of preferred styles, throughout the decades.",

He was in another world of music. For me nobody comes close to Gould when it comes to Bach on piano.\n\nIt's Bachs partita no 2 - Sinfonia for anyone wondering.",

In the same vein as this, we have a picture of my grandpa around age 15 in the 1930s in a little rowboat from his summers at the lake. And next to it, we have a picture of my brother around the same age, rowing a carbon fiber racing shell taken at the same angle as the old photo. The resemblance between the two is uncanny even though my brother has no memory of our grandfather. Old photo recreations are my favorite :)",

The one in the old photo was his 1st model shirt. This is the OG107 sateen shirt they transisitioned too before going full jungle fatigues.

He was a private in the old photo while he was an E4 specilast when he wore this shirt.\n\n(Pro tip: replace the 'r' in 'reddit.com' with a 'c' and you can read removed comments.)",

It started with him just confusing peoples names and littler things like that.  But deep down I knew what was coming due to him being an alcoholic for pretty much all of his life.  Last week he mailed my sister a bunch of pics of me from my childhood. I know he meant to send them to me.  Every time he sees me he asks me if I found a new a job since I\u2019ve moved.  I\u2019ve had a job out here for 2 years.  I am adamant that I do not want to live like him, and every day I worry about how much worse it\u2019s going to get for him.  I can see the frustration in his face.  I am with you on taking myself out of the game before it can get to where my dad is headed fast. ",

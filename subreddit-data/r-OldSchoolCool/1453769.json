Now that he's older you can subtract another 1-2 inches from that.  Most of his life he was on the very low end of \"tall\" which makes him stand out next to most average people as being bigger but also on the low end of that he will be shorter than most anyone who is actually tall by most standards.\n\nPeople get height wrong all the time standing next to someone.

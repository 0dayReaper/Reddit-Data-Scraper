He starred on a primetime network sitcom in , I think, 1984, but it got cancelled after one season. He had the lead role in \"Once Bitten\" in 1985 but it did nothing for his career. He was in \"Earth Girls Are Easy\" in 1988 with Jeff Goldblum and Damon Wayans. I'm guessing working with Wayans is how he ended up on \"In Living Color\" a couple years later and finally broke out.",

Well, Mr. Smartypants, ever heard of a little movie called Freeway? \n\n... is what I was GONNA say\u2014before double-checking and finding out you were right lol. I really thought Freeway was her first gig! Come to find out, it wasn't even her second.\n\nNow I have to watch Man On The Moon again, because I didn't even realize it was her in that role. She's a favorite. Such a little kewpie doll.\n\nEdit: Wait. We're talking about two different movies. Now I'm confused.",

The funniest moments. The moments where Carson had to break out a box of tissues because he couldn\u2019t carry on. But a lot of those shows were not super funny and DEAD QUIET.\n\nThey play them at my cabin on local access every evening and I can barely get through half of them. Carson\u2019s jokes often don\u2019t land. The interviews are clunky and quiet. There are whole episodes where it feels like everything is going wrong.\n\nWhich leaves me with no surprise as to why Carrey\u2019s performance was met with only a few chuckles. It wasn\u2019t bad, but I totally understand how the audience had trouble understanding what Carrey was doing.",

But you can\u2019t compare comedy from the pioneers that are doing it to the ones who are emulating it and refining it now. \n2. Comedy is social. There are comedians in China right now that are hilarious by Chinese standards but who will never sell over here even if their stuff is dubbed or translated. Times change and people change. The rubbery comedy that was once an art by Jim Carrey and Steve Martin isn\u2019t appreciated now. \n3. It\u2019s one of Jim\u2019s first acts so of course it wasn\u2019t his funniest stuff and Johnny Carson had a lot of air to fill and not all of it was gonna be good.",

A lot of people moved past seeing that as anything except punching down, and a lot of people today are moving past seeing a lot of the \"uncensored comedy of the 90s and 00s\" as anything except punching down. When a lot of people of the 90s just didn't think it was funny for the punchline to be \"the Jew was greedy,\" it wasn't that they would have thought it was funny except that they were offended, it just wasn't funny anymore. The same is true for a lot of young people today. They aren't sensitive to the comedy of the 90s, it just isn't funny anymore.\n\nAnd *some day*, as people who want comedy to not, say, punch down on trans people get older, there will be new comedy again that a lot of those people just aren't in touch with.",

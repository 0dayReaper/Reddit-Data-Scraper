    "postText": "My Grandmother once told me about a birthday she remembered fondly, and I just came accross this photo of the occasion. \nHer family lived in the back of a pickup , traveling around the praries during the Great Depression looking for work for my Great Grandfather. They had a couple chairs,  mattress and some cooking necessities and they would set up crude camps and sleep in the bed of the truck. Needless to say they had a rough childhood. One particular Birthday her mom wanted to do something special and she managed to make a small cake for my Grandma, and it was a big highlight of those years. When she told me about it she even recalled them having taken a photo to commemorate the occasion, but that she hadn't seen it in years. I was quite pleased to find this, knowing the story behind it.",

So is borrowing the use of an oven from someone they did some work for on their travels. It\u2019s not exactly a tall or fancy cake, and there\u2019s lots of ways they might have improvised it.\n\n&gt; Second, given the abject poverty, a camera? Where did that come from?\n\nMany people who became nomads or homeless during the Great Depression had had homes full of  possessions before they lost those homes. One thing that was shocking about the Great Depression was that so many families went so quickly from financially secure to homeless poverty. There are depression era pictures of evicted people with their furniture piled outside and nowhere to go. Nothing weird about once having had the money to buy a camera.",

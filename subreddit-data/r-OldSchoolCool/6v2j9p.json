Additional observations provided improved predictions that eliminated the possibility of an impact on Earth or the Moon in 2029. However, until 2006, a possibility remained that during the 2029 close encounter with Earth, Apophis would pass through a gravitational keyhole, a small region no more than about a half mile wide, that would set up a future impact exactly seven years later, on April 13, 2036. This possibility kept it at Level 1 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006, when the probability that Apophis would pass through the keyhole was determined to be very small.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.26",

If the news is broadcasting wars, famine, evil, and pain 24/7, of course we'd believe the world is at it's worst now.\n\nThe truth is the world is better and safer now than it's ever been. It will keep getting better. We may very well be the last generation to know what famine is. But it's more profitable for the media to play into people's fear.\n\nAfter Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, the media played into people's fear for months. Many people were scared that their flight might go missing even though the odds of any real issue are stupid low.\n\nBad things are happening now, sure. But slowly we're getting better. Global warming is our biggest fear now, but people forget that just ten years ago, the majority of Americans didn't believe it was real.",

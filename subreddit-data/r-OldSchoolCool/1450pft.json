I wouldn\u2019t want to be out there in May even dressed like that on the water.\n\nI remember that day vividly. I was standing in my front yard and it looked like hell was on its way. The clouds were big cotton balls of grey/black ash with light popping off through them. It was close to mid day/morning when it came over our area and it got dark enough the birds nested and got quiet. It feels EVEL! You know it\u2019s bad when you see it coming and just feel the change on your surroundings. Yakima, WA, about 80 miles north, got pitch black at mid day.",

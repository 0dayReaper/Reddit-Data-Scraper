The machinery broke down and there were hundreds of non-existent seats. Today there would be a riot, and people shot. In '78 we dealt with it.\n\nBoss came out, apologized (not his fault), and they TORE IT UP. Best show I've ever seen. Up till that show Bruce would not play Fever live, because it had been pirated. he played it for us that night.",

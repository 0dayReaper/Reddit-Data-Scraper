Kidman is alright, that was when she was in her in-demand phase, but Clive Owen is basically playing The Simpsons version of Ernest Hemingway, while Kidman plays the straight version. Great concept, some great ideas for visual style that sometimes don't quite work.",

For most people, reading Shakespeare is not enjoyable for the same reason. But Shakespeare is still legendary\n\nHemingway is an acquired taste of his time. My grandparents generation loved him.  They also drank straight whiskey, martinis, and smoked filterless cigarettes...things I (and many of us today) find disgusting.\n\nPersonally didn't really enjoy Hemingway until late in college - by then I had the historical background on Spain, WW1, colonial Africa history, etc. to understand wtf he was talking about.\n\nDon't worry about it though. Taste in writers is personal. My favorite American 19th century writer is Steinbeck. I enjoy and understand his stuff\n\nHowever William Faulkner, also one of the greatest acclaimed 20th century writers, ... I find his stuff a slog to read and incredibly boring.",

That\u2019s not to diminish gellhorn\u2019s many accomplishments. But that\u2019s why everybody knows about Hemingway\u2026 he was a lot of things. He was a brave, insecure, sexiest, alcoholic, depressive blowhard who could often be incredibly cruel and petty. He was also an incredible writer and observer of the human condition\u2026 there are as many great women writers as men but comparing gellhorn\u2019s influence to Hemingway does not make sense. Hemingway changed literature\u2026 but then again, literature\u2019s dead, art is dead, subtly\u2019s dead, and history is dead. So I guess I\u2019m complaining about nothing. At least we got some cool pictures",

Hemingway for press credentials from Colliers so he could go cover the war\n\nGellhorn was salty b/c she had at one time been credentialed by Colliers and seemed to assume it was a lifetime sinecure or something.   But press passes around D-Day we\u2019re a golden ticket and Hemingway was by far the more well known writer so it\u2019s unsurprising that Colliers chose him over her. (There\u2019s also the fact that sexism barred women from ships- unless they were nurses, and that\u2019s how Gellhorn got there- by impersonating a nurse)\n\nNo question Gellhorn was a badass and the most accomplished of his wives though.",

Of course what constitutes as misogynist can be rather subjective. People can like someone without liking all their traits, a variety of good traits can override a bad trait.  \n\nGood men and good women sometimes end up with shitty people because those shitty people didn\u2019t seem so shitty in the beginning. People seem wonderful in the beginning of the relationship.",

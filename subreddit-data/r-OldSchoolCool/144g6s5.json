            "comment": "I can\u2019t put a link in a comment on this sub, but here\u2019s the writeup from a blog called Freud Quotes:\n\n&gt; The Velvet Underground wreaked havoc at their first gig after hooking up with Warhol, playing \"Heroin\" with a film of a torture scene with a man tied to a chair. In front of the movie danced a real, whip-wielding guy, Gerard Malanga. The group's friend Barbara Rubin filmed the psychiatrists, at the same time confronting the 350-strong audience with embarrassing questions about their personal sexual behavior. \"It was ridiculous, outrageous, painful,\" said Dr. Harry Weinstock in the New York Times. 'Everything that's new doesn't necessarily have meaning. It seemed like a whole prison ward had escaped.' \"You want to do something for mental health?\" asked another psychiatrist. \"Kill the story.\"\n\n&gt; John Cale, Welshman, and former member of seminal rock band the Velvet Underground was interviewed in the Guardian:\n\n&gt; &gt; \u2026 what about the night Andy Warhol got the Velvet Underground to play a convention of psychiatrists at Delominco\u2019s steak house? The psychiatrists were appalled. \u201cThat was revenge \u2013 Lou\u2019s revenge,\u201d Cale says, \u201cand I was all for it.\u201d As a teenager, Reed had been given electric shock treatment to \u201ccure\u201d him of homosexuality. \u201cLou and I were going to put out a record with his psychiatrist\u2019s letter on one side and my arrest record* on the other,\u201d\n\n&gt; The Velvet Underground filmed on 16mm by Jonas Mekas at the Annual Dinner of the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry, Delmonico's Hotel, New York City, January 13, 1966. Also featuring Edie Sedgewick, Gerard Malanga and Andy Warhol. Originally included in the film *\u2019Scenes from the Life of Andy Warhol\u2019*.\n\n&gt; Excerpt from the book *Women\u2019s Experimental Cinema*:\n\n&gt; &gt; On January 13 1966, Warhol was invited to be the evening\u2019s entertainment at the NY society for Clinical Psychiatry\u2019s forty thir- annual dinner, held at Delmonico\u2019s Hotel. Bursting into the room with a camera, as the Velvet Underground acoustically tortured the guests and Gerard Malanga and Edie Sedgwick performed the \u2018whip dance\u2019 in the background, Rubin taunted the attending psychiatrists. Casting blinding lights in their faces, Rubin hurled derogatory questions at the esteemed members of the medical profession, including: \u2018What does her vagina feel like? Is his penis big enough? Do you eat her out? As the horrified guests began to leave Rubin continued her interrogation: \u2018Why are you getting embarrassed? You\u2019re a psychiatrist; you\u2019re not supposed to get embarrassed. The following day the NY Times reported on the event; their chosen headline, \u2018Shock treatment for psychiatrists\u2019, reveals the extent to which Rubin\u2019s guerrilla tactics had inverted the sanctioned relationship between patient and doctor expert and amateur.\n\nYou can see the footage on YouTube if you search \u201cVelvet Underground Psychiatrists Convention First Public Appearance Jan 14 1966\u201d (this one is 14 minutes, others are shorter). Note: it's cut together very experimentally \u2014the filmmaker is Jonas Mekas, aka \"the godfather of American avant-garde cinema\".\n\nEnjoy!",

Otherwise, we can project whatever we want onto them, but we will never know for sure.\n\nI'm not saying Lou Reed wasn't queer, I'm saying we don't know.",

My theory is if he accepted it, there would be less conflict. He grew up in the '50's,  when being gay was not something remotely cool to say. I think he grew up with this inbred thing and that's part of it.\"",

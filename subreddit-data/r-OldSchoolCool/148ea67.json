The show was broadcast on the NBC affiliate in Washington, DC called WRC, from 1955-1961.  It aired at two different times in the day, including as a lead-in to The Tonight Show. \n\nThe photo here is often shown in black and white, and flipped the opposite direction. From this direction are (top left) Sam, (bottom left), Harry, Jim, (bottom right) Yorick and Kermit, (far right). Another photo taken the same day showed Jim and the same Muppets with Jim\u2019s future wife, Jane.",

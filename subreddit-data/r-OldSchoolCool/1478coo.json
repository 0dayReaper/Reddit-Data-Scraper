I was eager to try them out / be included, but my uncle wouldn't let me.\n\nMy older brother let me, once he got his SNES for Christmas of '93 (I had just turned 4).\n\nOther than me maybe not being quite ready to clear very tricky levels (the \"special\" levels in Super Mario World, for example), or beat any bosses, I remember absolutely loving just playing Mario World, Mario Kart and Mario All-Stars. I remember, how excited and proud I felt when I finally beat Iggy for the first time on Yoshi's Island in Mario World.... and my uncle was the complete opposite, acted like \"big deal, who cares\".\n\nAnyway, 3 or 4 is probably not too young. Just be nicer than my uncle lol. He is the true definition of S.O.B. / asshole, but video games were the least of it all with him.\n\nThe first game I ever bought, with gift money, was A Link To The Past (when my older brother and I were taken to Toys R Us), and I either beat it in '94 or '95, of course with my brother's help in figuring things out (and neither of us even had a Nintendo Power subscription, or the internet). Anyone's kids now should be fine with games like that, especially if they have access to any scans of the old NP issues, or Youtube videos or what ever \ud83d\ude42",

There were something like five of us there. His downstairs neighbors were a handful of baked college kids sharing a unit, and two of those guys showed up at his door with a system link cable. We hung that shit over the balcony, and it turned into a spontaneous LAN party that lasted until 4 in the morning, at which point the cops showed up and made us stop. (We had been trading obscene taunts about each other\u2019s moms through the floor.)",

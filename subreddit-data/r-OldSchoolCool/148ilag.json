Movies like Natural Born Killers were big hits and seemed so edgy and fun.\n\nMy guess is because it was a simpler time and there was very little crime in much of America so stuff like that seemed unique and interesting. Now, when every day you see videos of criminals on rampages and mass shootings, positive portrayals of mass murderers are just depressing.",

The stork migration along the Red Sea?  The unexpected churning wall of silt and sand headed for me, magnificent and threatening?  \n\nLong ago, my partner and I were in a desert, it doesn't matter which one, doing fieldwork for her dissertation.  Before geology, I trained in (among other things) archaeology.  So we had been noting and in part relying upon archaeological materials to give relative dates of various surfaces, the landscape having been formed through the interplay of sea level, mid-size fault block movement, and erosion - all constantly buffeted by wetter savannah periods and bone dry periods like today.  The various surfaces brought us a huge Mousterian flake manufacturing site, numerous surface scatters, wind blasted windbreaks, trails to nowhere last trod by non-sapiens humans, Acheulean hand axes, and a variety of other interesting things.  For example, a Ceratodus mouth plate, pushing the border of the Turonian fresh water incursion 100 km to the NE.  Hills of ammonites, relect oyster bars, all kinds of wonderful things. \n\nAgainst this backdrop, we climbed a steep and strategic hill, now overlooking barren alluvial fans broken by the crests of fault blocks, but earlier offering a clear view of grasslands full of game, long ago.  We followed a clear and old trail, with modern garbage, ancient weathered windbreaks, an abandoned hand axe, numerous scatters of broken flakes and retouch scatters, sometimes showing where the knapper's knees had been, those many millennia ago.  \n\nAt the top, we took in the view, made notes on map and in field books. Marveled at the scene, a huge alluvial fan parted by our hill.  My partner reached down, picked up a pebble, and handed it to me.  There were no other pebbles, the source rock for it far below us (Nubian Sandstone).  Two flakes had been taken off - not here, there were no quartz flakes to be seen, only dark chert.  The sharp intersection had seen some wear and chipping.  An Oldowan style pebble chopper, dropped somewhere above us in the air, having weathered down with the hill.  Something never before reported in that entire area.  Eventually it ended up on display at various museums as part of a traveling exhibit.  I'm sure my partner still has it - there's nothing thrown away in that house!  That moment of feeling that tool fit into my hand so perfectly, realizing how long ago the last hands grasped and understood it.  That was amazing. \n\nThere was also the time in Petralona Cave where we sampled our way down, the clay punctuated with stone tools and marked by hearths, when the hearths stopped, but the tools kept going.  I like to think I put my finger on the point where we began to control fire.",

The oldest human made thing I know I\u2019ve ever held in my hand was likely a coin I bought that was dated to the time of Christ and minted in Old City of Jerusalem. Knowing it had actually been there and who knows who\u2019s pockets it was in. Was it on one of the money changers tables and dumped on the ground by Christ, had it been in a Roman soldiers pocket, was it in Herod\u2019s pocket? It likely was in none of those but knowing it had been there in that city at that time made it so amazing to hold in my hand. It wasn\u2019t even very expensive but to me the history made it amazing.\n\nI grew up on the Yakima and Columbia Rivers. When I was a kid no one cared if you picked up the arrow heads that were like EVERYWHERE when you were out fishing. Never even thought of keeping them because they were so easy to find. Don\u2019t pick them up now. \ud83d\ude0b I know the real story about finding Kennewick Man too. I work with guys that know the guys that found him. He partied one last time let me tell you! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d",

But Bryson does seem to have done quite a lot of decent research and has sourced a lot of his material to experts within the field.\n\nAll that being said, was he correct at that time?  And allowing for the developments of the last twenty or so years, is it still true that our knowledge of geological processes is fairly limited?\n\nThank you in advance and thank you for all the work you performed during your career.",

When I was a student, birds were birds (although they looked like dinosaurs to me), plate tectonics was going to explain everything, and there were no black smokers.  In my own work, tying together two clearly applicable and demonstrable mechanisms of rifting suddenly made things click into view, and generated a lifetimes worth of more interesting questions.\n\nI can sit here now and come up with an order of magnitude more and more interesting questions than could have been done in the 1970s.  But we know so much more!   I can't see an end to this.  The big picture gets more clear, and shows us all the things we hadn't thought of at all that are or could be important. \n\nSo it's a yes and no.",

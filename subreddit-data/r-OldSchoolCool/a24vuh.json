It is possible for the boat to come up to periscope depth and use the snorkel mast to ventilate which is another means of introducing air into the boat. The normal way is to use oxygen generators which uses electrolysis to separate the hydrogen and oxygen atoms from water molecules. It's pretty neat.",

It was in the tongue of the ocean so that was cool, but looked creepy as fuck underwater. Only went topside once during surface transit. It was my second to last underway and talked the maneuvering watch ELT to swap, which also in turn became the only time in my entire Navy career that I ever did line handling.",

We use air banks for other things as well so we do occasionally have to recharge them but you don't surface for that, you use the snorkel mast.\n\nFor normal ballast maintenance you can just pump water overboard, the tanks the water would be in are vented to the interior atmosphere which is plenty sufficient for all ballast tank levels, so you don't even need the air banks.\n\nFor normal surfacing we do use a dedicated \"air pump\" (moving air from the snorkel) to fully empty the ballast tanks though.",

So the US silent service had a constant presence and a lot of training went into navigating in the north and shadowing russian nuclear subs up there.",

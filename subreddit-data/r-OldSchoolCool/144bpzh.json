Armstrong saved the mission by using the re-entry control system thrusters to bring the capsule under control.  They had to do an emergency reentry in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPilot Dave Scott said later:\n\n\"The guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well. He found the solution, he activated the solution, under extreme circumstances ... it was my lucky day to be flying with him.\"",

Had he not gotten control back, the space program would have been dealt a possibly fatal blow..\n\nIt took hours for the recovery vessels to reach them.  Reentry in the Pacific (actually initiated over China, out of range of NASA stations) had not been done before.",

Armstrong was one of them for sure. \n\nHow much you wanna bet that his experience with the first successful docking, and coolness under pressure contributed to him being named as Commander for the first Apollo mission to land on the moon?",

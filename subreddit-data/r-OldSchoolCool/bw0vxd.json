Reminds me of *The Four Agreements* book on ancient Toltec wisdom that warns us not to assume:\n\n&gt; Humans have the tendency to make assumptions about everything. There are so many things that the mind cannot explain; we have all these questions that need answers. But instead of asking questions when we don\u2019t know something, we make all sorts of assumptions. We have a powerful imagination, and we start to imagine all kinds of ideas and stories. We start imagining what other people are doing, what they\u2019re thinking, what they\u2019re saying about us, and we dream things up in our imagination.\n\n&gt; The problem with making assumptions is that we believe they are the truth! We invent a whole story that\u2019s only truth for us, but we believe it. One assumption leads to another assumption; we jump to conclusions, and we take our story very personally. Then we blame others and react by sending emotional poison with our word. Making assumptions and taking them personally creates a lot of emotional poison, and this creates a whole big drama for nothing. We make assumptions, we believe we are right about our assumptions, and then we defend our assumptions and try to make someone else wrong. We even assume we are right about something to the point that we will destroy relationships in order to defend our position.",

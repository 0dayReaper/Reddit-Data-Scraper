These monsters, for  instance MS-13 members, need to be ended by the justice system to  protect the innocent. \n\nAmerica\u2019s capital punishment system needs to be cranked back up, and I applaud several states such as Alabama, California, Florida and Missouri that have taken recent steps to speed up the process of executions and whittle down the recourse to appeals by these murderous criminals.  \n\n\nYou would house barbaric murders for life. At the very least, allowing them to continue their barbaric ways upon fellow prisoners while you turn a blind eye. Truth be told many anti-death penalty people support the early release of barbarians back into society. Closing your eyes as they kill or maim innocent people again.  \n\n\nIf you believe there are so many wrongful convictions, and you need to salve your conscience, then join the Innocence Project.  I don't have the time to research, but I do remember that it is not unusual for some of the exonerations nationwide  to lead to former inmates committing crimes after release.",

Like you said some will continue to murder in prison, be it either inmates or prison staff. Some inmates (Ted Bundy being an infamous example) have escaped and continued their killing sprees. There's lots of cases of murderers serving their sentence only to kill again mere hours or days of being let out. An execution is 100% effective at preventing someone from ever killing again.\n\nMy only gripe with the death penalty here is how lengthy and expensive it is. On the other hand in the UK it was a fast and cheap process, death row inmates would only be on death row for a couple of weeks at most. In the US, people can be on death row for decades. I think the process of putting someone to death needs a reform.",

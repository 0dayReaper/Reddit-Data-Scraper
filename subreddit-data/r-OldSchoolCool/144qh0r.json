            "comment": "My grandfather was an amateur race car driver in the Bay Area of California. The North California Corvette Association was working hard to promote this event so they paid a good sum of money to get Jayne as the trophy girl. He wound up winning the race in his \u201857 corvette and sealed the victory with a kiss.",

It's always a big surprise to me when I do a deep dive into sports car racing of this era and find out who raced against who in what machinery.",

I believe he continued racing until the early 70s but had to give it up because he was a self owned racer and couldn\u2019t keep up with the guys who were sponsored. One of the big names I\u2019ll always remember him racing against was Dave Macdonald. They were close friends until Dave\u2019s tragic death. \n\nMy grandfather started doing vintage races in the 90s and drove in the vintage races until he was in his 80s",

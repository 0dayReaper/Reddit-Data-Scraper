And moved in the most sensual way.  Whereas Frida just sort of bounced around in a peppy fashion, Agnetha (as someone else put it on youtube) \"was the girl you'd want to slow dance with.\"   Those who know...know.\n\n(And ABBA's own choreography knew.  In getting to know them he took them out to dance and watched them move.  He identified Frida as the spunky outgoing dancer, but that Agnetha, though more a shy dancer, clearly had more overt sex appeal).",

All in the eye of the beholder...that's taken for granted.\n\nJust having fun as an ABBA fan dishing out different opinions.\n\nThe subjectivity of all this stuff fascinates me.  I have huge admiration for Frida as a musician/singer,  and I can see how she can be seen as attractive, yet when videos pop up with the ABBA gals singing and some people fawn over Frida it feels like I'm in the twilight zone, since she has zero sex appeal to me  and I have a hard time not just watching Agnetha.  The more recent choreographer for ABBA voyage spoke of trying to capture how each girl moved, and mentioned how Agnetha's moves were smooth and liquid.   That's what I see, vs Frida's jumpy, boppy style.\n\nAlso, contra many ABBA fans I think Agnetha is actually the better dancer.  Yes Frida loved dancing, and she moved a lot and had her wilder choreography...but she wasn't a good dancer.  Agnetha actually moved more in time with the music than Frida, and in their choreographed bits I've noticed Agnetha actually seems to do them tighter and sharper than Frida.  Part of why Agnetha was tighter with the little choreography was, I think, born of her own insecurity of not being a dancer and making a mistake.\n\nWhereas Frida just seemed to be more in to having a great time bopping around and sometimes forgot what she was doing.\n\nAlso, while I think Frida was the more technically perfect singer (never out of tune; Agnetha could be pitchy), I much prefer Agnetha's vocal, in terms of her special bell-like tone and emotional delivery.  So I'm a biased Agnetha fan.\n\nI know Frida spent a long time under Agnetha's shadow in that way in the 70's which is a bummer, so I'm glad there are plenty of \"team Frida\" fans as well.  I think she has picked up ever more fans over the years which is wonderful.   My appreciation of her singing talent just keeps growing.",

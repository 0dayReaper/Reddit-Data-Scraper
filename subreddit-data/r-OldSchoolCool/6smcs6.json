They can afford the best toilet paper you can find. Looking for the douche that's on sale? I don't think so. Even their diets are so much better than us commoners. My feces are primarily junk food, along with entirely too much red meat. My doctor actually informed me that I need to cut back on red meat. My cholesterol isn't alarming yet, but the potential is there. Unlike my horrendous defecation, theirs is most likely packed with nutrition (think green vegetables, fish, nuts). It's just a whole different caloric intake. \n\nIn short I wholeheartedly believe that engaging in homosexuality with either of these affable, gregarious gentlemen would make for a hygienic, wholesome and pleasant experience.

At the age of twenty-four he obtained his first automobile, a 1917 Franklin. His second car was a Marmon.

Most of rural America was still using horses for transportation in 1928. Twenty miles was a days journey for a horse and wagon, if you were lucky. The interstate system revolutionized America. Now, I can drive 800 miles in a day, and it will only cost $50. At 20miles/day it would take a horse 40 days. I don't know how much it costs to feed and maintain a horse for that amount of time, or how it would adjust to today's inflation. I know it would not be cheap. \n\nEdit: I found [this gem](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/235dje/how_many_miles_per_gallon_does_a_horse_get/) which explains a bit more of what a horse would require. A horse would require roughly 25,000 calories a day walking 4mph all day. I'll do some rough math that is probably nowhere near accurate to the real world. 25,000 would be provided by corn at ~1500cal/lb. That's a little over 16lbs corn/day. Tractor supply sells a 50lb bag of corn for ~$8. So a bag will last roughly 3 days so $2.60/day. 40 days at $2.60/day gives us $104.00, but keep in mind this isn't realistic. A strict diet of corn will kill a horse. [A guy has crossed the US on horseback.](http://www.discoverytrail.org/news/parker/index.html) It took him 2 years and three horses. His first horse played out after 1000 miles. We are only going 800, so let's assume we'll be wearing out our horse. A decent trail horse is [about $6,000](http://www.equinenow.com/trailriding.htm) online, so we'll add 80% of that value to our cost. That's $4,800 divided by 800miles and gives us $6 more a mile. We're up to $6.13 per mile when we add feed costs. We haven't even added other associated costs like a saddle or having the horse shoes replaced by a qualified farrier. You'd also have they cost of stopping every night and finding a place to stay. 40 nights stay at the shitty motel at $30/night would add up quickly. Not many hotels have stables so we're going to assume we'd have to camp. ",

The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.\n\nThe paradox had been discussed by other ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus and Plato prior to Plutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.24",

And sometimes it has required a new handle, new designs on the metalwork, a little refreshing of the ornamentation . . . but is this not the nine hundred-year-old axe of my family? And because it has changed gently over time, it is still a pretty good axe, y'know. Pretty good.",

Don\u2019t worry, the man was already dead. Or maybe you should worry, because you\u2019re the one who shot him.\n\nHe had been a big, twitchy guy with veiny skin stretched over swollen biceps, a tattoo of a swastika on his tongue. Teeth filed into razor-sharp fangs, you know the type. And you\u2019re chopping off his head because, even with eight bullet holes in him, you\u2019re pretty sure he\u2019s about to spring back to his feet and eat the look of terror right off your face.\n\nOn the follow-through of the last swing, though, the handle of the ax snaps in a spray of splinters. You now have a broken ax. So, after a long night of looking for a place to dump the man and his head, you take a trip into town with your ax. You go to the hardware store, explaining away the dark reddish stains on the broken handle as barbecue sauce. You walk out with a brand new handle for your ax.\n\nThe repaired ax sits undisturbed in your garage until the next spring when, on one rainy morning, you find in your kitchen a creature that appears to be a foot-long slug with a bulging egg sac on its tail. Its jaws bite one of your forks in half with what seems like very little effort. You grab your trusty ax and chop the thing into several pieces. On the last blow, however, the ax strikes a metal leg of the overturned kitchen table and chips out a notch right in the middle of the blade.\n\nOf course, a chipped head means yet another trip to the hardware store. They sell you a brand new head for your ax. As soon as you get home with your newly-headed ax, though, you meet the reanimated body of the guy you beheaded last year. He\u2019s also got a new head, stitched on with what looks like plastic weed trimmer line, and it\u2019s wearing that unique expression of \u201cyou\u2019re the man who killed me last winter\u201d resentment that one so rarely encounters in everyday life.\n\nYou brandish your ax. The guy takes a long look at the weapon with his squishy, rotting eyes and in a gargly voice he screams, \u201cThat\u2019s the same ax that slayed me!\u201d\n\nIs he right?",

            "comment": "Her name is Jean and she grew up in a small coal mining town in Ohio.  The footage here was taken by my Grandpa, her new husband.  They had 4 children and were married for 58 years.  She was a gifted artist and cursed like a sailor!  My heart melts every time I watch this.\n\nEdit 1:  I used the [Wolverine digitizer ](https://www.wolverinedata.com/products/new-wolverine-8mm-and-super-8).  There\u2019s a few YouTube videos that explain the process.  Many cities have local small business who will do it for you.  It\u2019s worth it! \n\nEdit 2:  Also, thank you kind Redditors for the awards and all the love!  This has been an emotional project for me.  While I miss my grandmother terribly (she passed in 2009), I also lost my mother (her only daughter) last year.  It\u2019s been bittersweet uncovering the videos of my mother as a toddler through her teenage years but I cherish these and glad I could share with you.",

You can buy a 100% silk velvet cloth to wipe the film with before digitization. The benefit of professional digitization is that they can clean the film for you with a machine, you'll also get the film at a much higher resolution like 4K. It can be quite pricy though, but 8mm shouldn't be too bad. It's usually priced per foot.",

I've never done it solely by hand though, I've usually done it while using a film bench. I have done hand inspection on short 8mm films (200-400ft) and it can take a while. You also have to be careful with it to not scratch the emulsion (the dull side).",

Major Hollywood movies are still shot on film and there's actually a resurgence in 16mm and 8mm due to the aesthetic. Film schools also generally always teach how to shot on film.

Most services will charge you a minimum for the reel because it\u2019s infinitely easier to just run the whole thing rather than taking small clips\n\nFor my personal services the minimum is basically the same amount as a small 50ft reel of film. Not really a high minimum, because I work with a lot of filmmakers and hobbyists who shoot a single reel on vacation or something, but it makes more sense to do the full reel",

The compromise that the producers made was there wouldn't be a laugh track over any of the scenes in surgery. You can tell it was an afterthought when you watch because unlike most shows with a laugh track there's never any pauses in dialogue for laughter. Also the version with a laugh track never made it overseas, I guess Fox figured Europe was sophisticated enough to not need to know when something was meant to be funny \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Catch-22 is more about soldiers on the front line, and feels more like reading Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse Five*",

Catch-22 is more about soldiers on the front line\n\nI don't think this is a coincidence at all. The horror and intensity of combat is just too much to portray clearly.  Even veterans trying to recall their own experiences talk about in ways that highlight how it was more than they could take in all at once: how loud it was, the chaos, tunnel vision, not having time to think about the fear, confusion, fatigue, etc. If you aren't actually in the situation, at some point you will get overwhelmed and the input will bounce off of you.\n\nIt's more effective to slowly work the audience into what it feels like to unpack the experience; what it's like to have what happened sink in during the aftermath or the boring waiting time that war is mostly made of. Catch-22 and Slaughterhouse Five use surrealism as a way to make the experience more dissociated, MASH uses the hazy reflection of combat as seen from the support lines. By lowering the intensity, they actually make the audience experience more of it.",

To my recollection he donated fancy chocolate to an orphanage for Christmas and found out that the caretaker sold the chocolate and is about to rough him up, but then the caretaker reveals that he did it because the chocolate would give them one moment of happiness but the money from the chocolate could buy rice to keep their bellies full for weeks. \n\nThat exact episode also had the plot of other characters trying to keep a dying soldier alive until after midnight so that his children won't have to deal with the fact that their father died on Christmas Day. Both of the episode plots were *exceptional*, it's gotta be up there on the list of greatest single episodes of television ever.",

Obviously, plenty to argue about there but so many people join the military out of genuine desire to \u201cprotect their country\u201d and for family honor and because \u201chey, how else am I going to get out of my small, shit town.\u201d All along not realizing their country doesn\u2019t give a shit about them, their family\u2019s only proud because they\u2019re too ignorant to see what it really is, and their recruiter is a liar worse than a used car salesman.\n\nEdit to add: yes, not all recruiters are liars. Also, I\u2019m not using \u201cignorant\u201d as a pejorative. I\u2019m using it in its literal sense. You can\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.",

In one Hawkeye has a nightmare that he\u2019s in the middle of so much suffering and atrocity, kids and grandparents dying and he doesn\u2019t have any arms to help with. It\u2019s got to have been more than 30 years since I saw that and it\u2019s still etched on my mind.",

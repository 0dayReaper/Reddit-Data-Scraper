It was just an elmo doll you could fake tickle and it laughed, but people briefly went nuts for them. I think the movie Jingle All the Way is loosely based on them.\n\n&gt;The toy was first produced in the United States in 1996 and slowly became a fad, reaching its apex during the 1996 Christmas shopping season, with some instances of violence reported over the limited available supply. People reported that the toy, which retailed for $28.99 according to its MSRP, was being re-sold by scalpers in newspapers and on the Internet for up to $1,500 by the end of 1996.\n\nPredictably, after Christmas, the value of those flatlined.",

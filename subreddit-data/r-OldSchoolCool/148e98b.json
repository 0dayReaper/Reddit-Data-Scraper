When he noticed the injuries to his right leg \u2013- which he says had fractured at the knee \u2013- one of his captors slammed a rifle butt into his right shoulder, shattering it, the account said. He was then bayoneted in the abdomen and foot.\n\nOver the next few days, he \u201clapsed from conscious to unconsciousness\u201d while the North Vietnamese interrogated him, he said. \u201cI refused to give them anything except my name, rank, serial number and date of birth,\u201d McCain said in the U.S. News report. \u201cI was in such a bad shape that when they hit me it would knock me unconscious,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCain says his torture began in August of 1968. \u201cFor the next four days, I was beaten every two or three hours by different guards. My left arm was broken again and my ribs were cracked,\u201d he said according to U.S. News. The North Vietnamese wanted a confession for crimes committed against the North Vietnamese people. After holding out for four days, McCain, at the point of suicide, agreed to write a confession. Looking back on his decision, McCain reflected \u201cI felt just terrible about it\u2026 Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine,\u201d he said, according to the report.",

I think it's possible to acknowledge Reaganomics is essentially the root of the problems we are seeing right now socioeconomically, but he also did some stuff that the average conservative does not nowadays, like advocate for campaign finance reform throughout his career and defend Obamacare from Trump's attempt at dismantling it. He also had a reputation for working across the aisle and was able to do so multiple times throughout his career. In regards to Palin, I think he later expressed regret at the decision.\n\nI'm fairly left leaning and while I largely disagree with McCain on his military policy in the middle east(notably, he did support Ukrainian autonomy and stricter sanctions on Russia earlier on) and overall traditional conservative worldview, it could be argued he acted with integrity most of the time when he could. It's tough because I agree it's rose tinted glasses, but also what happened happened and history's path is the way it is. Doesn't excuse his role, but I suppose it depends on where you draw that line. He's dead which makes it easier",

She had recorded hundreds of hours of tapes of her life to write a biography but passed away before she could do it. \n\n\n\nShe counted Tallulah Bankhead, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Oscar Wilde\u2019s niece, Dolly, among her many lovers; spent millions on speedboats and racing yachts; and even won numerous titles in the sport, becoming known as \u201cthe fastest woman on water.\u201d\n\n\nBy the time she escaped boarding school to drive an ambulance in World War I, Joe was already a legend. She\u2019d asked a male childhood friend to marry her so she could receive her Standard Oil trust money ahead of schedule (predictably, her mother was livid). Joe used the inheritance to start a women-only car garage, \u201cX-Garage.\u201d The drivers chauffered Joe and her queer friends around the London nightlife scene. Once her mother died in 1922, Joe requested an annulment to her sham marriage, citing \u201cnon-consummation.\u201d",

You could walk around it in an hour, but still it was a paradise for us. \n\nOne summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm? My grandmother showed me. \n\nWe buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and... they would fall into the drum. \n\nAnd after a month, you have trapped all the rats, but what do you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one...\nthey start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat.",

But the little old lady who is super nice to her neighbour's and is a really nice grandmother and tips well and volunteers to charity can still hold the belief that the earth was made for them by God and their place in it is a consequence of how God loves them and other peoples misfortune is a consequence of their own sins and failures in the eyes of God.\n\nOr that their ethnicity and culture are tied together and that they are fundamentally at war for survival in a sort of darwinistic sense against all the other ethnocultures of the world and therefor the fact that some nice people down the street who just moved in are from Nigeria threatens her and her way of life, the fact that her granddaughter is dating a Latino man is a betrayal to her family, and the fact that the government locked up refugee children doesn't really bother her.\n\nOr that her country is in a perpetual state of competition over dominance of the world and its resources and that excuses the unethical actions her government takes against other countries, especially those within her countries sphere of influence, because they would do the exact same if they were able to and this is just the natural state of the world.\n\nAnd so on. There's plenty of fucked up world views that excuse terrible actions or unethical behavior. Plenty of really nice ones too of course. But whether their world view is fucked up or humanistic often has only a minor impact on who they are within their community. At least until that world view and their persona clash head on, like when a grandchild brings their different ethnicity significant other to the family dinner with their racist grandma.",

Back in the 70s and 80s I thought we had made some pretty good progress in the wake of the civil rights movement, but apparently a good 40% or more of the population we\u2019re just biding their time until, they thought they had an opportunity to bring back all of their nightmarish bigotry into the daylight.

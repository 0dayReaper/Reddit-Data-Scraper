I don\u2019t think they put that decal there in \u201878 or later in \u201880. Not sure though. When I look back on it my Brother had a stock \u201879 but I don\u2019t remember the decal on the nose like that. \ud83e\udd14 Could have been an option I don\u2019t know about but I do remember them like that in \u201879. I had a \u201879 4-speed with T-tops but it has been repainted. It\u2019s at least a \u201878 or later because I\u2019m pretty sure \u201877 still had the separate bumper that wasn\u2019t enclosed completely by the plastic nose piece and had a rubber bump strip running across the bumper.",

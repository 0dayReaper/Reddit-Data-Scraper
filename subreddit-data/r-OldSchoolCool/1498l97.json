These are two incredible artists from the queer underground who brought both glamour and punk to the drag world with their nightclub shows. This is a special moment in time, just before the AIDS crisis hit San Francisco. It took Doris\u2019s life in 1991. She left an enduring legacy in San Francisco and inspired a drag renaissance in the 1990s. \n\nDrag is art. Drag is not a crime.",

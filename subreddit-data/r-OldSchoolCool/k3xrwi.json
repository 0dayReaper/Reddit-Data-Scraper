The default will become thinking that everything happened a long ass time ago, and not just a year or two ago. This happened to me when I turned 41. \n\nKeep perspective. This won\u2019t be depressing. Just remember not to get stuck in a decade that long ago passed. It\u2019s one thing to tell kids to get off your lawn, but another thing to pretend that you like things better in X decade, then try to live your life, and force everyone else, to live in X decade. \n\nBecause it\u2019s not better. Today is better. Tomorrow will be even better. Progress is better. The past only looks good in retrospect, like flipping through someone\u2019s Facebook feed which just shows the Best Of. \n\nKeep wearing your comfy jeans and t-shirts, drive your comfy car. But enjoy the new technology, new words and phrases, new actors and actresses, new vidya games, new bands, new kinds of music, new food. We\u2019re all on this crazy ride whether we like it or not, might as well enjoy the scenery instead of looking out the rear window down the road to a place you can never return to.",

Jerry died a few weeks later and that was the first time I saw my dad cry. Fast forward to Christmas and we had the ornament on the tree and me being a 3 year old I broke the ornament (I think intentionally)..... and that was the second time I saw him cry lol",

I grew up on 77 punk, I turn 30 next year.\n\nI grew up knowing I'd probably never get to see my favorite bands play (as most of them were dead). About 5 years ago I got the news that my favorite band of all goddamn time, Dead Boys, were going to be coming to Canada of all places (technically just Cheetah Chrome and Johnny Blitz). \n\nI saw them 5 times over 3 years, and bawled my eyes out in the front row every single time. Which Cheetah thought was hilarious when he came to have beers with me after the shows.",

A few decades later, Berlin is one of the experience capitals in the world, with an incredible art scene and a wonderful culture. \n\nI can only imagine, growing up in a tough place like that, dealing with problems just as complicated (and many much more complicated) as what we have, and then eventually coming around to living in the Berlin we know today. There are people who have lived in Berlin for their entire lives, now living their best life in an incredible place, despite growing up in a complicated place.\n\nI was abused as a child and teen, I spent my early 20's trying to pay off student debt, my mid 20s through early 30s have been dealing with serious medical issues and the subsequent debt, I've never had a stable job and every single day I wish that the car that took out the left side of my body just hit me a little harder so I wasn't awake right now.

So she was pretty freaked out, she brought the phone down to me and said \u2018beanselyk, there\u2019s a guy calling asking about my dad and he wants to talk to the drug dealer here.\u2019 She was visibly shaking with terror. Meanwhile, I\u2019m at my computer still triggering the soundboard with my phone sitting on the speaker. It took her a moment to figure out that it was me. Then she didn\u2019t talk to me for like three weeks. It was a great three weeks.",

Your muscles get a really tight feeling like your skin is going to explode any minute and its really tight and its like someone is blowing air into your muscle and it just blows up and it feels different, it feels fantastic. It's as satisfying to me as cumming is, you know, as in having sex with a woman and cumming. So can you believe how much I am in heaven? I am like getting the feeling of cumming in the gym",

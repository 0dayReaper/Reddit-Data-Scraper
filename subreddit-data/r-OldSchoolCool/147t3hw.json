It was a huge show packed in a little beach bar venue. The crowd was so large it spilled into the parking lot. So fun!! I wish I was there in the 80's, but we take what we can get!",

A few years ago I saw Keith Morris perform with Off! in Portland, was a fun one! Keith's been doing what he can to still contribute to culture, he always promotes setting down the tech and getting out more",

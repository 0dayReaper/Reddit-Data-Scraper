The original Super Soaker didn\u2019t hit shelves until 1991 (after being rebranded from original launch as the Power Drencher in 1989). This picture was likely mid 90s. ",

So I took my school backpack and one of those 5 gallon water jugs, rummaged through my dad's tools/supplies, and piped up a 5 gallon backpack water jug to my Super Soaker. I RULED the water fights for 2 summers! Nevermind that I couldn't really move, that was a lot of weight for a kid. My dad was a little pissed that I was rummaging through his tools and scraps, but after that we had something to bond over - creating.\n\n\nI just want to thank you for helping create childhood memories, and giving me a place to start on creative engineering. That is my first memory of thinking outside the box, and I still look back on it when I'm trying to make something work better in regards to what I want.",

I have a 12 year old kid and visits to toy stores have become more and more depressing over the past decade+ (longer, as I was never a stranger to Toys R Us for my own purposes lol). It's all crap. It's shocking how we went from the toy golden age to absolute toy wasteland in like 15 years (and are deep into that wasteland now).",

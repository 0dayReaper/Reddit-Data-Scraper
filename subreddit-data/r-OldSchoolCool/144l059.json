But you saying everyone in the 70s was au natural is just plain wrong. Also, most small nip/tuck procedures in the 70s weren\u2019t so bad. It was when people would have dozens of operations that they became ghoulish, such as Mr Jackson. I also don\u2019t know if he started having procedures in the 70s or if it was later.\n\nAnyway, don\u2019t let trivial things like facts and history interfere with your nostalgic feewies, goalpost moving, and complete denial of reality.",

It's a nutrition thing.\n\n18-19 year olds today genuinely look like they're 14 or 15.\n\nYou can tell because you can look at yearbook photos from year to year, and students looked much older back then at the same age and they now look much younger.\n\nI don't know if this means that people actually aged faster back then or if it was simply their appearance. Maybe the current baby-faced college freshmen *will* have longer lifespans.",

At least in the US the air we breathe today (even in large cities) is waaaay cleaner than what people breathed in the 70s and 80s. I guess breathing toxic fumes all day aged you just like smoking does. And yeah btw, everyone smoked a ton. Even if you didn\u2019t personally smoked, cigarrette smoke was everywhere. Not good for keeping yourself looking young.",

There is no real way to tell if a suit was dark blue, black or even dark red or green. You can obviously tell if it is a light or dark suit. Then you just build from there and try to pay attention to the fashions of the time.  The last point is actually pretty important, and not the criticize the work of OP, but I would be surprised if purple suits or stripped green socks would have been worn at an event like this in the 40s",

They're being taught by people who just don't get it and don't want to be bothered. \n\nAlso, good luck getting unbiased and passionate teaching for history and social issue topics like the civil Rights movement and slavery and stuff. \n\nI was never taught of the black troops fighting on the war; first I heard was from Battlefield 1",

He signed a letter written by Leo Szilard (discovered chain reaction) that was passed on to FDR and led to the formation of the Manhattan Project. It\u2019s likely true that his authority got the attention of the president.\n\nHowever, he was a pacifist, and later regretted even this minor role in the project. Beyond signing this letter, he was not instrumental in the project in any real extent. His work wasn\u2019t exactly relevant either, except on the very basic level that matter and energy are related and thus the bomb could release energy.\n\nI\u2019ve read a ton about the project and I\u2019m not aware of any other major contributions by him.",

So yes, some ideas developed by Einstein contributed to the making of the bomb, but I would disagree that he singularly was the most important. \n\nPlanck, Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, (and maybe De Broglie) were all at least as important to the formulation of quantum mechanics as Einstein, and I'd argue even moreso. In terms of nuclear theory, Fermi, Meitner, Szilard, Teller, and others I'm likely forgetting contributed much more directly to the bomb than Einstein ever did, even if ultimately they were working with theory Einstein contributed to. Heck, even Rutherford probably has more claim to contributing to the bomb than Einstein, and he died in 1937.\n\nEinstein is of course a giant in physics, so many things ultimately incorporate his theories. But I think your analysis grants him a bit too much credit in contributing to the bomb.",

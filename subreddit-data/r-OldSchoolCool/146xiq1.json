Going out to eat was a once every month or two event and portion sizes were so much smaller. It wasn't that we ate better, we just did more and ate less. Hell, even watching TV took more effort between getting up to change the channel and having to go out and rotate the antenna (until we got a fancy motorized one).",

The difference is that now there are really fancy mountain bikes with suspension that make up for your crappy joints, and since you have a job you can afford to buy one.  Do a little research and you will probably find groups of adults (men and women) that are in their 30s, 40s, 50s in your area that hit the trail every week.",

The linear scale of MTB costs quite literally translate to just better components. \n\nAll yall are middle-aged so you should have disposable income at this point in your lives. A \"good\" mountain bike will cost you $1200-3500 for a GOOD hardtail. A full suspension \"trail\" bike will cost you $2500-10,000 depending.\n\nTREAT YOSELF GENX!",

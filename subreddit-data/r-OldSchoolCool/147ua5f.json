He was instrumental in forcing a number of reforms particularly, the EFCC which keeps partnering with the FBI to fight financial crimes. It is a partnership that has helped a number of American citizens recover monies lost through fraud. All that pales in comparison though to the efforts Carter made post presidency.\n\nThe global elimination of guinea worm became achievable primarily due to the efforts of the Carter foundation.",

Aspiring artists make mixtapes and try to get a record producer to listen in hopes it will lead to an album deal. Established artists like lil Wayne use it to experiment and maybe rap over someone else\u2019s beats non-commercially",

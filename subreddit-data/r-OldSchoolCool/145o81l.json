DJ can get along with satan himself, so he just chats with the guys for the whole time he was on board. \n\nso they go to my boy's stop, and friendly guy says \"hey man, my brothers and i have a show later tonight, why don't you come down and i'll have tickets for you\".  DJ, never EVER one to miss a party, went. \n\nhe shows up at will call, they give him tickets and bring him in. turns out it was a table in a club, dinner theater style....  table was right by the stage, dead center. \n\nthe quiet guy was the bodyguard. the friendly guy's name was Greg. \n\nas in Greg Allman. \n\nnever know when you may meet someone famous.",

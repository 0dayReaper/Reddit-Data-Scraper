Up front is fine, but I ha e almost no ass, so the pants would easily slide down.  I finally found a belt setuo that holds them in place there.  But when I'm not at work, I found I like it better when I can wear big athletic shorts and tie them above my stomach.  They easily 100% of the time stay up.  So much better than worrying my pants will fall down if I walk at a normal speed or pull up my pants every 30 seconds while walking.",

The team started out with just two of the brothers, Samuel and Moses, but when Samuel succumbed to the call of Hollywood, Jerome stepped in. The only original stooges from the original troop were Larry and Moe. The number #3 position had 4 different actors playing 3rd Stooge. Shemp from vaudeville days who was replaced by Jerome (Curly). When Curly had his stroke, Shemp was asked to rejoin. His temporary stint  ended up lasting the rest of his life. Joe Palma stood in for Shemp in the last 4 shorts after Shemp's death. These four films were spliced together from previous shorts, with Palma filmed from the rear playing Shemp's role. AFter Shemp's death, Hollywood heavyweight, Joe Besser took on the role of # 3 stooge. He lasted only a year or two, as had been a solo act for decades and felt the role wasn't suited for him. Enter Joe DeRita. He stayed with the team until their last appearance, and attempted to create a New Three Stooges. ",

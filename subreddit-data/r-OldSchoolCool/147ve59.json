The movie stuck with me but when I started hearing the drill instructors scream and yell and use creative insults I laughed. Then got bent for laughing. \n\nI just couldn\u2019t believe it. And I didn\u2019t grow up sheltered from violence or being in trouble. But his acting was 100% accurate. Some of the cadences we would use when running surely would be banned today. But I could be wrong.",

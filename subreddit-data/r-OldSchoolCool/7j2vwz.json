Supposedly his horticultural hobbies have since ended, however he does still smoke pot regularly. He lived in a tent in the backyard so that he could more easily tend to his herbs. \nThe cops were there because my uncle got into a fist fight with his sisters boyfriend, and he called the police on my uncle because he knew that he was growing pot. Since they didn\u2019t have a warrant for the weed they released him. When the police questioned my grandmother, in her best Edith Bunker voice she said, \u201cI thought those were tomato plants!\u201d He was taken to jail but he only spent a few hours there.  He was never sentenced any time for this offense. In fact, the officer and my uncle became good friends after this. Unfortunately, the officer passed away from cancer about 10 years ago. I\u2019m not sure about who took the photos, but my aunt told me there are many more photos from that night because the whole family requested to be in the pictures.\n\nThis post has connected me with a side of my family that I never knew! The daughter of the man in question (my cousin, whom I\u2019ve never met), contacted me after I posted this picture.\nI can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like to see a 42 year old photo of your father randomly appear on Reddit by someone you\u2019ve never met, but that\u2019s what happened. \nOver the summer I plan on flying to California over the summer to meet my Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins because of this post.  Thanks Reddit! ",

He had whooping cough and was turning blue. I don't remember much because I was so young but it involved the cop making my mom wait while he wrote her ticket and lectured her about how to treat cops (she was screaming at him). He eventually let us go. No escort or anything for the woman getting her dying child to the hospital. Just lectures and tickets. Fortunately my brother ended up being okay. It was a frightening experience as a child.\n\nI try to defend police, I've interacted with some seemingly good ones, but most are at best extremely incompetent/unintelligent and at worse they actively use their power to fuck over citizens.

Used to be that fire fighters would wait for police to clear a building before they entered to put out a fire and pull out survivors. Problem is, training a police officer not to save someone is near impossible. So now when a police officer enters a building, they take along a firefighter, who attends to anyone they find suffering along the way, so the police officer can engage the criminals. Many fire crews now have their own bulletproof vests and helmets that they bring along in their truck.\n\nThings have certainly changed.",

He had his fair share of run-ins with the law (non-violent offenses) and so he was known to the local police department. \n\nOn one occasion he has being arrested for drunk in public at a gas station. The officer had already handcuffed him and was putting him in the back of the cruiser. When he bent down to get into the car, a little baggie of weed fell out of his shirt pocket. The cop picked it up and said, \"well what is this, Randy?\"\n\nMy uncle said, \"hell I don't know, it looks like you must've dropped something, officer!\" \n\nAnother story my grandma likes to tell:\n\nUncle was growing a marijuana plant in my grandmas planter. Grandma had unknowingly been watering his pot plant daily for months. When the fruit finally grew, she caught him loading it into the back of his truck. \"Where are you taking that?\" She asked.\n\n\"I'm taking my pot,\" he said. \"I'll bring your pot back.\"",

While my dad was still in high school and living at home with his parents, my uncle came home from college for a weekend visit and planted some pot along the back fence of my grandparents' backyard under the guise of a mother's day gift. Apparently, my grandma absolutely cherished the pot plants and doted on them religiously. At the end of the summer, when the plants were easily taller than the six-foot fence, my uncle showed up in the middle of the night and snatched up all of the plants.",

So one time that enemy was weed and other drugs and they said they were going to destroy it with force before it kills your kids or some BS. It also had racist incentives as black people and poor people were more likely to do drugs so it meant they got to lock them up essentially re-enslaving them. \n\nIt then continued because of money, since private prison companies make bank off it and so does the government since prisoners are cheap labour. Also you got stupid people who genuinely believe still that weed is the devil because Nixon said so or some BS.",

Ironically, we lived in the very same neighborhood that I grew up in just behind Five Points shopping center in Huntington Beach... I eventually had the pic blown up to a 5\"x7\", framed it, wrapped it up and gave it to him as a Xmas gift.... He placed it on his fire place mantle where he proudly displayed it...",

The reason behind that very smile was before all of this went down, my girlfriend, who was present during this event had just found out that we were gonna be have'n a baby later that very same year... It was shortly after our visit to the Free Clinic, upon returning home, there was that fateful knock at the door... It was Officer Bob, who was none too pleased! Funny thing was, that prior to going to the Free Clinic, we had call the police ourselves because of a fight that had happen between me and my sister's butt-head boyfriend... Following up on his report, Officer Bob had returned with the knowledge of the reefer plants growing in the backyard.... My sister's Butt-head ex-boyfriend had threw us under the proverbial 420 bus... Hence the photo opp of the Infamous H.B. Pot bust... True story!!!\n     ",

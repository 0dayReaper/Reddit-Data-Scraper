That's a te tale sign of a talented group. When they sound that good- especially in a small area - as in the studio, that's something few can do.",

Infact they played so flawlessly that I was almost unconvinced it was them because they had turned up on stage in orange Guantanamo jump suits with sandbags on their heads. It was only half way through their show when they removed the head coverings I believed it was them. Absolutely brilliant performers.\n\nReading festival, UK 2008",

I have a memory of an older woman coming out and telling a story about Zach being arrested or something the previous night. The story ended with her saying Fuck the New Orleans Police Department and then they took the stage.\n\nI have no idea if that actually happened or not, because I got dosed with acid at that show, so I don't trust my memory entirely.  \n\nTool played that show as well. I hadn't heard of them at that point, so was skipping their set and headed to the side stage to catch somebody (Sebadoh or Luscious Jackson, I think). As soon as I heard the first notes of Sober, I turned around like \"whaaaaaaa tf is that?\" and beelined to the pit. \n\nThat whole lineup was unreal. Alice in Chains, Babes in Toyland,  Fishbone, Dinosaur Jr, Arrested Development...I feel like there were some others. \n\nI get mixed up with the year before. That one was Soundgarden, Ice Cube, Pearl Jam, and Ministry (they were terrifyingly intense- amazing pit). I feel like L7 or Hole were in there somewhere. \n\nChris Cornell actually got into the fucking pit. Guy I was dating had long black hair, was wearing black cargo shorts and oxblood Docs. So was Chris and he hopped in and moshed with him, lmao. \n\nVedder climbed the damn stage and jumped, as you do. Also ran around the pit like a loon. \n\nOh, Primus... That was 93. They started the set with Here Come the Bastards and just compelled everyone to the stage. It was like hypnotism. Everybody moving in rhythm towards that sound. \n\nI'm so glad OP posted this. I'm going to spend the workday listening to the songs of my youth while I work the same fucking machine and wait for one more goddamn person to point out that \"I seem really edgy lately. \"",

I didn't even know it was Rage's last concert until afterward; I just remember the crowd _freaking out_ during Rage's set.\n\nThey were honestly badass live. You could tell that Zack's voice was all kinds of fucked up (if I remember right, he had to take frequent breaks between songs to rest his voice), but that didn't detract from how fucking cool they were.\n\nI wish I appreciated it more; I was never really into RATM but I think if I had known it was their last concert I would've definitely rocked out harder. But it's still really cool to be able to say \"I was there!\"",

A few years ago when Prophets of Rage were on tour my girlfriend, now wife, got us tickets to see them. I had only heard one of their original tracks and thought it would be a pretty cool show to go to. I had absolutely no idea that it was Tom Morello playing as a Rage \"cover band\" with Chuck D and B Real on vocals. This was the closest I ever got to seeing them live, but holy shit. I was rockin through that whole entire show front to back. Of course they closed with Killing in the Name Of and I absolutely lost my shit. My body was vibrating walking out of there. I don't know if it was because of the complete surprise I was in for, or that they really did that great of a job, but damn. Now I'm even more jealous of anyone that got to see them in their heyday.",

If it's not already obvious, the takeaway is not that that Tom Morello is a bad guitarist, but that being complex or challenging has little to do with making a good song.\n\nThe effort instead went into making the song sound a particular way, not with really wild theory or crazy technique, but he dialed in the tone he wanted for the songs to support the music itself. He locked in the rhythm, he vibed on the stage as a performer. These things matter for the show and the song to land the way they want it to. It shows that he really paid attention to what mattered.\n\nIt seems obvious in retrospect but making good music really is just about the music and it doesn't need to be as hard or complicated as some of us make it out to be as we practice and keep grinding increasingly harder riffs trying to \"get good\". It's worthwhile to sometimes to remember it's about the music not the grind.",

I'm just a few feet from the singer and where the band set up. There was no stage in this place. Anyhow they start playing and I just remember the hair standing up on the back of my neck. I was like holy fuck who are these guys!?\n\nIt turns it was this band named Tool. This was right before Undertow dropped. Later I learned more about them and their music. Went to a few of their bigger shows. Its still wild to me that I was just an arms length away of from Maynard. I also learned that he hated a lot of the fame. So I still feel lucky that I got to see him preform in such a small intimate  spot for a handful of people. He he seemed to really relish it.",

Gwen was just wandering the crowd afterwards in her catholic schoolgirl uniform and hung out with us for a bit and kissed my roommate. \n\nThe FIRST opener, however, before a couple other bands I couldn\u2019t even tell you, was Rage Against the Machine. Six months before their first album came out. There were only about a dozen guys there, standing around waiting for the shows to start. Zach comes on stage, fire in his eyes, not giving a FUCK that he is outside in San Diego noontime sun with no crowd and immediately launches into full blown Rage mode. The few of us there just stood for a minute in stunned silence while our jaws hit the floor before erupting into the most amazing 12 man mosh pit that ever existed.

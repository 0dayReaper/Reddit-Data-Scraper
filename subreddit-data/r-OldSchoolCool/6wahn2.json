It reminds me again to keep a bond with my family, and I know I'll be calling my dad tomorrow to explain to him what Reddit is haha. \n\nIn case anyone was wanting a little trip through time [here is us at my recent university graduation ](https://imgur.com/a/JELfl) in December 2016. Yes. He wore the infamous **hair hat**. \n\nEdit: for those wondering, I believe it was either my aunt or another family member that took the picture. By \"just us\" I meant that he was a single dad for a little while before he met my step mom, and he supported me as such. But we didn't live too far away from some family that loved me very much as well (my grandparents and his sister and brother). ",

Ok I'm awake, all through morning pt I'm looking forward to breakfast (7 minutes of relative peace), then after breakfast looking forward to lunch, then dinner, then bedtime. Rinse repeat. Eat the elephant one bite at a time and use your kiddo as inspiration (I still do that during my PT tests!). Best of luck!!",

My daughter turned two in May and I took so many pics of her as it was just her and I. I don't have family or friends around. And I fought in court to gain custody of her and regret not a second of it. \n\nI have to agree that while we as fathers love with a sensitivity and compassion for our lil girls and adore spoiling them w everything and more of what we never had growing up, it is comforting knowing we may also find someone to want to spoil us and share in the love of being part of the duo that is us and our child. \n\nOP: I love that you adore your dad too. I hope my daughter can feel the same when she's older. Maybe she'll post her 2nd bday pic I took on Reddit, if it still exists. :D \n\nAlso, totally weird, but I wear my hats backwards and I always put a backwards hat on my daughter too. And, get this. She has two dimples. Weird as fuk coincidence. ",

Their mom now lives with her new boyfriend and I'm financially struggling. But my daughters keep me going. I have two. They don't ask me for anything, and I it breaks my heart when I hear them say to each other... don't ask for toys because daddy will have to work more hours... Sometimes they beg me to stay home and call in sick...But I can't. I have a mortgage and bills to support us. \n\nBut I'm happy with the little that I have. But most happy that my two little princesses take care of me too. \n",

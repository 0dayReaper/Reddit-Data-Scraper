He was so patient with me and would help me after school often so I could catch up (and because honestly I'm not super great at math). I did well because of him. He must have been teaching about 20+ years at that point and died just 3 years later in a freak accident. So let him know how much he inspired you while you can!",

Here's a quote from a wonderful deposition which sums up the point rather nicely, in an interview regarding the development of a particle collider.\n\n---\n\n**SENATOR PASTORE**. Is there anything here that projects us in a position of being competitive with the Russians, with regard to this race?\n\n**DR. WILSON**. Only from a long-range point of view of a developing technology... This new knowledge has [everything] to do with honor and country, but it has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to help make it a country worth defending.\n\n---\n\nNothing we do as physicists is useful. I mean, seriously. We don't solve any real world problems. We don't cure hunger, or poverty, or the sick. We don't prevent war, or help them cross rivers, or keep people warm, or give them clean water. We pursue a deeper understanding on the world around us. And as we better understand it, we may better appreciate it for the impossibly perfect thing that this universe is. Our pursuit is a spiritual one, birthed from the very thing that makes us different from every other animal on this planet. What we do is a perfect expression of what it means to be human. To explore the unexplored, and explain the unexplainable... simply because we're curious. We push boundaries not because we expect to find anything, or to solve a problem, but because something inside of us begs us to, and to not give space for that part of us would be a dishonor to our species.\n\nYeah sure, our work is mostly fruitless, and the few problems we do solve won't even exist as problems for a very, *very* long time, but that isn't really the point... We're valuable in the same way that paintings, and poetry, and music are valuable. People look up to the sky on a starry night and feel something deep inside themselves. That's what we provide. \n\nOr maybe not. Maybe I'm just a bit of a romantic mixed with a nerd, and still just a dinosaur and car obsessed little kid asking his parents why the sky is blue. All I really know is that what I do makes me very, very happy, and I'm lucky that someone is willing to pay me to follow my passion.\n\nOr maybe what we do will be useful? Who knows? That Newton dude invented shit that people still use all the time 600 years later. We've barely scratched the surface of what relativity can be useful for (really only GPS so far), and quantum shit, invented only a few years later still has no real applications almost 100 years after it was discovered. But who cares? It inspires people, and lights up their imagination. And you can't really put a price tag on that, can you?",

He would say this at least once a week, usually really get before our tests. I remember one student responded with \"you'd think a prestigious professor such as yourself would be able to get a job at a more prestigious school, maybe one better known for physics...\" He didn't take kindly to that comment. \n\nHe also tended to write his test questions so horribly, no one in the class would understand what he was trying to get across. Too smart for his own good, that fellow. ",

I made a conscience decision to forgive myself for the (many) failings of my late teens and 20s.\n\nI\u2019m not where I thought I\u2019d be at 30 but it feels very much like I\u2019m at the *beginning of something* I feel younger than I did last year. I\u2019m in a better place emotionally and now take a more active role in my physical maintenance. Most of all, I\u2019m more hopeful for the future (current obstacles and all) and looking forward to making further improvements.\n\nIt\u2019s my hope you\u2019ll be ok on your birthday but to do that you have to forgive yourself, look 30 in the eye and appreciate the weight of it, see it as a new hill to climb... and actually climb the thing. I waited till midnight and cracked my favorite beer, I toasted my 20s and let them go; I credit that little moment with a lot of my present frame of mind.\n\n\nAnyway... good luck and happy (upcoming) birthday :)",

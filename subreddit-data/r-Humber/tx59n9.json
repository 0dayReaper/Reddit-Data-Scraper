I have been accepted into the Public Relations degree at himber, but not advertising degree. I'm just wondering if it takes longer to receive an offer letter due to applicant portfolios needing to be assessed.\n\nIs the Bachelor's of advertising a write-off? Should I apply for a different degree program before may 1st?",

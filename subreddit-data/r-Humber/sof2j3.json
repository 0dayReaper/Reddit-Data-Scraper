Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee offer of admission. \n\nNote: In addition to the GPA requirement applicants must possess a minimum mark of 70 per cent in Grade 12 U English (ENG4U), Grade 12 U Chemistry (SCH4U), Grade 12 U Biology (SBI4U) and any Grade 12 U-level Mathematics or equivalent.  [Based off the email from admissions advisor]. \n\nHope this helps.",

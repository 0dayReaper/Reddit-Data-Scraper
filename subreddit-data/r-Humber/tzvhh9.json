    "postText": "I will be planning on attending a massage therapy program here in Ontario this upcoming September, however I am a little conflicted as to which program I should accept. I applied to Georgian, Humber, Mohawk and Niagara. \n\nI\u2019ve given Niagara a bit of thought, however it is a very new program (2 years old) and don\u2019t want to roll the dice on that one. Georgian is an option but it is about 2 hours away from i where live currently. Next up is Mohawk, which would be most convenient in terms of commute time etc. Lastly, I have set sight on Humber as a program and I\u2019ve heard great things about it as a whole. \n\nI have also taken a look at numbers regarding \u2018pass rate\u2019 for each program from the CMTO website and Georgian and Humber are on average 80% and above whereas Mohawk is on average in the 60s. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve had to opportunity to do some research on the individual schools regarding the courses they offer and it seems like Georgian and Humber offer the most co-op/placement/clinic work as opposed to Mohawk which is about half of what the other 2 offer.\n\nAlso, I see that Humber is a 3 year program whereas Georgian is a 2 year program and in my case, a 2 year program would be something I would be more interested in but then again, I would have to live there and that would rack up additional costs. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anyone in this subreddit that applied to one of these schools for massage therapy or know anyone that attended these schools to shed light and comment on how they felt about the program as a whole? \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post but I\u2019m looking to make a decision real soon and hope anyone on here could help me make an even more informed decision!",

            "comment": "I just finished the massage program at Mohawk and it was great. The reason I believe that there was a lower percentage pass rate for the OSCE/mcq as my year was the first year that they upped the passing rate on the program from a 50% to a 70% to be inline with the CMTO passing grade which I think could explain why we had a lower pass rate in the past. I really loved the school and they recently just went through the accreditation process for quality, would for sure recommend",

I empathize with the fact that all schools view their students as cash cows but I\u2019m looking for specific experiences from someone who attends or attended the massage therapy program at Humber",

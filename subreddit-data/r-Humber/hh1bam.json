    "postText": "Maybe some of you already know this and I don't know about the current feelings of curly fries among the most recent batch of residents living on campus (before everyone got kicked out, F), but what I do know is one thing. Coyote Jacks silently added curly fries to the menu in residence when I was in my first year of college and it was such a huge hit that everybody was buying them right away. They were constantly sold out. The curly fries did even better than the sweet potato fries which were also insanely popular. But you may or may not know that Arby's, a restaurant known for having curly fries on their menu, does not have a single franchise location in all of Toronto. The caf in the main campus building has its own Coyote Jacks, but that one doesn't sell curly fries. Curly fries got so popular in residence that some theme nights would be all about \"gourmet\" curly fries dishes. Eventually they started just keeping curly fries ready made behind the sneeze guard so people would know when they have them.\n\nAnyway, onto the main point of this post. The place that sells curly fries. I have searched so long for a place like this. I have called local french fry restaurant all over the city to inquire about whether they made this delicious cut of fry, but found nothing. Finally, today, June 27th in the year 2020, when I had long given up hope of ever eating a curly fry again since I no longer have any friends living in residence (I mean, nobody does, F) I happened to stumble upon curly fries in a place I never expected. Blue Star Restaurant and Bar. The burger shop near BestCo. I ordered Coney Island fries expecting all the toppings of a Coney Island dog, but on french fries. I don't know if what I got what what I ordered or not, but I am so glad either way. What I received was a poutine made with curly fries. This is infinitely better! I was shocked, amazed, and bewildered when I opened that styrofoam take out container (fully recyclable in Toronto if you weren't aware, think green). I immediately took a picture to send to the girl I'm seeing and she was excited too. ~~Not as excited as me of course because I was the one who had the pleasure of eating them.~~ \n\nGuys, if you love curly fries as much as I do then you gotta check this place out. I am not a paid spokesperson nor am I any way affiliated with the Blue Star Restaurant and Bar. I am not here to advertise to you. I'm just a girl who loves curly fries so dang much. I am here to spread the gospel. Curly fries are amazing and you should do yourself a favour and head down to Blue Star Restaurant and Bar to get yourself some. This is no joke. I have rarely been as enthusiastic about anything in my life as I am about this restaurant making curly fries accessible to me once more. And remember folks, support small businesses. Communities flourish when you don't play into the pockets of big corporation. Go get yourself some dang curly fries!\n\n\u2764\u270c\n\nAnd no, I refuse to proof-read this post, so if it's hard to understand well then you're just going to have to deal with it.",

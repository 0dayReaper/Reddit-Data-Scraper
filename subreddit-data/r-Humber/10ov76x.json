    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey guys I just received my offer letters from sheridan and humber under bachelor's of industrial design. Since then I'm really confused since I'll get the main campus for Humber (north) while the Oakville campus for Sheridan. Can someone guide me through this so that I can finally make my decision?\n\nThanks in advance.",

In industrial design you will likely need to make stuff for assignments while you're at home rather than doing everything in the classroom or even doing everything digitally. It's nice to get out of the house once in a while for class, but the campus doesn't really factor into that. It's more important how your classmates behave during class for getting in a good mindset.",

Can you compare the two on the basis of courses since you seem really experienced in the field. \n[Sheridan](https://www.sheridancollege.ca/programs/bachelor-of-craft-and-design-industrial-design#tab=courses)\n[Humber](https://appliedtechnology.humber.ca/programs/bachelor-of-industrial-design.html)",

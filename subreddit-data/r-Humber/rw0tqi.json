It's hard for me to tell based on the two course descriptions for the courses from the two respective institutions. I was hoping the professor would be able to tell how similar the two courses are. The office that handles transfer credits has not been of any help, all they want is my money. I they sent the same generic message both times that I asked, asking for money. Although perhaps that is because they don't know the finer details between the two courses. The professor would know this.\n\nThe description of the program at Humber College\n\nThis course prepares students for research projects by introducing and exploring various quantitative techniques. Students learn to interpret, analyze and present statistical and other quantitative data from a variety of sources. Topics include the role and characteristics of data in statistical studies; the principles of data collection, including sampling techniques and estimation; the statistical analysis of one- and two-variable data; probability distributions; and the presentation of data using graphical tools.\n\nCourse Code: RSMT 1500\n\n\n\nThe description of the program at Durham College\n\nThis course is designed to equip the student with a working knowledge of descriptive statistical methods. Emphasis is balanced among theoretical concepts, calculations, and data interpretation. Major topics covered include: frequency distributions; graphic presentation of data; measures of central tendency and variation; probabilities; normal probability distribution; sampling and central limit theorem; estimation and confidence intervals; and, linear correlation and regression. The course makes extensive use of the statistical capabilities of Excel.\n\nCourse Code: STAT 2200 - 03",

Also, you are asking if the professors can tell you how similar the classes but most professors won't be able to answer that because they don't teach at that institution. \n\nYou can find more information here:\n\nhttps://humber.ca/transferoptions/transfer-in/transfer-credits.html",

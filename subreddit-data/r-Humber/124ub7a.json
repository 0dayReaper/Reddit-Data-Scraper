    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a few questions about the commute going to Humber North Campus.\n\nHow crowded does TTC 996 Wilson express get during school hours? How safe is it? How accurate is the bus schedule? (I will be traveling from York Mills Station)\n\nAnd is there an alternate/ faster way to get to Humber campus? (via public transportation)\n\nAny input is highly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Bus is frequent enough that shouldn't be bad crowding, despite recent events TTC buses are generaly safe especially in daytime, there is minor time difference if you take non express routes so you can take those as well, check Google maps.",

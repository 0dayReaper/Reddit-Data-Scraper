    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI got into Humber for the Bachelor of Creative Advertising (Fall 2023). I got my offer letter back in February and they set the deadline for my tuition fees to be paid on the 13th of April, 2023 (2 days from now).\n\nThough everything was going according to our plan, something really unexpected and unfortunate happened and my father is temporarily financially stressed. He is going to try his very best to pay the fees by the deadline but that could also not be the case.\n\nIn that scenario, I wanted to know if the late payment (by a week or two) will negatively affect my admission and if there is any way I can get an extension or leniency. \n\nI already reached out to Humber but they take a lot of time to reply to international students.\n\nI would love if someone with a similar experience in terms of late tuition payments could pitch in and help me explore my options.\n\nThankss!",

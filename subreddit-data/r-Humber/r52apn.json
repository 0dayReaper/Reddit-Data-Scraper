I got an offer from Humber, Centennial and Sheridan and I'm just trying to decide which program is best, so if anyone has any thoughts/opinions about the 2 year Humber Paralegal program it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nI'm also considering taking Humber's 4 year Paralegal degree, in case anyone knows anything about that.\n\nThanks!",

I\u2019m not sure about the specifics of how that would work. I know that I for sure want to get a bachelors though because my plan is to go to law school one day. \nSo I guess my specific questions would be:\n\n1. Would it be cheaper to do the two year diploma and then transfer to the bachelor program? \n\n2. Would other programs (i.e Sheridan/Centennial) be eligible programs for the degree upgrade program? \n\n3. Do you have any regrets about the program/things you wish you had known beforehand? \n\n4. If I were to do the degree program, would I have to transfer during my last year, or would I have to finish the course first? \n\nThanks in advance!",

I ended up going with the Bachelor of Paralegal studies at Humber because I got a bunch of scholarship money and it leaves the door open for Law school down the road. The lakeshore campus at Humber is also one of the most beautiful I\u2019ve seen.\n\nHope that helps and best of luck!",

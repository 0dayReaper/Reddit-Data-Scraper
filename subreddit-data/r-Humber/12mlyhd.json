Once signing, they\u2019ve ensured the info is correct and you aren\u2019t held accountable anymore.\n\nLastly, when first starting you\u2019ll always require a supervisor override meaning, before completing a transaction you will require a manager to review and complete it.\n\nAgain, outside of the financial district I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot more \u201ceasier\u201d and it\u2019s just basic day to day transaction and bill payments etc.",

    "postText": "The estimated date for the release of the rest of my OSAP money has changed like 3 times already. \n\nFirst, it said between Jan 4th and Jan 8th, then when I checked the OSAP website after I didn't get it, it said it would be released between Jan 11th and Jan 13th. I checked OSAP again this morning because I still didn't get the money and now it says I should receive it between Jan 14th and Jan 18th. \n\nIs this happening to anyone else or is it just me? \n\nIt's seriously stressing me out. I know we have until the end of this month before the balance of fees is due but this is my only way of paying for tuition and I would rather have this out of the way as soon as possible instead of waiting until a few days before the due date to pay it.",

They are supposed to start this week (based on a call to the Financial Aid office that one of my classmates made) \n\nHopefully the enrollment confirmation process is a quick one, it's really just a matter of time. \n\nHope that helps :)",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI applied for the four year nursing program as well as the accelerated one in late October. I did a professional development certificate program through Queen's University from September to late January. I was rejected from the four year program in early December and still have \"no decision\" for the accelerated program.  I'm just curious as to when I will hear back or if I even have a chance. My last 60ish credits gives me an 82% average and I completed the certificate program with a 96% average (sorry I don't know how those convert to humber GPA). My Queen's transcript was submitted the ending of January and one of the admissions officers confirmed via email that is was received and added to my application on February 9th. Most of my worry comes from the fact that the myhumber website still says I don't meet the program requirements even though they got my final transcript.",

Do you have all of this as well? I also applied in October for the 2nd entry nursing but my application says no decision yet. Hopefully all of us  will get in\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e",

An individual in another thread said they look at these high school credits as a check off and  focus on university grades more. Two people said admissions told them they focus on university averages of 80%+ even though the minimum is 74% because it is a highly competitive program. Someone said they applied to second entry in November and got rejected so I guess no decision means there is still hope right now. Fingers crossed!!",

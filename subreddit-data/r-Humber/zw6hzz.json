A lot of job opportunities after if you make good connections. Co-op is the most important thing about this program. Please do coop and make sure to keep connection with that company. Most people who did coop stream with me finished school and find a new job right after. Also side note avoid professor Leon King at absolutely all costs. Even if they other professors lecture time is at 8am make sure ur not with Leon king",

Pretty much focusing on software at first. Then sem 3-5 you switch to more hardware then sem 5-6 is p much full software. Job search is super hard but I got lucky by having connections from my coop to get interviews here and there",

May I ask you how is your employment search going after completing the CET program, and what type of jobs would you say your studies prepared you for..? I would also like to ask, if you had the opportunity to learn any network, administration, or security based studies..?  \nThank you very much for your time.",

Good question honestly nothing specific but stuff life software programming and software development (can't remember exactly what they were called) but they helped me with ways tech companies work and words they use In day to day basis like agile development. The programming courses were nice to give you like a good idea of how to code which were useful. The Algorithms class was super super important make sure you take it with Andrew ruder. Last thing is a great question. I actually did learn something else on the side and it was Microsoft Dynamics 365/ Power Platform development and that's how I got my job and coop. Look it up and try to learn it or even get a certificate like PL-900. super new industry and they heavily need people all the time",

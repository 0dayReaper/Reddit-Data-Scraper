    "postText": "Hi, I just got accepted into the practical nursing program for this fall term. (I did apply late in june, hence why i received my letter later). I wanted to know insight on how the schedule/timetable looks right now. I am not able to register for classes since i have to pay my tuition but i am doing osap and waiting for the school to acknowledge so they can allow me to register. \n\nI am also hoping to find new friends who are starting the same year so we can form a little group for studying and making friends! \n\nIf theres any final years or graduates from the program who have advice for first year RPNS comment below. \n\nThank you!",

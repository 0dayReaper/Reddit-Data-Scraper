    "postText": "Hello everyone, Im a 2nd year Architectural Tech student at Humber and Im looking to join the Bachelor of Interior Design Program after finishing Arch Tech. I looked at the requirements for admission, I have everything but a portfolio.\n\nI would like to take advantage of my time between now and then and utilize it to build a portfolio. Any suggestions on what I could produce on my own time to make a portfolio?",

If not, you may want to look up some tutorials on two-point perspective which is used most commonly when drawing smaller-scale things like products or rooms (as opposed to entire buildings).\n\nSubmission #4 in the portfolio requirements needs something \"of your choice\" based on some guidelines. Odds are you will have something done in Arch Tech that you are proud of and can use for that submission. \n\nOne of the most important things for making a good portfolio is to keep it clean, uncluttered. You can look up plenty of good examples on Behance. Hell, mine was literally made in MS Word and they somehow let me in. Just make it simple, easy to read, and use the same text colours and fonts throughout.\n\nHope this helps you get started, and best of luck!",

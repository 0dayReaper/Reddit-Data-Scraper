            "comment": "Hi, I had the same freak out this afternoon. \n\nSo you have the first two weeks online to check with Profs and the critical path if you have lab days. Courses may open on Monday since faculty is on work-to-rule right now. (Meaning they don't work outside of contractual hours)\n\nAnother thing you can do now, is check the courses on MyHumber in your Registration Information for Winter 2022. Click on them to open a little window that tells you instruction type. You'll see whether it's classroom instruction, laboratory or a hybrid. The schedule details section doesn't show it, so will need to click on course.\n\nHope this helps! \nP.S. If you do have a lab and it's your first time on campus, see if you can go some day before to find your classroom building/know the time it takes to get there. This is presuming they'll allow us on campus for basic check around.",

(At least for me, I'm starting same course, campus, Winter 2022) \n\nAsking me to register in section\u00a0WLA,\u00a0CRN\u00a06800 and it says there's no scheduled time for it.",

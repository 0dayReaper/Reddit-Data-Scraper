    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI just finished high school (graduated in June and came back for a 5th year that finished in January) and I've been accepted into Humber's Bachelor of Film and Television program. I was just wondering if someone in the program on here could tell me a bit about it, what the professors and workload is like, hands on vs theory, and co-op, as well as graduate success rate in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\n\\-Ian",

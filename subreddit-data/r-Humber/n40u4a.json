    "postText": "Hello, this post is for everyone who is taking the PreHealth Sciences at Humber.\n\nAfter you applied at Humber, you are required to do an Admission Test and you will be tested on MATH and ENGLISH ONLY. \n\nMATH: \nmake sure you know your basic Long division, Conversion Metrics (g to mg, kg to lbs, etc) also there will be word problems! :) LOTS OF DECIMALS! Subtracting and addition with decimal numbers. \nThere will be 45 questions on the Test. \n\nPractice math link: \n\nlink https://healthsciences.humber.ca/sample-math-questions/sample-math-questions.html\n\nEnglish portion: you will be given a passage, and you\u2019ll be asked to give an opinion based essay 300~600 words. Make sure to write clearly as possible, and have your points be sold. \nFor my question, I was asked \u201cdo you think deception-pretending has good or bad outcome?\u201d \n\nYou\u2019ll have an hour EACH. So One hour for the Essay, One hour for the math portion.\n\nPlease comment down below if you have any further questions :)",

            "comment": "For those who might be wondering what the program if for:\n\nThis program is designed for individuals who did not take any sciences/math in highschool (Grade 11 &amp; 12), or any students who wishes to upgrade their marks from highschool to get into their next pathway. \n\nIt\u2019s a one year program, which included labs for experiments.\n\nIf you are someone who is taking this program and wishes to get into Nursing. You may do so. If you wish to get into the Registered Nursing program, I believe as long as you pass the program with a 75% average or higher.\nThough keep in mind that, if everyone in the program does well they will pick students with the highest average.",

    "postText": "Hello, \n\nI am currently preparing for the Paramedic Entrance Exam, and was wondering if anyone has written it recently and has any advice? was the test super difficult?\n\nI took university level biology and chemistry in high school and did well in both, so I have a decent grasp on the basics. Some posts have said that if you don't get 100% you won't get in, whereas others have said that an 85% will get you in, so I'm not sure what to expect for the exam, or what to expect competition wise. \n\nI have no volunteer experience in the health field, and no prior health degree, however I have gotten my CPR-C and First Aid cert., BLS cert., oxygen therapy cert., and airway management cert. I also graduated with a specialist High school Major (SHSM) qualification, which meant I did a lot of learning programs (over 100 hours in events I believe) in high school such as infectious disease control simulations, looking at real cadavers, etc. I am also currently beginning a Personal Support Work (PSW) position, and will be doing that until I leave for school. Does anyone know how useful these things can be when applying? \n\nThank you in advance!",

They will take all the highest scoring applicants off the top so each year the grade that gets you in will fluctuate based on how well everyone did. Extra curricular and relevant volunteer experience is important to your application as well. I did pre-health at Humber and most of us we\u2019re trying to get into Nursing or Paramedic.",

            "comment": "Hello,\n\nI figured I would help clarify humber's paramedic admission process. I do not have exact numbers but roughly 70% of your addmission profile is based on the grade recieved on admissions test. They take the average of your math, bio and chem. English is only used to determine your english class. Then we have up to 10% profle based on if you have attended university or college. The last 20% is based on your previous job experience, certifications and informal essay.\n\nNOTE: It is most competitive in the sense that they do not take high school, college or university grades and its based solely on addissions test. Only your education level matters for 10% of profile. Thus, people with degrees or poor high school marks it gives a level good opportunity to get in. \n\nExample: Profile score\n\n80% on test x 70% weight = 56\n\n10% education boost = 10\n\n80% profile score x 20% weight = 16\n\nTotal score= 82% profile score \n\nCutoff for 2023 addmision = 80% \n\nPlay around with your numbers on what you would need to get in but that is how it works!!\n\nThanks,\n\nConfused Hobbit",

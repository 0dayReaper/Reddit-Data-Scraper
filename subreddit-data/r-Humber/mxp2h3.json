    "postText": "Hey all! Me and a good friend have been working on our capstone project for the Game Programming course at Humber for the last 2 years and it has just recently been finished.  There are also a full team of Humber students that have been working on all our art assets, sound effects and music! A very large cross-program collaboration! (We also have 2 Sheridan students who have consistently volunteered their time to helping the project) It would mean a lot if you would play through it and give us any feedback you have!  \n\n\nDouble Agent is a Steam Multiplayer co-op stealth-based spy simulator focused on using equipment and environment strategy to complete objectives however the player sees fit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Game page:\n\n[https://cjor100.itch.io/doubleagent](https://cjor100.itch.io/doubleagent)\n\nThe trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLZFk0jeuj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLZFk0jeuj8)\n\nHumber repository submission:\n\n[https://library.humber.ca/collections/repository/content/double-agent](https://library.humber.ca/collections/repository/content/double-agent)",

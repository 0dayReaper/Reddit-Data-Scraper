    "postText": "Hi, I am an international student at Humber College North campus, I am pursuing a Web development course, I am in my 2nd semester, I am looking for an answer from alumni of this course, before taking this course I read the fees quote it clearly said the total fees of this course for international student was $21475, which I fully paid, I still have old quote which says total fees was $21475, furthermore, I found out they updated the fees quote in my humber and now it says its 31k something, they are asking for 10k more for my 3rd semester. Previously it was showing $440 which I paid. There was no mention of 10k for the 3rd semester, I am really in shock, please please someone give me an answer, because college staff are not responding.\n\nThanks in advance.",

But you can also check out tutors.\nhttps://humber.ca/learningresources/peer-tutoring\n\nAs for notes, it's best to take them yourself so you know for sure that the information is correct. And although the content might be the same, each Prof teaches differently so the notes and exam questions/ type may differ.",

It will get you ready for Patho I &amp; II.\n https://libribook.com/ebook/getfile1/33848/MzM4NDg=?__cf_chl_tk=30LA49Kdsr2VPCW7BI7Cxw2OwNue5WD.FlRupBAzVMI-1675867961-0-gaNycGzNCPs\n\nFor Pharm class know your:\n\nNSAID\nStatins\nWarfarin\nCardiac\nAntipsychotics\nAntidepressants\nCalcium channel blockers\nAntihistamines\nBlood pressure regulating drugs\n\nThis will be a great start. I'm sure I am missing a few, but if you cover these over the summer, you will have NO stress what so ever.",

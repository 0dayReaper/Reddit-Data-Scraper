    "postText": "I recently got accepted into Humber\u2019s RN Honours Program (4 years) starting September 2023!\n\nHow is the program? The level of difficulty? Are the clinical instructors supportive? \n\nI am from Vancouver and I was in a nursing program in 2019. I had a traumatic experience with that program\u2019s lack of support and empathy. The clinical instructor bullied me into dropping out in second year. After some healing time, I finally have the courage to go back to nursing school as nursing is my passion - even if it\u2019s starting from zero again. \n\nI also got accepted into the new Seneca 4 year program. \n\nIf anyone could provide me with some insights on how the Humber program is, it would be hugely appreciated! I just want to make sure I make the right decision the second time!",

It\u2019s only difficult if your not willing to put the grind in. You gotta stay on top of all your work meaning you wanna do ur readings before each class so u have a basic understanding so when it\u2019s taught in class you fully understand it then you wanna review what u learned. So if your habits aren\u2019t good you may have a hard time.",

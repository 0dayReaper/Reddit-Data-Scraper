    "postText": "Hello! i'm Sol whi currently living in Korea, just graduated highschool and will be applying to Humber college (and also George brown and Centennial college :) ) after finishing 2 years in the army starting September (in Korea if i don't go to the army i might get locked up somehow.)\n\nUm.. so My concern is... What's an EAP?? (English for Academic Purposes).. How does it work?, is it an Pathway program?\n\nIf i take the EAP will i be able to get into the college (degree programs etc) without IELTS or TOEFL?\n\nDo i have to still submit my Portfolio even after finishing the EAP?\n\nI'm applying for the  3-year Graphic design course in 2022( if possible), Does EAP works for all kinds of programs?..\n\nIt will be so helpful with some tips or like literally anything.\n\nAnd.. sorry for the bad english, still learning.. Also! i post my design? artworks in instagram! username:Visualocto, if would be so awesome to share stuff.... :)\n\nHope this corona shit gets over soon, this virus destroyed almost half of my dreams, i hope i can go to this college. i just want to fucking learn.",

            "comment": "Hey! EAP is basically a program where you learn English and stuff to get you on level for Humber's academic requirements for English. If you pass the entire program successfully, you don't need the IELTS or TOEFL. \n\nMost programs will accept EAP. I don't fully know how the EAP works since I'm not an international student but I hope this helps you! If you have any Humber questions, you can always PM me!\n\nAlso I checked out your Instagram, it's really cool! You're super talented.",

I'm entering my third year this March. If you're curious about the program or anything like that, let me know. I would be more than happy to share my experiences so far.",

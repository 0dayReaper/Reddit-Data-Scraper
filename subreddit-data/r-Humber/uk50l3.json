They're simply far less lenient than even science courses in university. That being said, UofT isn't a good place to compare anything to. UofT will drop anyone's GPA simply to maintain the prestige. Waterloo, give or take, you could probably do well if you brush up on Physics and math(mainly calculus).  \n\n\nIf you're not going to either of those, you could be fine with your level of knowledge. Look for the easiest university possible. Past those two, brand name doesn't matter. Maybe even transfer into Humbers program.",

            "comment": "They're not comparable. There is also a lot less practical application in a university setting.  I would say both involve a lot of 'work' but university is a different kettle of fish. I know people who did both and they do say if you do did 90s in college with the same work ethic you could probably swing 70s in Uni. Depends on you as a person as well - I know a student from Humber who went onto to uni he basically got high 80s without doing any study at Humber but he hated uni. He still quite easily got ok grades but dropped out because he couldn't be bothered with all the what he called 'fluff'. \n\nIt's why it also looks much better when you did well at college, did extra curricular and or worked. Employers then know you tried to get the most out of it. \n\nYou should look into the programs Humber is offering now they're trying to do a more integrated approach to an engineering degree.\nAlso UofT as already mentioned is meant to be pretty ridiculous so probably not the best comparison. \n\nAlso there is the question too of is getting high grades in the uni setting worth it - relating similarly to doing the extra curricular at college.  I know someone who graduated from UofT and they opted to do what they could to have good academic standing and then spent more of their time in the engineering clubs because that actually ended up helping them get the job they wanted because of their project portfolio. Something to think about.\n\nSource: 94% Grade Humber Electromechanical Technology/work with a lot of uni grads and also considering uni",

My biggest pet peeve is that the school teaches you little to no critical thinking skills like we had at Humber. It's literally here's how to do some math, do this math on the exam, and that's it that's the whole fucking program and i hate it.",

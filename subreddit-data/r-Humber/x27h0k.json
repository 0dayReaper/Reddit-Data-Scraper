    "postText": "I still haven't received my study visa for September intake so I had requested deferment recently. However with the new update of continuing the studies online for the semester, I am confused if I should start studying online or wait for deferment and join once I have a response on my visa application.\n\nI will be joining IGS campus for IT Solutions. \n\nThe deadline for response is tomorrow so any inputs from current students would be helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!",

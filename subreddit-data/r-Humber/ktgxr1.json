    "postText": "There are many 4th year nursing students that are being held back to do consolidation in the summer due to lack of available placements. Lots of heartbreak.\n\nI messed up. I missed a meeting to work for my newborn, missed a single piece of important information which led to me disobeying a rule when selecting options in HSPnet. It made my selections void, and disqualified me from entering a re-draw for the students who were left without an option.\n\nFor anyone whose currently in the program, or is thinking of attending: read everything and attend everything. Even the bottom of standard emails, **even if you feel like it's one you received every year - read it**. I'm a model student whose always followed rules, participated and never missed a single class. I have a respectable GPA, have always strove to be a leader in my clinicals, and have helped students understand nursing concepts. Now after missing a single rule, I feel like I've derailed everything and feel as though all my work went to nothing. I'm going to be in a void for the next 4 months watching my peers pass me by. I've reached out to coordinators, asking if this rule could be overlooked and if I could enter the re-draw, but the placement officers insist the rule I missed doesn't seem to be amendable (The rule was that I had to chose: 1 community + 1 Long-Term Care + 8 hospitals. I chose 10 hospitals).  Just know that rules are rules, and the only thing you can do as a student is try to make sure you're always on top of them. I feel like death, like there's a gaping hole in my stomach and you do not want to feel the way I feel now.",

They're placing us waaaay into Burlington LTC homes and like wtf.....toronto to Burlington..NO THANKS! it seems like they really do not care about our concerns and bothers...they just wave it away and blame it on COVID...so I guess COVID doesn't exist in Burlington?! it's just really annoying....does it get better?",

                    "comment": "tbh of all my years I haven't had an issue other than this one. I did miss one of my clinical rotations (Obstetrics) b/c they didn't have enough options for everyone. They instead gave me second community placement (horrible), but other than that everything was fine. This year really opened my eyes to how much they could lack empathy though lol. I've always heard stories, but this was the first time I felt it first hand. My email basically was me giving my life situation: had an unexpected child during covid, wasn't able to receive CERB or EI or any funding while not being able to work b/c if I did I wouldn't have been able to see my child (COVID put my family in a messed up situation and I'm a LTC PSW, so), worked right after school as much as I could, which led to me missing that meeting - and therefore miss that rule. I actually put the word 'begging' in my email, asking if I could pls be included in the re-draw.\n\nThe reply: The rule is you have to select 1 LTC + 1 Community + 8 Hospital placements. You are not allowed to enter the re-draw.\n\nAt least a litttle emotion in the rejection would've been nice lol. My fault for missing rule at the bottom line of the email I guess\n\nNgl tho, if the rule was really that important that it could completely void out my whole semester w/o chance, you would expect them to place it somewhere w/ emphasis and not in the bottom of an email that gets sent out every year w/o change. Fuck dude, we learn about how financial and social situations influence people's lives and how patients should be looked at holistically, and to not treat patients on a single axis b/c they're multidimensional.  it's so ironic getting burned from a nursing program that preaches empathy and holistic perspective, especially in such a difficult time for everyone",

Especially the dean and program administers, they say they're the best and provide students with the best opportunities but they do the bear minimum. They made it seem like it was such a huge accomplishment that they got us placements for this year, but in reality like that's your job??? Hope everything works out for you!

Hoping this is not too personal of a question (feel free to message me privately about this): I'm considering accepting my offer into the 2nd-entry program, and I'm wondering how you were able to manage the program with pregnancy/a newborn. Was the school flexible with your pregnancy (apart from your terrible experience above)? Were you able to take time off? Were you able to balance pregnancy with school? I ask these because I would be returning to school as a mature student, and I'm trying to figure out if I would be able to balance this program with family planning.",

                    "comment": "Hey! So I am actually the father of the child, so I wasn't pregnant during the school, but we had a rocky pregnancy. She had Vasa Previa so my partner would bleed often, and it would typically be during the night at 2-4AM. I would have to drive her to the hospital and be a necessary support system. Luckily, school was online, so I was able to be fairly mobile without sacrificing too much other than my focus. It was difficult. Balancing that with school was tough but I was able to do, but I credit that to being able to study efficiently. I'm a high GPA (A- range) student who has never got a C in my nursing school career. Honestly, I don't think the majority of students would be able to handle it, seeing that I know many students who were free of hard obligation that failed the semester. Even adding the layer of work on top of school is tough for many, but I know SOME students who are able to handle that. Not a lot though, and many of those who tried, failed. For perspective, I was able to work around 24 hours a week on average, depending on the semester in my first 3 and a half years of school.\n\nI don't think Humber is flexible at all to be honest. I've never had to bargain anything other than aforementioned experience, but I think my experience says a lot about the exception handling process of Humber. I think many students feel the same way. Also you can freely take a year off, but I know for the 4 year stream you have to finish the program within 6 years. Idk how long the bridging program's cap is. \n\nThis is not to say Humber is bad. I loved the students there, the non-nursing teachers were ALWAYS amazing. We have one of the highest passing rates, if not, the highest Toronto College-University NCLEX passing rate on a first-try basis. Typically, in clinicals, whenever I was mixed with another school's nurse, I was ALWAYS surprised about how little the other person knew, both in knowledge base and in practical skill. Many nursing students I talked to wish they went to Humber.",

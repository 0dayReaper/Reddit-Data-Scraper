Though there\u2019s a 10% chance that one might get through with financial aid as well but I won\u2019t recommend it. I\u2019ll say take a study loan if it\u2019s essential for you to go abroad to make your life, not just studies. Also humber is not cheap, go for a little cheaper but reliable institutions.",

It will be difficult to do well in the program without attending at least a most of your classes. \n\nTry and look for a job that starts in the evening. That\u2019s what I did and I was able to attend all my classes.",

Just know that some courses are heavy and understand your priorities. Working can be done but if working is essential to you, you should think of doing the part time program if it\u2019s still offered.\n\nEdit: all clinical classes and health assessment are mandatory attendance (when I was in the program)",

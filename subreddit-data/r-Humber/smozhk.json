    "postText": "Hi Im starting a four year program at Humber this coming fall for their Lakeshore campus. I live in Mississauga and was wondering if its even feasible to commute there everyday. I dont drive so it would really be a long commute. Has anyone tried this or know anyone who commutes to Lakeshore everyday from Mississauga?\n\nIf not I was also thinking of just moving into residencyy for like the most basic plan or possibly find a place to share w a roomate near the school. I am not getting OSAP and would want the boarding fees to be as cheap as possible around 800 at most every month? Is this even possible? What are the prices like? And how does one go about finding places to live? Are there any groups or apps I should know about that make this easier? \n\nWhat would be the wisest choice in my situation? Thank you so much for any infor or help. Just really lost on this whole college thing.",

However, the &lt;900 places are shared house accommodations. It's not bad, a little unusual at first but a great experience.\n\nhttps://www.places4students.com/Places/PropertyListings?SchoolID=UFZancm%2bWWA%3d \n\nThis website is how I found my place directly opposite Humber for 900. There's a few 800 to 700 up now. There might be more listings up after the Winter semester ends, but that's not guaranteed. \n\nAlternatively, you could try Facebook or Kijiji. Check for landlords who are willing to rent to students on those sites. Not all do, because students have become known to break the lease and move elsewhere for cheaper rents. Just be careful with scams and go with a friend to check out places.",

I took a bus from home to the airport and another from the airport to Kipling subway and #44 and that take me right at Humber lakeshore so I took 3 transport to and from school daily. So it\u2019s manageable",

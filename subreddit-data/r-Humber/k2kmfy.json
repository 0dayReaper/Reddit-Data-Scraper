I'm doing another program now, Human-Centred Design, at Algonquin college which I started this fall. \n\nBut I was able to successfully land a co-op, and as far as I know everyone in my class was able to do so. Some are still in the process of completing their co-op and a few have already found full time roles. So, I don't think landing a co-op placement or a job was very challenging. It all comes down to your individual skill and the effort you put in. One thing that I did note though, is that the process of finding a job took a decent amount of time so it's always better to start applying as early as you can.",

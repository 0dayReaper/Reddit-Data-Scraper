They might consider your transcripts for interim decision, but at the end of the day they want to see institution - institution communication. This prevents fraud and weeds out unqualified applicants.\n\nNot sure if affiliated entity is considered acceptable but to be safe just make a request with your alma mater.",

It would be WES in my case sending my evaluation report to Humber directly after my university sent my docs to them. \n\nBut I\u2019m not sure about the backlog summary since no institution or university in my home country offers something like this, if it was required I\u2019d have to make them type, sign and send it to either Humber directly via email or I\u2019d have to email Humber with a uni/institution issued one.\n\nNot much could be found on search either so just posted this so somebody who\u2019s gone through the process could share some points!",

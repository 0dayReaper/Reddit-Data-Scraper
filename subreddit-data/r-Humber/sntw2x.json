    "postText": "I have a master's degree in math and I want to apply for a 2 year computer programming diploma. But most people tell me that I won't have much chance for getting the visa for a program of that level, and that I should apply for a PG diploma first and then change my program. Can I wait on a visa/study permit for a PG diploma and keep my seat in the other program at the same time? Would I have to pay the tuition of both programs in advance, for that purpose? Is the transfer procedure simple?",

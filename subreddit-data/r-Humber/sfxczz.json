Everytime I try to click on the login button so that I can find out info about my tuition and stuff, the page doesn't load. It registers the click, but the page doesn't change at all. I don't even know if this is a question I should be asking here, but I honestly don't know who else to ask\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

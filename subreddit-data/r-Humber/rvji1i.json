I\u2019m currently in Pre-health and just applied for the BScN in fall 2022. \n\nAll I know is you need at least a 75% overall average with no lower than a 75% in each course. I\u2019ve been told that most applicants that get above this cut off get in, but that always changes based on the applicant pool.",

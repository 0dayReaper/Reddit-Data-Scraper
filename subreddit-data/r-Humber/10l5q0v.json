    "postText": "Hello, I'm a high-school student in my last year looking to apply to the Comedy Writing and Performance program at Humber Lakeshore.\n\nOne of the (potential) requirements is a Comic Writing Sample, I'm likely going to do a short story for it but I'm a little confused about the wording. When it says short story, does it literally mean a short story? Can it be any topic? I don't want to write a 400-1000 short story only to have done it wrong in some way.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Email is probably best. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned over the years is that the people reading want your story to be good and will appreciate your willing to learn on how to be good then just winging it.",

If you can put together a 4000 word short story, that would be pretty much on-par with what they\u2019re looking for, in my experience (I did the playwriting program at the National Theatre School of Canada).",

    "postText": "Hi guys. I'm a mature student applicant, and will be 25 for the 2023/2024 school year. I am wondering if it's normal for mature students to live in residence. For any current students living in residence, do you know of any older students on your floor? I'm just trying to figure out my living situation for next year.\n\nThanks so much in advance.",

I would personally say it doesn't matter what is considered normal or not, it's more important that you find a living situation that is functional and comfortable for you. Even if there's any students that think it's \"weird\" that someone your age is living there, that's entirely your choice to make and none of their business.   \n\n\nHope this helps!",

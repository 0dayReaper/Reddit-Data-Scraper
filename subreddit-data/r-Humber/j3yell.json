    "postText": "  \n\nTo preface this post, I want to say that I just graduated from an honors program and made deans list every year of the 4-year program(not as a brag, just to show that I am not a slacker by any means). \n\nWhen I was first looking into this program, I was not really daunted by the 7 course per term set up, I thought it would be a challenge, but a manageable one. Boy was I wrong. I would like to say that this is my experience as someone in the program recently (so everything was online, and I cannot say how big of a difference this program is from one medium to another). Also, this is just on the first term.  \n\nSo first off, none of the professors are in contact with one another, meaning all assignments and midterms are all clustered, so you will have 5-6 assignments/midterms in one week. This is the same for exams, you have class up until the exam week (no break) and every exam is in their class time, so this means you will have 7 exams in the span of 4 days (Tuesday-Friday). If this sounds really overwhelming, it is. The program coordinator was emailed about this, and his copy/pasted response was essentially \u201ctoo bad, so sad\u201d. Which was great. \n\nAnother issue is that all assignments are reliant on McGill legal citation, as this citation form is mainly used practically in law firms and whatnot it isn\u2019t super likely you have been taught it in your undergrad (I was not). So, you would expect that they would teach you how to do this form of citation. There are two classes that say they teach you this, Legal Research and Legal Writing Skills. Kenneth from Legal research literally gave us a tip sheet and that was that he did not explain it in class at all and kept stating that the prof from legal writing would teach it. We had two assignments due on the 15th-16th that required legal citation and the schedule for it to be taught in Legal Writing was on the 23rd.  Which clearly does not work. Multiple students asked the professors who the assignments were for to teach us it, and they both kept saying that \u201cthis prof teaches you that, just look it up\u201d and other things like that. For some reason they all seemed determined to not teach us this crucial skill. \n\nYou have an incredible amount of material to cover in a short time, all of the professors say that \u201cthe LSO says we must cover everything\u201d and then they all proceed to be behind schedule. Most of the professors are okay though, they just have a hard time staying on topic and getting things done in the schedule. However, the Paralegal Career Development professor is incredibly unprofessional. She puts YouTube videos/ podcasts on then leaves the room to make food. She basically does not teach anything, and just has you watch videos all class, its an easy class, but its very frustrating that you are paying to watch free YouTube videos and listen to podcasts.   \n\nOverall, all of my fellow students and I have been extremely stressed out every week. It is in part due to the level of workload, which is fair for an accelerated program, but mainly due to the unprofessional conduct of the staff who either just did not teach us how to do things to accomplish assignments or who fell behind and made us do the extra work to cover it. I have personally never been this stressed in my entire life. I know many other students who have quite literally burst into tears from being overwhelmed by this course. I figured since there are no posts on this, that I would share the intensity so future students can be properly prepared.",

            "comment": "Not the same program, but very similar. It was not accelerated and only two years but I took the Law Clerk program and recently graduated with honours. I have a full time job and drove there from Mississauga every day. This is to give you an idea of what my circumstances are and how this program was for me. \n\nI found it a little stressful but not unmanageable. Last semester was online for me. It was much easier to work in person instead of at home but it helped that I had a group of friends who I could ask for help. If you are finding the first semester difficult, which is very likely due to the online method, it does NOT get easier. It gets a lot more intense very quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, Kenneth Vigeant is just a terrible professor. I had him for Litigation I and he barely taught us anything. I managed to pass his class and took Litigation II and was surprised at how much easier this class was. It\u2019s all because of his teaching. \n\nAlso yes, the professors do not coordinate with one another which can be frustrating but at the end of the day, you will be in a workplace where not everyone communicates with each other and you may be confused. The onus is on you to collect information and ask questions. This is from real life experience. \n\nI cannot speak for the other professors other than Kenneth being terrible, but bring it up to his superior as he is the program coordinator and you will have to go above him to complain. I didn\u2019t have any other issues with the rest of the professors but Paralegal although similar, has different professors. If a professor is completely not teaching you, make a complaint. You are paying for a service and deserve to get your monies worth.",

When I was looking into this program and others there was very little content aside from the carefully crafted advertisements from the colleges to view. I was not prepared for what the program is actually like. I think it is important for people to know what they are getting into. \n\nI have learned a decent amount already, but these are the frustrating and stressful aspects that my classmates and I have been struggling with (unprofessional profs, cluster assignments/midterms, falling behind schedule, not being taught crucial things). \n\nI've just never been in a program where they say \"You must use this on all assignments\" but then the 1 class that teaches you how to do it in doesnt schedule it until middle of the term after things have already been due. \n\nThanks for your response tho!",

Assignments and exams are scheduled depending on the course not the program so often there will be over lapping days or weeks (same as highschool).\nAdditionally in legal writing mcgill is the only citation that matters but there are numerous guides on how to use it as well as a fairly inexpensive book called the mcgill guide so i would suggest looking there. Also humber libraries i think has legal citation information. \nBut yeah the cramming sounds like my experience with education be it at highschool, Conestoga college, humber, or my friend's experiences at other universities and colleges. I 100% endorse the program coordinator saying suck it up, in university its not uncommon to write 3 or 4 exams in one day. Welcome to the big leagues I guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nEdit: can confirm tho profs are god awful at staying on topic or on schedules and more than a couple have had professionalism issues",

                    "comment": "Aha yeah. Well, I am also used to studying for multiple exams and midterms, it would just be nice if the professors would actually teach us the things we need to study. Most of my classmates do not know what will be tested because the professors just go off on tangents for 90% of the class. \n\nI'm aware that McGill is the citation we need to learn, what I think is ridiculous is that no one is willing to teach us it. We have legitimately asked multiple professors including the professor supposed to teach us how to do it, and none of them will. If you are going to give you students an assignment, one that if you fail to do citation properly you could be brought up on academic misconduct, then the professors should be doing their job and teaching you the skills necessary to be successful. That is not asking much. Especially since, this program is supposed to be open to those without a law background, as long as you have a high GPA and a 4-year degree, so it is fair to assume that we do not know how to do it. It isn't 'welcoming us to the big leagues' to be shitty at teaching. That's just laziness and them being bad teachers. \n\nForgive me for thinking that I was paying to be taught how to do crucial skills in this program, clearly, I am paying to teach myself.",

Regarding the 7 course per term set up, is it possible to take fewer courses like in uni? Also, what made you choose Humber instead of George Brown or Seneca for the paralegal program? TIA!",

Since it\u2019s accelerated you cannot drop any courses, you must take the full 7 and if you fail any of them you will have to wait to complete the course you failed before taking Any of the next semester courses, which makes sense but is kinda a bummer. I chose Humber because a person advertising Humber at my uni told me the field placement was paid-which it is not. I basically ended up sticking with it due to the location (which didn\u2019t matter since it\u2019s online now) and the tuition costs (which were decently low). Hope that helped!",

This means that there are two premade schedules and you choose one of them. You do not get to curate your schedules like you're probably used to from university. Most classes meet for 2 hours and 40 minutes once a week (some classes are a bit shorter but not by much). Depending on your commute and your schedule, you may have to stay on campus for multiple classes. Some days you might only have one class, and other days you may have a three-hour gap in between.\n\nWith the number of classes and amount of material, it's honestly a full-time job, I can only manage to work a few shifts at my part-time job per week and even that is pushing it sometimes. Make sure you're online to register as soon as it opens to guarantee securing the better schedule of the two available",

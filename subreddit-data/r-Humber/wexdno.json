I'm interested in Humber's UX Design Certificate but I want to know the delivery of the classes for Fall 2022 (which are in-person, online, or hybrid). I don't have a MyHumber account so I can't check for myself (unless someone knows a way I can check?)   \n\n\nTIA! :)",

A PM would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude05\n\nAlso, how has the course been for you? I heard it's inclined heavily towards research and not so much on the UI stuff.",

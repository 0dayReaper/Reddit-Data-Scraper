    "postText": "Hello guys, I was just posting this because I had a question as to what is meant by this in the Blackboard submission ? I submitted an assignment 1 week after its original due date, still not pass the 2 week drop deadline, does this mean the professor won't be grading it? I submitted two times and both times, this message popped up. I would love to hear some feedback, as to what happens in this situation?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o925nepppava1.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbef208db0b7689f53fa4c66f7798f3f147869fa",

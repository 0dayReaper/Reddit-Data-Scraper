Like need to take some courses of python, java, sql, ML prior . Otherwise it will be tough. Also for him, the career support team has been disappointing as its been months that they didnt replied back to his mail. Marking for some business subjects is not very pleasant. But maybe the experience would be different once in person classes will start. I am not able to connect with anyone else, so guys please let me know if you recieve any feedback.",

The job market is initially tough but once you get your first break its an easy ladder to climb. Experience isn\u2019t necessary as they dont consider outside experience much.

I liked the idea of having both business analytics and machine learning in one place as most post-grad certificates don't integrate both here. However, the program advisor Natalia Korchagina does NOT care about students. She blames students for not understanding her class BUS5100 only because she created it. There are a ton of group projects in the first semester and even though some students are \"mature\" or recent graduates you literally only have 5 people that you can trust to be productive. I've made this Reddit just to complain about the program because I know students who have threatened to kill themselves in hopes that maybe if the program had blood on their hands they would finally take students' request and opinions seriously. Instead, they just suggest students that truly want to be there go to a different program, when in reality it doesn't need to be as difficult as it is. Also, the career center person, Kayla Carter was very difficult to get a hold of and you still have to find your own employment despite them saying it's a co-op. Lots of favoritism in the program so you need to brown nose and address that you have no concerns even if you're dying inside. Don't expect to get along with your classmates because they all see you as competition for no good reason. This course is better than a bootcamp if you're a domestic student paying $12,000 instead of $15K to $20K but be warned, it is not a quick and easy way to get a job in data analytics, business analytics or anything in the data industry. If you want a short and easier program and you have existing programming experience Centennial, Seneca and George Brown are better. If you have no programming experience this program is the best BUT you have to suffer in silence, pretend to enjoy the presence of others, have a supportive home/family/friends and not have any mental illnesses because no one cares about you while you're doing this heavy and intensive program.",

Lots of people crying, getting angry, and considering other schools. No consideration for international students especially also no compassion from the program coordinator Nataliya, she enjoys watching students in pain.",

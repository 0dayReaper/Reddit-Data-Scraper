    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nHoping ti get clarification, I will be extending for summer (final sem) and currently working my job. \nI know we have to stop working once cog/final grades are issued (correct)? \n\nI intend to apply for pgwp. Do you guys know if I'd have to stop working at my current job and wait? \n\nWhat is the tineline? Are both issued at once? Can I download them immediately so I can apply? \n\n\nTldr: is it possible to keep my job, get my documents and apply to pgwp without having my job be interrupted?",

I was offered to pay as soon as my college ended at my internship but I had to request them to hold for 2 weeks. I took a break from my part-time too. \n\nI raised a request at Humber to expedite my certificates. I got everything done in less than 2 weeks. I hope this helps :)",

Okay so I meant last exam of your final semester and you don\u2019t have to go to college again for your course. \n\nI\u2019ve collected COG, kept other documents ready to apply for WP. Once I\u2019ve received Applied Status document, that\u2019s when I got back to work. You are not supposed to work until you receive applied status WP after your last day of college.",

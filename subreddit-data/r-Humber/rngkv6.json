    "postText": "Did anyone take Quantitative Research Methods? \n\nIs it a difficult class? I took stats at the college level, and really struggled to get a mid 70s mark. Is it possible to get this mark mark to count as a transfer credit for the degree level Quantitative Research Methods course? I get anxious just thinking about doing more statistics",

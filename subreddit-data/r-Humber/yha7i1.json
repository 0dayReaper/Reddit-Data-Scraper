    "postText": "Hello All\n\nI have a question about international student admission at **Mohawk**. One of my friends was admitted to Mohawk recently, in the first week of October to be exact.\n\nHe paid the fees to the college and began the loan application upon receiving the Offer letter for **January Intake**.\u00a0 This week, he received another email from Mohawk informing him that his admission had been moved to the **May intake**.\u00a0When he called the college, he found that this happened because they had to move the students from September intake to January intake.\u00a0 After calling and requesting the college (Mohawk), he found that they may still grant him admission in the January intake if his visa is stamped by the end of December, which might happen but is not certain.\n\nMeanwhile, he applied to Humber College and was accepted for the **May Intake**.\n\nThe question he has now is. If he submits the Student Visa Application in the name of Mohawk, would it be transferable to Humber if he is not admitted to Mohawk for the January intake? Or\u00a0 Should he apply again after paying the Humber fees?",

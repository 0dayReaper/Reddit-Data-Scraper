If you have background knowledge in math, biology and chemistry you should be fine. for bscn I believe you need a 75 average to be considered but double check on the program website. Prehealth is good if you haven\u2019t had any post secondary experience. Also you may want to think about taking the admission test for practical nursing just in case your average isn\u2019t as high. Hope this helps",

It gets tough because there are so many more small assignments and tests that some find hard to juggle. \n\nI\u2019m currently in pre-health going into the BScN (hopefully). You need at minimum a 75% with no lower than 75% in the core courses. However admissions is rank based so even if you do meet the min. average, it\u2019s not guaranteed. I also believe that there are a guaranteed number of spots in the nursing programs reserved for pre-health students so it\u2019s a great pathway towards those degrees.",

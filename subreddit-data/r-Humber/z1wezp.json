    "postText": "Hello Im doing the humber test on november 28 2022. I just have a few questions to those who did do the test. Will marks be given to you? Do I need a calculator for the chem portion. What marks do I need to be considered for admission. What kind of chem and bio questions will there be (is it more like equations using boyles formula or more general questions like properties of metals). I was going through reddit and I saw that U/ **Syantic** made quizlets for both bio and chem. I've been reviewing them and found it easy. However what kind of topics/questions could I see on the test. If anyone can help me please do your best.",

I think it\u2019s pretty basic stuff all around.  They don\u2019t tell you your mark either unless you email them to ask.",

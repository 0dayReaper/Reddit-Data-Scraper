I am currently finishing year 2 and starting to think about pre grad placements....can any of the older and wiser future nurses give me some wisdom!? :) \n\n\\- what happens if you don't like the placement you are placed in? (I would personally be so miserable if I was placed in geriatric setting because it makes me so upset)...my dream is the NICU or peds! \n\n\\- how does it work? is it site selector process? Can you ask them to switch your placement???",

            "comment": "Hey so I lived on residence last fall so it might be slightly different bc COVID was still full swing. \n\nSo for ur room, definitely bring a mini fridge. The caf closes quite early so it's always good to store food/drinks, especially if u tend to eat later. \nSome kind of covering for the mattress is not a bad idea, I haven't heard of problems with the mattress but other college aged people have used it so..\nRAs were nice, they don't really care too much and aren't looking to get u in trouble as they are students too but it's also their job so don't vape right in front of their face bc it puts them in a weird position. It depends tho on the RA, that was my experience tho. \n\nIf u are in a single room, some kind of shower shoes are definitely a good idea as even tho they clean the showers pretty much everyday it's still kinda gross. Also some kind of robe or covering to use to and from the shower. \n\nCafeteria has some options, if u are a vegetarian/vegan/gf it might be a little more difficult for food options tho. Certain areas are only open at certain times (or maybe that was a COVID thing?) But the like main grill part with burgers and stuff will be ur best friend. It's the most consistent, they don't run out of their food and it's open majority of the time. \n\nDepending on how much u typically eat and what size ur meal plan is u might wanna do a general budget. Cafeteria food is expensive and it's annoying bc ull either end up with no money and 2 weeks left or like a shit ton of money and u leave in 2 days. If you have I think over $100 left tho I believe they refund it. I can't remember what the exact minimum is tho but u should check.\n\nAlso this is optional but I wish I had brought a Brita/water filter. There isn't a lot of water bottle filling stations and plastic water bottles from the cafeteria is expensive so I was drinking a lot of tap water. I am not used to the water there ig and it was fucking with my system.\n\nIf you aren't used to using public transit, it's worth taking a look into. If u want to go out or anything Ull have to bus, there's not much around Etobicoke.\n\nThat's all I can think of rn but feel free to message me if u have any questions. Ull have an RA assigned to ur floor if u need anything, or ask any RA tbh. Just Try to participate and attend social events, clean up after urself in common places and also don't walk in the arboretum at night alone",

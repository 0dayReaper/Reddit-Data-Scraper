I\u2019ve noticed the bachelor of science in nursing programs requires a 60%, also other schools that offer RPN require a 60-65%. \nAny info would be greatly appreciated \u263a\ufe0f",

I moved to Toronto recently, and was curious if they\u2019d take my final grade for that course as a transfer credit. \nThanks",

    "postText": "Hello!!\n\nHumber college offers a 2 year diploma in computer programming. Is the program focused on one language only? I hear that similar programs in some other colleges offer a little bit of everything, therefore at the end you find out that you haven't learned enough, that you are not advanced in one language or profession and it's not good for finding relevant jobs. What do you think?\n\nThanks!",

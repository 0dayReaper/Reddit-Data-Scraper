    "postText": "Maybe it's the location of the school but it is obviously a commuter campus where people seem to just show up to classes and go home. Group projects feel like pulling teeth to get people to meet up since no one wants to commute. Somedays it feels like high school with people running around. There is no seating anywhere and the school seems to be cramming more people in.\n\nGrowth is good but unchecked growth is frustrating. Same goes for UofGH where there was a literal report stating overcrowding and the admin brushed it off like no big deal",

    "postText": "Hey everybody,\n\nI'm looking into going for the post-graduate HR certification program here at Humber and have some questions regarding the program.\n\n1. The program is one year, how hard are the courses and the workload, I see that you have to take 6 courses per semester? (note: I work part-time and would like to continue working while enrolled in this program)\n2. I see there is a co-op term which is one of the main reasons why I'm pursuing this program. Do you have to find the placements yourself or does the school help you with that as well.\n3. After graduating from the program how successful were you in finding an entry-level position.\n\nThanks for anyone that replies, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated :)",

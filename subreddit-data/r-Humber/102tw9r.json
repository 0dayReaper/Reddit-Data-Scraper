I went there a single time for a holiday event while it was still open and there was hardly anybody there. I didn't stay long because I had other plans. Most people preferred to hang out there during the day while the bar was closed. What's weird to me is that it wasn't open the last time I checked. I know the pandemic isn't over, but they've already opened so much other stuff back up.",

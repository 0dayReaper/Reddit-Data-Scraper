Depending on if you also reported income and if you claimed any other school related expenses like rent, transportation, textbooks etc, you will receive a tax refund.",

You can pull now.*\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.\n\n*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",

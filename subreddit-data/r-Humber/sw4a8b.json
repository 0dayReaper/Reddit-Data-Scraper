    "postText": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm an international student and have been accepted into the Public Relations graduate certificate program for Sept 2022.\n\nI paid the first semester fees through Flywire as directed. However, i have not received any confirmation from Humber directly stating that I'm now confirmed as a student of the college.\n\nI received a receipt from Flywire itself stating my payment has been received by Humber, but I'm really nervous about not receiving any communication from Humber stating that I'm now a student of the college.\n\nI also don't see a receipt on the MyHumber portal either, or any other record stating that my spot is confirmed/I'm admitted to the program.\n\nIs the Flywire payment considered the actual confirmation of securing a seat?\n\n I reached out to them but received a cookie cutter response starting that the Flywire receipt is all I will receive and they don't separately provide a receipt. They didn't address whether I'm now considered a full-time student.",

It can take 24 hours for this payment to reflect on your Humber account. \n\nThis is all a long way of saying that by paying for your term you have secured you spot in the program. Once registration opens in the summer you will then be able to enroll in your classes. They will not consider you a full-time student until the course begins in Fall 2022 and you are enrolled in courses.",

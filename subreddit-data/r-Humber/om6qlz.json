I've heard they exel in it's art and anination programs so I'm not too sure if their CP program is any good.",

Would you say it requires good math skills or would getting low 70s in math but high robotics/computer programming marks be acceptable to get it? The program seems very interesting and I hit the requirements on paper so I'm currently trying to see if it's a good fit!",

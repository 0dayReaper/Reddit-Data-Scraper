    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI withdrew from 2 classes this semester and need to take them before the spring - I'm just wondering about the cost since I can't seem to find any resources outlining it for me. A classmate said something about some kind of reduced price? (as in not another 1800$ \"semester\" for my program)\n\nIf it is just paying for another semester then I can deal with that - but paying a 250$ deposit and having no idea what it's going towards isn't something I'm keen on doing.\n\nAny help or insight would be appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Business Management, first year - if that matters)",

            "comment": "It's not a reduced cost, it's less than a full semester cause you're taking fewer courses. Also remember to check if the course you want is offered during the Summer, if your program doesn't usually run that time. The 250$ goes towards paying for the courses you registered for.",

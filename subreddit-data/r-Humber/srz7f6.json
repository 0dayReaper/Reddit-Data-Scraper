    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nI\u2019m 26 years old and looking to make a career change.\n\nI originally went to school for poli sci but my real interests and passions lie in photography/video/graphic design\u2026 which sounds perfect for the media communications program at Humber.\n\nI would like to work in the music industry at some point doing visual content or working with brands and artists.\n\nI would even love to work in the e-commerce space with different fashion or clothing brands. Shooting and marketing their products.\n\nBut until I get to that point I would be content in media production roles for other brands in other industries. \n\nI want to be a creative director for brands and artists.\n\nRight now I\u2019m an experienced photographer but I want to expand my creative skills to make myself more employable. I\u2019ve dabbled in a couple video freelance projects as well.\n\nEventually I could take myself freelance and build my own business but I just want the skills to get my foot in the door and earn a stable income working for a brand or company until then.\n\n\nGoing back to school for me kind of feels like a big deal\u2026 so I just want to know is this program worth the time and cost?\n\nTLDR; is media communications worth it? Can I get a job as a visual content creator for brands? Did this program help you get a job? What kind of jobs am I realistically looking at after finishing this program? I don\u2019t want to take on more debt or go back to school and struggle to find a job after.",

                            "comment": "North is hard to get to on public transit from Burlington. Driving can also be hard, especially around rush hour. My sister thought that she was in for a 45 minute to 1 hour commute each way, but some days it takes her over 2 hours. She says to avoid 8am classes if you can, as the traffic to get to those is unpredictable. Trying to drive home between about 4 and 5 can also be pretty bad, but at least you don't have to worry about being late for class. Trying to drive home on late Friday afternoon can also be really stressful. \n\nAlso, be aware that the North parking garage can be an absolute madhouse at times (usually right before 8am, and right after the last afternoon class ends).",

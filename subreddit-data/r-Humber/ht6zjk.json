    "postText": "I'm a recent enough grad from one of the many arts programs at Humber. I graduated in 2019, and I LOVED my time there. Because I actually went there. These classes are HEAVILY based on in person lessons and workshops that in NO WAY be substituted for with an online environment. Admin is barely with the times in a regular situation. I once spent half a lesson waiting for a professor to figure out a Skype call while the entire class waited around unsure of what to do. Don't get me wrong: these courses are amazing and I loved my time there, but unless admin figures out some magical way to halt a pandemic, maybe wait until 2021 or see if you can defer. Nobody would blame you.\n\nThis is just my experience though! I would love to hear from other arts grads to see what you all think.",

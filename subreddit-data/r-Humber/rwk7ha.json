But it shows that the program has been waitlisted for international students. What does that mean?\nAlso, considering that the Covid-19 scenario worsens, will the program be converted online? If so, does Canada provide visa even if the program is online? \nAny inputs will help!",

She or he will have the accurate information and it is part of their job to speak with you. \n\nWhile the Reddit community is usually very helpful, there is a risk that you would receive inaccurate/out-of-date information.",

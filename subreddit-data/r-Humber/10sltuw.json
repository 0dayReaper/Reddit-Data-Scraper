    "postText": "Hello!\n\nIs there anyone who is taking this program or has completed it?\nI applied to this program because you take the accelerated nursing prereqs in the first semester (preparatory). \n\nHowever I\u2019m a little bit scared to move into this program. If you get below 75% in any of the courses you have to start over and try again for the next year?\n\nIs the prep semester hard? And do a lot of people pass it to get into the actual program?\n\nAny insight would be helpful!",

            "comment": "Hi, I recently got a conditional offer for this program and looking forward to connect with other ppl starting in 2023. I was wondering the same thing however one of my friends who graduated in 2019 told me the semester wasn\u2019t difficult as long as you stay on top of the materials and keep all the deadlines in mind as they are pretty strict with those. Overall the course load wasn\u2019t all that bad and the professors were pretty nice (according to my friend) and made sure students were well prepared for any exams. Are you taking all 6 prep courses ?",

I\u2019m just scared to risk other offers for other programs I applied to this year if they make it super hard. I\u2019m so nervous! \nLet\u2019s stay connected!",

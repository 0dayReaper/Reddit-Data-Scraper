    "postText": "Hey I'm currently going to start college soon for the first time and as expected I am nervous, scared, and genuinely terrified of it all. I don't know what to expect and i see so much stuff online about how in college you will have no time to spend with friends and do stuff you enjoy because you'll constantly be busy with work. I'm going to start electrical techniques program and was wondering if anyone who did this course or anyone who has experience with college how was their first year like and is it like I think it is in terms of being constantly working and having little time to spend with friends and family.",

You will have plenty of free time in between classes, you can choose to spend that studying but I find it pretty easy to have fun with friends and family as well. This includes my daily 5pm-10pm job on top of that.\n\nFirst couple of weeks you're gonna be stressed trying to figure things out but it will all be ok in no time! Have fun",

Just like everyone else I like doing stuff I enjoy and was scared I wouldn't have time to do it. Being an 18 (M) straight out of high school I just enjoy playing sports, video games and hanging out with friends.",

As long as you're passionate and use your available resources you'll do fine.  A lot of game programming specifically is people helping eachother out I find",

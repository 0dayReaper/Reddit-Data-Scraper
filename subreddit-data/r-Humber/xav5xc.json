The first part of the commute isn't too bad despite the crazy amount of trucks on the road now, but jesus christ driving around the campus itself is what's a mission for me. I swear no one knows how to fucking drive.",

Fuck this, atleast my programs only 8 months but idk how ill survive 8 months of this. The $12 a day fare doesn't help either.",

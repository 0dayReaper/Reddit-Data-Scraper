            "comment": "It is a tricky question -- it is right at Bloor and Yonge so the rents are quite expensive. \n\nHowever, it is also right at the intersection of the two major subway lines so if you can find a place near any subway station, the transit ride won't be bad --  it will be a 2 minute walk to school from Yonge/Bloor.",

There are also Facebook groups related to shared housing and student housing. \n\nBe careful about scams...never send money in advance. Insist on seeing the apartment first. \n\nI would also check with Humber College housing and the IGS staff for advice.",

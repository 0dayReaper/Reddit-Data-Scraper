    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI wanted to make a post about my experience in the Addictions and Mental Health (ADMH) program offered at Humber as I have gotten a few messages from people interested in applying or who have applied. I too remember searching for information when I was curious about applying and hope this post helps. \n\n A bit of background about me is that I am currently doing my MSW and completed the ADMH program in June 2022. I had previous work and volunteer experience in social services/ mental health prior to the ADMH program.\n\nI ended up taking this program after finishing my undergrad and feeling that I would not be competitive enough for graduate school. I liked the idea of a 1-year course that offered a co-op and felt it would help boost my graduate school application. \n\nCourse Load: The first semester I believe had about 6 or 7 courses. It sounds like a lot but it was a mix of online quizzes and weekly reflections. As I took the course when COVID restrictions were still in effect some classes were strickly online while the counselling class for example was in person. There is a mix of individual work through essays and group presentations, as well as demonstrations for the counseling class. In my opinion, the course load was manageable for someone like myself who was also working part-time and relatively easy.\n\nInstructors: Were amazing. Most of the instructors are social workers and brought their real-world experiences to class. I learned so much from them and I encourage prospective students to get to know the profs as they can sometimes be references for you.  Some profs really value participation or grade you on attendance so make sure to review the syllabus. \n\nOne of the biggest questions I get is about the co-op placement. \n\nFor my cohort, we were left on our own to secure our placements as the placement advisor ended up leaving in the middle of the semester. We found out that in previous years, students got a booklet with organizations looking for students and received much more assistance with finding placements. Despite this, every student found their own placement. We were told if you couldn't secure a placement you could do a large research project instead but this was the last resort. \n\nThe placements are unpaid unless you are doing one at your place of employment. To have your place of employment be your placement your role must cover the competencies required of the ADMH program. I personally did not want to rely on OSAP only so I looked for a job in January that was related to social services, interviewed and got the job. I then told my supervisor I wanted to do my placement at the job and was able to have a paid placement. \n\nMost people ended up doing placements at places like Jean Tweed, CMHA, Progress Place, homeless shelters and the Salvation Army. Many of my classmates ended up getting hired at these same placements after graduation.\n\nI would recommend this program to anyone who finished undergrad and is interested in going into mental health/social services. It provides a great mix of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. I will say that while the course claims to cover addictions we spent more time on mental health.\n\nApologies for the lengthy post but I hope this helps!",

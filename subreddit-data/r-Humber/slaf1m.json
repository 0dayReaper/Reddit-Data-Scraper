I'm in my final year of bachelor's of commerce degree and I'm just a month away from giving my semester end exam, I wanted to apply for diploma in Global business management program (September 2022 intake) so can I do that ? I mean I'm still a student so will Humber accept my application ? And what else documents will I have to submit. Thanks in advance :)",

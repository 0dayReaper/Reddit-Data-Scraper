It says on the Govt. website that the course duration should be of 8 months minimum and the institute should be on the DLI list to be eligible for PGWP. This course ticks both the requirements to be eligible for a PGWP. But, when I enquired with the college they say that it is doubtful and they cannot say for sure.\n\nAnd I am planning to do 2 courses of 1 year each which should make me eligible for 3 years of PGWP",

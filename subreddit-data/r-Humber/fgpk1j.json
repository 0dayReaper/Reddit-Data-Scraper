            "comment": "I think it's a good college for students with specialized programs or who leave nearby. The major cons that come to mind are: \n\n1/North campus-overcrowded and confusing as fuck. You walk 10 ft and you're in a new building. Don't even get me started on parking. \n2/Lakeshore-nothing, it's a gorgeous campus. I studied there for a bit and loved the scenery. There aren't as many initiatives that take place here but they still have guest speakers and resources available (see pro 1).\n3/In my experience, instructors do not want to deal with international students plagiarizing and cheating. Very disheartening and frustrating for students who study their asses off, just to watch other students swapping scantrons in the back of the room. Despicable. Edit: I've also heard this same story with Seneca. It's a bigger issue, not just about Humber.\n\nPros:\n1/Very inclusive, very \"student\" focused (or how it seems). North constantly has events going on and there's a lot of resources for students (food, academics, assistance, even a pharmacy machine available!)\n2/Lots of programs with work placement integrated---this is extremely important as having a Degree or Diploma doesn't mean shit nowadays. You need the practical experience before graduating to give you that competitive advantage. \n3/Tuition is reasonable--compared to going to a prestigious university in the GTA, when you can get a degree/diploma with work experience for a fraction of the cost.",

            "comment": "Taking Business Administration- Accounting at North.\n\nPrograms good, great even, compared to the other schools I've been to. Program coordinator is actually involved if you reach out and most professors (for the full-time classes at least) are pretty good and are available.\n\nThe actual campus though? It's shit. It's horrible. I thought last year was bad, this year is ridiculous with overcrowding. I need accessible parking and can't do stairs, I'm consistently late to class since each building has 1 elevator that doesn't always work. Parking is an overpriced nightmare. You're better of showing up for class and going home, and if you want to use common areas to study the LRC in the middle of the night is the only time you'll actually be able to spread out and focus.\n\nAll in all, I do enjoy it though. The campus can be disheartening but the program I find is good and there's a lot of resources for students if you know how to look for them.",

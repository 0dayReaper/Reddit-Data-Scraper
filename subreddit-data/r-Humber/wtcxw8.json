    "postText": "Interesting title right? \n\nI was taking Business Administration in the fall of 2020 after graduating High School. I took three semesters back to back to back and by Summer 2021 I was suffering burnout from the program. I had dropped a course each semester and this time I had failed and dropped like 3. But the courses aren't difficult, in fact they are incredibly easy...too easy.\n\nThe classmates I had were all cheating, every whatsapp group on every test and exam. I realized something, not only were the majority of my classmates Indian but they were foreign students from India. (Just to make it clear no hate to Indians, yall are awesome hell majority of my best friends in life have been Indian.) I didn't want to continue doing a program I was paying $2000 a semester for something students are doing to easily pass and get student Visas and stay in Canada. It just felt pretty humiliating to be in a program that seemed so worthless, even the majority of the students taking it don't care about it. Yeah, I probably could've finished it by now and pay 12k for a \"advanced diploma\" and be one of the highly esteemed college-educated of Canada but honestly, unless it's a university, Business is worthless at college.",

Makes it feel worthless to people who actually care and put the work in.",

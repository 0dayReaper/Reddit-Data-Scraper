You may have to contact the coordinator of the program you're interested in, or at the very least call you the registrar and ask. I think you'll be okay though. Just make sure you talk to someone to confirm!   \n  \nI completed a diploma at Humber before the post-grad. The coordinator of my diploma program spoke to the coordinator of the post-grad and I was accepted with a conditional offer because I was still finishing the diploma at the time.",

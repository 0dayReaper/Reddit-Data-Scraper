    "postText": "Hey guys, the last time I went to Humber was around 5 years ago now and I used to carpool with a buddy and pay for the daily parking (which was hell trying to find a spot late in the mornings). Now that I'm going by myself, I have to think about the parking situation come this Fall. \n\nSo, does anyone have any experience buying a parking permit? How long do they usually sell out from the time it's online? When do they typically go on sale (date/time)?  Do you have to buy a Fall and Winter semester parking permit separately? What's the parking situation like for that new parking garage, is that just for daily parking as well?\n\nGive me all the parking info you guys have as that seems like the biggest challenge in actually going to college lol.",

            "comment": "I forget when it goes on sale, maybe late spring/early summer? I waited until late august to buy mine which was cutting it really close, they sold out like a week or two later I think which would have screwed me over if I waited any longer.\n\nYou can buy fall/winter permits together which will run you almost $600 which sucks but is better than the daily parking at least. Idk anything about the parking garage but the parking permit is for lot 13 (near the first entrance after the lights) and 1. The buying process itself is easy enough I guess, you'll have enough time but just don't wait months.\n\nDriving around the campus does suck though lol. A lot of people drive like idiots because they either just started driving or are just douchebags. The parking lots need an app to access as well and it doesn't work half the time for me so it's kind of a pain in the ass. I love having to pull out my phone and unlock it while driving, such a genius idea.",

            "comment": "For north they sell fall &amp; winter passes together so you have to pay like $700 for the 1 pass that lasts all year. Not sure of the exact date but I think it may go on sale in July? Make sure to double check bc parking permits sell our fast. You could get the off campus parking which is cheaper + they have shuttle buses. As for the parking garage, not 100% sure, but I think you could get parking passes for that too bc they have the scanner at the gate.",

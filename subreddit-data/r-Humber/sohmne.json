Humber has some okay programs, but graphic design is underfunded and your first year will be the same classes as Journalism and communications students.\n\n\nSource: did one year of that program, was very dissatisfied",

Advertising Graphic Design, Advertising and Marketing Communications, Journalism, Public Relations, and Media Communications all share the same first semester with common foundational courses. \n  \nIt's designed to allow students to pivot to either program for semester 2 if they feel they chose the wrong path.  \n  \nI know a few people that started in Advertising and Marketing Communications and pivoted to PR and AdGraph. All of them are currently working in the Industry.",

It\u2019s flexible and creates a space where a certain kind of student can thrive.\n\nWhen I was looking at programs I didn\u2019t want anything long. I wanted something that let me do what I wanted to do. I had zero design knowledge going in and I was hired before graduation.",

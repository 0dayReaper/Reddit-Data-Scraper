You need to have Bluetooth on, according to the person I spoke to and then click the door icon on the top right when by the gate and it should appear for you to connect to, allowing the gate to open without a ticket.\n\nShe also said not to have the phone connected to your car when attempting to do this.\n\nLet me know if this worked for you because I start tomorrow and will need to be doing this as well.",

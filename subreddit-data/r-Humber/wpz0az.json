Seems worth it rather than risk going another year waiting and possibly not getting accepted.  You do 6 sources for 2 semesters and I know they\u2019ve been able to do some transfer credits for the degree program so it\u2019s not just a total waste of a year too.",

I wouldn\u2019t think that a 50 in chem would be an acceptable grade to get into prehealth but I don\u2019t even know if they have minimum grades.  But honestly if you want to go into anything else medical\u2026RPN RN or anything you need to either get into and do well in prehealth or go to an adult high school and upgrade that because you aren\u2019t getting into either RPN or RN with that grade.\n\nBut to more directly answer your question\u2026.I doubt it.  Even if it were the SAME content as 12 chem\u2026..you already got a 50 so do you think you could get a 75 taking it again?  And that\u2019s assuming it\u2019s the same content and I very much doubt it is, I imagine it\u2019s harder so doing better will also be harder.\n\nAlso depends on why you got the 50 too really.  If you had shit happening if you just didn\u2019t try etc but are willing to change all that, I suppose it\u2019s possible.  If you really really tried and just couldn\u2019t manage it, then that\u2019s a different story",

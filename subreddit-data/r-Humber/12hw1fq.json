Perfect for new graduates, limited experience, or those re-entering the job market. The event is free and you can get your ticket on EventBrite! I know some of us have exams around that time but I think it will be a great opportunity.\n\nEVENTBRITE LINK TO JOB FAIR :\u00a0\n\n[https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/593425982087](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/593425982087)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eph1axx6f4ta1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec95705bfd8c55ec46bda7f8c57ee3569d80e256\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aw8ushm4f4ta1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f74ddbc5a1bed3e72ddd993f1bc97097225aa9e9",

Did you have to repeat clinical hours from previous years or were you able to get the hours/ course transferred over?\nHow much longer did it take you to graduate?\nAlso wondering if Humber asks nursing students to complete weekly reflections for clinical \ud83d\ude05.",

At my current school we do them weekly. For others it isn't as often if not at all, which gives you a bit of a break with the constant readings / assignments.",

I am in Humber\u2019s 4 year BScN program now. A lot of my classes were too old to be transferred. However, I was lucky enough to have a bunch of electives transferred over which made a huge difference on my workload. It might be difficult/tricky to transfer over the core nursing classes. Might be possible though! Good luck.",

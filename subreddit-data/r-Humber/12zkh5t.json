    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m a graduating university student and I got accepted to Seneca and Humber for their law clerk programs but still don\u2019t know which campus to go to (I\u2019m also reasonably close to both colleges). I was wondering how you felt the classes helped in preparing you for a job, how you felt about the structuring of classes (I was browsing syllabi and was quite shocked at how much tests were weighed), how knowledgeable/supportive/flexible were the professors, how fair you felt grading was, if you were supported during your co-op placement hunt and how organized you felt the professors/program was. I was also wondering how much flexibility you have in choosing your professors/class times since I\u2019m used to being able to cater my timetable to my needs. Any other insights into the program or any advice transitioning from university to college would be much appreciated!\n\nI have a couple more general questions that don\u2019t really involve the law clerk programs: I\u2019m with accessibility services (for mental health reasons) with my current school, so the quality of health services/accessibility services is really important to me too. To anyone who received services from either: how was the process of getting set up with accessibility services? How was the quality of counselors at your college? How was the wait time for their services? \n\nI would also appreciate it if you date your experiences (e.g. if you graduated recently or in 2012)!",

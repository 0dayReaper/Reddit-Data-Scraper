    "postText": "I got an email last week sometime telling me about the new date for paying the balance of tuition fees.\n\n\nIt's says that now we have to pay the balance of tuition before we register for classes so this means we have to pay it by July 21 instead of late September. Idk if it's just me but I don't think that's really fair especially if we rely on OSAP. \n\n\nLike I'm just confused about this whole thing, does it mean Humber students are gonna get their OSAP money early?? Because if not, idk what I'm gonna do. \n\n\nI looked around at other colleges and their deadlines to see if they changed theirs but nope, it's just Humber who changed.\n\n\nI see nobody else here is talking about it so idk if it's just me being slow &amp; not understanding.",

I'd recommend even shooting off an email to their general inquiry address just to initiate a conversation thread. but yeah, have no idea how it's going to work. same fears as you :-/",

Therefore, for the Fall 2021 term, the tuition balance is due on Wednesday, July 21, 2021 prior to registration\u201d\n\nNote the \u201cto pay or have ARRANGED to pay\u201d.\n\nThen further down it includes the following \u201cTuition payments can be arranged by:\n\nPaying your semester fees in full by the due dates;\nApplying to and being approved for OSAP; or \nArranging a payment plan\u201d\n\nSo basically they have to know you have the money or will have the money before that date and applying for and being accepted for OSAP is one of the accepted options.",

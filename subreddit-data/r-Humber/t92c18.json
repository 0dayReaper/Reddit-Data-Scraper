    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! Hopefully a future Humber student here! I applied on mar 1st to BComm - Human Resources Management &amp; Bhs - Workplace Health and Wellness (+ an additional advanced entry application) and I was wondering if anyone here are in these programs? How do y\u2019all like it? My top choice is HR but if I don\u2019t get accepted into that, I\u2019d be able to bridge into the WHW. Any info or experiences regarding these programs will be greatly appreciated:) hope to see y\u2019all on campus one day!",

    "postText": " Humber has been going back and forth with their decisions about keeping us online or in person as the last official announcement stated that all classes will revert to in person on March 6th, 2022. This on-again-off again situation creates instability and poses a significant strain on students and faculty alike. Bringing students back to campus, then delaying return multiple times, means many students need to make significant adjustments to work and living arrangements to meet attendance requirements. All while managing the challenges of online learning, the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning has been challenging to all. However, at this point, at least for the remainder of the winter term, it is the most fair, flexible and equitable option for students, especially those in their final semester on their programs. We urge Humber to do the responsible thing and keep students online.  I have attached a link to this petition which you can sign to show support of keeping the Winter 2022 semester online. \n\n\n[petition](https://www.change.org/p/humber-college-keep-humber-classes-online-for-the-remainder-of-the-winter-2022-term?redirect=false)",

I have no issues with learning in person, I signed the petition and passed it to others because I\u2019m more worried about students contracting COVID. Since I\u2019ve had a professor from Humber (I\u2019ve had one tell us exactly this at the end of last semester and since then no update so im going based on that) let me know that if we do go back, it\u2019s at full capacity in the classrooms, which means essentially no social distancing which is not safe. Even with masks, full capacity puts a lot of people at risk of contracting it. Atleast with the option to stay online, those who don\u2019t want to risk their health can stay at home and complete their courses. No one should be forced to stay or forced to go, we should be given the option if we want to go or stay online due to this risk it has to our health. Nice to know that caring for my other fellow students means I\u2019m selfish \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",

Which means it can still be passed on with the full capacity classrooms. \n\n2) someone can contract it from elsewhere and unknowingly pass it on to those within the class. \n\n3) there are people who started their programs in-person but found out they learn better online after the pandemic had kicked in with at-home learning. \n\n4) lol no we haven\u2019t known \u201call semester\u201d as their decisions have been off and on since we were supposed to be online start of the semester no matter what and then it was shifted to a later time dependent on the cases and etc at the time. So someone who\u2019s worried about COVID has no excuse as to why they can\u2019t do in-person? Oh lol I\u2019ll go tell my immunocompromised friends that they better go in-person and have to without giving any excuses. I registered for in-person learning but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to risk my health and safety. \n\n4) Humber isn\u2019t giving us the option to stay home, they\u2019re pushing for in-person for all courses which is not beneficial for all, the same way you state online is not beneficial for all. There are a significant number of professors who do not record or stream lectures when they are held in-person, even at the request of students there are some who won\u2019t budge at all. \n\nYou can call me selfish and to an extent I can agree with you because obviously every individual wants what\u2019s best for them to happen. But going back to in-person does negative impact a lot of students and you can discount their experiences just because there are other students who would do better that way, the same way you\u2019re claiming that I should advocate for online learning since there are other students who don\u2019t do good that way. What Humber should do is give us the option so we can do what is best for us, but they haven\u2019t. So it\u2019s not wrong for either side to advocate for what they feel is best for them and their fellow students.",

Not completely non existent sure, but again it was announced in NOVEMBER that they were planning on being in person this semester so if covid is seriously the concern for people they had ample time to defer\u2026\n\n3. Same argument for those who find they learn better online, they should have the opportunity to continue to after the rest of us go in person - they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to burn everyone else because they learn better online. \n\n4. It was a month before the semester started Humber announced they were going to be going in person this semester. After that it was 4 weeks notice before the date (they said the 1st two weeks online with two weeks notice) and then we were given 6 weeks of notice before the new date of March 7th. what do you mean we haven\u2019t known all semester? Whether immunocompromised or not everyone still had ample notice? On top of that you keep trying to deflect my points as i don\u2019t care about those who don\u2019t want to be in person, when no they should have that opportunity while not at the expense of us in person. \n\n5. ABSOLUTELY THE ISSUE - humber needs to FORCE the live-streaming or recording of the classes for those students. THATS the equitable solution. It shouldn\u2019t have to be a request. If you were arguing for them to be recorded or streamed absolutely i\u2019m signing it and sharing it with everyone i know - instead the petition is to cause a different group to suffer as you claim it\u2019s fair or equitable. \n\nabsolutely i agree with the last part, there needs to be a legitimate online option for students as well as in person, sadly that\u2019s not what this petition is pushing for though.",

The emails and notifications from Humber, I was told in November that there was no guarantee that we would be going online and we would receive a full update at a later time. Around Christmas time is when I got an email saying we were doing full in person and no hybrid. Planning isn\u2019t the same as being sure, they were also planning on having us in person last semester for a majority of courses but could barely do one per semester in person. plus Humber has now started taking the semester fees earlier like around the time we register for courses compared to previously when we could pay after we\u2019ve done a week or so of the semester. So some feel obligated to stay as they\u2019ve already paid for the semester without getting a full notice from Humber about what\u2019s going on. \n\nNo one should suffer due to the circumstances another student needs. The petition is directed at Humber to make changes so that all students can have what\u2019s best for them. The students who need online should be Abel to do online and the students who need in person learning should be able to access in person learning. No one should be forced to stay online or do in person if it\u2019s not what is best for them. \n\nYour comments do appear as you don\u2019t care for those who don\u2019t want to do in person learning. As much as you don\u2019t want to admit it, I\u2019m not the only one that can be viewed as selfish here with my views. \n\n100% Humber needs to be accommodating so that students are getting the proper education no matter the option they pick. But once they make us go in person, we lose the opportunity to have recorded and streamed lectures which make it difficult for those who do get sick or need to stay home for safety purposes. The petition doesn\u2019t put that across but I believe it should, because the only way Humber will even implement these things and push professors to record is if we bring it to their attention. All I\u2019m asking Humber for and something I hope others will ask for as well is the the option to choose what works best for us, whether it\u2019s in person learning or at home online learning. No one should be forced, an option should be provided",

I see that now, after we\u2019ve had this long discussion that we both just want for each student to have access to what works best for them which is online for some and in person for others.  \n\nDefinitely the petition should tackle that both options should be readily available for students, that we should be given the choice rather than forced into any decision. Yeah we agree on alot, just was alot more defensive (atleast on my side) because I\u2019ve had quite a few people message me directly stating I\u2019m selfish when my only thing was wanting to keep others safe so is started off a little.. mean with my words. I do understand what you mean there, the wording of the petition and the few who do speak out about it make it appear that it\u2019s only one way which does leave a lot of students out and leads to the argument losing its standing. \n\nOverall, I just hope Humber hears us and tried to make accommodations so that we can have online or in person available to students who need it. Maybe doing a a hybrid semester? I hope for the same, that we all stay safe and healthy, and that we are all able to succeed",

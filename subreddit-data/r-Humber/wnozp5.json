    "postText": "Hi bit of a Cheeky question here, I'm still halfway through my program and haven't yet graduated but it's currently summer and I am not enrolled in any classes until the fall. I frequently go to campus just to hang out in the clean spaces and use my laptop. \n\nDuring summer I am aware that the student ID number doesn't work if you try to sign in on the computers or connect to the non-guest wifi. But besides that, I can still connect to the guest wifi right now and still go to the gym and such since I still have my ID card.\n\nMy question is:\n\n1) How far can I push my luck here, what services could I use during the summer and/or after grad?\n\n2) Will these benefits ever end considering it's basically a free gym membership until I lose my student ID?\n\nP.s, please don't think I'm trying to scam the school because I definitely paid and will continue to pay for my program, and just don't want to miss out on something if it's available!",

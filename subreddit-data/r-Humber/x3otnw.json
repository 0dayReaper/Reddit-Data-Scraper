We we're really only convenience friends for projects and classes if that makes sense, I noticed it was like that a lot with others too where they knew each other at the school but no one stayed to hang out and just left to go back to highschool friend groups or groups outside the college.  \n\n\nI think eventually you'll see more familiar faces as class times go on and working with assorted people you'll meet some. Best of luck",

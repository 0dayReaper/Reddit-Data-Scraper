    "postText": "What are the degree programs like at Humber College? Are they structured more like college courses where the majority of learning is done in the classroom, and sometimes as part of a group? Or is it a lot of Independent learning/reading alone from a textbook?\n\nAre the degree classes structured more towards theory? Or are they structured the same way the diploma or advanced diploma course would be structured (but more difficult), meaning there are a lot of in class assignments that actually teach you industry-specific skills? I'm looking to get out of my communications degree, and enroll in public relations or advertising for September.\n\nI want to get a degree, but I don't like the way my university is structured. Most of my classes are lecture-based, and there's very little actual in class participation. I know colleges are supposed to be more geared towards hands on learning.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit of both it\u2019s like an advanced diploma/ a degree. Mine is an honours bachelor so it\u2019s a lot of work which can be overwhelming. I do believe that it may be easier than university just because it can be hands on at times. Keep in mind there\u2019s lots of essays, group work and journals etc. I got my diploma and I am doing my degree and I can tell you it is much harder, more time consuming and a heavier work load. It is great though and I do recommend you to go for it ! Keep in mind a lot of the profs work at universities as well! Hope this helps :)",

                    "comment": "Honestly I'm not scared about the difficulty, it's just what I'm studying right now seems so far removed from what I want to learn. \n\nI'm in a communications degree, but it's so general that I worry I'll have a hard time getting jobs. Basically all I do is sit in very long lectures, and write essays; I looked at the syllabus and that's pretty much all I do for 4 years, and all the courses I take are so general that I won't be a specialist in anything. I'm interested in doing Public Relations(basically a communications degree with actual career prospects), UX design, or advertising at Humber since they aren't very math intensive and actually prepare you for careers when you graduate. That's what I really like about Polytechnic institutions, that you become a specialist.\n\nI'm also hoping that the year I spent in university vote count towards my general electives.",

You want to leave university to go to college for the same program or something similar pretty much! I believe the public relations course is a diploma not a degree but look into it ! You most likely can apply your credits to humber you just do a credit transfer. I\u2019m not too sure how it works though if your electives can be applied automatically or they have to be similar to the ones that are at humber. If you have any other questions feel free to pm me",

Depending on which courses you take I found that there are a lot of independent assignments (I.e essays, reflections, or journals) compared to group work or group assignments .  There is a lot of independent learning and reading.  But since some class sizes are small It\u2019s easy to get help from your professor if needed.",

            "comment": "Great question! I'm looking at Humber College for either Film and Television Production \"Advanced Diploma\" or Film and Media Production \"Bachelors Degree\". Looking at the program courses and descriptions, the Advanced Diploma sounds way more practical, hands-on, etc. than the Bachelors (a bit more theoretical maybe?). The Advanced Diploma is 3 years (vs 4) and costs about half the price. I'm interested in Screenwriting and the Advanced Diploma has a lot more Screenwriting courses too. Do people \"look down on\" advanced diplomas vs degrees? If that's going to be a problem, would an Advanced Diploma + a \"Masters\" be a good option?\n\nJust had another look at the Humber site and there's an interesting two-semester  \"Ontario Graduate Certificate\" in Television Writing and Producing. Seems like a Masters, including the cost! ($10000, vs $3700/yr for the Advanced Diploma). In 2 semesters there are 8 very specific writing courses (TV comedy, Improv, etc.). \n\nHaven't been able to find any comments online from people who've done the courses.",

Everyone is welcome to attend, but especially students in the GTA!\n\nThey'll be having some super cool Toronto bands playing and ALL revenue from the ticket sales will be going to an amazing charity called the Lambda Foundation. \n\nTickets are now on sale for only $10, but make sure to get them before they sell out! Support this great cause while having an amazing night out! \n\nThis is a great way to celebrate Valentine's day week, the start to reading week and/or just to have fun discovering some new music while meeting new people. Even better, you'll be doing this all while contributing to a great cause!\n\nReserve your spot now before it all sells out here: https://www.showclix.com/event/jam-out",

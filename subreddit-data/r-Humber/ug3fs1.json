    "postText": "Hey, \nWill be joining Humber this September, but I'll have to attend an important family function back in my country sometime in December. So do students get any calendar with all the exam dates, and everything and can anyone share it with me? The academic calendar given on the website is very generic and useless.\n\nThanks in advance\nWeb Development program",

Typically for a degree program an exam would take place in the last week before the last day of class. And for exams before mid term grades are due they usually take place before reading week.  ( this may apply to non degree programs as well)",

If you are going to a wedding and need a long weekend, that is doable but if it is a week-long event and/or if your country requires a couple days travel time, you might consider starting a semester later.\n\nIn any case, check in with your program coordinator on Monday and ask her or him to give you advice -- make sure you know your travel dates so that they can better advise you.",

There hasn\u2019t really been a straight up reason given, but speculation is because they want the money confirmed due to protest to online classes etc. Many students are angry and said they weren\u2019t gonna pay their tuition in full if it was online again, so this may be their way of ensuring that can\u2019t happen, because those students will be barred from registering",

I know it\u2019s a big concern for many- especially because it hasn\u2019t been confirmed by OSAP if they\u2019ll pay it by July.. so some people may need to pay out of pocket and wait to be reimbursed by OSAP. Honestly a pretty shitty situation and I hope the college has better reasons than this speculation",

If you are approved you don\u2019t need to pay anything and will be able to register regardless of when your OSAP funding applies.  I can\u2019t speak to the why of it but from what I can see it\u2019s not the hugest deal regardless of how you are going to fund your schooling.  I would encourage people to really read their emails before making huge decisions that will affect them long term such as quitting for a semester etc.",

I will be paying my balance in full when it pops up and not using any assistance so I didn\u2019t read the payment plan email they sent out (I saw it and skimmed it but I guess missed the part about how you don\u2019t need to pay in full before July). My bad!!",

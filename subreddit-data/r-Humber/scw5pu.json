    "postText": "Hi! I'm a transfer applicant (been out of school for 5 years) and just recently got accepted into this program. I've applied to other colleges and Seneca has been my top choice until today when I received my acceptance package from Guelph-Humber. I was wondering if any recent or past graduates of the program would be able to answer some of my questions here or even through DM would be great:\n\nSince my degree back then is completely different (bachelor of interior design from Ryerson), my hope was to do 2 years of college to get a diploma and transfer to complete a bachelor's degree in social work. That would be another two years, essentially the same amount of time with Guelph-Humber.\n\n1. Would anyone be able to tell me the main difference in getting Guelph-Humber's Honours Bachelor of Applied Science vs. Bachelor of Social Work if you were in the same boat in making your decisions?\n2. Colleges offer two placements in total and less workload overall I feel, but with Guelph-Humber, you also get placements starting your second year. What was that experience like and were you able to choose yourself or do you get placed somewhere without a choice?\n3. I may decide to pursue a Masters in the future and I've seen on the page that it's still a pathway with this degree + diploma. Anyone have any experience in furthering their studies ie. U of T?\n\nThe deadline to accept for me is **February 7th** so any advice and help would be much appreciated!",

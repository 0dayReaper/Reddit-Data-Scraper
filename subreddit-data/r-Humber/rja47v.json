It's the deadline to apply if you want equal consideration for programs starting in Fall 2022. And May 1, 2022 is the deadline to confirm an offer.\n\nI'm guessing you'll get an offer some time this month or next month.",

I put my application this past October for September 2022 intake and I haven't heard anything yet.\n\nI did speak to admissions last month and they said it takes them a while to review everything on slideroom and the FD Questionnaire. Even on myhumber it's still showing that I'm missing requirements but they've confirmed they have them via email.... I don't know if that's reassuring or not, but sounds like we're in the same boat at least! Unless we get early acceptance I think we'll be waiting until February for some answers. Good luck!",

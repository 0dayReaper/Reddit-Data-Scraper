I just want to be realistic with myself in seeing if I can receive an offer!\n\n\\- When did you guys apply?\n\n\\- When did you guys get your offer?\n\n\\- If you\u2019re comfortable sharing, what was your GPA for the last 60 credits?\n\nThank you, I really appreciate it!",

I graduated from YorkU in 2019 and finished with a 3.0 CGPA. \n\nHowever, the admissions advisor calculated it and didn\u2019t meet their requirements. Then I had to re-take my grade 12 biology course on TVO ILC and finished it in middle of January 2022 (earned a 88%). But there\u2019s nothing I could have done to meet \u201ctheir requirements\u201d. It\u2019s not like I can go back to YorkU and fix a grade for one or two courses. The PR (Practical Nursing) program is chaotic enough lol \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThey have an all disclosure requirement so any education you had done in the past, they require to see it or you\u2019re automatically rejected.\n\nThe 2nd entry competition cut off is 80% or higher which is kind of ridiculous considering 74% is their minimum CGPA requirements. But meeting minimum CGPA doesn\u2019t guarantee admission offer.",

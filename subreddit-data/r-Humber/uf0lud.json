I decided there would be hardly a point *for me personally* to continue - even if I was passionate about it. I still enjoy helping &amp; caring for others but I think the rpn program taught me that my strengths may lean more towards the administrative side of healthcare/business &amp; I figured that, hey, even tho I can\u2019t bridge into this program &amp; I\u2019m literally starting all over - the rpn diploma might give me a lil boost if I were to apply for an HR position in a healthcare setting:)",

TBH I haven\u2019t considered non-bedside roles purely because like, not only am I not passionate about it but I\u2019m also not smart enough for it. My profs &amp; clinical supervisors have always said I got the work ethic and the grades for it, but I\u2019m honestly barely keeping my head afloat. To name a few examples: I don\u2019t sleep well or for long, I get great grades on my assignments - but I test horribly, and honestly I don\u2019t think I could do nursing at a university level - but that\u2019s what u gotta do if u wanna make more than just above minimum wage. My cumulative GPA now in my 5th and final semester is a 3.7 and even if that did get me into bridging - why would I pay thousands and thousands of $$$$ just to fail? (cause I honestly believe I would) What semester are you in? I hate to say it to someone already in the program cause I hated hearing it too but I always tell people if you have ANY serious doubts at all - don\u2019t do it. Save yourself the money, time, breakdowns, and wrinkles because it\u2019s not worth it if you aren\u2019t passionate about it. Like man, here I am in my graduating semester finally admitting this isn\u2019t what I wanna do. I\u2019m sorry if any of this has scared you, I really am, but I\u2019d hate for someone to go through my situation. Definitely message me if u ever wanna talk about it!",

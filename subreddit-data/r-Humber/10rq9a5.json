    "postText": "In 2021, my cousin applied to a Humber degree program but due to some personal issues he wasn't able to attend after signing up for courses. What he did was he withdrew his offer on OntarioColleges and not through the Humber site as well. Now collections is asking for the fees for the semester that he thought he withdrew from.\n\nHe emailed Humber and a Petition for Late Withdrawal form for them to review. Has anyone had any experience with this form and will my cousin have to pay out of pocket for the semester that he thought he withdrew from?",

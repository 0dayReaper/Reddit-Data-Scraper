I can\u2019t really find reviews or reputations on KPU(Kwantlen Polytechnic University )\nIs revit important to find a job? \nDoes anyone know if those schools teach revit or not?\n\nI want to choose a program that offers coop  opportunities",

            "comment": "Coming from the Landscape design/Technician program at Hunber and landing an Architectural Designer position at an Architecture firm, Id say Humber is really good for trades. I cant speak on behalf of the other schools but I learned Autocad extensively enough to help me with my current position. \n\nRevit is good or bad depending on the industry. Architectural Technology can cover many industries. I wasnt taught Revit in my program but being a student at Humber allowed me to download it for free and I taught myself. It ended up being useless for the landscaping industry but it was still fun to learn. \n\nI didn't have any CO-OP options but Humber actively gives you jobs opportunities throughout the year either on campus or through connections. \n\nSo I reccomend Humber, but keep doing your research! Hope this helps.",

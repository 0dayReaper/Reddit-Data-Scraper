            "comment": "first thing you should do is talk to your professor on that course and ask if there is still a chance for you to pass the course. perhaps you can retake an assignment or re-submit a task. if this is not possible ask the prof if it is their advice that you drop it. Because if you drop the course early, it will not show in your transcript. our english professor said it was wiser to drop than have a failed mark show on the transcript. she said it casually in class so it's not a big deal, professor deal with it all the time.",

So I guess as long as I do not have a 50% by the final transcript (final grades) should I still be able to pass that class? I am doing really well in all of my other classes, its just this one :(. But thank you so much for the advice and help I was literally losing my fucking mind.",

Before making that decision, speak to the prof and/or the program coordinator. Do not be embarrassed -- it is their job to guide you.",

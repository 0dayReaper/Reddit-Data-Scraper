    "postText": "Hi! \nI recently accepted my offer to the Humber 2nd Entry Nursing Program starting in Sept. 2022. I had a few questions regarding the curriculum, so that I have an idea of what to expect. \n\n1. Do you have to \u201cbuy\u201d all the textbooks for this program? Is an e-textbook acceptable? \n\n2. What are the main textbooks for this program, from someone who is in the program or has been in the program? (Ie. the textbook for NURS 2133) \n\n3. For semester 1, which is the preparatory semester, will these courses be offered online or in person? (I completed 3 of 5 courses from prior University credits, so I think I would only have to complete 2 courses if I\u2019m not mistaken).\n\n4. Are there any other recommendations in regards to the program you may have?\n\nThank you! \nPS. If anyone else is starting this program at the same time as myself let me know :)",

I hope I help you out by answering some of these questions.\n\n1.No you dont have to buy all of the textbooks, most of them are online. I mostly use the e-book.\n\n2. When you begin the program, you start with the prep semester. I can give you some of the textbooks we used, but they've changed the curriciulum from when I started.\n\n3. The courses are entirely in person now for Sept. If your applying to transfer your credits, there a form you have to fill out and submit before a deadline, so make sure you look into that very soon and submit the application, because the program is very inflexible around deadlines. (Its best to contact the school or a program officer/administrator and they'll tell you where to find it)\n\nIm sharing resources with students starting the program that I meet here so feel free to reach out!",

            "comment": "Congrats! I also got into this program and accepted my offer about a month ago. Now that colleges can do their own RN programs, Humber has broken away from UNB. I don't know how much the nursing curriculum will change but there will be changes to the preparatory semester courses. From what I heard there will now be six prep courses instead of five (human anatomy and physiology, clinical microbiology, pathophysiology 1, ethics and moral theory, lifespan development, and statistics). Since we are the first cohort to go through this \"new program\" I am not sure how much the advice of current students will apply to us but hopefully other new students have some insight to offer!",

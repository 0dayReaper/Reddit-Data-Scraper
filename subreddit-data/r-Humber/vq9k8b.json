I am a bit confused between the two.\n\nIt would be of great help if anyone can share their experiences in any of the two courses/colleges.\n\nThanks! :)",

The UXD program is online and unorganized. Two professors don't even show up and just email us to see recorded lectures on our own. Those teachers are not serious at all. I feel like I am wasting money.",

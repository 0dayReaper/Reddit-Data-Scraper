I was wondering if the diploma is the same as the master's program at Humber because both are for four semesters and I couldn't find any master's programs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally,  I would love to get some more information on the college in terms of education and post-graduation job prospects.",

Education is mostly mediocre but varies by actual program.\n\nIf your goals are more academic you want to look for a public university in Canada.",

To get a Master's, you first need an Hons Bachelor , get a high and competitive CGPA or last 2 years depending on the school and then apply. An Hons degree is a 4 year degree. Many graduate schools will require that you do an Hons and a thesis. You will compete with hundreds of other qualified students for a spot. There are usually only 20 spots or less.",

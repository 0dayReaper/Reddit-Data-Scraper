    "postText": "This program is a mess it's all over the place and it completely falls flat on its face in the promise that you will be ready for a front end developer job. The only reason I find myself even remotely employable is because I put in 100s of hours of self learning over the course of the program. We spent multiple classes learning one off technologies like AR spark creator whatever the fuck rather than reinforcing design or development skills. \n\nIf you're interested at all in web dev just take the programming course and learn more JS and react on the side.",

I only got a job after graduation because I was already a freelance illustrator prior to entering the program. MMDD is like an exploration program where you get a taste of everything but you\u2019ll have to develop the skills on your own if you actually want to be good at something.",

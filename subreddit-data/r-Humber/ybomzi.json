Not available yet could be the same as no decision, since they probably haven\u2019t even started reviewing applications yet. If you want a better idea of when you\u2019ll find out, email the program coordinator and they can usually give you a rough idea. I got my acceptances from Humber at the beginning of May for programs that started in September.",

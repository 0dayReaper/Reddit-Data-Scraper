Understand that you will struggle and ask for help when you do. Humber has many resources, USE THEM! \n\nThe biggest tip I can offer is take time for self care! It\u2019s super important you learn this now as a student nurse because as you develop your nursing practice and start working, you will need to take care of yourself first before you care for patients.",

            "comment": "Like u/666persephone999 said, keep up with your readings. Read and reread your course outlines and critical paths. \n\nAt the beginning of every semester, I put all my readings, along with when they need to be read by, as well as assignment due dates and any other important dates into Microsoft To Do, one list per course. Keeps everything organized when you\u2019re juggling 6 courses. It\u2019s easy to fall behind in readings. Message me if you\u2019d like a screenshot.\n\nAlso, attend all your classes, especially A&amp;P (class and labs) and nursing. You\u2019ll learn so much easier and won\u2019t be touching the material on your own for the first time.",

I regret going to humber college because there just wasn't a community feel, the program (business) was okay but I feel unprepared for the workforce. The student union made it hard to have clubs and there were not many events imo.\n\nDoes anyone else regret going to Humner College?",

I'm sure it's not the same, but I hope that it at least is somewhat useful to people that are also feeling a lack of community.   \n\n\nI feel the college itself is very disconnected from their students.",

There are numerous profs in my program that are just downright incompetent and are clearly just there for the paycheque. The school itself is seemingly under eternal construction, the \"student\" union has no idea what in the hell they're doing, there's no community, no sense of connection to the school. Their slogan is \"We got you,\" but in reality, they're leaving out part of that sentence. We've come to learn that it's actually \"We got your money.\" The school could care less about the students and their success, they only care about padding their bottom line with our hard earned money. Shit is constantly broken at that school and never fixed until someone complains, and even then the fix is half assed at best. Also the way they've handled the whole covid situation is brutal. Minimal communication at best about their plans moving forward, though we should be used to minimal communication from the school by now. In summation of this far too long comment, fuck humber. /rant",

Mostly because of the reputation that I heard from other nurses about how graduates from Humber were the best performing overall when it came to where they graduated from. Plus, I had an easy transit compared to the other options that I had. In addition, I know that Humber loves to advertise that they're the only nursing program with access to cadaver labs (in addition to your regular anatomy and simulation labs); and I can say those cadaver labs are really helpful.\n\n2. I'm a 1st year, so unfortunately I don't really have a good knowledge about that. I do know that you can get placements in the Trillium family of hospitals (Credit Valley, Mississauga, Queensway), as well as in Etobicoke general - but other than that I'd just assume that you should be able to get placements in Peel, North York, and Toronto.\n\n3. You do, but each semester has a different theme to my understanding as a 1st year. In the first semester you don't have any placements to worry about, but you start doing placements in the second semester. Second semester involves long term care, and then following semesters could involve hospital work in psychology, hospice, ObGyn, etc.\n\n4. Humber is a commuter school, and the student union has a reputation of being difficult to work with for the clubs - but at least they do hold events. There are online communities that you can join (Humbergang on Instagram, the Humber discord, etc). As for the nursing program, check Facebook for groups that pop up for the 2020-2024 group of nurses, and I got lucky that my year wanted to create a WhatsApp that encompasses my entire year, so you may want to look out for that as well.\n\nAs for the unorganization, I think that it's more so a thing that has been experienced by those in later years, and I haven't really experienced it myself, so unfortunately I can't really add more detail to that. I mention it just because it's something that I've heard from older years, and something that people in my year feel like they've experienced too.",

Although I haven't joined any clubs, or done anything aside from my course work, I've made many more friends here than I did when I attended York. Further, I feel that Humber has a better sense of community than YU ever did, and I was involved in clubs and sports there. \n\nAm I saying Humber is the best school? No, but in comparison to another BIG school I attended, I've had a much better experience thus far.\n\nI also see some other people here talking about some bad professors. TBH, every school you go to will have good and bad profs, no matter how much you apply yourself. Yes, I feel like I could get more out of my program if they had some better professors, but they always won't be able to get 5-star profs. \n\nNot sure what to expect once I move into the workforce, but I cannot say that I regret going to Humber. For me, it was the right move because I at least know I will walk out with more knowledge and experience than I had when I signed up.",

There will be cons to any school you attend but it\u2019s up to the individual to make the most out of their opportunities. This is coming from a first year interior design student with a 2 hour commute to get to Humber (1 way)",

If you are really dedicated it will work out, but based on what they said. The community for making friends in business is not the best. So, really up to you. For me, Humber is the best for my program based on my skills and it\u2019s connections so even if the community sucks. At the end of the day, you came to study and learn. So make the most out of it!",

I'm switching over to George Brown because I didn't feel like they lack of community in here. I always felt alone during my time there and I thought that they didn't have much clubs/events put in place.The teachers in my program were decent and the people were okay but still, I felt out of place at Humber. I'm at the Lakeshore campus so as one other person said, the only thing good about Humber (Lakeshore Campus) is the lake itself.",

I had some great professors, but I also had a my prof did not teach us one thing all semester. I\u2019m not exaggerating, he came in to class completed unprepared with 1-2 slides, tried to fill the time by taking coffee breaks and talking about careers, and randomly assigned the grades. He was one of many poor professors in the 1 year program I took.\n\nDealing with the faculty was impossible, they do not listen nor do they care. They clearly just want the money, they don\u2019t give a shit about the students at all. I you have an issue with anything at the school, there is no point in bringing it up- its a complete waste of time. \n\nI came to Humber with such high hopes for my program, and left feeling like I wasted my time and money. I was planning to continue taking courses at Humber, but I will never go back. Absolutely terrible school, aside from a few great professors.",

I went to Fanshawe for the law clerk program because it\u2019s their prerequisite for their paralegal diploma. Ended up hating it there. The campus was nasty like a run down high school and the professors lacked knowledge on what they were teaching. I ended up transferring which sucked cause I couldn\u2019t transfer my credits since the law society is involved with Humber\u2019s program and not Fanshawe\u2019s. The profs for the paralegal program here are way better and the campus is much nicer. I noticed a lot of ppl saying there\u2019s a lack of community at humber and I think stuff  that\u2019s something common among a lot of colleges. Fanshawe is primarily a school where everyone lives in student housing and it was the same vibe. Just everyone partied a lot more and it got a lil too much sometimes (for the boys flags and frat dudes gone wild). Anyway I really like humber and I\u2019ve made friends with a lot of ppl in my program. I didn\u2019t make friends w anyone outside it cause I commute and I\u2019m not involved in any clubs but I\u2019ll work on that. I still keep in contact w the friends I made at Fanshawe and I loved my roommates but I don\u2019t regret my decision at all. Plus having a degree gives me more options for post-grad education",

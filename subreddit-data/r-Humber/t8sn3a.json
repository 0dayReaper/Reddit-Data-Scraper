In addition, the gas prices are ridiculously expensive so some students are questioning on whether to return back in person or not. I don\u2019t understand why they decided to do it in the middle of the semester when we have 7 weeks left. If the management wants to reinforce \u201cback to in person\u201d learning then do it next semester, not now.",

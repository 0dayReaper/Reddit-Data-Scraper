I\u2019m just trying to figure out accommodation and my board now and I\u2019m wondering if I should go with Humber\u2019s dining plan? If I\u2019m considering living in the residences, would a dining plan be better for me or are there better options? \nP.S. are there any groups for Humber\u2019s international students I can be a part of for all my other queries?",

I\u2019m an international student who hasn\u2019t been to Canada before as well. I\u2019d recommend first sem in residence with the dining plan. Get used to the environment and make friends. Hopefully by the end of sem you have friends who you can move out with",

In my opinion, the better option would be to rent somewhere cheaper and then just buy your own groceries.\n\nThis is more money efficient and also gives you a rider range of options for food. However more inconvenient because it requires more effort, both in finding a good and cheap place to rent, and in having to do grocery shopping.",

The area around Lakeshore has some nice apartments and basement rentals, but it also has some pretty run down stuff. If you live off campus, then you have a wider area you can look in, if you are willing to travel. The TTC 44 bus stops right by the campus and is pretty frequent, so that can expand your area if you are willing to use transit. The 501 streetcar also goes right by the college, and can expand your potential housing area more, but there is construction on that route right now, so it can be (really) late.",

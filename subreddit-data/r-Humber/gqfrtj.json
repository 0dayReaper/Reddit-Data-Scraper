    "postText": "Hi there, so I am wondering if anyone feels the same way I do. So I am taking a full course load right now (summer 2020) and because of the whole situation everything is online. But the only thing that really bothers me is that only 1/7 of my profs is actually taking the time to use the schedule class time and teach. None of my other professor's areas expect to teach because they want us to learn on our own because its \"an online course\" but given the whole situation doesn't it make more sense that they carry out lectures, even if it is online. I don't know just my personal opinion what do yall think. And I do learn better hands-on so that's why I feel this way.",

            "comment": "While I agree with your opinion, in my experience, some profs actually conducted votes asking the class how to do online classes when the campus closed down during Winter; the majority of the classes voted for an environment where profs just posted their lectures and students learned themselves. I only speak from my experience, but it seems like they could be just interpreting that students will opt to never show up to classes and go this route. On the other hand, they could just be lazy.",

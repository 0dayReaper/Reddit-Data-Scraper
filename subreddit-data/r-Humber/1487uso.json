It means the amount you paid is currently in your humber balance account but it's still not use it yet (In other words Humber hasn't discounted it for your 1 semester fees yet) After a while it will be automatically discount and your balance should be 0. (If it happens to be a positive number, then you owe money. It's quite confusing)",

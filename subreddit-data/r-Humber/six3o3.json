What diplomas are worth getting ( so you can get a job right away) ?\n\nSorry, not trying to undermine anyone here, just not sure if I should pursue a diploma ... need advice",

More general degrees/diplomas like anything business related will give you a broader area for your job search which is good but at the same can make it difficult to narrow down what you want to do and find a job that matches that. \n\nI have a BA in Psychology and have worked in the hospitality industry my whole life. I am currently working towards getting into nursing so I can have a more stability.",

I think you typically hear this with regards to trades and technical diplomas/advanced diplomas. \n\n Getting a trade vs going to university will likely get you a job quicker (depending on what you would take at uni too).\n\nHumber offers a couple of different technical diplomas that have a high demand that may not specifically be seen as a 'trade'. Electromechanical Engineering Technology is an example.",

Or that could supplement a business degree/diploma.",

    "postText": "Help me decide! \n\nShould I go to Toronto Humber college Lakeshore campus or Kitchener Waterloo to Conestoga college (staying next to Laurier and U Waterloo so that I can have a social life, I drive so I won't have to take a bus for 60 min); the programs are comparable, bachelor's of public relations. Conestoga has a superior co-op program (2 paid co-op terms guaranteed instead of 1), but Humber has a superior reputation (although a lot of this seems to only come from what Humber graduates are saying).\n\nOSAP is promising to give me a living bursary allowance of $10,246 for accommodations. Is this enough to even rent in Etobicoke (Toronto), or does this seem like it is not enough?\n\nIs it expensive to go out for social activities in Toronto, i.e. clubs, bars, fitness classes? The cost for having a social life is important for me, since as a student I will be busy with classes. \n\nPlease tell me what your thoughts are on the two institutions. I.e. What are the racial and gender demographics (I heard that there are lots of Russians and Indians at Humber, is this true?), social life on campus, quality of profs, ease of mingling with other Colleges/Universities clubs and societies, and are there a lot of mature students vs 18-21 year olds",

Both have pros and cons obviously but I just felt like the profs at Conestoga didn't care at all about my learning or experience. Toronto is obviously expensive but Conestoga is outside of kw in Doon with nothing around it. \n\nJust my two cents with my experience.",

Initially I was considering the 4 year BA at Humber at lakeshore but after talking to admissions the 3 year diploma is more my cup of tea. I want a very hands on program where I can grow my technical skills and make connections. Looking for thoughts from students on if they are happy with the course, the benefits in their experience etc.",

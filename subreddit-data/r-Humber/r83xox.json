    "postText": "I'm 26 domestic. I am heading to Humber this upcoming Winter. I recently quit my job as I lost enjoyment on it. I studied in university for 4 years straight out of high school and the demographics were a pretty young age (18-22). Unfortunately I never really participated in clubs or parties.\n\nSince I'm heading back to school, I want to join clubs and make friends or go to parties (not too many). However, I feel I might not belong because I'm on the older side. Has anyone felt this way when trying to make friends or join clubs?",

I\u2019ve found the demographic of my program is older than when I went to uni fresh out of highschool, and Humber seems to have a way larger mix of different ages than a typical university. I would say do as you wish and make friends !! Also 26 is young, you\u2019ll be fine :)",

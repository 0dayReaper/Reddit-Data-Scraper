I\u2019ve heard this program is super competitive so if you just meet the cut off it may not be enough. \n\nI was hoping to pursue this program but my marks did not make the cut so I\u2019m hoping to get into the four year program. Wishing you the best of luck!",

I spoke to the head of admissions at humber back in November &amp; she said although the cut-off is 74% they usually look at averages 80% &amp; above since it\u2019s so competitive. I\u2019d suggest to try calculating your last 60 credit grades &amp; see if it\u2019s around there. They do look at the last 60 credits (approximately last 2 years) but I\u2019m honestly not too sure if you didn\u2019t complete your degree yet. It never hurts to call or email the admissions office to get more information, all their info is on their website. Also cut off is February 1st so try before then! I\u2019m super nervous as well but wishing you all the best! \u263a\ufe0f",

That\u2019s why I was asking if they consider the last 60 as your GPA or the overall\u2639\ufe0f I applied already but my uni transcripts are international unlike my highschool so they\u2019re still being evaluated by WES I hope that gets completed asap. Thank you again and good luck to you too I hope you get in!",

The email read as follows:\n\u201c A completed three- or four-year university degree with a 3.0/74 per cent grade point average (GPA) or higher in your most recent 60 credit hours (roughly your last two years of university).     \n\nApplicants that do not have a completed degree, but have at least 60 university credits hours, can still apply.               \n\nFor applicants who have completed more than 60 credit hours, the admission average will be calculated on the most recent 60 credit hours of course work. The grades for all courses taken within an academic term will be included in this calculation, even if this results in exceeding the 60 credit hours requirement.         \n\nNote: Due to the competitive nature of this program, all applicants are treated in rank order based on academic performance. Meeting the minimum GPA does not guarantee an offer of admission. Historically the cut off competitive GPA is a 3.4/ 80% GPA.\u201d",

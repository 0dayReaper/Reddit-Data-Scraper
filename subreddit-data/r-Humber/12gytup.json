    "postText": "Hello everyone, I joined the Nursing program in September 2021. For those who are going to Nursing program for the September 2023 intake, I have three textbooks available at the moment I wanna get rid of ASAP!! \n\nThe textbooks I have: Psychology: Themes and Variations 6th Edition (For PSYC-1000 course), Principles of Anatomy &amp; Physiology 16th edition (For ANAT 1100 course), and A Concise Introduction to World Religions 4th Edition (For course HUMA-2000, it\u2019s an elective course).\n\nI wanna give it away to those who are going into the program. So if you\u2019re interested buying the textbooks for a lower price, you can message me privately!",

The tips I would get give you is figure out how you study, a lot of people study differently do what is best for you in order to reach success. Time-management is very important so make sure you use your time wisely, and balance because school can really burn you out so it is important you find some time for yourself.",

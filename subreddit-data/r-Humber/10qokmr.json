I haven't seen any special requirements like a portfolio and such (at least not needing to be submitted by the 1st), are there any other requirements for submission for February 1st (besides providing transcripts)? I assume not, otherwise the ontario colleges website would probably bar me from being able to apply and pay the fee, right?",

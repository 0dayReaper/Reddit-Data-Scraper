All my peers are going for the event and it feels like the end of the world because I always wanted to go for such events. \n\nIs there any recommendation where I can find these upcoming events and network and what was your personal experience with these events (if you attended any)\n\nI'm new in this country with 0 work experience and I wanna tie all loose ends to bag a job for my co-op",

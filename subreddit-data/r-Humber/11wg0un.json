    "postText": "I graduated with a graduate diploma in business insights and analytics at Humber and wondering if the program has changed at all? was talking with someone and i remembered all the trauma and problems from the program that my friend in the program right now is going through. Has anything changed at all because it sounds like the quality of some of the professors hasn't changed and there is still no clear placement methods apparently? Personally, I still get trauma while working when I think about the program like hearing hallucinations of laughter and mocking of voices from past professors, but I thought it would change slightly.",

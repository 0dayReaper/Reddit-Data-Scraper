They encourage you to do it on your own and the course structure supports that.\n\nPersonally, I had 2 years of work experience abroad before doing this program. But, it was mostly working in a support based IT role.  In terms of searching for jobs, it didn't offer me any help at all. But, it surely gave me the 'skills' to crack an interview for a 100k developer job at a US based bank.",

But back when I was in my last year of high school and applied to a whole lot of different colleges and universities, I did have a couple that called me using upper year students to ask if I had any questions about the program, residence, etc. It\u2019s mostly to get anyone interested in the college/university to ask questions and get them answered or like draw them in a bit more I guess, since it\u2019ll make them seem like they \u201ccare\u201d and really want you to be informed and feel welcomed.",

Ive received calls from Humber or other schools before basically conducting surveys like this just to know what your experience is like, seem like they care and promote student engagement. I think its more so about making them look good and like they care about students and if you have a good experience then you're more likely to accept and go to Humber or atleast recommend Humber to others or have good things to say about them.",

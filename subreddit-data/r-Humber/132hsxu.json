What would be the best course of action from here? Do I just need to get better grades and I\u2019ll be on the clear?",

It is already included in your tuition -- you can use the writing centre for example. Talk to your program coordinator and see if you are eligible for any accommodations. There is no reason to be shy or ashamed about asking for help. There are lots of supports available for you and it will be provided in a positive and supportive manner.",

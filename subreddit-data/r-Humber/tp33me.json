I got a conditional offer since I\u2019m still enrolled for winter semester at York but I met the GPA requirement, mine is 3.9/95% in my last 60 credits.",

I probably don't have a lot in common in you because I am a mature student returning to school for a second career but learning is learning.  If you need any help with learning, the school is there for you.  At first, I wasn't sure I would actually go through with my first year because it had been a long time since I was university, but Humber College made it happen for me.  They look out for you.  You can't say that about every school.  I'm not really out there on social media. Facebook is my generation.",

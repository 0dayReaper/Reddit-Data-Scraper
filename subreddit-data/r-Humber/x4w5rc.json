If you plan to not work during your time away, know that 3 weeks of absence is essentially 25% of your semester soooooo, might not wanna miss it.",

I have a friend in the interior decorating program and she says that attending class is integral and some profs give her a hard time for missing a class here and there because she plays on a Humber sports team. You might consider deferring for a semester depending on what your reason is for missing that much school.",

I think there is a lot of presentation and group work in interior decorating so it makes sense. Because she\u2019s in sports at humber she has a dedicated academic counsellor that will deal with situations like these for her so she gets the appropriate accommodations.  \n\nAlso keep in mind, the students that attend classes tend to do better than those who do not.  Either way reach out to an academic counsellor or your program coordinator for advice.",

There will be a lot of midterms and assignments you will miss and profs are not required to give you a makeup. \n\nYour best move is to speak with your program coordinator and she or he will give  you the best advice on how to proceed.",

    "postText": "So i applied on the 8th of December, 2021 for the Advertising - media management program and since then its only shown \u201cno decision\u201d in the portal. I know that a lot of people are going through the same thing and my agent said Humber hasnt even rolled out any LOA for sept 2022 intake. So\u2026do i just wait??? Like is that ok?? Because i got a LOA from Lambton and while that\u2019s not a priority im just nervous that ill waste an entire year IF humber doesn\u2019t accept me haha. Just trying to stay positive tho ;-; also applied to george brown and heard that even that takes really long to reply.",

So hang in there, we'll probably get ours soon!\n\nI sent an email to Humber and they said it might take 10 weeks",

They'll have you do an in person Math (basic math) and English test and if you are successful (whateve the passing grade is) you are in.\n\nWhen you apply as a mature student (anyone over 19 yrs of age) the admission process is less painful than for those just graduating the HS.\n\nSo you have pretty good chances of getting in....just make sure you prepare yourself for those math and English tests. You can find practice material online at no cost.",

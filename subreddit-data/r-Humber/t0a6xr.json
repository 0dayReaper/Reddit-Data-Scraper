            "comment": "Hello u/Character-Strike-132, congratulations on your offer of admission. I personally completed this program from a different college of applied arts and tech in Ontario. You can find opportunities in financial services such as banking and wealth management. Most that complete the course aim to become financial planners via PFP and CFP designations but you can also find yourself working in administration at such organizations if that's your strength. As well, there are opportunities in multi-asset management if you are willing to obtain further education. I'm not familiar with PGDM as a term but most will go for designations like the CFA, MBA, and/or but not limited to the CIM if they want to work in more research based roles  or high paying sales roles. This is all just based on my experience in the industry for the last 4 years - I'm sure others will have a different and much more vast experience with the roles they were able to obtain after completing the program. Good luck!",

Additionally, does anyone know the location of these assessments? The location says \u201cNorth - Off Campus\u201d\u2026 What does this mean?",

You should get an email with the link for the meeting session days prior or the day of your assesment. Remember the date of your assesment and do not miss out! Good luck.",

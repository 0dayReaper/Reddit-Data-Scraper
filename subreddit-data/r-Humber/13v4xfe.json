    "postText": "I'm preparing to start the application process next school year for the Class 1 Funeral Directing program at Humber! I'm excited, but theres an issue. I dont have my G1 yet. If I get it tomorrow (May 30th) I can maybe just barely make the deadline for the application. I don't know what to do, should I reach out to somebody at Humber and tell them whats going on? Is there any way to submit my G2 at a later date? The funeral home I'm working at now said they were pretty chill when it came to drivers licenses, at least within the program.  I'm not so though, so I'm asking here. Thank you!!",

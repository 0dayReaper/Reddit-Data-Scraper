    "postText": "Hi this is my first time posting on Reddit so hopefully I'm doing this right!\n\nA family member and I are both planning on attending Humber next fall, and are considering housing options. There was one possibility we were considering but were unsure if it would be possible to arrange, and I wanted to look into the possibility sooner then later.\n\nWould it be possible for us to apply for a suite style room together? Or are roommates only assigned by the college? I know returning students are the priority for the suite style rooms but I figured it couldn't hurt to at least look into the option.\n\nI would be greatful for any impute! Thank you.",

Some Masters programs websites say that you have to have \u201can undergraduate degree in social work or a related/equivalent program.\u201d Some  just say from an social work program. I am not too sure if they literally mean a BSW or any degree in the social work field. You would apply in your 4th year. Beyond that I do not know too much. I have a meeting coming up with a career advisor (free through student fees at Humber) to try to figure it out. It\u2019s really confusing.",

But I\u2019m not sure if BCyc falls under the category. but if you don\u2019t mind, I would be extremely thankful if you let me know after your meeting because I\u2019m actually really nervous about this.",

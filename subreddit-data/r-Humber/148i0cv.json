    "postText": "Hi, I am an international student. I had applied to Humber and after I did, I had recently asked them to swap around my first and second preference of programs that I had applied to.   \nNow I got an email saying they have done it, and my first preference is reflecting correctly on the portal. However, the program is showing as 3rd in the 'inactive programs' portion in the portal, so I am a little confused about whether it is actually my 2nd preference or 3rd as it is not mentioned in the portal.",

Which has the least?\n\nWhich industry has the most growth?",

            "comment": "I think marketing has the most legs for exploring different career options. PR is going to put you in the PR corner and advertising is just the promotional side of things.   \n  \nWith marketing you can pivot into PR or Advertising with a solid foundation.   \n  \nIf you're interested in a diploma Humber Lakeshore offers a really cool shared semester.   \n  \nThe Advertising and Marketing Communications, advertising graphic design, Public Relations, media communications, and journalism programs all share the same first semester.   \n  \nYou can get a little taste of all five programs and pivot to the stream that is right for you in the second semester without skipping a beat. \n  \nI completed Advertising and Marketing Communications for a really solid marketing foundation. I went into the advertising side of things and jumped into the copywriting post-grad program. Many of my ADMC cohort went straight into the industry from that program though. Many as coordinators at ad agencies, writers for brands, digital marketers. You name it!   \n  \nPlease feel free to DM me with any questions about it \ud83d\ude42.",

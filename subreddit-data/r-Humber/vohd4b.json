    "postText": "I have been working on this app for a while now and I am really excited to share it with you. It's a college marketplace with some other features restricted to students - you can only log in once you verify your **humber.ca** school email! (you'll receive a 5 digit code in your inbox)\n\nYou can buy, or sell anything you want to other students, ranging from dorm supplies, textbooks, lost&amp; found, promote services, tutoring, apparel, and ride-sharing, to subleasing or finding off-campus housing for next year... There's also a discussion section to anonymously ask/answer questions.\n\nA lot of hard work went into it, so check it out if you need anything for the upcoming semesters!\n\nlink to the app: [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) and tell your friends! Also, [follow on IG](https://www.instagram.com/collegesouk/) for support\ud83d\ude0a\n\nLastly, please go ahead and post something people are already using it :) \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc2b hope it helps (upvote for visibility)!\n\n\\- might be a little glitchy on galaxy hoping to fix that soon, also just want to mention that the idea is abstracted to support multiple universities :) each university got its own separate marketplace!\n\nPlease dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this, if you want to become an ambassador, or if anyone is interested in writing an article about this! - more students means more cheap and helpful stuff on the app",

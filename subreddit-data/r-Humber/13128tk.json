            "comment": "Great if you love writing code, not so much if you're more interest in other areas. Definitely not good if you only joined because you thought that playing games is fun and therefore making them must be a good career.\n\nIt's a lot of hard work, but by the time you graduate you should be a very hirable programmer. The course mostly focuses on C++, but you learn lots of other stuff too. There are courses on networking, OpenGL, Vulkan, and tons of other useful topics for a career as a game programmer. By the end of the course you'll be learning some pretty advanced stuff. I recall a couple of professors once saying the bachelor of computer science students at UoT don't learn some stuff we do in first year until their last year and that some stuff we learn in our last year they never learn before graduating.\n\nIf programming isn't something that interests you than the courses offered at other colleges might suit your interests better. Unfortunately, I can't confirm whether those others courses will help you find work as easily. Best thing I can say is that almost everyone who graduates from this program finds work in the industry. There are just a lot of people who don't graduate, though. A lot of reasons for that, but the difficulty of the program is becoming less significant of one every year. Most people who drop out these days realize they're just not interested rather than having trouble keeping up with the workload.",

It's going to be really expensive for an international student, however. And you're going to still need a work visa after you graduate if I understand how that works properly.",

            "comment": "graduated from this program in 2022\n\nthe program is basically constantly evolving, so my experience may not match expectations though i doubt the core of the program has changed much - and that is c++. i'd say a good 60-70% of the program focuses on c++ and linear algebra, something i was honestly quite unprepared for, math is a very large part of the program and the idea is that by the time you graduate you could basically be a software engineer. there is heavy emphasis on graphics programming with openGL and Vulkan, with a lot to support you into building your own game engine.\n\nthe rest of the program is speckled with different facets of gamedev, a few classes around unity and unreal, 3d modelling, design, and online presence - though these are the elements of the course that were changing a lot.\n\nif you genuinely enjoy math and low level programming(scott fielder is your best friend), this program is a solid choice that may lead to a lot more paths than just the game industry.\n\nif you don't have a huge love for math though, you may feel a little overwhelmed - it may be good to consider other options.",

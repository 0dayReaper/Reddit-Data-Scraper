    "postText": "Long story short, i\u2019m i a first year in business administration and i\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s normal to be taking 6 courses which is equivalent to 18 credit hours. \n\nIs it me or does this seem like too much ? I don\u2019t know anyone at humber since it\u2019s all online, so is this normal, is anyone else\u2019s program making them take 6 courses ? and the fact that they\u2019re three hour classes??? wtf\u2026 my friends in uni only take 4-5 classes and they run about 1 -2hour depending on the class.\n \nThe semester starts on monday, and i\u2019m so stressed out over these classes. The workload just seems like SO much. i literally started crying LMFAO.",

            "comment": "Prof here.\n\nThere are lots of supports at Humber to help you if you need it. However, the number one bit of advice I would give is...DO THE READING. Your prof will probably assign you reading, then teach that content in the class. Most students don't do the reading in advance, thinking they will just learn the material in class. However, if you've already read -- even skimmed or read the chapter summary, then the class is about reinforcing the material.\n\nEven better -- read the chapter and highlight the tricky parts. In class (or via the chat) ask a question that clarifies a tricky concept. Not only will this help you, but it shows the prof that you have done the reading...believe me, this makes a difference!",

I can't speak to other colleges, but for humber 18 credit hours per semester sounds about par.  \n\n\nIn practice, especially online, i actually highly doubt the classes are going to be three hours, really. Realistically,  your lectures will often be 1 hour/2 hours and you'll be putting whatever amount of study time in per day after that.    \n\n\nIf you are stressed out, you can lighten the load a liltle bit by postponing your electives to summer, but if you do that you have to eat the summer tuition fee of 250$ plus the other mandatory fees, so your call.",

I\u2019m only in my second semester of first year so my experience is limited but I\u2019ll warn you that the anatomy prof doesn\u2019t care how much content he throws at you, he literally added 3 new units a week before our exam. Also, I know york is starting a new nursing program and after having looked at it it looks like more manageable. I think they take 4-5 courses a semester and they don\u2019t have to take microbiology until second or third year meanwhile at humber we have to take it now in first year",

    "postText": "I'm a student who has recently completed my Bachelors in Management Studies. I have applied to Humber for the Business Insights and Analytics program for Fall 2023. I have found a lot of mixed opinions regarding the course. I would like to know from someone who has completed the course/ is currently pursuing the course whether or not an international student with no background in IT or programming languages should apply for this course. Will they cover all the basics or are you expected to know different programming languages from the start. Any information will be helpful. Thanks.",

            "comment": "How are you liking the program so far? Have you started? I graduated last year, I think we were their second group but the classes have some decent professors. The operations profs were great and relaxed. They cover all the basics, and more which was fun. The difficulty is with the work placement portion, there is no structure, lots of different hoops you have to jump through to get answers, no accommodation for students, unrealistic: don't understand how we are supposed to complete part-time placement on top of full-time classes when we were told in the first semester not to get jobs, and the courseload is the same 6 credits? Don't be surprised but I think people in this program lie to their employers, or maybe they're really lucky because some of these places want full-time interns and find it easier to just pretend you're not taking 6 classes while working for the employer. You will have to find field placement on your own unless you are one of the favorites of the program coordinator so kiss up to them because they determine your future in this course. Other than that, enjoy your time, meet people and learn the art of kissing up.",

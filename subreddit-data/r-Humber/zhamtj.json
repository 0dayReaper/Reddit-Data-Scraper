I got a decent GPA and I've worked as an engineer for a few years, but I'm looking to switch careers.\n\nI discovered Humber College's practical nursing two-year program and I'm considering applying. How difficult is it to get accepted into this program? What factors would affect my chances of being accepted? Thanks in advance!",

I received a conditional offer however even After submitting IB transcripts of scores and IELTS scores, the portal is showing missing requirements as of 16th April 2022, whereas i submitted all required documents. So I needed to know whether I am actually missing any requirements or it's the system delay. Secondly, could you explain the requirements shown on the screenshot attached to this mail so that I could proceed faster as I am an international Student.",

When I was applying a several years ago, it took until mid to late June to get my official acceptance letter because final grades had to be submitted so that they can confirm that I actually met all the requirements. If you're still in school, this might be the case for you too.\n\n&gt;the requirements\n\nIn the Canadian curriculum, I think there's three options for math courses for math courses at the Grade 12 level. iirc they're: Calculus and Vectors, Data Management, Advanced Functions (Not 100% if that's what this one is called). But they just want you to have taken at least one of these courses or another course that has the same content (hence the \"equivalent\").The second requirement would be just any course that is equivalent to a Canadian course that exists for grades 11s or 12s. It's really vague but if you took anything like Philosophy, Business, Nutrition, any sciences, that were above the grade 10 level, those would work (as long as they weren't compulsory courses).\n\nI hope this helps!  \n\n\nEdit: grammar",

I am just worried that they are not too late to send the official acceptance letter because the visa process will take up to 3 months.\n\nNevertheless, Thanks a lot for the reply! \nHopefully they reply soon!",

If you guys also have any other recommendations or ideas on how I could get to school from orangeville, I\u2019d really appreciate it cause google hasn\u2019t really been that helpful. Thanks",

            "comment": "There is no shuttle, there is a big TTC bus stop on notth campus you can take 2 busses to Lakeshore. \n\nOrangeville realistically you probably need a car, find someone doing the same and split the gas or spend half the day on 3 different agency busses.",

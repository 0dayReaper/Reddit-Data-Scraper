    "postText": "Is there any hope at all that the tuition will decrease for fall 2020 considering how the classes are mostly going to be online? We saw how winter 2020 online classes failed miserably and I saw many posts here about how people were disappointed with their online classes for Summer 2020 as well. \nIf online classes is what we wanted, we could have easily chosen a course which was actually online - and better structured and cheaper.\nOn top of all this international fees have increased again as well to above 19,000$ for two semesters!\n\nIs there any petition anyone already created for this? Is there anything at all that we can TRY to do to make things change?",

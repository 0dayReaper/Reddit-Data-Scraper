    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m a new student entering Humber and I know I\u2019m a bit too late here, but I\u2019m entirely confused here. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll be able to select courses and I\u2019m in dire need of help. I would go to a guidance councillor, but I\u2019m not sure how to set up an appointment or such. Is there anything that I should know? \n\nEdit: does anyone know how to pick courses and if the dates to pick courses have passed or not? \nI\u2019m going to Humber for Business Administration btw\n\nI know my question isn\u2019t clear, but I\u2019m certainly lost.",

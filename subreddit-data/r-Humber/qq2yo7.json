So far, I'm between a Diploma and an Ontario Graduate Certificate (4 semesters both, I will apply to get the PGWP), but I'm not sure if any of those is berter than the other. \n\nIf you know, in the long term, which one is better, I'd really appreciate it.",

All my classes were online before as of till next semester.\n\nSince I've never visited Humber before in person, I just wanted to ask how are in-person classes? Are the classes small and interactive or big rooms with several students? Also, where can I navigate my classes I don't understand where I can find the room and building numbers and names for all my classes next semester.\n\nI'd appreciate an answer,\n\nThanks!",

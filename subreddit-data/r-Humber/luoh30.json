Crossing fingers for you and hope you are able to submit the transcript soon and get accepted! \n\nResponses to college program offers are due on May 1. I don't know if the second entry program is an exception to this deadline, because they only opened up for applications a month ago. \n\nIf you have any concerns about the transcript being submitted later, I encourage you to get in touch with the program admissions folks soon and mention your situation, if you haven't yet. \n\nFeel free to keep me updated! I hope you get in!",

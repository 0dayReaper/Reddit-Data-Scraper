    "postText": "So I\u2019m attending the PR post grad certificate. I\u2019m super confused by the way humber operates, as we know it\u2019s online until January 24th (which i had to search for myself got no email nothing) I\u2019m trying to possibly find out where my classes would be online?? There\u2019s nothing on myhumber portal that lets me see my classes, where the online classes would be etc. I\u2019ve done other research on it and have tried to see if there was some other portal and can\u2019t seem to get any information on that either. I also have not been asked to make any sort of email for the school or any info on how to do that. Just looking for some guidance! Thanks in advance :) \n\nPs. I am currently stuck in Europe with COVID and won\u2019t be back until the 14th, i won\u2019t be able to make orientation due to time difference, to my understanding, orientation is optional. Just clarifying?",

N00000000@humber.ca.\n\nWe use Blackboard for online classes, some Professors might have unlocked their course for viewing and some might not till just before classes start. To get to Blackboard I use the Humber Central Authentication site.  \n\nHave you registered for your classes as yet? You should see them in your MyHumber.",

It shows me my timetable and where the classes and room is but i see nothing about where the actual online classes will take place ( your link just takes me to the myhumber portal where it says student, financial aid etc). \n\nThank you for answering also about the email. How do I create one? Or will I receive an email to make one in a few days before classes?",

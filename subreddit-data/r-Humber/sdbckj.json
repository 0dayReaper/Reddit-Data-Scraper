For food, it depends on your campus. For North Campus, there is a main cafeteria that residence students go to and those students just have meal plans so you\u2019ll hand over this residence card that they\u2019ll scan and will essentially take whatever amount of money for the food you got off of the card. You can also pay with cash if needed but most get a meal plan and use the card. There are other smaller places on campus where you can get food, things like Tims and Booster Juice. North campus even has restaurant that has food made by the culinary students I believe..and a spot that sells stuff made within the culinary classes. At Lakshore, its one main cafeteria in the residence building and then one in another building with smaller places around that sell food. From my personal experience, I prefer the food at North campus.",

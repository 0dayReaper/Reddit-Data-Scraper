I wanted to know since Humber offered the same courses for the first two years in both Finance and Marketing if I would have repeat the entire Finance Degree or continue on from Semester 5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Marketing graduate who holds a degree and wants to get into Finance. Are the Marketing credits transferable into the Finance degree.",

None of them were international students, though. \n\nTbh, it's probably a good idea to figure out what you would want to use the degree for before continuing the program. I actually don't know anybody who is still using their degree for the work they do now. If you're not passionate about the work that a degree in police foundations might enable you to do then it could be more worth your time and money to switch to something else. It's a long program with very limited options for career outcomes and tuition is super expensive for international students.",

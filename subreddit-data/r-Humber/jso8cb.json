    "postText": "I've found that most of my professors only have \"class\" for an hour or two a week, where all they do is read off the slides and provide nothing new; or they do over maybe 2 or 3 practice questions and then end the \"lecture.\"\n\nThis is making it extremely difficult for me to learn as it seems like they aren't providing me with a proper education. \n\nI understand it takes some getting used to for them as well, and they can't exactly teach how they like when not in a classroom, but it also seems that they are still providing the exact same, if not more, amount of homework and pre-COVID classes. And then get upset because the students aren't doing that well.\n\nEssentially, it's pretty damn difficult to teach yourself these subjects. \n\nI'm wondering how everyone else is managing, any tips, tricks, or questions for your fellow students?",

Where they just read from the slides and give you pre made 50 question multiple choice exams from the slide deck. \n\nAt least in person you could chat with a friend to make it less boring",

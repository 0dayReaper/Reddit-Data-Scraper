The professors I\u2019ve had were decent, but the program itself is just so broad and I dropped out. Finding a co-op placement was a pain in the a** and they do not help at all. To get a job in business, make connections and have lots of work experience! A diploma in this field is just a cherry on top unfortunately",

If you do go for it, trust me that networking and experience is what\u2019s going to get you far so keep that in mind it\u2019ll help you a lot",

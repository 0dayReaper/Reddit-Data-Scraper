Since it\u2019s a pretty straight shoot and I only have to transfer once at Kipling to get on the 927 bus, it doesn\u2019t feel long at all. I thought it was going to be a terrible commute but I actually don\u2019t mind it at all. \n\nTo me it\u2019s totally worth it because it\u2019s the best college for my program and I really like the campus and the school in general.",

Depending on your program, I'd buddy up with someone who lives close to campus so you can have a couch to crash on in case you have a late night. The 191 was a nightmare but that's changed by this point potentially. Humber is a great school though and worth the trek imo. Just accept that you'll be commuting for 2.5 hours a day roughly and it becomes a lot easier.",

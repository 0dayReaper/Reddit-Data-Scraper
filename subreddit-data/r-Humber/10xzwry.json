You\u2019re able to fully pick your schedule so pick what works best for you. \n\nAlso, the first semester is the least enjoyable.  Don\u2019t let it deter you from the rest of the course, assuming you want to get into IT.  \n\nThe first semester is designed to let you branch out into other programs if you enjoy those more.  \n\nThere\u2019s a C programming class, an electric circuits class (this one is very tough), a computer hardware course, and some other networking based courses. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions :)",

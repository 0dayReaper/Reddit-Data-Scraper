    "postText": "So basically, I'm supposed to start a co-op in the winter term but I got a placement in Aug-Nov. This means I was able to complete the mandatory 100 hours. But, for some reason, they didn't offer co-op for the fall semester and now I'm stuck cause apparently the school won't let me just transfer the hours so it coincides with the winter semester. My problem is that I have 100 hours and I honestly don't have the time in winter since I'll be having classes every day. What do you guys think I should do?",

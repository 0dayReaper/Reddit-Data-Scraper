    "postText": "Hello, I\u2019m interested in potentially applying to some programs at Humber and TMU, and I\u2019m wondering if I can get into any place with my terrible marks. I failed 3/4 courses during my only semester of uni while at York and the only class I passed I got 50-55. I was suffering and still am to a lesser degree from mental health issues and a breakdown. Is there any way for me to get into any programs? I really do not want to go back to York for the time being but I still want an education. I don\u2019t think I can continue my current major at all.",

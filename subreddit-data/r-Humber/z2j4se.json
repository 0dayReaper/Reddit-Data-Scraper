If you choose to blackout before a cut off date, then they check, if you have a rejected visa, they charge 100$ as admin fees and if you have the visa or backout for any other reason, then they cut 1000$ from your fees submission and refund the rest. \n\nThe information is available on the website along with cut off dates, feel free to check it out .",

    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI recently accepted an offer at Humber College (North Campus) for Fall 2020. I live pretty close to the area by car so I have decided I am going to drive to school as opposed to busing.\n\nSo I checked the Humber parking pass and its almost $300 for 4 months! My program is 12 months long meaning I will spend $900 on parking!! I am not in the best financial situation, especially due to the current circumstances, so this does not seem like a feasible option to me.\n\nI noticed that there is a neighbourhood right in front of the campus so I am asking you for a favour!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I WILL PAY YOU MONEY $$$  TO PARK IN YOUR DRIVEWAY FOR THE YEAR!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not have my class schedule yet but I am pretty sure I will have class everyday. We can negotiate on the price (obviously way less than the $900) if you message me and I'll be more than happy to answer any other questions you may have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a millennial trynna save some money, I can pay cash or e-transfer... just hmu!",

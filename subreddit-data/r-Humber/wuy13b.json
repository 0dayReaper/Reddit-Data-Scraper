    "postText": "I just received 4 successive emails about my course sections being cancelled due to low enrolment. Surely this must have happened to others? \nI understand why a college would need to do this, but this caused me so much stress in a matter of seconds. I (and I\u2019m sure plenty of other students)  now have to re-register for classes that I meticulously planned my schedule for. I know I cannot be alone on this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this sounds like a \u201ccan I speak the manager\u201d type of complaint but I really needed to know that I am not alone in this panic-inducing situation.",

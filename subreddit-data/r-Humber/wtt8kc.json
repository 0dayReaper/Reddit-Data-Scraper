    "postText": "So went through a lot of turmoil, nothing official that would get me a pardon card in college but basically I bombed my summer 2022 semester and now have the whole academic standing being required to withdraw even though I already payed for my fall 2022 semester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should my next move be? Despite not having another breakdown. Is there someway I can get them to just let me continue to go to school and/or get my money back for the fall semester.",

It is hers or his job to help you out and they have seen situations like yours before.\n\nHumber has a lot of really good support systems that help students who are having trouble. This includes mental health, study skill training, and academic accommodations. Ask for help -- it is there for you.",

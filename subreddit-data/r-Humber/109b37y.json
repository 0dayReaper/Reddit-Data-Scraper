Of course every course has it\u2019s difficulties but I find that as long as you go over lecture slides and put in the time, you\u2019ll get good grades. Everyone is very nice and helpful and there\u2019s groupchats to help each other in classes. My grade in grade 11 was an 85% and grade 12 was an 86%. Let me know if you wanna know anything else :)",

I haven\u2019t started clinical yet I\u2019m pretty sure that starts second year where you do simulation labs plus actual in hospital clincal work, you could ask someone from the humber nursing society @thehumbernursingsociety on ig for more info on that tho\n\n2. All my profs first sem were really good, I\u2019ve heard some werent the best but you can check ratemyprofessor online to see before you register for classes \n\n3. (I\u2019m assuming this was for my first sem grades I can\u2019t remember my highschool ones sorry)\nFor Writing communication i finished with a 98% (reallyyy easy class I didn\u2019t even show up half the time) \nIntro to Nursing was 74% \nPsychology was 77% \nAnatomy was 87%\n\nThe other two were my electives :) Hope this helps!",

I don\u2019t see my friends outside of school much though it\u2019s difficult to plan when schedules are so different. If you\u2019re more organized than me I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to find time for school and friends as well :)",

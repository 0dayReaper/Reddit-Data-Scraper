Not only are the parking lots pretty much a 10 minute ish walk from campus theyre always fucking full. Ontop of that the lots r so small only about 50 cars in a lot. With about 1000+ students attending come on? And dont foget the constant construction in the parking lot which reduced the size even more and construction on lakeshore which has traffic moving like a worm. I park in the green p parking lot nexg to the dog park and just stopped paying. My classes run for more than three hours and u can only park for three. Ps unless you show up early or ask a student on the way to parking lot if they could take ur spot good luck parking my friend",

But there are so many residential streets that you can park at for free but you would have to come 20mins early to secure a spot and usually the walk is 10-15mins. My cousin's family also lives right by there and they have like 3 parking spots that they charge (more than the price of Humbers) and it always gets filled.",

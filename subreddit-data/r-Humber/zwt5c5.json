I was pretty confident and excited, but now I\u2019m nervous about what my job prospects would like after graduation.\nIf someone\u2019s finished it, do you mind helping me out a bit and answering a couple of questions? Maybe we could hop on direct message? \nThanks in advance.",

How do placements work? Is there a possibility one may not get one? Any tips to make sure I succeed? Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.",

Lots of reflections and some group work that is manageable.\n\n2. For my cohort we had some issues with the placement coordinator who ended up leaving. This was right after the covid restrictions ended so Humber had very little to offer students regarding placements. In previous years students would get a booklet with organizations that would accept students but for my cohort we had no help and had to get placements on our own. Despite this I believe everyone found a placement. If you were unable to you could do a final research project to get your grade.\n\n3. Participation really matters and can help you get references especially for grad school. Attend class, show engagement and it really goes a long way. \n\n4. I was really impressed with the instructors in this program and how they pushed us to be aware of things like intersectionality, poverty, race and class. Being aware of these concepts will help you delve deeper into your assignments. \n\nOverall I totally recommend this program to anyone intrested in social work, social services etc. It is a great way to learn tangible skills like counselling in addition to extensive knowledge related to mental disorders and addiction.",

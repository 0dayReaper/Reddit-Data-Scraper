    "postText": "Hello beer, food, and music lovers!\n\nMy team and I are students in the Market Research for Events course at Humber College. We are conducting research to find out if people are ready to attend large outdoor events after the elimination of Covid-19 health and safety measures in Ontario.\n\nWe hope you can help us fill out the survey to confirm our findings. The survey will take about 6 to 9 minutes to complete. All collected data is for educational purposes only, and it is anonymous.\n\nWe are targeting about 200 surveys to be completed so we would appreciate it very much if you could help us out. Please share the survey with your friends, family, co-workers, and anyone else! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nHere is the link to the survey: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TFOB2022](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TFOB2022?fbclid=IwAR2HVMhiTM8fKgv3GdMvliDS3MRPouRbNNoIaP-FLECg1CHiGfE85eqG3sk)\n\nThank you for your time and support. Stay safe and healthy!",

    "postText": " Hello I was just wondering if I could unsend a withdrawal form. This is because I wanted to only withdraw from my courses or my semester but not my program as I am planning to continue studies in the following semester (Winter 2023). I didn't realize that to drop my courses I had to go to the registration form and click drop courses, but instead I went on the withdrawal form because it said to withdraw from program OR semester which I wanted\u00a0to do to avoid academic penalty as my grades for this Fall 2022 semester are low.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI figured I would help clarify humber's paramedic admission process. I do not have exact numbers but roughly 70% of your addmission profile is based on the grade recieved on admissions test. They take the average of your math, bio and chem. English is only used to determine your english class. Then we have up to 10% profle based on if you have attended university or college. The last 20% is based on your previous job experience, certifications and informal essay.\n\nNOTE: It is most competitive in the sense that they do not take high school, college or university grades and its based solely on addissions test. Only your education level matters for 10% of profile. Thus, people with degrees or poor high school marks it gives a level good opportunity to get in.\n\nExample: Profile score\n\n80% on test x 70% weight = 56\n\n10% education boost = 10\n\n80% profile score x 20% weight = 16\n\nTotal score= 82% profile score\n\nCutoff for 2023 addmision = 80%\n\nPlay around with your numbers on what you would need to get in but that is how it works!!\n\nThanks,\n\nConfused Hobbit",

By trash student I mean I got kicked out of uni after failing pretty much every class and having a 65 as my highest mark. My high school ones were average but definitely not stellar",

    "postText": "Hey guys, I just wanted to ask a question in regards to how the paths work if anyone knows. What happens after I graduate from my Graphic Design diploma program ? I want to continue higher education but I am not sure if I would be applying for an undergraduate or graduate program. I am not sure what the paths are, do I have to complete my diploma program then go undergraduate program to qualify for graduate program? Or can I skip undergraduate and go straight to graduate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time all :D.",

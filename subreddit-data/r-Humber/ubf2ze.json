    "postText": "Hello! I have been accepted at Humber's Bachelor of PR program for the Fall 2022 term. However, I am curious about the program? How are the classes there, the professor, and the co-op term? And is it easy to make friends there? Is it worth it or there are better ones at other uni or college? As I am an international student, I do not want to regret and waste my time and money. I try emailing some alumni from that program but no one responded. Thank you~",

If you live in the residence there I think it would definitely be easy for you to make friends there. Maybe joining clubs would also help this. All the professors I\u2019ve had there have been amazing.",

My experience of the school has been really great  so I haven\u2019t seen or heard of it going downhill\u2014 by anyone or even by other students that I know.",

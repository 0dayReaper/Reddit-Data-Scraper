(don\u2019t go to fiction it\u2019s awful) dorms are \u201cactive\u201d if your definition is just cram people into a small room and play music and think you\u2019re absolutely wild. there are occasional house parties but they really aren\u2019t too crazy either. \n\nit\u2019s not a party school and depending on what you consider a party - you won\u2019t find one anywhere near it.",

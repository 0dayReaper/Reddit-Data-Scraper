Your class letter&amp;number should be on the very bottom of every course description (or below the time period of your class). \n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, download Humber Campus Compass on ur phone to help you get to your classes! It\u2019s literally like google maps, just type in your classroom letter&amp;number and hit start and it\u2019ll tell you where to go. \n\nI hope this helps, good luck tomorrow!",

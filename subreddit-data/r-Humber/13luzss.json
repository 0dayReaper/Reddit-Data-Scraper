    "postText": "So I applied to the bachelor's of Science in nursing program and haven't completed grade 12 bio but am currently doing it through TVO ILC online. So I contacted all the schools I've applied to including George Brown and Seneca and told them about my situation and got a conditional offer from Seneca and my George Brown application forwarded to TMU, but I haven't got a response fron Number. I reached out the nursing amdission officer through phone and email but haven't received a response but the general nursing admissions email got back to me to say that admission requirements can't be waived and they need a midterm mark. For anybody who hasn't taken TVO ILC courses, they take a while to complete marking so even if I complete my work, it's going to take a while until my midterm mark gets to them and seats will probably be full (I explained this in my email and voicemails I sent to everybody btw). Anybody have any advice or suggestions on what to do?",

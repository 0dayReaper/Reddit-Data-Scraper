    "postText": "i graduated humber nov 3, and have been applying to universities (with my humber grades &amp; diploma) since. i just don\u2019t know if i\u2019m allowed to stay in canada while waiting for university decisions (i\u2019m an international student, but i\u2019m not enrolled in humber anymore &amp; haven\u2019t been studying) \n\nik i can apply for a pgwp, but i\u2019m thinking of doing this after university. i also am working rn. my student + work permit expires in march 2023 but i\u2019ve heard that these documents pretty much becomes nothing when you\u2019ve graduated. international students can also work up to 40 hours now &amp; i\u2019ve been working full time pretty much.\n\nif i\u2019m not allowed to stay here while waiting for decisions i will leave lol, i miss my dogs. it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a lot easier to apply from within canada even as an international student and most of my things are here. \n\nextra info: i graduated with honours &amp; my program was something to do with business.\nedit: my last day of studies was in august, but i had to stay to receive my diploma. apparently you have to leave 90 days after your last day of studying :-( university decision letters don\u2019t come that fast :-(\n\nedit (2): i\u2019ve stopped working, i do not wanna work illegally. i plan on applying for a pgwp on friday.",

And, if you get accepted into a uni and apply for a study permit extension before March 2023, then you can stay as well after March 2023.\n\nIdk who told you \"these documents pretty much become nothing when you\u2019ve graduated\" that's absolutely wrong.\n\nEdit: This isn't entirely right for this specific case, my comment below is more accurate",

Can I continue to work after I\u2019ve finished my study program?\nGenerally, no. **You must stop working once you\u2019ve received your final grades.**\n\nYou can continue to work after you finished your studies only if:\n\nyou\u2019ve already applied for a work permit, or\nyou\u2019re starting a new study program\n\nhttps://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1472&amp;top=15\n\n&gt;&gt; If you\u2019re starting a new study program\nYou can work full-time if you meet all of these requirements:\n\nYou were already able to work off campus during your previous studies\nYou have a valid study permit or you applied to extend your study permit before it expired\nYou received written confirmation from your current school that you completed your program\n**You received a letter of acceptance to a new full-time study program at a DLI**\n**You\u2019ll start your new program within 150 calendar days of receiving the confirmation that you completed your previous program**\n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/work-off-campus.html#after\n\nif you want to stay while waiting for admission results you need to have applied for a visitor record but looks like you are past that window and technically overstaying at this point\n\n&gt;&gt; Your study permit will become invalid **90 days after you complete your studies (even before your study permit expiry date)** or on the expiry date of your study permit. If you plan to stay in Canada after your studies, be sure to maintain valid status in Canada.\n\nAS A VISITOR\n\nIf your study permit is going to expire and you want to stay in Canada temporarily as a visitor after you complete your studies, **you need to apply for a visitor record**. You can apply online or by paper from within Canada to change your immigration status to visitor. The application should be submitted **no more than 90 days after program completion**.\n\nOnce you switch to a visitor record, any new application for a study permit or work permit must be made outside of Canada and can be made at the Canadian Consulates in Los Angeles (study permits only), Canadian Consulate in New York (work permits only), or in a visa office that serves your country of citizenship (for both study or work permits).\n\nhttps://students.ok.ubc.ca/career-experience/working-in-canada/staying-in-canada-after-graduation/\n\nedit: sorry for formatting i'm on mobile\n\nalso disclaimer not an immigration consultant, check the links above for further verification",

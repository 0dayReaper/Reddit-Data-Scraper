Ignite also has a $50 voucher for period products, you can sign up here\n\nhttps://ignitestudentlife.com/wellness-security/health-and-wellness/emergency-menstrual-products/\n\nIf you went to orientation, Humber also offers free tutor for any courses you take, the gym is open for every student, and the school also have a pool. I'm not sure what other stuff we can get for free but check out the posters on the boards you'll see in the hallway. Sometimes ignite would post things there that could be very beneficial for students.",

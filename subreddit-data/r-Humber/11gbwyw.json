The other room was like 100 down. \n\nSo it really depends if you get lucky and near the server room. Most rooms have Ethernet also but it was significantly slower and an open network so it's kinda sketchy. \n\nIf you are a gamer just get a decent network card and use that. I played a decent amount of comp games without any issues.",

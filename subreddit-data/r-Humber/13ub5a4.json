I've heard it's difficult to get out into clinical placements cohorts in summer so students arent able to, so wanted to know! Also do humber students get paid for clinical placements at Humber?",

I don\u2019t blame u for asking these questions cause we all ask them - whether here or to our supervisor, so don\u2019t feel bad. All I can say is take the L, try to learn as much as you can, and start saving up for when consolidation rolls around \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udef6 wish someone told me this in advance lol",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! I'm thinking about applying to this program since I want to do a mix of IT and design and it looks like this program is the best option Humber has to offer but I have some concerns. I am worried this sphere is less financially stable and in demand overall than something like Computer Programming. It would be nice to hear about someone's experience with this program.  \n\nAlso, if someone can tell me about the job placement difficulty that would be very helpful. Thanks!",

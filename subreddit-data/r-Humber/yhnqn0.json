    "postText": "I have applied at Humber North for business management program.  It's been 2 weeks and 3-4 days. \n\nI am from India. \n\nThis is my academic profile\n\n93% in 12th grade, commerce stream. With above 90% in economics, accountancy and business studies. (Which i believe are relevant to the program) \nAn overall band 8 in ielts, with no band less than 7.\n\n\n1.Do you think i will get accepted if seats stay available?\n2. How much time it takes for the LOA. \n3. is mathematics required for this course as i have a few friends studying the same course and did not have maths as a subject in 12th grade (just like me) , my agent told me that maths is required. I check on the admissions requirements page for the program, in the international equivalency for indian students section, there is no explicit requirement of maths, but it says atleast 70% in core subjects. \n\nThank You :)",

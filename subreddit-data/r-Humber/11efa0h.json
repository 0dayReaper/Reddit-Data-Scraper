Kept bugging and eventually got it replaced.  \n\n\nPersonally I enjoyed my experience in residence overall but there have definitely been people with problems there.  \n\n\nThis is in reference to North, singles.",

But the ones that aren't taken care of as well are \\*bad\\*.  \n\n\nI've found what I would assume to be used underwear draped over the sink faucet, I've found pubic hair clumped up on the shower stall drain, and I've found what appeared to be like a ziploc bag of urine just sitting in the corner of a shower stall.  \n\n\nDon't just take my word for it, I have it on my instagram highlighted stories. If you want I'll dm you the link",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2019all! I just received my acceptance into the BComm Human Resources Management program! I had a quick question tho that hopefully someone could answer maybe from experience. Now on the admissions page for the program one of the requirements was a gr 12 U math or post-secondary equivalent, now I\u2019m about to graduate from my current program in aug and I do have a math credit - but it\u2019s nursing math and I had called a while ago to see if that would be equivalent to their requirement but I was told it was not. The thing is, on their admissions page it said (and I specifically remember this because it is the only reason I ended up going thru with applying) that people who do not possess the math requirement may still be considered for admission - which brings me to now. I\u2019ve gotten my conditional offer without this math requirement, but it is still showing up as a requirement to my offer in the portal? Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? What does it mean? Do I still need this math requirement even though I received an offer without it???? I\u2019m going to contact admissions about it but I thought I\u2019d shoot my shot and ask here first! Pls help lol &amp; thank u for any responses in advance:)",

But this doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get in. What you should do is complete one of the math courses quickly through TVO ILC. Only $40 for a course. Hope this helps :)",

Otherwise, I think the upgrade course is called RSMT 1000. You can call the registrar's office or the Business school to confirm.",

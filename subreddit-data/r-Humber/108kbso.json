            "comment": "I finished the program 2 years ago, am now a registered licensed technician (currently also doing undergrad in my second year lmao), the pharmacy tech program can have a learning curve if you've got no experience. Also watch out certain classes/labs need a 80% or 90% to pass, during second year you have a math test you get 3 attempts and need to get 100% on. There's also community and hospital placements where you'll have assignments to do while also working. Message me if you have any more questions :) Also the school prepares you well for the licensing exams I passed both PEBC and Jurisprudence on my first try using what I learned from Humber and my own experience as a pharmacy assistant.",

Its like conversions, IV calculations, days supply, compounding math, I can try to find my old workbook for you. Personally I've worked in community pharmacy for 3 year and just started hospital. You really don't use most of the math they teach you. Maybe sometimes a tapering script or knowing how to calculate supply for insulin. Can dm for more questions, happy to answer",

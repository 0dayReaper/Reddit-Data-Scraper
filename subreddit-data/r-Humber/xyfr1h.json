            "comment": "not sure but if you look up TVO ILC schooling they have affordable online classes! It'll take like a month or two to do unfortunately but it's a solution I know of.  \n\n\nAlso I took this class! It's pretty fun all in all but its just not for me. I believe it gets accredited towards one year ONLY FOR NON UNION, so let that help you decide if you want to be an electrician. This course is a good intro, the code stuff is heavy but if you pay attention its fine, just hope you don't get sandy as a teacher. hope that guy retired lmfao. but yeah if you wanna be a union electrician after this, it won't count towards that from what I remember. Just keep that in mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers",

    "postText": "Hi everyone this will be kind of a long post so thank you for your patience.\n\nI want to study at Humber College starting in Fall 2023. I plan to study \"Business Management - Financial Services\" or some program related to especially finance. I am 23 years old and have previous 3-year of university study experience at MIS(Management Information Systems, English, %100 Scholarship) in Turkey. I came to Canada almost 6 months ago and now I am a refugee. I didn't get my PR yet, but I have the \"Refugee Claimant\" document. I'd be so happy if you answer my 3 questions below:\n\n1. Am I eligible to enroll as a domestic student at Humber College?\n2. Can I Transfer my previous credits to Humber?\n3. I saw Humber's name on the OSAP List but I didn't see the program's name. If anyone getting OSAP, can you tell me if is OSAP accepted for business-related programs?\n\nThank you so much for all of your answers!\n\n#",

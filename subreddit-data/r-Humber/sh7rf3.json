    "postText": "I'm graduating from York University in October with a degree in English and I plan to enroll in Humber for a graduate certificate in Supply Chain Management. The admission requirement for Humber's graduate certificate program simply states a bachelor's degree. So, am I all set? Will they check my grades in uni? I would really appreciate some clarification and more specifically from people who pursued and completed graduate certificates from Humber. (PS: we are living in a time where graduate certificates are very popular and more useful than ever!)",

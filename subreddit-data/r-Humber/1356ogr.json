    "postText": "Hey guys I'm kind of overwhelmed right now because I took 3 years off after graduating high school to work and have forgotten everything I learned about going to college. I have applied for computer programming and am just wondering if I can go to university for computer science after graduating . Could I do that or do I have to complete the required high school courses to be accepted ( I took all applied/college level courses in high school) . Sorry if this is a dumb question I'm just really really lost",

If you need high school credits it\u2019ll be easier and cheaper just to retake them to get better grades and then apply to some uni\u2019s \n\nI didn\u2019t have university credits in high school so I went to humber and got a diploma then intended to go to university but they still required university high school credits in spite of the diploma. \n\nWould\u2019ve saved like 1.5 years by just retaking high school courses and going straight to Uni. I did get some credits for the diploma at humber but a 2 year program amounted to less then a full years course load at Uni. \n\nWith that all said, humber does have a lot of programs that go from college to Uni so if they have a pipeline from their school to a Uni you like you should check out there stuff",

            "comment": "Can't speak for Comp Sci specifically but I assume the transferable credits are as strict as the accounting program. When I was looking for universities to transfer to after completing my 3 year accounting diploma, most credible schools would only offer a consideration of around 1 years worth of credit (ie. 3 + 3 years total). I would recommend taking high school courses and applying for university directly - you will save a lot of time.",

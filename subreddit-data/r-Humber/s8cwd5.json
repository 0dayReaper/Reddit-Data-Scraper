I\u2019m wondering how\u2019s the overall environment condition of the newly constructed IGS building and the most important is what you\u2019ve learned from the program gives a solid backup or not thus can be applied to further co-op/placements?",

            "comment": "I am a fellow BIA student who'll be joining IGS for summer intake.\nSo this particular course is fairly new, so getting data related to placement/co-op is impossible. Moreover the course started during the pandemic so that messes up the data for the first intake who joined this course (it started the first time in Summer 2020)\nAnyways, the course in itself is pretty good. It teaches you stuff like SQL, Java, Python which are indeed in demand. \nI currently work as a recruiter for an Canadian staffing firm so I can attest that Business Analytics is in demand right now. Almost every company is looking for BA's.\nNow it boils down to what you want to do. Business analytics, in itself, is very wide. You can become an IT Business Analyst, SCM BA, QA BA, Functional BA etc. Although the course itself covers a lot, you may need to learn other languages/tools to enter the field you want to be in.\nHope it helps.",

It's not impossible to graduate, a lot of programs have this pre-requisite in other colleges as well. And college will provide support to find a work placement.\nI didn't choose IGS. I was actually supposed to start in January 2021 in Lakeshore but due to visa related issues i wasn't able to so i deferred to May intake and Lakeshore doesn't have this course in May. \nThe campus completely depends on what you're looking for in Canada. If, as an international student, you want to pay your next year fees and don't really care about the campus life but still want education, IGS might be for you. But if you are looking for campus and other amenities, IGS isn't for you at all.",

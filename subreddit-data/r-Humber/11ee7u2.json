    "postText": "I dropped out of my second semester in Humber last January and returned to my home country due to personal reasons. I withdrew my funds but did not request an authorized leave of absence because I was not aware that I needed to do so before taking a semester leave (which is a very careless mistake).\n\nI want to return now and study in Humber for my 2nd semester this coming May 2023. My student visa has not yet expired. Can I still use it, return back to Humber and study again without violating any immigration laws, or do I need to apply for a new one since it may no longer be valid after dropping out of my college?",

    "postText": "I've attended Humber for two years now and the strike has severely impacted the Fall semester for me, as it has no doubt affected many other students.  I\u2019m pretty upset about the strike, but my frustration isn\u2019t focused at the faculty.  Unions typically only strike when they\u2019ve exhausted all other options and their grievances have fallen upon deaf ears.\nWhat\u2019s really getting my goat right now is what Humber is doing for the students that have been impacted by the strike.  The colleges are rolling out a revised academic timetable that doesn\u2019t seem to take into consideration the well-being of their students.  We\u2019ve been out of class for a month, do they honestly expect when they finally come to an accord with the faculty that the students are going to be able to jump right back into where they left off?  Sure, you can read your textbooks during the strike, but if your program focuses on practical labs, how exactly are you supposed to keep those skills sharp?  The reality is that most classes will need to ramp back up, and that could take a week or two depending on the course.  Also, the revised academic time table is now impacting the Winter Semester, with classes starting later in January and reading week being cancelled.  How exactly is this going to benefit students?\nThe reality of the matter is the colleges don\u2019t want to give back any money to any of the students that have been impacted by the strike.  And if they need to compromise our educations to ensure they don't have to pay out, so be it.\n",

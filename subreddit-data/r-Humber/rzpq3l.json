    "postText": "I'm currently in a process of applying for college applications. To give you a better view let me explain the situation. The course I'm interested in is Advertisement and Marketing Communications - Management. Sheridan offers 2 year diploma and 3 year (adv) diploma, the only difference is that you get to have field placement in ur last sem for 3 year adv diploma. \n\nAlternatively, Humber offers the same course(2 years) with field placement. I know this is an advantage in itself but I want to be sure in terms of future also. I mean the diploma from which college would be beneficial for me in terms of opportunities?? Between the both, employers prefer which college when it comes to Industry/field my course is related to??\n\nHelp me...this is making me stressed out!!\n\n(P.S - hope I'm not breaking any community rules!!)",

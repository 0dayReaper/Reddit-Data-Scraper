The germs are spreading and people are touching it. It\u2019s gonna spread like wildfire on campus. It probably already has, just no symptoms yet. \n\nColleges and universities in the GTA should have suspended classes this week if they wanted to get ahead of it. But hey, I guess the economy is more important.",

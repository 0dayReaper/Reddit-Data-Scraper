    "postText": "Researchers at York University are conducting a study which examines the working conditions and pathways to permanent residency of individuals migrating to Canada to work temporarily under the International Mobility Program (IMP). As part of this research, we are seeking to interview individuals with current or recent past experience migrating to Canada under the **Spouse Open Work Permit Program.** These permits are generally available to spouses of international students and skilled workers.\n\nInterviews will be conducted via Zoom and will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked questions pertaining to their gender, source country, and age, and, if employed, questions will include occupation, industry, wages or income, hours worked, and other conditions of employment. The project aims to shed light on the conditions fostered by international mobility programs as well as to improve workplace protections and employment standards enforcement to benefit workers migrating to Canada for employment. \n\nEligibility to participate:\n\no 18+ years of age\n\no A current or past Spouse Open Work Permit visa holder \n\no Experience working in Canada while holding a Spouse Open Work Permit\n\nAll information supplied during the research will be held in confidence. Participants' name will not appear in any report or publication of the research. If you are interested in participating, please send an email to [impinterviews2022@gmail.com](mailto:impinterviews2022@gmail.com). Thank you!!",

    "postText": "Hello there!  I applied to a graduate certificate program at Humber, and I'm a little confused at the moment.  My status on MyHumber in the Applicant Applied Programs tab lists my offer status as final offer, however I haven't received an email regarding admission and my status on the Ontario Colleges website has not updated indicating I have been accepted.  Do you think it is a glitch or do you think a decision has been made and an email will be coming?",

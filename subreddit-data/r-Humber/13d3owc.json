I explained to them what were the factors that causes me to fail I took full accountability and I always provided them a plan that I\u2019m going to follow to ensure my success. And I did through a zoom call.",

Humber will look at your most recent post secondary grades so whatever your average was during your last year at Seneca. Your best bet is to take the year off and reapply to Seneca and explain to them how your circumstances have changed and why you will be successful in the future.",

Everything is a fight, people are combative and not helpful and anyone who isn\u2019t, is powerless.  \n\nIn our program we don\u2019t get to see what we got wrong on tests, why?  Because it\u2019s more important to not \u201cjeopardize the academic integrity of tests\u201d than to allow students to learn from their mistakes by knowing what questions they got wrong.   So basically they don\u2019t want to have to write new questions every year despite making over $100,000 a year and that is more important than true learning opportunities.\n\nThis is just one of many complaints I have.",

Also it's not because they don't want to make new tests, it's to prevent cheating and to prevent students from sharing course work online.",

And the whole excuse that it prevents \u201ccheating\u201d and sharing a test online is the excuse used so they don\u2019t have to write new tests.  If you release the test AFTER all sections have completed, then there\u2019s no possibility of cheating as all students have written the test.  If after this someone chooses to be dishonest and post their test online, well, that can be overcome by writing new tests each year!  \n\nSo really it comes down to them not wanting to put the work in to write new tests.   Cheating and whatever is an excuse.\n\nI was at U of T previously and they allowed you access to everything (albeit with varying rules), even final exams.  So saying that everyone does it, is not correct and doesn\u2019t change the fact that those profs and schools who do it are just trying to not have to put on the work of refreshing tests regularly.\n\nAnd as for them technically not having to meet with you and review your test\u2026you are probably correct but if a prof cared more about your learning than their convenience this would be the very least they could do to help you learn from your mistakes.",

They are extremely unhelpful especially towards international students and when you try to approach them, they make you feel stupid by talking to you in a condescending manner. They have very high expectations (expect you to know everything all the time) but will purposely provide ambiguous instructions.",

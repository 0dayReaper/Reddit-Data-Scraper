    "postText": "Hi all, I\u2019m wondering if any of you have gone through the same situation as I am now. Basically, I\u2019m planning to apply to university and ouac is asking me for my Humber student number for transcript application. It won\u2019t let me type the N-number but instead it\u2019s asking me for just the numbers. Would the numbers suffice? For example, instead of N012345, it\u2019s just 012345?",

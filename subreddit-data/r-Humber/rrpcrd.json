Some say that 2 years of computer programming is not enough for the job. I am trying to figure out if it is for me or not since I have no previous programming knowledge.",

If you are an international there is a added problem that not getting coop job might mean you sit for a semester without doing anything which will complicate immigration matters.\n \nYou will basically have to put in a lot of work outside of school to make yourself more employable once you graduate but there is also a huge luck and personality component to getting a job.\n\nMy advice is pick a popular stack like MERN sometime during your first year and dedicate as much time as possible to it outside of school while still passing classes, in 2 years I think you can be a decent developer. Also sometime in year 2 start looking at the developer communities in Toronto, go to meetups etc.",

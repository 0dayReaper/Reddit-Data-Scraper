    "postText": "I have a couple of questions for people living at residence right now since ive been seeing a lot of mix opinions and cant really find an updated video or tour for the North Campius residence. Anyways, here are the questions if someone can answer any of them :)\n\n1. How is the dining room? In general the food options,  im buying the basic plan for food.\n2. Are the bathrooms in general clean?\n3. How do they go about the cleaning of the rooms? Like would I have to do the cleaning myself (i dont mind it haha)\n4. Can I buy things like a rice maker, coffee machine etc and keep them in my room?\n5. Are the desks big enough? Or is it better to study somewhere else?\n6. How is the community? is it easy to make friends? or is it pretty lonely?\n\nI know ths questions are kinda odd but I literally cant find the answers anywhere lmao",

            "comment": "Lived in residence for two years, hoping to get in next year:\n\n1. Dining hall is alright.  Food options are not as great/varied as other colleges/unis, but it does the job.  You'll definitely get bored if you're vegetarian/vegan etc.  Also it's way too expensive for what it is.  I bought the basic meal plan and still had to load up $500+ after to suffice for the year (your mileage may vary or w/e).\n2. Bathrooms are generally clean, they get cleaned once a day.  Of course, it depends on how people on your residence floor treat it (e.g. my floor's bathroom had a stall door missing because people kept taking it off.  how does that even happen?)\n3. You clean your own room.  You can borrow a vacuum cleaner from the front desk (free of charge).\n4. You can't really have any electronics/appliances in your room unless they have an automatic shutoff.  Kettles and mini-fridge are fine, for other things you'd have to ask residence.  I think you're allowed to use hot plates in the common rooms but not in your own room.  Suite-style rooms may have exceptions, idk.\n5. The desks are large enough for most things.  I could fit both my laptop and A3 paper with room for a desk fan and other stuff.  You should get a power strip btw cuz there aren't many power outlets\n6. Community is generally fine but that really depends on every individual.  Me and others on my floor felt comfortable leaving our doors unlocked (for short periods).  I am a bit of a loner myself so I can't say it's easy to make friends but people generally get along ok.  There's also a Discord server for each residence year if that's more your thing.\n\nI hope this helps - if you have any more questions feel free to reply here or DM me.",

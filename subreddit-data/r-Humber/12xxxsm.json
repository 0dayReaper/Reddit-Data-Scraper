    "postText": " There needs to be a stop to how Humber College and Proctortrack do things for our future careers!\u00a0\n\nFrom issues like Proctortrack affecting the results of exams to whether or not our exams are even being marked correctly. Why are we paying hundreds of dollars for courses that we have to be forced to re-take? Why is there a limit to how long we can learn? Why can't I have an exam review in order to learn from my mistakes? Why am I receiving threats from Proctortrack about my room when it was approved already?\n\nThe concerns seem to be endless!\nhttps://www.change.org/ChangeForEducation",

    "postText": "My wife will he attending Humber North this semester and looking for a studio, one bedroom apartment, or hopefully anyone willing to share with a couple. I\u2019ve seen a lot of postings for single-person rooms. How can I go and find rooms for us as a couple? We don\u2019t know the area well, but we\u2019re willing to be flexible with any promising opportunities.",

            "comment": "It honestly just depends on the landlord, unfortunately the area can be a little frustrating for renting (at least so far in my experience) so I'd suggest just mass emailing/messaging/calling. There are a few apartments nearby but it honestly just depends on your budget I think last time I looked it was between $1500-$2500. Otherwise you are likely to be in a house with 4-8 other people but there are usually master bedrooms available with their own private washroom which is probably preferable as a couple. If you have any questions feel free to message me!",

    "postText": "NOTE: If you\u2019re considering doing a co-op program at Humber, you probably want to read this post. \n\nMy program has a co-op requirement. After lots of applications I finally landed a co-op opportunity last month. I informed my program coordinator and submitted the paperwork. The school told me they were going to take 2-3 days to process it and I informed my co-op supervisor that he would get an email from my school in a few days. Humber took significantly longer than that to process the paperwork and barely even responded to my followup emails. Every few days I would email my co-op supervisor and apologize for the delay. Eventually, many follow up emails later, Humber was finally done processing the paperwork and sent it to my co-op supervisor to sign, but it was too late. My co-op supervisor informed me that he no longer had the time to train me and hire me as a co-op.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I\u2019m concerned that I\u2019m not going to graduate because of this.",

If your program is part of the \"school of social and community services (SSCS)\" theN I would get in touch with Corina Ivory, who is the placement manager for all of the SSCS.  I had a problem with my placement and Humber ALSO didn't want to take responsibility, essentially saying that things that were beyond my control were my fault.  So I went through an appeal process to try and work out a solution with Corina and eventually reached one",

You wrote them and pleaded with them, theyre the reason you didn't get it and now you are owed restitution. They re the reason you missed the opportunity and now they need to make it right.

    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nI\u2019m mid 20\u2019s with a bachelor of commerce, looking to switch careers towards something more technical like a system admin, IT analyst, etc. and this program seems to be a good bridge option, especially considering co-op is a possibility. I\u2019m hoping that having a bachelors degree and years of tech-company project management work experience will hopefully make me more competitive for a co-op position.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to self-learn programming and study for A+ certs but I always get sidetracked by work/life, so I think formally educating myself in this field may be my best bet (not interested in doing software engineering or anything like that at this point, I\u2019m really looking for system admin-like jobs).\n\nIf anyone is currently enrolled/has competed the program, I\u2019m wondering: \n- how competitive was the co-op process? Does Humber do a decent job of helping students secure co-op work? \n- if you completed the program, were you reasonably competitive in the job market for IT-related entry-level/mid-level positions? \n- are there any courses that are particularly challenging that I should look out for? \n\nI\u2019d appreciate anyone\u2019s advice/knowledge!",

            "comment": "Based on my program (computer engineering)You will learn most of what you need for the A+ and CCNA exam but it depends on the teacher what material they use (some use A+/CCNA practice questions for exams and others stick to the curriculum). CompSystemTech will go more in depth in I.T stuff than we did. Secondly, I didn\u2019t do co-op but what I\u2019ve heard from others is that they don\u2019t help you look for a job they just touch up your resume. You\u2019ll be fine though cause you have prior experience.",

If you need those, shoot me a DM! I have a Kijiji ad, a Facebook marketplace ad, and also posted in Humber used and sell textbooks group if you wanna go check it out. It's under the program title.",

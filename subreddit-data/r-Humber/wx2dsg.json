    "postText": "Slightly strange title, I know. My name is Matt (male, 26 y.o.), and I am a bog-standard white guy from Northern Ontario living at the Lakeshore Campus Residence; in fact, I moved in yesterday. I am here for eight months, I have no friends (literally zero), and I am attempting to be less anti-social. I have been trying on and off (without the proper motivation) to learn Japanese since the height of the pandemic had forced me to stay indoors, yet I never had the opportunity to focus on it due to post-secondary studies and work.\n\nWell, I am looking for people who speak (natively or otherwise) Japanese that may want a friend while simultaneously helping them (me) learn and appreciate Japan's language and culture. If you do not speak Japanese and want a friend, I guess that is cool too. However, I am still looking for someone who is willing to be patient and to motivate me to learn this beautiful language.\n\nSo, reply to this post or send me a message: it would be an honour to meet and converse with you.",

Most career paths in the technology field are pretty well paying so there's not much concern there as long as you know how to determine when you're being lowballed.  \n\n\nIt's not really a decision anyone can make but you. You're the only one that knows where you'll be happy.",

I personally enjoyed the program and was hired by one of the professors upon graduation. Obviously my experience won't line up with everyone's experience but I'm fairly certain most of the graduates find jobs in the field pretty soon after based on my peers linkedin updates lol.",

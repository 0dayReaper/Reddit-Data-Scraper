I didn't know they had already sent out offers, I hope I'm not too late. Also, for Seneca, did you receive instructions on the applicant profile and resume submission ?\n\nSorry for asking so many questions, just really stressed out. \n\nAnd what i've heard, both programs are really good, but one key diff is that Humber is online so no commute is needed but Seneca is in person as of now",

Admission advisors are available via phone. \n\nYes, even for seneca they should send u an email with slideroom information. There are 6 or\n5 questions u have to answer (not video) and then resume. For seneca I received the slideroom email after 1-2 days but for Humber it took like a week. \n\nYeah both programs are really good! But I think Humber has a mandatory coop option whereas seneca it\u2019s optional as in u don\u2019t really get coop but u ask them and I think it\u2019s based on your gpa during the program. \n\nI hope you get in as well!

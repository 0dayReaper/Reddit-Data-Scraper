It won't be anything complicated but you should think about it, you should see some movie beforehand and just analyse it, they want to test how much you know about film in general so, good luck! \n\nPD: Also, think about *why* you chose film and tv program.",

If you get accepted please tell me right away!! I wish you good luck.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I am going to North campus in the fall for a post graduate degree and am so lost on how to pay since everything is due in July instead of September (awful). \n\nSo I have Osap ($7100) and I have a student line of credit with about $5000 left on it and then the rest I am paying out of pocket. However I am locked out of my student line of credit until I give my enrolment for Humber as they have that I graduated from my previous uni and obviously I can\u2019t give them my verification of enrolment until after I register for classes which is after payment is due. \n\nI know there is a payment plan options but the Humber website is very not useful and doesn\u2019t say how to apply for this so does anyone know how? As well with Osap, how does this work with tuition being due in July? Also I am living in res and all res fees are due July 18 for fall. The email says there is a residence provincial aid instalment form but I can\u2019t find any info on what that is and the link for it the residence portal doesn\u2019t exist for me. \n\nI\u2019m also looking to get a parking pass but again can\u2019t find any info on the website for when this is available. \n\nI have called twice and emailed a few times and always get told to check the website but I can\u2019t find the info I\u2019m looking for. So if anyone has any answers I\u2019d appreciate it!",

I applied for OSAP (god it\u2019s been years since I had to apply when I was in Uni and the system is garbage lol), but my funds are still being calculated for OSAP but tuition is due this month? So I have no idea what\u2019s happening in that regard... I assume they\u2019ll release it sooner but honestly not sure?",

                    "comment": "I called the school Monday and was on the phone for about 2 hours being bounced around to try and understand. The financial aid office was awful and very not helpful (also rude) and they took 20 minutes to even take my call. Between the residence office and the register office I think I got an answer. As long as you have submitted everything you can for osap this is like a promise to the school you will pay and will not be locked out of registration for classes. Once your osap has been applied to the school, you\u2019ll get an email (maybe nobody seemed to know if they will notify you or you just have to keep checking) if your osap didn\u2019t cover all fees and what the difference is that you have to pay and when it\u2019s due. So I\u2019m risking it and not paying anything until my osap goes through and hopefully I can still register for classes. Absolute garbage system I don\u2019t know why they would make stuff due in July instead of September",

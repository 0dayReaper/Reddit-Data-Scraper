    "postText": "Hey!\n\nI am interested in pursuing a nursing career. I will be completing my Bachelor of Science degree. I was wondering if anyone who has done the Nursing - Second Entry Preparation, Bachelor of Science at Humber can offer any insight on the program? https://healthsciences.humber.ca/programs/bachelor-of-science-nursing-second-entry-preparation.html\n\nDo you receive a degree from Humber or UnB? Is this basically an accelerated program for nursing? \n\nThe website presents this program almost like a preparation for a nursing program so I am slightly confused. \n\nAlso, are the credits from this program transferable, for example, if I chose to transfer to another school for nursing, would I be able to transfer those credits over? \n\nIn general, how is the program? Do you find it easier than going through undergrad?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm currently in the UNB-Humber 2nd entry nursing program. \n\nI can give you an insight to the program. Students who are admitted to the preparatory semester will have to do a semester of taking these courses during the fall (Anatomy, statistics, Microbiology, Psychology, and Pathophysiology). If you already did those courses in your previous undergrad, those can be transferable which means you would only need to do courses you don't have credits on. But take note, you would need to have at least a mark of 74% in all of those courses to be admitted to the actual program which starts during the winter term and will last for another 2 years, including summer. Overall, the length of doing nursing in second entry in Humber is (4 months of prep semester + 2 years of the actual program= 2 years and 4 months).\n\nHere's the brochure for the program:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1NT3oTPj2ZDIwj\\_deQhMaGawWEuWs5R/view?usp=sharing\n\n*Do you receive a degree from Humber or UnB? Is this basically an accelerated program for nursing?* I believe that our cohort is the last year to receive a degree in UNB since Humber will have their own second entry program next year. Don't worry, it's most likely that next year's cohort is similar to the UNB program. Yes, it's still an accelerated program for Nursing. The program will still lead you to a Bachelor of Nursing which will allow you to be an RN. And just because it's college, doesn't mean you wont qualify for grad schools in Nursing. Take note, you'll still receive a Bachelor of Nursing which is equivalent to a university degree. You can inquire to various grad schools if that will ease your mind about them accepting Humber BN graduates.  \n\n*Also, are the credits from this program transferable, for example, if I chose to transfer to another school for nursing, would I be able to transfer those credits over?*  And in regards to this question, if you plan on applying to Humber then switching to a different school, please don't do that. Getting into a second entry program is already competitive enough, that is just an insult to those people who are trying to get in. And I believe, each school has their own second entry/Accelerated Nursing curriculum, even if you get admitted to any accelerated nursing programs, you won't be able to transfer those credits except for general courses maybe like pathophysiology. \n\n*In general, how is the program? Do you find it easier than going through undergrad?* So far, the preparatory semester is easier than any of the classes I had at York. Hopefully, next winter term will be easy as well. \n\nHumber has a really high NCLEX pass rate, low drop out rates compared to other nursing schools, and offers 1400 clinical hours.\n\nBtw, I got these cool stuff from them as well\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DLg4Hv-G9UmRlqX4310mfno7TymNkG9J?usp=sharing",

    "postText": "So guys, due to the visa delays I couldn't receive my visa on time and since my program availability is only for September 23' I just want to know what is the way ahead. I requested for the deferral already but they are saying that it will require a new application. So does this mean that I will have to go with the same process once again? Is there a possibility that I will get rejected?",

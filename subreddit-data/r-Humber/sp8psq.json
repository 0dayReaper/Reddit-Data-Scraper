Were the courses informative? Was the coursework and assignment-load manageable? What sorts of assignments/evaluations were there?\n\nHow was the process of finding a work placement? \n\nHave you found work in the music industry since finishing the program? \n\nWould you recommend someone take the program?\n\nTIA!",

    "postText": "Does anyone else feel like we are getting really poor quality of online classes? During these past few weeks it seems like our profs are phoning it in. I get its unusual but they had a week to prepare. Even before this situation taking on online classes was usually most of the time teaching yourself. The professors would just post readings to do not even make the effort to do voice over or anything.\n\nIs it just me? What do you guys think?",

You have to understand that the median age of professors means that they are not the most comfortable with the technology. I literally popped in a session early to work with one of my professors on getting screen sharing working so that we could work on videos. They mentioned that they preferred zoom compared to blackboard, so it's a learning curve for all of us. My program is a business program, so my expereince could be different.  \n\n\nAll the professors have been as engaging as they usually are, so that's a plus.\n\nBeing part of PALS, we have had to actually use our online system, it as glitchy as blackboard collaborate ultra, but it's what we've got. It's been a learning experience for sure, having to tutor student learners online, so I can say that 1 week isn't enough preperation time.",

Even then it was just an hour of talking and then we all left. As for the other classes they just released all the powerpoints for the rest of the semester and said \"good luck,\" only giving an update if they had to. All in all, I think they used that week of planning to sit with their thumbs up their asses",

    "postText": "I want to apply for this program for the 2023 September term, I am at UTM in my final year and will graduate this semester. My question is, does this program look at your GPA or have a required GPA to get in? All I see in the requirements for this program is \"To be eligible for admission, you must possess the following: A bachelor\u2019s degree\". Also, are there any Post-Admission Requirements as well and does anyone know when the deadline is to apply for 2023 September term.\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "So long as there are open spots in the program, you can apply any time up to September 2023. I forget when the cutoff is for Fall entry, but the program does accept late admissions. For example, I started this January, but I didn't get accepted into the program until the last week of December 2022 to start January 2023. It was a mad rush, I don't recommend that for anyone. Lol. \n\nAs for degrees, they'll accept ANY Bachelors Degree. There's a wide variety of backgrounds in my program from business, law, to Healthcare, social services and fine arts (I think the guy has his Bachelors in music? Can't remember). \n\nFeel free to pm me for more info, but I think you'll be ok with what you've got right now. \ud83d\ude0a Good luck!!!",

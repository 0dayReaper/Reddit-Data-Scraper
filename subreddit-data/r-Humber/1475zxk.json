    "postText": "Hello,\n\nLike many international students applying to Canadian schools, I was eager to study in Canada but didn't think I could compete for admission to Master's programs. As a result, I applied to Graduate Certificate programs at colleges in Toronto.\n\nTo my surprise, despite having a decent profile, I was rejected by all the schools I applied to (Seneca, Humber, George Brown, etc.). For a moment, I lost hope that I would be able to study abroad anywhere.\n\nHowever, four months later, I was accepted into my dream program at one of the top 30 universities in the world, which is located in Europe.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience to encourage others not to lose hope and to pursue their dreams. Wishing you all the best of luck! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb",

However, it depends on where you are from, so you have to check if your nationality requires it or not. In my case, my nationality requires it, but I did my Bachelors in Europe, where it's not required for that European country. Still, they treated me as if I got my qualifications from my home country. It's a very inefficient system.\n\nI haven't done any WES assessment, and I don't remember if it was mandatory for the application.\n\nI uploaded all my documents and even submitted merit certificates, which are not required, but it was no use.\n\nIt's okay! Feel free to ask me any other questions. Just a notice, I felt the same stress and enthusiasm in you as I had months ago. I advise you not to stress regarding Humber. You will find a place that knows your value anyway! Best of luck.",

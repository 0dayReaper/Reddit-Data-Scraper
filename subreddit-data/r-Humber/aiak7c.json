I did learn lots, but not enough to justify coming to Humber tbh.\n\nI'm in Theatre Production. Aha",

I'm already in debt and I don't even know if it will secure me a job that I don't even know if I want anymore. At the moment were literally learning stuff we've already learned and its gonna continue into fourth year. I'm getting nothing out of this anymore and it just makes me feel so down everyday. All I do lately is stress about college and I don't want it to consume my life anymore but the damage is irreparable at this point.",

My cert. will be good for absolutely nothing but theatre, and Humber sucked the fun out of working on productions. I can't go somewhere else for business though, thanks to the OSAP cuts\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

Also just came from high school haha\n\nAt least my program is only one year, but I'm not really sure what I want to do after  I finish since I'm clearly not cut out for a career in design :/ \n\nI guess my question is... Are you planning on finishing the program and doing a career in theatre anyway or are you gonna explore other options once you're done?\n\nI hope this reply isn't too late lol",

I do want to explore what scripted theatre is like, because Humber teaches devised, and I think it may be the reason I can't stand the program. Although, I am nervous that I have barely any knowledge, and I am about to enter the professional field.  I'd also like to re-explore mechanics, and I have a fair amount of experience in it. ",

    "postText": "SO I applied to Humber Jan 27th 2023 and for some reason I haven't received a username and password. I tried contacting Humber through the contact form and the enquiry emails but they all have been unhelpful and couldn't find my login details. \n\nToday I finally received a mail from Humber Global saying my application is reprocessed because of payment failure. However I received a payment receipt AND the status says approved. Has this happened to any of you? I'm in dire need of help. I cannot access MyHumber and now I'm ensure if my application has even made it into their system.",

This is so unfair considering I'm now put at a disadvantage since applications are always first come first serve and it could cost me my admission. \n\nAny advice would be helpful",

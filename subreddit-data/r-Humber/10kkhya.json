THANK YOU!",

            "comment": "They don't. It is the students responsibility to find an opportunity for themselves. I spoke to the Work Integrated Learning Program Administrator regarding this same. Their response\n\n\"To clarify, the Work-Integrated Learning component of the program is student-driven, in that Humber does not place students with specific employers but rather, students are expected to search and explore relevant industry opportunities based on their own interests within their program of study. That said, students are required to enrol in a Field Experience preparation course called Professional Practice which provides students with the tools to be successful in their search. The topics surround things like Resume/Cover Letter building, creating an online profile, mock interviews, job search tactics and more. Our team offers support and shares opportunities and resources with students but it is ultimately the responsibility of each student to spearhead their search.\n\n\nFor example, if you decided that you wanted to return to Sony and gain additional experience there, you could do so. Once you secure an opportunity, you would submit an approval form to our team for review and approval. The guidelines and terms for approval will all be shared in Professional Practice but ultimately, your experience needs to align with the program and program learning outcomes \u2013 you can find the learning outcomes on Humber\u2019s Post Production program webpage.\"",

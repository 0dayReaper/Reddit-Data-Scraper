    "postText": "My friend has recently enrolled at Humber College for the May intake and will be flying to Canada on April 19th. He is from India and has concerns about presenting his **birth certificate** and obtaining medical insurance. He is unsure if he needs to present his birth certificate upon arrival or if there are further steps to follow. Unfortunately, his current birth certificate has several errors, including incorrect date of birth, name, and place, and it would take a significant amount of time to get it fixed. As for **medical insurance**, he's not sure if he needs to obtain it before entering Canada. Any help regarding these matters would be highly appreciated.",

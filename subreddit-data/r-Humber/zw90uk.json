    "postText": "Hi guys! I am a grade 12 student that is super interested in becoming a licensed electrician here in Ontario. I really want to do the Humber college electrician apprentice, I just don\u2019t know what exactly to apply to and whether I can start early or not. I am finishing my school year in June as a grade 12 student. I have more than enough credits to finish a semester early. My only problem is grade 12 religion since I go to a catholic high school and I need it to graduate so I\u2019ll see how that goes. I would also like to know if taking the Electrician Pre-Apprenticeship program  benefits me and then doing the electrician apprenticeship. If it does, how would I proceed?\n\nI imagine i first have to apply for the electrician apprenticeship program and then somehow apply for the pre-electrician apprenticeship program. But how I would I apply to the pre-apprenticeship because it doesn\u2019t give me the option to do so when filling my college application. When would I also write the test for the pre-apprenticeship program? I have so much going through my head right now. Thanks for reading.",

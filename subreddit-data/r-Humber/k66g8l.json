    "postText": "**PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING BEFORE DM'ING ME QUESTIONS**\n\nI've had a few people dm me personally in regards to whats on the exam. I've made [this](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=16vZpzJPNjOtyt09bBncbILJijVZ8MMgo) folder to help anyone out for the exam's biology and chemistry portion, assuming most people aren't gonna buy the recommended book (I didn't even read the whole thing tbh) to prioritize expenses on essential needs. As of the day this is posted, I will not have the chemistry portion done, it will be uploaded in a few days.\n\nDISCLAIMER: the notes are in cursive, reflected off of what I studied for last year's entrance exam, and what I've studied at Durham's pre-health program. The subject matter may have changed for the upcoming exam, so do not use this as a full guideline for what's going to be on the exam. This is meant to be a study tool.\n\nEDIT: I've made a bunch of flashcards on Quizlet if anyone needs them! Just find the respective document in the folder with the links. Chem will be uploaded soon!\n\nEDIT 2: Finally finished written notes if anyone needs and both chem and bio have quizlets based on the subject matter I wrote in my notes (in case if you can't read cursive)! Good luck to everyone taking the test\\~\n\n**INFORMATIVE EDIT 3**: Just for anyone who is taking any tests last min, or for future reference, here's a very generalized list *(based on what I remember, SPECIFICALLY for Humber, this exam is subject to change)* of what's on the exam.\n\n**English Essay**: Simple \"why or why not?\" type question (this could be different). Around 1h and 30 mins. \n\nMy advice: Practice questions from previous EQAO exams for grade 12 English if you feel the need to practice writing efficiency.\n\n**Biology**: 30 questions, multiple-choice, 4 options, around 30 mins. \n\nMy advice: Write out full notes based on the fundamentals of basic Biology, and quiz yourself with quizlets (not just my own) until you're confident. Topics I covered in my notes can be found in my quizlet respectively.\n\n**Chemistry**: 30 questions multiple choice, 4 options, around 30 mins. \n\nMy advice: Same as Biology.\n\n**Math**: 45 questions, multiple-choice, 4 options, around 45 mins. Mainly basic arithmetic that includes a lot of decimals. \n\nMy advice: practice mental math, khan academy practice questions.\n\nStudying aside, please book your exam early as possible; especially before the expected date for post-secondary submissions are due.\n\n**Common questions:**\n\nWhat topics should I expect for the science portion?\n- please refer off my notes or quizlet\n\nDid you use any study material?\n- the book recommended by Humber and study notes from Bar Charts inc.\n\nHow soon can I book my test?\n- as soon as you get your admissions email\n\nHow do I book my test?\n- there should be an email reminder from Humber with a link to book your test as soon as you log into MyHumber. please call Humber if you're having trouble.\n\n**Final edit**\n\nSince people have been asking what exactly I'd suggest to help study for biology and chemistry, I'll just leave it here. I must warn those again who are taking the test later than the Fall 2021 entry that the test may have altered to fit new prerequisites in the future of the program. Again, all the best to those who are applying for Humber RPN!!\n\nI suggest the following:\n\nHOAE book (recommended by Humber)\n- Biology units A through D\n- Chemistry units A through C, E through G, and lightly on unit H to revise the pH scale and buffers\n\nCrash course Playlists (Youtube)\n- Biology Playlist episodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 (for cells and cellular function), 27, 28, 30, 31 (to cover human anatomy questions)\n- Chemistry Playlist episodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 30 (episode 30 to help memorize gas laws and its respective relationships- direct vs indirect)\n\nBarcharts study guides\n- Biology vol 1 (titled \"Biology)\n- Chemistry vol 1 (titled \"Chemistry)",

It's very similar to the essay portion of the EQAO tests you may have taken in the past. From what I recall, there's only the essay for English.\n\nYou can probably find these study tools called \"quick study\" by Bar charts inc. I've used the first Biology pamphlet and the first Chemistry pamphlet to study for the exam and in my previous program. You can either by it off Amazon or take some time finding a free pdf somewhere online. Good luck!",

I should mention again that I've been in a pre health program prior to my exam, so the knowledge found on the exam is very similar to the basics/first sem curriculum. \n\nDepending on your prefered method of studying, if you find reading segments/specific topics of a subject followed by questions related to that info, then sure, the book is a great choice. If not, don't waste your money; rely on other free sources. You can find videos (ie. Crash course) to help refresh with great visuals and use my quizlet to ensure you're in the right direction. Finding pre health notes in StuDocs also helps too if you prefer to read.\n\nHope this helps!",

It has practice questions and has enough depth of a certain definition or topic to help understand and answer the exam questions. It also comes with 10 questions each subject in the respective sciences so that portion helped me a bit. But if you're already familiar with the topics in relative depth, just spare your money and use the extra time to look for free resources.\nAnd lastly if you can't read my cursive (and I know no one does I'm outdated lol) I basically covered the main subjects in term-definition form in my quizlet. Whatever I had from my prehealth program's first sem and from my exam notes is found there.\n\nFor Math just practice basic arithmetic with decimals, percent and fraction equations on khan academy till you feel confident. \n\nHope that helps!!\n\nEdit: look at Studocs and find HOAE exam notes, the exam isn't as bad as HOAE but it's pretty much based on that.",

I just got into FMTV and I'm now starting to think about what will be right for me, so if there is anyone here in or previously in this program that could give me some insight that would be helpful!\n\n- I have already done a university degree and am 23 - what is the mix of people out of high school vs mature students?\n- Do you find the three year length feels/is worth it as opposed to 2 year diplomas and 1 year graduate certificates at other colleges?\n- Is this program hard to get into? This does not really matter but I am just curious\n- Do you find you have enough space to choose and develop specific areas of technical expertise?\n- is there anything you wish you knew before going into this program?\n\nThank you for any info you can offer!!",

And from what it sounds like, each course is at least partially professionally focused?",

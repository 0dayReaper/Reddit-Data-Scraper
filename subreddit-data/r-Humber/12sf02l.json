    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nJust need clarification on three things. I know you can't between your study program is done and applying for PGWP.\n\nBut I'm a bit lost as to what receiving final transcript/ letter of confirmation means.\n\n1.So what is considered a final transcript? Ehat you need to request from the school that is signed by the registrars office? Or the transcript you can see online?\n\n2.Also, what matters more date of issue of the transcript/ letter or the date of graduation stated on the letter?\n\nSay my last official day was April 23\nBut the issued date of the email was May 1. Would I penalized for working between April 23 and May 1st?\n\n3. Is uploading the confirmation letter email/ and the unofficial (website) transcript good enough to apply for PGWP?",

    "postText": "So I have applied at Sheridan for SDNE and at Humber for computer programming and analysis. I wanted to know would SDNE be good for me without CO-OP, I went to Sheridan before for a similar program and failed my first semester so CO-OP is out the window. Or would Humber be a better fit? Heard it\u2019s pretty bad getting CO-OP there.",

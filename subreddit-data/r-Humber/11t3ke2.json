                            "comment": "All my courses are still online, but I do visit the campus on my days off to do some school work. There's a bunch of walking if you think you're getting away from that (you'd think you wouldn't have to walk so much to get from one end of campus to the other for a college). I do enjoy the buildings being connected to each other so you don't have to brave the elements. I attended York when the ttc buses were going into the loop, Humber has the buses entering the campus and it's a short walk to a set of doors into a building which I appreciate.\n\nThe vibe is a lot more relaxed among the students and I feel safer (I haven't been on campus late at night though, so can't comment on that). Because I don't attend in person lectures I can't comment on the lecture rooms, but the ones I've seen in the more recently renovated areas are nice. Learning commons isn't as depressing as Scott library, it has more sunlight lol. \n\nI think this is probably going to be common no matter what school you go to, administration is still bad at answering questions and getting you answers when you actually have an issue. I was unfortunate enough to have an issue at York and at Humber and I'm glad I kept my expectations low and had a lot of patience. I really hope this was unique to me, but because I attended Humber years ago (I dropped out after 1 semester), they just reactivated my old account and I didn't get a proper orientation on how to access the new student email, blackboard (equivalent to Moodle), or how to register for courses. I find the school assumes you know what you're doing or you're able to figure out what to do because you've been in a post secondary institution before, but fail to realize that not all post secondary institutions use the same programs. \n\nBecause class sizes are smaller you have more of an opportunity to interact with the professors (depending on the program and what year you're in this could be a different experience). Some professors are still just as scary as York's, but I find they do try and put in some effort to be warm and encouraging. Some of my profs at York were just kind of discouraging students all semester long. My current program is small, so I have the same profs from first semester going into second semester. \n\nI am in a program that has an internship component at the end. The profs have been  getting students ready to prep resumes and cover letters since half way through semester 1, and they have really been pushing us to apply for jobs and offer help, suggesting workshops/webinars, some one on one time to craft our resumes and covers letter and help with interview skills this semester. Having this type of motivation or push is something I never experienced at York. I found at York it was more of a \"here's your expensive piece of paper...bye!\" And we were left on our own to figure out what to do after if we didn't do that during our last couple of years, or were not smart enough to go into postgraduate programs. \n\nSorry this is kind of all over the place. I kind of just spit out what was on my mind and went with it. I hope it helped somewhat.",

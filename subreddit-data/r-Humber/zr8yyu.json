    "postText": "I was going through some personal stuff, in which resulted all my grades to drop the last 2 weeks of school. Which made me miss finals, long story short. I failed 4 classes and only passed 2. Would I be able to add the classes to the second semester, or would I just take the classes and leave some of the classes is semester two out and do it in semester 3. What are my options? How do I just talk to student services?",

She or he has been through this process a lot of times and it is their job to provide you with guidance. \n\nHumber is also very supportive of students that can benefit from academic accommodations so you should check in with them as well.",

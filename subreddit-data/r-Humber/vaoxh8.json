I applied on 17th May the day the course opened &amp; received my LOA for GBM course for the Jan\u201923 intake yesterday. I\u2019d suggest you should give it a week more to hear back from them, if not you can connect with the admission advisor, from what I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re very prompt and helpful with their replies. \n\nIf not, I\u2019d suggest to accept the offer from the other college and if you hear back from Humber, I\u2019m sure you can decline the older offer (maybe at a fee tho) @lisha_1998\n\nHope this helps, good luck xx",

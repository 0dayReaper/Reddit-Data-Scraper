Second year is when you learn all your nursing skills. Third and fourth year are lighter on class content and more clinical work and placements.",

Humber claims they are making alot of changes based on the suggestions from our year so hopefully it\u2019ll be better. It was mainly the whole transition difference from first year to second on top of having clinicals for the first time which is also kinda nerve wrecking. You can PM me if you have any direct questions , I\u2019d love to help !",

Some dropped out completely and some are behind like a year now.\n\nSemester 4 is content and assignment heavy. The Indigenous class alone had 8 assignments, so you have to stay on top of your readings and other assignments. Last minute studying will not suffice. Stats also has an assignment every week, plus small quizzes here and there.",

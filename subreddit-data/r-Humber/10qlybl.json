I\u2019ve studied at Humber North for 1.5 years in the business management prog and I have transferred to another college (hint: the one near square one mall) Im now doing business admin mktg (advanced diploma). I wanna come back to Humber and study business administration. Because the college I\u2019m at lacks in terms of college culture, quiet spaces and friendly atmosphere. But my gpa here is better than it was at Humber.",

(Add extra semesters etc.)\n\nWould switching back to Humber be a financial hit? If so, is the cost worth it? \n\nThen I would ask myself what I am looking to get out of the college experience. For most people (myself included) I mostly picked based on getting a good education and what school I thought provided the best program for that, with a mix of community feel. Other individuals may want a totally different experience that is more community oriented.\n\nHope some of these questions help you find your answer. Personally, I wouldn't switch back if you are doing better at your current college and considering you already left Humber once already. Both schools are very similar. The grass is always greener. Just my opinion though. Goodluck!",

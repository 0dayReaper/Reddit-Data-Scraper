    "postText": "Hey Guys, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently applied to the BIA program. I am currently a CPA and wanted to pivot more into Data analytics and coding. From the program description it seems really interesting however I was hoping for brutal honesty from current student about the following: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How is the work placement ? What is the avg salary range ? \n2. What type of employers usually recruit from Humber from this program ? \n3. Would you consider yourself competent to deal with any business related inquires in the future based on the skills you learned in the program ? \n4. What is the success rate of employment (domestic students) after you finish the program ? \n\nThank you in advance.",

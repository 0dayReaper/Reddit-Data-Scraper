    "postText": "I know this must be pretty common right now with the current global situation, but I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I thought I knew burnout but clearly that was wrong. Online school has destroyed my mental health. I could not care less about my grades, I have a bunch of exams this week and have barely studied for any of them. I don\u2019t even see a point in trying anymore. I used to be a 80-90% student who would spend hours working over assignments to make them perfect, but now I can barely get myself to read them one time before submitting. Even when I get a good grade I don\u2019t care, nothing feels enjoyable anymore, even my hobbies I used to love. Everything feels so meaningless. Has anyone found a way to work through this?",

This might be on the far end of the spectrum but I know someone who booked a cheap Airbnb for a day or two just to change the scenery around them once in a while. \nHope you\u2019re feeling better soon.",

I have come to realize that school is basically just a grind in the same way that some video games are, spending way too long on something that will hopefully be worth the effort.\n\nHopefully you are in a program that will help you get to your end goal.  If not, it is never too late to switch programs.  Also remember that you can (usually) take an extra year to deal with spreading out your workload.  Over the summer, take some time to reflect on the options you have.\n\nIf you or anyone else found this useful please don't hesitate to reach out to me.",

I hate feeling this way, I used to love school, and I know that this is the right program for me, but it\u2019s like my mind has checked out. I don\u2019t feel like myself or even a person anymore.

I am not sure how open  your faculty is to contact, but I suggest that you write what you did here \\^ and send it to your profs.  Sometimes the feeling of a breakdown (very vaild, by they way) is because of the unknown; not knowing what is happening for the exams, not knowing what is going on after your exams and doing all of this in a dark lonely space.  Also \\~ please get outside.  We live in an area that is in a strict lockdown too, and online is horrible for teachers (I teach elementary) so I downloaded audible and go for walks, get a coffee and listen to a book.  \n\nPlease take good care.  Know that this is temporary and we are so close.",

Thankfully I just finished my last exam so I have roughly 10 days before my next semester starts) and I\u2019m going to try to enjoy it as much as possible. Listening to audible on walks sounds like an interesting idea, I\u2019ll have to check that out. Thanks again :) we\u2019re all in this together, even while separated and apart",

    "postText": "So I had to pay my tuition out of my own pocket because I was having trouble with Osap.\n\nI finally got osaap and the entire amount was deposited into my bank account. However when I go into my Humber to see the fees, it says net cost is $1198.\n\nDo I have to pay this amount? Or am I OK since I was able to register for my courses and they haven\u2019t said anything.",

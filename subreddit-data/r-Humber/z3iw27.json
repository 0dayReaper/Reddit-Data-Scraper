The portal will automatically show after the successful transfer that you have a negative balance which means you\u2019ve covered 2 semesters fee. I hope this helps. Please feel free to DM me if you have any other queries :) Good luck!",

You can deduct the amount mentioned on your Offer Letter and pay the rest and don't worry about paying CAD 200-300 Extra because that would either be carried forward towards your next course or be refunded. I had to take this risk too because I will be filing for visa under SDS this week itself.",

    "postText": "Week one they were kind of working, just a few times I had to hold my phone really close to the reader for it to work.\n\nWeek two, it got worse. The few times I got it to work, I had to literally get out of my car and hold my phone right against the reader. Half the time it would just flash red and not work, and I'd have to get the attendant to open it for me. \n\nThe past two days it literally stopped working for me, both entering and exiting lot 13. The gate doesn't show up on my app when I'm near it and I had to press the emergency button to get in and out. This morning when I was pulling in, a guy trying to leave was having the same problem with his phone not being to open the gate, pretty sure the person behind me when I was leaving was stuck too.\n\nShit is starting to get really annoying.",

Older Android devices also don't use NFC with the Avro Mobile app. Both iPhones and older Android devices use Bluetooth to communicate with the reader.\n\nDo this next time:\n\n1. Turn Bluetooth on.\n2. Open the app and tap the icon on the top right that looks like a door. It's to the left of the Profile icon.\n3. Once the Readers List is open, all you have to do is get into range of one. Just wait a few seconds and tap the one you need. It'll be listed as \"X Lot - **IN** and X Lot - **OUT**\". See my screenshot here: https://i.imgur.com/p3optq3.png\n\nAlso, please spread the word. I spent some time just hanging out at the lot to educate others. A lot of iPhone users had issues with it because they were instructed to use it like a tap-to-pay machine.",

I was doing the same things in the steps you posted but I finally figured it out.\n\nIt seems like at the beginning of every week, it stopped working. I went into the settings and reset the Avro ID and the Lenel which seems to be a temporary fix at least. Still annoying as hell though.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! \n\nI'm a transfer student from a university possibly going to Humber, however I've received a couple offers to different nursing programs. I wanted to know the thoughts of current nursing students at Humber as I've heard mixed reviews about it.\n\nSome possible stuff you could mention:\n\n* How's the environment?\n* How difficult would you say courses are?\n* How are the profs?\n* Would you rather have gotten into a different school?\n* Do you get clinical placements? How are they and how soon would I be able to get placed?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated, thank you in advance! &lt;3",

            "comment": "Hey, I'm someone just about to finish my 3rd year in the Nursing program (UNB/Humber's Bachelor of Nursing degree), can try to give some quick answers to those questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Environment is relatively okay, especially if you stay inside most of the time. There are some places that I walked through in the times pre-COVID that had people smoking weed, but I don't know if that's a problem now.\n2. If you have a good way to study, memorize, and can critically apply your knowledge to a situation, you should be good. Some of the courses might be more abstract (i.e. Introduction to the Nursing Profession/BSCN 1011, or Nursing Theory/BSCN 2306, others may just have more content to deal with (Anatomy/Patho/Microbio, Chronic and Acute Care), and there's even one course where it might involve more memorization (Pharm); but if you have a good way to study (cards, concept maps, good notes and highlighting, etc.), and practice well with case studies, you should be good.\n3. The Bioscience (Anatomy, Patho, Microbio) and Psychology profs that I had were all nice, while the nursing profs may vary. Some may feel mean, some may feel too arbitrary, some may have inconsistent marking, but there **ARE** the nursing profs that are at nice and caring.\n4. Not really, to be honest. Plus, from the people that I know already in the field (at least within the GTA), Humber students tend to be good when it comes to new grads, at least that was the case when I made my decision to go to Humber in 2019.\n5. Yeah. I can't give specific details as placements can vary depending on organizations that allow Humber students to be there; but yeah, you get clinical placements. If I recall correctly, the current Humber program starts doing placements in 2nd year (anyone who started the BScN program in 2021 can clarify if they can if they've had clinicals yet or not though). How it usually works is that before the semester starts, you have to get all of your pre-placement stuff ready (click [here](https://healthsciences.humber.ca/current-students/work-integrated-learning/placements/getting-started.html) and click the normal \"Bachelor of Nursing\" in the drop down), and then a week or two before it starts you'll get access to the site where you can select placements. Generally, you rank them by preference, but you have to chose up to a specific number (if you have to rank 10, for example, you **HAVE** to rank 10 placements by preference, no more or no less). After you finish selecting your preferences and have them saved before the due date, you'll be assigned to a placement - it goes by your preference, followed by if there's already enough people assigned to that specific placement, and then it keeps in mind specific needs you may need (i.e. preferring carpooling with a friend in the program). Placements depend on which year and which organizations Humber could work with for that semester - but generally the progress through the program is Long-Term Care &gt; Maternity &gt; Mental Health &gt; Rehab &gt; Acute Care &gt; Complex Care &gt; Pre-Grad, with community health placements (mainly health promotion) sprinkled in between.\n\nOverall, I feel the Nursing program at Humber is actually pretty good, albeit sometimes being unorganized at times (COVID and transitioning from UNB/Humber collaboration to just Humber running the program probably affected things a bit). Even though I know that there are people with valid complaints out there, I do personally feel that a part of the mixed reviews of the program could come from two things - people who generally just complain a lot, and people having to deal with COVID basically making the past 2-3 years weird (with the program faculty struggling to deal with COVID just as much as the students).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps!",

            "comment": "Not in the BScn program but I do attend Humber for another degree program in the faculty of social and community services. The school environment is honestly great. I go to lakeshore since that\u2019s where my program is located but I sometimes to go to north campus to study since they have some good study rooms. One minor negative thing I found that before the pandemic the north campus was extremely packed and busy (Ofc this has changed now). Aside from this all of my profs have been really good. They teach well, they always help out, and at times provide feedback. ( and if you need accommodations they will provide, if you do need them I suggest you get in contact with the accessibility centre) One thing that may help you figure out if is a course is hard is checking out the [course outlines](https://humber.ca/transferoptions/course-outlines.html) on Humber  and then using course codes to look at rate my profs. Out of all my profs I had one professor that wasn\u2019t good but even though I checked rate my prof I tried not to judge but it ended up being true.(lol) . Aside from this faculty members like your student advisor and program coordinator actually do care, they also offer help and advice and answer any questions you have. Although I previously gotten other offers from some other Ontario universities I\u2019ve been happy with humber as my choice for a university/college. ( also you can check your [clinical placement](https://healthsciences.humber.ca/programs/bachelor-of-science-nursing.html) on the Humber website it should show which semester it will be offered in\u2014 it is in semester 6C.) I hope this helps you and good luck with your studies !!",

I also wanted to include that there is also a list of partners for clinical practices @ the [Humber website](https://healthsciences.humber.ca/current-students/work-integrated-learning/placements.html) ( not sure how Humber\u2019s nursing program compares to others with their nursing placements\u2014 but it seems like they have ton to choose from) also for your program I double checked and it seems like there is an [integrated practicum](https://humber.ca/print-friendly-version.html?code=NR411&amp;hideinfo=true&amp;delivery=1) you would have to do for a semester which is in the final year\u2014 term 8. There is additional info about these courses in the [link](https://humber.ca/assets/files/delivery-mode/bachelor-of-nursing.pdf) I attached. It is the program delivery mode for 2020\u2013 I want to note it is much more detailed compared to what is on the Humber site.  ( Lol I  honestly I don\u2019t write lengthy comments on here often so I do apologize if it is long.) &amp; Good luck !",

            "comment": "Hi there! Year 2 BScN student at Humber College here. \n\n1. The environment is very welcoming to all nursing students! I personally am a male nursing student and have never received any discrimination against that. \n2. The courses are no joke, they are very difficult and will keep you on your toes. Make sure you've got good ways of balancing work because you'll need it \n3. Most of the profs are great. All of the profs personally mark tests and assignments so feedback is always straight from the source and concise. Professors are usually quick to respond to questions via emails as well and are very understanding. I have had one negative experience with a specific clinical instructor, but no bachelors program is perfect\n4. Personally, I really wanted to go to McMaster's nursing program for that uni life. But after 2 years at Humber, I learned the advantages of Toronto nursing schools. As a nursing student, you are able to get jobs as \"clinical externs\" which are basically like paid clinical placements. I have seen many McMaster, Western and Queens students struggle to have access to these jobs since they lack not only the amount of clinical placements that we have, but also cannot network since they don't have as much variety in what hospitals they can actually get placed in.\n5. Yes we do get placements! Our placements start right at the beginning of Second year, and they're great. My very first placement was at Sunnybrook at the veterans care centre and although it was difficult, I enjoyed my placement there. I've also had placements in maternity and elementary schools which is pretty awesome!\n\nOverall, the Humber BScN program is really difficult, but it is very rewarding.",

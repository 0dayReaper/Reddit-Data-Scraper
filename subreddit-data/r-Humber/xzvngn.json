Like you final exam could be any day of time of the week no matter when the in person lecture usually takes place. Is this the same at Humber? Or is the final exam always on the last week of classes during lecture time?",

In some classes, it might be the second last or something else, with student presentations in the final week.\n\nYour prof should have provided you with this info -- check for a critical path on blackboard. If not, you should ask during your next class.",

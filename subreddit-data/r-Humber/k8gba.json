    "postText": "Yea so like the title says. Ask away. I definitely have some advice for you if you want to survive the program. Keep in mind that 10 000 people apply...something like 120 are chosen...and by 3rd year only 80 or so will remain. People drop out because of either problems that come up in life or they can't handle the insanity and pressure.\n\nEDIT: I'm at work right now.. on my break.  I have a production meeting at 8:30...but when I get home after today or by sunday the latest I'll dish out as much information and advice as I can.\n\n\n\nFirst Piece of Advice:\n\n\nYou are not in this program just to learn how to make film...making films in school and outside of school is about knowing how to collaborate with a lot of different people. \n\nThe way I saw first year was that it was a sort of trial by fire with a lesson attached. They ask you to make a film all alone + actors....no matter how good it turns out, you not only get to learn about all the different jobs and roles that go into making a film...by being forced to do them all alone..but you also learn that it's ridiculously hard, inefficient, impractical to make a movie all by yourself. It's a tough lesson that you've chosen a career that really requires a lot of different people in order to work well.\n\nThat's where second year comes in...second year they warm you up with a small documentary crew in first semester and a full on crew for an in studio drama...drama being the key word here. This is where you really learn what people are made off....long stressful hours in the basement studio under extreme pressure to stay on schedule. This where people lose it and drama erupts or you'll see those that can handle the stress and pressure, and those that even work better with that.\n\nBut you also learn that [at least in my experience] that even though the mood and general experience on the set can be extremely tense and stressful...where everyone is on edge and ready to blow up...doesn't necessarily mean that the movie will turn out bad as long as everyone does their jobs. This movie had an almost impossible amount of shots for the short time frame...and the director was unsure and unprepared...but it turned out to be the best and deepest film of that year.\n\nThird year is sort of like second year but more intense and on a bigger scale. More people...bigger budgets...bigger scripts. Everyone has learned who they work well with...and if you're one of those lucky people you'll have an awesome experience...but you'll also be pushed to your limit. You'll have a month of productions...you'll be on several different films spread throughout the month. \n\n\n\n2nd Advice \n\n\n\nYou are in competition with yourself and with everyone around you...you're also in competition to impress others with your ideas, your work ethic and your abilities and as well as how you are socially...friends in college that you learn to work really well with become your business partners they become your permanent crew and collaborators.\n\nIf you fail to prove to others that your are hard working and good and easy to work with...you'll be cut off from a large network of possible jobs.\n\nThe industry is very small...any advantage you can get when you get out of school is a great thing.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point....all the films you do in school are still not enough when you get into the industry [unless you win many awards]. Don't wait for co-op in 3rd year to start. Start volunteering on sets whenever you can...being a set PA is not always fun, but its the best way to learn about all the positions and how a set operate and it gives you a chance to get a taste of everything. Some people skip college and start of as PA's. If you can get a crew of people from school to shoot something over the summer...do it. Absolutely do it.\n\n3rd\n\nExperience every role and every job...you won't know what you're really good at, what you love, and what you truly hate to do or suck at unless you try it. While massive fuck ups that fuck over a whole group of people are to be avoided at all costs...you will make plenty of small mistakes and create problems...and fail...that's part of learning...but unless you try it all you won't know. If something scares you...go for it...\n\nBasically you're in school to make mistakes...mistakes won't cost you a job and paycheque, they won't destroy your reputation forever...as they would in the industry. They won't cost anyone massive amounts of money...mistakes you don't make in school...you'll make in the industry and the consequences will be much greater.\n\n\n@Women...ok so in my year women were a very small minority...most of them were brilliant, talented, and more hard working than most of the guys. Most of them cried at some point...why? Sometimes the pressure just got to them...other times...it was the guys...not all of them..but a minority of guys are massive assholes and other guys can also join in the assholery when they are part of a group of friends.\n\nLadies [if any of you are ladies] the film industry is male dominated...think of this as your own personal trial by fire...if you give up after some dick puts you down based on what's between your legs...then you probably won't survive in the industry, even though there are much higher consequences for them in the professional world. It's still male dominated...grow thick skin, you have to. Always stand up for yourself. \n\nOne of the first year cinematography teachers is a woman...not a lot of people liked her, but I did...she did some big films an got paid big money...but most of all, she's a badass. She started of as a grip so you can tell from her build that shes tough...but she's also tough-skinned...there is absolutely no way that she got to be a professional cinematographer on Hollywood shoots where she commands massive crews [of mostly men] without being tough and brilliant. I'm talking about Denise...like her or don't as a teacher, but she's definitely someone to look up to.\n\n\nWhat else...\n\noh yea for that dirty secret...3rd year films are really subjectively picked...yea there is first an in-class voting...yes the teachers may even elect some student advisers, there is even an overall voting for finalists. But really all of that only serves as a partial influence on what gets chosen. Stories about minorities [especially if the writer/director is a minority] will get chosen...even if they are cliche. If your story is about Jewish people or has Jewish people in it...or it's written by a Jewish person...it is far more likely to get picked even if it's bad.\n\nThe scriptwriting teacher is heavily Jewish and the program coordinator has a German Jew background. Also the industry itself is very Jewish influenced...so it's not like you're not getting a lesson about the real world. I have nothing against Jewish people, I have plenty of Jewish friends and the Jews in my class that wrote those story were all awesome and talented people. I'm just pointing out something most of us noticed regarding the picking of the scripts.\n\nBut in the end remember it's the coordinator and a couple of other teachers that pick the scripts. And the coordinator if it's the same one I had...doesn't have a great taste in movies, and hasn't made anything good either...once your script is chosen they will definitely try and push their ideas [which are sometimes good and most of the time bad and cliche], if you are a director or writer or producer...be very careful about what ideas you refuse and which ideas you accept.\n\nThat's the reality...face it. \n\n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom...you are going to meet a lot of great and like-minded people. You'll probably also smoke weed if you don't already...that's ok just don't let it or anything get in the way of learning...especially alcohol. Also socialize...parties at north campus in our program didn't happen often...but when they do..be there.\n\nIf you commute more than an hour an a half an you have a job outside of campus...you are in for a world of suffering. But if you make it through that you'll be a much stronger person.\n\nSorry about the multitude of spelling and grammar mistakes...I don't have the time to fix them right now.\n\nIf you do smoke weed on campus...don't make the freshman mistake of smoking at the gazeebo at the back....there is a camera directly pointed at that gazebo and security will come out. If you're lucky they will give you a warning before they call the cops...an this is fucking rexdale...there are always cops around.\n\nIf you're looking for a good spot...take the small hike to the top of the hill...that way you have an awesome view and if you're paranoid you can see people coming up the hill from far away. \n\nAlso the security cards are inept idiots...mostly. I witnessed an event where someone was haveing a seizure on the ground and the security guard was watching and having a conversation about what should be done with another security guard...in fact he called the other guy over..thankfully a badass radio program teacher yelled at him to stop being stupid and to call the ambulance.  \n\nAlso the bar on campus sucks balls...before and after it moved to its new location. Rexdale is sketchy and boring unfortunately...and the neighborhood of houses across the street is full of students and families that live there and hate parties...be prepare for parties to be shut down...even if it's oh like...end of the fucking year on a friday or saturday night.",

During co-op all the sets I worked on spoke highly of me, but either I didn't put the work into networking (likely) or I just didn't meet the right people. The sets I were on were great learning experiences but they didn't get me further along in my career after I finished co-op. \n\nI love being on set so I chose to intern on film sets...which are temporary. Others that made better choices, interned at companies and were better off for it as they had work after school.\n\nI've been on many sets since, and have met a lot of people. I've learned a great many things but none of that got me paying film work.\n\nFilm as a career is basically an uphill battle as I see it, and choosing to do what I absolutely love (cinematography) as even more of an uphill battle. I spoke to many old camera operators and cinematographers and met some young ones early on...and basically the lesson I came away with is that for cinematography there is no ladder to climb in Canada and that to be one you have to do cinematography.\n\nIn the US you can start of as a camera assistant or grip and climb your way to camera operator or gaffer then director or cinematographer. In Canada it doesn't work that way. You can do all these other jobs...but you risk being stuck in that role. If you make a great grip or gaffer, people are going to call you with work to be a grip or gaffer. They won't think \"Hmm..you know Vincent118 was such a great gaffer, I think he'd make a great DP for my shoot.\"\n\nThe lesson boiled down to \"If you want to be X, be X and do it as much as you can until everyone thinks of you for that role.\"\n\nAfter I finished school I went abroad for almost two months, and when I came back I was basically unemployed for a year [no luck in any field] and I worked on a bunch of indie productions to gain some real world experience.\n\nThen this summer I got to Co-Direct/DoP a music video, and I'm developing another one right now so I can DoP/Direct this one too, and both the artists are well connected in the indie scene in Toronto and Canada so hopefully if I can pull off some great work now I'll eventually have some serious cinematography credits under my name and then I can start thinking about joining the union and go on from there.\n\nTL;DR I haven't done as much with my life and film career as I could have and as some others did, but I haven't done nothing, I've learned much, met and networked with a lot of very talented people and am moving up.\n\nEdit2: I'm also working on creating a production company with a small group of people I've worked with for a while, so we can pool our resources better, and I'm also working on getting a 7D or 5D and kit, and I have a friend who's built a UAV so we can do aerial shots.",

If you can avoid it, don't buy light meters unless you're into cinematography. Hell I'm into cinematography and outside of the tests I was required to use it for I haven't touched the damn thing.\n\nThe one they get you to buy is very simply and analog. You really only need one once you get into long and complex shoots. But basically every year new kids spend $80-$160 on these light meters that the majority of them are never going to use.\n\nFirst year...that teacher...she didn't know how to setup a tripod...so out of frustration I went up and I showed everyone how to do it the proper way [ I learned in high school.] \n\nShe also teaches editing and the other editing teacher doesn't like her...cuz when she gets her students she has to re-teach them everything and it slows everyone else down.\n\nThey can't fire her until her contract runs out. Although I think they renewed it last year or something.\n\nBut as for the deteriorating numbers...honestly to make it in this business you have to have a fanatical single minded passion for it in order to make it...and your struggle in school may be more intense because of all the things you do in a short period of time....but in the industry you'll spend years fighting and surviving for every inch of success. If you can't handle 3 years of film school...you can't handle 10 years of struggling to make it.",

We shot Super 16mm on an Arri SR1...in first year...2nd year we had these shitty little SD cameras PDS or something...I forget...but I know they don't have those anymore. We got to shoot with the HD cameras which were Panasonic HVX-200 I believe, which weren't bad. We also got to shoot Arri SR-2 16mm for the in-studio drama.\n\n3rd year we could either shoot on the HVX, or the Arri SR-2...but a lot of people budgeted and fundraised enough that they could rent much better HD cameras [the fad at the time was to get 35mm adapters that gave you a film look...but some didn't turn out too well.]. I know one group rented a RED One at $500/day for the commercial shoots. Another group shot their film partially in 35mm and partially in 16mm. Which was pretty awesome because 16mm blown up to 35 doesn't look too bad. But yea third year we had free reign to get what we wanted with the budgets we worked with. But I also know the school is upgrading equipment all the time so that may have all changed.  \n\nI think I heard that they may have or are getting some RED cameras.",

Of course I'd love to work with it. I also get the feeling that maybe RED isn't doing much about those problems because they are trying to get their new cameras the Epic I think...and the Scarlett out. \n\nThere's just something about the modular design that appeals to me in regards to the new and unreleased cameras.\n\nBut right now only the 5dM2 and 7D are within reach of my budget...and according to some technical tests I've watched, those two DSLR's didn't do too bad against the RED's and Alexas and others when it came to things like color light range extremes and color fidelity and whatnot.  \n\nBut obviously I too would love to work with an Alexa.",

I certainly have/had a lot of complaints about the the school and some teachers, but I actually had a really good time there and learned a lot of valuable skills.\n\nThe program will definetly teach you a lot, but it's all about what you do there, slacking, procrastinating, partying. Burning relationships with your classmates (who can be prime contacts in your network once you finish) is a good way to waste 3 years and $10k+. If you start volunteering and co-oping on sets and in studio from year one, helping everyone you can on their project. Doing good work, and most of all working well with others. Egos, being a douche or asshole, putting others down, being unreliable is a quick way to cut yourself off from a network of peers that you'll need once you leave college.\n\nBasically \"College is what you make of it.\" and this works doubly so for film, where it's a lot more independent hands-on work rather than structured study.",

What I will say is that if you do take this program, be prepared to reach out way beyond regular classes to be educated. This is an industry based highly on technology and unfortunately because of that some of the education you will be receiving will be outdated. Research regularly and stay on top of current trends. What Humber doesn't offer in its classrooms it offers instead with available equipment to rent and editing suites(which, although not fantastic, are at least available), which is more than I can say for Ryerson who has to give-up their stuff to the Broadcasting program.",

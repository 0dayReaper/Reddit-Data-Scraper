    "postText": "Hello, I just finished my 3rd semester with 74 GPA and I\u2019m panicking because Humber accepts students who has 75% and higher GPA for bridging. Do y\u2019all think they will still consider me as a candidate? And how hard is the bridging program? :\u2019(",

            "comment": "Hi! As someone who was in a similar situation, I can say that try your best to make your overall gpa 75 'at least' by the end of the fourth semester. Obviously I cannot say Humber would accept 75 which is their minimum requirement but at least you are eligible for consideration. It will be best if you finish the pn with higher gpa but even if you don't and just 75 barely, don't panic too much cuz I've also seen someone who has 75 exactly from pn and got into another university's rn bridging program (actually has better reputation than Humber). Anyways, good luck:)",

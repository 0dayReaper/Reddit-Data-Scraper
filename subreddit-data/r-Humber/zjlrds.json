Or would it include the courses from the semester that you've already taken?\n\nI took some semester 3 courses before, and going into finals this week - the ones I repeated were pretty poor to say the least. So would they exclusively be calculating from the 5 courses I took this semester, or would they also factor in the ones I took before?",

At this point, you could either email VP of Humber College and express your concerns. I really hope it continues online but will wait for any updates from the college. \n\nAt the beginning of fall 2021, we were sent out a survey on how Winter 2022 should be carried out and the majority of students voted for in-person learning. I voted for hybrid.",

So I\u2019d advise everyone to get it before Humber rushes them to do it!\n\nThat said, if hospitalization stats in Ontario turn ugly in the next few weeks, I can\u2019t imagine a full return to the classroom for the first half of Winter 2022.\n\nEdit: I forgot that some programs were in-person or hybrid for Fall 2021, so I added \u201cfull\u201d to my last sentence.",

Or anyone who is currently enrolled in the program and willing to share their experiences so far within the program. Any advice from those currently enrolled in the program would be greatly appreciated as well:)",

As you will be doing placement during second semester, you\u2019ll be introduced to the requirements on getting your placement clearance done in first semester. I recommend you start completing it the moment ur introduced to it by ur ECE120 professor to avoid unexpected issues. But congrats and wish u best of luck!",

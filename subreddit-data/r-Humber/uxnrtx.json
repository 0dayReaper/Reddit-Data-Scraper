            "comment": "Lakeshore is beautiful! There are a bunch of old buildings from when it was a psychiatric hospital a hundred years ago, and it\u2019s beside a decently sized park along the shore of Lake Ontario. I took a city bike along its paths a few times. \n\nAs for the social life, it could be better. It\u2019s a commuter campus, so people from Toronto and the rest of the GTA tend to leave campus ASAP after class because commute times are horrible. Restrictions on res visitors have loosened, so residents can hang out with guests in the lounge on their floor. \n\nFood is hit and miss. The caf food is overpriced, not all of the cafs were open last term, and the Tim\u2019s on campus is understaffed. But there\u2019s now a Starbucks in the white campus building on the SW corner of Kipling and Lakeshore! Seriously though, you\u2019re better to go to the restaurants on Lake Shore - across the street from campus, as well as east and west of campus.",

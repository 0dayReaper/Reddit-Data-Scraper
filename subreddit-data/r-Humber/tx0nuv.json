            "comment": "I also applied to Humber\u2019s BScN program. I am in pre-health so won\u2019t hear back until my final grades are submitted. Honestly, it\u2019s hard to find any good feedback about many of the nursing programs on Reddit, most people come here to complain. For me I chose Humber because of its location and reputation. George Brown didn\u2019t have great reviews from my research as students said it was extremely disorganized and they were underwhelmed by their placements. The other colleges were too far away, and my prior university marks were not competitive enough for university programs. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve been very happy with my experience in the pre-health program at Humber. I like all my instructors and I feel supported in my program. North Campus is also nice and new. So I hope my experience this year is a good indication of what my experience will be like in the Nursing program next year.",

            "comment": "Congratulations! \n\nTo be fair, you would probably hear bad things for just about every nursing program across the country because nursing education is **hard.** what you want to see is how well a school prepares. its graduates for the NCLEX at the end. Humber consistently has had 85%+ of its students pass the NCLEX on their first try. Compared to my other choice, Ontario Tech (77%), this tells me that their students are better prepared. \n\nNursing education also builds on itself so you may learn things in first year that feel pointless and arbitrary in the beginning but really come into play in upper-year courses. This can get frustrating if your prof isn\u2019t a great communicator and you feel like they\u2019re just being needlessly picky.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have some good profs, okay profs and some that make you wonder why they even got into teaching. This isn\u2019t nursing specific or Humber specific.\n\nI\u2019ll be starting the BScN 4-year program in Fall 2022 at Humber. DM me if you want.",

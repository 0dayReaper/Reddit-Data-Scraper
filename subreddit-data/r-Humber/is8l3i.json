    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m one of the founders of Toronto Student Cinemates (TSC), a club that organizes weekly Netflix Party sessions for Toronto students.\n\nTSC provides an opportunity for students to take a much needed break and connect with others (because let\u2019s be honest, watching movies is more fun with other people).\n\nOur first screening will be this Thursday at 7:00 PM (EST) and we\u2019ll be watching *Catch Me if You Can* (2002). We\u2019ll also have Viewer\u2019s Choice nights and our Discord server has a dedicated channel for people who want to organize their own Parties.\n\nWhether you want to join in on the conversation or just focus on the movie, we hope you\u2019ll tune in this Thursday! If you\u2019re interested, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/qj3QmRp). You can also follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/torontostudentcinemates/) for more updates!",

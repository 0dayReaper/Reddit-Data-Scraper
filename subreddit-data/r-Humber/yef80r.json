    "postText": "Hi! I'm an international student and not too sure about how health insurance works here in Canada. I'm looking to book an appointment with a psychiatrist for a diagnosis and maybe be put on meds. Although I have no clue how much of the psychiatry services + prescription drugs are covered under the insurance. I did go through the Morcare website that Humber links to but honestly, it's not very clear. If anyone could help me out, I'd be grateful. Thanks!",

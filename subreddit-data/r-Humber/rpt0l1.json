    "postText": "I finished my master's degree in math 6 years ago. I've done some translations and data entry jobs during the past few years which are, well, useless! Due to the mentioned and other circumstances I am planning to take my chances in Canada (I've got family there). I have no programming experience, except for several MATLAB projects I did during my master's years, if that even counts. Is a two year computer programming diploma at Humber worth it for me? Is it almost enough for finding a programming PG work after graduation?\n\nThank you!",

But in reality the majority of universities prefer CS graduates for such program. There aren't many good math careers out there either, except for teaching which is a bit of a tricky choice when you're pursuing it in another country. Even if I get accepted for CS, I don't know what my future job would be like since I have no related work experience.",

If you are a PR then you have better options such as bootcamps.\n\nThe humber program is not that great by itself but you could use the time to become a decent programmer or maybe data scientist which is another good career here, your math masters might give an advantage there.",

    "postText": "Hi, writing this for my girlfriend, she just moved into North campus residence and is in her first year and moved in during move in week. I\u2019m supposed to be visiting her ( long distance because of school now) and luckily her going to school and my parents plans happen to coincide that I\u2019ll be able to see her one last time before the summer ends. I was supposed to stay the night in her dorm room, but guests aren\u2019t allowed for the first 3 weeks!? :( \n\nWe\u2019re trying to figure out if there\u2019s some way she can still get me in considering I really really don\u2019t wanna cancel our plans of seeing each other one last time before we both have to start school.\n\nAnyone have any advice/possible ways we could make it work? The help would be much appreciated.",

They do have all the doors locked and a desk person 24/7 so it's not easy to sneak someone in but if u try with the card u probably have a better chance now since there will be a lot of new faces so at least they won't think it's sus they don't recognize u",

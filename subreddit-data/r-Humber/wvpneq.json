            "comment": "This city/region is in a housing crisis, so prices unfortunately suck all over. The competition for housing gets worse for September because students from all over enter the market on top of everyone else in the city. Out of all the months, September is probably the worst for new renters.\n\nWhen I was a Humber student I did a combination of Airbnb for a few months and then Kijiji for the remainder. Once you arrive in Toronto and can tour homes yourself, landlords tend to perceive you are more legit/serious and are more receptive. \n\nMy advice is to focus on getting yourself safe shelter for September, especially if you aren\u2019t within a day trip of Humber. Once you got that settled, focus on the rest of the school year. The GTA\u2019s housing market will still be Hell in October, but it will be relatively better than right now.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I used Kijiji sublet/roommate listings.\n\nEdit #2: This post is quite comprehensive https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRenting/comments/vrzh17/rental_tip_what_websites_should_i_look_for_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

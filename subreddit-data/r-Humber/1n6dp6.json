If you see mentions of Humber College in other subreddits or websites then link to this subreddit. And finally people can try posting reddit aliens with /r/humber around the school.\n\nAnd if anyone has any suggestions that I can do as a Mod then just let me know. ;)",

I would be down with talking to the HSF on Lakeshore and maybe post our snoo on those bulletin boards all across campus.\n\nCollege and university subreddits have a lot of potential to become thriving communities. Just go check /r/UofT or /r/Mcgill. And I think that comes a lot from IRL involvement of students with the reddit community.\n\nIt is a long way before we reach that. We even need to come up with guidelines for the subreddit. but I'm sure that with enough work and commitment we could turn this into a great and maybe \"official\" community :)",

Posting the reddit alien and our url would be a very big help and our subscriber base would increase quickly.\n\nWhy do you suggest we need guidelines? It seems like everyone here is civil and I'm quite fine with the community itself downvoting people it feels should be downvoted. It's democratic. I prefer to just remove spam.",

And the guidelines must encourage good and engaging content, you know what I mean? Any large subreddit has guidelines that clearly define the kind of content that can and can't be submitted.\n\nFor example, just from the top of my head, we could really use simple guidelines like:\n\n-If your post is only relevant to students from a specific campus please tag your post as [NORTH] [LAKESHORE] or [ORANGEVILLE]\n\nand simple stuff like that, I think you get the idea.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, bringing more people here won't automatically mean there will be better content. We also need a platform made for better content ",

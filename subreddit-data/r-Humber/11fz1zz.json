    "postText": "Hi,\n\nUnfortunately, my study permit got rejected. I was enrolled in a 2 year design diploma course called Interactive Media Design.\n\nI am 30 years old and have a bachelors degree in Business Administration with a specilization in Accounting. My work experience is mainly accounting based.\n\nI have advised that as per my profile that I should go for a post graduate diploma or masters that is related to my academic and work background. Masters is out of my budget so I am going for a post graduate diploma.\n\nBut, the problem is most postgraduate diplomas are of 1 year.\n\nIs it possible to enroll for another postgraduate diploma after completing the first one?\n\nAlso, can you please recommend pg diplomas I should go for based on my profile.\n\nThank you",

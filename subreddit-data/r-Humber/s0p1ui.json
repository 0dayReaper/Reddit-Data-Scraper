    "postText": "Does anyone commute to Humber College Lakeshore campus from the greater Toronto area, mainly the Whitby / Oshawa area? \n\nIf so can you describe the experience, and how much does it cost? \n\nIs it less expensive to take a train, or to drive and pay for parking?\n\nIs it feasible to expect to be able to participate in school teams and clubs, or is it too far of a distance to have a rich student life while maintaining a job and at least a B average?\n\nI know that taking the Go Train takes about 90 min, I figure that could be used as study time; but my main concern is the cost of taking the Go Train at least 3 times a week.",

            "comment": "Driving from Whitby/Oshawa to Lakeshore would be a nightmare and probably more costly than taking the Go Train. The convenience of Long Branch station being just up the street from campus will be more valuable to you in my opinion. There may even be discounts for students for Go Train passes that could save you some money.\n\nAs for extra-curricular it really depends on how you schedule your time, and is really dependent on your work schedule and the like, you could always speak to any of the guidance counsellors they have in student support to get ideas on how to manage your time to participate.\n\nI would also look into whether or not they still leave the Commons building open to students 24/7, its not unheard of for students to spend a night in one of the study rooms so you may save yourself a trip if you have classes on back-to-back days.\n\nCheers",

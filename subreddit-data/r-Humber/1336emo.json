    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI'm thinking about getting admission in the program and need some feedback on how the program is. Are there any coop positions or any other hands-on opportunity? How popular is this program? Are the lectures online or in-person? For those who graduated from this program, how was your experience in finding the job? Do they have projects in the program? Any other feedback?",

    "postText": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m an international student who applied for a post grad certificate course. Since I completed my undergraduate degree fully in English, I thought I would be exempted from providing an English proficiency test results but the admissions office says other wise. They have requested me to submit the test results within 21 days but my IELTS score wouldn\u2019t be able to make it within the mentioned date. I\u2019m considering to quickly get a duolingo test result as well since they give results within 1-2days. But does the admission accept duolingo?",

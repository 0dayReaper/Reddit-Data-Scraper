    "postText": "Hi.....\n\nMy name is Teni. I am 22 years old. I go to Humber College North, and I am currently looking for a place to live. I want to live close to school. I cook, and I am not a vegetarian (because you have to be one to find a place these days). As I was saying, I cook with spices and such (I saw an ad for a house that said no cooking or heavy spices). I do not want to live with Indians (no offense, and if you are offended, well, you can't please everyone). I would like the lease agreement to be for a year but am willing to do 8 months. I am clean, organized, friendly, and not noisy. I am okay with anyone as long as you are also friendly, clean, and organized. It's okay if you are noisy. My budget is $900 max (including hydro and wifi). I hope my future landlord or roommate responds to me soon.",

The good thing though is that you can post asking for a place to live and people will share options or contact you if they are looking for a roommate. Give it a try! You could also try the dorms at Humber, I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll adjust to your budget or if there is any available right now",

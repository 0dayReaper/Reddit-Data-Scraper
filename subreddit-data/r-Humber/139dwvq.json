    "postText": "Hey guys, I\u2019m starting a program at Humber (the Lakeshore campus) this summer and I\u2019m looking for a little bit of insight on the parking situation at Humber during the Summer months. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s typically hard to find parking on campus during the regular school year (Sept-April), and I was wondering if this is the case in the Summer as well? I\u2019m planning on getting to campus early the first couple of commutes, but any insight/parking advice you guys have would be awesome!",

I\u2019m not sure how busy it is during the summer. But I noticed during the fall &amp; winter terms that it is most busy during the day, and then around 3/4 it\u2019s easier to find spots",

And to park at the residence lot you need to purchase a parking pass.  \nIf you don\u2019t want to pay and don\u2019t mind walking a bit I\u2019d suggest finding a spot to park on 13th st or twelfth st.",

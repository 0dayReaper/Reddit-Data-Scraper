We're looking for participants who are 18-30 that are in post secondary education. If you volunteer to take part in this study, your participation will consist of taking part in a 30 minute interview on Zoom. Information collected will only be used for this class project, and all responses will be anonymized. If this sounds like something you would be interested in, please fill out this survey: [https://forms.office.com/r/FRtf4E9QVb](https://forms.office.com/r/FRtf4E9QVb)\n\nFor more information about this study, please contact us on this account or email us at shivdasa@sheridancollege.ca",

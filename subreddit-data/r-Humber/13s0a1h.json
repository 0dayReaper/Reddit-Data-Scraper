The student Capstone projects showcased this year showed a lot of skills and creativity and industry sponsors and coaches were excellent. The first year is heavy in maths, it's engineering. There will be mandatory coop terms to complete in higher years. Prospects look good but there's so many layoffs in the industry you'll have to interpret how that relates to your interests. Coders and automation specialists are in demand though.",

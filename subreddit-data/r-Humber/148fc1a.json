    "postText": "I compared between some options I found on the internet and shortlisted Tartu, Parkside and Campus Co-op residence.\n\nWhat do you know/think about these options?\n\nI got letter of Acceptance from Humber College for September 2023 intake and have to make a decision fast as rooms are getting filled so quickly (would go with Neill Wycik but no vacancy for fall)\n\n-Parkside seems money-hungry, I would go with it still but the raging reviews are food for thought. My main concern is food. Does anyone know anything about their food quality and options recently? What about Halal food options? Any good for the whooping 3-4k meal plan they\u2019re yanking out of your buttpocket?\n\n-Tartu also has horrendous reviews, although cheaper and no mandatory meal plan, idk how it compares with Parkside in terms of community/social aspect (probably not as good as Parkside). Also room size is even worse than Parkside I think. Anyone staying over there can whisper to me a word or two?\n\n- Campus co-op would probably be my last resort, price wise good but I\u2019d still prefer the social and community aspect of something like Parkside (events, campus feel, great places to study and chill etc are not gonna be available in campus coop houses I think)\n\nAny other options you think I should look into? Budget is max 1500. Huge emphasis on social aspect as an international student I do not plan to be depressed and lonely. Also better if its in core Toronto close to Humber Intergalactic Graduate School campus (its a dead campus hence the emphasis on community living).\n\nThank you sm if you made it this far, your experience is valid and worthy of a comment below so shoot!!",

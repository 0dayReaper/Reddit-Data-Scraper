They give a lot of anti-Humber advice here based on their negative experience with very little to back it up.   \n\n\nA lot of people have excellent experiences with Humber and a lot of people have bad experiences with Humber. It's the same with absolutely every post-secondary institution. I would personally recommend you try and get in contact with someone from each of the programs and see if you can get some more information directly from someone in that program.  \n\n\nTo my knowledge there is a discord server for Seneca and I run the one for Humber (pinned post on this subreddit) and that may make it easier to get a student to get back to you.  \n\n\nHope this helps!",

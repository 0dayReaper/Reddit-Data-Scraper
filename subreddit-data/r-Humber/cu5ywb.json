Kelly, Melanie, Sheva, Wolfgang, and Nancy are some of the professors who I have had classes with and they're awesome. Brenda, who is the program director is also an amazing person to talk to if you have any problems. The way they go about placements too is very straightforward. You become very close with your cohort because the program is fairly small, so definitely network with them because I can almost guarantee you will see them once you begin your career too. The field of CYC is small so the more you can put yourself out there the better.",

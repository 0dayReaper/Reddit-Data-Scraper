In the website you can find the transfer advisor of Humber college and connect with [them.](https://www.ontransfer.ca/index_en.php?page=start_transfer&amp;sec_id=4). \nAnd again you can look at the Humber pathway search tool on Humber if the first link I provided is to confusing. After getting the credits you need to transfer you apply to the other school for admission and a transfer assessment. If you decide to leave in your first year the transfer will be course to course meaning the courses will be assessed individually. However, you are doing a program transfer it will be assessed altogether( ex. From diploma-&gt; degree)",

I think you might have to contact them to  [register](https://www.ontransfer.ca/index_en.php?page=contact_us) they might set it up for you.  \n\n once you have transferred over you would be getting your credits at the other school not humber.\n\nAnd as long as the courses you have obtained in your first year are bit similar to the university you want to transfer to you should be fine.  You should get in contact with the transfer advisors of the other schools to see if your courses and credit would be approved before you do your year at humber. Thats if you want to be on track and also don\u2019t want the time you spend at Humber to be wasted.\n\n(Ontransfer is just a website that provides transfer guidance)",

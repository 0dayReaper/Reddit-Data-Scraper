If you've recently graduated from GH/Humber in the past 5 years, please tell us about your\nexperience finding a job. I'm in bba business admin so that's what I'm interested in hearing about but I'm sure other people will see this thread and want know about job perspectives for their programs. If possible mention (gpa, salary and if you've had co-op or any other experience). Feel free to dm me as well.",

            "comment": "I graduated in June 2021 from the Game Programming program and was head-hunted by one of my professors upon graduation to work at his company. That professor was also a previous student of the program who was offered a job to teach a class in the program.   \n\n\nIt's obviously a case by case thing, but it's entirely possible to get a job after graduation. The piece of paper is one thing, but normally employers care a lot more about you demonstrating that you can do the job that you're setting out to do and the paper is just supposed to be assurance of that fact.  \n\n\nI don't know exactly what jobs a BBA business admin student would be looking at but as long as you can competently and confidently complete the work you set out to do, finding a job shouldn't pose too much of a struggle (provided your field job market isn't entirely over-saturated)",

Since you are in the tech side of things they care about your skills and projects. As for business I\u2019m not quite sure. Plus your gaming program is very difficult, most people would probably just do something easier like software development. I was once told by a student that his teacher said some of the things they learned in game development, the teacher learned only a few years  ago.",

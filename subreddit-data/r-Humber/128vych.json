If anyone could give me some insight into the courses and placements and whatnot for the 2 years after that first prep semester I'd really appreciate it. I swear all the info Humber puts out is just for that first prep semester.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m not in the program, but you have to pass every courses in the preperatory semester with at least a 75% before you get into the real semester. If and when you pass, you\u2019ll start the 5th sem (start of 3rd year of the nursing program) on January. You\u2019ll basically be doing the same thing as every direct entry nursing but when you pass the prep semester, you\u2019ll be joing the 3rd year students. In second entry, you\u2019ll only do the last 2 years of the 4-year bscn + the placements. Look at the courses of bscn direct entry nursing program and go to the 5th - 8th semester \u2014 that\u2019s the courses you\u2019ll be doing after. You can also search up \u201chumber college course outlines then type the course codes so you\u2019ll know what the topics will be and how many quizzes (and the weight as well)",

On our academic progress page we have a list of the course requirements for the next 2 years, but some don't have outlines completed and our placements past this year are not yet determined . Right now the placement in Rehab, summer semester is community, and fall is mental health. The program is VERY self directed. Let me know if you have any other questions :)",

Every week has a lot of readings and those readings are not covered in lecture (but are testible material). Thus a lot hinges on you keeping on top of said readings and working with your own learning style to study the material. Also during the prep semester 1 class was entirely online without lectures, completely self directed. Also one class we have this semester (Nursing comcepts) had about 40% of all the weeks lectures as asynchronous as well.",

As long as you do the work and show that you are trying they will answer any questions you have and take the time to go over your marks with you. I can't say fortune you will have the same profs as me though because there are a lot of changes going on right now. One of my favorites was Dr.Dipa. I had her for both Patho 1 and 2 and she is amazing at condensing the information into an understandable format and assisting with disease differentiation. \n\nAll the people I know who failed out did so because the requirement percent to pass the prep semester was so high (70%). If you get below a 70 in any class you are immediately removed from the program.",

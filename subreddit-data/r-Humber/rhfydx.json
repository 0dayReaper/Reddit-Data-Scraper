    "postText": "Sorry for the rant but I\u2019m so done with Humber\u2019s bullshit. \n\nI started the Business Administration program at the north campus in Sept 2020, as everything was online and I always had trouble attending classes. Knowing that online learning may have been temporary, I powered through my coursework with 7 courses each semester including the summer, just so I can finally finish post-secondary. I have been able to finish 5 semesters since enrolling and have 6 course left to complete. \n\nFast forward to registration for Winter 2022 semester and the update email they had sent us (Nov 12/21) let us know that they are increasing the amount of online learning available and to reach out to your PC if there are any issues. I had to move away from Ontario due to unforeseen circumstances this summer but figured I could finish my final semester. Come registration, I see that only 3 of my 6 courses needed were offered online. I reached out to my PC to ask for options as I only have the single semester left to complete and attending in-person is not an option. The options they gave me included:\n\n1) Take a deferral and come back at a later semester to complete my courses.\n\n2) Enroll at another school which offers those classes online, and transfer the credits over when complete. \n\nI understand that me moving is out of their control, but the lack of ability to make accommodations or offer any type of support for students is appalling. I can\u2019t imagine if I was an international student during COVID, paying as much as they do, and was told that if I was unable to come to in-person classes I could not finish with them. For someone who is attempting to finish school for the third time and finally got my shit together (dean\u2019s list in all 5 semesters after failing out multiple times) this was such a slap in the face and I will be transferring every completed credit to another school to finish. \n\nMy apologies for the rant and I may be the asshole here but FUCK HUMBER.\n\nEdit: As an update, I have now learned that the courses I need which are not offered online have literally 0 other equivalent courses at any other school that I could transfer to complete my program. My options are now to defer until forever or lose half of my credits when I transfer out. Thank you for all of your help and support Humber!!",

Ideally I would love to not have to commute 2 hours a day but I knew that it would be a possibility even though my program was 100% online when I applied. Do you think that it would be worth the hassle of moving back for one semester if that meant you could finish your program and move on? Im sorry this is happening to you, lots of people are in your boat, but that\u2019s just how it is. Having three out of six course online is pretty good, I was only able to get one out of six for winter.",

There was no in-person option when I enrolled, regardless of if it is \u201ctypically\u201d in-person or not. If they claim to be focused on offering a flexible learning environment, it\u2019s a bit ridiculous that they discontinue the flexible learning environment partway through with no options. To touch on the options I was given, I was told that you can defer up to 2 semesters then you give up your place in the program. It is unlikely I can come back, therefore not an option. Secondly, if I transfer to a local school I lose about half of my credits. As I\u2019m sure you can understand, finding somewhere that offers 3 sixth semester courses online that are even eligible to transfer and equivalent to the courses I need is not simple. This is not to mention that I\u2019ve been waiting 4 weeks now (emailed guidance on Nov 18th to figure out if there are any courses available) for any follow up on courses that I could possibly take to transfer. Please don\u2019t act like Humber is there for it\u2019s students, it\u2019s fuck Humber and that will never change.",

Half your classes are available online. That is flexibility, it\u2019s not just for you because you moved out of the province which is weird to do since you are registered in a program that is not fully delivered online. \n\nYes you could have moved for good reasons but you still moved. When people move they transfer schools or have a plan to transfer schools.",

Obviously the school would want to have in person classes. I am not arguing if they should or not. My issue is that we were never told that online would not be an option moving forward. I enrolled in a program that was offered online, with no in-person option. Whether it is historically an in-person course or not, we were not warned that online courses would not be offered. The fact that there is no option to finish my program online, even though that is how it started and how I was originally accepted is the source of my gripe, not the details of the situation. Arguing with you feels like how it is to talk to Humber, you don\u2019t actually listen to what I\u2019m saying you are just stating your beliefs lmao",

What they\u2019re doing could just lead to an outbreak at the college and having to go online anyways, so why not but safe and do it. Them pushing for in-person while cases rise does not make them appear as if they care about students, rather it makes them look like they don\u2019t value the safety and health of their staff or students.",

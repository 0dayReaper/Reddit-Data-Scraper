    "postText": "I just enrolled at Humber (going to start in September) and for some reason I can no longer access my Humber. The login button on the page that leads you to my Humber just returns an error. I don\u2019t have anything due right now (I already paid off my tuition deposit) but I\u2019m starting to get a little anxious. I can log in to blackboard just fine but certain services are preventing me from logging in. Is anyone else having this problem??",

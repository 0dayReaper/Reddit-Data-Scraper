            "comment": "Don't go to Humber for the 2nd entry nursing. This school is so unsupportive. They are only after your money. The program is crap. They admit a ton of students and then try to kick people out by making the prerequisite courses unnecessary difficult. There was no reading week for the final exams. We had lectures up to the last Friday and had exams on Sunday. All the exams were squeezed into one week. Imagine having 6 exams within 1 week ! Some of the professors also enjoy deducting your marks. However, there were a few good professors too. \nThey overload you with coursework and assignments. You will hate it. They also make it very difficult to transfer credits into the nursing program. Humber College 2nd entry nursing program is a crap program.  There are better nursing programs out there.Don't say you were not warned.",

I recently got accepted into this program, I applied because it was the only program where you can do the science perquisites after you get in, but now you have me worried. I am wondering if you could share the materials with me so that I can have a look. Please let me know.",

Most other accelerated nursing programs require you to have these courses before applying and they are very costly to do online.",

They first put students in the preparatory semester which u need to pass with 80%GPA and then u will be transferred to the nursing degree that starts in Jan 2023 for 6 semesters with no summer off.  Just wondering do you have both the degree and the high school credits?",

Yes I graduated with a life science bachelors, and I\u2019m missing only 2 out of the 6 courses, does that mean I have to do those 2 courses for a whole semester, or can I fast track and take some of the nursing classes during that semester as well? Also, I have to get 80% in all of those courses? So if the courses I already took were less than 80 I suppose I need to retake them.",

I took it way back in 2013 or 2014 so my info is outta date perhaps\u2026.\n\nDon\u2019t memorize\u2026 understand what you\u2019re learning and how to use it practically. \n\nWhen I was in it, you had to pass 100% on ALL quizzes. Practice your dosage calculations, and go to all classes. \n\nThis course as all nursing courses build upon each other\u2026 also understand that practicing nurses look drugs up so don\u2019t beat yourself up too hard \n\nGood luck!",

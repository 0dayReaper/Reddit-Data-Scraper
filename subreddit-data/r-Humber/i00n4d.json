    "postText": "I'm pretty upset about this, to be quite honest. I'm a student with accommodation to take a reduced course load and I am unable to register because I don't yet meet all of the requirements for the 5th semester courses, but I also can't view the 3rd semester blocks. I sent an email to the program coordinator to get this sorted out, but it is pretty annoying that I can't register at all. I imagine this will also be an issue for anybody who has a job because the courses in this program have always been all over the place, even when they were meant to be taken together.",

I hope this gets sorted out :/ They didn't even need to make it block based though, the only difference between the 2 blocks is a single class. Utterly ridiculous if you ask me",

Told this semester would be online so didn't get a place in town then told I'd have to take buses all the way to either Cambridge or kitchener just to take the train to Toronto twice a week because 2 of my classes were offered both online and offline and the online section naturally filled up instantly... thankfully the school was able to move me into the full section after I explained how stupid this shit is lol\n\n\nThe school is mishandling this school year hard and it hasn't even started",

Also the one in person class I have they cut into thirds so it went from nearly 3 hours to roughly an hour long due to how many students they are allowed to have in one room. So this class is split between four groups of us (one group at a time) and its super condensed and rushed - its fucking awful.  \n\n\nThis was not something I was informed about until the day before class - like the fucking time table still has the original time/length. I would NOT have taken this course if I knew this shit.",

I've been planning on applying for residence for my 1st, because being 19, girl and international student I feel like it's safer(?\nAnyways, I want to know the opinion of someone else because applying for residence is kinda risky,\n\nso should I apply and look for something also off campus?? is it cheaper?? or should I go with the off campus option complety? Idk I'm just kinda anxious so any so any opinions are well received:)",

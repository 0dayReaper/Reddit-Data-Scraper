            "comment": "Hey! The IPAC graduate certificate is a new program at Humber and is launching officially in September of this year. So there wouldn\u2019t be anyone with previous knowledge of the program. That being said I have looked into the certificate myself because I am partially interested in it. It is mostly geared for people who want to pursue careers in infection control and eventually getting their CIC. I\u2019m not sure it would be helpful for an MPH. I think it depends on what you are trying to pursue with your MPH. \n\nAre you interested in a career in IPAC? Or are you perhaps trying to boost your GPA for the MPH admission? Are you thinking about going to med school? \n\nI think it would be a good idea to reach out to Humber or some coordinators for the program and see if they can help!",

Yes I am particularly looking into boosting my GPA for admission in to a Public Health Masters Program as well upgrading my knowledge and skill set. Since it offers courses in epidemiology and clinical infections I thought it could potentially help with serving as good baseline certification.",

I think it would be beneficial to find out from the schools you would like to apply to if they will consider marks from a graduate certificate. Then I think doing the program will be helpful because of the courses you mentioned and the practicum component program offers. The extra experience should help to make your application more attractive. \n\nGoodluck! I hope everything works out for you!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

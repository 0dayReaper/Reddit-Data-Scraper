    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m attending Humber this fall for Digital Communications and I went to register for classes today, loaded my plan, and NONE of the classes I need are showing up. Was I too late? \n\nI registered for other classes that I\u2019m supposed to be taking in my 4th semester as a back up because I don\u2019t want to be stuck with no classes at all. \nHow do I fix this??  I\u2019ve called but they never answer and I\u2019ve sent an email but it will take a while for me to get a reply. \nDid I ruin my first year by being one day late to register?",

Go to student, academic progress and then make a list of the courses in your first semester (should be in blue font to the right) these are the ones you need to register for.\n\nIf this is no help contact the college",

Did you make sure the plan didn't have time conflicts and you had the right amount of classes for the semester? \n\nUltimately your classes may need some moving around. Hopefully, they shoot you an email back soon. If not, email me, I'm not the best at this stuff but I studied the website for the past couple of weeks. maybe I can help?  \n\n\nJaclyn.hughes.a@gmail.com",

    "postText": "Hello everyone\n\nI applied to Seneca, Lambton, Humber and Centennial to different graduate programs Mid-December. I got rejected this week from Lambton (High competition) and Seneca (No seats for Int. students). \n\nI applied to Global business management at Humber which is pretty a competitive program due to an obvious reason ;) I have a Bsc. in Management Information Systems with a GPA of 3.1/4 and IELTS 7. I was pretty sure about the strength of my profile but now i doubt everything lol. What do you think my chances are for getting an offer for September 2023? Because Humber is now literally my last chance for next Fall.\n\nThank you in advance",

I heard from someone that they got rejected for the same reason due to this and I think the college expects you to do so even if you don\u2019t have a history of arrears, as proof that you have none. So they resubmitted their application with the summary and got accepted. Anyway, congrats on Seneca!\ud83e\udd73",

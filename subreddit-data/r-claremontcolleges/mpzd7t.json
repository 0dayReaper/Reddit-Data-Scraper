    "postText": "i am currently in the process of deciding between pitzer and scripps. \n\nrn, i am leaning towards pitzer, though one concern that i have is that it is too cool for me. \n\nas incredibly cool as i am, while i enjoy being around the aesthetic and admire people who are, i am not hipster at all. i have also never been to a party and i don\u2019t smoke weed or plan to start. \n\nif there was any doubt of my insane level of coolness (spoiler: i am not cool), i will remedy that by describing one of the wild and fun ways i spend my free time: \n\nmy friends and i have a minecraft smp in which we are currently in the process of building a replica of the camarvan from the Dream smp, a minecraft role play server with intricate lore streamed on twitch. \n\nsince i often would rather stay in and chill than take advantage of the party scene, i am worried that pitzer might not be the right fit for me socially. \n\ni\u2019ve heard that scripps is more low key so i\u2019m thinking that could be better but i\u2019m not sure. \n\ni really like pitzer\u2019s vibe but i would also really like to not be lonely and friend-less lol. \n\nany advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!",

I\u2019ve never drank, never smoked weed, don\u2019t party, etc. I\u2019ve found my absolute best friends at Pitzer and none of us are into partying. My boyfriend and close friends have been doing a DND campaign over quarantine - that\u2019s how lame we are. I\u2019ve never felt out of place at Pitzer - while there are parties and stuff, nobody judges you if you aren\u2019t into it. I\u2019m sure you would find friends at both schools! Also, I\u2019d be happy to give you a tour or introduce you to some cool people in the fall if you\u2019d like! I don\u2019t know as many people at scripps but you can\u2019t go wrong either way",

Both also have a good proximity to Mudd, which also might be where you'd find some kindred spirits (especially East dorm?).\n\nScripps is indeed a very low-key, calm campus. At Scripps, I initially got placed with a bunch of cool partiers because of how I filled out my housing form (asked about cigarette smoking, which is probably no longer applicable), which was not my scene. But those parties they went to always happened on other campuses, so it's pretty easy to avoid if you're not into it.\n\nI found other people with my interests through classes, peer mentoring, 5C clubs, and later friends of friends. I met some Pitzer people through clubs that had a similar vibe, so I don't think all Pitzer people are \"too cool\" or into the party scene either.\n\nHopefully someone who went to Pitzer can comment with their perspective. \n\nFWIW, I was choosing between the same two school and went with Scripps because my college counselor felt Scripps was perceived as slightly more academically rigorous, but I think that was the wrong reason to differentiate between the two. I was ultimately happy with my choice of Scripps though.",

Honestly no one at the 5Cs cares if you spend your time gaming or drinking. Just do your thing and pick the school that has the better program for your major",

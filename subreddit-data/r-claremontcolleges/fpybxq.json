Union Station has a bunch of connecting transit throughout LA, but LA is wide and public transit is so-so. \n\nGetting to Santa Monica from Claremont takes:\n- 2+ hours by public transit (1 to Downtown, 1+ to Santa Monica)\n- 1 ~ 2 hours by car (depending on traffic, usually 1:20)\n\nIt's easy to get to LA, but there is always a ton of stuff happening on campus. Most of my friends on-campus only went to LA for big events like concerts.\n\nWhat makes you want to head to Santa Monica?",

Would go for big events (usually someone with a car would take me) and occasionally to visit friends living in LA proper (by train). 1-2 times/year first two years, maybe 4-5 during senior year when fewer classes and obligations. The train is pretty convenient and it's kinda cool to roll by people in car traffic. And yeah, enough to do on campus that I didn't really miss the city.",

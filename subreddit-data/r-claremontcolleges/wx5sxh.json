            "comment": "great question! \n\nwe can paint broad strokes but in all honesty you can find a little bit of each at each school, so take this with a grain of salt. \n\nbroad strokes: i think pomona tends to be the most diverse in terms of culture but goes more trad academic (as in people who study anthropology with the intention of becoming anthropologist\u2026 if that makes sense). cmc goes a little more normie centrist with over 25% of each graduating class majoring in economics. scripps goes more gay and students broadly tend to be more artsy and go on to earn less than students at the other colleges. it kind of depends on your idea of a fun time and how easy it will be to find that on your home campus. want to get drunk and party: easier to find at cmc. want to get high and paint watercolors: easier to find at scripps or pitzer. \n\nit\u2019s pretty much impossible to not interact with students from other campuses. cross-registering at other colleges is a given. \n\ndo you have any idea what you\u2019re looking for in particular? specific majors, activities (like camping, starting a band, living in a language hall, getting research published, living in a suite with friends, having a pet on campus, etc) that could help give a better scope to answer this question? it\u2019s kind of hard to describe different cultures without resorting to stereotypes. hope this helps!!",

Is there any advice that you'd provide to help position to get in?  I know good grades and activities are important, but is there any way to demonstrate proactivity?  Thank you.",

So Scripps and Pitzer are about to have a new building, the old building, and less students, but also less money. CMC is about to start from scratch and experience massive upheaval. So anyone\u2019s experience of studying bio chem or physics at Keck will not be super applicable to the future.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m beginning the college decision process and currently am really into the vibe of Pitzer and think I would really fit in and do well there. That being said, I\u2019m interested in majoring something biology/environmental which Mudd is of course more known for. Looking around online I see that the different colleges have students majoring in things that another 5c is better known for and focused on. I\u2019m just a little confused of how much it matters where I apply and end up going based on my desired major. If you can take a good chunk of your classes at any of the 5Cs then what makes for example CMC most desirable for political sci majors and Mudd desirable for STEM majors? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Yes, it matters. For one, although cross-registration is a thing, all the colleges have unique curriculums. If you went to Harvey Mudd, you would be in mandatory Core science and math classes for most of your first two years. If you went to Pitzer, you would have other kinds of social science/praxis course requirements but generally more choice about what to take. It's also not always easy to get into other schools' more popular classes, or even major at another school (for instance, computer science is becoming really challenging for a lot of students, and some majors are 1C only). In addition, if your school has a major, you're expected to complete it there instead of another 5C.\n\nVibe is important, and doing your research is also important! There's no reason you can't apply to every 5C you're interested in, but then you have to think about the majority of experiences you want to have, the type of people you will be closest to, etc. \n\nThat said, if you're interested in bio and environmental issues, Pitzer might be the best school to go to for the environmental analysis program.",

                    "comment": "Thank you, that makes a lot of sense. Based off what I can see, Pitzer and Scripp\u2019s curriculum focuses on a lot more choice/social sci while Mudd is core heavy. What is the Pomona curriculum like? It seems like Pomona would have a regular liberal arts curriculum based off its reputation of dedication to academia and that of a typical elite liberal arts college. \n\nMy second question is about the worth of Pitzer. Based off of nearly all the research I\u2019ve done it looks to me that Pitzer grads don\u2019t have the same high paying careers and just connections while still in school that the rest of the 5Cs have but with the same high tuition. I also saw some people saying that Pitzer is newly selective and if they play their cards right their endowment and other signs of grad success will greatly increase in the future, they just haven\u2019t had the time to show yet. Is this true in your opinion? Is Pitzer just newly selective and so hasn\u2019t had the time to display signs of grad success or is it just a high tuition with little return?",

You start with a critical inquiry seminar (\"ID-1\") that focuses on writing and research and then have six area requirements along with classes on analyzing difference, writing and speaking, and it's very open otherwise.\n\nI don't think Pitzer is \"newly selective\" any more than another college with applications increasing so drastically every year. Also, it may be a little harder to see direct lines from a Pitzer education to prestigious careers (however you define that) as it is for schools like Harvey Mudd and CMC, but I don't think anyone can really argue that Pitzer alums have any worse career prospects than another 5C. There are plenty in film/media, government/public policy, finance, environmental conservation, etc. just from what I'm aware of, and I don't know that much about their alumni base. In my opinion, your personal fit with a college and what you actually do there matter much more to your eventual success than people's perceptions of how good its outcomes are.",

            "comment": "I agree, as a Mudd alum, our core curriculum and remaining curriculum is quite different than what the other schools have. If you are not interested in things like math and physics, then you might find the core more trouble than it's worth.\n\nI think for biosciences any of the colleges will have options. CMC I know is in the process of expanding their science program to be competitive in STEM. Mudd will give you some extra quantitative skills compared to other schools. \n\nIf you are able to pay a visit (I think campuses are starting to open to visitors?) you can take a day or two walking throughout the campuses and get a sense of the vibe of each school.",

Do you believe it is reasonable to see 4 of the colleges in 2 days? I think we will check out Pomona, CMC, Harvey Mudd, and one more-- not sure which yet. Does this seem doable?",

It will be up to you to have a good idea of what is open on which campus and make plans accordingly. \n\nThe campuses are small enough that for sure you can do a very good walk through in two days while making time for any organized sessions. Doesn't take over 30 minutes to walk from northernmost to southernmost points on the colleges. Overnight stays and classroom visits would be a good thing to prioritize if offered and you are comfortable.",

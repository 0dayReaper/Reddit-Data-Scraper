    "postText": "Hello I am a senior from South Korea who is currently trying to ED1 CMC. Going through the Application Instructions for First-Year international applicants I found out that I need to take a writing assessment. Does anyone know if this was started from 2021 or did you guys have this assessment last year too? If so, can anyone give me a heads up about what they test me on? Also, it was written \"each applicant for whom English is not their first language or the language of instruction at their high school\". Currently, I am attending an international school in South Korea and the language of instruction at my high school is English. Would this mean that I don't have to take the short writing assessment or submit my English Language Proficiency Test scores? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone can answer my question it would be greatly appreciated :)",

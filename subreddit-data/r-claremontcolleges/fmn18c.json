    "postText": "Hi guys!\n\nI got into CMC yesterday and I wanted to know more how one would declare a major. I am currently a Government major; however, I still am wishy-washy on what I really want to do as a career and thought a LAC would be great in exploring different subjects. Doing more research online, I was intrigued at the Economics degree in the Robert Day school. Do I need to apply again to be a Robert Day scholar if I do major in Econ, and if so how rigorous is the application process? Additionally, how rigorous is the BA/MA application?\n\nAny answers would be great. Thanks again!",

However if you apply to RDS that application isn\u2019t until sophomore year so you will have plenty of time to decide if yo I want to apply. BA/MA is very rigorous academically but it is typically easier to get into because fewer people apply.",

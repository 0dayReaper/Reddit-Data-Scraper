    "postText": "I posted this to the HMC sub but thought I might post it here as well:\n\nHey everyone! I am currently a senior in high school and am deciding between Harvey Mudd and Northwestern for ED. I\u2019d say I am currently leaning towards Harvey Mudd but I (and especially my parents) have a few large concerns that would like to be addressed if possible.\n1. Is HMC really as stressful as it is made out to be? I\u2019ve heard the suicide rates are very high because of the pure pressure you are put upon at HMC with all of the grade deflation and stuff. I\u2019ve also heard that you won\u2019t really have time to do anything else (hobbies, exploring the city, etc) apart from your studies. Like to a point where you won\u2019t even have one free day a week to do whatever you want. Is this true?\n2. There is a very narrow field of study at HMC. It is basically CS (and a couple of engineering) majors only. As of now, I want to major in CS, but what if I changed my mind and wanted to major in let\u2019s say economics or data science instead? HMC doesn\u2019t offer these majors so would I not be able to graduate if that was the case? Or would I just have to grind out a CS degree even if it took a huge toll on me? Or would it be pretty easy to transfer to let\u2019s say CMC if I wanted to do economics instead?",

            "comment": "Would take everything the first reply says with a grain of salt, not sure if they've recently gone to Mudd, or had a child who went to HM, but seems like they don't have very accurate information. I'm a recent 5C grad, don't know if I heard of su\\*cide being a large issue at Mudd. During my time, CMC was more attached to that notion.   \nI don't think Mudd students don't have any free time at all, I had Mudd friends that definitely had time to explore the city, join extracurriculars, hang out with friends. I do think Mudd students are probably spending more time, on average, on their studies than the other 5Cs though.   \nYou can major in economics or something else Mudd doesn't have (without transferring) if it's available at another 5C -- just another perk of the Consortium. I think the only restriction is that you would have to minor in something that Mudd does have.   \nFinally, contrary to what the previous poster said, the coursework at Mudd is considered by a lot of employers, and Mudd graduates are typically very sought after. Hope that helps!",

You have the whole consortium's major offerings to work with.\n\n2) I know someone who went to Mudd the first year then transferred to Pitzer because they didn't want to go through with Mudd's required coursework. My perception is that transferring to another 5C from Mudd is very easy, but YMMV.",

A huge college workload will not help you in any way ever. Once you\u2019re out of college no one knows or cares how hard your classes were. As you point out, there are no options if you change majors. Go where you have more options. Most students change majors. What you think you\u2019d like and what you won\u2019t like at all might end up being the same thing.",

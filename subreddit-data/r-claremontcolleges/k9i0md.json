    "postText": "I\u2019m making this because I wish I had heard this before going into the college decision process. \n\nI had my heart set on Princeton - and I\u2019m so happy I ended up at Scripps. (I was deferred then rejected from Princeton\ud83e\udd2a) I got charmed by other schools\u2019 prestige, and I overlooked what Scripps (and the rest of the 5Cs) has to offer. (I love the dynamic of the 5Cs!)\n\nAs a first year at Scripps, I feel like all my teachers truly want me to succeed and like the Scripps community supports me. I\u2019m surrounded by motivated, intelligent students but have never felt a hint of a toxicly competitive environment. In fact, for being virtual, it feels like a pretty tight-knit group already!\n\nFor example, I\u2019m not particularly math-inclined, but I took Linear Algebra this semester, and my teacher encouraged questions, never made another student feel stupid, was amazing at explaining concepts, and offered extra office hours when asked. I had been afraid to take this class, but I loved it!\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions:) some HS stats below for anyone interested. FYI, I also applied regular decision to Pomona and was rejected. \n\n- GPA: 4.42 weighted (9 APs, considered full workload at my hs)\n- National Merit Finalist\n- Leadership and awards in newspaper (editor in chief, section editor, business manager)\n- Founded and ran school\u2019s a cappella club, Involved in chorus 4 years\n- 2 summers working for nonprofit, 1 summer working for tech start-up\n- other main schools I was deciding between: Barnard, Cal, UCLA, Wesleyan, and Tufts\n\nScripps also ended up being the best financial choice (of the private schools) for me as well, as they\u2019re generous with need-based and merit aid!",

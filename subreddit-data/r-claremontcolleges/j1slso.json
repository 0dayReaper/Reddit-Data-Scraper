    "postText": "I attend CGU, and I love hanging out with students from Pomona, CMC, and Mudd. Good times all around.   \n\n\nHowever, I often found myself going to the undergrad colleges and never seeing a role reversal. That made me question: Do the undergrads think CGU sucks (lol, but serious question at the same time)? Or are undergrads so entrenched in their A+ liberal arts studies that they don't have time to say what's up to us older folks?",

            "comment": "Most 5C students live their lives generally unaware that CGU exists unless they have a specific reason to interact with it (classes, extended MA program, lab, whatever). Many clubs are open to all 7Cs, and I've heard stories of CGU students participating in some (especially  the arts and music, where you might also see faculty/staff/community members there too). Of course, they might interact most in consortial spaces that CGU students usually use \u2013 the library, Tranquada programs, affinity groups, etc.\n\nIt's also important to know that college, like high school, is an important time to develop and grow around your peers, and that means being with people your age. I think as a grad student, if you're trying to enter more 5C-oriented spaces, you need to be sensitive to where you might be changing the social dynamics by being there. (This obviously depends whether you're, say, fresh out of undergrad and mid-twenties, or someone a little more seasoned) You should also expect that some of the culture might be unfamiliar and you probably don't want to take up space by making them accommodate you.",

Socializing is cool, but as a grad student, I don't see any reason to \"mix\" with students beyond a professional level. Your point about how 5C students \"live their lives generally unaware that CGU exists\" kind of points out how there is very little intellectual and academic trade between the colleges. There aren't even collegiate trades for TA-ship, internships, or professional developments. I think this could be improved upon if there's more interaction between the students and the graduate colleges.",

CGU and KGI are  resources that the colleges could benefit from probably just as much as vice versa. If you're interested in making that change, you might start by trying some outreach with your academic area and perhaps other departments would follow if it was successful!",

They love to invite students into their talks and events. However, I think it would be cool to have a student-led consortium of sorts where we trade thoughts.   \n\n\nI'll try to pitch it down the line!",

So it wasn't really a conscious decision, it was more just that the only time I really interact with grad students is if I do like a research study that one of them is running or something.",

            "comment": "As an undergrad, I don't think the others think that CGU sucks; it's just that there are more opportunities to engage with other undergrads than with grad students. We are mostly free to take classes at the other 5Cs, but obviously not at the grad schools, since we're not grad students. Being able to take classes at the other 5Cs helps us connect with each other. Also, I've even come across people who didn't know what CGU and KGI were until I told them (but to be fair, they were freshmen). Generally, I haven't seen many opportunities to interact with grad students other than participating in studies conducted by them or through TSL, which is where I often talk to a CGU student who happens to be on the editorial board. \n\nOn the other hand, I would absolutely love to interact more with more grad students and have talked to KGI students, but after talking to some grad students (in general, not in the 7Cs) about why they don't associate more with undergrads, I get the impression that a lot of grad students think we undergrads are, for a lack of a better word, immature. I definitely understand where they're coming from, since we're generally younger than them and don't have as much life experience, and perhaps because many grad students might be going back to school after years of working in a job and raising a family. I don't know if this is an attitude prevalent at CGU and KGI. However, it is why I sometimes hesitate to reach out to grad students unless they've expressed interest in socializing with us undergrads, as I don't want to come off as annoying or immature. \n\nIf you're interested in socializing with us, I'll be happy to message you and we can talk about it more there.",

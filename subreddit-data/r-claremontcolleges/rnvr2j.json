And are there on-campus jobs that provide these hours (strictly on campus since im an international)\n\n Thanks!",

And, if you can land a research position, that may not count as traditional work but may be paid \u2060\u2014 not super sure as research is mostly a STEM thing. Also, notetaking is a nice job if you have the ability.",

            "comment": "Technically all. But since Pomona has a name recognition and CMC focuses ONLY in finance/govt/economics, students from these two school will be required less work and worry less about getting into top firms (nothing is still promised thorough). But if you have the deliberate intention of getting in top consulting/IB firms from Pitzer/Scripps/Harvey mudd, it\u2019s possible since you can still rather (than other schools out there. Don\u2019t think inside the bubble) easily get an intern in this industry and still can attend to almost all of their affairs at 5C. You can find various examples on Linkedin. \n\nBy the way, less employees from the school does not specifically say that the school is not competitive enough for the firms- most of the time it\u2019s just that the students in that school are not particularly interested in IB or consultant for integrity and interest reasons.",

MBB also organize formal events open to CMC and Pomona students only. And by the way, I've checked Linkedin and all MBB people hire directly out of undergrad are from Pomona or CMC. To be honest. I feel like Pitzer Career Services is useless.",

To be fair, MBB do post jobs on Handshake, which is the 5C recruiting system. However, they only come to Claremont 1-2 times per year in the form of information sessions at Pomona and CMC campus (not open to other schools, sorry). If you go to Pomona or CMC, try to join the Consulting clubs (Pomona Consulting, Claremont Consulting Group) to network and practice case interviews. Claremont Colleges, maybe except for CMC, don't have a direct on-campus relationship like the Ivies or Top 20 National Universities.",

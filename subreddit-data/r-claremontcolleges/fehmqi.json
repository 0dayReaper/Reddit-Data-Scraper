However, the number of graduates who go to top banks or consulting firms (based on LinkedIn) is vastly different (CMC &gt; Pomona &gt;&gt; Pitzer). \n\nWhat makes this difference in your opinion? Where do most economics graduates from Pitzer go?",

I got the data from College Board's Big future website, which extracts data from Pitzer's Common Data Set. \n\nAlso my friend asked me: will Pitzer students still be able to major in CS at Harvey Mudd (when the Gregor Computer Science Center is finished) as she heard the situation now is pretty intense.",

I'm a Pitzer '23 and the comments above have some wrong answers.\n\n(note: my Pitzer experience has been awesome)\n\n1. The percentage of off-campus students over total UNDERGRAD students is 25%, according to the LATEST Common data set given BY PITZER ( [https://www.pitzer.edu/institutional-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2020/01/20200122\\_CDS\\_2019-2020\\_FINAL.pdf](https://www.pitzer.edu/institutional-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2020/01/20200122_CDS_2019-2020_FINAL.pdf) )\n2. Mudd currently still allows VERY FEW off-campus CS majors (1/10). So if you're from CMC, Scripps, or Pitzer and really want to major CS at Mudd, don't go to CMC, Scripps or Pitzer and go to Mudd or other schools outside of the 5Cs instead!",

Also you don\u2019t have to declare your major until the end of sophomore year (if I remember correctly) and you can still change your major any time after that point.",

They're looking for a person who is going to be a good fit, but also add something to community, rather than just someone who fits in with the schools stereotype. Good luck on your application! If you can come for an overnight, you should definitely try to, you really get to see what it's like to be a student here!",

It's not all grades and achievements, but rather how working towards those achievements has changed you or helped you grow, or how child/early adult experiences impacted you, that sort of thing, rather than just talking about grades and school. Let them get to know you as much as you can, and Branch out of what's already on your resume. Not that you can't talk about what's on your resume, but if you do, tell them why it's important to you :)",

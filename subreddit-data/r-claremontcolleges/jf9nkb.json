However, I know all 5cs are excellent for me about their location, atmosphere, and etc. SO I am wondering if I go to one 5c other than HM, could I get the same opportunity to do research in STEM fields?",

I do know some students (particularly from Pomona) who took a few CS courses at Harvey Mudd, but I think it would be difficult to take a multitude of classes there and find a professor to do research with as a non-Mudd student.",

If you're really really good at persuading professors, you can even take the Engineering Clinic. I have seen at least 1 Pomona and 1 Pitzer student did that.",

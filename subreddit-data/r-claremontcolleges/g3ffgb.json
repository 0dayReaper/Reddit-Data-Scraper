    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently an incoming freshman at CMC. When I visited the school, I instantly fell in love with the PPE program. It totally fits my educational ideologies and its orientation towards custom more individualized education is incredible. The admissions officers told my group that it wasn't a normal major and you had to apply into it, but I was fine with that. I like challenge.\n\nHowever, as I hear from more and more prospective CMC students, it seems like everyone and their mom wants to do PPE. On the accepted students' Instagram page, literally around half of people say that their intended major is PPE. I did more research and was shocked to see how few spots there actually are for the program. I feel like the admissions officers were kind of deceptive about how difficult it is to get into. They talk about it like it's this massive advantage the school has, which it is, but I'm not sure it's worth the hype and time spent discussing if literally .5% of an incoming class can enroll in it. This was kind of the selling point on CMC for me and I locked in ED so I can't get out now. Does anyone know how hard it actually is to get into? Anything helps.",

The percent of students accepted to PPE varies from year to year but usually way fewer students apply than you might expect based on the incoming class page. Feel free to reach out with any other questions about life at cmc!",

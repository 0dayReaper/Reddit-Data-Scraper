It's understandable to seek reassurance from peers, but I think this and your other questions boil down to \"it's fine\" and aren't adding a lot of value as individual posts. I'd encourage you to post these application questions as a single topic rather than multiple threads.\n\nI think many people can relate to college applications being a tense and hopeful period of their life. I'd encourage you to find someone you can speak to who can give you tools for managing college application stress. Best of luck.\n\nEdit: also please stop deleting your threads once someone does take the time to comment with an answer. I've seen several community members provide thoughtful responses, only to have that information disappear behind a deleted thread.",

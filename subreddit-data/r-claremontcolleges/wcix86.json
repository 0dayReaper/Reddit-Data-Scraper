    "postText": "Hey everyone. \n\nI'm interested to hear from those who have graduated with this degree or who are currently in the program, as I am greatly considering applying. Do you enjoy the curriculum? Is it what you expected? Was it worth the time/cost?\n\nFor some background on me, I graduated with a Public Policy degree this year. I minored in Education, had a focus on urban/environmental policy, and have an AS in Criminal Justice, so I have a pretty well-rounded and diverse education. With this MS I would like to research and solve practical problems in the fields that I have studied. I would love to eventually have an established career in research or policymaking, so that is why I am considering this degree. Right now I am a part-time intern at an environmental government agency and might (hopefully) also have a full-time/part-time job at a local law enforcement agency soon.",

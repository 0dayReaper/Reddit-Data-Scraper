    "postText": " I'm a high school senior and am currently in the process of applying to college. My first choice and ED school is Claremont McKenna. On the CMC website, it says \"one teacher LOR\", however on Common App, it says \"1 required\" and \"1 optional\". Additionally, I am able to request another teacher of a core subject to write a LOR on Naviance. I have two particular teachers that I believe would write stellar letters of rec for me, so I would really love to be able to submit two LORs to this college. Any help would be appreciated.",

This isn't my area of expertise, but I will say: your applications should probably look pretty different between Harvey Mudd and Pitzer, even if you emphasize bio for both. You should also think about what kind of curriculum you would feel most comfortable with and if you're committed to the bio track. HMC has a demanding science/math core that will take up most of your time for the first two years, while the majority of your Pitzer classes wouldn't even have to be in biology. \n\nAlso know that Pitzer's bio and other science majors are through the Keck Science Center, which is going through some changes right now because Claremont Mckenna is leaving and will probably take a good chunk of money with it. Still, I think it's well-liked and is supposedly getting a renovation.\n\nHere are some [FAQs about Bio at Harvey Mudd](https://www.hmc.edu/biology/programs-and-courses/biology-major-faqs/) and [Bio at Keck](https://www.kecksci.claremont.edu/majors/biology.asp) if you haven't come across them yet!",

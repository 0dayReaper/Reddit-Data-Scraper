            "comment": "In general you register for classes from any of the colleges through the same online portal, and for the most part you can sign up for off-campus classes as easily as on-campus classes.  However, some classes, usually especially popular ones, have restrictions on who can register for them, or have a limited number of seats available for off-campus students.  If you do an off-campus major you are supposed to have the same priority for classes as as someone from that college in that major by consortium rules.  \n\nEcon at CMC: is very hard if you're not a CMCer, even if you're majoring in econ at CMC.  This is not how it's supposed to work and goes against the consortium rules.  CMC's econ department is being kind of a dick about this.\n\nEA at Pitzer: relatively easy.  Intro EA is a popular-ish class, but I (Mudd) was easily able to sign up for it, and I know a bunch of other people that took it and took more EA courses.\n\nCS at Mudd: There is a separate spring offering of Mudd's intro CS course specifically for off-campus students.  I know there are a reasonable number of non-Mudders in the second class in the intro sequence but I don't know how hard it is to get in.  Beyond the intro sequence it's pretty much impossible unless you are a Mudd CS major or there are some seats in some classes for Pomona CS Majors.  However, there are a bunch of non-Mudders who major in CS at Mudd.  I don't know how hard it is to get approval to do that, but once you're a Mudd CS major you get the same registration priority regardless of what school you go to.\n\nOthers: no idea, but it's probably reasonably doable.",

That said, he did eventually get all of them, it was just a really frustrating process.",

    "postText": "Hi y\u2018all, would you describe any of the Claremont colleges as family friendly? Since I\u2019m about to re-enter the college world (in early twenties, my fianc\u00e9 is entering mid twenties) and we\u2018re planning to start a family sooner or later (I\u2018ll likely be in undergrad still), and I resonate with the 5Cs, I\u2018d love to get some insights. Have you heard of any mothers/pregnant students in the midst of their education? Is there any child care close to campus etc? Are married students an anomaly? How is the housing situation for couples (let alone small families)?  I\u2019d appreciate any answer, thank you for your time!",

            "comment": "I graduated in 1988, so this may be (wayyyy) out of date, but I never met undergrad students with a family.  I think one Mormon woman got married her junior year and moved off campus. Essentially 98% of students live on campus in dorms. Do not recall any family housing.",

I\u2019ve been advised to look for \u201cMormon\u201d schools, aka the BYU\u2019s, but they just don\u2019t align with my values and viewpoints (besides being family friendly). I would assume not much has changed regarding family housing etc. at the Claremont\u2019s.",

                    "comment": "Pitzer for example is a test-optional school, and since I graduated from a German Highschool, I have hitherto not undergone any standardized testing (should the need arise, I will, although I personally am not a proponent of such tests). I have also previously received college credits for a B.Sc. program at a German university, hence, I\u2019d likely be treated as a transfer student. \nBoth my HS and college GPAs are top percentile, although one should keep in mind GPA and other grade related criteria are not the sole factors leading to admission. Through my previous exposure to research, extracurriculars and internships (and life, after all one\u2019s maturity and character can provide - although, one might argue - vague insight into possible outcomes, should one be admitted) I personally have been able to gain valuable experience and insight possible \u201ccontestants\u201d that are younger than me might be lacking - although I am sure there are plenty of people that would probably be a more plausible choice, compared to my humble self, for any number of reasons.\nI am aware of the challenges that tend to come with the privilege of attending a school like Pitzer, especially regarding my individual circumstances of combining education, marriage, motherhood etc, and feel very equipped to master such trials whilst excelling at my studies and preparing myself for my ongoing journey post-undergrad. \nAt the end it will be a matter of multiple factors coming into play on whether competitive schools like the Claremonts offer me admission or not, but it will certainly not be due to a lack of trying on my part. Furthermore, anything is possible, so it doesn\u2019t hurt to shoot for the stars every now and then ;)",

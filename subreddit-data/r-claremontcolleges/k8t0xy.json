    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm going to start this off by saying that I'm currently a freshman at Claremont McKenna. This is about my personal experience and should not be generalized to everyone. For reasons that will become obvious in a minute, this is a throwaway account.\n\nMy experience with CMC has been actively bad. As of now, I've had four professors. One of them is outwardly racist and has assigned us racially inflammatory readings, one gave me a 0 on a paper because I didn't submit it in the format that he preferred, and one of them is simply unkind. The only professor that I've like so far is, ironically, a visiting professor. The other freshman have been awesome, but my professors have been so bad that it makes my experience at CMC painful. It seems that most of my professors care much more about their tenure and research than their students.\n\nThere have been countless examples of things that just don't feel right to me. During my tutoring sessions for econ, the tutors flashed the answer sheet in front of my face and left with no further explanation. I've reached out to my advisor for help but the advice I've received basically boiled down to \"suck it up\". When I've tried talking to my upperclassman peer mentors (or whatever it's called) about my experience, they have been unwilling to acknowledge my discomfort. I get answers like \"It can't be *that* bad\", or \"I'm sure your professors are trying their best\". There seems to be something in the student body culture that makes people uncomfortable with saying \"I'm having a tough time\". I deeply value acknowledging problems when they arise, so it's possible that I just would have been better off at a different school.\n\nI went to a liberal arts college because I wanted close relationships with my professors, but at this point, my professors have been so bad that I'm not sure how much more I want to foster relationships with them. An old high school classmate (who is considering applying) asked me how I've been liking school so far, and I couldn't bring myself to lie. I flat out told her I've been miserable because my professors have been awful.\n\nI have not been at CMC long enough to say the school as a whole has inherent flaws that lead to unempathetic professors, but what I am saying is that my time here has been terrible. I'm happy for the other people at CMC who have had great experiences, but that has just not been mine. I've decided to write this to voice what both I and, I believe, other students feel. Negative experiences do exist at Claremont McKenna, and, although most are positive, I think it's important and healthy to acknowledge that not everyone is in love with CMC.",

            "comment": "As Nerdwithoutausername said, you need to talk with DOS and get in touch with their staff. Sean Rollolazo specifically is a fantastic resource. I struggled academically my first semester and since then I've have a weekly meeting with Sean for 3 semesters now. He's connected me to so many resources and help that is available on campus. You can also report your racist professor to the DOS office and they can forward your experience up to the Vice President for Student Affairs.\n\nI'm not sure what your major is, but if you are Econ then DOS can link you with a personal, one-on-one tutor to help you with your future Econ courses. I was able to receive a personal peer tutor whom I met with for both of the Econ courses I was struggling in. For one of my courses, ECON 150, no personal peer tutor existed so the DOS Office asked my professor for the student with the highest grade in my course and paid him to tutor me. There are people and resources on campus who care and genuinely want to help you. \n\nI'm sorry you haven't had the best experiences with professors. I can sympathize, as I was an Economics-Accounting major until I took one professor whom I hated which forced me to make the switch to Government. I would say that most of the professors I have taken so far though have been very kind and understanding so I would try not to let this experience jade your perception of CMC faculty. I encourage you to speak to peers about professors for recommendations going forward. If you are not comfortable talking to your FYGs for recs, then you are welcome to talk to me and I can ask around for you.\n\nSpeaking of FYGs, I find it troubling that yours were unwilling to acknowledge your discomfort (as it is their entire job). I would urge you to contact the First Year Programs staff/FYG Core about your FYGs, as they should not be FYGs if they are unable to help you.",

            "comment": "Hello, I am sorry that your first semester of college did not go as well as you would like. I am a current sophomore at CMC. My first semester did not go well either, so I understand your frustration. Have you talked to someone from the Dean of Student Office about your professors? I can refer you to someone at DOS if you need any help with this. \n\nTutors (especially for econ 50) are expected by students to give out answers during their tutoring session. I am sorry that your econ tutors had only provided you with answers without explaining the material better. \n\nIronically, academic advisors at CMC are usually pretty bad at giving out academic advice. You should consider changing your advisor if you feel like the relationship is not strong between you and your advisor. Let me know if you need help with this!\n\nSorry that your FYGs had failed to acknowledge your discomfort. If you need anyone to talk to, I am always available! This can be about CMC, 5Cs, college in general, or anything you want!",

            "comment": "CMC has that pre-professional, competitive vibe. It's not for everyone. Since you took Econ, that vibe clearly exhibits.  \nRegarding racist professors, I think that's because CMC has the most \"conservative\" leaning out of like any universities and colleges in California (The Claremont Independent has the most funding from CMC) In addition, the school is proud of its \"free speech\": you can say anything including hateful comments. If you dislike that, consider transferring to other Cs.",

I have had one very bad experience with an Econ prof, which actually turned me off from the major entirely (I was already not super stoked about the subject, the prof was just the nail in the coffin). My advice? Branch out, take different classes, maybe even at a different college. I adored my experiences at the different schools and have since not had a bad prof. Also echoing what the other commenters have already said. Reach out to DOS, report your racist prof, and find a support system stronger than what you currently have.",

            "comment": "I echo what people said above about reaching out to DOS. I also want to say that if one of them doesn\u2019t help, there\u2019s more to go to. Over the years, each student finds a Dean they trust and can go to whenever they\u2019re having issues, so don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re stuck with the first one you speak to. I also recommend taking classes at the other colleges. Those have been my favorite and overall, I\u2019ve connected better with those professors. Higher level Cmc classes like seminars do get a little better in my personal experience. As for the racism you can also reach out to Nyree Gray (she\u2019s been leading anti-racism efforts with the faculty) or Dean Wiley (academics). But your experience is very valid and I\u2019m sorry that you had to experience all that during your first semester. I hope your second semester goes better!",

    "postText": "My parents made over 200k for the first time last year and they have saved a lot for retirement, however they can't afford to pay 70k a year as my sister is in college too and they don't want to retire at 75. \n\nWe've discussed how high of a cost of attendance is reasonable, and decided that they will cover 30-35k a year. Does anyone know / have experience with how much aid CMC or Pomona give to students in my situation?",

Looks like you should expect between $20,000-$30,000 in aid. \n\nYou can also use their [net price calculator ](https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/claremontmckenna) for a more accurate estimate based on more than just annual income, like siblings, assets, etc.",

You should definitely still apply if you're interested and see what the financial aid office offers you. \n\nBest of luck with your college search! It's a stressful time but things tend to work themselves out one way or another.",

You just have to explain that your family contribution won't be over 35k and they'll take that into consideration. Definitely still apply because there's lots of scholarship opportunities!",

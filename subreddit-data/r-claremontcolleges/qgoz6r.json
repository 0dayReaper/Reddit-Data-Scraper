    "postText": "So to clarify I want to study any in the data science/computer science area but I highly doubt I could get in anywhere besides Pitzer, so my plan is to try get in there and end up taking my classes at the other schools which have courses in that degree. I\u2019m from South Africa, and I visited the 5C\u2019s this summer and loved all the campuses A LOT! Any advice would be appreciated. Even if you think this is a bad idea, I want to hear why.",

've heard of people who have gone to Pitzer to either do just that or to try to transfer into Pomona, CMC, or HMC and it almost never goes well.  Going to Pitzer in an attempt to take classes at other schools is not a great strategy for 1. career options (employers won't know which school you take classes at) and 2. general happiness. If you really have your heart set on one of the 5Cs, then ED to that one. I would only recommend EDing to Pitzer if you really believe that the school in isolation is best for you",

You can (and should) make it clear on resumes and in interviews that your major was via HMC in that case.  People in tech know HMC. I will ask my buddies what they did on their resumes and stuff",

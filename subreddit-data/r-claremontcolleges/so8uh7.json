I would not recommend calc ii or iii. I would also not recommend logic. A lot of folks recommend it cause it\u2019s different than a lot of math courses in terms of not needing to do arithmetic / algebra so much, but I\u2019ve heard a few people say it\u2019s actually difficult if you\u2019re not a math person.",

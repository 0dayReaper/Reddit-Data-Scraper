Both are great choices.",

            "comment": "As other posters have said, Media Studies is intercollegiate. Some have suggested going to a school that specializes in film production. \n\nI would suggest really thinking about going to film school. Sure, it\u2019s going to teach you the technical aspects of filmmaking but you can literally teach yourself most of what you\u2019d learn by using internet resources. [This post ](https://joshua-caldwell.medium.com/film-school-is-a-giant-waste-of-your-time-and-money-437dc55cf2c2) does a great job talking about why that might not be a good idea. \n\nIf you want to do media studies, I would recommend getting a double major in order to inform the types of stories/media you\u2019d want to focus on. Pitzer is the most flexible for double majors.",

    "postText": "**Pitzer BSDO w/ WesternU Health Sciences**  \n**Pros**  \n\\- 7-year BSDO program would mean I get my DO at the age of 25 which is nice, this is a program that only accepts 6 people each year so I am extremely lucky to get in  \n\\- guaranteed a spot in Western U medical school (ranking is about 94-120 out of \\~190) if I meet very basic requirements for MCAT and GPA, meaning that I might not have to go through the whole application process  \n\\- will not have to struggle over choosing classes or finding internships since everything is basically set for all 3 years of college, even summers are all planned out (ex. Taking classes on campus 1st-year summer, going to Costa Rica to intern 2nd-year summer)  \n\\- location, CA is closer to home and warmer, part of the Claremont schools  \n**Cons**  \n\\- a less academic environment  \n\\- restrictive, basically have no chance of going to a better or different medical school  \n\\- It is a DO program, not MD. As much as I do love it, it is still more restrictive than MD since MD medical schools tend to require higher academic performances and often have more freedom when choosing which specialty they want for residency\n\n**Carleton College**  \n**Pros**  \n\\- great student dynamics, people are known for not being competitive to the point that it is toxic, I heard everyone is super friendly  \n\\- undergraduate teaching is one of the best, all classes taught by professor  \n\\- great pre-med counselor and alumni system and apparently I heard medical schools like students from Carleton  \n\\- more prestigious than Pitzer  \n**Cons**  \n\\- freezing, far, food might not be that good  \n\\- getting an A is very difficult (but medical schools are supposed to know this so IDK if it's a con...)  \n\\- I might risk not being able to get into a medical school at all or end up in a medical school not even as good as WesternU. I perhaps might even have to take a year off just to apply to medical schools like a lot of people do. Most people apply to about 25+ medical schools, get interviewed to about 3-4, and then get into maybe 1.  \n\\- kinda related to the last one, but I will have to spend a lot of time trying to find internships and research opportunities  \n\\-most likely the regular 4 years graduation instead of 3 years  \n\n\nSorry for making it super long, thank you so much in advance if you could provide some advice.",

Over the past decade the process and landscape has changed a lot for DO's. It's also difficult to decide if med school is worth it. Of my freshman 100 person pre-med cohort I think 10 are in med school right now -- about 5 MD &amp; 5 DO.",

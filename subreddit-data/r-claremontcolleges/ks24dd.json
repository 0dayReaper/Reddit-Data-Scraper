I made friends by going to clubs (there are some online, happy to point you towards a few, I\u2019m more familiar with Pitzer ones tho) and I became friends with my suitemates and people living on my hall. Becoming more involved on campus second semester really helped me meet more people and feel more confident. A lot of people are also struggling with this, so you\u2019re not alone.",

Orientation Adventure is where I made my good friends at Pomona, but there will be many ways to make friends on campus\nAnd while school's online-only, set up a LinkedIn and connect with other people in your class/in Claremont if you haven't already. Just send them a note with the connection like \"Hi ___, I'm a freshman at the 5Cs and would love to connect\"",

I think you really have a lot to look forward to with the social life returning to \u2018normal\u2019",

Worst case scenario, take it from me: every year since freshman year I've mostly been in senior friend groups where they all graduate and leave, and each year I've come back in the fall and been able meet new incredible people to hang out with. Currently on a leave of absence (fuck online class lol) but happy to talk via pm if you have any questions.",

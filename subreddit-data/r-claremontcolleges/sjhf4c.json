GEs you would definitely take at PZ and expect those to be 1/3 of your classes or something like that",

Like /u/DreSheets said, you\u2019d need to take some GEs at Pitzer but can take classes for your off-campus major anywhere you choose so long as there is room. CS at HMC is the only dept I\u2019ve heard of being overburdened enough to limit outside enrollment.",

            "comment": "Little late but chiming in as a current sophomore at Pomona majoring in CS. In general I would say that breaking into the CS departments at each of the respective departments is difficult even for native students, let alone off campus students. There is a huge demand for CS coursework which remains unmet by the 5Cs. Pomona for exmaple is still struggling with offering the necessary classes for majors, and is currently looking for new CS faculty members. The department is unique in its pre-pre-registration process, in which majors must fill out a form stating the courses they need and are interested in taking in the next semester, and then students are placed into courses based on making sure everyone can fulfill major requirements, all before pre-registration even opens. CS majors are guaranteed completion of their requirements, but not minors due to excess demand.\n\nRegardless, majoring is difficult but possible. To major at Mudd as a Pitzer/CMC/Scripps student, you need to take intro CS (CS005) at Mudd spring freshman year, which you can only get into via perm. Failing to do so will mean you will not be able to major at Mudd. As a non-Mudd student, you spot in the intro sequence (CS5, CS60, CS70) is not guaranteed until you declare the major (significantly earlier than you would need to otherwise, around winter of your sophomore year). I personally know one or two Scripps students who are CS majors at Mudd, so its definitely possible, but still difficult given that there is already so much demand at Mudd.\n\nOn the Pomona side, I had difficulty breaking into the intro sequence (and I skipped CS51 because of AP credits) with my perm not being approved until the second week of the semester. CS62 was less competitive to get into because most of the competition is entering the sequence. CS51 and CS54 at Pomona require a Perm if you are not a Pomona student, and they often fill up with Pomona students even before registration is over. To declare at Pomona, you should finish CS54 in sophomore fall, and be in CS62 sophomore spring, so that you can declare before the end of your sophomore year. Its possible to be in CS54 sophomore spring and still declare, but you registration for the necessary classes (62 and 101) will be difficult.\n\nWithin the last few years, CMC has begun to offer an introductory CS sequence, but those classes are under the perview of the math department (which is actually pretty good at CMC)  and it ultimately only adds up to equivalent of a minor. Completion of those classes will not allow you to major at either Pomona or Mudd. Registration for that sequence is also pretty competitive.\n\nIn short, you do have a couple of options on how you want to go about this, with possible paths at both Pomona and Mudd. I would suggest you go for both paths during registration, although you will also have more chances at Pomona. While nothing is guaranteed, its possible if you are persistent and lucky. Wishing you best of luck either way!",

It\u2019s definitely challenging and getting tougher \u2060\u2014 Pomona is an easier place to major in CS though. I do know Scr and Pit CS majors though, so definitely a thing!",

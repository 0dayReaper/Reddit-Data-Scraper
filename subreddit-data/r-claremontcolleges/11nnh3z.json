    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm an international student that got into Pitzer by ED. I got predicted a 35+2 extra points from EE and TOK in IB. I'm kinda worried if I would get rescinded by Pitzer if my final exam scores lets say 5 points below my predicted score ( But I'm pretty confident that its going to be either a 3+ or 4 point drop overall). \n\nPlease help!!! I'm kinda worried because this week is the mock, and I did super shit for math.",

    "postText": "I'm a college student from Boston (Northeastern) interning in the Bay Area this semester, and I'm visiting a friend at Scripps on Saturday, January 25th. While talking about logistics of meeting up (I'm arriving in the morning from an overnight bus), we started joking about the [boombox scene from Say Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5Y8tFQ01OY)\n\nYou may see where this is going. For those of you who don\u2019t know it and don\u2019t care to watch the video, it\u2019s the scene where high school John Cusack stands outside a girl\u2019s window holding a boombox over his head as it plays \u201cIn Your Eyes\u201d by Peter Gabriel.\n\nOf course, considering she has neighbors, the plan is that she leaves a bluetooth speaker on her windowsill overnight, and then I connect my phone from outside and stream \"In Your Eyes\" directly into her bedroom when I get to Claremont.\n\nThat being said, I figured it would be funny if I held up a boombox anyway (just for the look. It wouldn't be playing anything), so if someone has one that I could use for about 20 minutes around 9am on Saturday, January 25th, please dm me.\n\nNow, as I was coming up with the idea to petition reddit for a boombox, I realized exactly which population of people I was asking this to. So if you have boombox access (or access to boombox sized cardboard you could draw on), and would like to join for a silent Say Anything flashmob, please dm me. If any of your friends would like to join a silent Say Anything flash mob at around 9am on Saturday, January 25th, please dm me.\n\nNow, I would like to keep this a surprise, but at the same time, I don't want to reveal her information all over the Internet. So, since I've already said that this is for a Scripps student, I ask that y'all please do not tell any Scripps students, because if you tell a Scripps student, there's a chance it could be her.",

Does your friend love Scripps?  We are from Wash DC area.  We visited 5Cs last year and loved campus.  She never got a chance to visit BU and doesn't know Boston.  She likes the smaller classes of the 5Cs.  Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",

                    "comment": "I don't go to BU, so I have to start with the obligatory \"Sucks to BU!\"\n\nJust saw your comment so I'll reach out to my friend at Scripps. I can't comment on the classes or culture at BU, but I'll give my thoughts on Boston.\n\nIf your only metric is the aesthetics of the campus, Scripps wins, hands down. BU has some pretty spots, but overall, it's a nowhere close to any of the Claremont schools based on looks. And obviously, the weather in Boston is much worse than SoCal. I doubt there's a lemon tree anywhere in Massachusetts (Scripps owns a couple trees that students can just take fruit from, so I'm told).\n\nThe metric where BU wins is location. As a college student, getting around Boston is extremely easy (and personally, Allston, one of the main neighborhoods by BU, is my favorite part of Boston). Boston also has more variety in extracurricular activities. In part because BU is a bigger school, and in part due to the 150,000 or so students in the Boston area. One critique that my friend at Scripps had was that, while Scripps/5C was nice, it was really hard or far to get anywhere.\n\nThe biggest difference I picked up was pace. Boston is more fast paced, and much more is happening at any given time, while Scripps is much more laid back. Personally, I like the fast pace of being in Boston, but that's me.",

My daughter is also a city kid but she does want a campus.  We went to visit Pomona last year (we toured Pomona and Claremont Mckenna - just walked thru Scripps)  She applied ED to Pomona and did not get in.  So applied to Scripps.  We are in DC now.  Yes, would be interested to hear if your friend is happy at Scripps.  My daughter isnt a partier but very outgoing and loves to have fun.  She plays soccer and lacrosse and is very in to musical theatre and singing.What year is your friend?  Does she ever go in to LA?",

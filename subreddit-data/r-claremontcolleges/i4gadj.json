    "postText": "I'm currently very conflicted because I had committed to Mudd but recently got off the waitlist at CMC where I would be doing their economics and engineering dual degree program with Mudd. Not many people know much about the program so I don't know how feasible it is. I love Mudd and the core curriculum but I also had wanted to double major in public policy which I understand is an impossible task to pair with engineering at Mudd (much of the policy and econ requirements overlap). Does anybody have any advice or know anything about the dual degree program?",

            "comment": "It\u2019s a tough position to be in both are great options. If you were to attend Mudd and major in engineering it would be near impossible to double major in public policy, but a concentration is certainly feasible. CMC\u2019s program would allow you to double major in the two subjects but it would require an extra year of college and, by extension, a full-year\u2019s tuition. I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that the majority of people who plan on doing these 5 year programs at CMC and similar institutions often don\u2019t go through with it for various reasons. Usually it\u2018s because it\u2019s tough to leave your friends after 3 years of college together. If you plan on spending the 2 years at Mudd that\u2019s not much of a problem but you will be left behind in a sense as many of your friends will graduate before you. Also, Mudd will be in person this coming semester while CMC will be fully online. There\u2019s a lot to keep in mind when making such a big decision but just know there is no \u201cwrong choice\u201d here.",

            "comment": "Sorry this response is so late. \n\nI'm currently doing the dual degree program and I say, if you can handle the workload and love engineering, absolutely go to Mudd. \n\nI love the Keck Science Center, but the infrastructure there is complete garbage. There's one \\*single\\* advisor for all three colleges who handles every single student in the 3-2 program as well as several other physics majors. You can totally major in PP as well if you focus your HSAs on it and are very committed, which I think you are. For reference, one of my best friends is double majoring in mathematics and Chicano/Latino studies as a student at Mudd (CLS major is at Scripps), and he is having no trouble with credits. \n\nBest of luck, and I hope you've figured this out by now!",

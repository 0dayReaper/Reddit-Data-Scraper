    "postText": "I'm an upcoming senior in high school and Claremont Mckenna is really good fit for me academically. But I am not interested in partying whatsoever, and I heard that CMC has an overwhelming party culture. Of course, many schools do, and while I'm okay with some partying, I don't want an overwhelming party culture. For those of you who attend CMC, how is the party scene like (and your general experience as well)?",

            "comment": "Yes, CMC has quite a big party culture, probably the biggest among the 5Cs. However, many other students (myself included) are also not super crazy about partying, so you can always seek out these people and just ignore the parties. And of course, you can always hang out at the other 4 colleges whenever need a breather from CMC :) ",

                            "comment": "Parties are more like things that I'll check out briefly, especially if someone asked me to go with them. So I guess no, they didn't really impact my experience in any significant way, although they are an integral part of a college experience, so I try to go to them just to know what they're like. To be honest, I haven't exactly found my \"group\" (I have my reasons for this, one being that I'm deaf so it's a lot harder to make friends), but I know a lot of people who love CMC, not for the parties, but because of the students and opportunities available here. There's a lot of things you can do beside partying, and if you go after these things then you're bound to find people like yourself. One example I'll give is that I'm a mentor for the Asian and Pacific American Mentoring program, which is where upperclassmen act as mentors for incoming students who identify as Asian. It's a good way to meet people with similar backgrounds, and we do fun events together, which of course doesn't necessarily have to be partying. There's a lot of other organizations, clubs, and ways to be involved on campus and I think the consortium system is really unique in that you're able to have experiences typical of a liberal arts college and that of a larger university (and also having 7 dining halls to choose from is quite nice as well). So I guess what I'm trying to get at is don't let my experiences discourage you, because I'm in the minority, and I know a lot of people who are thriving here and have found their group, and they've done this not just purely through partying. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

I'm a molecular biology major so I've taken most of my classes through the Keck science dept that's shared with Pitzer and Scripps. In general, classes here are quite small, meaning that professors are accessible during office hours. Most professors that I've had were good at teaching and passionate about what they do. ",

I'm not a big partier, and while almost everyone else parties more than I do, I find that I'm rarely judged for my choices in regards to partying. CMC is definitely the most party-heavy Cmont college but it's pretty easy to avoid if you're not into it. ",

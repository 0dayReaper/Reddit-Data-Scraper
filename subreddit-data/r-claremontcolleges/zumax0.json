            "comment": "\neverything on campus is closed atm but honestly just walk around scripps, cmc, and pitzer if you wanna get a feel for them\u2014 hmc and pomona are kinda boring campuses imo and the most interesting place on hmc (the makerspace) is closed over the break. also pomona is a bit of a maze imo. they\u2019re def brilliant schools that are worth looking into but i\u2019m not personally a huge fan of their campuses\u2014 although some people really like pomona and hmc has an (unfortunately closed) underground tunnel system which is neat.\n\non the scripps campus i recommend going to the rose garden (on the right hand side of toll hall if you\u2019re facing the entrance) and try peeking into the margaret fowler garden (right in front of kimberly hall)\u2014 it\u2019ll be closed but it\u2019s super pretty and there are places you can peek through. also the outside of the garrison theatre is super pretty. honestly the whole campus is beautiful and it\u2019s worth just walking around.\n\nidk as much about the other campuses bc i go to scripps (like i take classes at other places but i spend most of my time at scripps and mudd which is not as nice of a campus). the pitzer campus is pretty though\u2014 especially if you\u2019re not from SoCal\u2014 and i recommend just looking around the area near fletcher hall and avery hall (those are the names i remember). they have a bunch of succulents and confusing signs near there. \n\nas far as cmc goes, i mostly just recommend seeing the cube because it\u2019s a super neat structure. i personally like the architecture in that area a lot and they also have some really cool benches (sounds lame but they\u2019re like works of art). i typically avoid cmc other than that area though so i don\u2019t know if super well. \n\nif you do decide to visit pomona and hmc, i can\u2019t really tell you much about pomona since i basically only go there to get to the village but i can tell you about hmc. the campus isn\u2019t the prettiest but they have a lot of chalk on the walls of the dorms and i feel looking at that can tell you about the culture of the school. i also recommend peeking into the drinkward lounge since it\u2019s a pretty nice area and they have a HUGE chalk board that\u2019s filled with a bunch of stuff. and they have a wall of memes. the shanahan center is also cool looking but it\u2019s just a huge glass building with a bunch of classrooms and a starbucks.\n\nfeel free to message me if you have any questions about the schools, especially scripps (and i have a lot of friends at harvey mudd so i know a decent amount about hmc too). i honestly love it at the 5Cs and going to scripps is one of the best decisions i\u2019ve ever made.\n\ntl;dr\u2014 rose garden + peek into margaret fowler for scripps, the general classroom area (near avery and fletcher hall) for pitzer, the cube and surrounding area for cmc, and hmc and pomona have less interesting campuses. also message me with any questions if you want.",

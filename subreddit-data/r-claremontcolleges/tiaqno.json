    "postText": "Yesterday I got accepted to both Pitzer and UCLA. \n\nAfter touring Pitzer, it became my dream school\u2014 it seems like a perfect fit: I love the vibes and the culture and the ethos. I also really like the Environmental Analysis Major.\n\nThe only complication is that I just got into UCLA. Tbh, I never thought that I even had a chance at UCLA. I also never loved the idea of going to state school because of large classes and impersonality and that feeling hasn\u2019t gone away. \n\nAt the same time, UCLA is still \u2728UCLA\u2728 and it\u2019s hard to turn that down. I am 100% talking about the prestige here. Having UCLA on your resume is something that follows you and opens doors. This is something that Pitzer just doesn\u2019t have, really the opposite. \n\nI know I would like Pitzer\u2019s culture more and that I would probably have a better and more fun undergrad experience, but I would love if you could convince me that I wouldn\u2019t be making a huge mistake if I choose my college based on those factors. Help me justify it to myself (And also partially my parents. It\u2019s ultimately my choice, but my parents really like the idea of me going to ucla). \n\nCould you specifically touch on how big of an issue the low endowment is and the lack of name recognition in terms of job prospects? Also, socially and culturally, how is the experience being know as the \u201cbad\u201d claremont college (this is something that my cousin who goes to scripps said might be an issue). \n\nThanks so much!!",

            "comment": "Hey there u/frank_stethoscope_4\n\nPZ grad here. Congrats on getting into two amazing schools!\n\nBack when I was a high school senior, I was in a similar boat-- had to decide between going to Pitzer or NYU. Funny enough, I had a very similar background to you where it became my dream school after going for Diversity Weekend and touring around, and I also applied as an EA major. Ended up graduating with a triple major in OS, Psyc, and English. Very grateful that I was able to explore and change my majors twice.\n\nGoing to a state school was something that I did not want to do, with the similar belief that I would just be a number in a large lecture hall, I wouldn't be able to develop connections with my profs, and that it'd be hard to find a community. I don't know enough about UCLA to provide you with any insights there, but I can say that I never experienced any of those problems at Pitzer.\n\nThe largest class size I was ever in was a 36 person Intro to Psychology course, which was mostly frosh dominated, Really, it felt like it was a class a lot of people took to figure out if they wanted to actually major in psychology or not. Otherwise, most of my classes were about 14 students, with the lowest being an eight person class. Because most classes at Pitzer are smaller after the intro classes, a good amount of them are seminar based. It was a great way to feel like my voice was valued and mattered as much as my profs', and I really appreciated all of the profs who came in with the mindset that they could learn from me as much as I could learn from them. I still talk to several of my profs several years post-grad, one of which I send a Christmas text to every year.\n\nIn terms of resume prestige, I totally get your perspective about having UCLA on your resume (it was how I felt about giving up NYU on my resume), but I would argue with you when you say Pitzer just doesn't have it. While UCLA does have a larger global footprint, having Pitzer and the 5Cs on my resume has helped me, and the people who know the Claremont Colleges are people who \"get it\" -- it being what having a 5C college experience entails. Might be some weak examples, but my first company's original office was based in Santa Monica and my manager spent 11 years in the LA area. I was the only kid applying for an internship coming from a liberal arts school, and him having known about the 5Cs from his time in LA, he knew how prestigious they were, how difficult they were to be admitted into, and how great the academic experience was. Second manager at at tech start up went to Otis School of Art in SoCal. Same thing, he knew about the 5Cs, I was one of only three students in an intern class of 25 who came from a SLAC (the Uni recruiter liked that), and he liked my background because of the same reasons as the previous manager. That internship turned into a full-time job. My current manager at another tech startup went to Swarthmore who ended up getting a Masters and PhD later on (knew about the 5Cs because they're well regarded among academics), was excited that I was another SLAC graduate, and we were able to bond over the similar values that PZ and Swarthmore share. While PZ might not have the global brand name like UCLA, saying that it doesn't have any prestige is really undermining what Pitzer is, what it represents to people who will see it on a resume, and what a PZ student offers based on their academic and college backgrounds that extend beyond just a name on a pdf.\n\nIf you think Pitzer's culture aligns more with you and that you would have a more fun undergraduate experience, I don't deny that your feelings may be right. There's a sign on one of the walls on campus with the saying \"You are of this place -- it is changing you.\" I admit that pre-Pitzer I was a highly stressed, extremely type-A person with poor mental health, and Pitzer helped me become a better, healthier person because of how open, accepting, and vocal the student body is in making sure these issues aren't swept under a rug. They're openly spoken about, and between students, faculty, and administration, I was able to receive a lot of support I don't think I would've gotten from any other school.\n\nIn terms of the low endowment, understandably in comparing to the other 5Cs, Pitzer does have the lowest. It's the newest Claremont College, and with many students going in with a social justice/social activist frame of mind, post-grad jobs don't have high starting salaries like people who's first jobs are in IB, PE, etc. I will say, while Pitzer still holds that same frame of reference in its teaching and core values, myself and many of my classmates did not pursue nonprofit/social work, and we're doing comfortably post-grad now.\n\nLastly, in terms of being the \"bad Claremont College,\" this notion is archaic and frankly the people who promoted this during their time in Claremont just came across as extremely elitist and condescending. Each college has its own positives and negatives, something I feel confidently saying having taken classes and making friends at each of the schools. I knew people on campus who were accepted to Pomona, CMC, and Scripps, but rejected from Pitzer. Pitzer, like the other Claremont Colleges, looks closely at fit in reviewing applications, and if someone only got into Pitzer, it's likely because they most closely aligned with the school. I also find the comment funny because I knew people at the other schools who definitely fit into the \"hippie vibe\" that people still associate with Pitzer more than students at Pitzer and \"finance bros\" one would expect at CMC as part of the PZ student body, and I think it shows how the communities at each of the schools are interesting, diverse, and a collective consortium to really meet people from all walks of life.\n\nI hope this helps inform you prior to making your decision. While I won't say my time at PZ was entirely amazing (usual friend drama, issues with mental health, etc.), I have no regrets in having chosen PZ and I'm incredibly grateful for the people I met, the lessons I've learned, and the experiences I had that I don't think I could've had if I had attended any other school.",

            "comment": "In my experience a lot of people who get into T20s also get into Pitzer and decide to go there. I'm headed to Pitzer in the fall--i was waitlisted at UCLA and Occidental--and I'm about 95% sure I will go to Pitzer even if i get off of the UCLA waitlist. In terms of prestige, yeah more normie people know UCLA...but in the professional and academic world, Claremont Colleges are very well known and respected. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt comes down to what you want. Do you want to go a large school where your a small fish in a big pond? Do you want to compete for research? Classic big state college experience with lots of clubs and Greek life? That's more UCLA...Although, if it came down to campus style and d\u00e9cor...Id choose UCLA lol because it literally looks like Hogwarts. However, do you want a more personalized experience with lots of research opportunities and really close your peers/faculty? Do you want a very progressive and social advocacy based experience? Then Pitzer College is for you. \n\nAlso, where do you live? Are you in California? One of the reasons I always loved UCLA was because it is literally 15-20 mins away from where I live--Los Feliz, Los Angeles. Just know Claremont is a classic \"college town.\" I used to go to UMASS Amherst and Hampshire College about 10 years ago and Claremont reminded me a lot of Northampton MA. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a sociology and media studies major so having the chance to take classes at 4 other schools really appealed to me. I know everyone says this but the prestige of a college really doesn't matter once you get out of high school or community college. Go where you feel comfortable and at ease. Goodluck and hopefully we run into each other at either Pitzer or (very unlikely lol) UCLA!",

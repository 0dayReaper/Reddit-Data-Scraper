My academic advisor, I met with like 4 times total but she was always very supportive and helped me get appropriate accommodations. If you email any professor, they\u2019re almost always willing to meet even if you\u2019re not in their class. We also have a career service center where you can talk to other students or staff. You can also connect with alumni or parents in your professional field.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm looking at applying ED2 to either CMC or Pomona. I'm looking at studying finance/business, or something related to economics (but not pure economics); as well as maybe double-majoring or minoring in political science. The PPE (Philosophy, Politics, and Economics) major at Pomona looks incredible, but I CMC has more finance/business related majors that I am interested in (since it has the Robert Day school), in comparison to Pomona, for which I am only interested in the PPE major. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also know that Pomona is more competitive in both RD and ED, and that I might have a higher chance of getting into CMC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's some info about me: I'm an international student (from Mexico), I am LGBTQ+ (so I'm definitely looking for a liberal environment, and possibly a school with a GSA), and I am very interested in studying abroad. I also love to party lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you, and good luck to all other prospective applicants!",

This is anecdotal and I don\u2019t know a lot of people from CMC, but the one CMC person I had a deep conversation with about their experience at CMC was from Mexico. She said she and her friend group (who are also Latina) don\u2019t feel like they fit in and are thinking of transferring. \n\nYou may want another perspective from someone at each of the schools with a similar background - people at the 5Cs are generally really friendly so you could find ppl online and reach out with a question.",

            "comment": "If you are interested in PPE then CMC is the school to go to over Pomona. The PPE major at CMC is robust and competitive. Only 20-ish per class are allowed to major in PPE at CMC and there is an application process. \n\nRegarding your identities, I can't speak on the international experience but as for being LGBTQ+ pretty much everyone at CMC is socially liberal. I'm gay, been out since I came to CMC, and never ran into any problems. CMC also has a club called SAGA (Sexuality &amp; Gender Alliance). I'd say that Pomona definitely has the biggest LGBTQ population of students though if that's of interest to you. \n\nIf you like to party then CMC is very strongly your best bet (on a typical non-COVID year CMC has 2 parties every week). Back when we had regular parties, you could always find Pomona kids at CMC parties but as a CMCer I have pretty much never gone to Pomona to party.",

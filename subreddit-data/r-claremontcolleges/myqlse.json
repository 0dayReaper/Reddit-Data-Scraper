    "postText": "Hey y'all!\n\nI've been incredibly lucky to have been both accepted to CMC and UCB as an international student and with the May 1st deadline coming up, I really don't know what to do. The more research I seem to do, the more I'm unsure. I love CMC's tight-knit vibe, being able to connect with professors so easily, guaranteed housing, and the small class sizes; but I'm also really drawn to Berkeley's nobel-prize-winning professors and the active student body (and tbh Berkeleys got CLOUT which could be really good for employment). Can y'all know what yous think? I realize the answers will be biased but I'd really appreciate the student perspective :D\n\nThanks a ton\n\nEdit: I probs should've mentioned my area of interest is Economics, business, and maybe policy!",

            "comment": "A couple things to know about Berkeley-\n\nHousing is not guaranteed, even for first year students. Bay Area rent sucks.\n\nStudents at Berkeley get ONE CHANCE to apply into the business major within Haas. They take about 300 students and it\u2019s fiercely competitive. \n\nThe Nobel prize winning professors are probably not going to be teaching your classes. Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe upper division work. And your class sizes will be large for the first two years (like 300-500 people large). \n\nThat being said, if you are planning to go back to your home country, Berkeley will have better brand recognition. Just be prepared to fight for opportunities on that campus.",

            "comment": "Tuition and fees will be much higher at CMC.  If you have to take out loans, then price is a factor.  If not (wealthy or on aid) then maybe price is not as important.  But for middle class people who do not qualify for much financial aid, the price difference adds up over four years.  So it depends on what you and parents can afford. \n\nCMC is a great school with good networking.  It is fairly conservative.  So depending on your politics that might be a factor. They have a great speaker program where they get top political and business people in for students to meet. \n\nBerkeley is a world class top university.  However as an undergrad, class size is large. If you have a personality that can break through and not get lost in a crowd, it\u2019s fine.  But if you want a smaller setting, CMC has the edge. \n\nAt CMC you can also interact with students from the other colleges.  Claremont has a cute downtown but it is suburban.  Yes, you can go into LA, but it\u2019s a bit of a hassle.  Berkeley is more cosmopolitan and it\u2019s easy to take BART over to SF. The Bay Area right now is expensive and hard to find housing. Not sure if housing in dorms is guaranteed or not.  \n\nAt a big UC, you do get the chance to take classes from top professors, but the class size can be big, and you may be interacting more with the TA.   At CMC, you would get to know your actual professor. Both school will have opportunities to be in clubs.  \n\nIn terms of jobs and clout, I think CMC has great networking and good career planning office. It might not be as known as Berkeley everywhere, but it is well respected.  You might check to see what their job placement numbers say about what their grads do after graduating.  This might matter depending on where you want to go after graduation. \n\nBtw, I  not a current student, but I went to UCB and my husband teaches at Pomona College.  Both schools are great choices and will not only have good professors but you will be with other really smart kids. \n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either. Congratulations on getting in, especially this year which was tough. I know it can be hard to make a decision.  Once you make it, embrace it.",

            "comment": "As an international student (senior) myself at CMC and my best friend at Berkeley Haas, I think you should choose Berkeley ONLY for employment and / or brand-name wise. CMC has much less on-campus recruiting than Berkeley, and most firms at the 5C sponsoring OPT/H1B are tech companies (mostly at Harvey Mudd, so you have to compete with those genius). Berkeley Haas has *specific* school recruiters (not just recruiters from a group of Southern California schools like UCLA, USC, and the 5C) from banks and consulting firms (think MBB) sponsoring international students (this year there are only \\~15-20 firms total).For other factors such as professors, social life, etc. I think CMC offers a much better experience than Berkeley.",

Berkeley has good global reputation.\n\nAt CMC you can take classes from every college (I've taken some at Pomona and plan to take some at Mudd). Career services are spectacular. \n\nCMC has lots of partying, but you can find info on how to partake or avoid on other Reddits.\n\nAlso, CMC has a top top Econ program. I know people who turned down Stanford, MIT, and IVY's to come to CMC.\n\nOne thing is for sure. Wherever you go, you will do great. Make sure you don't pile on too much debt wherever you go. You don't want to spend college years thinking about how much of a hole you are digging yourself. Whatever school gives you better aid is how I would decide.",

Career services are spectacular.\n\nBerkeley has better career services. It literally has 12 career fairs just in the Fall. And companies that SPONSOR international students see Berkeley as a single target and group CMC, Pomona, USC, UCLA as one target. Only Stanford and Berkeley can you getting OCR from quant finance &amp; private equity firms.\n\n3.   CMC has a top top Econ program. I know people who turned down Stanford, MIT, and IVY's to come to CMC.\n\nAnd how many people turn down CMC for Ivies, Stanford, MIT? Hmmm maybe admission yield rate gives you some insights.",

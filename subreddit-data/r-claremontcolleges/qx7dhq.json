    "postText": "Hi all! I\u2019m an international applying as freshman this year and I really like the Claremont Colleges, especially Scripps. However, I will be needing financial aid (a substantial amount of it) and I\u2019m hoping to get some glimpse into the minimum contribution level Scripps requires for an application to be considered, as well as the available scholarships the college offers. I could only find brief mentioning of scholarships ranging from 15k to 28k on the college\u2019s website and not much beyond that. Any sharing from alumni or internationals with similar situation would be a tremendous help. Thanks!",

Scripps offered me grants, scholarships, work-study pay, federal loans and private 0% interest loans from a special financial aid fund. I still had a manageable expected family contribution, but Scripps was one of the better financial aid packages I received. Your experience may vary as an international applicant though.",

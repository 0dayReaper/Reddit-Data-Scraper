    "postText": "Hi, Im a rising senior very interested in CMC, but I dont want to commit to the level of doing ED. Not that I think ill get in easily with ed... but yeah just in case.\nBut Im also kind of scares about applying RD bc Im not the most stat-stacked student out there. \n\nWould this be a good place to ask stats of CMC students/admits that got in w RD? Im very curious to see what type of ppl they admit :')\n\nCourseload, ranking, GPA SAT/ACT, ECs.. etc",

However, it will pull all mentions of Claremont McKenna: be it a rejection, waitlist, or acceptance. Just from a cursory glance, here are a few posters that got in RD.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/tlwshm/politically_involved_public_school_hispanic_kid/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/tu75e7/ny_kid_with_average_ecs_gets_extremely_lucky/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/ttf82h/black_boy_snatches_wig_figuratively_ofc/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/moauhp/unrecruited_soccer_player_applies_to_t20s_with_no/\n\nAnother option (albeit dated) is from College Confidential.

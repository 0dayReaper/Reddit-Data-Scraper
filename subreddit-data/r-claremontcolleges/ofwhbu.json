My high school didn\u2019t have formals or homecoming dances and prom was something I\u2019ve always looked forward too. Do the 5Cs have any formal dances that would be similar to the prom experience?",

The Christmas Party, Monte Carlo, and Wedding Party at CMC are all formal. Unsure how open to 5cs any are but probably open or at least doable if you buy a ticket or have someone who can bring you as a guest. No clue if this is will the case now with covid and it's been a couple years so could've changed. There are definitely others that I'm not knowledgeable about at the other 5cs.",

There are also a couple other party\u2019s where we dress up that I think I\u2019m forgetting",

    "postText": "The ED deadline is coming up and I am getting super stressed deciding on which Claremont college to apply to/which one would be my \"perfect fit\", but I'm wondering if I'm just overthinking it too much. \n\nIn the end, your college is really just where you live and what degree is on your diploma correct?\n\nI mean you can take classes, join clubs, and pretty much do everything at the other campuses right? So like worse comes to worse it's possible I can make friends on the other campuses if I rly dont vibe with my school? \n\nOR are the Claremont Colleges way overstating how connected they are, and most students tend stick to their campuses esp in terms of social scene.",

            "comment": "They're absolutely connected, but I would also advise that the idea of \"the specific college you attend is basically meaningless\" is an exaggeration. The colleges do absolutely have unique cultures, academic structures, even activities, and depending on which one you attend, you may find that things you want to engage in on other campuses are more or less available. Similarly with social scene, the 5C clubs/parties/etc are often available to all, but just by virtue of your day-to-day, orientation, first-year classes, core courses, the college and the types of people who attend absolutely make the biggest impact. \n\nAre there exceptions? Yeah, and there are the kinds of people who say \"I'm a Scrippsie but I basically live at Pomona\" or \"I go to Pitzer but I spend all my time at Harvey Mudd.\" You can usually do that if you want (less so now that the housing exchange is gone...) But those people would probably agree that they might have been happier in retrospect if they had actually been able to attend the college they identify more this. So as someone considering a potential ED commitment, the decision actually does matter outside of just which one is your \"most likely acceptance\" and you should spend some time with it!",

I find that there\u2019s been multiple opportunities to interact with students at the other campuses especially as a science major, since the keck science department is a mix of cmc, scripps, and pitzer students that all take the same classes together. so no, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re overstating and I believe most other students have the same experience as me and would agree :) overall you can\u2019t really go wrong with choosing a college! love it here",

I really think that has more to do with your preference than anything else.\n\nI will say, like another person said, some classes and majors are more restricted. If you're a huge computer science fan, for example, it'll be hard for you to take Harvey Mudd CS classes if you aren't a Harvey Mudd student ( because they're so popular). \n\nOverall, I do think that the culture of each school is different. Where you live isn't just a small part of your experience -- it's a big deal! Especially since most students live in dorms all 4 years, you do want to get along with your fellow students. I would take advantage of all of the virtual events happening around the 5Cs for prospective students to try to get a better understanding of each school's \"vibe.\"",

Besides the obvious (like they're rly good in gov, IR, social sciences-aka what I want to study), how would you describe their culture/vibe? Is there a wide range of people at CMC or does almost everyone fit into the super go-getter, leader, extroverted, work hard play hard stereotype/box I've been hearing about?\n\nI'd apply early to Pomona cuz I feel like they have the widest range of people, but I already pretty much got \"rejected\" during the athletic pre-read... something about me falling outside their academic profile even though I've taken (imo) plenty of APs and never gotten a B lmao, but whatever its their loss. Anyways sorry for oversharing but I passed CMC's academic evaluation so now I'm thinking more about them. Or Pitzer because they really align with my interests as well.",

If you want to go the recruited athlete route, CMC will be a better option since CMS has better facility and CMC pretty much carries the team. The stereotype is quite true since except for Pomona all other schools each has a specific industry focus (Mudd = tech &amp; engineering, CMC = business &amp; government, Pitzer = NGO &amp; fellowship, not sure about Scripps but I think writing &amp; arts).",

Frankly I'm not really a rankings person I think I'd succeed most at the school that's the best fit for me, so could you describe the social vibes/stereotypes of each school?

While in reality CMC is almost 40% students of color and 20% first gen, the stereotype is of trust-fund babies.\n\nPomona stereotypes aren't as easy to pin down. Definitely snobby and love being higher ranked than the other 5Cs lol. Pitzer students are stereotypically very liberal (probably the most liberal 5C) but also are typically white + come from wealthy families.",

That's why Econ and CS-related (Math, Data, Stats) classes are always packed.

Idk why but I have this preconceived notion that every single person at CMC is gonna be  packing their resumes while Pomona/pitzer people are gonna be just chillin. Is it more so that if you're an econ/cs major at either pomona or cmc you'll be doing the same type of networking/interning thing all the time? whereas if I wanted to major in international relations/environmental analysis (so not quite as pre-professional) there's lower pressure for that type of thing at both cmc and pomona? just asking this bc I rly love how many resources cmc offers, but im afraid (as an ir/ea major) I'll be way more stressed there? is this an unnecessary concern",

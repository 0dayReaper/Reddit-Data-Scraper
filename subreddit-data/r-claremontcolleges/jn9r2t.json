    "postText": "So im British and im studying communications in the US next year. Pitzer is one of the options im looking at and i really like it academically. However as i will be studying in the US i also want somewhat of a party experience. Whilst Pitzer doesnt really provide this i know that Claremont Mckenna does. I was just wondering its likely i would end up going to Claremont Mckenna parties even though i studied at Pitzer?",

If you want to join an exclusive party, which I haven't heard of any from my CMC friends, the key is you must know someone. The 5Cs don't have any fraternity and / or sorority, but beware that CMC parties usually involve a lot of alcohol. \n\nPersonal Opinion: ranking of cool parties: Mudd &gt; Pitzer &gt;= CMC &gt;= Scripps &gt; Pomona.",

                    "comment": "To add to this, Pitzer also has its own party scene, its just not as wild as CMC may be. CMC offers the typical, movie-type college party experience whereas Pitzer parties are usually smaller due to the space of the campus. If you want to go to Pitzer for academics but also want a good party experience, you can easily find friends at the 5Cs who will let you in to parties across the campuses.\n\nimo Since parties are easy to get into regardless of what college you're from, you should go with the college you actually want to major from. Policies and majors are a lot different across the colleges and you can't really change that process unless you transfer or major out of Pitzer/CMC",

(Scripps threw some as official events by our student's association, but we had a very determined events chair at the time.)\n\nPublicly advertised parties are generally open to all 5Cs (probably all 7Cs). Private parties are just based on who you know. If you make an effort to meet CMCers, you'll probably be invited to parties at CMC.",

You can get into pretty much any party and the social life of the schools is very integrated, on any given night you'll probably going out with a group of people from all the schools. I'm at Pitzer and can vouch for the party scene, I've met a lot of great kids from the UK through it and they've all had a great time. I can put you into contact with some of you want, just PM.",

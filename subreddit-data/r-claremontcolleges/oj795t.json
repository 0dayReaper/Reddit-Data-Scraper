    "postText": "I\u2019m a rising senior in high school and I\u2019ve started my college spreadsheet/search process, my mom was a CMC alum and she recommended that I look at CMC cause I\u2019m interested in political science and public policy and CMC is obviously pretty good with those. The problem is the chances of me getting in are slim, so I don\u2019t want to shoot myself in the foot by not having something. \n\nOn to my question, CMC recommends having three years of a foreign language, Texas requires high school students to have two. My dilemma is that my Spanish education has been lacking at best, the classes are literally a joke. If I just have two Spanish credits will that torpedo my admissions chance? Taking a third year of Spanish would actually hurt my gpa but it\u2019s not too late for me to sign up to take a third year of Spanish \n\nSorry that this was kind of rambly but as y\u2019all know the college search process is filled with anxiety and doubt\u2026",

            "comment": "Are you sure it would hurt your GPA? the best solution would be to take it while avoiding a GPA hit since it's recommended. Plus, the Spanish language is a finite set of information, I think it's definitely doable for you if you're concerned about it being too difficult. Not to mention it'll always be super useful in CA and TX! However, if the GPA consideration has to do with honors/AP and that's why you're torn there could be an argument for both sides.  You'd have to go up to the 4th semester of a language at CMC as a requirement anyways so doing more now could free you up a semester later.",

Honestly, since there are compelling reasons for both sides, I think you should probably do whatever makes the most sense for you as an individual and with your interests rather than as an applicant",

However, if you'll take a .02 drop in total GPA from the class, then it's absolutely worth it. Specific differences in GPA are really not important in admissions. CMC is really good at taking a holistic look at applicants. So, I would say that it is probably worth it to take the class.\n\n  \nSource: I saw my application file",

    "postText": "Been missing Pitzer tonight, thought it might be fun to do a casual questions thread! Spent three amazing years in Claremont and it breaks my heart that a lot of you haven't gotten to experience on campus life yet. Really, it's night and day from Zoom University. Questions don't have to be just about Pitzer, I've taken classes at all the colleges and feel like I've met a good cross section of student body. Ask away!",

                    "comment": "The social life in Claremont is - if you're willing to put yourself out there - top-notch. I can't stress enough that if you make the effort, you'll find great people to hang out with. I usually make music during my free time, which has helped me get to know loads of great people. The music room at Pitzer got renovated recently, and it's super nice (same with the Harvey Mudd one). \n\nWednesday-Saturday night you can find a good party. If you want a huge rager you're better off heading to USC for the weekend, but I've always had good luck in Claremont. Off-campus/Mead parties are probably the best. Gnarliest day of the year is always Pirate Party - do not miss Pirate Party under any circumstances.",

It's especially hard to imagine having any trouble with a CMC degree. I'm an East Coaster as well and am happy with my decision to go west for school. At the absolute very least, you'd be surprised how big of a difference the weather makes, haha.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor my own privacy I've chosen to make a throwaway for this. I'm going to be an incoming freshman at CMC next year. I'm really social and definitely looking forward to having fun. However, as of relatively recently, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. One of the big challenges that something like bipolar 2 poses is that sleep becomes an absolute nightmare; if you get anything that strays below mediocre sleep then your mood goes completely to shit and you're recovering for days. I was really looking forward to spending time in North Quad, but now I'm getting nervous. I really want to spend time there, but I'm worried that living full time in North Quad could potentially be dangerous for me. I'm considering filing for a medical accommodation for a single dorm, but I'm worried that there's a bunch of social life I'm going to miss out on. North Quad looks really fun!! I have to file my accommodation by May 1st so the deadline is fast approaching.\n\nSo: How much is social life based on which quad you live in, and how hard would it be for me to have fun @ North Quad if I'm not actually living there?",

            "comment": "Hey, the quad does not really make a significant difference in social life at cmc. It\u2019s true that a lot of parties are thrown in north quad, but they are very accessible to everyone in CMC, as well as 5C. Pregames happen everywhere in three quads, and if you make friends in north quad, they will host you a lot in their rooms. Recently, there has also been an increase in parties thrown in mid quad near Claremont hall. \n\nGiven your medical condition, I would highly recommend living in mid quad or south quad. North quad often becomes a very noisy place during Tuesday, Thursday, and weekend nights. You will also have a roommate and people from three more rooms connected to your room through a shared bathroom. Chances are they will get very loud too. \n\nSouth quad is a mostly substance free area with the quietest population. But, since all rooms are doubles, you will have a roommate. Many student athletes live in south quad, too, so if your roommate is one, she or he will have a different sleeping schedule due to morning practices. \n\nMy highest recommendation given your situation is mid quad where single rooms are available. Philips and Beckett are near north quad and drunken 24/7 green beach, and they also have lounges that often host parties. Berger, Claremont, and Benson (Berger closer to green beach though) are connected together and sufficiently far away from north quad, but sometimes parties are thrown in their center lounge or right outside of Claremont Hall. Crown Hall is very good and new, but there are very few singles, usually given to upperclassmen, RAs, and RTAs. Marks Hall may be the best option for you because it is at the most southern part of mid quad and sufficiently far away from noisy places, with many singles. \n\nSo, if I were you, I would request a third floor single room in Marks, Benson, or Crown Hall. I lived in Crown 3rd floor in my freshman year, and being in southern mid quad did not have any impact on my social life, as well as my access to north quad parties. It is only 3-5 min walk from north quad and quiet enough that I can sleep soundly at night. Being in mid quad also helped me have a broad, diversified network of friends from every quad of CMC, as well as some in Pomona. \n\nMost of all, you are an incoming freshman, so you will have four chances to experience different quads and dorms. You might be concerned that not living in north quad will hinder your chance of social life in CMC, but that\u2019s not true at all. What matters is your willingness to interact with others and make meaningful relationships.  Moreover, party life is only one segment of life at CMC. There are so many other things that go on in campus, and you will be able to participate in any activity, regardless of your dormitory/quad. There is no secret society open to north quad residents. \n\nLastly, sleeping, if not properly managed, can ruin both your academic and social life. I had some physical issues that hampered my sleeping schedule during my second semester of frosh year. My sleep issues led to more sleep during days, skipping classes (professors hate that), doing assignments in nights (no parties), and eventually lack of social life and destroyed GPA. So, I really recommend that you live in an environment that does not affect your sleeping. \n\nHope you make a right decision that will lead to a happier and healthier life at CMC, although I don\u2019t even know if it will open up this fall.",

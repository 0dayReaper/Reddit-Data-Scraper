    "postText": "i'm a freshman at the 5cs this year and i heard that cmc and hmc throw great ragers. so far though, most of the parties have been weird dorm parties or tons of people out on north quad standing in groups and smoking. no good music, no dancing, and people either drink for the aesthetic or get smashed when there is no party to be found.\n\nis it because of the pandemic, or should i be expecting this to be the party scene for the next four years? i'm someone who really invests in the \"work hard, play hard\" attitude and i am pretty extroverted, so going out on friday nights and seeing parties start at 8 pm and end at 11 pm, and mostly consist of people talking and no music, is really not how i want my college experience to be.",

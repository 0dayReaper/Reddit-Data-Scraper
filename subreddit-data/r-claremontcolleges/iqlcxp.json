            "comment": "I got into Pomona as a transfer in political science so I\u2019m not super familiar with its STEM clout, but I know that Pomona has insanely high placements for med school. A committee guides you though the med school admissions process from the day you step on campus and I would check whether the other 5Cs have one too. Otherwise, you might be able to attend Pitzer and get counseled by a Pomona committee but I\u2019m really not sure. Anywho, I\u2019ve heard complaints that the culture at Pomona is getting too preprofessional, but I can guarantee that people obsess over grades less in Claremont than they do in Westwood or Berkeley. And for campus culture breakdowns I\u2019d consult someone else, to my knowledge Claremont McKenna has a heavy Econ/poli sci emphasis and both it and Pomona have super strong connections in consulting (McKinsey and Bain recruit exclusively out of Pomona, CMC, Berkeley and Stanford in the west coast) and I\u2019m sure that preprofessional vibe permeates through the whole campus. Sorry this is long winded, but you\u2019ll get an actually amazing education at any Claremont school. For admissions purposes, expect it to be as competitive (and for most schools it\u2019s MORE competitive) as it is for freshmen slots (no TAG or TAP here) but it\u2019s still possible to get in. Really good letters of rec pull more weight in liberal arts admissions than they do anywhere else (outside of PhD lol) and get a good SAT score. Also, I would still do the honors program/TAP if you go to a California community college that has one, it carries a 90% acceptance rate to UCLA and that\u2019s a pretty insane school to have as a safety. If you\u2019re a realistic candidate for any claremont, you should have no problem getting into UCSD as a second safety too. The most important thing here is to check out whether you can access Pomona\u2019s med school admissions advisory boards as a student at Pitzer or Scripps. The 5Cs are supposed to share resources like this (you can enroll in other study abroad programs and take classes at other 5Cs if you attend any one of them), so I\u2019d email around. Med school placements and jobs at McKinsey are THE reason to go to an elite private school on the west coast, so if you can tap into the med side as a Scripps/Pitzer student, you\u2019ll be golden.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am planning to apply to 5 colleges in Claremont, and need help with deciding which one should I submit on ED2. \n\nI am an International Student, aiming to request full ride to any of those colleges. \nMy GPA is around 4,5 on 5.0 scale. Have a lot of extracurriculars, awards. \n\nOf course Pomona is my favorite one, but I know it is super competitive, so I am considering applying to another college on ED2 to increase my chances of getting in. \n\nAny advice would be highly appreciated. \n\nThank you so much for your attention!",

            "comment": "Honestly, it varies based on the school if you're aiming for a full ride. Pomona doesn't do academic scholarships so the financial aid is need based only. They do meet 100 percent of demonstrated need though so it shouldn't be too major of an issue. I only applied ED1 to Pomona though, I'm not sure what the other colleges' policies are for financial aid. I can't really give advice about those. I know that certain other colleges in the consortium do not meet 100% demonstrated need like Pomona does (Pitzer, for example). \n\n  \nWhat I will say is that if Pomona is your #1 choice, it's a good idea to apply there. If you don't try, you'll spend the next four years wondering if you should have!!\n\nfeel free to DM me if u have any more questions!",

So I wouldn\u2019t not apply to Pitzer for need based reasons as they will meet your need I\u2019m pretty sure, but probably not merit. \n\nAnyway I think you should apply to Pomona if you like it the best as all the Claremont\u2019s are pretty hard to get into, and you don\u2019t want to be spending your time in Claremont wishing you were a pomona student and being upset you never tried.",

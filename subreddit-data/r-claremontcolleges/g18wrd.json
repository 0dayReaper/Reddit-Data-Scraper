    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am highly considering CMC for ED, however I don\u2019t like what I see regarding the culture at CMC especially on this sub. If you saw the post \u201cwhy pitzer shouldn\u2019t exist\u201d I was really disappointed that a a CMC kid would choose to write something so hateful. Additionally, it seems to be the most \u201cbro-y\u201d of all the Claremont colleges which I don\u2019t like.\n\nCould someone confirm/dismiss my thoughts on CMC\u2019s culture? Thanks.",

I have a friend that graduated from CMC that does not fit that description at all.\n\nConversely, you'll find a handful of people who fit the \"CMC\" stereotypes at the other 4Cs too.\n\nIf there are things that you love about CMC that are unique to that school, don't let that dissuade you too much. \n\nIf you're just interested in the Consortium in general, then possibly consider the other colleges but keep CMC on your list too.",

            "comment": "That post was hilarious. That\u2019s not an opinion shared by like... anyone... ever. \n\nI\u2019m not a CMC student, but I was also wary of CMC\u2019s culture before attending the 5Cs. Fortunately, the stereotype is just that: a stereotype. I have made really good friends with CMC students and generally find them to be exactly like other 5C students, just possibly a bit more career-minded. CMC\u2019s academic programs skew more practical than the other 5Cs, IMO, so there is a bit of a different mindset going on.\n\nOf course there are a lot of guys that are pretty \u2018fratty\u2019, but it\u2019s really not the majority. It is possible to be an entirely socially active CMC student and not party, most of my friends do exactly this. If you\u2019re not into that \u2018scene\u2019, though,  the noise on Thursday-Saturday nights might be a consideration. Lots of pregaming in dorms which can get pretty loud...\n\nI think it\u2019s also fair to say that CMC is the most athletic of the 5Cs, and there\u2019s a noticeable presence of student athletes. Again, a totally neutral thing, but teams often eat together in the dining hall and you remember \u201coh yeah, we DO have sports\u201d.  This also means that the rec sports have good participation, and that the facilities for this kind of stuff are amazing.\n\nBut all in all, CMC students are smart, confident, and driven, even though a few can be privileged assholes (the case at any school, tbh). The campus may give off \u2018bro\u2019 energy, but there\u2019s certainly a place for you if that doesn\u2019t describe you. \n\nAlso, final note: CMC is a bit more politically right-leaning than the other campuses, if this is something that is relevant for you. Not by a huge amount, just a bit, and this definitely does not apply to every student there.",

I've heard that cmc is more of a conservative school, although the vibe I got is that it was still fairly liberal but just not as blazingly left as most liberal arts schools. Can you give me a rundown on your views on the real nature of how conservative cmc is?\n\nTo clarify: I am super liberal but also believe that political diversity on campus is one of the most important educational assets that colleges ignore. Not sure if that means anything here, but thought it'd be important to note",

And, you won\u2019t be out of place as someone who has very liberal views. \n\nI also think conservative tinges are reflected more in college policy than anything else. For example, the board of trustees is quite Republican judging from their [political contributions](https://tsl.news/claremont-trustees-have-donated-more-than-7-million-to-political-causes-since-2015-with-cmc-leading-the-way/) . As far as the students go, these schools are full of smart people, so most everyone is open-minded to an extent. In my experience, I can have some really insightful political discourse with someone even if we disagree.",

The [Pitzer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/claremontcolleges/comments/frw1sg/unpopular_opinion_pitzer_shouldnt_exist_today/) person was a very extreme example, and you won't find people saying stuff like that when they have to put their name on it, but they were channeling an attitude held by some portion of the CMC student body.",

It\u2019s definitely there but the school is diverse enough to ignore it if you desire. There is a crowd for everyone! \n \nRegarding the Pitzer post person, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it. Sounded like a psychotic episode of someone who probably shouldn\u2019t have had access to the internet. There is of course friendly banter across the 5Cs and comments are made on a two-way street but I haven\u2019t met anyone yet in my four years that would share the same sentiments of that poster. Being a CMC student entails being diverse, so many of us find ourselves making friends across the 5Cs. There have been issues within the cmc community of students being cutthroat with each other but this is pretty limited to a certain subset of toxic students. \n\nYou should definitely visit before you make a decision. It makes a huge difference to be physically present in a space that you can envision yourself at for four years. Best of luck with your decision!",

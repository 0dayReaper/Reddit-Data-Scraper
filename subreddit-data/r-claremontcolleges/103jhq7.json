But if I don't get in I will definitely consider that. \n\nAnd do the advisors help you get into the program? I know they'll make sure I complete the required classes. If so, that's nice to know. Thanks.",

It's not impossible at all if you go in knowing what you want to major in, a lot of people struggle b/c they start the classes for the track later. Just map out which classes you have to take when and you should be fine.",

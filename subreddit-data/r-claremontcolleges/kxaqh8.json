    "postText": "im a pomona first year but with how my mental health declined after months of zoom and the stress of being home, ive been considering taking the semester off to work/intern. im interested in the IR major which requires a semester abroad. im worried that if i do another online semester plus the semester abroad i would only spend 5 out of 8 semester in claremont (and study abroad is something ive always wanted to do). im conflicted about what i should do so does anyone have feedback/advice? im currently signed up for kuehlwein for macroeconomics and tinker salas for latin america since independence, and im concerned that if i take the semester off i could miss out on getting into their classes later on but im not sure exactly how hard/easy class selection is in future years...",

            "comment": "Hi there! Current IR major, junior, who missed out on study abroad sadly bc of the pandemic :( I definitely understand that virtual semesters can be draining and exhausting, especially with being home all day. I don\u2019t know about what kind of work you\u2019re looking into, but chances are it\u2019ll probably be virtual/remote as well, so that\u2019s something to consider. Therefore, if it\u2019s the school material/learning that is causing you distress, then taking a leave might be wise. Getting into classes will always be difficult, especially for the sophomore and freshman class years bc of everyone who has taken a leave is making those class years bigger in some cases. I think the second most important thing to consider (after your health) is what your plans after graduation are \u2014 if you want to go to grad school or go straight to work or apply for fellowships or such. would you be okay with graduating in december and figuring out from there? it\u2019s a lot to think about ofc, but hope this helps! for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ll be doing another online semester bc I\u2019d rather be done sooner rather than later and bc I surprisingly find it easier to do well in my classes online :)",

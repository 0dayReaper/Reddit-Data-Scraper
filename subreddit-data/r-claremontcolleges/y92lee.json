    "postText": "Hi, i am a prospective transfer student coming from a 4 year university. i'm a freshman right now and want to transfer for my sophomore year. (also- does the transfer acceptance rate differ based on if you apply as a soph or junior?)\n\nany advice on what to do in my application or my interview? i am getting involved with clubs and extracurriculars at my current school and am on track to do the english requirement and get around a 4.0 hopefully.\n\nalso i am hoping to do some sort of product design in the future, so which college would have the best resources for this? are there any resources for virtual reality development?",

It does have an official song - [\"Thy Many Gifts\"](http://www.scrippscollege.edu/about/glance/traditions).\n\nRegarding Thy Many Gifts:\n\n- Could I recite the lyrics from memory? No.\n\n- Have I sung it before? Yes.\n\n- Could I recognize it if I heard it? Yes.\n\n- Can older generations of alumnae recite it from memory? Probably!\n\nMaybe people more involved w/ athletics would know - does CMS athletics have a fight song?",

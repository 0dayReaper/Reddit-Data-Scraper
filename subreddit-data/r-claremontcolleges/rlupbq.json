    "postText": "Hey, I'm a senior writing his essay for CMC. I was going to address how some of my time spent doing extracurriculars has allowed me to become more outspoken about the racial inequities. I was wondering if that would be a non-strategic move considering how conservative CMC is, and if I should just focus on other aspects of my extracurriculars.",

            "comment": "There are two levels on which you should be thinking about this: admissions and fit.\n\nOn the admissions level, I'd say you should go for it if you think that'll be your best essay. CMC isn't *that* conservative that they'll be offended by it, unless you express some truly radical views. And remember that even at colleges like CMC with a clear personality, the admissions officers are looking to craft a diverse class, so I suspect it may actually help you to go against the school's stereotype, since you'll stand out from the pool more than if you're just another legacy finance bro. Just throw in a line about liking to challenge yourself by engaging with others with diverse viewpoints and you'll seem CMCish enough.\n\nOn the fit level, you only have to worry about that if you're applying ED, or if you're concerned CMC might be such a poor fit it's not worth the cost/effort to apply. Otherwise, that's a question best asked after you've been admitted, and best answered with an in-person visit.",

Our most recent Saturday party even required a donation to one of two black-centered charities in order to gain entry. \n\nSecond, if you think a school would penalize you for writing about racial inequality advocacy then that isn't a school you should want to attend in the first place.",

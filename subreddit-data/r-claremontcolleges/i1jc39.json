I've got a little over 50% in fellowships and 1 of them is departmental. I've got a total of $14k/sem towards tuition and fees, adjustable as per the number of units I enroll for. This amount is for 12 units/sem. (A friend of mine in another PhD program at CGU has got $12k in fellowships)  \nI applied way before the priority deadline but I think even if you do apply before the regular deadline you're considered for the fellowships. However, because they don't have an undergrad section they don't give you a full ride.",

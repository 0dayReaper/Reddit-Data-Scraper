    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI'm a student from the UK writing a paper about the application of Rational Choice Theory to explain collective protests. Unfortunately, this is a very niche topic and hardly any academic literature exists directly relating to my thesis. Even more niche is the fact that I'm focusing on collective protests in the Middle East. I've only found [one such paper online](https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cmc_theses/574/) that is exactly what I'm looking for (and I've spent WEEKS searching for literature) but unfortunately, I can't even access the paper! I can only read the abstract, but from what I have read it's exactly what I'm looking for. The paper is written by a Claremont alum and is subsequently only available to Claremont students. I've sent two emails requesting access to the paper, but both have been ignored. \n\nIn a final act of desperation, I am therefore wondering if any Claremont students would be kind enough to download this paper and send it to me so that I could read it myself? There's only a matter of days until I have to submit this assignment and it's one of the most difficult things I've had to write in college thus far. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you!!!!\n\nhttps://scholarship.claremont.edu/cmc_theses/574/",

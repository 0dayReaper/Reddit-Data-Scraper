    "postText": "Is it possible to compete for academic prizes at any of the other 5Cs? Like, can I compete for most of the English/Philosophy academic prizes at Pomona or Scripps?\n\nAlso, assuming that I get in, how many classes will I usually be able to take any of the other colleges each semester? I read somewhere that Pitzer only allows students to enroll for one cross-registration each semester, but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate and would really appreciate it if someone could maybe spread some more light on this.",

Certainly not on account of taking an off-campus major, although you should note that if you're trying to major in English and/or philosophy, you won't be able to officially do the major at Pomona or Scripps since Pitzer offers them both.",

    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m an incoming freshman coming into one of the Claremont colleges! I\u2019m deciding on what Meal Plan to choose, and the biggest factor that is bugging me are the Board Plus dollars. Being on financial aid, I\u2019m being very picky of what plan I choose. I\u2019ve looked extensively into the website, but there isn\u2019t that much info. \n\nSo, here are some questions: Are Board Plus dollars literal dollar stand-ins? What are some items you can purchase from the snack bars? Can they only be utilized at snack bars? What is the difference between Claremont Cash and Board Plus Dollars??\n\nPersonal one: I\u2019m a huge coffee fiend, I drink coffee every morning. Will I be able to get (or purchase) coffee every morning with Board Plus Dollars? Will I be able to get enough coffee per semester with $140 board plus dollars?",

            "comment": "Board Plus is generally known as \u201cflex\u201d, and it can only be used for food-related purchases (both at dining halls and snack places). It is exactly one-to-one with actual dollars, and there is no tax when paying with flex. Claremont Cash is money loaded onto your account by you. It\u2019s necessary for stuff like laundry, and it can be optionally used any place on campus that takes actual money (bookstore, library, etc.). You do pay tax when using Claremont Cash.\n\nA coffee every day might be hard on $140 (ensuring leftover flex for some snacks), but for getting a drink a couple times a week, it\u2019s fine. If you were looking to maximize coffee per dollar though, I think the Motley (Scripps campus) is your best bet. An americano is $1.35, and there\u2019s no tax if you pay with flex. Adding a fancy syrup is like $0.25, and topping up with milk is free, so you can get an approximation of a latte for $1.60.",

            "comment": "Claremont Cash is the money that you deposit into your account, so it can be used to purchase anything you want both on and off-campus. Unused Claremont Cash will roll over from one year to the next. Board Plus is already part of your dining plan and can be used only for food and beverage at on-campus vendors. You can use Board Plus to purchase additional meals if you run out of meal swipes before Sunday. Board Plus does not roll over from one semester to another.\n\nThe Motley Coffeehouse at Scripps is really good! You should be able to get enough coffee with $140 board plus dollars if you pick cheaper options. They charge a dollar extra if you ask for a to-go cup, but you can easily avoid this by bringing your own coffee mug. You can also fill your travel mug with coffee in a dining hall before you leave.",

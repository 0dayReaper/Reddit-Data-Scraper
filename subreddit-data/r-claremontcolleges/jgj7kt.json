However, I have great ECs and great essays being written as we speak! I just need some insight on how my GPA and lack of SATs score would affect my acceptance. I'd really appreciate your help!",

            "comment": "Not sure how the lack of SAT will affect admissions this year but please take my advice and complete the \u201coptional\u201d video supplement (if that\u2019s even a thing for ED). I did it and I\u2019m sure it helped me tremendously in the process. I didn\u2019t have great grades during my freshman year of high school (but did have a drastic upward trend) and had great ECs (ran a decently successful business that worked with some companies, created an app, played sports, etc.). I used the 2 minutes I had in my video to tie my extracurriculars to how I would contribute to the community at CMC and couldn\u2019t be prouder of it. Trust me: this advice goes a long way because it allows you to make a case for yourself, express your personality, and, most importantly, allows admissions officers to tie a face to your application. It helps them get to know who you are and how they\u2019d think you\u2019d fit in at CMC. After all, admissions officers aren\u2019t necessarily looking for students with the best grades or test scores but rather someone who will genuinely improve campus life and contribute to the community. Hope this helps :D",

CMC looks for go-getters, so putting yourself in a position where you can show that you're willing to work hard to get where you want to be will help you tremendously. And research, research, research! When writing your essays, doing your video supplement, and talking with admissions officers, you want to show that you really know the school, what they stand for, and can explain why you'd fit in well at the school and why it's your top choice. I believe in you, and you got this!",

I think that even if you could do it quicker than that you would be missing out on things and have a pretty restricted schedule, especially with a dual major. I know a handful who have done what I described above in 7 semesters.\n\nedit: and the ap credits would just be a bonus. mathematically it's doable if you just overload 4 semesters with 5 classes I guess, but obviously fitting in another 4 classes in 6 semesters (graduating in 3 years) would be a challenge and require two semesters overloading with 6 instead of the normal 4. that would require special approval from the registrar which may not be easy to get at cmc, you would need to convince them you have a good reason. can't speak for other colleges.",

You would either have to take summer courses or get credit for internships (which requires writing a 40-60 page paper). Taking into consideration a dual major, it would be even harder. Unless you have a wildly pressing need to be out in 3 years I would not advice setting it as a goal.",

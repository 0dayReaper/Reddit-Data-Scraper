(the rate is so high because the advising and infrastructure absolutely sucks.) i would advise asking about that when you find the person to talk to! \n\nsomething you can also do is just email the admissions people and ask them to put you in contact with someone. you might get a pretty biased answer from ppl who are specifically selected by admissions, but at least it\u2019s someone! \n\nbest of luck homie",

There was also one scenario i think like \u201cwhat would you do if you caught your friend cheating on a test\u201d or something along those lines",

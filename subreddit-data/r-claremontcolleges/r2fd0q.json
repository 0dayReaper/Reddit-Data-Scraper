    "postText": "I can't seem to get any classes in the fields I like and I don't have the major I want at my school (I have similar ones accessible however). Also, the chances I would have at internships and jobs in the exact fields I'm interested in would be better. I'd not only have the specific major as experience but I would have the best connections that had the same major. I'm a freshman and I'm wondering if anyone knows if it's: a) possible and b) worth it  to transfer between the Claremonts.",

            "comment": "Yes, it is possible. There are like 10 current Pitzer-to-CMC and 1 Pomona-to-CMC transfers at CMC. It looks like you go to CMC and I'm personally not aware of any CMC students transferring to a different 5C in recent years but I'm sure it is possible. \n\nI know of several CMCers who transferred out successfully to other colleges though. In the class of '23 I know of two who transferred to Vanderbilt, two who transferred to Wesleyan, and one at UGA. Additionally, in the class above me ('20) someone transferred to Brown and the class below me ('22) someone transferred to Cornell. \n\nIf you think you will have a better experience at a different college (major you want, classes you want, connections you want) then you should absolutely try to transfer. You only get one college experience, so don't settle when something better exists for you.",

            "comment": "Both are awesome but I think Catalina reigns supreme. Attracts more students with more diverse interests and personalities than backpacking imo but almost all my friends did one or the other. Can\u2019t go wrong with either. The backpacking part of Catalina doesn\u2019t have that much backpacking\u2026 it\u2019s not too much mileage and it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the backcountry, so if that\u2019s a factor for you maybe backpacking is better. The backpacking group you get assigned to will depend on your level of experience but no matter what the days don\u2019t have that much mileage to cover. The catalina trips also have varying difficulty in terms of mileage and kayaking currents. \n\nSorry this is kind of everywhere but if you have a more specific question you want answered to help decide pls feel free to ask. I did Catalina for my orientation and then also led it the next year and had friends lead backpacking so I have a sense of both trips but am definitely skewed in terms of amount of information and preference towards Catalina.",

Sounds like you lean towards outdoorsy but the LA focused ones are very cool as well. Honestly all of the trips help you make friends (everyone will be friendly and eager to make friends) and if the outdoor scene is for you, both are a good way to get introductions to the outdoor club. \n\nI would say def bring your own stuff down if you have it. If you don\u2019t have something it\u2019s truly nbd bc the gear closet has so much stuff and pz will make sure you\u2019re prepared and have everything you need for orientation. I liked having my own stuff that I knew fit me well/ you\u2019ll probs be going on trips throughout the school year, esp for breaks and it\u2019s nice to have your own stuff for that (if you want to ofc). But you can always rent from the gear closet is need be. They have a lot of gear!!",

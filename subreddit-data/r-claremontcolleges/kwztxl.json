    "postText": "\n\nHello! I have a question about the admissions video as is probably obvious from the title. I know it\u2019s kind of late into the process to make the video, but I\u2019m still under the deadline!\n\nAnyway, I would like to shoot the video now since I don\u2019t usually have much free time to do so, but it IS 12am and very dark? Does it look bad to shoot the video in the dark? I\u2019m definitely not in pajamas or messy-looking, and I have good lighting, but you would still notice that it\u2019s very much nighttime. Would that be a problem? \n\nAlso, during online interviews, I have acted fairly cheerful and casual, as is my personality. However, in an interview, I could always get a good reading of the interviewer\u2019s energy and bounce off it\u2014something I cannot do with a video. Should I act more formal and even-spoken?",

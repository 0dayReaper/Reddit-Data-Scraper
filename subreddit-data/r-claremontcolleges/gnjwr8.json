I looked online and I found UPenn however I don\u2019t like the school scene out campus from the virtual tour it\u2019s a great school by all means. However my friend told me about the Claremont colleges and I asking any current student what is the best accounting school to go to out of the 5 and how was your experience? This would be extremely helpful I don\u2019t necessarily care if it is highly ranked I know Econ at cmc is amazing but I generally would like to know from the students who attend the five colleges thank you in advance!!",

            "comment": "Claremont McKenna is the only school that offers an accounting major, which is Economics-Accounting. If you want to be a CPA, I would not go to CMC. I was in a combined Masters of Accounting/B.S. in Accounting program and transferred to CMC as a junior. I enjoyed Accounting before coming to CMC. I ended up dropping my Economics-Accounting major due to unhappiness and difficulty in the program here and have since switched to Government.\n\nDefinitely come to CMC if you like the school, but if you are looking for the best Accounting program I would look elsewhere. As the previous poster said, no one cares what school you went to for Accounting. I went to an unranked small private before coming to CMC and all of my friends were still able to get Big 4 jobs after graduating.",

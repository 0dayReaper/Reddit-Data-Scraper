    "postText": "Hey guys so I\u2019m currently a senior planning to apply ED2 to Pitzer and I was wondering what is something Pitzer would really like to hear in their supplemental. I was originally going to apply ED1 but my private counselors friend who supposedly \u201cgets kids into the schools they want\u201d told me my supplemental was not ready and didn\u2019t make sense. The question I answered went something along the lines of \u201cwhat is one cause you would like to work on at Pitzer or when you graduate\u201d or something like that and I wrote about how the schools in low income communities don\u2019t really give enough support to high schoolers during their college process and that I would start a fundraiser or program to help those who want to go to college and give them the resources that there school doesn\u2019t give them. She told me that I should focus on something like climate change and was telling me about how the polar bears are dying and that I should focus on that because Pitzer is all for that. I told her that would be hard to do because I don\u2019t really understand what I would write about since I\u2019m not really too focused on that. She told me to start researching and that I need to come up with something. She then told me that I live in this little bubble and I need to step out of it and start looking at the real world because I told her I\u2019m not into politics. I honestly really want to go to Pitzer but I feel like I\u2019m not too sure what to write down for the supplementals. If there\u2019s anyone currently in Pitzer willing to give me advice I would really appreciate it. I feel like I\u2019m stuck and don\u2019t have too much time to write a crazy good supplemental.",

Take mine.  College admission counselors read a million supplementals.  Im sure they read thousands a year that are about climate change.  You sound like you have a life experience that inspires you to do something about it.  That demonstrates clarity of vision, dedication, and a personal connection.   Those are all things that pitzer SHOULD value.  I graduated in 2008 and don't remember what I wrote mine about, but most likely it would have been about how fulfilling I found volunteering after I got arrested as a part of my plea.  I maintain public service aas a part of my life to this day, though not as a career.",

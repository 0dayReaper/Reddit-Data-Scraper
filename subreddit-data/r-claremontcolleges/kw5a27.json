If you\u2019re talking about what you call students that go there (like \u201cmudders\u201d for HMC students) then that\u2019s debatable and I\u2019m not sure there is one that\u2019s agreed upon.",

They aren\u2019t the nicest at times but this is the lore I\u2019ve been told. \n\nMudders are the dwarves because the women look like the men. (This is bullshit because some of the most beautiful women I know are Mudders). \n\nScrippies are the elves because they like to stay behind their walls and gain knowledge.\n\nPomonans are the men because they are greedy and always wanting more to try to compensate for their own insecurity. \n\nCMCers are the orcs because they are trying to crush the men (Pomona) because of their own deep desire to control the world. \n\nThere\u2019s one that uses Harry Potter houses too and a Scooby Doo analogy.",

    "postText": "Seriously, CMC has 11 research institutes with frequent events ranging from econ, government, science (CMC and Pomona strength) to social justice, creative writing, and environment (Pitzer and Scripps strength).\n\nPomona and CMC have a wide range of major and the majority of events are taking place at the either two. Pomona and CMC look like comprehensive universities now. Money did solve everything.\n\nDo you think that Pitzer and Scripps are liabilities to the other 3Cs?",

Pomona and CMC are outstanding schools that offer an outstanding education in many different fields of study. The same can be said about Pitzer in Scripps. Each of the 5c\u2019s offer courses that don\u2019t exist at the others schools, allowing all students to benefit from a greater selection of classes and professors. Additionally, there are numerous clubs and student groups that are composed of a mix of 5c students and resources. When 5 separate schools operate in a way that allows students from other schools to benefit off each other, doesn\u2019t everyone win? What are you trying to get at here?",

            "comment": "\"Liabilities\" \ud83d\ude02 Individual schools do not drag down the ranking of others in the consortium, they only strengthen each other.\n\nAll of the 5Cs lean into different areas, and the value is that you can augment your own chosen curriculum from any of the other programs.\n\nScripps leans really heavily into writing and fine art fields and had a well-regarded Art Conservation program IIRC. A lot of pre-meds tend to choose Scripps as well.\n\nPitzer has a strong philosophy program and also an excellent math department in its own right from what I've heard.\n\nI think the best thing about the consortium besides sharing resources is that they all have their own students they attract and admission criteria, so the population is more diverse through the consortium structure than at a single institution.",

                    "comment": "Yeah but like I wrote, CMC and Pomona have soooooooo many resources that even overlap the strength of the other Cs, even Harvey Mudd itself.\n\nFor example: \n\n1. Pitzer focuses on changing the world through the lens of the environment, philosophy, social activism, and science. CMC owns the Roberts Environmental Center, Salvatori Center for the Study on Individual Freedom, Mgrublian Center for Human Rights, and now is preparing an independent science department. Pomona has 10 research labs for psychology and the Draper Center for Community Partnerships. And for the Philosophy program at Pitzer: most classes are from Pomona College (29 PO vs 15 PZ). You wrote that Pitzer has strength at the Math department. But that's for lower-level courses. Pitzer's Math lacks Upper-level courses compared to CMC and Pomona. And upper-level math courses at CMC and Pomona are jointly offered. Furthermore, many events are written \"jointly offered\" by either HMC, Pomona, or CMC. Furthermore on helping people: CMC has tons of clubs just like Pitzer such as the In-Lend Fund.\n\n2. Scripps focuses on Arts and Humanitites: Pomona College has its own Music, Theater, and Dance departments and recently announces a $15 Million Gift for New Art Museum. CMC has its own Department of Literature, the Gould Center for Humanistic Studies and even a Graduate Scholarship for master's or Ph.D. in the arts, humanities, or social sciences of up to $34,000. \n\n3. Harvey Mudd has superb CS, Math, Engineering departments. Pomona has ones, too, for CS and Math (2/3 most popular majors at Pomona, just close behind Econ). CMC is pouring money like crazy to expand the Mathematical Sciences Department. The only thing Pomona and CMC don't have is the Engineering Department.\n\nThose resources above have the majority of CMC and Pomona students participated (I checked on their websites). And Pomona and CMC's traditional strengths are econ, leadership, entrepreneur, and political science. According to an extensive Linkedin search, compared to Pitzer and Scripps, TONS and TONS of graduates from Pomona and CMC majoring in these areas became leaders and are very successful in their fields. \n\nMoney solves many things. But this is just my opinion according to my online search as an outsider. So, what Pitzer and Scripps resources/ unique things are providing to the 5Cs right now? I THINK this is a real problem and the 5Cs need to work together in the future.",

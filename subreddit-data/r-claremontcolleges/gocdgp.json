            "comment": "Many of cmc courses are in social science, and its students are also avid social scientists. To make sure that cmc students can take necessary courses to fulfill their GE/major requirements, cmc admin designates popular courses like those in econ/gov/IR as CM only. If there are spaces left, few off-campus students can enroll too. You can also submit PERM and send an email explaining your interests to professor, but if there are CMC students on the waiting list, they will be selected first. Other 5C colleges do this too for their popular courses. Pomona restricts off-campus students for its natural science/humanities courses, and Mudd for its CS and engineering courses. If you want to take courses outside your campus, you should look at the historical enrollment/demand (~3 years) of those courses in course registration portal. If there were many spots left, for example in Fall 2017, 2018, and 2019, and not many PERMs submitted, you can safely assume that there are spots for off-campus majors in the upcoming semester.",

I want to take studio arts at scripps at one point, so it would be sad if they are restricted to me. You might want to check the portal\u2019s course registration page for restrictions on off-campus students.",

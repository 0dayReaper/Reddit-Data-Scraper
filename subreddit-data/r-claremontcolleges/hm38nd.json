    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m an athlete who has been recruited by both CMC and Pomona. I\u2019m interested in majoring in either History or Politics, but I\u2019m also considering the EEP major at CMC. Here are a few questions I have:\n\u2022 Which school has stronger History and Government departments?\n\u2022 I\u2019m worried about the stereotypical \u201cfrat culture\u201d at CMC. How pronounced is this culture?\n\u2022 I\u2019ve heard that the athletic facilities are in poor shape at Pomona, but I can\u2019t visit due to COVID. Are the facilities really a problem?\n\u2022 Is Pomona significantly more prestigious than CMC? For students at the consortium: have you ever known someone to choose CMC over Pomona?\nAnswers to any of these questions would be helpful. Thank you!",

            "comment": "The schools' cultures are pretty different. Pomona is a more typical liberal arts school (but with strong STEM departments), while CMC is more focused on Econ, Gov, and History. Note that Pomona's \"gov\" department is called Politics. I absolutely loved all of the Pomona Politics courses that I took - the professors are incredible, and Carnegie (the building Politics is housed in) is beautiful. I never took a CMC history or gov class so I can't comment on that. \n\nIt's true that CMC is stereotyped as the most fratty school, which I agree with, but as a Pomona student I'm biased, of course. There pretty much aren't fraternities, which helps, but if you want to find a random party with alcohol laying around and beer pong your best shot is at CMC. Pomona's administration, on the other hand, is pretty strict about partying, so Pomona parties typically get shut down pretty quickly unless you're careful. \n\nI don't know anyone who chose CMC over Pomona simply because most Pomona students wouldn't really consider going to CMC (due to lack of fit personality-wise, not due to CMC's having a lack of prestige!). If you want to do Gov/Politics, I think both CMC and Pomona have enough prestige if you're worried about that.",

            "comment": "I'm an incoming freshman at CMC so, although I don't have a ton of hands on experience with all of these questions, I can definitely answer a few:\n\nIn terms of choosing between CMC and Pomona, there are definitely people that go with cmc. One of the reasons you'll have difficulty finding people who turned down one or the other is that the colleges admissions offices communicate with each other to decide who will be the best fit for which school. They don't really want to compete, so a lot of the time people will get into one or the other but not both, even if they're qualified. However, when people do get into both, I haven't seen a real pull from one to the other. It seems that people generally want to go to the school that has the better programs in whatever they're interested in.\n\nThe prestige question is a little tricky. Claremont McKenna has a hefty amount of prestige, but more so on the west coast. I'm from a big east coast city, so much of the time people won't know what CMC is. On the same train however, in my area people also won't know what Pomona is most of the time. It's extremely regional. Pomona is generally better known nationwide, but I can't speak to the specificity of how much more. However, Claremont McKenna has an *incredible* reputation among finance and businesses recruiters. The CMC silicon valley internship program is absolutely nuts. If you're really unsatisfied with the prestige levels and want to brag to your friends and family, you can always do the Oxford program at CMC which will send you to Oxford University for a year. \n\nSomething important to note about the above answer is that, although there are definitely some assholes who want to brag about CMC's prestige until the day they die, a lot of the kids chose CMC because they cared less so about prestige and more so because they loved the school. Generally, I think choosing a college based on subjectively viewed prestige is an awful way to make such an important decision. I turned down UPenn for CMC because I felt that I would be both happier at Claremont McKenna and receive a more implementable education (also upenn sucks, but that's a different conversation). People can get sucked into the world of prestige and forget about what's really important: going to a school where you can receive the best education possible and be happy while doing so. I advise you to remember that when choosing a school, regardless if your final decision is in the consortium or not\n\nHope this helps.",

            "comment": "I agree with what the other commenter said! I think both schools are just as prestigious and though CMC is known for their social sciences, I'd argue that both schools have departments just as good. SO it comes down to your personality and where you think you'd fit in more socially. Of course, there is some overlap between the 5c's and ultimately you can't go wrong either way",

            "comment": "Can't speak for the academics just because I haven't taken classes in History/Politics, I do know that I have a handful of friends who have done polysci at Pomona and have had great things to say about it.  I think either way you'll get a good experience academically.\n\nIn terms of the culture of people at each school, CMC definitely has more of the frat-vibe to it.  I feel like people from CMC might be a bit more social, whereas at Pomona you've got a mix of people who are super outgoing/socially active and others who aren't totally that same vibe.  \n\nBoth have similar reputations, at least in my experience.\n\nI'm also an athlete, I can say that it sort of depends on your sport.  CMC's athletic complex for indoor sports (basketball, volleyball) is basically brand new, but Pomona is in the process of building a new one I believe.  I'm not totally sure when that's supposed to be done.  Both pools are comparable, as are both soccer fields, and I think that both baseball/softball fields are comparable.  Not 100% sure on track or cross country differences.\n\nI will say that in regards to social groups, depending on your sport/team, most sports that I've seen are very tight-knit groups and spend a lot of time together, and are usually pretty close with another couple of sports from their schools (either PP or CMS).",

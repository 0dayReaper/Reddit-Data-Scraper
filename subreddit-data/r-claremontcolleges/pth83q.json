    "postText": "Hey there, I'm currently a community college student who's finally got his ass in gear and wants to go to college. My friends mom goes to Pitzer and so I took a tour and absolutely loved the campus and am totally onboard with your student ideals. I wanted to ask about the quality of the philosophy program there. Only problem is that my gpa is kinda shit, and I'm not sure how hard it is to get in as a transfer. Also, if any of y'all are New Resource program applicants what did y'all do to get in? Thanks a bunch.",

Did you go to Pitzer/5Cs specifically for their philosophy? The reason I ask is because finding anything about phil undergrads is coming up short. Frankly I'm just assuming it's good because it's an LAC.",

It's a pretty strong department, as is CMCs (applied there too and taken philosophy classes so ik a little more about it than Pitzer specifically). If you poke around their websites, there might be a little more info than on Pitzers, not really sure? If there's any type of information specifically that you're looking for, I might be able to get it (at least for Pomona, since I work w the department)",

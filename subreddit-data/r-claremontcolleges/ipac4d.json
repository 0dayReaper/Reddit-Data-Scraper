    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019m a transfer student who took a gap year because of Pomona\u2019s online plans, but I want to experience Claremont and get familiar with the town before I enroll! Is there any point in moving back? Are there any reading groups with outdoor meetings? Do people sip coffee at cafes\u2019 outdoor seating areas? My other option is to live at home (tho I am keen on moving out) or visit Seattle + NY + Austin (I have family in all 3). Only 3 months in each of those cities sounds pretty lonely, and without at least some social infrastructure it seems really hard to meet people. Fortunately the Pomona FB page is alive and well, and if that\u2019s at all reflective of the Claremont area right now (I know it\u2019s not exactly 1 for 1), I wouldn\u2019t be averse to finding some roommates for a year of remote work in Claremont!",

Can't speak to how it is during lockdown, but I felt pretty acquainted with it within a year during normal times. \n\nYou can ask around on /r/Claremont to see what's currently happening in-town.\n\nIt's possible there's more to experience around the Inland Empire, but I don't think there's much you'd miss out on.\n\nWhy not take advantage of your gap year to experience somewhere else, rather than the place you plan to live for the following couple years?",

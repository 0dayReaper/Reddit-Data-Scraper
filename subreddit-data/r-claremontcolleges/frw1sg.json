    "postText": "Why? Because CMC has literally everything that makes Pitzer students proud of - the core values. Literally everything!\n\nTl,dr: Pitzer is a shame of the 5Cs. With a modest endowment, the college can't do more cool stuff that CMC is doing right now. Furthermore, Pitzer's reputations are weed and throwaway classes, and Pitzer alumni having the worst income mobility with high college sticker price and low income after graduation (they mostly just do jobs not require a college degree), while CMC grads are truly leaders making positive social impacts in literally any sectors/fields. Money solves nearly everything, so Pitzer should not exist and be merged with CMC.\n\nSocial Responsibility: CMC has the **Kravis Lab for Social Impact, Mgrublian Center for Human Rights, Center for Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship,** **The Berger Institute,** **KRAVIS LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE, and tons of community service clubs** that transform CMC students into leaders that REALLY change the world and MAKE A REAL SOCIAL IMPACT.\n\nInterdisciplinary Learning: CMC also has many Interdisciplinary courses.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability: CMC also has **Roberts Environmental Center,** an Environmental Analysis major, and a ton of clubs related to Environmental Sustainability.\n\nIntercultural Understanding: CMC not only has a **more diverse student body** but also has **many more international students** representing **more countries** than Pitzer. CMC also has **more study abroad program** and the **percentage of CMC students studying abroad** is **the same** as Pitzer (which mean more students - more perspective). Let's not say with **a much more robust financial aid package** and **a need-blind admission,** the socioeconomic status at CMC is more diverse than Pitzer's.\n\n([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/pitzer-college](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/pitzer-college)) (Pitzer)([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/claremont-mckenna-college](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/claremont-mckenna-college)) (CMC)\n\nAlso these:\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/03/15/pitzer-president-rejects-college-council-vote-suspend-israel-study-abroad](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/03/15/pitzer-president-rejects-college-council-vote-suspend-israel-study-abroad)\n\n[https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/students-at-private-university-denied-yacht-club-because-yacht-clubs-are-offensive](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/students-at-private-university-denied-yacht-club-because-yacht-clubs-are-offensive)\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/15/pitzer-students-debate-free-speech-student-safety-and-cultural-appropriation](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/15/pitzer-students-debate-free-speech-student-safety-and-cultural-appropriation)\n\nStudent Engagement: The ASCMC functions the same as Pitzer Student Senate: literally CMC students participate in every CMC decision-making process.\n\n[http://www.associatedstudentsofclaremontmckennacollege.org/college-comittees](http://www.associatedstudentsofclaremontmckennacollege.org/college-comittees)\n\nLet's not say CMC has a better ranking in every ranking, lower acceptance rate, much much better alumni base, and career services, and many more opportunities.",

However, since graduation, I completed my Fulbright Year and founded and co-lead a non profit that has raised $27k in the past 5 days. These are  accomplishments that I attribute to my time at Pitzer.\n\nOh, and i also got to swim for PPSD, a relatively inclusive, fast, good-looking, and smart team!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis comment was not meant to bash CMC! I appreciate CMC and have many wonderful experiences with the college, but i guess every 5C has some bad apples.",

These are accomplishments that I attribute to my time at Pitzer.\n\nYou can totally go to a cheaper school without debt in order to get a Fulbright scholarship. You don't even need college to lead a non-profit. Many high school students have already doing that and they are now in Stanford, UPenn, Harvard, and CMC.\n\n&gt; Oh, and i also got to swim for PPSD, a relatively inclusive, fast, good-looking, and smart team!\n\nThis isn't even relate to the question at all.\n\n&gt;  i guess every 5C has some bad apples.\nBut Pitzer has the most and CMC, Pomona, Mudd, and Scripps have much fewer.",

Most importantly, they are good people.\n\nIt seems that there are a couple accounts under similar handles attempting to deface the school. You aren\u2019t fooling anyone.

As far as income, I am graduating this year with a 6 figure salary, the grads who don\u2019t make money choose more noble paths. You\u2019ll find many outstanding Pitzer grads in non-profit and educational sectors. Just a different focus, Pitzer and Pomona are better comparisons imo. But you shouldn\u2019t go to pitzer if you don\u2019t like the environment, it is very different. \n\nEdit: capitalization",

I went through Professor Conger\u2019s sequence at cmc, I also did a lot of stuff at pitzer with cmc students. Without either of those I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today, the schools have a symbiotic relationship. Perhaps you should open your mind and try to understand the alternative classes and values, you should research Peter F. Drucker\u2019s (his graduate school of management is one of the 7cs) thoughts on undergraduate vs graduate education and then get back to me :)",

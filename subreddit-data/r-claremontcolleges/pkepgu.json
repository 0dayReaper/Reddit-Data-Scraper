            "comment": "Not sure where you got your info, but not \"all the students\" smoke pot or drink to the point of being hungover at any of the colleges. The Claremont Colleges are not known as party schools.\n\nYou'll find that the majority of students participate in those types of recreational activities moderately or not at all. Each of the Claremont Colleges might have a handful of students that use heavily, but it's not the norm.",

If youre an alumni or a current students there could we maybe have a private meeting (online) or message sonce theres so much i want to know about and im thinking of taking one as an ED. So if i could connect to someone there that would be awsome. And thank you for your reply\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

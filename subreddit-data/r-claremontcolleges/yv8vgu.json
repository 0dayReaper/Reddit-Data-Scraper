    "postText": "I am a senior living in CA, and right now I\u2019m just looking for options. I cant get into UCs and CSUs unless I get into community first because I don\u2019t have foreign language for the A-G requirement as I am not originally from california or even USA. Im also considering community but due to reasons I won\u2019t share I want to go to a 4 year if I can. Just curious which school would help me become a concept artist (game or animation industry but I have a strong preference to shows/film) thanks!",

With Pitzer we have a gallery and students do a show at the end of the semester. There are opportunities like working at local art galleries. You\u2019d really have to compare them",

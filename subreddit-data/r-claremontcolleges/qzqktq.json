As someone who will probably have to work while I attend college, is it possible to keep up with the workload, my job, and still have time to do college stuff?",

Although it can be difficult sometimes, my jobs are pretty light in terms of work, so I can usually do some homework during that time. Also, the core curriculum is being changed for your class year (CO '26), so you'll actually have a bit of a lighter workload compared to previous years.",

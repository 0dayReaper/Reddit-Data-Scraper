[[I\u2019m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he\u2019s a major fucking hottie. I\u2019m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I\u2019m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Pitzer in Claremont, California where I\u2019m a leech in the pool (I\u2019m seventeen). I\u2019m a goth (in case you couldn\u2019t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside the pitzer pool. It was snowin",

    "postText": "Hi all, rising senior here.\nI\u2019ve been really interested in Harvey Mudd recently as I\u2019m looking for a challenging STEM school with a small student body, but was wondering if the reported extent of the coursework\u2014specifically, resulting in a lack of sleep\u2014was true, or if it\u2019s just an exaggeration to emphasize the rigor. I really love a good academic project and so wouldn\u2019t mind difficult coursework, however I am unwilling to consistently sacrifice a healthy sleep schedule for my education, and frankly would be a little shocked that others are. Any advice?\nIf it\u2019s relevant, I intend to major in CS.",

People even say that if you prioritize your mental health, your grades will flunk so a bunch of people just disregard their mental health to maintain their grades. \n\nNot saying that there isn\u2019t a social life on campus, since you\u2019re literally in the heart of California, but just keep in mind that you are going to a VERY competitive, rigorous school, and your grades are expected to be a priority.",

            "comment": "Mudd student here! Echoing what other people have said in regards to social life and time management. I also wanted to add that the rigor depends a lot on your major as well. For example, if you\u2019re a CS major, then the work gets a lot lighter once you finish Core. On the other hand, if you\u2019re an Engineering major, the workload seems to ramp up/stay constant from what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nHowever, I think that most of the rigor stems from Mudders taking on too much. There are so many interesting classes/extracurriculars here, and it\u2019s difficult to say that we already have a lot on our table. Managing your time well also means managing the amount of things you are doing well.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, you can have a healthy sleep schedule so long as you prioritize it. I also think that sleep is important, and during my first year, I usually got about 8+ hours of sleep everyday with some occasional 6-7s when deadlines/exams were coming up or overlapping. Nowadays, I can get more than 8 hours of sleep every day being a CS + 2nd major.\n\nAlso, not to throw shade, but I don\u2019t think students from the other 5Cs can accurately assess what Mudd\u2019s rigor is like (and the same goes for me with their experiences). Most 5C students I\u2019ve met, think I\u2019m dying with work, and when I tell them it\u2019s not horrendous, they think I must be some genius. No, the real answer is that even when Mudd is getting overwhelming, there are so many support systems to help you. The students and professors want you to succeed and so long as you actively seek out help (office hours, Academic Excellence (AE), grutoring, the Writing Center, etc.) I can assure you that you will do amazing here. *Most students who fail courses or do poorly are ones that don\u2019t take advantage of these support networks.",

If you can manage your time I promise you will be just fine! Also CS majors tend to have the most freedom in terms of credits and amount of classes they have to take.",

That being said, Harvey Mudd is so hard to get into that it can\u2019t hurt to apply and see what your options are after the application cycle",

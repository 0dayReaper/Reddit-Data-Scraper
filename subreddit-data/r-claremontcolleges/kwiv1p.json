I didn\u2019t get the gpa I was expecting to get and I don\u2019t know what my gpa should be to be considered \u201cgood\u201d\n\nI dread doing second semester of Zoom. It\u2019s coming up in a couple of weeks and I feel unprepared. Everyone else around me seems to be fine and I feel like I am the only one who is left behind and I can\u2019t connect my struggles with others. \n\nI was wondering if any other 5Cers feels the same way to connect",

            "comment": "I'm a Pomona senior, I can definitely relate to this... \n\nFor the GPA question - In my experience, a GPA between 3.5 to 4.0 at Pomona is considered pretty stellar in most students' eyes. A's are not widely issued - You may have to be in the top of the class to get one (in normal circumstances, at least), but A-'s and B+'s are pretty great and a B is still pretty good. Some 5Cs classes are ranked, while others have weird grading systems (i.e. no intermediate grades like +/-). Don't worry if you haven't gotten all straight A's unless you know for a fact that your grades would make or break law/med school apps. In CS, Econ, and some other fields, internships and connections might easily be more important than having an A rather than a B+.\n\nZoom has been a challenge, I really sympathize with current freshmen who haven't been able to experience in-person classes. What I can say is that becoming proficient in these video conference apps now will be immeasurably useful at your job one day. Pro tip: Keep the video on for possibly better grades (?) (According to my theory, at least). Professors really appreciate seeing the camera on during class.\n\nOne last thing - Don't be afraid to try to negotiate with professors about workloads and deadlines and such. I'm sure they would be accomodating.",

It really broke me because I spent a lot of time in that class but I guess that\u2019s college. \n\nI wanted to go to med school but I heard that I needed a 3.8+ which really stresses me out. \n\nAlso I am a bit confused on how gpa is calculated. Is A+ and A calculated differently?\n\nThank you so much for your help. I see that you are senior and hope that you can return to campus for this last semester!!",

No, an A+ is the same as a straight A ---- If a professor is really amazingly impressed with you, they'll give you an A+ to distinguish you from people that got a straight A. For example, if you scored 98-100 on all midterms/final and had a good relationship with the professor.",

    "postText": "Looking at the claremont colleges, it seems like with the campuses being so close to each other it's basically one giant school? I was really looking forward to the small school vibe that's found at other LACs and wanted to know if you still develop that bond with your classmates from your school even though there are four other campuses next door. Thank you!",

You can definitely stay within your college for social groups if you'd like, and class sizes are very small. (Largest non-lecture class I had was 20 students.) But the interconnectedness of the college's allows you to make bonds with people from other walks of life, who have different interests, and you get the \"bigger college\" vibe that way if you seek it out. It definitely doesn't feel like a big school, and it feels like everybody knows everybody else.",

But you have all of the other schools there as resources if you need them, even if it's just for their cafeterias. \n\nThere are some resources that are shared among campuses, such as the medical office, the main library, some athletic facilities.",

            "comment": "I'm gonna be really really honest with you: NO. Regardless of whatever praise the admission team told you, deep down, students at each school ONLY talk about, feel proud of, or consider themselves graduates of their respective schools, AND just see other schools as resources they're trying to exploit as much as possible, ESPECIALLY students from CMC. If you look closely, you will see that most competitive clubs such as Pomona Consulting and Sagehen Capital Management have mostly Pomona students, and most rewarding resources such as Centre for Innovation and Entrepreneurship and Robert Day Scholars ONLY recruit 1 student outside of CMC. Those clubs and resources only invite Pomona and CMC alumni to their events, which further proves my point. In a broader scale, Pomona-CMC-Mudd students consider themselves superior to Scripps and Pitzer students: in Pomona-CMC-Mudd classes, regardless of the fact that I'm on top of the classes, I've always feel lonely and Pomona-CMC-Mudd peers ONLY look at their respective schoolmates for help. This is current a world of hypocrisy and keyword-filtering, where most people only care about how much money they can earn. Don't fall for that!",

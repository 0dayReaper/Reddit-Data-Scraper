    "postText": "So I was looking at Harvey Mudd, and while they obviously have a class physics program, their majors are limited to STEM-y stuff. However, since it is possible to complete a off campus major, I was curious if any of the other Claremont colleges had an education program, and if so could I study there while attending Harvey Mudd.",

If you are interested in being an educator in Physics, do not look over English as a discipline. It\u2019s one of the most essential majors for education degree route- you will need both English linguistic knowledge and Physics knowledge for teaching. Both Scripps and Pitzer have advisors that know well about teaching route and  you should contact them and ask about education focused English classes that they offer",

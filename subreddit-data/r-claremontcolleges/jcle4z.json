    "postText": "How are Scripps &amp; Pitzer viewed by employers? I know Pomona, CMC, and HMC are ranked a little higher but personally I feel super drawn to the Scripps and Pitzer communities and can really see myself growing and thriving and being the happiest. Of course, \"fit\" and \"vibe\" are huge factors but their reputations and ability to help me post-grad must be considered as well. So I'm just wondering if any current or past students can speak on how a Pitzer or Scripps degree has helped them in terms of career opportunities and resources. Especially if my goals are to get involved with some really cool global non-profits or just gain super cool experiences in stuff related to global social justice issues, would I be disadvantaged coming from Pitzer or Scripps? \n\nBc I know for consulting, IB-ing, CS, etc. priority is probably given to the other three but if my interests do not lie in those areas would you say Pitzer or Scripps would be amazing choices?",

Regarding Pitzer students, they all get major-related internships, and most of them are fulfilling and align with the students' passion.\n\nProof: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HeG4m6KP0PoRigg8eaQsgVZkc4poMtO4/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HeG4m6KP0PoRigg8eaQsgVZkc4poMtO4/view?usp=sharing)\n\nBUT, there was much less finance-related interest at Pitzer and Scripps (notice 'was'). Pitzer students mostly prefer to work in Business Administration or roles dealing with people (no idea about Scripps). In fact, the Econ major at Pitzer and Scripps educates economists, while the Econ major at CMC educates finance &amp; accounting people, and Pomona is the combination of the two. CS is only available at Mudd and Pomona, and employers know about all these things.\n\nHOWEVER, there are more opportunities for students interested in finance at CMC: advanced classes, clubs, research institutes, internal networking, etc. but if you're active, you have no lost at all.",

Most of the major consulting firms/banks only accept applications from target schools, and that tends to exclude Scripps/Pitzer. But that is very industry-specific, and it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what you want to do anyway. If you\u2019re focusing on non-profit and social justice, Scripps and Pitzer have strong programs, good reputations in the field, and arguably a stronger supporting alumni network in those fields.",

Most campus hiring attention is on MBAs (the assumption is undergrads will leave in a few years for an MBA anyway), so undergrad recruiting is seen as a minor extension of the MBA recruiting focus. West coast target schools are those with strong MBA programs - UCLA, USC, Berkeley, Stanford. Undergrad recruiting at the 5Cs was an abnormality, largely driven by alumni in my experience.",

That means the focus is on filters to weed out people quickly so there's more time to focus on the most likely candidates. School is one of those first filters (hence the entire \"target school\" application approach the firms/banks use), then a GPA cutoff. Major and internship/work experience are then the differentiators. Rarely does individual class selection or performance even get attention.\n\nHiring doesn't have a \"false negative\" problem with letting a great candidate mistakenly get weeded out due to the filters. The focus is on avoiding false positives efficiently and getting a small number of high potential recruits that can be shaped after hiring.",

Other than transferring, the highest probability answer is to start planning for a top tier MBA program.\n\nNeither consulting nor IB are related to non-profit or social justice issues though. If those are the areas you are most interested in, I would focus on those internships and related experiences. Maybe reach out to your school\u2019s development office for a campus job - development experience is a good way in to the non-profit world since it is always an in demand and highly transferable skill set in that industry (it always helps to be a profit center rather than a cost center).",

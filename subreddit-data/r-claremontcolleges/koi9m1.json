I may be wrong though since I go to Pomona and hence know the most about my own school. Anything you would find would most likely be very, very loosely related in the economics, sociology, anthropology or art departments to name a few.",

This will essentially make a marketing major for you. If you don\u2019t want to torture yourself, you can just minor media studies, because the quantitive part of marketing is the most important and grinding (data analysis), and you might just better focus more on that.",

It encompasses a huge range of disciplines is probably one of the most flexible majors offered at the 5Cs.  \n\n\nI switched to the Media Studies major in the second half of my sophomore year and really enjoyed it. It suited my interest in video games as media and art. I built my course roster around that interest, but other Digital / Electronics focused majors explored completely different paths. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the classes that counted toward my major:\n\n* Intro to Computer Science *(looks like this no longer counts though and Media Studies has its own programming classes - \"*\"*Hello World!*\" *Intro Python Prog\"*,  *\"Intro to Computational Media\", and \"Intermediate Computational Media\")*\n* Digital Imaging *(Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator)*\n* Electronic Music Studio *(hard to get into at the time, might still be)*\n* Lots of film and TV analysis courses\n* Created art assets for a game project w/ HMC CS majors *(got class credit)*\n* Internship at a video game company *(got class credit for summer internship)*\n* Thesis topic around video games  \n\n\n\\^ There weren't any classes around video game media analysis during my enrollment, but I see some have been added since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould I make the exact same choices again? Not entirely. I found programming really engaging and fulfilling once I got over my concern I wouldn't do well at it. Had I been exposed to CS sooner *(took my first class late in my college career)*, I probably would have declared a CS major instead. But the Digital / Electronics side of Media Studies did end up being a great area of study for me overall, and I can see how my coursework influences a lot of day-to-day decisions I make in my current role *(mobile app developer)*. Had I chosen to go into games, I'm sure Media Studies would have been an even stronger choice.  \n\n\nI definitely agree w/ how people have recommended Media Studies for your Marketing academic interest. I'd recommend taking a wide range of Marketing-adjacent areas of study *(Media Studies, Psychology, Econ, Sociology, etc)* early on to see which departments are best set up to support studying what interests you. Find ways to wedge these into your GE requirements if you can.",

    "postText": "So there has been a spike in covid cases across the 5c\u2019s and each college has responded differently. But from Pitzer specifically I heard students were not being treated very well in regards to food/dining options and online classes. Is this true? Should I take this as a sign to not enroll at the 5c\u2019s? What\u2019s your take?",

            "comment": "My take is the Pitzer students seem pretty committed to trying to protect the vulnerable amongst them and are largely in support of masking, etc., which shows care for community. Social media shows numerous ways to get support for those in isolation, but I saw a couple of comments too that students were frustrated by admitted students on campus when they have restrictions. Not sure what colleges can do... if they cancel admitted events last minute when other schools don't, it is really hard to enroll a class.  I don't view this as \"only worried about profits\" I think it is just reality for every 5C.  No idea about online classes, but I don't know many schools that are doing a good job with it.\n\nI know people at an ivy that isn't providing isolation housing anymore for Covid+ students, telling suite mates to \"use masking\" to try to avoid getting covid from a roommate.  So... I think the 5Cs may be more cautious and strict with their handling of Covid, but the opposite approach would likely be much worse, at least for some students.  \n\nIn general I think open disagreement about something isn't a bad sign in a college, it is a sign that students are thinking and engaged and not afraid to speak up. I think at least a couple of the 5Cs have very strong student governments so they have power to work on issues if they need fixing.  JMO but this type of thing wouldn't factor in an enrollment decision.",

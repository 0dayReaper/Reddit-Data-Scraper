The worst they can say is no. \n\nYou could also just bring your car, park it outside school grounds somewhere, and just walk to it. Though be warned that it may get ticketed or towed.",

I'm not sure on the exact reasoning but I think it has to do with the limited amount of parking available on the campuses. First year students rarely feel the need to leave campus anyway. \n\nAs for why the golf team is allowed to bring cars, it is because their practice courses are outside of Claremont and must be driven to.",

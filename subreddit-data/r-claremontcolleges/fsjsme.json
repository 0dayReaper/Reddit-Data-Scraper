Do student athletes still have time for trips to all the SoCal hotspots on the weekends? How is the D3 experience? If anyone has any input I\u2019d love to hear!",

Balancing the school workload and practices is tough, but it depends on many other things as well (which school you attend, what major you are, which sport you play, etc.). I (as well as all of my teammates) have the utmost respect for anyone going to HMC AND doing a sport. For my particular sport, you have to invest about 3-4 hours a day in the spring whether it be for weight training or a practice. On the flip side, I invest maybe 6 hours per week during the fall semester and most of those hours are invested into the weekend for scrims and longer practices. \n2. You can definitely make time for it during the off-season, and occasionally during the season, but you better be prepared to organize your schedule well ahead of time because of schoolwork and practices. \n3. The D3 experience is what you make of it, honestly. Academics are definitely the priority at most of the colleges, and will accommodate you based on your academic schedule. You aren't \"technically\" required to be at practices, but try not to skip out on them. Same with games. \n\nIf you'd like more specifics, then just PM me!",

I've found that playing a sport in college has helped with time management (at least during the season) because it gets you into a solid routine everyday with class, practice, and work. Some semesters are tougher than others depending on classes as well as your commitment to your sport and other activities. Outside the season, I've found plenty of time on weekends to get off campus, however, during the season I've only been able to do that sort of thing on Sundays when we don't have practice. Overall, couldn't be happier with my decision to pursue athletics at the 5c's, a great way to learn lessons and skills that translate to the professional world.",

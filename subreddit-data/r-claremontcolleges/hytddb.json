    "postText": "Newly enrolled international student at CGU here!\n\nHi everyone! \n\nI'll be starting my program in Fall 2020 but its going to be online due to the pandemic. Since I'll be on-campus for Spring term and after that, I was looking for advice from all of you.\n\nAdvice regarding anything &amp; everything that is CGU and Claremont is welcome, especially housing because as an international student everything already seems expensive so any help with that will be appreciated!",

            "comment": "Welcome to CGU! I will say the first piece of advice I can give you is that as far as I have seen, CGU students are not super active on Reddit. Or at least, not in this subreddit. The better place to go to find CGU students may be Facebook. I am in DBOS, the division of behavioral and organizational sciences, and we have our own Facebook group that's pretty active. Other programs might also! You can also try finding people on LinkedIn who list themselves as students in your program (past or present) and DM them. They would have the best knowledge about specifics.\n\nI feel you on budget. You may have already looked and seen that there are two Grad Student housing options: \"Collegiate Apartments\" and Oasis.  Collegiate Apartments is essentially a glorified dorm--they even have freshmen from the 5Cs living there. Oasis is only a year old and much nicer, with amenities like a pool and hot tub (but I believe the price tag reflects that). I never lived at either, but have friends who lived in both so I can speak vaguely to either of them if you're interested. I found both of them to be too pricey for my budget so I lived farther from campus for cheaper.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the typical housing trajectory seemed to be: first year, either stay in student housing or find a place/roommate online before moving to town, and then second year and onwards, get a place with friends you'd met in the program. At least in DBOS, often houses are \"passed down\"--someone moves out of a room and hands their lease off to a friend. Not sure how the pandemic will impact that but I'm sure you'll form digital friendships. There are also tons of retired couples who rent out extra rooms, etc. in town, but that's also more word-of-mouth, so it might be worth asking your advisor or professors if they know people looking to rent.\n\nThe tricky thing would be transportation--if you're coming without a car, closer is obviously better, but Claremont is kind of pricey. The cheap housing is in Upland or Montclair or Pomona, but you'd need transport. There is a bus system with like two stops in Claremont, although neither of them is on campus (the bus routes go around campus, avoiding it entirely). Claremont also has a train stop on the commuter rail, and the station is about a half mile from campus. If you're willing to take the train to and from campus, that opens your possibilities a lot--you could live anywhere along the train route, and the farther east you go, the cheaper it tends to get. But it is a commuter train, which means trains come once an hour or less, and stop around 10pm on weeknights. With either the train or the bus I'd make sure to do some research about routes and schedules if you'll be depending on them.\n\nThere is also a CGU housing group on Facebook (private, but you basically just need to ask to be let in). People use it to advertise rooms and also advertise themselves as looking for a room: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/117746641662297](https://www.facebook.com/groups/117746641662297)\n\nThis website is for locals who want to rent out to students. It gets updated fairly regularly: [http://blogs.cuc.claremont.edu/realestate/](http://blogs.cuc.claremont.edu/realestate/)\n\nFinally, people often link this office although I've never used it. It seems to basically be a directory of local apartment options:  [https://services.claremont.edu/real-estate-and-housing/?fbclid=IwAR3dRPTg1ZPixvYnbpT7yjVnXJevbhke7C9gdR2ahI5wbYdlzbboRg1vpaY](https://services.claremont.edu/real-estate-and-housing/?fbclid=IwAR3dRPTg1ZPixvYnbpT7yjVnXJevbhke7C9gdR2ahI5wbYdlzbboRg1vpaY)\n\nBest of luck!

This is going to be super helpful!  \nSince I'm going to be an international student, I obviously won't have a car but I'm willing to walk around if its going to be like 15-20 mins (1-1.5 miles, I guess)  \nI've made a friend via facebook who's from my home country so we're looking forward to being roommates. \n\nI have already joined the Facebook group and have checked out the links you've mentioned, but it helps when people give their personal feedback. I'll keep coming back to your super helpful reply as and how we start making decisions about housing! Thanks once again :D",

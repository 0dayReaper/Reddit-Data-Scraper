            "comment": "im just gonna post my econ professor\u2019s (Pitzer) quote here: \u201cSome folks from McKinsey came out to Claremont and took me out\nto lunch a number of years ago. They basically asked me to be\non the look out for good students. They told me that in California, they\nonly recruit from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and the Claremont Colleges.\u201d\n\nEveryone who majors in math-heavy econ at the Claremont has a shot, but CMC puts more resources into econ and has significantly more econ student by proportion(CMC, Pomona, and Pitzer in order), so CMC has better chance for you getting in the industry. However, if you intentionally look for the chance to get into a prestigious firm, there are enough resources for you to do so at every college, even at the \u201cleast prestigious\u201d Pitzer, from that professor again, \u201cA former Pitzer student of mine left McKinsey recently, where\nhe was a partner, to a smaller startup. More recently I have\na former student just starting at Goldman Sachs, and another\nformer student at BlackRock. A couple recent alums are at\nAccenture. We used to send a lot of students to Deloitte.\nAnd in the tech field, I have former students at Google and Amazon\neventhough they were econ majors.\u201d\n\nBut if you are explicitly interested in econ, CMC will be infinitely a better choice for you.",

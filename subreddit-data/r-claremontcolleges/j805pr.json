    "postText": "Hello, I am a prospective applicant for Pitzer! I'm heavily considering a form of Early Decision, and I was curious about how majoring across schools work. At Pitzer, I would plan to study Critical Global Studies. However, if I were to decide to switch to International Relations, for example, which school would that be at (since multiple of the colleges offer International Relations but Pitzer does not)?",

            "comment": "According to the International Political Economy Major page on Pitzer's website, which I will link below, \"Students may not major in International Relations at CMC as this field is equivalent to International Political Economy.\" I am unaware of whether this would restrict International Relations for Pomona as well, but I would assume not since it isn't mentioned. At the very least you are not able to major at CMC for International Relations due to the fact that Pitzer offers International Political Economy as a major, which is equivalent. \n\nLink: \nhttp://catalog.pitzer.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=14&amp;ent_oid=587\nYou have to click the part of the webpage that says International Political Economy Major in order to see the quote I mentioned.",

But, I heard something bout him being one of the last guys to be able to major IR at CMC, so it\u2019s likely that the new IR major at pitzer is too similar to IR major at CMC and the admin is preventing new students from declaring one at CMC to make sure its major gets ppl. There has been a growing trend among 5C, especially CMC and Mudd, closing their majors and popular courses to off-campus students. For Mudd, it\u2019s CS, and for CMC, they are econ, finance, gov, and IR. That might be why Pitzer is trying to build new majors in those areas. Same thing is happening in Scripps too I heard.",

You should look at International Political Economy instead - exactly the same as CMC's IR: [http://catalog.pitzer.edu/preview\\_entity.php?catoid=14&amp;ent\\_oid=587&amp;returnto=1160](http://catalog.pitzer.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=14&amp;ent_oid=587&amp;returnto=1160)\n\nThis is a new major I think. Maybe this is the reason why you can't major in IR at CMC anymore, meaning you would take away spots in required lower-level major classes from CMC students, but upper-level elective classes are still open to you.",

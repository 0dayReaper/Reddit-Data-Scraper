I\u2019m from India and I wanted to study economics in the US and have applied to CGU and northeastern for postgraduate studies in Economics with less focus on the math. I was wondering if someone could share their experience doing MA in economics at CGU cause I know it\u2019s a small university so idk if it\u2019s worth me coming all the way when I\u2019ve gotten into city, university of London, Kingston university and SOAS. Someone PLS ADVICE",

If you were a non-student walking around, you might not be able to tell when you had shifted from one campus to another. But once you've walked around a little, it's easy to recognize the signature architectural style of each campus, and very quickly you learn where one campus ends and another begins. So, in some ways it feels like one big campus--for example, there is one main library shared by all the campuses, and you used to be able to eat at any dining hall on any campus, regardless of where you were enrolled (I know that has changed somewhat with COVID protocols, not sure where things will stand Fall 2022). But there are definitely divisions as well. It's not like if you're enrolled at Scripps you have access to every part of Pomona campus. If you want to take a class at another college you have to request permission, and students of that college get priority. And the campuses have different cultures and tend to attract a different kind of student, somewhat.",

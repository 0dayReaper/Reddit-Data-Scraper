There's an addendum based on what your major is. \n\nIn terms of the student body, I'm a staunch, staunch, democrat and I would say that the average person really isn't that conservative. Both of the CMC alum who ran for federal office this past cycle (Steve Bullock for MT Sen. and Candace Valenzuela for U.S. Rep.) were Democrats.\n\nMost everyone is going to be socially liberal at the very least.  There aren't very many socially conservative people (or vocally socially conservative at least). The most \"conservative\" people typically get\u2014in my experience\u2014are students from affluent families who don't believe in taxes but are very socially liberal. \n\nThat's not to say there aren't conservative students, because there are, but the student body as a whole is most definitely left-leaning.",

This definitely eases my worries. :-)\n\nThat aside, how are the professors? I read somewhere on this sub that professors at CMC have a history of donating to Republican organizations. I also found someone\u2019s post from less than a year ago stating they had an outwardly racist professor.",

And I'm happy to ease your concerns a bit. :) My addendum was going to be on professors so I'm glad you asked! \n\nI'm a Government major so I can speak on my experience with Gov profs who you may encounter if you decide to go with the Public Policy Major. It's true that many Gov professors are conservative and the Government courses at CMC are much more likely to be taught with conservative undertones/slants. If you would like to be taught by liberal professors who will teach with a liberal undertone, then perhaps CMC is not the school for you (for Government at least). However, I would say that the Government curriculum is not super outwardly conservative. \n\nWhile I don't agree politically with several Gov. professors I've had, I've always had pleasant experiences with them. Prof. Rossum, for example, is a former employee of the Reagan administration and he absolutely loves both Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. He assigned two of Justice Scalia's books as required texts for our class. I hate Antonin Scalia and I hate the fact that I had to purchase his work. But, Rossum himself is very kind. I emailed him last semester that I had election anxiety and he happily gave me a weeklong extension on our take home midterm, lmao. So, while many Gov profs *are* conservative, they are really nice and super accommodating. There are definitely times when I wish I could have had learned Government through a liberal lens but at the end of the day I don't mind it too much.\n\nAs for donations I can't really speak on professors but it is true that CMC trustees donate overwhelmingly Republican. This is due to the historical conservatism of the institution, though I would say that this is not reflective of who the student body is today. In the future, as the trustees change hands into the younger generation of CMC students, I expect this statistic to change. \n\nHere's a direct quote by a current Gov prof, Pitney (who is a Never-Trump Republican) regarding the donations of CMC trustees. \n\n\u201cThe GOP tilt of the CMC contributions is consistent with the college\u2019s image, even though today\u2019s students are heavily Democratic,\u201d CMC government professor John Pitney said in an email to TSL.\n\nRegarding an outwardly racist professor, I'm sorry that student has encountered that experience and I hope they reported it to DOS. I'm a POC who is also gay and I've never experienced racism or homophobia from any professors. Now I have had a terrible Accounting professor who I hate but it was due to his teaching, lol.",

I think most cmc professors would care more about the strength of the arguments than the ideas, and they would appreciate someone bringing the leftist perspective to the conversation. interestingly enough, I do of a specific case of someone being unfairly graded and needing to appeal for their relatively far-right ideals and political engagement. So what I can also say is that even in the extremely unlikely scenario you're graded unfairly for political ideals, there is a process to appeal it that works and would have objective readers look at your work.",

I will say that the student body professes to be more left-leaning than it is though (mostly standard liberals, which aren't very left imo).",

That has the added benefit of freeing up your elective courses for anything  you're interested in outside of  your major because you weren't stuck with a few specific major courses as your options. it is easy to dual major too, which is less intense than a traditional double major.",

While it\u2019s true that CMC is more conservative than the other 4 C\u2019s, it is in no way indicative of the student body\u2019s overall view. In fact, I\u2019d say most students (as stated above) are socially liberal at least! As you most likely know, CMC doesn\u2019t have fraternities or sororities, so when we have parties, everyone is invited and chills with each other, no matter the political views. Tell you what, I\u2019ll down some shots with you (on me) and we can rant about Trump or Marx all you want! Just send me a PM!\n\nOn the topic of professors: I\u2019d honestly say 98% of them are extremely open and accommodating to varying political views, even if they are conservative leaning. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, all professors challenge you to some degree both liberal and conservative, which I believe helps you grow into a well-rounded individual. I feel I can speak on this since I transferred from UCSD, and the way professors teach are worlds apart: at UCSD, I was only taught one side of the argument. Essays? You can only use the materials provided as \u201cresearch\u201d. But at CMC, you\u2019re free to create your own conclusions using materials both in and out of course material to supplement your analysis. \n\nBut if it\u2019s truly something that bothers you even after taking a couple courses, you have the option of taking Econ or Gov classes at the other colleges (and I\u2019m sure the registrar will help you out with that!) But you should make the choice that best suits you and your mental health if need be. Best of luck!",

            "comment": "It\u2019s true that CMC leans RELATIVELY (fiscal) conservative, but they are not Trump-esque in the slightest. In fact, we know a decent amount of Democratic Socialists, Libertarian Socialists, and Anarchists at CMC. Moreover, as 5C resembles a bigger university, you can always socialise at other schools while using CMC just as a college where you study and utilise its stellar career services. However, do note that there are some outliers that others school won\u2019t have as CMC students are mostly \u201cbusiness\u201d kids. The toxic competition can be seen from time to time. In fact, I as a Pitzer student was (and still am) harassed by a CMC kid for the past 12 months solely because that they assume that I \u201cwill never be successful\u201d as they define success strictly monetarily. \n\nIn conclusion, if you can ignore the toxicity and are willing to socialise with students from the other 4 colleges, you are in for a great job prospect and education whilst not being trapped in a mental drainage.\n\nOf course, that is if you are not morally discouraged to have a career in Finance, which CMC primarily focuses on. Although CMC does have Data Science major and a CS minor (I\u2019ve heard that they are gonna make it a major soon in a year or two, which you can declare later)",

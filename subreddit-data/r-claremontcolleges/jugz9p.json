I could get an apartment with a friend of mine in Claremont but I want to know if it\u2019d even be possible to form a pod or drink coffee outside at cafes. How many kids live nearby doing online school?",

It doesn\u2019t have a late night scene but daytime and evening is always popping. Great places to eat and get coffee. Also good access to LA with the Metrolink. I love it here incase you can\u2019t tell.",

If the town is totally dead, I'll consider moving elsewhere, but seeing as I only have 2 years of undergrad left, it'd be really nice to get into the jive of the town",

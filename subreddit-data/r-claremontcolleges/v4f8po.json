            "comment": "Chase or BofA.   \nMountain Ave Chase (the Indian Hill branch wasn't too helpful) was particularly helpful as an International Student. Takes about an hour or so to make an account with them. If you're under 25yo, you can create a student account, if you're &gt;25 get a normal checking account and you can get a savings account too.  \n\n\nMost credit card companies don't give you one unless you have SSN. I use Deserve Student card, super quick, helpful, build credit score while you work on getting a job offer and SSN.  \nTook a few days, less than a week to get the card activated. You can look it up online too \u2014[deserve.com](https://deserve.com)  \n\n\nSend me a DM and I can send you a referral for the credit card giving us both $30 once you start using it.  \n\n\nThese things took time to figure out and I understand how important they are as well as the struggle. DM if you have any more Qs!",

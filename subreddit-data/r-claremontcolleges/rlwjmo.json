I chose it because it was the best fit for me: small school with professors who truly care about you and support you, supportive/collaborative atmosphere with intelligent peers who really care about their work, the really cool dynamics and opportunities of the consortium (a women\u2019s college within a coed consortium is really the best of both worlds!), and Scripps offered great need-based and merit financial aid. The gorgeous SoCal location didn\u2019t hurt either:)",

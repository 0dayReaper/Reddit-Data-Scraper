    "postText": "I am a sophomore at Boston University looking to apply to cmc to transfer for next semester. I think it\u2019d be a really good fit, but I am wondering if my 3.33 gpa last year might destroy my application. I did really well academically at a prestigious college prep high school, and I feel that everything I offer as an applicant aligns with cmc except my gpa. I got a C+ in one of my classes last semester which I am also concerned about. Does having a C+ completely turn them off of my application, or do I have any chances assuming my essays will be stellar?",

I don\u2019t know what average GPAs look like for a psych major here, so I can\u2019t say. I\u2019m really not trying to be mean, sorry, and i do really wish you the best of luck! I hope you get in!!",

I think the school really cares about fit/impact on campus when evaluating a prospective student. I had a 3.5 when applying and know others with 3.5 so I don't think a 3.33 is that far off.",

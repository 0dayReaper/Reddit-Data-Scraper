I\u2019m planning on doing something \nin policy analysis with a degree in psychology and english. I also want to go to grad school. What has been everyone\u2019s experience with Alumni and career services? How different is it for each college?",

            "comment": "Hey there, recent PZ grad here. Also graduated with psychology and English degrees. I can only speak about the job placement aspect. Echoing the other commenter, it's not really different for each college, since we were able to attend each others' career fairs, we share a Handshake portal, and each school has a designated career services office with similar resources.\n\nAlumni can be really amazing or nonexistent. There are several alumni who still come back to campus to provide career chats or take part in recruiting events, and have been recruiters for students who I've graduated with. Career services is proactive about getting alums to engage with current students; I'm giving a talk in the next month for instance. With the Winter Break shadowing program, it was a great opportunity to shadow an alum or parent's day-to-day and develop connections while \"working\" as well. The people who have been very enthusiastic about continuous engagement have been incredible connections to have.\n\nOn the flip side, there are people who graduate, move across the country for work, and don't take part in as much Alumni outreach because of distance, work, etc. There are also people who graduate and just don't reach back out once they have their degrees in hand. This is how it is for any college you'd go to, and I wouldn't say it means PZ has a weak alumni network. Anytime I come across someone in my city now who I recognize from the 5Cs or who recognizes a Pitzer shirt or hat I'm wearing will always come up to me, and we spark up a conversation. \n\nGrad school placements tend to fare really well, and Pitzer is a known top Fullbright producing school. At least in my year, we had several students matriculate to PhD programs and other top advanced degree programs. Being that the school is so small and you have an opportunity to really get to know your professors, it makes getting rec letters easy and for these rec letters to be stellar. I had one professor who told me he wouldn't write me a catch-all rec letter when I asked, for example, because he wanted to know which specific programs I was applying to so he could curate each letter to best portray me to each program.\n\nIn all honesty, I wouldn't stress too much about jobs, the alumni network, and career services. This is coming from a first-gen low-income student. It's a hard thing to break, but in all honesty, the networking opportunities I've had and the skills and interests I cultivated at Pitzer helped me get to two promotions in my short professional career already. I'm incredibly thankful for the opportunities and the education that I got at Pitzer, and in telling people that I went to Pitzer and the Claremont Colleges during job interviews, the ones who \"get it get it.\" Getting into a 5C school is no easy feat, and the schools are known for having a great academic experience, and I've been able to connect with hiring managers who liked me because of my liberal arts background, how varied my undergraduate academic course load was because of the interdisciplinary studies core value, and because I was someone who was able to see what I could get out of going to a school like Pitzer. \n\nHope this helps!",

I'm a CS major, and this past recruiting season I had no trouble getting interviews at any big name firms, and I got a total of 56 company interviews (half of them come from recruiters inviting me via email), and 12 offers. I will go to a FAANG next summer.",

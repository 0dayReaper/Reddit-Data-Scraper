There was camaraderie behind the scenes, for good or ill, that gave the fireworks a theatrical aspect for those in the spotlight. Now, we still have the theatrics ( I think somewhat more restrained, but that\u2019s arguable) but there\u2019s no release valve. All that pressure just backwashes into the two party machines,  which increases the pressure at the main exhaust points which creates even more backwash etc.  Who pops first? Doesn\u2019t matter, really. Endgame USA either way.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m firmly plugged into the Left Machine. I have friends and relatives who\u2019re plugged into the Right Machine. There\u2019s a lot of shit we don\u2019t talk about because there\u2019s no point. You either accept that the Scientific Principle enables measurement of an objective reality or you don\u2019t. Maybe there\u2019s a way out, but I can\u2019t see it. I would be deeply, deeply happy to be shown wrong.",

Schedule I to Schedule II. \n\nThat is what you're saying. But there are many Dems in the race who  are for de-scheduling it and then legalizing it.\n\nDe-scheduling is removing it from being regulated by the Controlled Substances Act. Therefore, marijuana would effectively not have any schedule and by that effect would be legal.\n\n&gt; he or she has\u00a0several options: keeping marijuana in Schedule I, moving it to another schedule where less restrictive controls prevail, or descheduling it entirely\u2014taking the drug off the list of controlled substances. The latter is legalization in all but name.\n\n[Source](https://prospect.org/day-one-agenda/make-marijuana-effectively-legal/)\n\nBernie's own campaign page for example:\n\n&gt; Under this plan, not only will Bernie take executive action to legalize marijuana by removing it from the Controlled Substance Act,\n\n[Source](https://berniesanders.com/issues/legalizing-marijuana/)\n\nOn top of that, the candidates support legalizing it from Congressional efforts.\n\nThere are 11 candidates who support legalization, 3 who say it's up to the states, and Biden is for decriminalization.\n\n[source](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/marijuana-cannabis-legalization/legalizing-marijuana/)",

People who have different personal sexual identities are discriminated against for no viable reason? Bullshit, let me spend years supporting and marching for them. A drug proven to have medicinal and mostly harmless recreational properties is still illegal and can ruin lives due to its illegal status alone? Bullshit, I plan on decriminalizing it altogether. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t sugarcoat, but he doesn\u2019t excuse either. He says things are absolutely terrible when they are and he gives actual ideas and concrete methods he wants to do to fix them. And best of all, he cuts through the bullshit.",

One year I worked so much goddamn OT I paid into it TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS and had coverage when I was laid off after that job just two months. We can bank hours, but for some shitty reason I can only bank two months not six or more (although others can, there's cockamamie rules for how that's sorted out, some pigs are more equal than other pigs I believe is the policy) and that excess just goes into the fund, not into an HSA in my name or anything. I'm single, no kids.\n\nThis shit we got in America is fucking garbage, union or not. It's garbage. Put that 10 bucks an hour back on my check and tax me some more to pay for my insurance.

            "comment": "I kinda feel like i can hear some of Bernie's frustration in that statement.\n\nI mean, the guy has been willfully ignored by the media for years because he doesn't play the special interest game. He's backed up his beliefs and words for years with his actions.\n\nI was always surprised he didn't poll better with African Americans than Hilary considering there's photos of him being arrested for actually supporting Martin Luther King back when it would not have been popular in powerful society.\n\nHe single-handedly strong-armed the entire Democrat platform to the left! Sorely needed considering how right-wing friendly America has become (at least in terms of electoral representation...).\n\nHe also shattered fund raising records from # of donors. No SuperPAC money. Others have followed in his footsteps like with so many other of his progressive policies that simply look to support people. \n\nWords and actions rarely match for a lifelong politician and they do with Bernie. Some people say he's another \"Old White Man\". Absurd - The guy is a modern day revolutionary that managed to basically stay clean (despite EVERY opportunity behind the scenes not to...) his entire career.\n\nHe has ALWAYS polled well against Trump.\n\nYet, many 'woke' people prefer Warren or some even Cortez (Who basically got her career started with the online grass-roots, Bernie Sanders led Blue Wave supporters...). I would be content, personally, with a Warren-led Presidency. But COME ON!\n\nBernie's campaign previously is basically the only reason Warren has a legitimate shot this year... The left needed the seismic shift that he started (in conjunction with a Trump Victory as motivation, of course).\n\nI'm not American and have little stake in an anything but Trump Presidency.  Bernie is an overlooked leader because he doesn't play many of the games that other politician's play. This is why he was not favored by the DNC and, by extension, not favored by any media outlets. His campaign was run by real people making relatively tiny donations and it still is! \n\nSomeone like Yang seems really cool and I do think UBI is just going to become a fact at some point in the future. But, again, COME ON! \n\nThe only way to reduce corruption and bribery in politics (on both sides with the republicans being FAR worse) is to elect a leader who has managed to stay free from the worst of it over his entire career. He has usually been on the right side of history and is incredibly popular. He genuinely seems like a good, idealistic, person. \n\nYoung and progressive Americans should all be stampeding to this guy. The rural Trump voters SHOULD (but won't) love him or any democrat. He's their ideal candidate as a demographic.\n\nThings will be good enough with Warren IMO. But it really seems that America is missing a huge opportunity to have some proven (relative) honesty from someone in the white house.  Bernie is the what the US really needs.\n\nMaybe it's my own  frustration I hear in that statement - I'll stop interfering in your elections now.",

She's not serious about tackling almost any of our many national emergencies. Warren will be just as blocked as Obama was, but even worse, she won't even get in because polling shows she loses to Trump worse than either Biden or Bernie, who both are projected to beat Trump, with Bernie having the greatest lead over Trump in a general election.",

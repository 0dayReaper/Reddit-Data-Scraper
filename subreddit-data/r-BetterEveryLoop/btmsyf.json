Sort of backs my point though, that some people do really bizarre things for their weddings (you'll see photos of women wearing confederate flags as wedding dresses), and so the national anthem probably falls into a similar vein. These people are generally not the norm, however.",

Friend of theirs, who happens to be the school mascot introduces them.  They spend a lot of time together with their friend at school games, etc.  Now, years later, they are getting married and ask their friend to \u201cbee\u201d there for them and wear the costume that has been so instrumental in their lives together.  \u201cUm, not really sure I should do that.  I mean, I want to be respectful and all...\u201d. \u201cOh, come on... you have to!  It would mean so much to us!\u201d  \u201cWell, I guess if you really want me to.  You want me to do the whole mascot act and all?\u201d\n\nI have had friends that have had bizarre things at their weddings and special celebrations that not everyone understood, but it was exactly what they wanted.

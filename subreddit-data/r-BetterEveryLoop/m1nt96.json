You know those vacuum sealers that top tier weed dealers use for their doobie? It's like that, except for your whole body (including eyes), minus a breathing/throat fucking/drinking (feel free to use your imagination) hole.\n\nAnyone else feel free to add or clear up anything I missed or got wrong. \n\n(Oh and I mentioned hard limits. Those are things you draw a VERY firm line on that can't even be asked about during a \"scene\" (for all intents and purposes, a BDSM moment) or play (other fun sexy times). Soft limits, on the other hand, are things you normally would say no to, but it's okay to ask about again (definitely not forcefully) during those same times. \n\nOne thing which a fuckton of media and almost all porn totally ignores is how central consent is to EVERYTHING in kink. If you've ever heard the line that \"it's subs who really hold the power,\" that's why. Nothing should ever be explored or enjoyed without a before conversation about what people's hard and soft limits are, among other stuff. Other stuff also includes \"aftercare,\" which you see in almost absolutely no porn. No matter how gentle or rough or vicious partners may be with each other, it's crucial to spend time with each other decompressing and making sure everyone's feeling a-okay and ready to go back into the world. Some subs/bottoms may not be into this, but truthfully, I'd be wary of people like this. Sometimes might indicate some trauma, which requires a super experienced partner for them. Not always, but sometimes.)\n\nEdit: thanks for coming to my TED talk. I care a lot about sex and kink positivity because there are so many harmful stigmas against it that are based on giant urban legends. Not only does it harm those who already practice it, but it really does dissuade a lot of people from exploring BDSM. Since I began to, I've realized how much a part of my identity it always has been, and how it's been a major missing puzzle piece in some important past relationships. Take care.\n\nEdit edit: I'd be totally remiss if I didn't recommend anyone interested in kink check out afourchamberedheart.com . It's art house (mostly very hardcore) BDSM erotic flicks, and they're an amazing introduction to the sensuality and emotion behind even the filthiest of kinks. It's all creator owned and operated, and the monthly membership fee is totally worth it (consider it as paying back for all the decades of free porn we've all come to :) ).",

She used to be a dominatrix, and I'm switch, so I think this could really spice things up.  I've been worrying that I'm getting a bit boring in bed, so this will be something I bring up when I talk to her about those (likely entirely unwarranted) worries.\nThank you very much for the tedtalk!\ud83d\ude01",

I'm a switch too and I learned from my ex who was also a professional domme that A LOT of dommes are switch with their partners. They just have reputations they have to uphold.\n\nOh shit, and I hiiiighly recommend investing in The Liberator wedge pillow or anything else from that company if you want something simple that will blow minds. So many people are skeptical of it and figure if anything they can use household items, but these are specifically designed for sexual purposes. My ex laughed at me when I brought it over, but when I was fucking her (I'm a dude), she went crazy because she felt things she'd literally never known it was possible to feel. This girl had a fully stocked dungeon, a sexual past I'm still jealous of, and making a person so experienced feel something like that was definitely a high mark for me.",

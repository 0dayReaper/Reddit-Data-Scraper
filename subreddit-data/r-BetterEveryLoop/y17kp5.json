One of them likely would have taken the mark with or without jumping, but another player behind them saw the opportunity and leapt up at the last second and they didn\u2019t see it coming.",

Tackles have to be below the shoulder and any reckless contact made with another person's head during a bump or tackle will be reviewed by a tribunal, most resulting in fines or suspensions. If someone is concussed, they have to take the next week off and some players wear padded helmets. \n\nThe spekkie (short for spectacular catch, seen above) remains a part of the game basically because it's so iconic and injuries are surprisingly rare.",

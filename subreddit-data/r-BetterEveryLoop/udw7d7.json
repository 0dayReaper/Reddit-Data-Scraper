We then also fully deep dive test it's functionality. This is all done as an independent third party on top of manufacturer and client checks.\n\nWe then also go back every year to assess any deterioration of devices from operation and ensure all necessary safety features are still functional.\n\nNot worth an AMA as I can't really disclose anything interesting due to NDAs etc.",

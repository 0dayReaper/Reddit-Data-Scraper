I played center back (defense) and I remember one game ages and ages ago where the striker I was battling it out with that day turned to me and said \u201cnice kicks\u201d. Now, I thought he was being passive aggressive and whining that I was kicking him, so I looked at him like he was being lame and should go fuck himself.\n\nNow, this is soccer, I spent a lot of time looking at his feet, and I realized immediately that he and I were wearing the same cleats, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it. It wasn\u2019t until well after the game that it clicked to me what \u201ckicks\u201d are. Dude was complimenting me and making a little joke about us having the same shoes and I shrugged him off like he was some whiney dweeb.\n\nI still think about this literal decades later. Turns out I was the dweeb.",

Presumably this is so that it's difficult to predict what kind of serve he's doing. I'd wager him moving his body and face so close to the ball serves the dual purpose of hiding his paddle for longer and giving him more momentum to his serve",

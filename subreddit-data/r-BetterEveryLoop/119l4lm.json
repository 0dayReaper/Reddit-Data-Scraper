He spins 180\u00b0 backside, so a bs 180 body varial, and the board spins 720\u00b0 from the rider's perspective. I slowed it down to 2 fps and kept track of the nose. It's a nollie bs 180 bs 720 shuvit, basically. Maybe there's a shorter (or longer) name for that, but there it is. \"Big spin\" in a ramp feels weird to me because you're not really riding away from the trick in a different direction compared to how you took off. I feel like that's part of the essence of a big spin somehow. I dunno. \ud83e\udd37",

Or Biggerspin in this case. Doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s skating transition the tricks don\u2019t change depending on your personal perspective, if it\u2019s on flat, down some stairs or up a QP. A Fs 180 kickflip up a quarter pipe isn\u2019t called a kick flip cause he rode up regular and came back down regular. He did ride a way in different direction(went in facing coping  and came back down to the coping at his back) it was just strange to you since his stance didn\u2019t change. \n\nSource: been skating for 18 years to this day and I still suck so I could be entirely wrong since I don\u2019t skate transition.",

A rotation is a rotation, like you said.\n\nBut it definitely wasn't a 900 anything, that was my main point.\n\nEdit: sorry, the first trick I mentioned wasn't the final name of the full trick. Only the kick trick. My bad.\n\nThe full trick as I mentioned would be a bs 180 nollie bs 720 shuvit.  A bigger spin would be the board doing a 540 wrt the ground, but this is doing a 900 wrt to the ground, 720 wrt to the rider. \ud83d\udc4d All cleared up.",

Eg. 720 double truckdriver being a 720 spin with two barspins.\n\nJust for the sake of accuracy, I believe a base truckdriver is regular spin and the same direction on the barspin.",

Also though, use context clues - I wasn't literally talking about this video in particular. I was talking about kids doing ACTUAL 900s, 1080s, etc, where their bodies DO spin around a lot.

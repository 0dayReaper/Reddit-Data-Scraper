Unmarried adults dressed up in costumes and visited houses of their choice across town. Here they teased, danced and gathered food and money for the Fastelavn celebration. If married people and the elderly wanted to take part in the festivities, they could put on costumes and visit friends to tease and have fun. These costume games were not liked by the Church and the authorities, and were outlawed in 1683\n  \nthis is what you're talking about? I can see it being similar to trick or treating I suppose lol",

Fastelavn is alot like Halloween, kids dress up in costumes, go around in the neighbourhood, ring on doorbells and sing silly songs when people open the door. But instead of candy they are given small amounts of cash.\n\nThe particular custom in the video is \"sl\u00e5 katten af t\u00f8nden\" (roughly translated to \"hit the cat out of the barrel\". In the game, the participants takes turn hitting a barrel with a bat. Like a pinata, the barrel is filled with candy. The game usually has two winners: The person who hit the candy out of the barrel is named the cat queen and one the who hits the final piece of the barrel of the rope is cat king. According too folklore, people used to put black cats inside the barrels, to punish them for being familiars to witches.\n\nBut why the guy is riding a bike, I have no idea of. This isn't usually part of the game.",

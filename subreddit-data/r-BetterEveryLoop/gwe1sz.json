But from an excitement point of view it's a bit of a shame.\n\nThere was a fire in the Williams garage whilst Frank was in there a few years ago. Although thankfully the guys got it out quickly and everyone was unharmed, and Frank had been wheeled out the back. \n\nFerrari had an incident in 2008 where Massa left the pit box with the hose attached. Injuring his mechanics holding the hose and spraying fuel everywhere.\n\nThere's been several high profile burns/oh fuck moments with refuelling. But it was something else for the teams to get wrong. Even more dangerous with the hybrid engine era. If you look at a modern car the \"T cam\" (camera above the drivers head for inboard shots) there's a coloured LED facing forward. It changes to green to say the car is \"Safe\" - Marshalls generally won't touch the car unless its tripped to green to avoid them being shocked. Mechanics who work on the hybrid system can usually be seen in rubber gloves that cover up to the elbow.",

There has also been a ton of work involving combustion that has happened, they started using TJI (turbulent jet ignition) for example. There is also a lot of work to make things lighter and cool more quickly in the head so that they can run leaner mixes without worrying about detonation and the lighter rotating mass must help as well. Plus the fuel and oil science that goes on in the background.\n\nSo, considering KERS was part of the V8 era and they did not have the thermal efficiency they have now, I disagree that regenerative braking is the 'key' to the thermal efficiency.\n\nEdit: also the closer we try to get to 100% the more the focus becomes how to burn and extract energy from every last bit of that droplet of fuel, which is why being able to run a lean mix without detonation, the composition of the fuel, and even the swirl pattern of the intake air charge becomes important. Recovering kinetic energy, I assume, can only get you so far if you are not able to fully exploit the fuel being burned.",

They sound different but it's still a beautiful sound.\n\nThe teams ended up changing exhaust designs to make them sound 'throatier' at the beginning of the hybrid era.\n\nExcept the Honda. When the drivers lift off into a corner, that sounds like a VTEC popping away.",

However the engines (now known as power units) are hybrid and the electric motor provides around 165bhp the drivers can use for around 30 seconds a lap so they can finish the race by driving tactically. \n\nIt\u2019s now a battle of tactics, save fuel in certain corners by lifting off and letting the dynamo recharge the battery, then full throttle in the main straights for example. Plus because the cars use about 1-2kgs of fuel per lap (depending on the track length) the cars are continuously getting faster and faster as the weight comes down as well as more fuel efficient.",

There is at least no mention of it, but I wouldn't doubt it that someone got hurt.\n\n&gt; In the pits, Ferrari prematurely released Massa with the fuel hose still attached to the car. The Brazilian was also released into the path of Adrian Sutil, who narrowly avoided the Ferrari. Massa went the full length of the pitlane before stopping just before the exit. Massa rejoined at the back of the field after the Ferrari mechanics ran down the pitlane and removed the hose from the car.\n\nBut reading through the 2008 Singapore GP entry, ban on mid-race refueling was a good idea when we consider the whole Piquet Jr crash &amp; Alonso^(1) thing ontop of the cost &amp; security issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n^(1): Renault told Piquet to crash at a specific point of the track in order to give his teammate Alonsos \"aggressive\" fuel strat the edge and finished first (started 15th). The fuel strat essentially gambled for a safety car which Piquet later forced by crashing.",

The introduction of KERS (ie Hybrid engines) into the sport also makes a huge difference, and the sport is moving toward a greener image so the lack of refueling is a part of that.\n\nI\u2019ve watched lots of older races when there was refueling, and for my part I kind of like it without refueling.\n\n(That video of the fire, interestingly enough, involves a driver who\u2019s the father of the driver in the original post, Max Verstappen).",

They build the garages once the teams arrive at the track for the race weekend, assemble the cars, and maintain/repair the cars all weekend. \n\nThat said, some of them have more important non-pit stop jobs than others. And some teams have more dedicated pit stop crew members. The higher pressure positions (wheel gun, front and rear jacks) might have less to do on a race weekend than the stabilizers, because they have to be fresh for the pit stops. \n\nBut that changes by team as well. Williams, the worst teams on track for the past two years, has some of the best pit stop times because they\u2019ve got a handful of dedicated pit stop crew members that train for pit stops all year long.",

Are you saying the jack gets pulled with the car if there's an early release and his arms get stretched out holding the jack?\n\nBecause if that's what you meant, that's not possible. The car is rear wheel driven, so the car can't physically move until he specifically puts the rear wheels back on the ground. This means he's free from the car before it can go anywhere where the jack can't get pulled along with it.",

Those cars a much heavier (lmp1 min ~880 kg, f1 740 kg) and the number of stops are much higher. Most f1 races will only have 1-2 stop, maybe 3 baring any unforeseen issues (front wing breakage usually).",

Nearly two seconds is a lifetime in F1, therefore they practice pit stops alot. \n\nOne team in the 2018 season suffered two misfitted wheels in one race. Both cars had to retire. This is really really rare though. Every team has to develop their own lugs and wrenches so thrre are differences in pit stop speeds. Red Bull has been the absolute king of pit stops in 2019, while a team like McLaren lose maybe a tenth on average on pit stops compared to them.",

That's why you see a lot of locking brakes when they hit the first corner in a race, because they didn't manage to heat them up enough yet. The stopping power of these things is insane, you can hit 5+G's just braking and you can go from like 340km/h to 135km/h in 1.64 seconds. And then to think of the fact that every so often they introduce rules to make the cars slower, because if they kept the old rules new technology would make them way too fast.",

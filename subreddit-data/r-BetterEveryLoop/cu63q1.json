We were on a pretty small GA airport that wasn't really equipped to get this giant trailer to our hangar, but there was a way.  I asked the truck driver if he could back up the trailer through a perilous course of chain link fence and gravel and I'll never forget his response.  He said, \"I can do magical things with this bad boy\", and then he proceeded to back that trailer right up to our hangar no problem.\n\nFucking balls on that guy",

I was a mile from the ramp in the second to the left lane. I engaged my turn signal. Waited and began to move over, half a mile to go. Half way I to the lane a Dodge Grand caravan whipped out from behind me and attempted to pass forcing me to miss the exit or crash. \n\nThis driver in this gif was extremely lucky that everyone decided to drive  correctly and actually stopped before the stop lines.",

It is highly likely, though, that I end up going into a skid or jackknife and losing control - which could be disastrous for many people.\n\nHope this helped answer your question and gave you some perspective from a truck driver. This was a great question, pal.\n\n\nEdit: Fixed some grammar.",

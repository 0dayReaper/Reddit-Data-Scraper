By default it's black with a happy face, but you can flip it to a bright yellow sad egg face so the servers know at a glance that you need something. It's a really great system, works really well when it's super busy and crowded.  I'm surprised they're the only restaurant I've seen that has that sort of thing.",

I felt so rude shouting out every time.\n\nSome of the best service I've gotten though was at a bar in Japan where all of the servers would stand at a centralized location looking for those who needed help.

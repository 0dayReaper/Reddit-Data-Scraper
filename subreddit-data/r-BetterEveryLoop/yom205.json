Elastic collisions are really wacky at preserving kinetic energy and transferring momentum to things with less mass. Which is why these ball bouncing stunts are so crazy, and why the cup takes off so much faster than it was falling.\n\nThe ~~safest~~ safer way to play with this and become familiar is with two differently sized rubber balls. Balance the smaller ball on the larger, and drop the set on a hard surface. Near all of the _system's_ downward energy gets transfered to the small ball only, and it takes off like a bullet. This is the \"magnets: how do they work\" of the elastic collision world.\n\n[1] Is been 2 decades since I studied this, so I'm likely be off on the physics here and there. Corrections happily welcomed.",

However, a trampoline translates the energy of the person (falling) into stored spring energy, and only returns that energy to the person (pushing them back up). The trampoline doesn't have it's own kinetic energy _also_ being added into the collision.\n\nNow, if you fired a trampoline _upwards_ at a person falling down, **that** would be interesting. Or if the trampoline had springy legs and you dropped both the trampoline and person together. But the mass of most trampolines is in the frame, and that tends to not have an elastic relationship with the earth. A great example of an elastic collision and momentum (energy) exchange is in people and exercise balls. The balls ensure a highly elastic collision, so the people exchange KE and the momentum of the system is preserved. As a result, the heavier person tends to have very little movement after, and the smaller person, [well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cY8IW0eal0)\n\nDisclosure: again, it's been literal decades and I'm being a little sloppy between energy and momentum here. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/linear-momentum/elastic-and-inelastic-collisions/a/what-are-elastic-and-inelastic-collisions) explains it very well!",

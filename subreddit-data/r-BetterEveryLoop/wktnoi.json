Missed her by a fucking a hair.\n\nSudden sharp swerve out of the lane and back paired with a loud and startled \"Holy shit!\".  Meanwhile my 4yo in the back, chill as can be, non chalantly asks, \"What's the matter, Mommy?  You almost got that deer?\"  I'm all hopped up on adrenaline and she had no fucks to give that was almost decapitated a deer and/or crashed, lol.\n\nDumbass deer didn't seem that phased either XD",

Like a falcon spotting a mouse and swooping in at the right time, or or a bear fishing with its bare paws, or an orangutan swinging from branch to branch without ever missing. Orangutans actually have superior depth perception to humans and as a result of this and they can untie knots faster than because they can more easily distinguish which parts of the knot are above and below each other.\n\nDeer may have an inferior sense of space, but I feel like the reason they get hit is their fight or flight mode is a little wonky and they get overwhelmed and freeze up when all that cortisol and adrenaline starts going to their brains. Or maybe they're just really dumb animals.\n\nBut my point is most animals have comparable spatial awareness to humans and don't get hit by cars. So saying an animal gets hit by cars because it's an animal makes no sense.",

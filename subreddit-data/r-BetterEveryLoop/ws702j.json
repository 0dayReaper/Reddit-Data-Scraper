Zabaleta played as a defender and in this match (West Ham 0 Chelsea 0, 23rd September 2018) his side kept a clean sheet against a team who ended the season seven places ahead of them. It\u2019s obviously embarrassing for a professional footballer to make a mistake like this but he succeeded in stopping the other team scoring in a game when the likelihood was that they would and *that\u2019s* what he was paid a lot for. Given that this incident had no effect on the outcome of the match I imagine Zabaleta, his teammates and his employers found this little slip-up as funny as the Chelsea fan did once the final whistle had gone.",

Everyone around him flinches hard. There is a net that can\u2019t really be seen that deflects the ball.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment.

His company has advertisements all over Fenway, and he shows up to every game and sits directly behind home plate in the stands. Though there is a screen in front of the seats behind home plate to block foul balls, people still flinch or duck instinctively when stray balls come flying at them. However, Dennis Drinkwater never does, and the cameras often catch him sitting, calmly, as the balls seem to be flying directly at his face. He's been in the same seat for every home game since 2003.\n\nhttps://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/dennis-drinkwater-net-worth/",

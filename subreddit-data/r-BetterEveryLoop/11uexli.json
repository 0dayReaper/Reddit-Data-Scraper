I could do infinite chinups on monkey bars in kindergarten, and the monkey bar chicken game where you try to make the other kid fall, I was always the tiniest person playing and absolutely unstoppable. I could hang one handed with a tubby kid hanging on to just me.  For a long enough time to make it completely irrational that it was happening (even to me tbh).\n\nIm not exactly sure what the \"body type\" is, but I can say you're absolutely right about it :)  I'm 50 and can still do chinups easy af, my physical limit is actually the \"woozy\" part of it.  I can do backflips on my kids' jumpoline, but I can't keep track of gravity like I used to be able to when doing them (yeah, that makes it sketchy/dangerous I suppose...).\n\nI've got some sort of natural mechanical advantage that causes this.  There's simply no other explanation, because I've always been this way.  Young, old, it's always been there...",

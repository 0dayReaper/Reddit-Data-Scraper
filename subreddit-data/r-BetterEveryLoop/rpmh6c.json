These days too many dojos see the amount of money they can make if they made getting a black belt super easy and within a short period of time. Also the fact that in competition you literally can get DQ'd for kicking too hard and score points by utilizing speed over power is just straight up stupid. Back in the day though, they focused a lot more on power rather than speed. I remember Joe Rogan talking about one time when he was watching a match, and one of the guys got knocked out and would NOT get back up, and his coach told him that sometimes people die. \n\nAnyway, what I'm trying to say is that too many TKD practitioners these days focus on speed and volume over power, and it's pretty sad to see. However, I suppose there's always guys like Pettis back in the day and Edson Barboza who do have a lot more power behind their kicks.",

Close to a decade if I recall right, though there were definitely other students that got through without putting as much effort in and it showed in a lot of ways. \n\nThe prices and money grabbing are very very evident these days though. I know my instructor wouldn\u2019t charge people anything if it was feasible, and I wouldn\u2019t either if I was one.

The main thing that jumps out to me is the colour space the render exists in and the depth of field. \n\nNormally if you stand back and zoom in, you can cut the DOF out but the background is pretty sharp.\n\nThe main thing is the lack of brightness from the wire. Normally if you try to take a photo of something emitting light, it blows out the sensor, exposes everything on it as white due to range clipping. Otherwise you would need to change the exposure to view the wire and everything that isn't the filament would be really dark. This is something we don't normally ever see, even in photographs and is the elephant in the room on its lack of photorealism. Just try to stare at your lightbulb to know what I mean.\n\nAlso looks like an ourdoor HDRI in an indoor setting.",

It will smoke and burn within a couple seconds if the bulb isn't sealed, but the more typical failure mechanism is getting bent back and forth a lot from thermal cycling whenever you turn the bulb on and off. If you leave the bulb on continuously, it will last a lot longer. \n\nIf the filament does break while the bulb is on, you'll get an arc at the failure point for a bit, which can vaporize a little bit of the filament. This is where the dark spots come from on a burnt out bulb.\n\nAs for swinging around like a loose fire hose, no it might spring a little bit, but not that much. \n\nHere's an actual video of a light bulb filament burning in air: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCX6BdbCUaA\n\nAnd burning out normally: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTcSFqbkgx4",

            "comment": "This just reminded me of a dog we got when I was a teenager. We had a couple of indoor/outdoor cats with one being the Queen. New dog comes into the kitchen, joyfully sniffing around until it rounded the corner and saw the cat eating, trotted over to see what was up and made the horrible, horrible decision to \"nose bump\" the cat out of the way to get to her food. Cat hardly batted an eye as she took one paw, claws out, and whacked him across the nose. Dog howled and started trying to back up and just stayed in place on the tile floor gaining zero traction. Cat thumped him a good dozen times before we could react and grab her. Opened up his poor nose all the way across like she had a straight razor.  To the vets, stitches, cone, and antibiotics.  Cat lived to be 20 or so, another 10 years after this happened, and dog would just freeze, shake, and not so much even look at her every time he saw her, inside, outside didn't matter.  I still feel guilty about laughing, hell I don't think I saw my Dad laugh that hard ever, after I saw his nose but the sight of the dog kicking into reverse and legs looking like 4 fan blades spinning but not moving a MM and cat just picking shots over and over was hilarious.  In cats defense, the 2 dogs we had before always ate the cat food and she never did anything like the hell she rained down on him that morning.  I also think cat purposely terrorized dog, would slowly walk up, spin and then lay down pressing against him in front of our woodstove, poor dog would just lay there, eyes wide open with it's brow furrowed as long as cat was there.",

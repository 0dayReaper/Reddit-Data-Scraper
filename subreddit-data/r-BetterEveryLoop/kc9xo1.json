Most of them know if you\u2019re scared of them. And they will terrorize you if you are. If you give them a reason to believe they have power over you, it goes straight to their heads and they will convince you they do. If you\u2019re not scared of them and don\u2019t act like you are, they\u2019re far more likely to not try to terrify you. My uncle is scared of the bird so the bird lands on him, nips him, etc. My moms friend isn\u2019t scared of him or of holding him, so he sits on her shoulder and gives her kisses. Birds are the masters of mental games.",

Sorry, my sleep-deprived brain is a bit loopy this morning and I just couldn't help myself. Seriously, though, renting out sone pets on a try-before-you-buy basis would be helpful. Cockatoo, chinchilla, hedgehog, bearded dragon, etc. Might end up with fewer abandoned or abused or just poorly kept pets that way.",

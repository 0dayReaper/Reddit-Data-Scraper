Kicked in my PTSD of that place.\n\nI moved from San Diego in 2000 when I was 20. To a 1/2 bedroom studio, right on the beach in Pompano Beach. I quickly learned, there are no waves in Florida. The water is completely clear, compared to Cali water where you can only see a few feet through most of the time. If a shark was next to you in Cali, you probably wouldn't know. Out of sight, out of mind. Florida, has like 100x more critters in the water... that you can see.... right there at the edge of the sand/water. Jumping into the water where I lived in Florida, felt like getting dumped into the middle of the Serengeti, with nothing but board shorts on.\n\nGot surrounded by a bunch of sharks about 200 out yards out on a sand bar once, that was \"fun\" /s. I also never heard of sea lice before... good times. I should write a book, \"What I wish I knew about Florida, before moving to Florida\". It would be a big ass book. \n\nYeah, mountain bikes and Florida is kinda an oxymoron.\n\nThat board is sick. My dumbass would have to wear a full face helmet though where I live near San Diego. It's very hilly here, and I'd do something stupid... again lol\n\nI actually got an electric bicycle recently. If you haven't tried one, it's addicting. Although, thinking about it, the summer heat of Florida would probably make the batteries explode or something. lol",

Sprained ankles can range from every few months to every few years. Breaking bones is far less common but honesty sprains can be worse. Probably a LOT of untreated concussions in skating. Less in BMX.\n\nFor example, Nyjah, who is considered to be the most consistent and best big hand rail skater to ever live, says he gets injured about every 3 months. He, to be fair, is a special case as he is throwing himself down 20 sets of stairs multiple times a day.",

Tied with Dave Mirra for xgames medals. Truly one of the best. But he regularly put his body on the line. With some strange irony, he never got truly hurt on the big stuff. A few years back, he was doing a minor trick, landed it, and went to ride away. His front wheel caught a hole and he went over the bars onto his head (wearing a helmet). He instantly became paralyzed from the neck down. The following months saw him slowly regain use of his voice and arms but at the same time he had to have his forehead removed due to swelling.\n\nMost expected, including doctors, that he wouldn\u2019t walk or stand ever again. Except Scotty is barely human. You don\u2019t get that many gold medals and not have a fucking hunger in you. He slowly gained the ability to stand again and began the achingly slow process of progressing from a powered wheel chair to normal wheelchair to walker to cane to nothing at all. Soon he was walking again. Then he did what pretty much no one thought he would ever be able to do again: got on a bike. He was slow at first but in the last 4 years he\u2019s gone from bed ridden to catching air and grinding ledges. \n\nIf I\u2019m gushing it\u2019s because he\u2019s honestly like a hero. This whole time he documented everything on his YouTube channel. While it was heart breaking to watch him without a skull, this dude has not given up on trying to ride again because he knows he\u2019s an inspiration to kids/anyone who needs to hear his story.",

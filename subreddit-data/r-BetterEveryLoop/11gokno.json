Got really into it at 19 or so for a few years but inevitably stopped for whatever reason.\n\nIt was actually my wife that pushed us to get into it again. Over lockdown, I showed her the King of the Road years that Vice filmed with Thrasher and she loved it. It's tough learning at this age because slams hurt so much more, she actually broke her wrist last year but got straight back on the board out of the cast. I'm currently nursing a lil bit of whiplash too.\n\nCool to hear you're traveling the distance to support skate shops mate, it's convenient to buy online but makes a difference to the scene by going to a shop. We're spoilt where we live, the scene is pretty good in England so you're never too far from a skate shop in built up towns. Hope to see your pallet box posted somewhere on here",

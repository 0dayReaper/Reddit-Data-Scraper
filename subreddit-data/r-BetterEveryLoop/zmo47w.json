I had been standing on the armored truck footboards, using the truck for cover and shooting my rifle over the top when I kept getting this weird stinging/slap feeling along my upper arm and neck, but I was ignoring it and still shooting when something bigger slapped me hard right above my upper lip, so that it knocked me back and I fell off the truck.  On the ground I felt my face hurt, but realized I couldn't have really *been shot* but that it was spall from incoming enemy machinegun rounds impacting inches from my head. So I decided to stay down for a minute and take a breath. The puncture was deep enough to draw a little trickle. \n\nFunny side note for the military folk reading who know: my buddy has helmet cam footage of me from that day, right after I fell.  He had come running over from his position to mine with a Karl Gustav rocket launcher on his shoulder, and asked me what happened to my face and if I was ok. I sounded drunk from getting blown up earlier that morning by an IED, and my head was throbbing hard.  I'm answering him while looking elsewhere, then I look over and see his rocket launcher on his shoulder and my entire attitude changes instantly on the footage.\n\nIf you don't know, the Karl Gustav recoilless rifle (rocket launcher, affectionately known as the \"Karl G\") is basically a minor concussion for the person shooting it, and anyone close-by to someone shooting it.  The blast from the rocket launch is an explosion itself, and because it is such a danger to your brain we limit you from firing more than two rounds per day maximum during training.  It will give you a headache from firing it just once.  With an already seriously rattled brain thumping away in anger, you would absolutely NOT want that thing going off within 100 meters of you.\n\nConcussed and slurring, I looked over and froze a second, then started yelling \"IF YOU FIRE THAT FUCKING THING ANYWHERE NEAR ME I SWEAR I WILL SHOOT YOU.\" \n\nI took a picture shortly after, you can see it's pretty minor, and the spall that hit my upper arm through my uniform just barely broke any skin. Also notice my nose is swollen huge from the blast concussion earlier https://imgur.com/gallery/Rp3B5Fu",

Some steel armor plates have layered heavy felting and other materials on the face that are somewhat effective at catching most spalling, but most US steel armor plates, (looking at you AR500 and Spartan Armor) have nothing more than a layer of rhinoliner pissed on the front which does basically nothing to stop spall.\n\nSteel can also be heavier than equivalent rated ceramic plates.",

Although I would say it's a trade-off because it means you won't do as much damage as something like a hollow point.\n\n\nTo give a very oversimplified summary. Hit a soft thing like person it does what you want a bullet to do. Hit hard thing and it will turn into powder not going anywhere you don't want it to. Although frangible rounds are still not perfect. For example if you want to make sure you do as much damage as possible to actually take your target down hollow points or one of their variants are still better. People have survived a ton of a gunshots and still kept going on to do a lot of damage before going down. Having watched a lot of police videos It's pretty horrifying the amount of mortal wounds a person can take and still keep going for a significant amount of time. Some of them get shot a ton and aren't even taken down at all. Bullets are not anywhere near guarantees to stop a threat like a lot of people assume.\n\n\nThere's a couple different reasons and none of them are the exact reason for them being made, but some of them are:\n\n\nIf you are shooting hard targets the bullets disintegrate into very tiny pieces instead of ricocheting or turning into spalling(tiny bullet fragments essentially shrapnel).\n\n\nIf you hit a soft target such as a person it should still do it's intended effect. At the same time if you miss or go through it should break up and not hit anyone on the other side of a wall.\n\n\nImagine you are a cop on the sidewalk and someone is charging at you with a knife. If you miss and hit the sidewalk the bullet could ricochet and hit someone. The bullet could also turn into spalling and damage someone that wasn't even directly behind it because spalling spreads out. Next imagine you do hit but it's with a solid bullet such as FMJ. The bullet will go right through and still have a lot of energy causing the exact same problem as the previous scenario.\n\n\nIn the end personally I only really see it's value in target shooting where you are shooting at something like metal. For scenarios such as police good aim and something akin to hollow points are much better since they will take the attacker down quicker. I can kind of understand someone using it to defend their home, but It's the same scenario where ultimately training and hollow point types would be better.\n\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask!",

A lot of refining but not many large leaps. A good example of that is people still finding the maxim machine gun still in use such as in the conflict in Ukraine. That gun was designed in 1884.\n\n\nGuns aren't for everyone. I have a few, but some people get way too into it. I find them important, but I also don't really want to make it a personality trait like some people do. Although I do find them very fascinating in regards to their engineering.",

For soft points, open tipped match, and hollow point bullets, they draw the jacket from the rear of the bullet to the front. For full metal jacket rounds, they usually draw the copper jacket from the tip to the rear, which leaves an exposed lead tail.\n\nIn this video, it\u2019s clear that the jacket is drawn from the rear, which is why there is a little button of copper toward the conclusion of the impact.",

Yes, I downloaded it from youtube back in the day, I did not have my own internet and my phone had only 4gb of memory, so I'd go to the library, connect to the public wifi and download videos to watch back at home later.\n\nPlaying it again, the drum and bass sections in the beginning are VERY similar, infact I thought they were the same but pitch shifted down, but no, they start to differ a lot as it goes on. I can send you the original if you like, as soon as I can find a place to temporarily host a 50mb video.",

He\u2019s pulled off combos that have rarely, if ever, been repeated even 20 and 30 years after he first landed them. He\u2019s still better in his 50s than most skaters at any age. \n\nI personally consider him the GOAT.",

Simply put, Bony Tony was a flagship.  He was this lanky, goofy looking dude who could pull off an amazing amount of tricks and had his own repertoire in vert.  He looked awesome flying outta things like the Kona Bowl and dressed hilariously loud (the dude loved the hot pink) and was hilarious.  Kids wanted to be Tony Hawk and man was there a lot of Powell stuff sold on his looks and appeal.\n\nNow Mullen....Mullen was...quiet.  Like way quiet.  Some took it as aloof but really, he was painfully shy.  He only seemed to be sorta free while on his board, otherwise he kinda shrank away from stuff like advertising and such.\n\nHalf was himself, but another half was Rodney had incredible low self esteem...he sometimes said he felt like a phony for being a guy who was incredibly talented.  \n\nMatters weren\u2019t helped by his dad who basically browbeat poor Rodney and his \u2018stupid skateboard thing\u2019 and told him he was wasting his life. (Seriously, a guy who a lot of people consider a legend and his own dad used to tell him to quit and grow up and get a real job)\n\nAll that culminated into a unbelievable skater who wouldn\u2019t say 2 words and was embarrassed by his own talent.   It\u2019s amazing we had him all things considered.\n\nHell even Tony Hawk has admitted he was happy that Mullen stuck to street...because he may have eclipsed him in vert if he put as much work as he did on flat.",

But there were always good challengers..McGill, Mountain, Lucero, Gator, Caballero, Hosoi and there were upsets with guys rolling out maybe a gigantic air or (rarely) a new trick to take top spot.\n\nNot with Mullen, hell never with Mullen except *once*.\n\nRodney had a work ethic that could best be thought of as insane. He literally had a small bare patch of cement at his home where he would go late into the night practicing....6 to 7 hours after coming home from school. Every night...*for years*.\n\nHe came out and blew away with his first competition, his second, his third with tricks no one had ever seen. Went pro, signed with Powell Peralta...still kept on practicing.\n\nTommy Guerrero said when he toured with Mullen and the rest of the Bones Brigade they would do like a 2 or 3 demos or a competition and literally work 12 hours. The entire team would hit the hotel wrecked from exhaustion...and then Mullen would say \"*see ya*\u201d and disappear for half the night to go practice and skate.  They would pack up for the next road trip, Mullen would suddenly pop up, get in the van, and crash and sleep till the next demo.\n\nHere another thing...Mullens tricks would magically appear between his showings at competitions as well. Caballero said Mullen would come up with at least one new trick he could nail and 2 or 3 he had cooking to try....per competition. He drove the announcers insane simply because they didn't know what the fuck to call them as they were brand new.\n\nCan you imagine a guy who didn't say much, would show up and dominate with natural tricks, then pop off 2 new tricks you have never seen before *ever*. And he built upon them. He learned how to Ollie-pop...then he invented the kickflip...then worked off that to learn the Ollie impossible. And built the very foundations of modern Streetskating by introducing them in the early 80s.\n\nNow think of this...you got a guy who made the very basic tenets of street skating where everyone was practicing and using *his tricks* for 10 years to build careers and launch an entire new part of the sport ...and then he shows up and reinvents flip techniques with Underflips and all the variations. And Darkslides and *those variations*. And Casper Flips and *those variations*. He breaks down what he has mastered and comes back showing entirely *new ways to do his own tricks*!\n\nMullen will *never* be equaled. His very legacy is that he not only separated himself from others by being the very best at what he could do....*but then saying that wasn't good enough*.",

This was probably THE skate video that convinced me skateboarding was one of the coolest things a human could do. \n\nJust Rodney, his skateboard, and the pavement. And my 5 year old brain was exploded. \n\nId imagine I probably asked for a skateboard once a week for 9 months until I finally got one for Christmas.\n\nI\u2019m 22 now. I\u2019ve been through a lot and couldn\u2019t always skate. But I still think it\u2019s one of the most beautiful and gratifying experiences I can have.\n\nDespite my best efforts, my back hurts, my stomach hurts, my legs hurt. Just one of those days. But I\u2019m still gonna go skate when the sun gets low.\n\nEspecially now that I saw this.\nRodney shreds, Jaws shreds\nRIP Phelps",

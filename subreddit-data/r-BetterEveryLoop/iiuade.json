He's going straight through the air which makes it look like he pauses, but he's bringing his foot down to catch himself. \n\nYou can also see that he set himself up to do that flip. He falls off the left side of the board, so naturally he would have rolled to the left. Instead he rolls to the right onto his back before bringing his legs up and over his head allowing him to do the flip.\n\nThis dude has most likely done some sort of tumbling or martial arts where he learned how to fall and use his momentum",

As he's falling onto his back his legs are straight, but he bends them and then pops them up to help lift his body into the air. Then with the momentum he already had he can rotate enough to put a foot down. What he did goes beyond just trying not to break your wrist when you bail, he definitely has experience throwing his body weight around",

Can't remember if I scored or not, but I was going headfirst when I just tucked, rolled through and pushed on my shoulders and back and launched back up to my feet. I felt superhuman for all of 2 seconds. \n\nI can barely do a somersault, but I could do that when I was going to go head first into the gym floor. Reflexes kicking in and totally taking over is insane feeling.",

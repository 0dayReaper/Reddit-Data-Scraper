I'm quite certain of what I wrote in that comment earlier: I'm inspired by their relationship with the plant, the way they respected it. And then it was turned into a product, with a name and a brand recognition, for cowboys or white collars, or expensive looking cheap ones, thin ones for the ladies, menthol ones for the insane...\n\nI wasn't smoking, or let's say consuming it as a product before either. But with this ancient, respectful, sacred understanding and treatment to the plant by the native people of the planet, my view of cigarettes changed from being mainly a cancer causing item, to a trick that we've been caught up in. This whole experience elevated my view of a lot of things; the grace, the wisdom, such details, such functions... For example, perhaps in some language dialect, there is no word for \"Please\". Because it is not needed to be said. It's already hinted, in, every, word, question or answer. These types of humble yet super divine approaches are what I find fascinating: I'm not trying to find a way out of cancer or trying to fool myself. \n\nSome will do this, some will do that; and maybe it's less about *what* we do, and more about \"how\" we do it, and also \"why\", really? Like, after this realization, I stopped smoking out of grief or sadness or depressive states. This alone changed the entirety of my relationship with the plant.",

Consider what happens if the actor gets injured during that stunt.  \n\n1.  If it's Chris Evans + Stunt man and the stunt man get injured the movie can continue to be filmed which the stunt man recovers.  Evan's other scenes can be filmed   \n2.  If it is just a single actor doing both stunts and the role, the entire movie needs to be put on hold while the actor heals.  Since no filming can happen, a whole lot of jobs and incomes are now at issue     \n\nI think issue 2 happened with one of the Mission Impossible movies where Cruise got injured and everything needed to be paused.   Actors not fit to act can screw up a lot of things; Consider the issues that the Street Fighter movie had when Raul Julia showed up half dead from cancer and all of scheduling had to be redone (Which caused a lot of issues with the stunt dept).\n\nFrom a Danny Trejo interview:  \n&gt; FOX411: Speaking of whacking people, you\u2019ve done a lot of your own stunts, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  Trejo: No. First of all, making movies is a business. Now all you actors that want to disagree me, I dare you. The reality is insurance companies won\u2019t let us do our own stunts. We have professionals, just like I\u2019m a professional artist. What I do is, \u201cTo be or not to be in the barrio,\u201d that\u2019s what I do. A stunt guy pads up and goes through a wall. That\u2019s his profession. Every time the profession\u2019s mixed, I don\u2019t want to risk 80 people\u2019s jobs just so I can say I have big nuts. I don\u2019t want to say that. Norm Mora is my stunt man, that\u2019s his profession.  \n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bad-ass-danny-trejo-actors-who-do-their-own-stunts-are-crazy",

I was a professional actor for about ten years (I quit in my late twenties), I studied martial arts and combat training etc. and people often told me I should look into stunt work. I found out after a bit of research that it is VERY tough. Plus, I wanted to act more than I wanted to do stunts :)\n\nI knew a few stunt performers when I was in the industry. They were some of the most bad ass, physically fit people I ever met. Is it Tom Cruise who does a lot of his own stunt work? No wonder people go nuts about it, it's rare.",

Ray Park is an amazing martial artist, but has a kind of squeeky voice that doesn't go with the badasses he usually plays.\n\nRay Park was cast as Darth Maul because the role involved some grunts and a lot of saber-fighting.  He was an amazing Saber Fighter and they could fake the rest, same when he was cast as Toad in the first X-Men.  (In the comics, Toad speaks fine.  They made him mute in the movie so Park didn't have to talk)\n\nWhen Darth Maul had a Cameo in Solo, they had Ray Park as the body but had  Sa Witwer (the voice actor from Clone Wars) dub the voice so Park's voice wouldn't sound silly.  That's fine for a Cameo with a line or two over a fuzzy communication system.  If Maul was going to be a major character with lost of lines in a live action movie they might have to re-cast him.",

While McQuarrie initially gave the producers of Justice League permission to have Cavill shave the mustache in exchange for the $3 million it would cost to shut down production on Fallout and then digitally fill the mustache in, executives from Paramount rejected the idea,[32] forcing Justice League's VFX team to use special effects to digitally remove the mustache in post-production.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise is directly responsible for Superman\u2019s upper lip in JL!",

Deadpool 2 was the latest that rings a bell. \n\nI remember hearing about stunt workers on a BTS of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Vic Armstrong was the stunt coordinator and there was a time I was sure that's what I wanted do in life...I was 9 when Raiders came out. Being dragged behind a truck or car sounded like fun!\n\nWe lived near a nice sized forest and there was all kinds of \"stunts\" to get up to. Also, nearby were a couple of pretty good sized drainage ditches...good for jumping across and \"barely\" making the edge. \n\nNever broke anything, but just never thought I could make it look good. If I had cell phones recording me and such back then...maybe a different path would have happened!\n\nKudos to all the stunt workers out there!",

In a world where release schedules are tighter than OPs mum, getting the film out the door on time may mean more profit overall",

He went on to cast her as one of the leads in Death Proof, which was part of the Grindhouse series. I remember the movies weren't terribly well received, but I loved Death Proof because of its slow build to the climax, the female forward cast, and real stunts. They strap Zo\u00eb Bell to the hood of a car that Rosario Dawson is driving while Kurt Russel tries to run them down in like a 15-20min long sequence, it's pretty cool.",

If the Star gets hurt or killed, there goes the entire movie or even an entire franchise, and with it hundreds of people\u2019s pay for that film. Stunt doubles take the risk so that actors don\u2019t end up completely tanking a multimillion dollar endeavor because they broke a leg. \n\nTom cruise always brags about doing his own stunts but how many best boys, PA\u2019s, effects techs, and other back end production associates would suddenly not have an income or have to scrabble to get on a different project if the mission impossible series just ended in the middle of filming? \n\nStunt doubles keep those franchises alive.\n\nNow. They deserve WAY better pay than they gets WAY better. But I truly think the separation there is necessary to preserve the film institution. It also gives people who are good at one but not the other a job.",

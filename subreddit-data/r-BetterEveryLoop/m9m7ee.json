Now like four years later, they only ever have praises to give for my shiba, and say that she\u2019s the best behaved one they\u2019ve ever cared for. That came from spending tons of time cuddling her as a pup, and getting her used to the \u201csubmissive\u201d postures for being handled at the vet and such, and I was also able to train her to sit and shake for treats. That was the farthest I got with her, but I\u2019m positive if I put in even more time, I could work with her to do even more!",

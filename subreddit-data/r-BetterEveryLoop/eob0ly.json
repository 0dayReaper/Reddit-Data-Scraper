And out pops a cookie. You're a little hesitant as it's a random pop up cookie, but you decide to give it a go. And it is FUCKING DELICIOUS. It's the best damn cookie you've ever tasted. And before you know it, the cookie is gone. So you rush over to the button and press it again. Only this time a bird flies over and shits on you. So you press it again. And again, a bird flies over and shits on you. And you press it and press it and bird, bird, bird. Come to find out, 99 out of 100 times you press this button, a bird will fly over and shit on you. And 1 out of those 100 times, out pops the cookie. And you realise that this cookie is so unbelievable good, that you're willing to get shit on 99 times in order to get that one cookie.\n\n....and then, one day, the cookie stops coming.\"",

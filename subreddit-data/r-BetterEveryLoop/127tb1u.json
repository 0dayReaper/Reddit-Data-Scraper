Presumably the person filming and the two bucket-men. That's why they are in shot. That's why they're walking close to each other. The video is short because we don't need to see minutes of set up and planning so they were edited out: we saw the important part. \n\nIn fairness I also don't know but I'm pretty confident that the prank was discussed and planned and either performed on anyone walking down that stretch of road that day and we only saw one success (there may have been many fails or whoever uploaded this only showed one of them) or they intended to prank that one guy who they knew would be there.",

In my comment, I was just agreeing with the comment above me about calling it fake so confidently. There\u2019s room for skepticism. Maybe I didn\u2019t make my view explicit. I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s a prank which is why they are filming. It\u2019s possible though that the boy in the cap is having a genuine reaction, probably not but possibly. Given that prank videos are all the rage these days it\u2019s hard not to consider it scripted, but I\u2019m open minded because it doesn\u2019t cost me anything.",

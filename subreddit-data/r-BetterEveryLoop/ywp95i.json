It is not so much disrespectful, as it is more seen as \"avoiding the fight\" which could be seen as shameful for a higher ranked Rikishi (Sumo Wrestler).\nAlthough it depends on how you spin it, it can be seen as well as a lecture to the hot headed youngsters, who carelessly charge, or as an intelligent move by a more experienced Rikishi. In any case it is always an opportunity for a debate on the legitimacy of that move. \n\nSearch Henka on r/sumo for more information.",

I think he caught a lot of shit for being a foreigner in a traditional Japanese sport. Sumo is also kinda a closed rank sport, they have to maintain a certain record to stay in the big leagues and the big leaguers will often lose matches in such a way that no one falls off and thus no one new can rise up. \n\nIt's a fascinating sport, an entire life dedicated to a few matches that can last less than a minute.",

But compared to a more familiar sport where guys will usually play for 15-20 minutes then swap out for a while and swap back in, it just seems so brief that you wait for months then your whole competition can be done in less than 20 minutes just seems so odd. Comparing the amount of minutes or hours a sumo will wrestle vs how many minutes a basketballer will play in his career is crazy.

It takes visual inputs from a sensor or camera and computes the best way to complete its mission while taking into account those inputs. For example, if the robot sees something coming toward it fast, it could be programmed to react by moving out of the way. It could also be programmed to just attack anything that registers as another robot. What you see in this video is probably this scenario: robot A was programmed to preemptively move out of the way, and presumably programmed to respond in case that didn\u2019t work. Robot B was probably programmed to immediately go forward to make contact with the other robot, which would then trigger subsequent actions depending on the response. Robot B was programmed lazily.",

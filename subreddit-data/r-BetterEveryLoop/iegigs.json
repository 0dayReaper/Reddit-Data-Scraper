For instance, as far as I understand all languages have vowels, and all languages have (at least some) pronouns. These are unifying elements that all human languages have. There are pushbacks against Universal Grammar, but most people agree that across all of human language there are universalities that every language has in common. Gorilla communication cannot or at least does not currently contain these universalities (Gorillas can't produce vowels, for instance). If gorilla communication were to emerge as a fully fleshed out language with syntactical and phonological rules, it's possible it could have universalities unique to all gorillas that are completely different from human universals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that is why in a linguistics sense \"language\" refers to all the varieties of *human* language. If gorillas or other animals have communication systems, we *shouldn't* try to lump them in with *human* language. Koko's system of communication, even if it was considered a language and became taught by Koko to other gorillas, would best be considered something unique to gorillas. It's like if we found life on another planet; would we try to lump whatever life was there into our existing taxonomic structures? I don't think so (admittedly I don't know). We probably wouldn't try to put animal-like creatures from an alien planet into the kingdom of animals; we'd probably consider it a whole separate thing entirely, unless we could prove it belonged to one of our existing domains.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn other words, trying to lump gorillas into the umbrella of human language is not a good idea, because if other animal languages do exist, they would have their own rules and restrictions in ways that human languages do not, just as human languages have rules and restrictions that Koko does not follow. Trying to apply human rules to other species is not helpful in that regard.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t get how it\u2019s fucking legal to keep animals this (whales, dolphins....) intelligent in a fucking cage so people can walk in and gawk at them through 8 inch glass.   Hopefully in 50 years we\u2019re going to look back at this like we look back at 1906 when we had pygmies in the Bronx zoo.   Smh it\u2019s a sad world we live in,  everyone just needs to learn respect for life in general,  politicians and cops  need to respect  the people they supposedly serve,  the entire world needs to respect the earth,  it\u2019s our home and most country\u2019s dump their waste (sometimes radioactive) into the ocean.  By 2050 their is expected to be more plastic in the ocean than fish.    Sorry for going on a rant there\u2019s just a giant fish kill going on where I live (the water is so contaminated that every single thing that used to live in it is floating on the surface) and it\u2019s  fucking with me cuz even the people that live around me don\u2019t are or don\u2019t give a shit.",

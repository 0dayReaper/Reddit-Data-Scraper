                                    "comment": "Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\n\nTldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.",

They have one of the strong bite force out of any speice of bears, that allows them to shred thru bamboo. They have adapted to eat bamboo, and it makes perfect sense for them to do so as well. Not many animals can consume bamboo as a food source so there is very little competition. When you think about the meaning of life, the pursuit of energy, building that energy  within one self then reproducing to pass off ones genetics. Every living thing does this, from microphages, to trees, to large animals. We all spend our time eating and building up a storage of energy, then we reproduce. Trees does that by taking in sunlight, water and minerals, they get big then produces seeds, bacteria eat too, they get bigger then divides, a panda also follows the blueprint of life, they eat bamboo, get fat, and mates to reproduce. There is nothing wrong with a panda, its adapated to a nieche enviroment, but its no more or less flaw in its evolution then say a human.",

Here's my rationalization, though: I want to know as much as I can, and be able to defend all of the things I think are true. \n\nWith that as my goal, it makes sense to take a position and jump into an argument/debate. Maybe I'll end up being wrong, that's ok, in the long run I'll get better and better and be wrong less and less and yea, the personal payoff for that is that I get to feel smart. But I feel like I'm earning it. \n\nThe key, I think, is that you have to be willing to be wrong. Jumping into debates with the best you've got at the moment doesn't help you if you're unwilling to adopt a stronger position when it comes around and crushes your ego. And I further think that we should be encouraging people to take this attitude even when it results in a lot of emotional debates because, at the end of the day, finding the best positions and the best arguments for positions helps all of us to optimize our lives for whatever outcomes we seek.",

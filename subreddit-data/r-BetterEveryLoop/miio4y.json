My dog was freaking out for several days back in September and I couldn't figure out why, something in our backyard. I kept going out there with her but couldn't see or hear anything, until one day I heard mewling coming from under my house. I ended up opening up the hatch in a closet to go down there and pulled out 4 kittens, just shy of a month old. They were a bit underweight and not on solid foods yet, but very hungry. I wasn't sure what had happened to the mom (I later realized the guy who cut my lawn blocked a meshed vent that had fallen down in the front that I missed, unknown to me or him that he cut off the kittens from their mom) \n\nThere were 3 tortoiseshell girls and one orange tabby. I kept them all for about a month until I had them weened and dewormed, then adopted out the tortoiseshells to friends of my sister, kept the tabby, and he's been great ever since. Bit more codependent than most cats, but I'm assuming that's because he was so young when I adopted him. \n\nMy dog, a big old pit mix was terrified of him for the longest time. Wouldn't even look at him for a month. Now they sleep and play and she chases any other cats out of the yard if he's playing. Big bruiser bodyguard.",

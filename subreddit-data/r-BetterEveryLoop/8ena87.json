Another time these people watched this person go flying up in the air in an alleyway (they were secretly propelled by a harness and rope wires).\n\nThat's legit terror. One moment you may not believe in that stuff. The next moment, you're watching it happen.\n\nIn Japan they take it further--one dude thought everyone around him was being shot by a sniper from another building. Like wtf how is that okay!?\n\nEven OP's prank is... well, probably harmless. But in the moment you are taking what could be a fragile mind and just absolutely shattering it. I wonder what the brain goes through in those moments and if they're honestly neutral events. Or if the trauma \"disappears\" as soon as you \"recorrect\" your reality by the camera crew coming out and telling you it was just a prank bro.\n\nIdk how I should feel about this stuff on any level. Whether it's innocent like OP's gif, or extreme like the Japanese pranks.",

Fucking, back like 8 years ago they had their bullshit, and it worked like Iplayer and was okay, had no problem.\n\n\nthen they started adding adverts, now these adverts were more spaced than TV so less of a problem , fair play ,they have to make money. However, they then added more adverts, every fucking 5-10 mins, what is this? fucking america?! even worse! the fucking adverts would have to reload multiple times if your internet wasn't perfect, sometimes leaving you in a loop of adverts, then your video would either forget its place or fuck up entirely. \n\n\nI beared with this bollocks for too long. I finally got an adblocker, then a few months on they blocked the adblocker and had even ore intrusive ads, where instead of a single advert you instead were physically forced to watch 5 minutes of fucking adverts whenever you got hit by their ad breaks, and they still had not fixed the fucking ad refresh issue so somethings you had to watch this 5 mins of ads numerous times, whether your connection fucked up or the ad server fucked up. Absolute piss take! fucking 10-20 mins of ads sometimes (i was often cooking or doing something else not staring at the screen like a muppet but still). \n\n\nSo yeah, at this point, it was a pile of wank, and i would just watch any other serve like netflix or youtube, very rarely opting for a few select things. \n\n\nThe final fucking straw was when they demanded that you made a fucking user account with them before you could watch shit, and had to jump through countless hoops. At that point I thought \"fuck it and fuck these cunts\" and just went off to search the show i wanted (I think it was black mirror or kitchen nightmares or something) and almost instantly had my result in ultra hd without god knows how long of adverts \n\n\n\nBut fuck me. If any company in the world failed at comprehending how you prevent piracy or people going elsewhere, it has to be channel 4, they are the most tech illiterate company of them all. \n\n\nThe BBC asking for a license number? Fair play, i get the hype and the need, also for how i can't watch bbc international (they can't show us adverts) \n\nBut fucking channel 4 needing me to login to watch a fucking 50 minute show with at least a half hour of adverts if not far more? they can bugger right off, find the largest and pointiest stick in all of Norfolk and rightfully go fuck themselves. \n\n\n\nFucking pricks. \n\n\n\nSorry about the rant but Channel 4 piss me off more than probably any other tv channel.",

Essentially, your brain simplifies a lot of the input it receives and is terrible at detecting drastic changes when its focus is diverted (like to the map).\n\nYou can watch a bunch of these \"person swap\" experiments online. I've seen a bunch of comments saying that they just edit out the people who notice and thats definitely true but you'd be surprised at just how easy this is to pull off and how many people don't notice the change. \n\nI did it quite easily with some classmates for a psych project and the vast majority of people didn't notice at all. We used two guys of different race/ ethnicity that weren't dressed alike, but the experiment can be replicated with a guy and a girl that look very different or whatever other differences. People generally only noticed when we fumbled and fucked up the swap. Interviewed them after telling that they had spoken to two different people and they were mind blown lol",

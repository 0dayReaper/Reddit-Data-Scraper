If a team can have more than one entrant at a weight class (as implied here), it's probably an Open tournament. That means the brackets can be large. So you gain a significant advantage by being able to rest during one match instead of having to expend the energy. \n\n\nI've thrown a match in wrestling before. There were two round-robin pools, and with my second-to-last match in my pool, I secured the first-place spot. So for my lat match in the pool, I barely did anything, just conserved energy (I was not going to allow myself to be pinned, however). Then 3 hours later in the championship match, I was fresh, and won with a 3rd round pin against an opponent who REALLY shouldn't have been pinned, he was just out of gas, mostly just laying there.",

The team score was close, and I was a slight favorite so we needed the points. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t having it, nor could I have it. I tried for a high crotch and completely missed his leg since I was seeing 3\u2019s. Just gave up after that.\n\nDidn\u2019t get pinned tho, fuck that,",

At the Last tournament of my junior year, the regional, the top 4 qualify for state. I lost a match I needed to win, and was then set to wrestle in the 5th / 6th place match... against the same guy in in the match I described above. \n\nThe problem was, if you got 5th place in the regional, you still had to train for 2 more weeks so you could be an alternate in the state trourney in case someone from your regional got sick or hurt. And I didn't fucking want to do that. So that 5th/6th place match I DEFINITELY wanted to lose. \n\nSo I wrestled this guy twice in my career, and the first time (end of junior year) I DEFINETELY wanted to lose, the second time (start of senior year) I didn't care if I won.  Which sucks, because I'd hate to leave him with the thought that he was a better wrestler than me.",

I wasn't used to quick, lanky opponents. Biggest embarrassment of my 'career'.\n\nI wound up beating him to go to the 3rd/4th place match at regionals (Best of 2/3!), thus qualifying for state. It was like a really crappy movie. I remember I was only up by two and he had a chance to reverse me with like 3 seconds left. I borderline threw him as the buzzer sounded so I wouldn't have to go to overtime against a better conditioned opponent.\n\nI'm not sure why I'm typing this, but your post made me reminisce. We all lose to people we think we should beat. 13 years later my old teammates still give me shit about it.\n\nEdit: Hadn't to Have",

I still remember how to skate too, having not done it for ages.\n\nI believe now there are programs and non-profits that are out there to try and get more kids into activities like this. Maybe these were available when I was younger, but my family might not have realised or had the time. I may be an outlier in the grand scheme of everything and maybe it is the case that it's plenty more accessible now than it was before, or it is for other places. Guess I may not find out until I have kids of my own and try and get them into their interests.",

My parents probably spent about 2,000-5,000$ a season growing up on, travel, skates, sticks (8-12 sticks a year) pads, gloves, hotels. I\u2019ve always said if I win the lottery ( only buy one ticket a year lol) id donate half just to make Hockey free for anyone that wanted to play. I couldn\u2019t imagine how much better our National team would be if we started stealing athletes at a young age from playing football and basketball and had them play hockey instead. There\u2019s nothing like the energy to from the game, it\u2019s like a literal war on ice, and everyone on your team is your brother and you\u2019d fight for them the same as they would you. My 4 closest friends are all from Hockey when we were 4-5 years old playing together until it was time to go off to college. Hockey is a lifestyle, not a sport.",

Hockey is a sport about brute toughness and all out war and never showing any weakness so it breeds a lot of hatred too. Agreed though, soccer is beautiful when played right. I\u2019ve watched plenty of compilations of soccer players weaving through a defense and doing what we in hockey would call \u201cdangles\u201d and breaking defenders ankles. What gets me is the shots they take and how the ball can bend, those are my favorite ones.",

I miss doing it. Disregard this if you weren't interested in this much feedback. LOL  \n\n\nSpiritbox - I can't really get into metal with female screamers. I've had many bands recommended and I can always tell that there's \"no balls\" as I say. Hahaha... Maybe it's cuz I'm a girl, but I dunno. Just not for me. I like my growls and screams to have balls. But fuck are those girls all talented. I sure as shit couldn't growl or scream like that. I've tried.  \nArchitects - I can appreciate the elements of this, but it's like the pop music of the metal world. Lots of good elements are there, but sounds really manufactured.   \nPolyphia - I already know this one cuz of my ex. I appreciate their technical skill but can't just sit and listen to them.   \nDistant Dream - This was my fav of your recommendations and I will definitely listen to more of this.  \nBad Omens - This one is also a little too manufactured for my tastes, but I kinda liked how they dip a little too far in melodic genres.   \nAtomship - I used to listen to quite a bit that sound like this band. As soon as it started playing I could tell the era it came from. I dunno if I'd get into them cuz they just remind me of bands I like better from that era. LOL But a solid pick.  \nJinjer - My ex introduced me to them. Couldn't get into them probably for the same reason as Spiritbox.  \nWage War - So while I do enjoy a decent amount of post-hardcore/metalcore stuff, these guys have a sound that makes me think they came a little late to the scene. Not quite as fresh sounding as say August Burns Red.  \nPlini - Another my ex introduced me to. I don't love when things get too djenty, but I can dig these guys since they don't, despite having some djent elements. I'd say my second fav on the list.",

I actually discovered them relatively recently. I do see them as not quite manufactured, but maybe... deliberate is the right word? Like it's not purely organic music writing, but writing with intent for financial success. I've known plenty of talented musicians (and not so talented musicians) who write good music like this, so it's not always a bad thing, just a little insincere I guess. But they seem to know exactly what they're doing and have enough real talent to keep that from being glaring and overwhelming. I tend to shy away from stuff that gets a little too emo in the post-hardcore genre, but these guys kinda get a pass. So far. LOL  \nErra - I hadn't ever heard of this band before, but I straight up just like them. They sound like they've borrowed from a lot of genres, some of the elements are little dated, but they still make it kind of new. Which I appreciate. I looked them up and the genre says \"progressive metalcore\". I love making fun of genres cuz there's so fucking many, but if there was ever a genre that I would guess I'd like the music just based on the genre, prog metalcore would be a good one for me. Looks like that genre is also attributed to ABR and BTBAM, which are bands I really like so that tracks.  \nIntervals - I have no problem with this. If someone wanted to listen to this around me, I'd never be like \"fucking shut it off!\" That being said, I can't say that I'd choose to listen to it, and if I was to take a stab at why I think it's because it does seem like in general I don't like when one instrument is really dominant. And this is quite guitar-centric.  \nPeriphery - I was already introduced to them and it's funny cuz there's elements that I'm like, well I should like this, but I never seem to feel like I wanna keep listening. I think maybe too djenty. I appreciate the more mathcore sounding bits, but then it gets too djenty I think, and I'm just taken out of what I like about it.   \nFit for a King - These guys remind me of Demon Hunter (a band I technically like but don't really listen to anymore because of negative associations with the music), which I guess is fitting because it says they're \"Christian metal\" which is just an unfortunate genre really. And I say that as a Christian. LOL But it feels a little soulless to me and I'm not really digging it.  \nShadow of Intent - Against all logic and reason.... I think I like this? Let me explain. LOL I don't like cookie monster vocals. I don't like black metal screechy vocals. I don't like the \"epic death metal\" that has a lot of keys. I don't like when blast beats are kind of hollow. This has all of those things. And there are definitely parts where my brain goes \"oh I don't like that bit\" but... I keep listening. And I think I'm enjoying it overall? LOL There is something that reminds me of Euro metal I was into in the mid 2000s I think. To be fair, I only listened to Elegy, so I don't know how I feel about all their stuff, and I don't know how often I'd choose it to listen to, but I enjoyed Elegy. Solid pick.\n\nShould I offer up fodder for you? I have no idea what else you listen to besides metal, how extensive your listening library is, how old you are, etc so I have no idea what to offer up. I might just give you a bunch of bands you already know. LOL",

So far what I can understand of our differing tastes is that I do like the djentier stuff. I am really digging Lorna Shore recently. What can I say, but a sucker for a breakdown. The vocal end is where I get picky and I can't seem to explain it. Especially with liking Lorna Shore. Thay band took what I thought I knew I liked and flipped it upside down. But that does lend me to more instrumental stuff. I am open to new opportunities to challenge my perception and redefine my taste.",

LOL I like breakdowns too, but sometimes they can sound too contrived. I mean, my fav band is still probably Deftones and there's lots of \"breakdown\" moments in Deftones songs. Dillinger Escape Plan is another fav. Here's a list of bands I assume you already know, but just in case: HORSE the Band, Rings of Saturn, Archspire, Revocation, Beyond Creation, Black Crown Initiate, Gojira, Gorod, Meshuggah, August Burns Red, Between the Buried and Me, Twelve Foot Ninja, Nekrogoblikon (they're fun). Not all of those are bands I like, but are bands you might like, and none of them are bands I dislike. Let me know if any of them are bands you don't already know, just out of curiosity.",

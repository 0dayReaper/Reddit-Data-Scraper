Repeat for as many turns. So while their body is moving smoothly, their head kinda does a stop-start movement.\n\nThat said, advanced skaters and this guy seem able to handle just giving 'er.\n\nMore detail on [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-don-t-figure-skaters-get-dizzy-when-they-spin/).",

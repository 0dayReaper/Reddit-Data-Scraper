In short-a phenomenon where insanely huge wave can form seemingly out of nowhere and be MANY MANY times bigger than any forecast prediction can anticipate.\n\nThe worst thing about the above- MOST of the ships are underengineered to handle the actual biggest waves possible and break as it is foceded to balance all of its weight on a small section.\n\nAll this means that sea transportation is never trully safe, although since recognition of rogue waves we can now finally know where they are more likely and reduce the risks somewhat.\n\nEDIT: Typo the kind redditor is making fun of below :D",

You can have little feeder vessels that are like 100 feet and you can have the gigantic E class vessels that are 1300ft (397.7m).\n\nI am a Bridge Officer currently on a 1000ft cargo ship with an aft house and my bridge (the deck that the video is probably filming from) is 120 ft up from the waterline. We just got out of a storm with about 15-20 foot seas and gale force winds very similar to the seas that you see in this video. Larger vessels like mine are built to handle waves like these and while the rolling was uncomfortable for a few days, none of us were ever really worried about the ship fracturing due to the waves. Little boats like the shit you see in Deadliest Catch and little yachts would absolutely get crushed by shit like this.\n\nAdditionally, rogue waves are not uncommon at all. The definition of a rogue wave is wave that is twice or more the height of a normal wave. So if you're experiencing 5-6 foot seas and you get a random 12-14 footer, that would be considered a rogue wave. This video the seas look to be about 25-30ish feet and the ship went straight into the trough of the wave, causing all the spray.",

Sometimes stuff in my cabin is making a lot of creaking sounds, the worst is when I have to hunt down something that is banging around INSIDE a drawer &amp; make it stop. I usually have to sleep in this weird figure 4 position on my stomach to stop from moving around as much. Sometimes if it's bad enough, I'll put my lifejacket under one side of my bed so that one side is raised and I can sleep pinned against the wall and my bed. But after a few days, everyone onboard is just exhausted and you just have to get sleep where you can get it.\n\nBut I'm currently sailing as the ship's navigator, so the captain and I are really the two who could spit out a weather forecast at any moment. There's a concept called \"stress conditioning\"--I've been doing this long enough now that there are few things that really stress me out enough to keep me awake, especially since I'm standing watches and I'm pretty much tired all the time. \n\nAlso I've been cheating this hitch and taking diphenhydramine sleeping pills on the nights where I don't expect to fall asleep very soon haha",

Capsizing in a storm is usually due to loss of propulsion, taking waves beam-on, loss of watertight integrity due to down flooding and subsequent loss of the vessel's ability to right itself, then you capsize. \n\nEvery ship's stability can be manipulated with ballast, cargo, fuel etc. There is a threshold of the ship's stability where it can roll to a certain degree from the vertical and the vessel WILL right itself. If you decrease that threshold due to something like a cargo hold being breached by water, the ship loses the ability to right itself. \n\nIn a super simple example, think of it like putting a plastic water bottle filled with air in a bathtub full of water. No matter how much you try to sink the bottle, it will always pop up back to the surface. That's your watertight integrity that allows the ship to remain above the water's edge. Now put a hole in the bottle and slowly let it fill with water.  That loss of watertight integrity is what would eventually lead to a capsizing and eventually sinking. \n\nI explained that extremely simply as ships are not one compartment bow to stern, but that's the basic concept of ship stability.\n\nSource: am a bridge officer onboard a 1000ft container ship right now.",

Half of the glass on the Bridge were blown out and the crew had to face those waves on the weather decks to replace them with plywood. They clipped into the railing in order not to be swept away. This was a drill ship and not exactly stable. She survived.",

            "comment": "A wave can only sustain a ratio of 7 to 1 of base to height before it breaks down. The longer the period, the distance crest to crest or trough to trough, the more engergy is in the system and the faster they are. Exceed the 7 to 1 and the base will outrun its top and break, for the most part, on the backside of the wave not the front and energy will be dissipated. Swells not waves have the most energy.\n\nWhen a wave or swell pushes into the shore and the friction of the shallows slows the base of the wave, then the wave will topple forward to the joy of the surfers. This does not occur in the open sea unless another force acts upon it. \n\nThe swells were faster than the ship I was on. The swells were longer easily than the ship I was on. Swells, not waves would lift our screws out if the water and the whole ship would tremble. Don\u2019t get me wrong the big waves would toss us too but a 30 foot wave was nothing to us. We were a geological drill ship and we stayed motionless on one location weeks at a time. 30 foot waves in transit can give the ship a motion where it can be quite uncomfortable. \n\nStorms and winds make waves. The longer a wind of a certain velocity is allowed to blow over the surface of a body of water, the higher the waves will be and this is limited by velocity of the wind and time the wind is allowed to put its energy into the wave. The behavior of a wave will give you an indication of the wind energy creating it. The Beaufort  scale is a chart showing wave behavior and wind speed. Pretty darn neat.\n\nSwells are formed by areas of disturbed seas caused by massive storms. The high energy being injected into the seas by storms, like a hurricane or Typhoon escapes the area first and forms swells. This swells can proceed the storm by hundred of miles. The swell can be massive and very fast. Easily We we\u2019re in the Gulf of Mexico prior to Hurricane Katrina. A few lessor Hurricanes formed and dissipated in Mexico far enough away they were not an issue. Our sea state was like glass. It was hot and not a breath of air the the swells came. Now imagine sand dunes made of glass as far as you can see. It was a magical sight to behold. The swells were generated from a major storm 700 miles away. \n\nUnfortunately there are times when the wind direction and the fetch ( distance between land masses which can disrupt the wind) allows waves to build and it meets something like the Gulf Stream which can put additional energy into the whole system and the waves will grow to a monstrous height. \n\nStrong currents live at the points of great land masses such as the tip of Africa and the tip of South America. Our \u201cHorns\u201d are infamous for their furious seas. Less so off the coast of Greenland and Newfoundland but the movie the \u201cPerfect Storm,\u201d in the area of the Grand Banks. \n\nCrossing to Antarctica is also rough as this is the longest fetch. If you look at a globe, you can see there is no landmass to disrupt the circumpolar current which lies off the coast of our frozen continent. The roaring 50\u2019s is a real thing be it referring to latitudes South or North.\n\nNow this next fact about waves will make your head hurt. Are you ready? The wave molecules don\u2019t really move. They will circle and come right back,almost, to where they started. What moves is energy. This little fact caused me to stare at the ocean for hours the 15 years I was at sea. \n\nWaves are the worlds largest \u201cSlinky\u2019s.\u201d That energy can and will kick ones ass. Birds don\u2019t care. They bob on the surface or use the energy to soar above them. It is deadly to humans but for them it\u2019s a  birds playground. \n\nSince I was on a research vessel, I has access to an extensive scientific library with volumes on wave behavior and it tried to ingest all which I could comprehend. The math threw me but the overall concept and conclusions stuck. Water is fascinating in general but that is another topic entirely.",

When sailing in rough seas we always run dead downwind of a storm because it\u2019s the safest, if not white-knuckled, way to handle it. Seems like on a massive ship like this beating into it would be a huge spend of fuel. \n\nAlso, why does this video keep getting stretched vertically?",

It can only realistically take large waves in one direction, heading into them as that\u2019s what the bow is designed for. \n\nIt gets stretched vertically because it makes it seem more dramatic. Look forward to three months from now when the wave looks ten feet taller",

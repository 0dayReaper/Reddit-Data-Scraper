The video is mesmerizing me in this way and I happy to watch it many times. This is a video can't be watched everyday and everyone should loves it too.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

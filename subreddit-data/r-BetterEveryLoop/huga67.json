It gets more funny the longer you watch. Also after watching a few more times, I noticed the person in the back doing a crappy version of the sprinkler.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

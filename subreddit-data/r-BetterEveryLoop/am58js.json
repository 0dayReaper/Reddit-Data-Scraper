A hug from an older brother to another.\n\nHaving lost so many at such young ages, there is one thing I've learned that holds true in every important loss I've suffered: You will never be the same.\n\nI was my father and mothers son. I still am, but the meaning of that is different now that they are no longer alive. You will always be your younger brother's older brother, but it will mean something different when he is gone.\n\nWhen someone told me that I wouldn't be the same years ago it hit me like a ton of bricks. Months after my father had died a few days after I moved back in to take care of him, I was finding myself searching for that old comfortable feeling I had known while I thought of myself as \"my fathers son\", with all of the expectations and perceptions that entails. For us those feelings will not come again, never to be found in the form our heart desires.\n\nWhen you can't imagine pushing on, when you are lost trying to find yourself, do not look for the old you. They are gone. It will take time, but one day if you push through the pain you will find yourself deciding who you are going to be. When its rough and you're stuck not knowing what to do, don't merely ask yourself \"what should I do?\" Think about what a someone who is what or who you've decided to be would do, and do that. It's going to be OK, just different.\n\nIt always hurts, but the way the pain moves you changes as the years pass.\n\nI know what I just typed is painful to read,  I am so sorry that your brother is dying. You're going to make it through this. Cherish the time you have with him and say whatever you need to say. Leave nothing unsaid.\n\nWe're here for you bud. This should be obvious, but shoot me a message if you wanna chat.",

It actually made me smile through my tears.\n\nAt the clerk's office, after chatting a bit, the clerk said she thought butterflies were a sign that a deceased loved one was saying hello to you. She said, \"Keep a lookout for the butterflies\" as I left her office. As I pulled out of the parking lot, a butterfly floated past the front of my car. I'm also skeptical but that day, it felt comforting.",

As it nibbled the rice, it cocked its head this way and that, doing a passable imitation of intent listening to the weeping of the assembled family.

We heard the news, the following day, we see a big red breasted cardinal outside of our back window.  He was just hanging out there, after my parents and I were talking about my uncle and thinking about the times that we spent with. Keep in my mind we live In Wisconsin, and the temps are below freezing. We just look at each other and feel a little bit more comforted.\n\nThere literally has been multiple occurrences of cardinals just coming up to our back window and just looking inside of our house, or just flying around making their appearance known\n\nI\u2019m not super religious by any stretch of the imagination. As it could be a coincidence, it\u2019s comforting I guess. ",

The description on the Facebook post: \n\n&gt; This is amazing- so as many know my husband\u2019s grandmother Dorthy passed into glory two weeks ago.. (she was 97) \n\n&gt; For the past few years my mother-in-law Debbie and her sister Jeanne have talked to Grandma and on several occasions asked her (when it was her time to leave this world) send them a sign once she was in heaven, and they specifically asked that a cardinal would be involved. Aunt Jeanne also prayed that the Lord would do it in such a way that they would never have thought of. Well, God answered that prayer yesterday, (the day after grandmas memorial service, and hours after they had been talking about that very prayer) while they were playing grandmas favorite card game, \u201cCanasta\u201d!!!\n\n&gt; They heard something at the kitchen window and my father-in-law Brian went out to check. A cardinal was there and he was able to bring it inside. For 10 min they held and pet it, then they decided to go outside to release it. Following is a short video clip of this amazing experience and what happens next! (The bird flew away 10 min later) You must watch!! \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f\n\nCan\u2019t link to the post as per the sub\u2019s rules though and reddit's anti doxx policies.\n\n----\n\nShout out to u/vibrex for showing me this video earlier!

A man's wife died and soon after her yellow rose bush died. The next year, that dead yellow rose bush came back to life and bloomed red instead, the wife's favorite color. The man thought it was a sign, but in reality, the root stock of the plant was a different variety of rose than the yellow one that had been grafted onto it by the nursery. The yellow top part died but the root sent up new branches that expressed the original flower color.\n\nWhen I worked in a children's science museum, I told kids that \"Magic is just science you don't yet understand\"",

My mom was tidying up a few months later and went to put away a book on a bookshelf that was laying on top of the other books. She was flipping through the pages and a little heart shaped piece of notebook paper fell out that said \u201cI love you mom, love Stevie.\u201d You could tell by the handwriting that it was from when she was young; she always wrote little notes.\n\nTo make it even crazier, the little note was marking the page of a chapter titled \u201cHeroin.\u201d THEN my mom looked at the book and it was Stairway To Heaven... I\u2019m a skeptic as well but I have no explanation for this. It\u2019s simply divine and gives me chills. It\u2019s the first thing that happened after my sisters death that gave my mom hope.

A physical form of the person is gone, but the energy that made them who they were still exists somewhere.\n\nVideos like this, or when you suddenly find yourself reminiscing about a long lost family member, or getting a sudden feeling of comfort is, what I believe, to be the energy of a former family member or loved one interacting with you.\n\nPerhaps this cardinal chilling on a complete stranger with no aggression or fear is coincidental. But maybe it isn't.\n\nCall me a hippy if you want; but the idea that a person's energy still existing in this world comforts me. Because one day I'll be gone, but I'll still exist in some way.

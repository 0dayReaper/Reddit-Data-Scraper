We\u2019d pretend to be doing a tv special on the \u201cDabbit\u201d, sneak up on her, and then run away so she could chase us like in this video. She\u2019s now 17 with really bad arthritis. She can no longer rough house with us but gosh this video brings back so many good memories. Thanks for sharing OP.",

The real difference with big cats and housecats is just that their play can get dangerous. Most of the time big cats hurt their humans it's because they got carried away with play or even occasionally when they're trying to take care of their human. Siegfried's tiger was apparently dragging him behind the stage after he had a seizure/stroke according to him. The cat was trying to drag him like it would a baby tiger by the neck which with his old man skin just tore him up bad.\n\nThey're not the evil bloodthirsty creatures people make them out as. They're just huge and all 5 of their appendages end in knives. Oh shit they're Edward Scissorhands....",

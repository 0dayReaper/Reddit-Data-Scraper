I'd go as far as to say I was Damn Good.  But I wasn't a Real Athlete.  \n\nI was 17-0 going into a match against a dude who would go on to be an Olympic Alternate.  Never made the olympics for the US, but came close.  I knew what he was but was feeling pretty positive about myself.  I was undefeated too and had nothing to lose. I knew he was better than I was but you've always got a punchers chance right?\n\nSo I lock up.  In wrestling that means I put my hand on the back of his neck and my other on his elbow and he does the same to me.  When you lock up you pull on that neck or push on that elbow to see how the other person reacts.  Maybe they jerk their head back too much opening themselves up for a shot.  Point is when you tug they always give a little.\n\nNot this dude.  It felt like I was pulling on a granite statue.  Weirdest feeling ever.  I'd been wrestling for years at this point and this was the first time that EVER happened.  Dude just didn't even FEEL like another person.  \n\nI was outclassed more than I was as a total rookie going up against seniors.  It was one of the most humbling experiences I've ever gone through.  \n\nI finished the year with 2 losses.  Both to this dude.  Both just as humiliating.  It's these sort of things that make you realize that there's a ceiling to how far you can go.  NO amount of training would ever get me to that level.",

Then this sophomore transfer kid that matched up with me for practice kept beating me in every single match. I quit within a week after being very discouraged.

Kid was playing significant time as a freshman in 6A Florida state championship in 2001.\n\nBy his junior year going to games was watching 21 high school football players and a budding world class athlete on the field. He played every snap of every game, offense and defense. \n\nLed to a 10 year NFL career that wont put him in the HOF, but nobody can disrespect that he was an NFL level starting CB for a decade.",

Dude was an absolute beast, leaps and bounds beyond everyone else in HS.  He was a key part of every single play and I'm pretty sure they were undefeated that year.  His skills pale in comparison to Cromartie.\n\nMy opinion.... It takes both gifted athleticism and work ethic to make it to the elite levels.  (I think) you won't get there without both.  That said, there's some exceptions where average athleticism and extreme work ethic and mindset can make it happen. Disclaimer... I don't sportsball and don't know sheet.",

Yes, there's summer and fall training leagues for the serious kids, but they already know they want to play basketball by that point.\n\nBut since Soccer and Football are both fall sports, boys get encouraged to play football over soccer, whereas during the winter, a they could still play basketball too.\n\nAnd don't be so fast to think the US doesn't dig soccer super stars.  Remember David Beckham?  The US absolutely *adored* him because even when he played for Milan, Madrid, or ManU, he was a top player.  \n\nWhen he moved to the LA Galaxy - the public loved him, and turnout went way up.  \n\nFrom what I've learned though, it's not that US players stink - it's that they can't 'get good' here, they have to go to Europe to train in like Germany, but if they do become great, they don't tend to come back to the US.\n\nA big issue is the pay - US players don't earn squat.  So the greats stay in the clubs and teams in other countries where their chances of stardom and money are greater.",

It was a random genetic mutation \"dwarf gene\" and the only reason why the gene got popular is because the first ever munchkin kitty that was recorded (Blackberry 1980's) decided to mate with a lot of stray kitties. Are we to terminate this genetic mutation just because it doesnt look like its companions?  The dwarf gene does not cause any joint or back problems. They just have shorter bones in their legs. It's kinda cruel that you are discriminating dwarves just because they look different. Other genetic mutations in cats, such as being polydactyl or having a bobtail, does not seem to have a bad rep... There are some mutations in kitties that does cause harm however, such as the mutation of ears in Scottish Folds.",

As long as the nail bed isn\u2019t damaged, it\u2019ll grow back. You\u2019d have to remove the nail bed to stop fingernails from growing. \n\nSecond, cat claws aren\u2019t simply fingernails. In humans, fingernails and toenails are there to protect the end of the finger and last joint of bone. They aren\u2019t designed for actual clawing. In cats, they are specifically evolved for clawing. That means they need a strong attachment point, because that\u2019s basic physics. The attachment point must be able to withstand greater force than is applied to the scratching end, otherwise it would just pull loose. In cats, this attachment point is the last bone joint of their toes. You have to remove this joint to stop the claws from growing back. \n\nThis is going to surprise you, but cats aren\u2019t humans. I know you\u2019re on the right side here, but that doesn\u2019t excuse applying absolutely zero thought at all to the entire thing. The world would be a lot better place if we stop excusing intellectual laziness simply because it\u2019s happening on our side.",

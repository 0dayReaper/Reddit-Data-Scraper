It was the craziest thing and I saw it a number of times as we got to where we would stop. We figured she was a motorcycle rider in a past life, but knew it was just the tone of his exhaust that got her motor revving. I told him to buy her, but he didn't and she's gone now. It was fun to watch though.",

Also, there are plenty of species that are incredibly intelligent such as pigs whose intelligence matches that of a 3 year old human child. Orca whales have their own languages, accents and names for each other. Ants have passed the mirror test. \n\nI don't think there's a problem with anthromorphising animals, mainly because it doesn't harm anything and it may teach something to others who don't have any knowledge nor respect to animals that we live alongside. That's how animal abuse happens, by assuming they're stupid and 'beneath' the perpetrator, and I don't know about you but I would prefer to see less animal abuse.",

A fucking cow was standing in the middle of the intersection but this being gujarat, the policeman was scared to hit her to make her go away so he just tried to shoo her. In the meanwhile, 2 other cows started loitering around the place. A woman came and then fucking prayed (we call it aarti kari) and put tilak on the cow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll tell you what though this doesn't happen outside that state and BJP only made these cow people worse.",

They also all don't want to crash into you, or each other, and there becomes this sort of natural weaving ebb and flow to the traffic even though there is no semblance of order.\n\n Definitely requires more alertness than say, American Suburbia, but with the caveat that this alertness is required of everyone or it's certain death, and it somehow makes it less stressful of an experience than being run off the road unexpectedly by someone doing random things or being distracted when there is an expectation of normalcy.",

So once they the cows have passed their milk producing age they are left to roam free and they cannot be killed for meat of leather. In fact many states have banned cattle slaughter and consumption of cattle meat. So these cows in the urban and even rural areas roam free and cause havoc. Most of the time they are calm and don't attack humans unprovoked but can be be seen running around traffic and causing some issues.",

I don\u2019t really have an issue with it if you\u2019re not making a mockery of it or wearing it like a Halloween costume, profiting off it, or if it\u2019s got a sacred meaning, just feels disrespectful then. Most people of that culture who live in the country don\u2019t care and like to see it being celebrated by other people/westerners. Generally I\u2019ve just seen kids of immigrants and the diaspora communities having an issue, and they cite the double standard of being made fun of or excluded for their race or culture, but how the thing they\u2019re mocked for is now seen as cool or acceptable bc a (white) westerner started sporting it. Which I can sympathize with the hurt that comes from that but I think that\u2019s hardly ever the intent.",

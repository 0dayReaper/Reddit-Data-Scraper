No more *having to sit up in bed at all.* Just private viewing of media that takes up your whole FOV.\n\nEdit: Lol who knew so many would get upset over the idea of using VR as a 2D viewing device instead of 3D immersion.",

Projection distance for something like that is tricky, like real tricky. Most current solutions for desktop style stuff involve a \"screen\" you see in an abstract 3 dimensional space so as to not completely overwhelm your eyes and feel like you got your eyeball stuck to the desktop. The problem is that if you project the desktop on a screen that is small enough to emulate a good distance away from you the resolution isn't high enough to give you good enough detail, it becomes grainy and frankly feels like a downgrade from a monitor. \n\nFor movies its sort of a fake cinema and works better since it's not as resolution dependent as working with a PC is. \n\nFor Games you still need to change a lot in the game to accommodate a screen headset, to make sure you get immersed and don't get the eyeball to screen effect. Here you can really do great things and I really enjoy the space sim type games since you don't have any impulses to move around.",

The fact that they tracked my entire body without having to wear gloves or boots or anything is amazing. Being able to look down and see my arms in a storm trooper suit made me giddy. Also, battling Darth Vader was terrifying. Can\u2019t recommend it enough",

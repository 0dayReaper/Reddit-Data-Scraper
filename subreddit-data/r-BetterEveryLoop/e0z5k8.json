It only works when he\u2019s squared up to the camera. From\nthe side it looks ridiculous. Shoe lifts don\u2019t make you lean forward.",

The cadence, the posture, the final glare at the end. I laughed harder with each loop and hoped others would find it funny too.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it.

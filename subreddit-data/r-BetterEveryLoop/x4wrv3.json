Wheels are very common exercise tools for energetic breeds like Rexes and Bengals. \n\nCRexes have enough energy to need regular stimulation \u2014 I personally like to compare them to border collies. While they don\u2019t specifically need a job to do, they do need regular mental and physical stimulation, training, and exercise. Definitely not a standard house cat - they require lots of time and effort. It\u2019s why wheels like these are so common with Crex owners, you can just let them run off the neuroses instead of zooming through the house and literally bouncing off walls lol",

I got my One Fast Cat specifically for my younger, absolutely rambunctious 2 year old, Calliope... After initial attempts at training, she wants literally nothing to do with the wheel, but my 7 year old male who's more of a lap cat and sunbather LOVES it.  He stands near it to signify he wants me to come watch how cool he is, then he speedwalks on it while I watch because he presumably likes to show off.  You never know what cat may enjoy the wheel!  Energetic ones are just good bets, but sometimes they prefer playing with wands to running in place.  It's awesome enrichment if your cat shows interest.",

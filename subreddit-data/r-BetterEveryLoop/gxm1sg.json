This fighting technique is known as the righteous guiding hands of harmony, or something... and is only known to certain masters of an often believed to be an ancient forgotten discipline. I only know of this because I was told about this by an elder master I met once at a dive bar in New Orleans at 3am after I crapped out in the casino drunk and on various recreational pills and powders, who was on a spirit quest to find a worthy adversary capable of ending his life after a long tenure of storied victories. If this video was not slowed down, it would merely appear as a beautiful storming torrent of fists appearing in the shape of a brilliant sunburst.

If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

Technically challenging is a better way of describing it. It\u2019s a Category A airfield meaning only captains can land and take-off. It\u2019s very short and also unusually narrow making the runway seem further away than it is as well as creating various other issues.",

And there's still a jet blast danger because the pilots could decide that they don't like how they're lined up and decide to touch-and-go instead.\n\nEither way, the way people get hurt is when the wind knocks them off their feet, maybe fall off a seawall or something, and they hit a fragile body part against a hard ground part. The blast from engines isn't very toxic (similar to diesel exhaust) and it's not hot unless you get entirely *too* close, but it is violent.",

If that landing is your first memory of being on a plane, *everything* feels safe. Even landing at the old Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong, which was notoriously unsafe and they got rid of.",

What you listed are instrument approaches, to be used when the clouds form a layer above the runway (ceiling) that you need to get below before landing. Non-precision approaches will give you lateral guidance and a minimum altitude,  while a precision approach will give you lateral with a lower min alt as well as glideslope down. \n\nIf it's a clear day (VFR), it doesn't matter what approaches are available, you're taking over to land visually the moment you contact tower (factor traffic nonwithstanding).",

That would be an unnecessary pain for sequencing on a CAVU day.\n\nI'm reading SERA.8005(c) which explains that \"clearance for an IFR flight to execute a visual approach may be requested by a flight crew or initiated by the air traffic controller.\" I don't see any caveats in there fit for commercial flights. \n\nFor reference, I'm military, so I know little about commercial aviation, but I do take off IFR every single time without exception, and land VFR every time it's practical.",

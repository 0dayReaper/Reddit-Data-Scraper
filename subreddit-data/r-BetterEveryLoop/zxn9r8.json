It's a relaxing, portable hobby that lets you make warm yarn things for yourself or others. \n\nIt does take a lot of fine motor skills and repetition to get muscle memory established.  And try to pay attention to ergonomics as you learn -- repetitive stress injuries will sneak up on you and wreck your life. \n\nIf you give it a try, I don't recommend the usual beginner project of a plain garter stitch scarf (or any scarf, they're too long as a starter project). I'd suggest just making ~4\" squares and experimenting with new stitches and techniques. There's lots of ways to cast on and cast off (ie start and end knitting), plus even more ways to produce a variety of fabric (ribbing! Lace! Cables! Knit/purl patterns!  And more!). \n\nYouTube is great for learning techniques, ravelry is great for finding patterns (some controversy with this site but uh it's got a lot of patterns). \n\nActually, find a local yarn store and see if they have lessons or resources for beginners! Local yarn stores are usually lovely but struggling financially.  Plus they love to see new knitters!",

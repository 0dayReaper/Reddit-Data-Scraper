These bots are so heavy with all of the equipment, armor, and everything in them that actually ***weight-saving*** is *massively* important. This bot will easily sit above 250, maybe even 300 without the weight-saving mods and features. But, you want to be as close to 250 as possible, as that lets you have as much armor, reinforcement, weaponry as you can carry. If you don't weigh 250, that means you're starting at a disadvantage, because everyone else will be maxed out.\n\nSo, what makes it look fake? These bots are *fucking terrifyingly powerful*. The blue bot just flipped *250lbs like it was nothing. Twice.*\n\nEdit: OP made a much better response to a similar thought below mine. I'm going to grab some of their links.\n\n[This](https://battlebots.com/2021-season-robots/) is the list of bots for this season. They're actually quite big. Probably bigger than you think.",

If you want to defend against said weapons of such weight, you'll need strong armour and steel is heavy, especially if you want to armour yourself well.\n\nYou need a powerful drive, with motors, batteries, speed controllers, receivers\u2026 all of this adds up.\n\nThere is no ballast in these things. It's pointless to make it heavy just for the sake of making it heavy. You need progressively more powerful weapons and progressively thicker armour. In the old days, they'd use aluminum and weak weapons, but with the damage they can dish out now, it's become an arms race of sorts.\n\nLastly, you need to see these up close to really appreciate how big they are. If you look at the [team photos](https://battlebots.com/2021-season-robots/) where everyone is standing next to their machines, you can see the scale. Most people think these are like RC cars, but think about the size of an RC car compared to you putting your 2 feet together. Now look at these guys' feet for scale and it consider these robots are nearly all made of steel, have massive weapons, and complicated internals.\n\n**EDIT**: There are a LOT of comments arguing about this being fake and Big Dill not weighing anywhere near 250 lbs. I posted a thread on /r/battlebots about this to get a sense of the builders' take on the weight issue and how close everyone is to the 250 lb weight limit. Pretty much every verified builder says they are at or just a tad below that limit. [You can read that thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlebots/comments/y4h37x/builders_how_close_do_you_get_to_the_250_lb/).",

If you're in the US, you will likely find lower weight class competitions in your state. Attend a couple events first as it's great to learn from people at the events. And of course, it's not a good idea to jump to the 250 lb robots right away. They're dangerous, expensive, and a lot of work.\n\nIf you're interested or have questions, the community at /r/battlebots is a good place to read up and ask questions.",

I don't think there are superheavyweight competitions right now (superheavyweights are permitted to weigh up to 340 lbs), so at the moment, very few actively competing robots are above 250.\n\nThe one exception to this is if you have non-traditional locomotion. This basically means you drive around on things other than wheels/tank tracks. Walking robots are permitted to weigh twice as much \u2013 [Chomp was 500 lbs](https://battlebots.fandom.com/wiki/Chomp).",

Either way, toward the other persons comment it\u2019ll weigh pretty close to 250lb, they get as close as they can to that weight",

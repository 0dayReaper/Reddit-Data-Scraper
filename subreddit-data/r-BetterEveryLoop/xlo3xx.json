I've been going to concerts for a couple decades and adding a cord isn't going to let me hear any more range of a FLAC file, and I'd argue that's a similar statement for 99% of people who've been alive long enough to properly rough up their ears.",

[Random example](https://youtu.be/vWYgcgkreoI)\n\nMy father is a marine mechanic engineer and has been working on ocean liners. Ships are just a hobby for me tbh, but I really don't like this man's technique. If something unexpected happens to that boat that inflicts big forces on it, friction won't work on this one too well, since the rope on rope contact gives most of the friction. Also, these random directions of the line that he throws are making so none of the layers are actually held by other layers of rope properly.",

Those locks do their work great, the boat won't move, the problem is that it won't move when you want it to either as the locks will be close to impossible to remove if the knot ever endures any sort of tension.\n\nBased on my first hand experience of working at sea, both on smaller and larger ships, you never ever make those locks. The friction of the rope on itself is large enough to the point where the rope will break before the knot slips without any locks.\n\nIn the video it also seems like the first few turns of rope on the bollard is enough to both brake, and pull the vessel to the berth. And then the man in the video applies twice the amount of turns on the bollard. Effectively rendering your arguments about how the knot will not stand up to large forces as invalid as stopping a ship that size puts a lot of force on that rope.\n\nAlso, those are not random directions. When looking at it closer you can clearly see how the rope would pinch down onto itself if any sort of force were to be applied.",

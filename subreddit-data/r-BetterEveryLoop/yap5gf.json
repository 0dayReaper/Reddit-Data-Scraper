The problem is that dictatorships look impressive because they want you to pretend its impressive, usually the system crumbles because theyre all clawing for power unless if the emperor has made everyone that loyal. Think north korea but with nazi like wealth. Yhwach is basically the most powerful being in the story and hes smart so he has goons.",

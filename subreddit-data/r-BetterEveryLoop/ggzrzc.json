Jesus lol\n\n\nEDIT\n\nAfter checking out the gif a few more times I feel sorry for LilHulk. It saddens me because if you look closer it seems like he is just a victim of bullying. LilHulk doesn\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not his turn to blow out the candles, but all he sees is his dad blocking him from joining in the festivity all while the older brother gets to blow out the candles. LilHulks world is shattered by such cruelty. I looked it up on YouTube and it feels that way even more with the audio. LilHulk says it\u2019s not fair..\n\nSo I retract my judgement on poor LilHulk. At the end he is just a victim of bullying.",

This looks like attention motivated behaviour. By pulling the kid aside, you actually encourage this behaviour because you are reinforcing it. Basically, you are giving the child your full attention and taking it away from other children, so the kid \"learns\" that acting like a little asshole is a really effective way to get parents to stop giving attention to other children and focus solely on him (I put learn in quotes because it's a learned behaviour, but chances are the kid is not doing it consciously; using learned in the technical sense). You stop him from ruining the party, then ignore his tantrum. Later, you can give him some undivided attention when he is behaving appropriately. This puts the behaviour of \"being an asshole\" on what we call extinction (it is no longer rewarded, therefore does not meet the goal of the behaviour [attention]), while also encouraging appropriate behaviour by reinforcing it with the desired outcome.\n\nSource: I'm a child psychologist",

I know this has an impact because my son begins to visibly feel bad. He pouts and sometimes hugs into me and let\u2019s out small non-attention grabbing cries. I\u2019ll hug him back and tell him that his feelings of jealousy and wanting attention aren\u2019t abnormal but he should talk to me about it rather than let it ruin someone else\u2019s day. These days he\u2019s more likely to come to me and tell me that he \u201cfeels sad\u201d, and I\u2019ll try to address it. I hope this way works anyway... I am concerned that getting him to open up about how he feels could make him look vulnerable to bullies, though.",

Kids that expect to get a loving lecture every single time they don't get their way are not taught how to deal with disappointment. They aren't taught that no means no. They aren't taught to respect boundaries.\n\nThat's what this looks like.\n\nI got a consequence every single time I violated a boundary my folks laid down, and it was immediate. I have ADHD and I would NEVER have acted like him. My mom would have told me to sit still and stop once, and I would have stopped.\n\nPeriod.\n\nMy nieces and nephews are all little hell-raisers (good kids all, just energetic honestly), and yet with me it's amazing how I just need to tell them to do something once.\n\nJust once.\n\nBecause I have always consistently enforced boundaries with consequences, immediately. In ways that make the kids disappointed. And the kids LOVE to spend time with me, beg for my attention, and are excited every time we hang out.\n\nAnd not just my 3 nephews and 6 nieces - but also my friends kids, and it was true when I used to run a daycare. Kids love me, and they listen because when I say it's time to listen, I mean it, and when it's time to play, I mean it, and there are clear consequences for acting like I don't.\n\nYou don't always have time to take a kid aside to help them understand. Sometimes they just need to listen now because you told them to.\n\nBecause boundaries save lives.\n\nMy friend's daughter is another example of a kid that loved spending time with me, and would listen to me because I was \"strict\". Her grandmother thought I was TOO strict.\n\nI was asked to take a road-trip with both the grandma and the daughter, basically drive them home for my friend, which I agreed to. My friend trusted me to make sure they were both safe, and the little girl just didn't listen to grandma.\n\nWell, sure enough she complained about how strict I was, but her son had made it clear that I was in charge. But she made little complaints, kids will be kids, etc. We would take stops at gas stations, and the grandma would go off with the daughter into a safe clearing area and let her run around, which was a fine idea to have the kids burn off some energy.\n\nBut then at one stop she ran towards the gas pumps as a semi truck was pulling in, and as the grandma screamed in panic for her to stop, she was as usual, ignored.\n\nI yelled the girls name once, told her to stop from across a much larger distance and she stopped on a dime as I told her to come straight to me (the angle was such that if she had kept running the truck wouldn't have seen her, but where she was running to me was safe).\n\nThe grandmother was shaken of course and wanted to chastise the little girl for listening, and I pointed out to her that this is what SHE taught her. Without consistent consequences, you teach kids they don't have to listen. You teach them they can argue and negotiate before they are old enough to know when that is appropriate.\n\nBut when kids learn disappointment, they learn to LISTEN FIRST - before they start asking questions.",

The kid being blocked looks like he's pissed his little brother got a cake and candles and he is gonna blow out candles too come hell or high water. The parent using the plate to block the kid is not doing it to be mean to the angry child, he's doing it because the littlest one is the one who gets to blow out the candles on his cake for his birthday and when the angry kids birthday comes back around the parents will probably not let the little one blow out all the candles on his brother's cake since it's mean to do that to someone.\n\nMiddle kids melt down at the end is really funny even though I know the kid is super frustrated and probably jealous and doesn't know how to deal with that, and hopefully this will be a funny family video when he gets older.",

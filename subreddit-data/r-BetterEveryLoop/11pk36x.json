He finishes a successful run to home base with a tasty little spin to class up the whole play. Quality from beginning to end. \n&gt;\n&gt;The spin is done incredibly athletically and with grace and ease, making it also look very casual and nonchalant. The player is clearly skilled.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

You wear sliding shorts with padding to help with bruising, but you get really good at the weight distribution, and once you're playing competitive baseball, you're able to pop up on a dime because of how controlled the entire movement is. This guy's ability is just super efficient and smooth, he probably barely feels his slides. Maybe not good long term still, but that's how most athletic stuff goes.",

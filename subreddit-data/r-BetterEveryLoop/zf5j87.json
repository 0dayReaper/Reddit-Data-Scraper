Someone else here pointed out that the background video itself that it is rendered on top of is likely in reverse because of the item seemingly flying on to the tuck in the background. I'm still split on it. \n\nThe reason I'm split on it is the way that everything falls seems very in line with the weight of parts on a cheap car like that. Also, this would be super easy to pull off with a junk car. I've actually seen it done practically in my different films/tv/YouTube videos. I don't find the falling of the objects suspect at all except for the bumper seeming overly flimsy. \n\nVery confusing video.",

Also, you can see when the driver and front passenger are supposed to pull the door handles, releasing them from the door latch so they fall to the ground but only the driver accomplishes the task as the passenger door swings out at the front, which I would assume put to much sideways force on the door latch mechanism to release. \n\nI say so well done it looks like CGI",

Even if the right headlight was being pushed by the bumper somehow, the collision still looks unrealistic.

The parts don't have the right weight, they don't \"look\" particularly heavy or bounce the right way on the ground. The lighting is just slightly off and \"unreal\" too.\n\nI do think the passenger and driver doors *are* real, though.  The driver door bounces convincingly, and the passenger door doesn't really do anything weird (I'm pretty sure the passenger is just opening and waving it).\n\nI do agree that this totally *could* be done practically and IMO would look a lot better.  I just don't think that it was.",

The sharper edges and being made or metal causes it to stop as soon as it lands.\n\nThe bumper flops around since it's made of plastic (thin plastic at that) as well, but mostly around the edges since there's usually a reinforced bar down the center.\n\nLooks plenty believable to me.",

Took him a little bit, but he found one finally. The cabbie gets out, unties a door, throws my teachers suitcase in the back, has him sit down, and hands him the door. This is followed by something along the lines of \"Here, you hold this and I'll drive.\" They drove for about an hour and my teacher just held the door in place until they got to the hotel, where the driver gets out and takes the door back from my teacher, lets him out of the cab, ties the door back in place, hands him his bags, and drives off.",

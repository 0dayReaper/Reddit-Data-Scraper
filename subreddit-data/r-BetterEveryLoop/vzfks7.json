First he needs the king capacity to actually inhale and exhale enough vapor, then the actual breath and diaphragm control to push it out in the correct motion, form, speed, and density. Finally he has to have complete control over the air movements in a fairly large space, every single part of his body, when it moves creates air movements that can throw this entire show off, putting his foot down too hard or walking forward too fast can completely ruin it.\n\nThis goes far beyond eye hand coordination, and it's very impressive.",

The IDF was one of the latter: it has a \"characteristic **lag time**\" to sudden unexpected changes in velocity. The ship's computer can communicate with the IDF generators, such that no acceleration is experienced in normal spaceflight, but when an external force happens, the generators can't be told what to prepare for, and thus take time to sample the movement and calculate the correct IDF geometry.",

It doesn't have to hurt, but sticking it out there every time someone comes in, stops so much forward pressure as you said. Yeah Cerrone's intercepting knee definitely comes to mind, as it's pretty much the only answer to pressure he has. I'm curious what a front stomp kick like Whittaker or Romero would do for him, or even the low line side kick.",

The booing, I believe, was due to the lack of action before the knockout. Lyotos style has always kind of relied on him staying out of range and peppering his opponent with enough to score points, but not always enough to get a finish, which is essentially what this fight was right up until the end.",

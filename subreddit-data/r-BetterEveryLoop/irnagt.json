The way he slams his coach is why this fits here.\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it.

It doesn\u2019t hurt any more than just falling backwards would, and it\u2019s something wrestlers will do to mess with each other all the time. That\u2019s why the coach is in such good humor about it.",

The biggest problem with any move from the over/under position is that the other guy has exactly what you have, so you could just as likely be the one that ends up getting thrown. Damn if it isn\u2019t fun when it works, though.",

I wasn\u2019t a lifelong wrestler, but when I found wrestling in high school I was very passionate about it and found something I could devote a part of my life to. Anyways, it was my junior year, and I won a match that nobody expected me to win. I, being hyper focused on wrestling a for a few years, felt pure ecstasy in that moment as my friends and family cheered for me. Being victorious in something that you care that much about is like being high, and that must\u2019ve been the highest I ever felt. That\u2019s what I see in this video.\n\nMy family took me to Big Al\u2019s afterwards to celebrate my victory, and I pigged out on mediocre food and played lots of arcade games. Whenever I try to think about a happy moment in my life, that memory is what pops up first.",

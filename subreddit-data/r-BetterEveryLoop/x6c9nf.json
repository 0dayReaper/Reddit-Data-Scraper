You can also rotate along the transverse plane (what you call vertical axis), where you are spinning to your right or your left. If you combine the two, doing a flip, but also rotating your body 180\u00b0 to your right or your left so you land facing \"backwards\" it's called a round-off if you use your hands, or an aerial if you don't.  \n  \nThese terms may not be universal, but it's what I learned as a kid when my brother was doing gymnastics.  \n  \nquick edit: Frontal, transverse, and sagittal plane *are* universal anatomical terms, though.

Another cool term is if you're doing a flip and you set your hands on the ground to push off and complete the rotation; hand-spring.  \n  \nSo a round-off is a hand-spring with combined half rotation.  \nAn aerial is a flip (no hands) with a half rotation.  \n  \nIn gymnastics competitions you'll often see a gymnast perform a long series of cartwheels and hand-springs from one corner of the mat towards the opposite, building momentum until they bounce up into (often) a double front or backflip. Throwing your hands in the air is a surprisingly effective way of reducing rotational inertia, and looks very celebratory (for a detailed explanation: [Smarter Every Day's video on cats landing on their feet](https://youtu.be/RtWbpyjJqrU)). Points are awarded based on how tight the rotation is and how solidly you plant yourself on the landing. Feet together, good posture, minimal wobble, etc.",

I don't understand why people are so excited about it. The girl is nice but the trick itself is far from high difficulty.",

They would ALWAYS start chants, which even during duel matches with our own conference opponents nobody did. It would start out innocent where they would chant about winning at the time, then we would chant about having girls, they would chant about them being ugly, but one year one of the senior lineman got up and started going from person to person and telling them what to chant. That chant turned to \"Priests don't fuck us, *clap clap clap clap clap*\". We got about 6 rounds of it in and the AD and sophomore class principal came running from their seats to stop us. The wrestlers, coaches and some fans were laughing, we saw a few middle fingers from their side and that was the end of the chanting.",

That video is one of their most viewed on Pokerstar's YouTube channel and for good reason; it's really fun. I'm not sure if that's his tactic though, because he isn't really that good of a player (he read his cards wrong like 3 times during that game) but if you want to see that tactic in action, go watch Daniel Negreanu play some tables!      \nEdit: I'm not saying Kevin Hart is a bad poker player, just that I don't think he's operating on that high a level of psyching the other players out. These are professional poker players and he's keeping up, so he's definitely better than I will ever be.",

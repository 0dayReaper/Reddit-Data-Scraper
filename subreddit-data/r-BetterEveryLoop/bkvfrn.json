You can guess that this guy trained specifically on this course for quite some time. The show is probably part fun part propaganda for the Chinese military.\n\nEdit: the full set in the corner \u51a0\u519b\u4e4b\u6218 roughly translates to champion of battle or war. So maybe not strictly military. But I\u2019d still say the guy had lots of access to the course.",

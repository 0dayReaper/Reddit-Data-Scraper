Its just the perfect shape and size to fit against me and keep the cold air from sneaking under the blankets as I\u2019m a side sleeper. When travelling I need an extra pillow to take it\u2019s place. And I sometimes wonder what normal people do with their arms if not hugging a pillow or animal or something? Does your top arm just dangle down in front of you? \nMy husband makes fun of the bear but puts up with it. I know it\u2019s weird, but being too old for a stuffed animal doesn\u2019t seem like a compelling enough reason to try and sleep uncomfortably without it.",

It was around Easter time so there was a bunch of stuffed animals. So I saw the cutest little gray bunny on the bottom shelf! I picked it up and knew she\u2019d be a good friend. I also picked up two others (all different) and took them to work the next day! I gave a small bunny to my friend/coworker, and gave a monkey to another friend/cw. \n\nThat honestly made a huge difference in our days! Sometimes when they were stressed out I\u2019d see them give their stuffed animal a quick hug. And we\u2019d occasionally sit at the edge of our cubes and eats lunch together with our stuffed animals next to us! \n\nWe\u2019re adults/professionals and have stuffed animals now. We\u2019ve had a blast and made great memories! \n\nNow, our last day at the office (March 16th) we all took our stuffed animals to work from home. I sleep with my stuffed bunny. Highly recommend! \u263a\ufe0f",

They are all a lot smarter than we give them credit for and it regularly surprises people. \n\nLook at the way the kid seems to gently touch to dogs eye as if to say \"look here\". There is a definite connection of ideas there and pretty much all kids are capable of it with the right stimulus. I'm sure that kids parent have done something similar when they read the book to the kid. Now the kid is showing the dog in the same way. They really are sponges.\n\nThis video is way too damn cute though.",

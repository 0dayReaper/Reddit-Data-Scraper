He went to the washroom, and my buddy loaded the air blaster and when the kid came he blasted him and the kid fell backwards into the bathroom. My buddy had a good chuckle and returned to work. Well the kid didn't come out of the bathroom for 20mins, finally we noticed he had not come out and when we opened the door we found him lying on the ground. My buddy stated freaking out insanely worried and flipped him over to start CPR. The kid was fine, but he had a sopping wet towel from the toilet that he slapped my buddy in the face with as soon as he could.\n\nThose were good days.",

While in college I was out having a smoke break with my coworker/roommate and just face planted into a pile of snow (luckily). He had dealt with me after I had one before so he knew what he was in for.\n\nCop rolls up as first on the scene because onlookers called an 911 (I'll get to the ambulance later), super nice lady, had worked with her in the past since I worked IT on campus. I could barely stand up but for some reason I tried to fight this lady. Friend was holding onto me and didn't let me go lol.\n\nExtra ambulance knowledge... The first seizure I had while up at school they called the ambulance, I signed a waiver saying I didn't need to go to the hospital after I came to. Months later we get a bill for thousands of dollars due to the ambulance.\n\nThis time around when it came time to sign the paperwork, I told them I wasnt going to because they tried to charge me the last time, guy basically said \"we can't let you go then\" so I walked inside before they could stop me, swiped my badge, let the giant metal door close and called my brother to pick me up. No fighting ambulance charges this time around.",

Two guys approached her with a gun demanding the money. \n\nShe just dropped to the ground pretending she had a full body seizure. She's a psychology major and used to work in a kids hospital. She said she remembered about her epileptic patients and went full epyleptic. \n\nThe robbers got scared and ran away. After people gathered around, she stood up and asked for a taxi. Pretty ballsy for 5 foot woman on her early sixties.",

If I ever met this kid I'd tell him to his face he's a piece of shit and nothing about this is cool. Laugh all you want until someone you love dies in a tragic way and then you get to live forever with people making fun and jokes about very serious conditions. Grow up.",

What would happen if someone ran over to help with medical knowledge, as I would do when I see someone having a seizure, he gonna stand up and say \"sorry I was making fun of a life threatening issue in public and you actually cared\" just seems shitty imo.

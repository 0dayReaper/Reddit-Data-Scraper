They fall or do a wild clumsy flip and then start licking themselves, or sit down, or slowly walk away like nothing happened. They NEVER look shocked at their mistake though, that goes against their cat code.\n\nI swear, the way cats ALL play off their acrobatic failures, it\u2019s clearly part of their DNA code. It\u2019s  like they got an internal voice going in their head saying \u201ceveryone is watching me right now, just play it cool, just play it cool, they will think I meant to do that\u201d\n\nBut why?\n\nI can\u2019t think of any other reason why this behavior of playing off mistakes, even evolved. Seriously what advantage could it have served? \n\nThe first thought is playing it cool makes them look better in front of perspective mates. I would believe that if I didn\u2019t see wild cats rape other cat. I don\u2019t think male cats care about consent (assuming they are bigger animals and can over power). I never see male cats wining and dining their females in the wild, there is no courtship. It\u2019s just fucked up cat rape (and their females never seem to be into any of it). Even in lions the biggest ones come into the pride kill or chase off the old male lion and eat his children and then rape all the females and make a new harem.\n\nWhich goes back to\u2026why do cats all try to \u201cplay it cool\u201d when they make mistakes? If their prey thought they were clumsy it may let them take their guard down and make hunting easier, so that can\u2019t be it either.",

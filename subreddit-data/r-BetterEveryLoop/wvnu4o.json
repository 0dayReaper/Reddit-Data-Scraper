Scientists who worked on some cool innovation in electromagnetism also were working on other innovations in say, newest toilet design. Basically, there wasn\u2019t a whole lot of sub-disciplines under the Science and Technology category. \n\nNow, we are in the age of hyper specialization. So there are still expos showcasing latest developments in say industrial micro-plastics but the audience for that isn\u2019t interested in micro-plastics for medical use. All the expos and conferences now are hyper focused on their niche. \n\nAll in all, we have more science and technology expos now than ever but they are all niche specific unlike the past where they were all under a single really large tent. In fact, if you took all the major innovations in Science and Technology today, you probably couldn\u2019t practically showcase them in one giant expo. \n\nOther factor - back then, innovations were easily demonstrable say if you built the incandescent bulb like Edison did. Now (and I mean going back a few decades), let\u2019s say you put up a booth demonstrating innovation from CFL to LED bulbs. To a technologist, it is still a marvel but to a layperson, they just see a bulb. Or, how do you demonstrate going from 14nm chip manufacturing to 5nm? There\u2019s nothing to see. So expos focus on demonstrating innovations to experts in that area and not laypeople.",

There wasn't any real risk of being attracted to someone who I'd be seen as legitimately creepy for trying to date (as though she'd date me anyhow, we'd almost certainly never meet to begin with) but man does it make that movie a little different to watch now.",

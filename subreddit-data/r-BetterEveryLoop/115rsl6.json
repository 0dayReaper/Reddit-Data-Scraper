That takes some skill.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;The next time you watch it you realize that at some point far away from the hole in the death rocks there is a point of no return. No breaks, no real steering, just the consequences of choices you made when you stepped off the helicopter into free space.\n&gt;\n&gt;Since this is Reddit, the third time you watch it you probably say \u201cI could do that\u2026if I wanted to.\u201d\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment.

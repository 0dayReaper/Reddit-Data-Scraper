Goes to college and double-majors in physics and chemistry. Writes a phenomenal senior thesis regarding the sublimation of irrotational and incompressible aqueous Bernoulli solutions and the possible ramifications for more efficient combustible engines. Gets into a top-rated Ph.D. program and does a semester in Sub-Saharan Africa, where his research focuses on finding better, more cost-effective ways for fresh water collection and transportation, which leads to a healthy NSF grant that then leads to a revolutionized way to deliver clean water to millions of people in otherwise arid, drought-stricken climates. \n\nWins the Nobel Prize for his work. Starts an NGO that becomes a very successful non-profit, with only a 0.05% administrative-cost overhead, that goes on to lift 250 million people out of poverty.\n\nDies an accomplished, happy, blissfully content old man, with one odd request upon his death:  that his ashes be scattered into the water of this amusement park ride.",

To make a living doing such a physically demanding job means that he must be at least fully functional, if not healthier than the average person. Dance isn\u2019t just about flexibility; consider how strong you have to be to overcome both the force of gravity acting on your leg, which is like 20% of your body weight, and the elastic force of your muscles/joints pulling it back down. Good dance technique protects the joints and may even strengthen them against future impacts over time, as a dancer builds active (strength-assisted) flexibility. All of this is to say that this guy\u2019s joints are likely far less in danger than yours or mine are on a given day.",

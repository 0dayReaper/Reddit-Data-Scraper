Just the thought of the queen doing this alone is hilarious and warrants watching it over and over again. Also, the Queens thought process is clearly written out here. She's terribly bored and Philip is probably nattering away at her, and suddenly COWS! And she fights the urge to say, \"COWS!\" for a moment before giving in and succumbing to the inevitable joy of cows.\n\nIf you don't want to get deep about it, it's hilarious and it has cows and the Queen.\n\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

Any gloves rule would be less about the Queen and more about 19th-century etiquette about how to greet ladies (i.e. not touching the bare skin of a woman who isn't your wife).  \nBut there is traditional etiquette, and from what I've heard, you're a) not supposed to extend your hand before the monarch extends theirs (Queens and, someday in the future, Kings of the UK) and b) not speak to them before they speak to you - if you're their subject, at least. From the monarchy's own [website](https://www.royal.uk/greeting-queen):\n\n&gt;Before meeting Her Majesty, many people ask how they should behave. The simple answer is that there are no obligatory codes of behaviour - just courtesy.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, many people wish to observe the traditional forms of greeting.\n&gt;\n&gt;For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way.\n&gt;\n&gt;On presentation to The Queen, the correct formal address is 'Your Majesty' and subsequently 'Ma'am,' pronounced with a short 'a,' as in 'jam'.",

I always remember one where someone got flustered when she gave her flowers and told her she could hang them in the airing cupboard to dry them. Then afterwards felt so stupid because how likely is it the Queen uses an airing cupboard. But her lady in waiting apparently called back and said the Queen wanted to know how to properly dry the flowers because she thought it was a fantastic idea. \n\nShe's a diplomat, a true diplomat. I don't especially think the royal family has much relevance (being atheist I don't believe they're a blood line chosen by God) \n\nBut she is a special person. I don't think we'll ever have a Royal like her again.",

I SEE COWS IN THE DISTANCE!!\" \n17 years later and we still shout at cows in the distance. I don't live in the same country as my mum anymore so this made me smile/shared it with her with no explanation. She got the reference and it made her day. \n\nNot that anyone cares but whatever, my mom is adorable and the internet can deal with a happy mom/daughter story no one asked for.",

My mom stopped the car, got out, found the tear in the fence, and got the cows mostly herded back in before the farmer made it to the street. (Six-year-old me sat slack-jawed in awe in the car.) He thanked her and gave her a side of beef.\n\nThere's my mother/daughter cow story!\n\nI will forever moo at cows, and I miss my mom. I, for one, appreciated your story!",

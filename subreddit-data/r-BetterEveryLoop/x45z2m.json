Somewhat similar to when you mesh your fingers together. This allows the transfer of rotation through all positions of the suspension (including when you turn all the way left/right). The system is held together by other parts (ball joints) so it can't come apart unless something fails. Usually in an accident, they won't fail unless weakened by rust corrosion or not having grease injected during maintenance.",

                    "comment": "So obviously this all happens because gravity wants to pull the plates down into the lowest position. But then you also have the fact that the plates can only interlock to reach that lowest state in a certain rotation relative to each other. The plates *not* interlocking perfectly in other positions is what allows the plates on top to push the plates on the bottom at an angle to make them spin. The friction between the plates keeps them all sort of locked in place while they rotate (the top section of plates all stay roughly in the same relative position to each other until the end).\n\nNotice that the plates spin faster the lower they are on the stack before the weird breakdown/reverse near the end. More force is pressing down on each plate because there are more on top, and so when the spinning reaches them, they get accelerated into rotation faster.\n\nWhat happens near the end are several things: \n\nFirst, eventually the rotation speed and downward force reach the point where a lower plate overcomes friction enough to freely rotate from the plate above it and lock into place with the plate below it, causing a discontinuity which splits the process into above and below that boundary. (see note at the end)\n\nSecond, now that the plate above that boundary has nothing to push against below it while still having the same momentum, it can overcome friction enough with the plate above itself to spin more freely. This moves it into a position where the plate above can then move down to lock into position. Then that set of two linked plates has enough mass to slightly resist the pushing motion above and the next plate falls into place. This is like the crashing of a wave, with the effect quickly working its way up the stack. (there are some complementary effects going on here at the same time... this whole thing is surprisingly complicated the more I think about it)\n\nThird, below the boundary the two plates that are interlocked now act as a single unit with more momentum. They overcome friction enough to move into position to interlock with the one below, hitting it with enough of the rotational energy to send it moving to continue the process downward, and this is like another wave crashing in the other direction.\n\nFinally, you have the two stacks above and below the boundary each independently completed, and the rotation between those stacks at the boundary eventually slows down due to friction. When the motion is close to coming to a stop it's just the relative positions of the two stacks that will determine which way they have to rotate to finally lock into place. It could have potentially rotated further before that point and then the direction of final rotation would have been the same as the initial rotation. Or, if it were in *just* the right speed and alignment, it could have stopped at a point where they would stop at a stable non-interlocked angle just like the initial positions.\n\n(edit: \n\nThere are actually multiple stages where similar kinds of discontinuity are happening with the plates in this video and they have complicated interactions, but we'll keep it simple by just focusing on one. \n\nThere's also the case of the plate at the bottom acting as a final point where rotation can't occur since there won't be enough force to rotate the whole counter below it, and so any spin reaching that point would just dissipate - the bottom plate is sort of like its own special point of discontinuity as well.)",

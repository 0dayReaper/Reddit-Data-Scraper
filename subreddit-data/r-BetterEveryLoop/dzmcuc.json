Sure his serves at the beginning of his career were significantly slower than most, but the spin he put on compensated for that and made it a pain in the ass to return. Also, his forehand was an average of like 3 feet higher when crossing the net than any other player at the time. He was able to hit the ball with so much spin that it was crossing the net like over 4 feet above the top, and still landing well in play. Incredible stuff to be able to do over and over so consistently. That\u2019s why he beat Federer, and has won vastly more than he\u2019s lost to Feds.  His style was like the complete opposite of Feds, but it fuckin worked. Those were the days. The best matches I\u2019ve ever watched. I\u2019ll cry when he retires.",

The surface is very quick, and the ball doesn't bounce as high, so you're forced to adjust your footwork and bend your knees lower, to get a nice hit of a low-bouncing ball. This comes with a risk of knee and back pains that are a bitch to deal with.\n\nThere's a great variety on hard courts, so the difficulties really depend on the pace of the courts [Court Pace Index] or how fast the courts are. Generally, they're harder on the knees than clay courts, and it has its challenges when it comes to movement, because on clay and grass, you can comfortably slide on the surface to cover distance, which you can't do as easily on hard courts, so that's a minor downside.",

(His managers on the other hand...). I\u2019ve never really cared for tennis, but I gained masses or respect for Federer and how he conducted himself towards the arena staffing. Honestly seemed so genuine.\n\nEdit: I still think he looks like the guy from Lazy town tho.",

So when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but Roger Federer.\nI was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Roger, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Roger put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.",

There's always some people who come into anything Ali-related with their bigoted views on the stuff he did in his 20s, but never acknowledge that he made up for a lot of that stuff over the following fifty years.\n\nI'm a fan of the guy, but I don't give him a pass for the shit he pulled with Frazier. I understand what he was trying to do, but I don't agree with it. But, I do understand that he lived a complex life and ignoring the context surrounding it is a fool's endeavour.\n\nI'm sure someone could make Mr. Rogers seem like an asshole if you only focused on the bad stuff he did. They'd have a tough time of course, but I'm sure it's doable.",

The calcium in milk is weaker than the calcium you'd find in, say, leafy green vegetables or another person's bones or oysters. Naturally when your bones absorb this calcium, it leaves then more brittle than before.\n\nNot only that, but it takes calcium to absorb calcium. You could help this process with vitamin D-The sun comes to mind, right? Fool! While you can get vitamin D from the sun, you would have to be ENTIRELY exposed to it for over 90 minutes without sunscreen to get even a little. It would leave your skin completely damaged  !",

First they synchronise the mount, kip and giant swings to each other. Then develop a rythem and count and start incorporating the routine to have an overlap.  Thus decreasing the possibility of a collision.  That being said it was probably several hundred hours of training to accomplish this incredible routine. Bravo!!!  Edit: If they wanted to they could probably have enough time during the swings to add two more sides and go super crazy!",

One of the moves was us lining up in two rows facing each other. We would swing the rifles across and throw them to the other side so the bayonet would be spinning through the air. After practicing this for only a couple days our instructor started the drill like normal but during the middle of the drill, he began walking through the middle of the swinging rifles in perfect time so the bayonets would swing by his face at just a couple centimeters away. This surprised us all but because we had practiced the movement so perfectly, it was easy to compete the drill even with the added danger factor. I'm sure these guys had their slip ups, but I assume that the movement practice before adding it all together is what makes this much less dangerous. I'm not trying to downplay what these guys are able to do, just trying to point out that you're capable of a lot more than you think if you practice like crazy!",

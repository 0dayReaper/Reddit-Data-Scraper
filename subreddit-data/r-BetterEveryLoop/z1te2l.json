By tilting their heads slightly, the next time the sound occurs they can find it.\n\nMy favorite part of this is telling people that they do it to.  Next time you hear a strange sound, I bet you'll instinctively move your head ever so slightly.  That's your instincts trying to triangulate the source.",

Sound hits their ears at the same time so they\u2019re unable to detect left or right nearly as well as humans or elevation basically at all. A solution to that problem is for them to tilt their head in different directions so sound hits their ears at different times giving them a better idea of where the sound is coming from.",

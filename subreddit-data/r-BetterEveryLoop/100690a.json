The concept is great, most of the rotary\u2019s problems simply came from the way they executed it. I\u2019m sure if the rotary was developed into its true potential instead of being scrapped when the rx8 flopped. Think about it, there\u2019s only been like what, 5 or 6 rotary generations? With so little room to develop piston engines would probably suck too.\n\nAlso people are quick to call rotaries unreliable because rx7\u2019s aren\u2019t reliable, but they forget to mention that the rx7 is 30+ years old at this point, any 30 year old car isn\u2019t going to be reliable.\n\nTL;DR Rotaries aren\u2019t inherently unreliable, most of the problems can be fixed if Mazda just put new engineers to work and made newer versions of it, and also most rotary cars are old as fuck at this point, back in the day they would\u2019ve been better.",

That\u2019s true, but with good maintenance and driving any rotary engine should last a decent amount of time. I doubt we\u2019re gonna be seeing 200k mile engines, but I feel like people think they\u2019re way less reliable than they actually are. \n\nAnyways I shouldn\u2019t be saying this, if people think rotaries are reliable in any way they\u2019re just gonna get more expensive, so uh for my own selfish purposes, I\u2019ll say rotaries are shit and no one should buy them. If you already have one give it to me so I can safely dispose of it",

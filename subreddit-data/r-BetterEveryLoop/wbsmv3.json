And he puts his right foot out and forward as both a brace and a shock absorber.\n\n(Understanding physics with zero knowledge of terminology and far too long without actively doing physics work)\n\nEdit: oh, and it's sped up. I fuckin figured that's too much speed. We're way to heavy to go from a standstill to that much speed without flying off if not strapped in.",

But that's just the concept of a seemingly invisible wall the dog has learned from, even if it didn't quite get the whole story. Door frame seems to have invisible wall = no go, need a human to open so can go.\n\nThis kind of stuff will also of course come down to the intelligence level of the individual animal. Even most of us humans keep making the same mistakes mistakes over and over at least to some extent, but those mistakes aren't going to be immediately painful as hell unless I guess that's what we want. Cats though are on average fairly intelligent as far as pets go so it'd be strange if they didn't learn the risks of doing dumb stuff pretty quickly.",

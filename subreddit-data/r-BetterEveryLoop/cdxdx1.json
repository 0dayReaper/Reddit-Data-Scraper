Just extremely stubborn. \n\n The time I realized she was smart was about six months in after her rescue. I forgot to feed her, and so she stood on the counter and threw my pizza on the ground. Then ate a pepperoni. \n\n So I'm pissed! I'm yelling at her and she's yelling back like Chewy. I'm telling her to go lay down, bad girl, and you're in trouble. Then she grabbed her bowl and threw it at me and started yelling again. \n\n I'm like oh fuck I didn't feed her. So I do, and she eats. Then goes lay under the table with her tail under her legs till I finally said come over here. \n\n She was just so stubborn and had such a personality. If she hated you she would mouth back. Only my mother, myself, and my brother could really command her. Everyone else she would howl back at. \n\n RIP Kira. I'm getting a mutt puppy this time after 30 years of rescue dogs.",

Yet he was so goofy and kind. \n\n He was sweet, and so great with kids with how silly he was. He never had a mean bone in him, either. \n\n I'll never forget on the 4th of July when the first firework went off. He nearly pulled my mother off the porch by taking off so fast, and she let go off this retractable leash which hit him in the ass. So he yelped, and kept running as the leash kept slightly going loose and retracted back into his butt hitting him. Each time he yelped, and ran faster and faster which made the leash get even worse. \n\n After the third lap around our house I finally caught him by diving for the leash handle, and I brought him in. He ran straight under the bed, because of how terrified he was. I sat there coaxing him out for about twenty minutes. Poor fella. \n \n We should have called him Goofer. The type of dog that could spend days looking at his own reflection, and walking behind the mirror to try to sniff his reflective butt. Then run around the room looking for the dog that apparently disappeared until he caught his reflection again. Rinse and repeat for hours! (I caught him doing that, and eventually had to move the mirror.)\n\n I hope my brother/roommate found a good home for him. Damn was he dumb, but so silly that he made everyone laugh.",

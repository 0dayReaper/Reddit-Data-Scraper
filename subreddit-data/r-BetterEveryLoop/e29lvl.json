But when I grew up there were hardly any realistic and cool female characters out there. Women were always prortrayed in this unatural, superficial way and there wasn't really anyone I could relate to. I don't think anyone relates to a personality that soly consists of makeup, beeing sexy, weirdly dramatic and/or stupid. \n\nI also think it contributes to some girls and women trying to be this version of a woman that they are told a woman should be like. And to the \"i'm not like other girls\" thing. Because when all you have been told is that women are these weird, superficial, shallow personalities, of course you don't think you are like that. All humans have more dept and complexity to them than just beeing sexy.\nThat's why female (and people of colour, non-hetro people and so on) represetation is so important! And I'm so happy to see these changes slowly happening\u2764 Everyone needs relatable rolemodels!",

So you had a photo of some naked dudes skinny-dipping with the caption \"Peek-a-boo boys, it's Spring!\"  Or a guy with a beard lying naked on a shag like rug, with the caption \"And he can paint, too.\"      \n\nFor decades I've wished I could find that book and read it again.

And this is true for more than games, thankfully this is slowly changeing, but when I grew up there were hardly any realistic and cool female characters out there. Women were always prortrayed in this unatural, superficial way and there wasn't really anyone I could relate to. I don't think anyone relates to a personality that soly consists of makeup, beeing sexy, weirdly dramatic and/or stupid. \nI also think it contributes to some girls and women trying to be this version of a woman that they are told a woman should be like. And to the \"i'm not like other girls\" thing. Because when all you have been told is that women are these weird, superficial, shallow personalities, of course you don't think you are like that. All humans have more dept and complexity to them than just beeing sexy.\nThat's why female (and people of colour, non-hetro people and so on) represetation is so important! And I'm so happy to see these changes slowly happening\u2764 Everyone needs relatable rolemodels!",

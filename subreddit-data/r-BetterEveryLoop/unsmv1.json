You only need to strike the lowest ball on the table first.\n\nSo I can strike the 2 ball then have the 2 ball strike and sink the 5 ball.  Totally legal.\n\nOr even yet you can do a kiss shot.  So same scenario I can strike the 2 ball first but then have the cue ball strike and sink the 5. Both are valid tactics.\n\nInfact after an initial rack.  I can strike whatever the lowest ball remaining is then using either of these tactics mentioned above, sink the 9 ball, then the game is over and I win.\n\nSo the only 2 major rules that matter in 9 ball (other than scratch penalties) is \"You must STRIKE the lowest ball on the table first\" and \"who ever legally sinks the 9 ball wins\"",

Basically means that every shot you take, you need to call the pocket (hole) that the ball goes into.\n\nIn this case, Chris Melling (the player in red) very clearly calls that pocket and makes it via that godly shot. It was 100% planned and if you see the actual game footage, you can see him taking measurements to confirm he can make it.",

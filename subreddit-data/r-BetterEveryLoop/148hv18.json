Watching the original with higher quality, you can see the ball looks pretty detailed before hitting her head. And a ball can absolutely change trajectory with the right spin and if it hits the rim and backboard at the same time. Also looking at the original tik tok poster, the girl only posts videos of her doing these dances and nothing else has CG effects.\n\nSo your theory would be that this girl hired a pretty competent effects artist and filmed this with the idea of it going viral, including her laughing pretty convincingly at the end. After it gets a lot of attention, she then does nothing but tik tok dances and doesn't post any other \"viral bait\" for 3 years.\n\nNot everything is fake. It's good to be skeptical, but if you're going to make a definitive statement, at least look into it.",

Those videos almost always nowadays have that TikTok watermark at the end. \n\nThe rest of TikTok has been tarred with that same brush and unfortunately it has come to be known as the home ground of the brain dead content creator. It is a shame because there are a majority of good creators on that platform who do fantastic work but inevitably it's the fuckwits who get the most air play and its guilty by association nowadays.",

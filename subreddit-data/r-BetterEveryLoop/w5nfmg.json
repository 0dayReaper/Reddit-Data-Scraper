I \u201cruined\u201d the show because I hawk watched him and actually spotted the slight of hand. Well spotted may be disingenuous. There was a sudden moment where I just understood the trick. I told him he was lying and what the face down card actually was and he said I was wrong. I flipped the card and I was right! But then he packed up and said I ruined the show and never forgave me. And the girl fucking cried. How come every time we get a chance for greatness it is squandered by a crying woman. I can\u2019t stand magicians they hurt my autism",

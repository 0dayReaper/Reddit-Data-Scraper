That's like saying the Bald Eagle should have gone extinct when their numbers dropped precariously low.\n\nGood thing these management decisions are made by educated, well-meaning scientists and not hateful, ignorant redditors. I for one don't want to watch our charismatic megafauna die off due to our apathy. They became endangered after humans destroyed 99% of their habitat. That makes it our responsibility to conserve the species.\n\n&gt; They don't try to reproduce\n\nMany animals, including the less glamorous species you care about so much don't reproduce well in captivity. It's hard to recreate the natural conditions required for successful estruation and reproduction for most animals, pandas aren't an exception to that.",

Oklahoma from 1990 to about 98 state fair if anyone was wondering \n\nThe best was the abusive clown in the dunk tank.  He would literally just roast everyone that walked by. It was great to just see people throw balls all him instead of the target. I thought he had the best job ever. Talk shit to people all day, get paid and rarely even get wet.\n\nHe told me I looked like a retarded ginger that just fell off a turnip truck at 9 years old lol",

It is surprisingly easy to pull a boat over the water because all of the weight is already balanced I used to work with a 50 foot speedboat at an amusement park and standard practice for us was for the captains to pull to boat up fairly close and then we would throw the lines onto the boat where deckhands would pull the boat in to the dock. When we did it it required very little effort. Granted this boat is much larger than the one I worked with so it would be harder, but still possible maybe with a few people.",

Third Mate almost killed a dude because he told me to take up slack, until i saw the pickup moving backwards involuntarily. Probably could have towed that truck into the water. \n\nCaptain I sailed with could get it 50 yards to within a few feet of the bollard he wanted that line going to.",

There's a good reason why you can search the internet or look in any book and you will never, ever see another example of this happening\" \n\nMy bad. I forgot they got this job off no credentials or any experience. For a second I did completely forget you know exactly what the person's job is in the video and can attest first hand as someone who not only knows, but can tell when the job isn't being done right. Man, I didn't even think of searching the internet. Here's something I found while not searching for 10 seconds.\n\nA\u00a0slungshot\u00a0is a maritime tool consisting of a weight, or \"shot\", affixed to the end of a long cord often by being wound into the center of a knot called a \"monkey's fist\". It is used to cast line from one location to another, often mooring line. The cord end is tied to the heavier line and the weighted end of the slungshot is thrown across the intervening space where a person picks it up and pulls the line across.\"\n\nDamn, you know what's even more crazy? They pick that shit up. They don't even catch it. It's like they wait for jt to travel a certain distance observing at an even safer distance where it falls and collects it on the water/ground so it's easier than carrying it that long distance. Shit! \n\nMan, I totally underestimated your knowledge on this one. \n\nLemme know if I need to /s for you k?",

Other times, as is the case here, you need to  get the mooring line a significant distance away to make that possible. \n\nIt's very hard to throw a heavy line a significant distance,  so often a \"messenger line\" is passed first. It's a lighter line that you can throw (one way or another) farther, easier, that has the main line attached at the end you don't throw. \n\nOnce the dock workers or guys on the other ship have the messenger line in hand,  they use it to pull the mooring line, or if you're in the USN, sometimes a tensioning wire or fuel hose across.",

Description:

For animated gifs and similar formats, that get better the longer you watch them.

Rules:

Animated, silent .gifs only: Flash animations, videos or websites are not allowed.
**.gifv links are explictely allowed and even preferred** if they are silent.

Direct links please: Any links that don't end in .gif or .gifv will be automatically removed. The exception here are gifs on gfycat, which should look like: https://gfycat.com/ThreeRandomWords. Don't worry though, a bot will help you out with getting direct link to your .gif in case you make a little mistake.
If you can't get it to work, you can [contact the Moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FBetterEveryLoop&amp;subject=I%20can%27t%20get%20this%20gif%20past%20the%20AutoModerator).

Self posts are meta posts: Self posts require mod permission. Message modmail for more information.

Don't Repost: [Use Karma Decay to check if you are reposting.](http://karmadecay.com/r/bettereveryloop) Also, search the subreddit for the title of your submission. If your gif (or a near exact duplicate) has been posted within the past 3 months or is in top posts of the year or all time
, don't post it again. If you see a repost, don't hesitate to report it. Don't get mad at reposter though (unless they're repeat offenders), there's no shame in accidentally reposting something, it happens to the best of us.

Descriptive titles: It's okay to make your title funny, but this sub is about gifs, not texts. This also means no resubmitting the same gif with a different/better title.

No trolls or hateful language: Post people beating on each other somewhere else, we're not interested. No rage bait, no bigotry, no politics. No personal attacks of any sort. No copaganda.

Moderators have complete discrection.:

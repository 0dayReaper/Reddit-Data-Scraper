Main issue is that the force of gravity at the surface is extremely dependent on the density of the planetary body due to inverse-square relationship between gravity and distance. You\u2019d likely want to selectively impact only metallic asteroids, and then I wonder if there are even enough near earth asteroids in that density profile to do the trick. Counterintuitively, It's possible you could actually decrease the gravity at earths surface by adding a lot of low-density mass (e.g. comets).",

There is now a pulling force acting against him through their joined hands as her inertia is greater than his jump. \n\nThis imparts a rotation around his centre of mass which is detected by his inner ear (where the human body sences balance) and triggers a subconscious reaction to stabilise himself. \n\nAs as he is now in freefall corrections to stabilise have no surface to push back against so his failing only makes him spin more which causes more flailing.\n\nEdit: grammar &amp; punctuation. \nAlso, anyone qualified in Newtonian Physics, please correct me. \n\nI'm only an electronics engineer and my understanding of mechanics sucks.",

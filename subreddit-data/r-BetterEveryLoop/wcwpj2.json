I'm not going to explain it much better than that.\n&gt;\n&gt;It's kind of ridiculous to explain but there are lots of details in the flopping and stretching of the cat. It is a fuzzy white cute cat. It's a bit fat. How much more do I need to explain, it's really short, am I at 60 words yet?\n&gt;\n&gt;It's like 10 seconds long. I don't know what to say about it.\n&gt;\n&gt;Let me buffer this with a few more words. It's a really short loop and I can't talk about it all that much...\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

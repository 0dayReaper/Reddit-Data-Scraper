I\u2019ve got a couple rocky mountain red squirrels that occasionally come down out of the pine trees in my yard to gorge themselves at my bird feeders or to yell at my 14yr old droopy tiddied Calico like she\u2019s a threat (r/pouchcatatoes is another cat sub you need in your life). I\u2019m subscribed to a ridiculous number of cat/dog subs, wildlife/bird/backyard Chicken subs so I figured I\u2019d add r/squirrels. It did not take me long to recognize a theme in there that I felt oddly familiar with. \n\nBack in high school, I was friends with this guy that had the craziest Mom in town. Not mean crazy or evil \u201cChristian\u201d Mom crazy, just happily off in her own little world crazy. I don\u2019t know how to even describe her other than to say I saw a post on that squirrel sub where OP was upset that a squirrel she met wouldn\u2019t wear the overalls she made for it. I immediately dove into their post history because I was sure I had found that long lost friend\u2019s Mom\u2019s reddit account. OP was not her but I still wonder if they\u2019re related.",

Frankly it just seems she met a rude squirrel, it could have accepted the gift, worn them a couple of times when hanging out with her, then tucked them away in the bottom of his nut drawer or somewhere.  Later when she asks why aren't you wearing the overalls I made you he could just say their at the dry cleaners and then just keep telling her that till she gets the hint that he doesn't like the overalls.",

My dad would always buy a program and then my brother and I would tear out the ad pages and make paper airplanes out of them. My dads tickets were in the 1st row of the upper bowl (which if you\u2019ve ever been to the the Silverdome, that was wayyy up there) and we would each toss a couple paper airplanes over the edge. Usually they would crash pretty quick and we would always laugh and get a kick out of the fans reactions after getting hit. \n\nWell one time my brother threw one and it must have been a perfect fold because the thing flew all the way across the field and eventually crashed into the wall past the end zone. My brother was beet red thinking he was gonna be in so much trouble but people started noticing the plane as it flew and when it crashed we could hear cheers in the crowd acknowledging the sheer distance it covered. It was pretty awesome and hilarious!",

I figured, cool why not and just started getting madly into it.  I played around with so many variations, where to fold the fold to get it a little more weight or what a fold on the wing in a certain place did.  It was fun!  People got amazed when I threw just a normal one off the balcony of a hotel I was staying at a long time ago because it just kept going.",

I asked my teacher \"how much tape are we allowed to use\".  teachers reply \"as much as you feel you need to use\". Me - uses 2 rolls of tape to make a ball on the front end and tapes on arrow style feathers on the back. Entire class is laughing at my paper airplane design, while the teacher is shaking her head with a facepalm laugh.  they are all testing their designs and I don't throw mine once until the competition has started and modifications were completed.   everyone else's plane maybe went a few feet before flimsily falling down, I then threw mine for the first time and with the weight of it I was able to hit the other end of the classroom wall. I definitely got the last laugh.",

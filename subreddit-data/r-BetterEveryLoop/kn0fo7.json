Came upstairs with the mask and hood on, and my dog saw me and started to run.  Forgetting I was wearing the gear, I thought she wanted to play so I ran towards her, and she took off running so fast she couldn't grip the hardwood floor as she tried to make the turn for the stairs.\n\nSlid into the wall, legs turning under her but still no traction, like a cartoon character.  As she finally was able to get moving, poop just started coming out and I immediately realized I was still wearing my gear and it dawned on me that she thought I was a stranger.  As soon as I called out her name, she immediately stopped, started wagging her tail and came right back over to me as if nothing had happened.",

My father had just bought a new pair of sunglasses which he unfortunately lost in the lake about 200 meters off shore. He was mad about that because it was a pricey, nice pair of sunglasses About twenty years later the son of our neighbors did a vacation in a hotel near the camp site at lake Balaton. He randomly stepped on that pair of sunglasses in the lake. He brought them back to my father.\n\nThanks for your attention.",

If the cat walked in front of us while we were watching tv, we would suddenly scare her and she would jump so high. We did that a lot and the cat fell for it every time. My family had such good laughs from her. \n\nMiss her though. She was our first cat. She gave us a long lineage of cat generations. Ever since we had her, our house always have cats. We had her when I was 6 and her generations went until I was 27 years old. She was an outdoor cat so she spent most of her adult life being away from home. We knew she wasn\u2019t missing. She likes her freedom so we let her have her cat adventures. Sometimes she comes back to \u2018check in\u2019 on us. \n\nOne time she didn\u2019t come back in a long time and suddenly one day she came back. I was SO happy to see her again. She was an old cat by then. Her fur was rougher compared to when she was a little kitten. She was a lot calmer too. She was very naughty when she was a kitten. \n\nI was so happy to see her again so I spent half day being with her and petting her. She still loved it. Deep down, I somehow knew she\u2019ll be leaving again. Maybe for good. That\u2019s why she suddenly came back after a long time, to say goodbye. \n\nThen, after a few days, she died in front of our house. She wasn\u2019t sick or anything. She just died, peacefully. It\u2019s like she knew it was her time and she wanted to die at her home, with her family. We buried her at our backyard. We\u2019ve had a lot of cats but she\u2019ll always be our favourite cat and she brought us so much joy.",

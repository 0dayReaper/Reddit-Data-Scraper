I don\u2019t know why there would be other dust in the upper atmosphere. \n\nI\u2019ll mention it here because I always thought (was taught) that the heat was from friction. I recently learned that it is not friction but compression. The gas in front of the craft cannot move out of the way fast enough so the front of the craft is compressing gas like a piston in an engine until it superheats and has enough energy to escape to the side.",

The specific material they use is called PICA-X. Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator SpaceX Variant. Even with an ablative heatshield the hypersonic passage of the capsule through the air is going to friction heat it until electrons are stripped away and you get plasma. It is this ionized plasma sheath that causes the radio blackout on re-entry. In the clip this is the gassy glow you see. But the chunks you see are the ablative shield doing its job.\n\nEdit: went to look up the specific ablative material used on Soyuz as I'm not familiar with their design. They use a combination of plastic laminates, Capron fabric sheets held together by phenol and formaldehyde glue.",

The heat is so high it melts the heat shield and red hot pieces fly away carrying that converted energy with it. \n\nIn order to get back without doing all this you\u2019d have to find somewhere else to divert the energy to.  \n\nThe answer is no, there\u2019s no other way to get out of orbit (or from way out like the moon) without heating up something a LOT. The space shuttle was able to do this without a heat shield which falls away, but that\u2019s because of the special tiles.",

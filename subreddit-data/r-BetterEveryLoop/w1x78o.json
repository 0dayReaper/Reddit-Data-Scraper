Since then, however, Wikipedia has become one of the most thoroughly sourced and vetted information aggregators available. In fact, even that first sentence in the page, \"A trebuchet is a type of catapult\" [has a source.](https://books.google.ca/books?id=1fwQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)\n\nI just don't feel like paying twenty bucks to read the same sentence out of a book when the information is provided right there, in the encyclopedia. However, it is nice to know that, should I desire to verify the information, it's all available to me at the drop of a hat, and maybe a few dollars. Still cheaper, and likely more accurate, than any Brittanica ever published.",

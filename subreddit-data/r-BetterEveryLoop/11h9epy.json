But im feelin a little skeptical here.\n\nI have no doubts shes doing some kind of leg excercise around the cone, like the ones i had to do as a kid for soccer. But the things that are tipping me off are this\n\nThe line in the wall behind her becomes nearly unnoticeable down by her feet. Could be the shadow making it blend into the wall, but with how pronounced those lines are its unlikely. Could also just be compression with all that movement going on by her legs, but i dont see any other signs of such bad compression in the video.\n\nHer right leg carries no momentum. Shes a small girl, and even inline skates for her are going to be pretty hefty for apparent strength. The precision at which she stops the skate and reverse it back seems too clean, too linear. It looks alot like an animator setup keyframes for the skate to move in one direction, then just duplicated and reversed them for the other direction.\n\nThen theres the shadows and how odd the skates seem to be casting, looks like basic shadow catching, but the lighting in this shot is weird to begin with so i wouldnt be terribly surprisedif that was the culprit.\n\nI dunno, i love videis showing kids doing badass things that i could never accomplish, i think its pretty awesome what humanity can achieve, but this one seems a bit too suspect to me. It wouldnt be terribly difficult or unreasonable to create a composite with the original footage from the bottom of the skirt up and the cgi below",

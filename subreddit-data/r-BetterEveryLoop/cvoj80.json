He\u2019s now scrambling in the water wearing nothing but a horse head mask, a cape, and tights while still being fully strapped into his snowboard.  After the initial tumble, his cape wound up over his head and covered his face, which, he said, essentially gave a similar effect to being waterboarded. With that, I can\u2019t think of anything else that has made me laugh harder than seeing the absolute panic set into whatever character he was pretending to be while flopping around in that shallow pond surrounded by people laughing hysterically.",

Help and run with first part of ground level rotation before hopping onto a bar when it starts rising while one or two more grab bars and push/pull as they pass.\n\nWhile empty for first load they probably stop momentum while the upper operator is directly on top for less wiggle while waiting, maybe have second operator on the other side of the wheel to help actual loading before hopping off for the ride.\n\nIdk though, that\u2019s the only way I can think of starting it, but I\u2019ve never seen one before either. It might be a lot simpler. This is super neat, people (some) are clever.\n\nThis clip makes me happy.",

Pull the bar down and I'm comfortable enough. This was one of her very first coasters, so she didn't know any better, but later on told me she was surprised they didn't have it lower. \n\nBut the ride starts, we do the first loop, and just out of the corner of my eye I see my sister lift off the seat and get way to close to getting out of the seat. So she's not hanging on, I'm trying to hold her down on my left. My mom is on my right laughing cause she has no idea what's happening. If you had asked us about the ride 5 minutes later, we probably wouldn't have been able to tell you anything because it pretty much just turned into survival at that point.",

            "comment": "This video started off as wholesome for me but the comments about carnies gave me a flashback. \n\nDon\u2019t trust carnies or the equipment owners of these rides. They give zero fucks about you or your safety. \n\nThose rides will be missing crucial bolts or parts that are there for stability and safety. Why? They broke, never replaced it, quicker and easier for setup/tear-down, just forgot, no clue how half of it is put together- you think of it and it\u2019s probably a reason. \n\nThe accidents and deaths from these things are insanely high and those shady fucks from owner to carny will pretend the shit failed versus negligence, obviously.\n\nI know this from firsthand experience and to think there are people like this still angers me to this day. \n\nMy story: It\u2019s the mid 90\u2019s and I was 11 or so, and my dad had a \u201cfriend\u201d that owned a bunch of these rides on a miniature scale for kids. So of course when the guy needed help running some events and my dad went to help out, I had to go. It\u2019s like a dream come true as a young kid. But this was so fucked.\n\nMy dad\u2019s friend had two events going on the same day and needed my dad\u2019s help. The event my dad agreed to help with was for a great cause but also really far away, took us like 4 hours or more to get there. But I was super excited to help out so my dad and I go about setting up this Ferris Wheel-it was motorized and a bit smaller than the one in the video here- but as I\u2019m helping my dad set this all up, I point out that like more than half of the bolts are missing and these bolts are what anchored the legs to other parts for stability and more. This was just a bit before cell phones were abundantly available so my dad had to go in and borrow a phone to call the owner of the equipment and dude said to run it without the bolts and it should be fine, just have a few less kids on it. \n\nThis is their mentality. They don\u2019t care. You\u2019re just money to them. So that comment before about these people not blinking or caring about a murder is dead accurate because they\u2019re likely desensitized to it.\n\nMy dad was fucked over because we drove four-plus hours to go set all this up and it was at a Ronald McDonald children\u2019s hospital. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, it\u2019s a children\u2019s cancer treatment hospital. My dad was stuck in a catch-22 moment. The option was to be safe and let nobody ride or try and be as careful as possible.  It was soul crushing for me and him. My dad decided to make it as safe as possible with what was available and run the ride. It was just too hard to tell all these poor kids dying of cancer or struggling for a chance at life to have a moment of happiness no and moreover sorry for setting all of this up to tease you. \n\nQuickly after setting it up, I walked to a nearby ace hardware store and got spare bolts and such to make it safer and nobody was hurt, but we were both devastated and worried the whole time. In the end my dad did an amazing job.\n\nI remember helping my dad get everything packed up at the end of the day. As we were in the truck heading back, I asked him how could his friend be so greedy, taking money from them, while also being so careless and carefree to risk killing children with cancer and his only reply was, \u201che\u2019s not my friend.\u201d This was our only exchange for the entire four-plus hour drive. I like to think now that he was as proud of me for asking such a question as I was of him for his reply.\n\nThis is one of my fond memories I have of my dad. He passed away, before his time, just a bit over a year ago at 55.",

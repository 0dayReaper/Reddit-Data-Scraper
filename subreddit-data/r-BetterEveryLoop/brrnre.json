Locked in a cold metal box, loud noises and vibrations rumbling all around you, suddenly jets of water start filling the chamber &amp; getting in your nose, ears and eyes?  And you have no idea how to avoid the water, when it will stop, or if it will ever stop?   I'm amazed a machine like this ever got the funding to be built, nevermind put out on an actual retail floor for real customers and their pets.  If you want to talk about teeth cleanings, a grooming session would be way more comparable for a pet.  This would be closer to waterboarding.  The video is hilarious though.",

Animals with brachycephalic skulls have extra requirements in order to remain healthy, it is very difficult for them to cool themselves down naturally and being trapped in a hot box where they can\u2019t escape once they\u2019ve had their quota of warmth. They can quickly succumb to overheating and die.",

If we had any fucking ounce of compassion for cats or dogs we'd stop buying these breeds, stop posting pictures of these breeds, and stop breeders from fucking breeding these breeds.  \n\nFlat faced cats and dogs are not natural.  It's a recent phenomenon and humans bred them to be fucked up because someone thinks that the deformed \"flat\" face was cute.\n\nYears ago the persian cat was beautiful.  Years ago the pug had an elegant shortened snout, and didn't have bug popping blood shot eyes. \n\n Cats and dogs are more beautiful with extended noses. But more than that, they don't have the myriad of health problems that come with this breeding.\n\nI wish we could see humans with bug eyes, caved in noses, teeth that are fucked up with a major underbite, with drool running down their chin, eyes constantly weeping,  and wheezing sounds when they try to breathe through their nose.  Then maybe we'd understand.\n\nIt's not cute, it's cruel.  Boycott this shit.",

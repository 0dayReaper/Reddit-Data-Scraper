It's frustrating, and similar to being drunk. Like that baby was trying to do something, was it to make the other laugh? Was it just an automated behavior to impersonate their parent? Was it scolding the other one? All answers I find unsettling.\n\n\nThen theres the fact that they're twins, and my stoner brain is over here seeing one of them lift their leg in response to the other doing so, like are they the same entity in two bodies, trying to make sense of itself? Like they both recognize that they were meant to be one and they're trying to get in sync and become whole again.",

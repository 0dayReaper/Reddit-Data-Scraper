After being removed from its mold, there were imperfections and the small line where the mold split that needed to be sanded out. After sanding down to a fine grit (the reason it is cloudy at first), it is dipped in resin again to fill in the tiny scratches created by sanding and create a glossy, smooth surface. This is why it clears up as it is pulled out.",

If wet sanding is used (and this is common when sanding epoxy) then nothing gets airborne. As for toxicity, most cured epoxies these days are considered non toxic and many are even certified as food safe. It is recommended that you use a mask when sanding, though. Any kind of dust getting into your lungs is not healthy, epoxy or otherwise.",

If you can smell it, nasty stuff may be getting into your lungs (of course not all smells are bad for you), but gases and vapours from epoxy and paints are likely to be rather toxic. I use one for spraying herbicides on a large scale, and although they have a strong and very unpleasant smell, it does not get through the respirator, but it is a very good one, rated for vapours, as well as suspended solids or liquids.",

All I can say is, if you could still smell it, it is highly likely something was not being filtered out that really should have been. But it is also possible that for something like epoxy, the only thing that would be adequate is a positive pressure respirator. I'm not super familiar with epoxy, i do know certain paints (particularly automotive), absolutely cannot be filtered with a simple respirator, it requires air supply from outside the contaminated area Feed into the mask. Maybe epoxy is like that too...?",

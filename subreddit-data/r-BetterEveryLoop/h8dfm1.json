Like, I would create a basic bouncing ball using some basic physics to define the timing of the loop and then manually warp the ball for the squash and stretch.\n\nNo matter how much I tried to define a clear beginning and ending to the loop, there'd be frame of overlap that created a stutter. Apparently this is still a problem today. Why? And why hasn't animation software gotten smart enough to fix it?\n\nedit: I see it in professional animated loops on a surprisingly regular basis and it infuriates me because it shows that animation software still has this pitfall and/or that people are getting paid good money to be too lazy to delete a frame so that it's seamless.",

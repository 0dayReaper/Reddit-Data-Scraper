I lost this anxious feeling when i peed on someones leg with my friends.\n\nLet me explain. Once we were very drunk and one of my friends got stung by a jelly fish and i remembered reading somewhere that pee neutralizes the poison. The jelly fish guy yelled to pee on him so we did with about 6 guys, hitting everything but the sting.\n\nHe thanked us afterwards and went on a rampage, killing every beached jelly fish he could find with a stick.\n\nPee does not neutralize a jelly fish sting btw.",

There is one family of frogs (called the true toads) where all members are toads, but there are lots of different frog species outside that family that are also called toads. It's not like the old crocodile/alligator distinction, where there is an actual taxonomic dividing line.\n\nTherefore, I find it safer to just call every frog a frog and leave 'toad' for DnD descriptions.",

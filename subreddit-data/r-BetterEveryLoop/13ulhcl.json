This on its own is already quite interesting, but then, a large burst of brown dust is shot out. This dust resembles a fart and is quite humorous. Additionally, this video is very unique as water towers falling over is not a common occurrence. I hope this is a good enough explanation\n\n---\nIf you think this gif fits /r/BetterEveryLoop, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn\u2019t, downvote it. If you\u2019re not sure, leave it to others to decide.",

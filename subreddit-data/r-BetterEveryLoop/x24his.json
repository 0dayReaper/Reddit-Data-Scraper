That doesn't excuse those for whom English is their first and/or only language.\n\nNo, not everyone learns proper English grammar in school.  In fact, if you come from an English-speaking country, chances are you *never* did.  I certainly didn't.  I've never been taught formal grammar in my entire life.  I just think about what I say and see if it makes sense.  Let's analyse \"stuff toy,\" shall we?\n\nA stuff toy could be a toy made out of assorted other items, like a Megazord, say.  It could be a toy where playing with it entails shoving it roughly into a container.  At no point, however, does \"stuff toy\" say that it is in fact a toy that has been stuffed full of something.  And I guarantee that same person would never say \"I stuff my bag behind the seat\" if someone asked them where it is.  They'd say stuffed.\n\nDon't try to argue the second language point.  That's not who I'm pissed off with.",

This was just what tipped me over the edge.  Just like \"could of,\" all this needs is for people to actually *think* about their language.  Neither of them make sense, but you can clearly see *why* they're said.  Could of and could've sound very similar.  Dropping the ed from the adjective makes the words flow together more easily.  Doesn't make it right, and actually changes the meaning of the sentence.",

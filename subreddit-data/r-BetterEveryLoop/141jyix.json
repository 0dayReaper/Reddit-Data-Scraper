In the very same sentence you were saying that people were somehow okay letting cats roam free. \n\nIt's stupid to be comparing cats to dogs roaming free in the first place. Because cats don't kill people. That is why people are okay letting cats roam free. \n\nDogs are leashed because they have the potential to seriously injure or kill people. That's it.

Try again?\n\nIt seems you are confused by your own statement. Here let me quote your comment word for word:\n\n&gt;People are freaking out about a dog on a leash\n\nBecause dogs can and have seriously injured and/or killed people AKA humans\n\n&gt;nobody seems to have a problem with people letting their cats roam around freely\n\nFirst of all, nowadays people prefer keeping their cats indoors more than letting them roam free. Secondly, **cats don't and never have killed people**. That is why **MOST PEOPLE** don't mind cats roaming free.\n\n&gt;How is it irrelevant? Your pet cat should not be allowed to roam free, killing whatever it pleases.\n\nIt's irrelevant to YOUR OWN comment, insinuating that letting dogs and cats roam free, unleashed is the same thing, when they're not.\n\nAnd you're still showing your mental deficiency by broadly generalizing and assuming cat owners aren't being responsible.\n\nMost people with cats are aware of the potential ecological damage caused by cats, in addition to the danger of letting their cats roam free, and a lot of people do keep their cats indoor.",

Also, they don't take care of the property an elevator has been down for weeks and they are down to two. The building has been there for two years and it's falling apart because they don't take care of the property. Also any conversation you have with them voice record it they don't need to know you are recording them as it's a one person consent for voice recording.",

There\u2019s a section where you give that person\u2019s name so that you can be sorted together. \n\nIf not, there\u2019s no way Atmosphere could\u2019ve known you both wanted to live together.",

The leasing office told us that we could room together and to reach out when the school year ended to get everything wrapped up. The people at the leasing office were actually very nice to us and told us they couldn\u2019t do anything even though they promised they would earlier.  It\u2019s hard for me to understand why they simply can\u2019t put the two of us together since nobody knows who they are rooming with yet. I emailed upper management today and I\u2019m hoping they will help us.",

Do you have any proof (I.e. screenshots of emails/texts) showing that Atmosphere would put you two together? I think that would really help your case. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be in Atmosphere too this year, I hope things work out for you both!",

To have somebody say they can\u2019t do something and then you show them an email and all of a sudden they can would prove the point of them being rude for no reason.   They were really nice today but we\u2019ll see how they are tomorrow.",

If you coasted through on Cs and didn\u2019t do any extracurriculars, it\u2019s gonna take stellar GREs to be considered. If you have a bunch of extra lines on your CV and good letters of recommendation, it\u2019s possible. Also: your most recent few semesters are weighted more heavily than your overall GPA at many institutions.",

Then went back to college and finish a second bachelor in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA at SNHU within a year since I was able to transfer a lot of units.  I was then accepted to ASU and Georgia Tech for Computer Science and Pratt Institute for a 3 year Masters in their Architecture school since also been doing art all my life so had a solid portfolio. Ended up going for Computer Science since I can always learn 3D/modeling  art during my free time from YouTube and Udemy so found CS the best option.",

    "postText": "Moving in from Chicago and it rarely hits 100 degrees here. Besides a hat how else should i bring to shade from the heat?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to anyone who gave me sound advice! Follow up questions: what incects are common around Tempe and how do you deal with them/ what do you do if you get but by them? Super allergic to mosquitos and have to deal with it with calamine lotion. (unless I really frolic around a forest then 2 tabs of benadryl for me!) Currently, I usually see ants, fruit flies, mosquitos, wasps, house spiders, centipedes, and silverfish. More wasps/ mosquito are common in the summer and ants in the spring. (Wasps are more of an \"oh sh*t  let's get out of here now\" type incident, - but I can manage it on my own and buy some wasp spray at target.)",

I\u2019ve been a desert rat all my life and I passed out from the heat my freshman year here. Lotta fun. Don\u2019t forget sunscreen, too. You\u2019ll also benefit from light colored long sleeves and hats on especially sunny days. The sweat isn\u2019t fun, but neither is skin cancer. I\u2019m brown and still got sunburnt. And remember: it gets easier. That first summer here was the worst one, but they get easier every time. Soon, you\u2019ll be shivering in 70. Good luck!",

Always carry water and drink plenty of hydrating fluids, nearly everyone carries a hydroflask or other insulated refillable bottle. The air here is so dry just merely breathing dehydrates you. On campus, if you're traveling across a long distance learn the \"A/C corridors\" where you can travel through buildings in the cool air conditioned hallways instead of walking through the heat. Being outside can literally feel like when you open the oven and the really hot air hits your face and body. \n\nLook up and know the [warning signs for heat exhaustion and heat stroke,](https://freeimage.host/i/HSJxAe1) both are very dangerous conditions to be in and knowing the symptoms can save your or someone else's life. The temperatures at night are still in the low 100s during summer so it may take some time to be acclimated to the warm nights with low humidity.",

So, sunscreen will not only keep your skin healthy but also reflect sunlight, keeping you cool.\n\nAvoid wearing dark colors if you know you'll be outside long. Dark colors absorb more sunlight than white. This makes dark clothes hotter. \n\nStaying hydrated is important. Someone recommended liquid IV. That and Gatorade have a lot of sugar. There's a product called Nuun. It doesn't have sugar, it's much healthier. \n\nShave your armpits. Wear thin socks. The armpits and feet have a major concentration of sweat glands. Keep both areas as cool as possible. An added benefit of shaving your armpits is that deodorant makes better contact and is thus more effective. Highly recommend.",

            "comment": "So here\u2019s some advice from a Arizona farm boy \n\n-Definitely wear lighter colored clothes, shorts, breathable shoes/sandals (this is kinda a must, you\u2019ll likely walk around a ton at the start of the year and a bunch of people get blisters from walking around with sweaty feet)\n\n-Get a bike/long board/etc (and along with a bike/others get a pretty good lock since bike theft is fairly common), this way you\u2019ll get to classes faster, be outside less, and the air will cool you off more.\n\n-For any events outside (especially sporting events) get a ton of sunscreen and make sure you use it\n\n-Like you said if you\u2019re someone who likes hats definitely wear them or like some other people suggested umbrellas can help too but not really as much of an option with bikes\n\n-stay hydrated, if you have a meal plan with M&amp;G go to the pod markets and invest into a decent water bottle fairly early on into the school year (you *might* also be able to grab a long board or bike there if you want to explore that option)\n\n- if you need more cooling besides that I know a bunch of people that used spray+fan misters to stay cool, neck bands/rags that you toss in the fridge/freezer, and some other small stuff like that.\n\n-to avoid a sweaty back get a breathable backpack or maybe even a shoulder sling/computer bag to take to class instead\n\nAlso complete side tip you also might want to invest in a humidifier one guy I lived with my junior year was from Chicago and got fairly constant nose bleeds for the first and last month of the semester from the humidity change.\n\nIf you need any other advice definitely feel free to ask!",

It depends on where you\u2019re coming from and going to, but I always try to walk through parking garages, which is a lot cooler than being in the direct sun without slowing you down.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like to be sweaty during class then it\u2019s best to get there a bit early (and/or bring an extra shirt to change into), but I also don\u2019t think anyone will judge you for a being a bit sweaty; it\u2019s somewhat inevitable.",

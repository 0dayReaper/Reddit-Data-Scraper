I currently do two classes every 8 weeks and this is considered full time so I get my monthly benefits. I see ASU is 7.5 week courses so would two classes still be considered full time for me. I'm having some trouble understanding if it's considered full time. Thanks",

Most classes are three credits, so at ASU you\u2019d probably take 2 A session classes and 2 B session classes, pretty much at same as what are doing at SNHU. \n\nhttps://benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/85_15/FTE.asp#:~:text=In%20standard%20quarter%20or%20semester,11%20credits%20are%20%C2%BE%20time",

Rate of Pursuit is computed from the Length of the Term and Number of Credit hours enrolled - so yes, 7.5 week terms and 6 credit hours would also be full time Rate of Pursuit.",

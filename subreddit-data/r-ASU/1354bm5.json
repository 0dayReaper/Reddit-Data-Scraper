Let the long handle rest against your arm up to the elbow, so the longer blade can be used to protect your back. Don't ever hold the combined saber with both hands, unless you're using it like a spear, even then though. I wouldn't. Switching hands though for sure.\n\nYou'd need to be really good with the technique, but I could see a Jedi pulling it off.",

    "postText": "Hi, I'm a Canadian highschool student heading into year 1 UBC Sauder next year, but I wish to transfer to Arizona State's W. P. Carey School of Business in the following year (year 2).\n\nWhat steps can I take to prepare for that? How do I plan my courses, etc.\n\nI want to start looking into this to be prepared as soon as possible, but not sure where to start, so I'm asking here on Reddit.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated, thanks",

If it\u2019s rejected then it would likely be applied as x credits of elective courses. At ASU, once accepted and allowed enrollment, you have the option of choosing which catalog year to follow in your major map (ex: you find more of your transfer credits can be applied on Fall 2025 catalog instead of Fall 2024, then you can choose to follow a Fall 2025 catalog even if you started your first classes in 2024). You might actually benefit by applying to ASU a semester or two early but wait until you\u2019re done at UBC to enroll - talk to an advisor and see if it\u2019s possible at the biz college.",

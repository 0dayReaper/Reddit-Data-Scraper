    "postText": "I am a student who will be transferring to ASU from Purdue in the fall. I will need to take a chemistry class because the one I did at Purdue only transfers as Chem 113 and I need either 114, or 116. Is one of those two classes easier than the other? I\u2019m not terrible at chemistry but not amazing in it so if one class is more math heavy that would be best for me. Any advice is appreciated.",

If you do have either choice though I would go for CHM 116 but both courses are relatively tough. I\u2019m a Chem major and have TAd both and they\u2019re pretty similar but CHM 114 covers both CHM 113 and 116 topics at a very fast pace. So since you said math isn\u2019t your strong suite I think you\u2019d be better suited in CHM 116 so you don\u2019t feel overwhelmed by the pace along with the math. Otherwise they don\u2019t really cover anything special in CHM 114 that you need to know specifically for engineering.",

Now they use canvas quizzes for HW and I believe it\u2019s insufficient practice. The textbook ASU uses if you\u2019re interested is Chemistry: The Central Science 14th edition. It is very expensive new but you can buy used copies for a more reasonable price then resell it once you\u2019re done. \n\nThere\u2019s a big shift in Gen Chem 2 from Gen Chem 1 where it focuses on chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, chemical thermodynamics, voltaic cells, and nuclear chemistry. It\u2019s not simple plug and chug into equations like Gen Chem 1 is there\u2019s a bit more reasoning and thinking involved which is why I recommend more practice. But if you did these topics at Purdue already then it should be like review for you and come back very quickly. In that case you shouldn\u2019t need any extra practice material. Best of luck to you and if you ever feel stuck in the next semester feel free to PM me and I\u2019m happy to help you with CHM 116 or 114, whichever you decide to do in the end.",

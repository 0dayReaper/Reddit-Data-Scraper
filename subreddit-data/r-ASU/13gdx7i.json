    "postText": "My friend and I will be spending the summer at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://www.youtube.com/c/UIUCTalkshow) campus. Why? No distractions, more time to talk to brilliant professors, and an opportunity to immerse ourselves in building the big project that we've been dreaming of for months.\n\nBut we don't want to limit this opportunity to ourselves. Why don't we also invite cool people from around the country/world to come and build their projects here too?\n\nImagine this: the sun is shining bright, the breeze is cool and refreshing, and you're surrounded by some of the most brilliant minds in the country. You're building something incredible together - something that you've dreamed of for months, maybe even years. The excitement in the air is palpable, and you know you're on the verge of making something truly special.\n\nThis is the experience that Midwest Hackers is meant to offer.\n\nWhy UIUC? It's simple. During the summer, the campus will be a sanctuary for innovation, free from distractions. You will be in close proximity to world-class professors, have access to state-of-the-art facilities, and brilliant students all within a one-mile radius.\n\nThe UIUC campus has a rich history of science and innovation, being home to the inventors of the transistor, LED, the first graphical web browser, Playboy, LLVM, computer music, and YouTube. In addition, five members of the Paypal mafia - Max Levchin from Affirm, Luke Nosek from Founders Fund, Jeremy Stoppelman from Yelp, and Steve Chen and Jawed Karim from YouTube - all studied at UIUC. It has an environment that fosters innovation and growth. Which is why we are going to be here this summer, building what we care about.\n\nIf you have the drive to do something truly different, this is the place to be this summer.\n\nWork on your projects, start a company, make new connections, and learn something new. This is your chance to think differently, push the boundaries, and build cool shit.\n\nIf this interests you, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdudKvL0DGejWKjD5FQ_vv4w4VyiHYxFtdSBfJF6YTytkeLgQ/viewform).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwvh1pp0tkza1.png?width=3200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ec0193daf73f410a4d53acd930ffee63df393d2",

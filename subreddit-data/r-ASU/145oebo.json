I\u2019m curious to hear about your experiences:  \t\n\n\u2022How long did the process take for you? \t\n\u2022What kind of medical evidence did you provide?\n\u2022Any challenges you faced? \t\n\u2022Was your withdrawal request accepted? \n\nAppreciate any insights or advice you can share. Thanks!",

            "comment": "The timeline depends on the college. Most have these petitions go to a committee, and in summer a lot of committees meet less frequently. When I advised in WPC I would tell students it would be about 2 weeks. \n\nFor documentation for a medical withdrawal, you need to have evidence of having medical (physical or mental) treatment during the semester(s) that you are petitioning for a withdrawal from. And there needs to be evidence of a change. So you won\u2019t get approved due a pre-existing condition unless you can show something substantial changes (hypothetical ex. A student has a clinical depression and they have a change in medication that causes a substantial impact on their wellbeing). So, you need documentation of treatment and that there was something substantial that changed in your health. \n\nWhen medical withdrawals are approved, they are most often approved for the whole term. If you are asking for a med withdrawal from only some of your classes, you have to demonstrate why you were able to be successful in some courses but not others. For example, a student has one class in Session A, one class online in Session B, and the rest in-person in Session C. The student has major emergency surgery during the latter half of the term. They were able to finish the A class and pick up with the B class while in hospital, but they missed too much of the in-person Session C courses. They would have a good case for a partial withdrawal so that they could keep credit for the A and B classes while getting a withdrawal from the C classes. \n\nThis info is based on my experience in WPC, and since this is a college decision, you may find that other colleges could approach iffy cases differently. But it really comes down to documentation and factors outside of your control.",

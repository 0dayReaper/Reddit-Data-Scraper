    "postText": "I'm aware that ASU has rolling admissions that extend till August for the Fall 2023 term. But I'm unsure about applying now as I don't know whether the admission cap for Computer Science with Cybersec/ Software Engg will be filled. Does it make sense to apply to ASU this late as an international student considering the fact that CS is a really competitive major to get into?",

I don\u2019t know if this is legit or not but they may not have guaranteed housing anymore now that it\u2019s May but I don\u2019t know for sure.",

I'm not really interested in living off campus as I've heard housing near Tempe is hard to find or very expensive.",

The worst thing that can happen is you probably won\u2019t get a spot in Tooker House - so you\u2019ll have to find housing elsewhere or live in a hotel (ASU will place you in one w/ other freshmen). All the best!",

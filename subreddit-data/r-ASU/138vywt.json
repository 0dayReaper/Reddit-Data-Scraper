    "postText": "Hello! I signed up for the summer class for ACC 241 with Dan Meyer. I tried to find a rate my professor but there were only two reviews. If there\u2019s anyone who has taken his class, how is his class structured? Is he a good professor? Also if there\u2019s anyone else who has taken ACC 241 over the summer, is there another professor I should sign up for? Thank you!",

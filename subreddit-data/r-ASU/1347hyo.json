(Also not a huge science person, but i appreciate all recommendations!!)",

I took Southwest and Arizona geography and it was pretty easy and the whole class consisted of quizzes. The 3 lowest quiz grades per category were dropped as well.",

Quick lectures with the homework and quizzes being open note, open book, open Google multiple attempts until you\u2019re satisfied. Projects are very easy to do and the write ups can be the bare minimum and you\u2019ll still get a 100. \n\nEven if you\u2019re not scientifically inclined the class is an easy A and you\u2019ll spend at most 5 hours a week (at absolute most) on the course.",

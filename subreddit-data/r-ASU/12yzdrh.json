    "postText": "Hi all! \n\nSo, I am interested in becoming a Airline pilot, it has been my dream since I was 7 years old, and with some research, I decided that I would like to go to Arizona State University. With that being said, I have a couple questions for you all. I do apologize if some of my questions are \"stupid\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I understand that the Pilot Program is at the Polytechnic Campus, does that campus have dorms there to live? Or are all students located at the main Campus at Tempe? Do students get a choice where to stay, or no?\n2. I currently reside in Vancouver B.C, Canada, what sort of differences will I face that compared to a local student? Will it be more expensive for me?\n3. What sort of grades must I have in order to get accepted?\n4. Most universities require you to apply at two different campuses, will that be the case with me? If so, where would I have to apply?\n5. How long is the program?\n6. What will the first day look like? I consider myself very social and extroverted, I am hoping that students will engage with one another?\n7. Around what time should I apply?\n\nThank you very much for taking some time in your day to read and answer my questions, I truly appreciate it!\n\nEDIT:\n\nWhat classes are recommended? I understand Canadian and American classes are different, but what did you guys take in high school?",

            "comment": "1). Yes\n\n2). It will be more expensive since you're OOS, plus you'll have more paperwork to deal with on the FAA side since your (presumably) not a US Citizen\n\n3). A pulse\n\n4). Not in my experience\n\n5). Most 141 programs like ASU get you your commercial within 2-3 years depending on how fast you progress through the program.\n\n6). Pilots are a mixed bag so your going to deal with introverts and extroverts regardless.\n\n7). As soon as practical.",

Every university has requirements so crappy answer\n4- Applying to just one campus will entitle them to take classes at any physical campus (Poly, Tempe, Downtown or West) including  online classes but not 'ASU Online' which is a separate entity \n5- Unless they are taking way beyond 12 credit hours a semester or doing summer sessions they aren't getting any B.S. in 3 years much less 2\n6- Seemed the question was a general student interaction not just the ones specific to that program\n7- Agreed unless looking at cost cutting and wants to complete some credits in their home country of Canada",

Do students get a choice where to stay, or no?\n\nYes but Off campus housing could be cheaper if you have reliable transportation.\n\n&gt;2. I currently reside in Vancouver B.C, Canada, what sort of differences will I face that compared to a local student? Will it be more expensive for me?\n\nYes Out of State is always more costly though unsure if it gets to be even more for international students.\n\n&gt;3. What sort of grades must I have in order to get accepted?\n\n1st year Undergrad is 3.0 \"First-year students must have a 3.00 grade point average (GPA) (a \"B\" or better where \"A\"=4.00) from a secondary school.\n\nSome ASU programs may have higher admission or English proficiency requirements and may consider a minimum ACT or SAT score.\n\nMust have three years of high school work (If you are currently in high school, ASU needs to see 9\u201311 grade work. If you have completed high school then ASU needs to see 10\u201312 grade work).\n\nMust have and present a completed high school diploma or certificate.\"\n\nThere are specific international student admission advisors that can answer better since I am unsure if ACT/SAT is only a US thing.\n\n&gt;4. Most universities require you to apply at two different campuses, will that be the case with me? If so, where would I have to apply?\n\nNo but some classes may be have more options at another campus. There is a bus that runs between all campuses that you can utilize if you need to.\n\n&gt;5. How long is the program?\n\nBS (Bachelor of Science) is a 4 year degree at the 12 credit hour rate.  If you are able to take an extra class every semester then you cut that time.\n\n&gt;6. What will the first day look like? I consider myself very social and extroverted, I am hoping that students will engage with one another?\n\nMost everyone is pretty chill on every campus as not only does ASU have a diverse student body, but most of AZ in general is not from here.\n\n&gt;7. Around what time should I apply?\n\nAs soon as possible so that you can begin in Fall of 2023 unless you want to save and talk to an advisor to the international students about what would be transferred from a local college there in Canada and save you some money by doing part of it there before transfer to ASU\n\nLook over the main website for the degree and it has many links in maroon to some of the different departments for answers : https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/TSAMTFBS/aeronautical-management-technology-professional-flight?init=false&amp;nopassive=true\n\n\n*Currently Senior year student at ASU",

If you talk to him, go to his office hours, and ask questions, he\u2019ll be a little more lenient with you. One of the fairest teachers I ever had at ASU.",

This is critical to understanding undecidability at the end of the class. Othe recommendations are make use of your resources. Watch Sipsers OpenCourseWare MIT lecture, read the book (can't stress this enough), and watch some videos from EasyTheory on YouTube.\n\nA lot of people may tell you it is a terribly difficult class. If you practice your understanding of the underlying mathematics prior to the coursework you can offset the difficulty.\n\nSome recommendations during the course being continuing to use your resources.... DO YOUR HOMEWORK. Colbourn doesn't grade hw, but if you think even for a moment that you can just not do the homework and be fine because it's not getting graded, you will increase your likelihood of failure. Practice and exposure is key to this class.\n\nSomeone correct me if I am wrong, but there is a curve in the exams, so if/when you get sub 50% on an exam, DO NOT PANIC.\n\nOther than that, enjoy the course. Or at least try to; it's one of my favorites in the degree.",

            "comment": "You can study automata, but like the other comment suggested, this is kind of the only class that covers it. You can probably learn some online, and if you\u2019ve already taken 340 it\u2019s just applied 355, so that can be pretty helpful if that\u2019s the case.\n\nHonestly though, the place that most people struggle IMO is in proofs, as all they have is MAT 243, which the jump between that and 355 can be a lot. The best solution would be to just pick up a math major, but I know CS is tough enough and adding on a second major just for one class is overkill, so here\u2019s some more non-overkill suggestions.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of set theory in terms of the symbols, so it can be nice to feel comfortable with those, as you can spend more time on the ideas being presented rather than trying to understand what the math notation is trying to say. You definitely do not need to be an expert in set theory by any means, I think just reviewing your 243 notes on it until you\u2019re comfortable is more than sufficient.\n\nAlso, some practice writing proofs can be helpful, as I\u2019d say roughly half of the class is making automata and the other half is writing proofs of why one can\u2019t exist or things like that. Again, just make sure that you\u2019re comfortable with the ideas present in 243, because especially on tests, you\u2019ll want your mind to be as efficient as possible, and being comfortable with proofs lets you see a problem and at least automatically go towards \u201cokay this sounds like I should prove by contradiction\u201d or something like that",

If you practice enough, then you will most likely get full marks on the design problems . The proof problems can be hard since it will likely be a problem you have never seen before the exam.But even if you can't write the correct proof, you can usually get partial credit if you identify the type of proof/theorem required and give some vague reasoning.",

It\u2019s pure theory, and up until this point, all of your CS classes have had some kind of practical application. 355 primarily covers the Turing side of the Church-Turing Theorem, so if you took CSE 259 and did well in 310 you\u2019ll have an easier time. If you did less than stellar in 310 or discrete mathematics, you may want to brush up on those before you start 355. Last thing: CSE 355 and CSE 340 are a LOT of work on their own, so if you don\u2019t do well with heavy workloads, I recommend you take them separately",

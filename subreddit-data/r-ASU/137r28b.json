I keep seeing all my friends happy to \"move on to the next chapter\" of life, and I could not be more terrified.\n\nI currently have a job lined up, and I think that it's the wrong path to take because the job is already stressing me out. I have been working there part time for about a year now, and I'm gonna be full time starting in June. The job is very stressful, and I constantly worry about going into my next shift. \n\nI thought this was the job I wanted, but now I have regret of doing it. And now I can't even change my major to study something else, and I don't know if i can afford to go back to school for another year for another degree. I just feel stuck in this path with no way forward.\n\nIs this normal? I feel like I'm the only one experiencing this and I don't know what to do. I've been having panic attacks because everything is just moving too fast. I just don't feel ready for the \"real world\" yet.",

It is normal, and I promise you that I and many others went through the same thing. If this is your first time experiencing it, I've learned to think of it as just a type of intrusive thought.\n\nI'll share with you what my dad told me: life is sometimes about figuring out what you're not - maybe you won't end up working in the field you studied; that's perfectly fine. I don't, and you might not either. You might also find that you like the job much more when you're working full time, but you won't know until you try it out. \n\nAnd for what it's worth, I am of the opinion that the dreaded \"real world\" is generally easier than being in school full time.",

Another aspect to consider is the stress itself. You need to ask yourself why the job is stressful. Are you in a bad environment? Is it the nature of the job? Are you putting stress on yourself?\n\nI think some jobs get less stressful as you get better at them. When I first started teaching, I was stressed all the time. As I grew and learned, the stress (mostly) got lower. Sometimes we give ourselves stress. We worry we aren't good enough or we have imposter syndrome. Most of my stress came from that.\n\nDo you have a mentor at work? If you don't, trying to find one might be really helpful.",

Small steps go a long way. \n\nI may be talking out of my ass since we\u2019re in very separate fields, but I\u2019m believing in you!

Try and find something that could turn into a career you like a lot. Worse comes to pass then you've had a couple jobs that didn't work out right and you could get a masters or something.

I had scored what I thought was my dream job and soon found myself in tears as I left my loved ones and friends to pursue this dream. I felt stuck, particularly when it turned out to be a nightmare of a job. I hated it for over two years and woke up everyday feeling regret. What I failed to realize was the skill set I was developing and amazing friendships with the people I work with. \n\nI saved up for a few years and now I\u2019m going back to school for an advanced degree in a totally different subject than my undergrad. \n\nWhat I mean to say with this is you\u2019re never really out of time. And you didn\u2019t mess up by pursuing your dream and doing what you think is right. You may not be able to take the next steps towards change right this second, but regardless you\u2019re still taking steps forward. Some steps feel heavy as hell. Like you have an anchor tied to your ankle. And sometimes it seems you can\u2019t stop running forward and can never catch a break. \n\nDon\u2019t forget that while you\u2019re experiencing and learning in situations you may even dread, you\u2019re still living. It\u2019s ok to go into a job you may hate or feel dread about for a bit and take your time to refine your interests and explore the job market. You may be able to find your way to a different career entirely without ever going back to school. But it\u2019s still your life. I no longer regret taking the steps I took, despite the still painful memories of the past. But it served as a bridge to a happier life for me. You\u2019ve got time and energy. It\u2019s scary now but you\u2019ll continue to grow and don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re still living and have the control.",

Finally, do not get trapped with kids, marriage or a mortgage too early.

No one is going to post about existential dread associated with graduation in an insta post. I graduated undergrad in 2013, I worked corporate until 2017 and then realized it wasn\u2019t for me and that going back to school was what I wanted to do. I wasn\u2019t sure about a PhD or law, got a masters, killed it and got a scholarship to law school which is where I am currently at ASU. I\u2019ll be done next year, I was 28 and had no damn clue as to what I wanted to do when I grew up and guess what? It was normal. I was praised by a lot of my peers for being able to take the plunge and get back to school, many of them gate their careers but didn\u2019t see themselves back in college again. I love to learn and scholarships helped to allow me to do that.\n\nMy point here is that you\u2019re just feeling the same existential dread that many people feel whenever there is about to be a huge change isn\u2019t their lives. This probably isn\u2019t the first you\u2019ve had, and it definitely will not be the last either. Just try to stay grounded and never limit yourself, you\u2019re never locked into o e single career or path in life. If you want, you can always change gears and head in a different direction with a little sacrifice, discipline and perseverance you can make it to a better place if you want that for yourself.\n\nYou can do it; I believe in you.",

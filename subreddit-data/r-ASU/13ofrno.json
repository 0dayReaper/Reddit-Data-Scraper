    "postText": "I dropped a class on 5/21 which is past their refund deadline for the A session.  However, my class is a dynamically dated and starts on the 29th of May and ends on the 1st of August. So, I'm a bit confused on whether or not I'll get a refund. It says on the summer refund policy, \" For the summer session classes (sessions A, B and C, and dynamically dated classes), the 100 percent refund period is the first five days of the applicable summer session.\" Does that mean my dynamically dated class falls in the A session or is it a session of its own? I sent in a question already to ASU but since it's a lot of money obviously I want answers now O\\_O. Yes, I'm stupid.",

            "comment": "Each dynamically dated course has its own deadlines set. You can see all of them by clicking on one of the icons of the course when it\u2019s on your MyASU. Since you\u2019ve already dropped/withdrawn, you won\u2019t be able to see those dates that I know of. \n\nI recommend checking your Finances tab in the morning to see if it has removed the tuition and fees.",

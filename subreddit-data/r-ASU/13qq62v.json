    "postText": "I am an incoming freshman this fall and scored very bad on my math placement test due to not taking calculus in a year and not remembering it. My major math is in the middle range of scores but my score is below that range. Does anyone know if they will still put me in my major math or will I have to take whatever math i score in to? \n\ni plan on retaking the test today after reviewing some but i am still worried i'll score badly",

If you don't already have AP credit for calculus you won't be able to override that placement score. Even though I had credit for calc I retook the test after going over material for about 3 hours and I went from like a 60 to an 85 or something like that (I had forgotten a lot of geometry and precalc since I hadn't taken it in a couple years).",

You'll just be miserable all semester and then potentially get a D or E and have to take it again. \n\nYou could also take the first classes on Universal Learner this Summer. They have Math through MAT210 or 265. You can take a class as a refresher for $25 or put the credit on your ASU transcript after completion for $425.",

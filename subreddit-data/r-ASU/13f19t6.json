    "postText": "Hi there! My application just went into review a few days ago, how long is the wait for a letter of admission/rejection? I'm so nervous and excited! I have a High School diploma and then about 22 college credits, would I be considered a transfer or a new freshman? I\u2019m worried because my high school GPA is great but my community college GPA is like 3 points lower than the listed minimum for transfer. Do I even have a chance?",

You need at least a [2.50 GPA](https://admission.asu.edu/apply/transfer/admission) to get admitted. If your GPA falls between 2.0 and 2.4 you can take advantage of the Earned Admission, or the [ULC](https://ea.asu.edu/) to bring your GPA up. However, you have to pay $425 out of pocket for every course. Once you completed and transcribed your ULC courses, you can apply if your GPA is above 2.5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. ASU has tightened its admission standards recently as I heard there are people getting denied from the Fulton Engineering Schools and/or the Barrett Honors College.",

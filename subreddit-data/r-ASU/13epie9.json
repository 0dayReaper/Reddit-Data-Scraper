ASU has like, double the amount of people who could be influencers. But that's already a pretty small amount. There are all sorts of people there.\n\nI'm 38 now but my friends who went there were all nerds, only two of whom were \"hot\". One was just slutty but that's enough to catapult a relatively thin blonde woman into hot status in college. They were all awesome but the rest of them were on a spectrum of normal to funny looking. \n\nI did Doordarsh around ASU on weekends the last two years and delivered to the regular kids just studying and staying in, but also saw the see-and-be-seens at clubs and out walking around. \n\nOP: Like, anywhere, it's a mix. Don't think about it. Be authentic, make the most of your education, because what really matters is that you get what you need out of that expensive degree. Life beyond college is so much more.

If you've been lifting since freshman year of HS, you'll be jacked when you're 20 or 21 in college. It's just how it is. A lot of people have varying workloads and also may have more time to lift. Some have easier majors like business or might not have a job or other responsibilities so they can genuinely put their all into lifting.\n\nI think realizing people are at different places helped me care less about where I stand physically at the moment.

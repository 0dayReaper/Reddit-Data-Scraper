            "comment": "Algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and possibly precalculus. It is an adaptive test so it only gets harder if you show you have the skills covered in earlier math subjects. You can take it 3 times. The general advice is to take it once and see how you score. It will tell you what you need to work on and even give you access to ALEKS learning tools while your testing window is open. Work on the areas that you need improvement and then take it again to improve your score. Using their tool also gives you more comfort with their testing UI for the 2nd test if you need it.",

    "postText": "So, my dilemma is that I am using TA funding and because of that I am only allowed to \"start\" two class per calendar quarter. Because of that and how classes are lining up I can either take PHY 121(class)/122(lab) at the same time, or split them up between A and B sessions, or (I like this idea better, but I need to know if it's dumb) take CHM 114 for A session, then PHY 121(class) for B session, then take PHY 122 (lab) during the summer session. Would a gap between the class and the lab be super detrimental?",

Just pull ur weight and ask questions as you need. Maybe read up on the lab concepts before class. Tho the thought of taking those SQ lectures as half sessions makes me want to faint lol.",

Just finished Calc 1 in a half session and I really wish I could of taken it as a full session lol. \n\nThanks for your input. \n\nI'm also curious how an online lab class would be. Guess I'll find out soon enough.",

Now I try to gather as much info as I can prior to speaking to my advisor. \n\n(FYI this decision is for spring/summer 2024, so I am still early on in the info gathering part of my decision. Still plenty if time to bring gathered info to my advisor)",

    "postText": "A nephew is 99 percentile in SAT, 4.8 weighted GPA, national merit scholar and lots of other commendable extra curricular activities. He had a risky strategy of applying to top 6 schools and ASU (he lives in AZ). He could not get in the top 6 and now is upset that he has to go to ASU. He has a feeling that ASU would be too easy for him and that it would not be challenging enough. Also, I think it hurt his ego that he was rejected by all top 6 in spite of all the hard work in high school. I want to talk with him and tell him that ASU can be a great place to learn and that he can make it challenging. How do I do that?",

I know a lot of top notch students (not me haha) who went to ASU for financial reasons. Some of them went on to do their masters at prestigious schools like Hopkin and UCLA. A few others went straight from undergrad to careers that make 180+. Is the the norm? No. But it\u2019s not impossible either. They\u2019re in the range of 23-26 now so this was recent too.",

Then they attended medical or dental school at Johns Hopkins, Harvard, USC, UW, and so on. I liked saving money in undergrad so that the huge price tag of a prestigious graduate/professional program is more reasonable.\n\nETA that there are many more diverse research opportunities available at ASU than say a more prestigious small liberal arts school in the Midwest. Upper division courses in some majors do have small class sizes at ASU and there\u2019s some very interesting electives offered.",

The most valuable education you get at ASU is what you teach yourself - for me; this was was academic research. At ASU, I was able to work part-time, research, volunteer, and still have plenty of time to devote to friends and relationships. At \"better\" schools you likely don't have that flexibility. If ASU is easy, great - devote that time to building experience towards whatever future career he wants.",

He may be right that ASU might not be challenging enough in the first year, but it also depends on what program he is in, what extracurriculars he is involved with, and how much time he dedicates to stuff outside of school. Because of my easier time at ASU as compared to my private highschool, I personally found a lot of time to further my passions, and to further my professional career (by starting a company).

I had the same thought \u201cASU will be too easy for me\u201d and after graduating this semester I admit that ASU was in fact not too easy for me. It was doable but very difficult at times. Career wise, getting into Google from ASU isn\u2019t really that impressive or rare anymore (many friends and I did it). As for positives, if he plays his cards right, he may be able to get to powerful leadership positions in important clubs which is a bigger high than than attending a top university IMO.

I was at a high performing computing conference this past week that is usually not even known to undergraduates.

Almost none of them had an ivy league on their name tag.\n\nDuring my time in the physics major and then the math major, I have had professors from Harvard, Brown, MIT, etc... They have made themselves approachable and work terribly hard for their students instead of their research.\n\nIf there is worry about ASU being easy, then better and more difficult classes need to be picked. If you try at ASU, there is more than enough to learn.\n\nTwo of my friends in the physics major will be attending MIT and Stanford for different areas of physics this next year as they pursue the PhD they desire.\n\nThere are well over 50k students at Tempe alone.

You can always get lecture notes from more \u201crigorous\u201d universities, take on self taught projects, and talk to your advisors about research credits or even grad credits, and publish some of this on a website that you can link on resumes. \n\nThere are some amazingly smart and talented people at ASU, and I\u2019m sure he will be one of them. It can even be a better opportunity to have more time to do things that he\u2019s interested in in his field. \n\nAnd honestly, failure, setback, and luck is a huge part of academic life. Remind him that his achievements are incredibly remarkable already, and that his choice of undergraduate school will mean nothing in the future if he is willing to put in work that shows he spent his time there as well as if he went to a top 6, either for future employers or future schools if he wants to transfer or go to grad school. \n\nReally long post, i know, but one last thing would maybe be to remind him that during his time, being a loner academic will not help, and that the connections he makes are 100% the most important part. \n\nEdit: Also, personally, I am so incredibly thankful that I chose ASU. The people I\u2019ve met, the classes i\u2019ve taken, and the experience i have had have hugely impacted me, and I would not have changed it for the world. \n\nBest of luck!!!",

I actually got in to Berkley which was my dream school at the time but I went to ASU because I got a full ride and it was the only one my family and I could make happen financially. I was feeling a little bit of that way but I was scared to admit it. Now, I\u2019m a Bio/Global Health double major headed into my senior year with a 3.96 unweighted and I love it here. \n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news because I know that at that age college is what his entire life has been headed towards, but from my understanding, where you get your undergraduate degree doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run. What matters is the opportunities provided to the students and who seeks them out. ASU is huge which means that it provides a lot of good opportunities for their students if you look them out. For example I\u2019m going into my 3rd year with my research lab this semester. This lab provided me the opportunity to be the youngest person to give a poster presentation at the national American Heart Association National Conference and I\u2019m working with my PI to get some of my work published. I\u2019ve also had an opportunity to volunteer during COVID and ended up being a member of the Student Outbreak Response Team, and now I\u2019m working with a group of students to genetically engineer a microbe to degrade micro plastics in our environment. \n\nI don\u2019t want make it seem like I\u2019m bragging, or some super genius, I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve been humbled by the classes and my classmates more times than I can count. I\u2019m just saying this to show that there are as many or more opportunities here at ASU than in other more prestigious universities but they aren\u2019t as pushed on us as the ivys. You have to put in the work to seek out and maintain those opportunities.",

I remember right from the very beginning taking introduction to engineering that I saw people drop and change majors and saw this up until my junior year.  At work management was very impressed with my curriculum and it got me a promotion 6 months before graduation.  Now when I talk to COOps, interns and new hires from other schools I feel like the SWE program at ASU was excellent compared to theirs. I am flying past these people because of what I was exposed to at ASU and I couldn\u2019t be happier.  If he wants a challenge ask him to consider a STEM program!",

Didn\u2019t get into either elite school, but not quite the same situation because I still wanted to go to the state schools I\u2019d applied to. But I initially said I would only go to ASU if I got into Barrett because I felt \u201cregular\u201d ASU wouldn\u2019t be academically rigorous enough. (I did go the Barrett route, and it was great for making friends, but looking back this was really unnecessary - however in his situation I would still recommend it as an option to make him feel better.) The second you start college you realize all the hype about elite colleges, Ivy Leagues, etc. doesn\u2019t matter. Even as \u201cjust\u201d a business major I was challenged by many of my courses, and this will be even more true in more traditionally rigorous majors like engineering or sciences. As I went through college I realized I wouldn\u2019t have even liked the more elite colleges; I appreciated being around people from all walks of life rather than mostly just wealthy privileged students, and I was glad I was at a school that didn\u2019t have that kind of arrogant/elitist culture. \n\nYou might want to ask him what the end goal is of having challenging academics. Is he learning just for the sake of learning, or is he trying to go to med school or other grad school, get a great career out of college, etc? ASU can be even better than elite schools for getting the type of experience needed to set yourself apart for grad school, the opportunities are endless.",

Barrett Honors has been called the blueprint for public honors colleges and is a respected program. Being Barrett gives access to Honors sections or added seminars, small Ivy style special topics courses, and you complete a thesis.\n\nMy daughter was admitted to Purdue and Tulane. She chose ASU Barrett due to cost at the other institutions, vs an almost free ride in AZ. She has never regretted that decision. She took advantage of every opportunity Barrett offered, had amazing professors, and loved living with others dedicated to excellence. In speaking to other Barrett parents, I've heard many stories of ASU Barrett alum being recruited because they are Barrett and even being told they are the only non-Ivy students being interviewed. The employers appreciate the choice to challenge yourself and complete a thesis as an undergrad. \n\nBarrett also offers many exclusive opportunities for research, study abroad, travel during breaks, and more. They partner with Mayo Clinic if Pre-Health and allow undergrads to take actual Law classes in Senior year if Pre-Law. The housing &amp; food is better too.",

I lived in the dorms and I met all sorts of interesting, smart people. There weren't as many options for honors classes as I would have liked (looks like there's more now!), but the ones I did take were uniformly amazing. Sometimes there are honors sections of regular classes, too. Honors physics was one of my favorite classes in my whole time at ASU.\n\nIn my experience, the Barrett faculty and administration were really responsive to the students. I vaguely remember going in to complain about some issues with the dorms (the honors college was housed in older buildings at the time -- you try powering a modern suite of electronics in a dorm that was built when one outlet was plenty!) And the reaction I got was, \"Oh, great! We're in the middle of designing a new dorm complex! Come give us your opinions!\" I never got to live in the new dorms, but I bet they're amazing.\n\nThe honors college gives you the small-liberal-arts-college experience in the middle of a large research university. It's the best of both worlds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeyond the honors college: ASU is a huge school and it really is what you make of it. Your nephew will have all sorts of opportunities to challenge himself. Does he know what he wants to major in yet?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding school choice: I get the ego blow, and I'm sorry. The top schools get all sorts of amazing applicants, and I think there's probably some luck of the draw involved. Your nephew might have been just as qualified as those who got in, but they don't take everyone, so they have to choose. In a different year, he might have been one of the lucky ones.\n\nAnyhow, I did get into my life-long dream school and turned it down to go to ASU because ASU offered me a really nice scholarship. It was a good decision, too, because I ended up too disabled to work full-time. I'd have had a lot of student loans that I couldn't pay off if I hadn't gone to ASU. Hopefully your nephew won't be in that kind of situation, but it will be nice to have more disposable income as a student, less need to work, and little or no student debt when he graduates.",

There are so many things to do and things you can get involved in that it can be challenging. There are so many research opportunities and that is what really helps with the challenge and allowing students to do real life applications.",

            "comment": "I was in a similar situation a few weeks ago actually lol. I got admitted to UW-Madison for Computer Science, and that felt like the prize at the end of all my hard work in high school (with a similar profile as your nephew). However, I soon came to realize multiple things:\n\n1. ASU costs half of what UW costs (I got scholarships and stuff, and since your nephew might be in-state, it will be even cheaper). Saving money in undergrad achieves many things, and having an extra $100K+ in ur bank account right after you graduate from college gives you A LOT of freedom.\n2. UW Madison had a letters and sciences program, while I wanted an engineering program.\n3. Unless you end up in Ivies/MIT/Stanford, the college you go to really does not matter. Additionally, ASU is a fantastic college. Moreover, everyone I asked said one thing - it's what you make of it.\n4. I know people with offers from top 10 colleges who are going/came to ASU for multiple reasons, so it would be highly irrational to think that ASU will be easy and that he would not have competition.\n5. Honors college. If you feel like you're not being challenged enough, sign up for Barrett in your second semester/second year.\n6. ASU is a good feeder college for Silicon Valley companies.\n7. ASU is much better weather-wise.\n\nAlso, regardless of all this, he has no choice rn but to attend ASU, so there is really no point in debating whether or not it will be good for him or not. Just try to blossom where you are planted.\n\nAll the best!",

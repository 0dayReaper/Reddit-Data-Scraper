I had a chance to still redeem 80% through a summer course grade replacement but that was gonna be a tall task for me. \n\nI\u2019m really surprised that ASU chose to do the right thing, but it gives me a lot more faith in the university and also legitimizes my feelings that this year was especially hard. \n\nI\u2019m over the moon right now.",

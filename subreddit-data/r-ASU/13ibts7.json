There is aviation transportation management which is really similar and saves you the money of having to pay for flight lessons",

Then you don\u2019t have rotc things to do while you\u2019re in school (I\u2019m pretty sure), and you get a stipend from them",

It\u2019s a grind for sure with early mornings and takes some dedication to get through. If you want to fly then it\u2019s the best way to do it. Message me if you want more info",

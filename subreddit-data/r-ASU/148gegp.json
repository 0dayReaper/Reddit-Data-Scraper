Track being the 6 classes to take on specific field like business analytics, math, computer science etc.\n\nI\u2019m a data science major and saw my graduation audit and I don\u2019t know which to take. I\u2019ve already been getting my butt kicked by classes and I just want to know if someone has any experience on the difficulties in the tracks.",

            "comment": "I'm in the Business Analytics track right now. One important thing to note....they don't say it in the degree audit, but you need CIS 105 to start the first of the 6 classes listed in the BA track. So be sure you budget the time for that and work it into your schedule plans. I'm in CIS 105 right now and it is so so so easy, but it is still something to be aware of. If you haven't already, I would go join the r/datascience subreddit. That said, if you post this question in there you may be disappointed as they really tout CS or Statistics undergrad degrees rather than DS and then specializing in DS in a masters program. I have 3 classes left of the core DS track and the 6 classes of the Business Analytics track left after this summer session to finish my degree. If you have any questions about classes up to that point feel free to message me.",

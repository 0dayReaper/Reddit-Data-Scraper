            "comment": "Throwaway account just so I can post this.\n\nTA here: Discussion boards are the biggest fucking joke. I personally despise them and have never used them in the courses that I have designed.\n\n* 97% of the time, no one ever bothers to go back and reply to the reply because......why should they? You both already earned your points. So it's not even a \"discussion.\" It's basically you giving a speech and a random audience member shouting \"hey, good job.\"\n* The reply isn't even given at a point in the writing process when it could be useful. You post your finished essay and someone chimes in with \"this is great, but I would have also talked about (insert obvious point you missed.\" And then you're sitting there like, \"Well no shit Sherlock. Now everyone *including the TA who will be grading this* is acutely aware of my paper's deficiency. A deficiency I have no opportunity to correct now.\" If the replies are posted *during* the writing process\u2014say after a rough draft\u2014then they can actually be useful to a degree.\n* For as much as we like being assholes to each other on social media, no one really wants to publicly disagree or critique someone else in an academic setting. Hell, even after a decade of teaching and TA'ing, I still get a small knot in my stomach when I realize that a student totally misunderstood the assignment and I have to let them know \"all of this is wrong and we need to meet up/email and rework this from the beginning.\" So I understand how awkward it is to provide meaningful feedback to a peer in such a \"public\" setting. In fact, the only time I've really seen a student post \"stimulate back-and-forth debate\" was two semesters ago when someone just flat out denied the Rwandan Genocide. If it takes genocide denial to actually get a discussion going, it's probably a poorly structured assignment in general.\n* Behind-The-Scenes-Grading-Tip: If you ask a question in your reply post, don't leave it rhetorical. Follow it up with your own thoughts on the subject. In other words, since 99% of your peers aren't going to ever follow up on whatever you ask them, use a question to segue into whatever you feel you can actually contribute or feel strongest about. If you don't have anything that's actually related to what they wrote, use a question as a way of steering your reply onto whatever you do want to say. I always let the students I am grading know this and when they use it I almost always give automatic full credit.\n* (Side note: I also like to let students know the order in how I review their work\u2014because almost *no one* grades an essay by reading straight through it. Depending on the specific rubric, I typically grade by checking: sources used &gt; overall length &gt; basic structure (usually 5-paragraph) &gt; thesis sentence (the intro paragraph also gives me a good idea of the general level of writing/vocabulary) &gt; quick scan through the body paragraphs checking citations and quotes &gt; second scan of the body paragraphs to evaluate the amount and quality of evidence used &gt; unless a bit of questionable analysis catches my eye, I move onto the conclusion &gt; unless the paper is specifically asking for students for something in their conclusion, this final paragraph almost never has any effect on the grade (unless it's juts flat out missing) &gt; I save the reply post for last because it gives me some wiggle room with the grade. If the grade is sitting at a 69 or 79 or 89, it's easy to add a point or two to the reply grade and bump it up to that next letter grade.)\n* Personally, as someone who has now sat through both an MA and PhD's worth of graduate seminar classes, real academic discussion is *rare* in most settings. It's commonly acknowledged that most of the \"discussion\" that takes place in those grueling 3-hour classes is more performative (trying to impress the instructor) than substantive (actually trying out new ideas or offering half-formed thoughts for peer input). One of the last courses I took actually experimented with a few different approaches specifically to get at this problem. It was only moderately successful. If a university or a department truly thinks that rigorous and engaged academic discussion is vital, then a better approach would be to open up the discussion boards. Create a Life Sciences forum, an English forum, a Philosophy forum, etc. and then create subforums for each course so that anyone enrolled in a department's forum can access and post in any related course. Have a question about adolescent development and psychology? Go post your question on that sub and give those students a chance draw from what they've learned and give substantive answers. Curious about a current event and want know its background? Go post on the relevant history sub and give those students a chance to wrestle with it. You wouldn't grade these boards according to a strict rubric, but you could easily offer some extra credit for students who participate or require that students make a half dozen posts per semester for a flat point total.\n\nAnnnnnnd there went 15 minutes when I should have been answering student emails. Ok, so are discussion boards completely useless? Not always. Some students actually do like them, but a lot don't and rarely do we get something substantive from them. I've seen some instructors make tweaks and use them in creative ways.",

Though it makes intuitive sense that graders can't logically read through an essay beginning to end and internalize all of it--that would just be to much to worry about--as a student it's disheartening to have poured your heart and soul into something, when nobody will actually read it.

It is usually pretty apparent when a paper is a work of passion. I can't speak for faculty or other TA's, but I'm almost always favorable to students who take a risk with an analogy or a quote from a popular TV series. It might not be \"strictly academic\" to compare something to Game of Thrones or Firefly, but I'm enough of a pop culture junky to usually make the connections and often they're quite good.\n\nThe real problem is the load that a lot of TA's face. We're *supposed* to not go over 20 hours per week with TA duties (because we still have our own course work, writing journal articles, doing research, dissertations, the expectation of attending most department events, meeting with advisors, etc.) but I've got 170 students that I'm grading for. If emails, troubleshooting, office hours, and *reviewing the course materials myself* takes 7-8 hours a week, that leaves me with roughly 4 minutes per essay to read, grade, and leave feedback. And it's not in writing anywhere, but the common expectation is that an efficient grader will not spend more than 3 minutes per essay.\n\nIt's insane.\n\nThere are outliers though. I TA'd for one professor who took grading incredibly serious and would spend 10-15 minutes per essay marking up everything and leaving paragraphs of feedback. That class also had the highest drop rate I've seen because a lot of students got discouraged from all the red ink. (Granted, the professor's thoroughness wasn't exactly balanced with kindness or gentleness.)",

                            "comment": "To a degree. I recently TA'd for a professor who had similar ideas and was very open minded. In fact, one of my personal crusades is that making a grading scale out of 1,000 points and then making only 1,000 points available discourages virtually all intellectual creativity/exploration and forces students to operate on the basis of FOMO. Why take a risk or try something new when any points you lose are gone forever?\n\nSo I was thrilled when this professor graded on a 1,000 point scale but made 1,200 points available in the course.\n\nWhere I actually had the most input was in the required \"intro to college teaching\" course. Unlike most of my peers who went straight from Bachelors to PhD, I taught high school for several years and served as the department chair. So I wasn't very shy in that class. (I was the only person with teaching experience\u2014though I usually limited myself four or five comments per class so that I wasn't that person dominating the discussion) Also, not to dox myself, but my career arc has been social work &gt; MA degree &gt; high school teacher &gt; PhD. So while I absolutely love my field, I do it because it gives me the chance to teach and invest in students' lives. I would tell y'all how much the intro to teaching class focused on the actual students......but I don't want to depress everyone. I will say, if you've had a professor who genuinely seemed to care about you and knew how to put everyone at ease and comfortable speaking up in class\u2014let them know you appreciate it because they certainly weren't taught those skills in their training. I'm all for better pedagogy and teaching methods, but the thing that gets overlooked so often is that effective, meaningful teaching is almost always built on the ability of the teacher to develop a sense of trust and mutual concern/respect with the students. If you walk into a classroom and within the first two minutes you can tell that the professor has invested in themselves (competency), is invested in the students (compassion), and loves the subject (passion)\u2014you're in for a great class.",

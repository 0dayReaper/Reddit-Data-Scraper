The fourth part is also online but will be interacting with your advisor (group or individual depending on the college). \n\nThe best thing you can do to prepare for the last session is to make sure you report full and accurate details about test scores, upcoming tests (like AP or IB), and any college credit you have already completed. That will help your advisor help you to get in the correct classes for the first semester. Also, be sure to take the Math Placement Test at least a week before the session with the advisor.",

Do you want it to be a touchscreen? Regular 15.6 inches or smaller like 14 inches? SSD or HDD? And once you've got all that figured out, just look for which model each brand carries that is closest to those customizations or specs, and then weigh the comparative prices with 1) the features and 2) the reviews and reliability reports.",

I have had Dell Latitudes (and supported them forever, they are not gaming machines, but will do your class work perfectly).\n\nIf you are the least but mechanically inclined, upgrading the storage (call it hard drive/SSD etc) and RAM is pretty easy.\n\nA 1TB SSD is ideal, Matlab and other software packages are huge.  2TB isn't a bad idea if it won't break the bank.\n\n16GB RAM should be the minimum memory.\n\nTowards the end of your second year, plan on buying a nicer new system to complete your last two years.",

I find myself reaching for my surface laptop 5 when it comes to these courses and their assignments. My recommendation would be the surface laptop 5 above all else. It is such a compact yet powerful machine so it is perfect for a student to travel with and great for coding IMO.",

The computer will do EVERYTHING a PC will and will run $1849.00 (plus 8.1% tax in Tempe).  That computer with 3-year or 4-year AppleCare (no service fees for repairs) will last all 4-years of college.  The 3-year AC runs $209.00 (no tax) and the 4-year AC runs $289.00 (no tax).  The AC quoted is what we sell to the university (better price and no repair fees).\n\nWe also have a certified repair center on campus in College Avenue Commons with no need to set appointments.  Repairs made at an Apple Store require an appointment and they tend pressure people to get new a computer (I don\u2019t need to as I sold $8-million in tech to ASU last fiscal year).\n\nIf you PM me, I\u2019ll give you my work email.  Tell me exactly what she needs and I\u2019ll write a formal quote.  I\u2019ll even ship UPS Ground for free if she wants it before August.",

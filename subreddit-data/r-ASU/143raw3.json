    "postText": " Hey everyone!\n\nOne of my friends and I are working on a project,\u00a0[https://admissions.fyi/](https://admissions.fyi/), that allows high school seniors to post their college admissions stats and what schools they applied to for underclassmen to look at and see what they need to do to get into their dream schools. We also offer a few cool tools like visualizations, summary statistics, and GPT powered profile searching, and are working on adding more features. We know that it\u2019s not possible and it\u2019s not our intent to replace subreddits like [r/applyingtocollege](https://www.reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege) as they serve as good forums to have conversations and offer/seek advice, but our hope is to make it far easier to share, view, and interpret college admissions results.\n\nRight now, [ASU doesn't have any data points](https://admissions.fyi/college/?OPEID=1000010) and we were looking to see if any students who applied within the last couple years would be interested in boosting that number up by submitting their data! It should only take a few minutes and would be super helpful not just to us, but to high school students as well. For full transparency, you will need to sign in to our website with your google account, but feel free to use a burner. All posted data points are anonymous and are used solely to help people get a better understanding of college admissions decisions.",

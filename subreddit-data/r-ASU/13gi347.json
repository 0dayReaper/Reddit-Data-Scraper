You'll tackle that the last 2 weeks(or that's how it was when I took it 2 years ago) if you haven't programmed before maybe do some leetcode? Best way to learn is to write cide and practice. Doesn't matter the language, most concepts carry between languages.",

Also maybe look into scheme/prolog (idk if those are still the other languages) if you get a chance, but they\u2019re pretty simple to learn in comparison.",

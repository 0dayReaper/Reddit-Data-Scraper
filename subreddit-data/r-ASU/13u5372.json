I\u2019ve also heard mixed reviews in person. Some people saying penkrot is better for 202 n others saying krupps. The only thing is that krupps would be more convenient for me since I am going to be living on Tempe, but I also don\u2019t mind traveling to Phx, if the professor is better on that campus. Some advice would be helpful",

Could I just add it without speaking to an academic advisor? Esp as someone who is going into my 1st year here this upcoming fall? I already do have a pretty loaded plate with my Finance major and the fact I have The Human Event on top of everything. Can I add this class? And if I can, would it be way too much work to do 22 credit hours my freshmen year?",

That will cover the G. \n\nWhat won\u2019t be covered in your major is C, so I would look for a Cultural course instead if you don\u2019t already have credit for one. Or if you don\u2019t have the two science courses complete, you could find a course for that. Just make sure that the lab is included on your schedule. \n\nAs you make these changes, be sure to check in with your academic advisor to have another set of eyes checking your selected classes.",

ENG302 and WPC480 cover the L requirements. Psy &amp; Soc cover the lower SB requirements. That leaves one upper HU or SB. SOC352 is a good option for that, but there's a lot of interesting classes out there too to choose from. REL320 is a nice option for WPC majors for the C class and is also an Upper HU. Take the SQ classes on Universal Learner unless you like science.",

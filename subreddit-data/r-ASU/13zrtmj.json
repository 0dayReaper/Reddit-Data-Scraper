            "comment": "Hi there:\n\nIn general, the grading scale varies across different classes and instructors. And you can view and download the syllabi from the [ASU Course Search](https://catalog.apps.asu.edu/catalog/classes). Note that some instructors use the plus-minus scale (the standard scale set forth by ASU), the others may only use the flat grades. Here are a few examples.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ACC 231 (west campus)**: [Plus-Minus Scale](https://webapp4.asu.edu/bookstore/viewsyllabus/2231/11361)\n\n* The cutoff of A+ tends to land between 97% and 99%.\n* A (92-98), A- (90-91), B+ (88-89), B (82-87), B- (80-81), C+ (78-79), C (70-77), and D (60-69).\n* Anything below 60% is an E (failing).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ECN 312 (tempe campus)**: [Plus-Minus Scale](https://webapp4.asu.edu/bookstore/viewsyllabus/2231/14868)\n\n* A+ (97-100), A (94-96), A- (90-93), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83), C+ (77-79), C (70-76), etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FIN 380 (tempe campus)**: [Flat Scale](https://webapp4.asu.edu/bookstore/viewsyllabus/2227/70220)\n\n* A (86-100), B (76-85), C (60-75), D (50-59), and E (0-49).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps!",

            "comment": "It truly does depend on the classes and major.\n\nI came from CGCC on the transfer degree (Associate in General Business) to go for a BS in Accountancy.  There was a lot of homework involved and studying for the next accounting classes.\n\nCan't remember much about the general business classes like FIN 300 , ECN 306, MKT 300, LES 305, MGT 300, but I finally did SCM in Fall 2022 semesters ago as I changed majors (need a 3.0 to change to another BS) and it was my last general for any business degree class.  \n\nSCM with Davila didn't really have any homework, but you had to read, know the stuff that he gave labs on and had to have really good study guides so it was super important to attend lecture because there were things that would only happen there that you were tested on.\n\nI just spent last semester doing CIS 315 &amp; CIS 355.  315 was very intensive.  Homework and Labs weekly and you had to actually attend class on lab days to get credit. 355 was easier.  You had to pay attention take good notes and fill out the study guides well but the homework was not too much, the quizzes were a few.  \n\nBoth classes were weighted that the bulk was based off the hw/lab/quiz and made enough of a difference that if you did well in those you would do fine even if your midterm and final were 40%.\n\nNot looking forward to Fall as I have CIS 325 and I am really weak when it comes to programming but hopefully the class I am taking along with it won't be too intensive so that I can spend extra time on the 325 class.\n\nI think classes at the community college level are a bit easier but partly because the classes are smaller and professors on the whole don't have the amount of students that ones at ASU have..\n\nIf you have more questions or want clarification, DM me.\n\nHope this answer helps somewhat though.",

I know many people who received it last year heard back around mid April last year but I don\u2019t know anyone who has heard back yet. Anyone have any updates?",

On that page there\u2019s a little tan that says something like status and it\u2019ll say there whether it\u2019s currently being reviewed, or if it was accepted/rejected (it may say closed I don\u2019t remember exactly)",

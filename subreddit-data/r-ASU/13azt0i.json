    "postText": "I've been unable to get the cap, gown and tassel due to its cost affordability. If you have already purchased your cap and gown, I would be grateful if you would consider renting it out to me for the day(10th May) for a fee. I promise to take good care of it during my ceremony on 10th May. Please let me know if you would be willing to rent out your cap, gown and tassel, and we can work out the details. Your help would be greatly appreciated. \\[Just for the record, my height is 5'11\\]\n\nTrying out my luck here \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb  \n\n\nEdit: Found it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc. Thank you for reading.",

In 2016 I joined after being nominated while I was still attending Mira Costa Community College but I still haven't completed all of the steps to be inducted and haven't been more involved like I should be. The benefits are that they offer discounts, scholarships, a job bank where you can search for jobs and apply etc. The links below are to the National Society of Leadership and Success website and to the National Society of Leadership and Success Facebook group page. To join the Facebook group you will need to be a member. You can also use the facebook group page to start or find a Success Networking Team to join so that you can complete the Success Networking Team step.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.nsls.org/](https://www.nsls.org/)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/thenslsofficial/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/thenslsofficial/)",

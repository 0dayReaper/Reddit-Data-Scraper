Oh and should i mention that the new thesis, with no course on outline, will have to be done in 7 weeks?",

If you don\u2019t get anywhere with them or they are the instructor you are having issues with, then it\u2019s time to contact someone higher in MLFTC.",

Don't go straight to a dean, as their first question will be whether you followed the chain I suggest, and if you haven't, they'll just ask you to do so.",

Someone trying to cut ahead is likely going to get sent backwards and lose some time. The time loss matters less in the spring because students have all summer, but most fall disputes need to be resolved before May. \n\nFurther, grad students often need to be a bit more circumspect and careful than undergrads. Going nuclear on a grade appeal makes it unlikely the prof will write a recommendation for future stuff, and grad students need those recs and support more than most undergrads do. That fact doesn\u2019t mean grad students should never appeal grades, but skipping ahead to the most confrontational posture is short-sighted.",

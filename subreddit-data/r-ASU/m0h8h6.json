Like yea we get \u201ca day off\u201d but that would just cause teachers to make things due the next day. So instead of taking a day off, students will just be doing the work that\u2019s due the next day or the day after. \nAnd I know that the solution could never be perfect, not everyone follows the rules and colleges might not always have the best ideas, but in-person is opening up next semester, so like...that should be fun.",

I\u2019m not saying ASU is the worst, I\u2019m just saying that there are definitely departments that suck. Our math and physics departments come to mind. Also the way they have handled fall break and spring break during Covid has been dumb. With all the classes online, students can literally travel all they want as long as they are in class for the lectures and doing homework. Students traveling and not following Covid restrictions were their main reasons for cancelling and they didn\u2019t actually prevent that. Now there is an entire body of students that are more burnt out than normal. So congrats to them for being \u201cstill pretty good\u201d academically.",

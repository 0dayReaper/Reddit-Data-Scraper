Doors would open on their own, elevator to all floors, including the parking lot. \n\nHallways were wide enough for him and so were the apartment doors. The showered are just showers, no tubs so very easy for him to get into.\n\nThe open concept of the whole place really helped him get around!",

They seem to not want to enforce building codes, nor do the bare minimum to make their traffic lights safer (with leading pedestrian signals).\n\nAlso I don't think I've seen a single person in city hall. Ever.",

I'm not sure if it's a standard setting and I don't really recommend living there (had very bad interaction with the management), just FYI.",

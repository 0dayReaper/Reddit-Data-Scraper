For the most part the bigger parties are in Tempe so you\u2019ll typically be asked to come down to Tempe. Parties in polytech are usually more small gatherings, but they\u2019re a lot more common (there isn\u2019t a *ton* to do over by polytech without going a decentish distance so a lot of people just throw small dorm/apartment kickbacks)\n\nAnother option honestly, go through your dorm and ask people if they\u2019d want to meet up to go to a movie! There\u2019s a movie theater not too far away from campus and you can always talk about going dorm shopping at the Walmart/target right down from the movie theater too. It can be rough to connect with people but most people are in the same boat so a good amount of people would likely love to connect with you and have someone to go shopping with for the start of the semester.\n\nLike I briefly mentioned polytech is an interesting place and you kinda have to go a bit farther out for some of other stuff to do, but these are definitely a few options that would probably help connect with people!",

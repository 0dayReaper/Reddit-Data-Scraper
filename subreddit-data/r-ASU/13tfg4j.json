I\u2019m in aerospace engineering and have been trying to get an internship that\u2019s local but have been struggling. Is there a place at ASU that actually helps? Or is this more of a solo venture?",

I mostly asked older friends/graduates for advice and then mock interviews.",

Students can usually internship for credit through a professor doing research or aiding them. I\u2019m doing that for microbiology and it\u2019s a great resume booster and nice clears out a chunk of upper division credits.",

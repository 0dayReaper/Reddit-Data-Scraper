    "postText": "I\u2019m a 21 year old college student from California. I\u2019m going into this fall semester turning 22. I went to a community college since graduating high school and covid robbed me of the traditional college experience. How can i experience the traditional fun college experience transferring to ASU from cali? Is it awkward trying to experience college as a 22 year old when most of the students in frats, and such, are 18-20? I\u2019m also a gay guy, so i\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any place i can go to hang out or make friends? I know Arizona isn\u2019t as lgbt friendly as California is or there isn\u2019t as many gay guys my age, but ASU is good for gay students, right? Would frats consider me if i chose to rush given the fact that i\u2019m not an 18 year old freshman or straight?",

There\u2019s a lot of support on campus, clubs, Rainbow Convocation, etc. You\u2019ll be able to network with people who are supportive.",

Phoenix is the least liberal since it's so big and has grown so much it has basically swallowed up the conservative outskirt communities. Look at the Congressional districts and you'll notice that downtown Phoenix and Tempe are pretty strong blue. Phoenix hosts Phoenix Pride Parade and Festival every year in spring and is home to the Melrose District, the Phoenix gayborhood where there are always street festivals and events.\n\nASU has a ton of LGBT student clubs and they even host Drag Shows once a semester. Look up the ASU Rainbow Coalition on Instagram, they're the organization that oversees and promotes the LGBT clubs.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am currently a Masters in Computer Science student at ASU's SCAI department.\n\nI came here in Fall 22 and am wanting to graduate in December 2023. Hence, I shall have to apply for course overload at SCAI's advising department.\n\nDoes anyone know about three things:\n1. The deadline\n2. The GPA cutoff required to be considered\n3. When will I hear back about this from my department (whether or not I got approved)\n\nI would very highly appreciate your help in this regard.\n\nRegards",

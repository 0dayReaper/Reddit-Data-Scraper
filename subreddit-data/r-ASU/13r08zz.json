    "postText": "I was able to barely scrape my A past MAT 210 last semester, I studied maybe 5 or 6 hours before exams and generally did well (I did take a fairly big hit on my grade when my final was graded, but I was too lazy to study for that in all fairness)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've heard that 211, especially with Abramson's Hybrid class, is easier than MAT 210? Is this true?\n\nI'll be very busy this semester so a lighter workload for my Math than last semester would be a godsend...",

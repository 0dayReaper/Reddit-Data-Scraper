That was probably the best experience for me as it was small class sizes and allowed me to meet some good friends that I still chat with to this day as well as it being $725 for 12 credits and the college experience.  After the Fall semester started I began to get more and more distracted with the freedom that college gave me and less focused on the education portion, not necessarily parties but the ability to sleep in and not be noticed if I missed a class.  This eventually got worse and I lost more motivation.  I failed a few courses and ended up taking a withdraw from a semester in 2011.  During the Fall semester of 2011 I started working full time doing IT work and that took my entire attention away from school as it was good money (at the time) and I thought I didn\u2019t need a degree.  Fast forward two years and I received a promotion to Supervisor, then  three years after that I was promoted again to Manager.  This is when my Director sat me down and reinforced the importance of a college degree, not just for the diploma but for the degree process offering a different level of thinking.  I started taking a few online courses after reapplying and just kept at it to make sure I finished and was debt free as well.\n\nI think overall I was just very immature when I started college and didn\u2019t really take it seriously.  It took some real world experience to realize that if I wanted to keep climbing the career ladder I needed to continue with my education.  It also helped me find a career path I am passionate about, which was not my original degree path.",

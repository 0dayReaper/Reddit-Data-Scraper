(There are 3 liberal/arts colleges at ASU and the function differently on the various campuses). \n\nIf you are still in the application process, you can contact Admissions to ask for the change in campus. If you\u2019ve already been admitted and are enrolled in classes, then you can just contact a College of Liberal Arts and Sciences advisor to discuss changing over to the Tempe Sociology major. \n\nAlso, maje sure to consider if there may be any impacts to your financial aid in making the switch to your campus.",

I stopped talking to him because of it. He even laughed at me over a Skype interview when I attempted to explain my education goals. Not a good experience at all. \n\nAnyway, he's no longer an advisor at ASU, and I have someone new. Haven't spoken to her yet, but hopefully she will at least listen to me and not laugh at me.",

High turnover means having advisors who (on the whole) have little training or institutional knowledge. They wouldn't know if a class was hard or if taking x and y together might not be a good idea. Continuing with low pay and high caseloads perpetuates this cycle.",

I learned this past semester that I need an extra year (5th year) because I was missing one prerequisite needed for the capstone program that starts exclusively in the fall. The prereq I needed is only offered in the spring. I met with my advisor for a mandatory meeting in October. Apparently, this meeting was supposed to be to ensure that I'm signed up for all the classes I need to graduate on time, but instead we talked about grad school, scholarships, and the teachers college. My advisor never once mentioned that I absolutely needed to sign up for this one class. Advisors are required to send a summary email which lists a suggested course layout for the coming semesters (still no indication of the importance of prereqs in the email). Come class sign up in March, I found out that I can't sign up for capstone... I made an appointment with my advisor (same advisor) and asked to be let into the prereq late (I've heard of professors doing this for students before, and one of my current professors at the time was doing it) and received total pushback from my advisor. As soon as I asked, she said \"See this is why we meet with you in October to make sure you've signed up for those prerequisites...\" Every single time I meet with my advisor (even mandatory meetings), it's \"What do you want to talk about today??\" In a meeting in March, she tried pushing me down a path to get simultaneous teacher certification as well as a scholarship through AZ Teachers Academy. A 5-minute Google search showed me that I don't qualify for it, and I would have to do student teaching before actually taking the teacher classes which I'm pretty sure is not allowed.\n\nI like being in school, and I don't mind spending an extra year, I just want to walk at graduation with everyone alongside me. What really ticks me off is the fact that this fuck up is costing my dad an extra $10k for two four-credit (capstone) classes (we recently dropped $170k due to medical debt), and I'm an out-of-state student so tuition is NOT cheap. Formerly, I was thinking about attending the teachers college at ASU for a Masters as the education is better than most other schools, but I don't think I want to do that anymore. Not to mention my experience in classes hasn't been the best... At this point, I don't want to attend ASU any longer than I have to. I'd really like to make a complaint to the dean or head of the advising department or something but I fear that everyone I complain to will tell that that's the way it is.\n\nOn a side note... I have a friend who is a math major in the same year as me. She's failed class after class repeatedly (failed calc 2 twice, calc 3 t times, etc.). At ASU at least, in many majors, if you fail a class more than twice, they make you change your major. I guess that's not the case for the math department because her advisor has gotten her into class after class that she's failed. It's frustrating to hear that her advisor will go to bat for her, and mine won't even try to help me outside of giving high-level suggestions, opportunities that I won't qualify for, or failing to communicate important information.",

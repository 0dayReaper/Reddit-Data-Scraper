    "postText": "I just finished my bachelors and have been exploring options for graduate programs when I found the Biological Data Science Masters that ASU offers. It seems to be a newer program so not a lot of anecdotal information to be found online. I had some questions and wanted to just hear from students how they feel about the program. I included my specific questions below, but I\u2019d appreciate any info you\u2019d like to share. I\u2019d also be interested in the opinions of graduate students in other programs!\n\nCan the program be completed in a year? I understand how the terms work - 6 x 7.5 week terms (or 6 weeks in summer I guess). The program appears to have a total of 12 classes, so it seems I could take 2 classes per term and finish in a year. However, I don\u2019t know how the prerequisites work, so that could cause it to run longer. \n\nIs taking two graduate courses at the same time reasonable? That\u2019s pretty much what I expected to do but the website was a bit vague if that\u2019s what most students did. \n\nMy bachelors is in Geoscience, but I did a minor in biology. Biology was my first major in college so I don\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll struggle with that aspect, but I never took the upper-level courses. I also have relatively limited experience in programming. I\u2019ve taken Intro to Python and Statistics in Python, but wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m proficient with it yet. The website says that the program is suitable for basically anyone with a bachelors, but would my relative lack of experience in these areas prevent me from succeeding in this program? \n\nI hope to eventually get into a role working with environmental data, rather than strictly biological. Would this program be suited for that, or does it have more of a biomedical focus? I was noticing classes like Human DNA that wouldn\u2019t be helpful, but they must have other options for an ecology focus? \n\nThanks if you took the time to read this, it was way longer than I expected. The enrollment counselor I was assigned has NOT been helpful so I\u2019m grateful for any insight.",

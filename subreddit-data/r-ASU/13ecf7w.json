    "postText": "Hi guys, I recently got admitted to ASU's Robotics and Autonomous Systems. I was filling my visa application then I came across a section that asked for course of study, as per my i20 course of study includes numbers. This got me confused should I just fill the course name or should I also includes the numbers. I tried contacting ASU regarding this but they are taking too long to respond and visa slot booking are going to open in a day or two. So I need this information asap. Thanks in advance.\n\nCourse name as per i20: Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering 14.4201",

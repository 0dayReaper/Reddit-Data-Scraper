You assume that ALL of them are not hard workers due to statistical majority. I've know people that have had below 3.0 GPA to go on and be successful in their respective careers. GPA doesn't always mean you are smart or capable. The education system as a whole is a terrible way to judge someone for what they are capable of. A lot of people just have a harder time learning in different settings. Doesn't mean they are less intelligent than others. \n\nHell, people are even successful outside of going to college. You can't judge someone on their skills just because of something as insignificant as GPA.",

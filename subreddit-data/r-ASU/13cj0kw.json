    "postText": "I'm an incoming freshman and because of my SAT score I'm eligible to take ENG 105 which i figured was fine cuz i don't mind english. I have to take it spring semester 2024for some reason. I was just wondering if it was exceptionally harder than taking 101 and 102. I don't rly have much of a choice but wanted to see what i'm in for in the spring. Thnx",

            "comment": "ENG 105 is the accelerated version of the First-Year Composition that combines ENG 101 and ENG 102 into one semester. The pacing is faster but the content is pretty standardized by the English Department. As long as you utilize the Writing Center, attend classes regularly, and submit all assignments on time then you'll pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*P.S. Please follow the rubric when drafting your essay, lots of instructors will grade your essay based on the rubric*.",

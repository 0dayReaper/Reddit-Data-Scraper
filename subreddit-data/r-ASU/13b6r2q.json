            "comment": "Hi there:\n\nThe BAE Educational Studies does not lead to teacher certification as other MLFTC major programs do. When I applied to ASU as a transfer student, I mistakenly selected the Educational Studies program instead of the Secondary Education program. I successfully switched back to Secondary Ed in the past December. However, here are a few things that will make your dream work:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Option 1** \\- Since Educational Studies students cannot add the secondary/elementary education certificate into their degree, you can added a minor that aligns with your academic interest. That is, if you want to become a history teacher, then add a history minor. However, graduating with an Educational Studies degree won't give you the certificate. You probably need to get a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) to be eligible for teaching.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Option 2** \\- If you're still in your first or second year, you can change your major to either Secondary or Elementary education major programs. Credits earned in EDT 180, TEL 111, TEL 212, TEL 215, and other education classes will automatically apply to the new degree programs since most education students take those classes during their first 2-3 semesters. The only restriction is that once you changed your major program, you must attend classes in-person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Option 3** \\- Some colleges and schools offer major programs that will give you teacher certification upon graduation. For example, [History](https://shprs.asu.edu/degree/undergrad/ba-history-secondary-education), [English](https://thecollege.asu.edu/degree/undergrad/ba-english-secondary-education), and [Mathematics](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major/ASU00/LAMATSBS/mathematics-secondary-education) have the options for secondary teaching endorsement. Those programs are mostly in-person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor additional information, the best way is to schedule an appointment with your advisor and make alternative plans. I hope this helps!",

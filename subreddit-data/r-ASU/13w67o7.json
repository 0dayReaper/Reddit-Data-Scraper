So for instance, if the first question was 2+2 and you got it right, the next question might be 2x6, so slightly harder. If you get that right, it keeps increasing. If you get things wrong, it goes back down. But the tests will always start easy and then increase with difficulty. The system doesn't take your other tests into account, it just starts out the same for everyone.",

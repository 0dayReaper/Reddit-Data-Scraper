Don't take classes 'just because' - if anything take a year off and really do some soul searching to find out what you want to be doing for the next 40+ years. There's no rush. College will still be there. Do you want to teach? That's cool, but just know that most teachers struggle to get by on their $30,000/year salaries. Do you want to get a PhD? That's cool too, but be prepared to be in school for the next 12+ years. There are pros and cons to everything. You don't want to graduate and then have no job or be making minimum wage and then have to start paying back student loans too.   Another tip: get an internship while you're in school! It makes finding a job 10x easier post-graduation.",

Also, since you like math look into becoming an actuary. It\u2019s an overlooked career field with a ton of great benefits. You can make some good money once you pass all the professional exams and/or become employed with an insurance company. You\u2019ll never have to worry about finding a job. ASU even has a degree in Actuarial Science. Check it out!",

If so i would definitely recommend looking into engineering if you haven\u2019t already. Idk what the math curriculum is like but I\u2019m a junior in mechanical engineering and it\u2019s obviously very math/physics heavy and it has some of the best job prospects of any major out there with great salaries. Because again idk exactly but I\u2019m pretty sure math is very similar to bio in the sense that you need at least a graduate degree to do much of anything, but i could be wrong. Just another avenue of thought",

    "postText": "Hello! I'm approaching senior year as a CS student and came in during COVID year, so I didn't get much of an opportunity to reach out and meet a whole lot of other majors. I've played music my whole life and studied jazz back home in Nashville, but I can't find any places to meet musicians who would want to play together. I'm looking for open clubs, jams, or if anyone here knows people looking for a bass, guitar, or drum player, or a vocalist. I just want to meet musicians! Anything helps!",

    "postText": "I know consulting the internet perhaps isn't the best call, but I figured I'd like to see what others have done. I am taking advantage of the SCAP program, online, and decided to be full time over Summer. one of the biggest reasons being I withdrew from one class previously and had to retake another. The thing is, one of the classes I'm thinking I don't want to take in the Summer A session. It's interesting, and while I definitely think I could pass it and whatnot, I don't think I'll really Gain anything from it. It's not required for my degree whatsoever. And at this point, with my mental health and life events, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to withdraw from one class and end up being kinda part time for the Summer instead.\n\nLike I said, the class isn't terrible to me necessarily, but I kinda just don't know if I want to do it for a few weeks. The setup kinda bothers me, as it forces me to work on it every other day, while I like doing my schooling in 3-4 days per week if possible. I'm almost a Sophomore in college now and only have withdrawn from one elective class. Do y'all think that would be okay to have another withdrawal so soon? What have y'all done? I don't think it would screw over my financial plan, but I'm not sure. I also have debated on straight up quitting Starbucks and possibly the college plan, as I have been doing what I've been for about a year, but I'm usually kinda miserable.\n\nI got a little off track there, but any thoughts or comments would be appreciated; personal decisions that influenced your choices perhaps.",

That may trigger you having to pay back those if you drop below the threshold.\n\n&gt;with my mental health\n\nI don't know if you just mean you are overwhelmed or have a disability related to this.  If you do have disabilities, you might see if you qualify for use of SAILS and accommodations that will allow you to be successful no matter the class or time frame.\n\nBest of luck either way fellow Sun Devil!",

If you don\u2019t think you need it and it doesn\u2019t do anything for your degree progress and you want to focus on other things than why not? I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it",

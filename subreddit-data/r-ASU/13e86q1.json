You have to have 1000 lifetime deliveries, and then meet monthly delivery quotas.  It can be done in as few as 17 deliveries per month if you do it during dinner time which they denote as 5pm - 9pm.  To be conservative, you can do at least 2 deliveries an hour and usually more, so getting to the 1000 lifetime deliveries can take a couple of months, but if you work really long hours you could get there quicker.",

It all depends on your major and how much of a self starter you are. I personally believe asynchronous courses are far easier than in person because I like to do things on my own time and not drive to campus. Probably to start id take 2 classes in a session to see how you feel then amp it up if it is easy or difficult",

I usually work 20-30 hours. I got a 4.27 GPA.\n\nFor math classes (MAT 210 and 211) and science classes (i.e., physics), I would recommend taking them by themselves for the session. They're starting to eliminate any session C courses in the fall.\n\nMAT 210 and 211 should really be session C. It's pretty evil what ASU is doing. The pace is too fast for sessions A and B.\n\nMAT 211 required like 20-30 hrs of work per week easily. Shit was rough. Pretty much an all or nothing class. You had to give it your best and hope you pass. If you didn't give your best, you risked failing or getting a low grade, lol. I miraculously ended up with an A.",

I think the information in MAT 210 is easier than MAT 211, but I can see pace being a major issue. MAT 211 is a survey of Calculus 3, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, and Probability. \n\nI watched the Organic [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor) and [Professor Leonard](https://youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard) to learn the concepts in MAT 211. Helped a ton.\n\nIf you take a second class with MAT 210 or 211, I would highly recommend you take it with a super easy Gen Ed.",

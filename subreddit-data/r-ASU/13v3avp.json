IT IS CHEAPER, but IDK about transferring those credits back to your ASU transcripts. \n\nMy opinion is this: this is what the core of obtaining a college degree is all about, showing you're able to learn difficult stuff and overcoming adversity. If you want to pass this class, you need to study hard, inside and out. Form study groups, go to office hours. Get feedback on quizzes or exams. Holding yourself accountable for your failures and properly managing your time. \n\nYou do this, you should pass easily. You don't, you can fail again. That'll be a hassle and a waste of money.",

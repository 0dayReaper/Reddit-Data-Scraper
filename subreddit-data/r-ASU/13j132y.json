Make sure that it\u2019s a legitimate thing and I would probably call twice or three times this week to get different people to all tell you the same thing. \n\nAccidents happen more often than breaks from schools so I would 100% investigate this further",

I saw I received an email from them stating they rewarded me that just cause I was graduating, done in good faith and that was all there is to it. Hoping that's the case for you too!

No clue how, but I logged into myASU one day and it was 0 and listed an emergency grant for the full amount. I\u2019m guessing it going to your bank account was just an accident.",

If you have your bank account set up in your myASU finances tab to receive refunds, rather than paper checks, then they would have deposited any leftover financial aid money as a refund. When you log into my ASU and click on the finances tab, you should be able to find a list of your transactions. If it's not clear after checking your account online, then contact the financial aid department at ASU. If any of your financial aid included a loan, but it wasn't needed for you tuition so they gave you a refund, one tip I can offer you is to use that refund to make your first loan payment or use it for an extra payment to reduce your interest.",

You should have a zero balance or extra if some funds were not used. \n\nNow, I have a warning for private loan borrowers: Don't trust them!\n\n Right now they want me to transfer funds to a different account, an account that the government needs to reduce federal loan for working in a state/educational facility - based on how long. That's because they had more principal going to federal (the lower rate at that time) and paid that off first.. If I do that I'll still owe - allot - but at the new Fed rate and then Navient will do their dirty work to make money off of this.\n\nAlso, I would not get anything waved if Bidens plan went through because if Navients trick. Also, I had a different lender to begin with and it was sold several times over to different lenders",

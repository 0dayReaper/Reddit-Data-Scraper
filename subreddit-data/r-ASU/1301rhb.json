I\u2019ve been wanting to have some sort of horror movie/art/literature club to talk about cool creations in the genre. Is this something people would be interested in? Does it already exist? Is it difficult to start a club like this? I\u2019d like to hear from someone who\u2019s led/started a recreational club \nThxxx \ud83d\udc7b",

    "postText": "Alright, this seems like something I need to write up, given that you guys, especially the Freshmen, are going to drink regardless. But this post is hopefully going to prove helpful in keeping you all safe so that we don't lose any lives or have anyone getting hurt. \n\n1. **Eat and drink** before you start consuming alcohol, you should not drink on an empty stomach.\n\n2. Pace yourself. You might be pounding shots left and right and feel fine...until it catches up with you and you're on the floor.\n\n3. ***Any drink you did not see poured is not safe to drink***\n\n4. If you put a drink down, go to the bathroom or something, and come back, ***That drink is no longer safe to drink***\n\n5. Going to a party? Bring a friend or two or seven. \n\n6. Most CAs/Police/etc... don't care about you drinking and won't come looking for you unless you're being loud or doing something stupid. I've seen people pointing laser pointers out of windows in a cop's eyes at Vista before...it's dumb and they're going to find you. \n\n7. Keep your stuff generally hidden if you keep it in your dorm. ASU is a dry campus, and if maintenance or someone else comes through and there's bottles out they can report it. Maintenance generally doesn't care, but if a CA walks by while you're talking to someone in your door way and there's a bottle of jaeger on the table...you're screwed.\n\n8. You do not have to open any cabinets or anything similar if a CA asks you, but they will go get a community director to do it if you refuse. \n\n9. ***IF SOMEONE IS NON-RESPONSIVE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, TAKE THEM TO THE HOSPITAL*** Them throwing up will not reduce their BAC, it'll just stop more alcohol from getting into their blood. If someone is non-responsive, they need to go to the hospital. **Even if you're underage, good samaritan laws keep you safe if you call 911 to save someone else.**\n\n10. Do not join any organization that pressures you into any form of alcoholic hazing. Most organizations have wised up and knocked that off, but your life is not worth one night of excessive drinking. \n\n11. Pedialyte is your best friend, it'll replenish your electrolytes and make the hangover less bad. Create a hangover starter kit for the next morning with food and whatnot because you won't want to do it in the morning.\n\n12. ***GET CONSENT.*** If someone is obviously drunk, take care of them, do not take advantage of them. Beyond the fact that it's a terrible thing to do to someone, you could severely damage their mental health because that is quite literally ***RAPE***, but you could face prosecution and jail time. Being a decent human should be enough motivation, but you could quite literally end your life via criminal charges if you don't get consent. Even if the other person pulls the \"I regret last night, it was rape\" thing, verbal consent helps protect you in case they decide to attempt to report you for that. It's not rape, but it can severely hurt you publicly and legally.\n\n13. In general, I would say don't mix sex and alcohol at all to prevent any blurred lines, but you guys will really do what you want so please use common sense.\n\n14. **IF YOU ARE GOING HOME WITH SOMEONE OR GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE/LEAVING A PARTY WITHOUT YOUR FRIENDS, LET THEM KNOW. SOMEONE SHOULD KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES**\n\n15. Bonus: If you're meeting someone from Tinder/Grindr/Bumble/What have you, meet them in a public place first just to be safe. \n\n16. ASU is a dry campus and your body is a container. If you're of legal age and are walking through campus drunk, you're still violating ASU policy and can get screwed by standards. \n\n17. Have a game plan for how you're getting home. Who is calling the uber? Where is it dropping us? Who is staying sober enough to communicate? Generally, people at the party will help you out if you're too intoxicated, but having a plan in place stops panicking and makes things go smoother.\n\n18. Know your limits, if you're 5'2\" and 100 lbs, you're not going to go shot for shot with someone who is 6'4\" and 250 lbs, you don't have to try and keep up, that'll just ruin your night when you hit the floor. \n\n19. Throwing up is fine, but it's not going to save you from alcohol poisoning. Again, it doesn't lower blood alcohol content, it just stops more in your stomach from entering the blood to a small extent.\n\n20. After you throw up, do not brush your teeth right away, the acid will erode your teeth in addition to the brush grinding away at them. Drink some water, wait a bit, gargle water, and then either use mouthwash or brush your teeth. \n\n21. Set a budget, drinking is expensive, especially if you're 21 and are going to Mill, it is very easy to drop $50+ a night if you're not paying attention. Pre game if you have to (just not too hard)\n\n22. Don't be afraid to call someone to help you, good friends will prioritize your life over their sleep if you're in danger. \n\n***RESOURCES***\n\nA note from ASU PD:\n\n\"Remember to keep doors shut and locked. Do not prop doors open as this can pose a security risk. Call 911 in case of emergency. \n\nSee 911 FAQs. Download the free ASU LiveSafe mobile app. Use emergency call boxes available on each campus that are identified by a bluepole with \u201cEmergency\u201d printed on it or by a bright yellow box on a metal pole. Look for the blue light directly above each pole or box at night. Read more Do not walk alone at night.\n\nUtilize the SafeWalk feature in the ASU LiveSafe mobile app or contact the Safety Escort service on the Tempe campus by calling **480-965-1515**. Or, call ASU Police to ask for an escort at **480-965-3456**. On the West campus, call **602-543-3456**; the Downtown campus, call **602-496-3456**; and the Polytechnic campus, call **480-727-3456.** Read more. Always remain alert and aware of your surroundings, and trust your instincts. If a situation feels unsafe, take appropriate safety precautions. Report any unusual or suspicious activity you witness. \n\nIf you witness a crime, be prepared to give a full description\u2026. Suspect(s) - Gender/Race/Hair/Approximate Age/Clothing/Weapons Vehicle(s) - License Plate/Color/Year/Make/Model/Direction of Travel If someone with a weapon demands your property, surrender it and contact police as soon as possible. \n\nReport crime to ASU Police in person, by telephone **480-965-3456** or email. If you would like to report a crime but do not wish to reveal your identity, you may contact **ASU Police at 480-965-3456 or 480-965-TIPS.\"** \n\n______________________________________________\n\n[ASU Counseling Services](https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling)\n\n______________________________________________\n\nASU staff members are largely mandatory reporters, if you wish to disclose something to them, including many student workers, they will have to report anything that happens, or they can direct you to anonymous reporting options such as the ASU PD Anonymous Tip Line. \n\n_______________________________________________\n\nI'll add more to this later, but I am currently hungover.",

Drinking more wont make you \"feel better.\" People chase that feeling just end up trashed and cant control themselves. That's actually a fast way to black out too. Once you feel loose and good, have a glass of water and wait 20 mins then have a drink. Repeat each hour, and you can pretty much ride the wave and not have to deal with a hangover usually.",

IMO a double major is a waste of time and money, but if you want to do something that won\u2019t make ur schedule too full. \n\n\nThere are other aspects to college than classes that could better boost future job prospects.\n\nLike joining a club, getting involved in research, etc. \n\n\nI just don\u2019t think ASU has some world renowned education that I want to take as many classes, I\u2019m here for the degree and to get out.",

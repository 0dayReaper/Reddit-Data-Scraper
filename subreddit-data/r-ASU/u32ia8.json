Thousands of students were highly recommended to go home if they could and when it came time to renew dorms or asu-affiliated apartments, the school decided it\u2019s best chance was for convert like 3 out of the 5 upperclassmen dorms for only freshmen, leaving for thousands to fight for an on campus housing spot. And for those who couldn\u2019t secure a place at ASU only had the choice to sign an expensive lease. All of this is happening and ASU decided to go ahead with building this thing that has old people paying over $4k in rent a month.",

The Land is just leased from ASU, and the big corporation gets the university's tax break.\n\nCrow will argue this brings more profit to the university to fund other needs. I call BS when a new dorm for students could have charged $9000 per bed and served the student body. Add to that the loss of revenue from the daily parking fees at that Huge ASU parking lot that used to be there. So I'm not buying that it's financially more beneficial. \n\nI think ASU is just slowly trying to phase out anything but Freshmen housing. It's easier for him to relegate that to private companies and not have to enforce ASU rules or hire staff. If that means students have to pay inflated rents on 12 month leases, and lose $3000 of Financial Aid allowance, what does he care? Next year, Tooker, Irish, and Hayden are all going Freshman Only as well. The amount of Freshmen admitted this year is 10,000 more than a few years ago. That is only going to drive the rents on those off campus units even higher in coming years.",

I promise its not worth your time or energy to try and respond in contexts like these. I understand why, but I also understand we'll be old eventually too and be in the same place as y'all. It's just incredibly infuriating to see all this play out, knowing full well that ASU is only on the side that's going to make them a profit. Cronkite is an incredible school, I'm a bit biased, but I bet he'll do great wherever. he goes. ASU is a business like every other educational institution, but it does do amazing things for their students. Everyone gets a chance to access amazing opportunities. Go Devils! Lol",

My first move if it was my business would be to call every law firm in town asking if they want to do some Pro Bono work on a high profile press case and precedent setting. Surprised some ASU Alum haven't come forward already.\n\nI honestly would not be at all surprised to find out the complaints are coming from staff and not residents. This isn't a retirement community, it's an assisted living nursing home. So if the residents are awake at night, that's more work for the staff. \n\nAlso curious if their motives have anything to do with the convention center going up there now. Force all events to occur there instead. Will they be insisting the Center hold no concerts or events after 10pm? There's an argument for you. If they say this for your venue, it better apply to the Center events as well.\n\nThis place had Zero reason to be built in that location. Crow should be ashamed of himself! And what would they do with the land if bought... build things for old people instead of students? AZ is full of retirement communities. It's disgusting that Crow leased off ASU land for this, especially when ASU desperately needs more dorms for students!",

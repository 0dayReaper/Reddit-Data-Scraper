Once again congratulations!!",

I'm not super up to date on those rules now, as I'm not longer a partner. \n\nIt took me two years. I started March 2019 finished March 2021(technically May because that's when the session ended but I finished my class mid session and didnt need to take classes for the second session). And I also only needed two more years for undergrad. I did my associates at my local community college before transferring to ASU. About 20 of my credits didn't transfer, so I would check with an advisor to see how credits will transfer over if your girlfriend is doing the same.",

Just class and studying/memorization.",

If the OP is taking only BIO 201 though I think he should be fine and shouldn\u2019t have to dedicate his life to studying. If he\u2019s taking other classes or working a full time job along with that in the summer I would agree with you that he should reconsider doing BIO 201 over summer",

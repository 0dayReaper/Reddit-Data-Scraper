I got offered an unsubsidized loan and I have a few questions about it. \n\n1) If I accept it does it pay for my schooling and then they send me the rest in a check, or it all comes to me at once? \n2) Can I choose how much of the loan I want to accept, if so how? \n3) Do I have to make payments every month on this loan or can I wait like a year and then start paying? \n4) Will this affect my credit in anyway?",

If you choose unsubsidized loans they will accrue interest even while you are in school.  Subsidized loans means the gov pays the interest while you are attending school but they will accrue interest when you are out of school.  If you can choose, take a subsidized option.\n\n&gt;4) Will this affect my credit in any way?\n\nYes, it shows on your credit report as any other loan and can affect your credit both positively or negatively, depending on what you do.

They should reach out on your behalf to your graduate advisor and program faculty to verify that you\u2019ve met the requirements and be able to post the degree. If you\u2019ve completed everything, then it\u2019s likely something just didn\u2019t get posted on your iPOS. \n\nIf there *is* something missing, then the advisor and program faculty would need to work with you to ensure you complete any unmet requirements.",

            "comment": "The thing with Agave is that you get just the bare minimum commodities, but the price you pay for it isn't justified. It's not unlivable by any stretch, there is a Safeway and other decent restaurants like Panda Express, Little Caesar's, and a Subway nearby. There's also an Eco Laundry very close to the place which you can use when the laundry machines don't work (which has happened many times for me personally). \n\nThe good thing is, there is a shortcut route that you can walk on to get to the ASU campus in 10-15 minutes, so it's relatively close to the campus. The Mars orbit bus also operates frequently, so there's also that mode of conveyance in peak summer or winter times. \n\nOverall, it's not too bad to live in, but there are certainly better options out there, price-wise and even in terms of the amenities offered, so do research on them before finalizing. Hope this helps!",

The only time I had a bug in my room was spider. My whole floor was genuinely clean most of the time but I think that\u2019s only because there was always campus tours coming through each week.",

I\u2019m thinking of withdrawing so I don\u2019t get an F, the withdrawal date is June 5, a couple days from now. I\u2019m thinking of doing MAT210 on Universal Learner; do I get the same credit once I pass the class on Universal Learner as I would if I passed MAT210 summer class?",

            "comment": "Yes, you can take MAT210 on Universal Learner, and it counts exactly the same as a campus class. MAT210 is offered as a self-paced class. That means you can start it at anytime and finish it at your own pace, whether that be 3-weeks or 1-year. Be aware though that if you do not finish by August, your Fall classes may be affected if any require 210 as a pre-requisite.",

There has been Absolutely Nothing said by ASU that this will be changing again. In fact, the last word issued by Universal Learner was in the opposite direction, saying they will allow Grade Replacement from their courses.",

My parents are saying that they just can't afford the fees. My father can only afford $15k-$20k per annum. Is there any possible way for me to get additional scholarship or anything that can help me in any way? Please help me out, I'm desperate.",

Particularly Mesa CC, Glendale CC, South Mountain CC, and Phoenix College are among the ones with the best programs but all colleges are good. \n\nHere is the international student enrollment info:\nhttps://www.maricopa.edu/become-student/international-admissions\n\nYou can split your courses between ASU and CC but typically the first 2 years can be done completely at the community colleges then you can transfer to ASU.",

Total 4 year cost might be about right. Get a student apartment near asu campus and connect into the social life for your first year.\n\nhttps://admission.asu.edu/apply/transfer/MyPath2ASU",

            "comment": "Scholarships in general are very competitive and most of the time allocated to doctoral/research candidates. You might qualify for one in semester 2 or year 2 but getting admission along with scholarships is rare unless you have an outstanding profile/qualifications.\n\nCan you mention what program and major? Typically you need to show proof of funds for 1st year. It could be from your family\u2019s savings or a student loan. Depending on what major you are, there could be internships you would be eligible under CPT and employers pay stipend. Again depending on what industry your employer is in, your internship might help cover your expenses and tuition from year 2. With current economic climate, things are a bit uncertain but definitely not impossible. \n\nAnother principle that helps is live below your means during school and even until you payoff student loans. Of course there\u2019s no bargain on tuition numbers but living expenses are something you can control.",

You  could complete many of your general requirements/intro classes through ASU's Universal Learner program &amp; CLEP. With these programs you can complete 1 to 2 years of courses depending on your expected major for very little. The UL courses are only $425 each even cheaper than community college if you're out of state and are treated no differently than regular ASU courses in terms of a transcript. The CLEP exams are free if you go through [Modernstates.com](https://Modernstates.com).",

Or is situation still bad? \n\nIt would be really helpful if you could provide some insights or any comment related to it. Any experiences or how your international peers are doing in this market?",

Keeping in mind the current layoffs and hiring freeze it is still bad. But I have another offer now. Ig it depends on which industry you are targeting. A lot of companies are not ready to have you if you need sponsorship in the future but you still have a chance. I know a lot of people who still have an active offer for this summer. ASU doesn't help at all. I mean you can find a student worker position on campus, but that is kinda tough too as a lot of international students are coming nowadays. If you narrow your search properly and trim your resume accordingly then you can. But I think for you when you join, I bet you will be looking for internships in the Summer of 2024 and by that time I hope that situation stabilizes a lil bit.",

Some people have it some don't. In this market, there is no guarantee that you will stick for a longer time. Some of my friends got laid off after working for 3-4 months. ASU does help you trim the resume (Career Services), mock interview prep, and all that.",

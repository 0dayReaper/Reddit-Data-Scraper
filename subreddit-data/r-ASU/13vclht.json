I know there are plenty of options to choose from, but we don't want to be stuck in a shitty place for a year. If you have any horror stories of apartment complexes, please post them here so we can avoid them!!!!",

Of course, if your infestation has been going on for months and you have many, then it might be worth breaking the lease to have a better state of mind. I've dealt with the triple threat of bed bugs, roaches and mice once, but couldn't break a lease as I was poor so don't stress yourself if it's affecting your mental health. Unless you will starve, leave your place if the bugs are messing with you too much",

I have moved around quitw a bit between apartments in tempe so i can give you some of my recommendations based on my and my friend's experiences. \n\n\nPlaces to avoid: \n\n1) West 6 - huge party place and super noisy. And the management there sucks.\n2) Apollo - pretty much like W6 but worse and everything is breaking.\n3) Oliv- my friends had bad experience there. \n4) Rise (from my friends experience it is too loud)\n5) University House\n\nPlaces I recommend:\n1) Redpoint (downside they dont have 1x1 apartments)\n\n2) Park Place (great place. Can get noisy depending on your neighbours or if your apartment faces the pool area). I had a great experience living there. I had a great time there. \n\n3) Local Apartments or the Emmerson. Great places but kinda pricey.\n\n4) Union -Tempe: There are 1x1 apartments in the North side of the buildings. I would recommend living in those. Avoid the south side. Downside is that pool and amenities there aren't always open. If someone breaks a glass, they'll shutdown the pool for a few weeks.",

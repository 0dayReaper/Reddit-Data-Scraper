Then if you have leftover financial aid (like you took out $10k in loans but tuition school billed you was $8k, you would then get $2k for yourself) it gets put into your bank account either through direct deposit or a check. If scholarships are coming from an outside source aka not the school itself, typically those who give out the scholarships will request your school\u2019s information to make sure it\u2019s get set up with financial aid, they usually do not give you it in the form of check/cash that you can hypothetically keep for yourself.",

Let\u2019s say you did not want the $2k, you have like 30 days to return that money and to return the full $2k amount and you will only be responsible for the $8k you took out. But if you did want the full $10k, depending on what type of loan it is (either it accumulates interest or if doesn\u2019t during school), you will not be forced to pay any payment until 6 months after you graduate college, and even then if you go from undergrad to postgrad like medical or law school, they\u2019ll hold off on requesting payments until you are like 100% done with school.",

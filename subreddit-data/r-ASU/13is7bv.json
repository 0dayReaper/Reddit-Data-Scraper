            "comment": "I\u2019ve taken them all and the first thing that you need to come to terms with is that they are all 400 level Econ classes\u2026\n\nThere isn\u2019t an easy 400 level Econ course. That said\u2026 what you are interested in is going to effect your value in the class. \n\nI think the most broadly useful class is 421. And if you have the ability to take the class from Wong I 100% encourage you to do so. His happy place is getting students to learn economics. He will take whatever time it takes to get there with you. He\u2019s great. The tricky part of 421 is changing your headspace to think of everything from the perspective of a company as opposed to the traditional view that you are working with in early classes where you see it from the consumer\u2019s perspective. \n\nNext ECN 438: it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s a lot of money talk and if you are going into something that you need to think in trading forex or working with changing currency like trading in foreign goods or services or whatever this could be for you. It\u2019s an ok class, just muuuhh. \n\nECN 441: this is all about government spending. It\u2019s probably not a bad class if you have the right teacher. I would recommend not taking it with Ramirez De La Vina. There is too much accent distraction with her. \n\nThis class isn\u2019t as hard, but the delivery is horrible. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was her voice or if it was just not a well put together class. Unless you like government spending and see yourself in a government think tank or wanting to be a policy wonk, I\u2019d say the more lucrative options are the first two. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I got A+ in all three, but if I were to need only one class and I didn\u2019t see myself in government or international trade, I\u2019d probably just do 421. \n\nAnd to be honest, if I were going into government, and I had to do 441 and only De La Vina was teaching it, I\u2019d look elsewhere for the class. \n\nMaybe someone else would be more helpful.",

            "comment": "I took Labor and Public and neither one is terribly difficult, relative to the intermediate micro/macro classes. I thought Labor was harder. I took it with Wong and he is great, but the textbook wasn\u2019t imo, even though it is probably the smallest and shortest econ textbook; it read really confusing to me. Public on the other hand had the best textbook (Gruber) of all the Ecn classes I took and the material and tests were easier than Labor. But with that said, Labor was probably one of, if not the most interesting classes despite its difficulty. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the easiest path, it\u2019s probably 441 and 438. If you\u2019re looking for the most interesting path, I\u2019d for sure add 421.",

            "comment": "long answer tbh. So the program is meant for you to get yourself out there, in cross sectors such as public, private nonprofit, etc. The pros are lots of employers come by and tell you what they have available, and you can make a network with whatever you are interested in. Help the community depending on your mission team, 2k-3k scholarship money(depending on how much you need), and do some cool events.                    \nThe cons IMO is that it can be overwhelming if not planning everything right. You do have to do 3 internships in all sectors mentioned earlier in your 4 years of doing the program and if you are a transfer student you only have 2 years to get that done,  you have to keep a certain GPA, do 3 events within your mission team, and 4 events with the engagement circle each semester. Complete one leadership role in the program, and do the mandatory events, unless you fill out a form to give your reason why you cannot go.  Also, you take classes in the program and so far for me all of them haven't been too difficult and overall are fun.    \n The program itself is extremely fun when you manage everything right, but if you keep in contact with the staff, and fellow ngsc students it can be a breeze and you can potentially find something that works for you. I'm aware that if it sounds like a lot for you then maybe it isn't for you especially depending on your major and overall life but if not come along and join, I've been enjoying the program in my experience so far, and if you have any questions dm me or any of the staff in the program for further questions.",

    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI just finished my first year at ASU last month and I signed up for summer classes to get ahead. What\u2019s weird is these classes are 1k more than my normal classes during the year. They\u2019re the same amount of credits, so does anyone know why they\u2019re so much more expensive? \n\nThanks in advance!",

ASU Online is completely by credit with no cap. \n\nTuition and Fee Schedule: https://catalog.asu.edu/tuitionandfees/fees_fall2023",

So if you are a resident Online student, the cap is at 10 credits, so any further credits after 10 does not incur additional tuition. If you are a non-resident Online student, there is no cap, you pay for every credit. These are both for Fall and Spring terms. \n\nFor Summer as an Online student, resident and non-resident students are on the same tuition/fee schedule and there is no cap. \n\nSo it just comes down to what type of student you are (residency and college) as well as the number of credits and the term in which you are taking them.",

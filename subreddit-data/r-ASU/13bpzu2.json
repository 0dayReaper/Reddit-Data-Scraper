Many people still skip it since you don't walk across the stage but the crowds are still pretty large . WP Carey is still one of the larger ceremonies based on the number of graduates. Basically getting a \"headliner\" schedule of 7pm at Sun Devil Stadium you're among the largest ceremonies. WP Carey even split their ceremonies into undergrad and graduate convocations. Expect parking and leaving the garage to be a huge hassle so arrive early and be prepared to leave much later if you stay until the fireworks and confetti are launched at the conclusion of the commencement and convocation.",

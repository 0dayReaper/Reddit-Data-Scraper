I also have some more specific questions:\n\nSo CSE 485 is taken first during one semester and then CSE 486 is taken the next semester?  Do you have to have the same team all throughout or will you have one team one semester and then another team the next semester?\n\nCould I take one capstone during the summer and the other one during a regular semester, or does it not work out like that?\n\nFrom your experience, did most students already have a team in mind?  I don\u2019t know anyone at ASU (non-traditional student) so what happens if we don\u2019t have a team to choose, do we sign up for a random team?\n\nI\u2019d also appreciate if someone could break down what the workload is like.  Is it a lot of coding or a lot of writing and presentations, or all of the above?\n\nThanks",

Do you have to have the same team all throughout or will you have one team one semester and then another team the next semester?\n\nbasically capstone is a year long project. most of the time you'll be in the same team working on the same project both semesters unless something happens in your team that forced you to move to a different project. \n\n\\&gt; Could I take one capstone during the summer and the other one during a regular semester, or does it not work out like that?\n\nyou can but idk how capstone is structured in the summer.\n\n\\&gt; From your experience, did most students already have a team in mind? I don\u2019t know anyone at ASU (non-traditional student) so what happens if we don\u2019t have a team to choose, do we sign up for a random team?\n\nyou could make a team, but it's on you to find a mentor, people, and a project before capstone starts. if you dont want to do that then you'll be given a random team and a random project from the \\~10 you've picked out from a list of 100+ projects. \n\n\\&gt; I\u2019d also appreciate if someone could break down what the workload is like. \n\nworkload is dependent on the project and team you have. you can either be in a team where you have to do all the work or get carried. \n\n\\&gt; Is it a lot of coding or a lot of writing and presentations, or all of the above?\n\nthe coding depends on what project you are assigned. some projects range from cybersec to game design to hardware. there is going to be a bit of writing. every two weeks, you and your team will write a sprint report that goes over who was assigned to work on what task during those two weeks and things like that. there's only 2 presentations in the entire capstone that you'll need to do which are pretty easy.",

            "comment": "You can take 485 over the summer but not 486. The overall class is mostly structured towards your Capstone project with very small assignments such as small quizzes with endless attempts or writing about attending a small teaching. Attendance for the weekly lecture was very optional and was not too applicable, so most people I know just didn't attend those lectures.\n\nThe difficulty of this class is highly dependent on what you choose as your Capstone project, and I do not mean the topic of your project, but the person sponsoring it and their expectations. You will get to choose your project in like the first month when they send everyone a catalogue of available projects. You will fill out a form with your top 10 choices and be put in a group of around 4 people for the entire 485/486 classes. Some of these projects are sponsored by a company, so they could offer an internship near the end of these classes.\n\nPersonally, my Capstone experience seemed harder than most because my Sponsor seemed to have higher expectations than other Sponsors and had us do weekly updates and constant changes to our project even during breaks. I guess the only advice to have a smoother experience is to check Rate my professor if that Sponsor is a professor.\n\nTLDR: Mostly just a year long project. Hope you get good teammates like mine and hope you have a better Sponsor.",

            "comment": "Two consecutive semesters, same team. You can start any semester you want, I did summer then fall. You can have a topic in mind and suggest it, but they will give you a big list of topics if you don't have one in mind, and they will try to match you to a topic you ranked highly.\n\nWorkload depends on the project and role you take on in the team. I personally didn't code much and did a lot of the writing, presenting, and communicating cause I am better at that. Across the entire team it's quite a mix of all types of work.\n\nYou probably won't be surprised much with your teammates either. I picked an 'easy' seeming project and mostly got very laid back teammates. If you pick an Intel project or something you might end up with a team that is very ambitious and works a lot on it.",

When I did my capstone I handled more of the data structures, so while I had a busier first month or so of the capstone, it got really chill afterwards. You stay on the same team, but be aware you have to sign up for the same 486 session as your 485 team. Depending on your project it can be really chill or intense, with little to no middle ground. All in all, senior year was the easiest year for me in terms of workload and course difficulty",

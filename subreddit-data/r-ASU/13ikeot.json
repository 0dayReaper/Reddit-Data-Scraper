    "postText": "Hello! I'm someone who has been doing online schooling at ASU. I graduate at the end of summer so unfortunately I won't be able to fly down to Arizona until the winter in December. Because of this I wanted to see if I could just buy the gown (I'm getting the cap already in the mail through starbucks' achievement plan package) so I can go take photos when I visit my cousins in October.\n\nIs there anywhere I can buy just the gown? Do they sell them on a certain website or do I buy them at the stores on campus?",

            "comment": "Okay ASU's CS program isn't really hard to get into. SAT scores don't matter much and it's easy to choose almost anything you like! But I'd say the CS program is hard once you get into it lol! Just be ready to face some draining courses and assignments. And when it comes to internships, I met a lot of people from CS and EEEs who are interns right now! It's kinda hard to get an internship in your freshman year and even during the third semester (never impossible though, depends on your dedication), but people ideally start looking for internships in their sophomore year! There are a lot of good internship opportunities with companies like Intel, Deloitte, Cisco, etc etc and even have the chance to work remotely for Microsoft, Tesla, etc in California (since that's our neighbor). There are aboard internship opportunities by ASU too, though that costs a lil too much imo. But yeah! You're gonna be in the right place :) good luck!",

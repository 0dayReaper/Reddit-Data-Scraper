There are triggers in the system to remove aid when students are not enrolled in enough credits and then the mechanism that verifies enrollment minimums have been reached again take at least overnight to process. \n\nAlso, the aid system likes to generally get wonky during Summer and then straightens out in August. You can definitely reach out to Financial Aid to ask what\u2019s going on, but I wouldn\u2019t be too worried this far out from the Fall term.",

Don't worry! You might just have to call them and have them manually check and then fix it on their end.",

You can always wait until they release the syllabuses if professors have specific requirements because I\u2019m not sure if every lab professor is the same (they seem to be but I\u2019m not sure but they don\u2019t seem to be picky about brands or anything) Amazon sells normal lab coats and goggles.\n\nEdit: I generally prefer safety glasses because they give you less of a headache and don\u2019t leave marks on your face lol!",

It depends on the TA.\n\nOverall, unless your TA requires it, you might not need to bring one. If someone subs in, it won\u2019t hurt because you can just complete the work outside of class.",

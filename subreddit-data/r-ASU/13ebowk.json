I didn\u2019t go to class I just watched the recorded lectures and studied hard for it and took good notes. Tests were super fair so as long as u knew it u were fine. I took my final in Michigan at a 4th of July party when I was wasted off my ass. Finished the class w a B.",

He literally lets the class talk over him in a lack of self respect kinda way. I remember a student had to yell \u201cwill all of you in the back please shut the fuck up and stop talking\u201d and he had to add \u201cyes, please stop\u201d in a tone that made it seem like he couldn\u2019t do it himself \n\nIf you can learn on your own you\u2019ll be okay but don\u2019t expect him to be an outstanding professor.",

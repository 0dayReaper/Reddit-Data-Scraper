Way easier to make friends because you\u2019re on campus all the time, way easier to make time to meet with professors whenever, independence from home and it\u2019s a great experience. After first year or two you can commute to save money because being on campus is less exciting and you\u2019ll probably want your own space again. That\u2019s how it was for me. I also live close to campus but lived in a dorm and it was only fun first year because manzanita was pretty nice at the time, don\u2019t know if it still is",

It is so much easier to make friends when you live on campus and the proximity to everything is very nice. Those freshman year friendships you made with people in your dorm are something special you\u2019ll always remember. And if you don\u2019t like it you can commute your sophomore year and beyond. Most people live off campus after their freshman year anyways\n\nLet me put it this way: you only really have one (maybe 2) chances to live on campus. Better to have that experience and may or may not like it than to not have it and wonder what you missed out on.",

The fact that you live really close to campus makes this even more of a no brainer to me because if you are feeling homesick you can visit home SO easily. \n\nIf you end up not being able to tolerate living in the dorms, at least you tried it and you can move home easily after the first semester. But you\u2019ll never know what you\u2019re missing out on if you don\u2019t try it!!

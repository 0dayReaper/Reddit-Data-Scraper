    "postText": "A task appeared on my financing task list telling me to submit my HS transcript. I already submitted my college transcript (I'm transferring to ASU) and thought you weren't required to turn in an HS transcript. I graduated from HS a few years back and my grades and GPA were awful. However my college transcript it great A's and a few B's.  I don't think my HS transcript will affect anything considering I think they'll only take into account my college one right???",

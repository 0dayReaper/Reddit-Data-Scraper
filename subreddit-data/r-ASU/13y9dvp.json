    "postText": "(Tempe preferred)\n\nHi! Recently one of my roommates suddenly moved away, and he left his cat at our apartment. He has said explicitly that he does not want her anymore, and thought it was a genius idea to leave the idea of what to do with her to me. Our lease ends in about 1 1/2 months, and i\u2019m going to be moving in with my other roommate to another house, and we do not have the proper accommodations to house a cat. \n\nWith that said, her name is Autumn. I\u2019ve already tried all nearby shelters, but they\u2019ve all been full. Please let me know if anyone has questions or concerns! I would be happy to answer them!\n\nAutumn is 3 years old, gotten from the Humane Society. She was born in a hoarder house with a bunch of other cats, and was neglected before she was rescued. She\u2019s very shy at first, but is an amazing, cuddly girl once she warms up to you. She loves face rubs and loves to just relax on her favorite bed.",

There is no way to properly screen people adopting and its not always a guarantee people rehoming through those sites have good intentions. If it comes to it, there are sites like pet finder and one that the humane society has on their website where you can post adoption ads. Wishing you the best.",

As long as the pet is cared for, doesn't go hungry, gets medical attention when it's needed. If the pet is cared for, there's no problem. But like I said, if you can't afford a rehoming fee, can you afford a vet visit? If you can't take care of your pet, and you give it a fucked up life of pain because you're entitled, then FUCK YOU. \n\nAnd if you're so imbalanced that you would kill yourself without a pet, then it's probably an abusive home for the pet. And you probably also need to be cared for in a facility.\n\nAnd yes, better a pet be euthanized than live in years of agony because of a tumor that nobody can afford to have removed.",

It looks like you owe 9k for summer tuition, but they currently estimate it will all be eventually covered by future financial aid, so you don't actually owe anything at this moment.  If that future financial aid is from starbucks, then i would definitely not quit my job at starbucks yet without first getting assurances from them (in writing? that's a lot of money.) that they will still pay your summer tuition after you quit.",

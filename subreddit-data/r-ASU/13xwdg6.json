    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm an incoming exchange students and planning to take:\n1. DAT402 machine learning for data science\n2. CIS325 fundamental techniques for business data analytics\n3. CIS412 business data mining\n4. CIS415 big data analytics in business \n\nTo those who took any of those modules recently, could you please share your experiences taking them? and could anyone advise whether taking these 4 mods together is too much? Thank you!",

            "comment": "It really depends on what you're trying to do and what your background is.\n\nIf you want to be a true, or in nicer terms, a better data scientist, then you're going to need to study more mathematics and statistics e.g., probability, linear algebra, design of experiments (ANOVA, ANCOVA, Mixed Models, etc), multivariate statistics (MANOVA, LDA, etc). These will give you the stronger foundation to better understand how machine learning models behave (optimization &amp; predictive power), as opposed to jsut glancing over it. If you already have the mathematics/statistics background, then by all means take these classes. \n\nThis is just my opinion though. Others are welcomed to chime in.",

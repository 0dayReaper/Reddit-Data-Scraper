    "postText": "Hello all,\nI have only taken a handful of classes at ASU. All of the classes I have taken thus far have provided some form of video lectures. I am currently enrolled in CSE 205 this summer and I am a little baffled to find there are no lecture videos, just lecture slides and some interactive book called zybooks. Is this common for ASU online and specifically in the CS department?\nSome of us are auditory learners. Seems like a cheap way to reduce the need for professors to actually teach us. \n\nWhat the hell are we paying for then if we have to go on YouTube or use other online resources to teach ourselves??",

University has been harder so far but not due to the course material; it's a mixed bag on professors and if they're actually going to be good and care about the stuff they're teaching. I find myself having to do what you're doing where I have to teach myself a lot of stuff. The quality of education I was getting at CC was definitely better than it has been at university (for the classes I've taken so far, at least), which is pretty disappointing, especially considering CC was only $85 per credit hour lol.\n\nI'm hoping this changes as I get into some of the upper division classes. I'm not trying to complain but just saying it's been kind of a rude awakening as I expected more and have found myself in the same boat as OP.",

In my experience they'll go over high level topics and some of the theory of what's going on, but when the rubber meets the road for actually coding an assignment, Google is your best friend.\n\nSome courses are better than others, especially ones with specific domain knowledge like embedded programming or assembly.  Sometimes they'll provide code snippets or examples that help nail down the context and syntax of how something is supposed to work.  Ultimately almost all programming is up to your own research.\n\nHonestly for some (most?) classes I don't watch the lectures anyway. I'll skim the slides for whatever I need to reference.  This doesn't always work (you need them in calculus and physics and chemistry) but for programming concepts I can usually put it together without watching someone talk for 40 minutes.",

Most of the video lectures were too confusing or just useless. Some of the example videos ASU provides is just someone reading the text on the slide with 0 explanation. It's sad that these classes cost thousands of dollars...   \nAs for CSE205, There are some videos in the zybook, but i never played a single one. If i needed clarification on something, a youtube searched sufficed.  \nCSE110 and CSE205 are pretty much \"here's the zybook, do it\" classes lol.",

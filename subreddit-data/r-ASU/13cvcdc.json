    "postText": "I\u2019m feeling a little depressed about my 3.1 GPA. I really don\u2019t want to blame my past hospitalization but I feel like ever since that moment, my motivation and functionality really dwindled down. Before that, my GPA was at a 3.8 (which is crazy good!) \nNow I\u2019m graduating tomorrow with a 3.1 and I just don\u2019t know what the outcome of my future will look like. Maybe someone, who graduated with a 3.1 GPA, can give me some insight and tell me it\u2019s not the end of the road for me. I appreciate it.",

But the lingering fatigue and daily headaches is what led me to struggling. It\u2019s still lingering but not as bad. It really set me back because I had to medically withdrawal. 2021-2022 was not a good year because of the \u201clong covid\u201d. Like I said, I really hate to blame it but it was just so hard to control and there was no medicine or therapy at the time to help it. I was taking advil almost daily which is not ok. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",

By the time I graduated I got a 2.8. \n\nI'm now on track to be the youngest supervisor in an oncology lab. In my experience, GPA doesn't really matter too much. It's the connections and the actual degree that matter. \n\nBe easy on yourself. You did the damn thing and you should be beyond proud.",

You\u2019re young and just achieved a huge milestone in your life so congrats on that and don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. As it relates to future employment please trust that your GPA is almost irrelevant. What matters most is past work/internship experience and personal/academic projects that relate to whatever job/industry you\u2019re trying to get into. Connections help a ton too, so hold onto any contacts you made in school because it can help in the future more than you might think. You may not have performed to the standards you held for yourself, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not good enough and can\u2019t do better. Keep your head up, I\u2019ve been where you are and have managed to find success despite multiple challenges and am always looking for ways to grow. I don\u2019t know you, but I believe in you!",

    "postText": "Hey, incoming freshman here. I've been looking at some courses I wanted to enroll in my first semester, and found that a lot of them have requirements for other introductory courses. \n\nEg: I was looking at SES 230 (Coding for Exploration) and it requires the intro math course (MAT 270). I won't have any problem with the actual course material, so is there any way I could actually enroll in the class?",

Follow the instructions given by the department on how to request the override.\n3. If the department approves the override they can either enter the override online, or fill out the bottom\nportion of this form and stamp it with their department approval stamp.\n4. If the department enters the override approval online, you can register online via My ASU or in person\nwith an Enrollment Request form at any University Registrar Services location.\n5. If the department does not enter the override approval online, you will need to submit this form along\nwith an Enrollment Request Form to any University Registrar Services location (see http://students.asu.edu/contact/office-university-registrar for location information).\n\n\nhttps://students.asu.edu/forms/override-authorization",

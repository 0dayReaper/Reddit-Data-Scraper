            "comment": "Any Intel based laptop post 8th gen and i5 will suffice. AMD should preferably be Ryzen 5000 series but 3000-4000 should be usable as long as they're 5 series for those gens. Avoid Macs as most M1 machines will not work with your major well. Even Intel will be middling due to thermals. You can go as affordable as a Thinkpad T480 or as balls to the wall as an Alienware 17 inch with an i9 and 4090 mobile. I like Acer Swift X series, Thinkpad T series, Dell Latitude/XPS(if you got the cash) and especially Framework. There's a few others but your budget will dictate what you can choose",

            "comment": "Plenty of good advice here, but if you can, I'd try getting your laptop at somewhere like Costco or Sam's Club (with Costco selling the higher end stuff). These places extend the warranty on all electronics for an extra year so even if you don't have a membership it is worth the $50 to get a membership just for the warranty benefit.\n\nCostco has some good options that are in the $800-$1100 range and online you can get $2,000+ options.\n\nEDIT: Also, if something should goes wrong in the first \\~100 days (90 days is the official policy) Costco has a generous return policy without having to go through an RMA process that usually takes 2-3 weeks.",

I have had Dell Latitudes (and supported them forever, they are not gaming machines, but will do your class work perfectly).\n\nIf you are the least but mechanically inclined, upgrading the storage (call it hard drive/SSD etc) and RAM is pretty easy.\n\nA 1TB SSD is ideal, Matlab and other software packages are huge.  2TB isn't a bad idea if it won't break the bank.\n\n16GB RAM should be the minimum memory.\n\nTowards the end of your second year, plan on buying a nicer new system to complete your last two years.",

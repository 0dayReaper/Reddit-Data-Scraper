    "postText": "My mom passed away in high school and I\u2019ve been supporting myself since then. I never had any problems with FAFSA before because the social worker from my high school wrote a letter as proof and gave it to the community college I attended. I\u2019ve never been asked to verify my status till now. I submitted my mom\u2019s death certificate a couple times but they keep rejecting it. It says to look for their email as it explains why but never got anything aside from saying they are unable to process it. Will I still be able to get loans or grants for the upcoming school year?",

Fill out the [dependency review form](https://webforms.asu.edu/eform/submit/dependency-review-2024) and include the death certificate and incarceration documentation, I just contacted the public records department and they were able to give it to me. or if your dad isn\u2019t incarcerated, I believe there are other options as well but I am less familiar with those",

Sadly, so I put how my dad never raised me. I never lived with him I don\u2019t know where he is and I don\u2019t have contact with him I showed my moms death certificate. If you are a ward of the state when you were a kid it\u2019s more helpful. You said you had a social worker maybe try to get into about the ward of the state? If no one adopted you sometimes that\u2019s the status that helps me. Tbh I don\u2019t remember how I got that it was so long ago but I wrote a long detailed thing and they stfu at the financial aid office. It\u2019s so stupid how hard they make it just because you\u2019re not 26. Don\u2019t give up you can do this. You\u2019re going to be so successful and this small obstacle isn\u2019t going to stop you from being everything you imagine. You\u2019re obviously resilient and you\u2019re going to get what you want okay.",

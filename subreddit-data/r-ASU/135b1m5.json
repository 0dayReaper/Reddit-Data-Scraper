    "postText": "ASU Alum here! Now that I've graduated and been working for a bit I've been missing the Horticulture lab out at Poly. I was wondering if there was any way to get involved/help out by either supplying plants or volunteering time. I figure a bunch of the work is done by students for studying or by professors, but I also think there's probably some processes that they'd rather outsource, so I'd like to see if/what there is available! Anyone have any info on this?",

    "postText": "Has anyone taken IDS 401? Particularly online? I have to take it but being an online student, I am not sure what it really entails. The School website describes a few different kind of IDS 401 courses a student can take, but the descriptions are very formal.\nI want to hear from your student experiences taking which course, in person or online, because there isn\u2019t much student experiences out there. Any professors you recommend? Any professors you think I should stay away from? Please let me know!",

Directed study is great if you have grad school aspirations, otherwise a virtual experience is a great resume builder. GEO offers global virtual internships which can count for IDS 401 as well. \n\nAlso there is recorded showcase sessions of students in each option should you want them you just need to ask the office.",

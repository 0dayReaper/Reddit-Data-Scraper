Instead of just asking for $8,400 they ask for $9,000 then your fees are $450, they credit you $8550 take out the $8,000 and send you a check for $550. You think it\u2019s free money and don\u2019t notice that they just increased your loan and skimmed you out of some more money because it is all just part of a student loan\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t just assume that you have free money. \n\nAccounting departments are not stupid. If you got money it came from somewhere. Asking questions is a good way to figure out where it came from. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a special grant that you qualify for, maybe it\u2019s a refund for classes you were over charged for and you should check out the other classes to see if you have been overcharged, maybe it\u2019s a student loan that you have to pay more for each dollar that they originate from the loan. \n\nFind out what it is.",

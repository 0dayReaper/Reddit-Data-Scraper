    "postText": "I am an upcoming freshman at ASU attending the WP Carey School of Business. I am thinking of majoring in digital marketing. I also might do a double major in another major at WPC like finance or accountancy. How easy is it to get a double major and what are the steps?",

            "comment": "Completing two business majors and graduating on time is very feasible. You\u2019d be adding 18-27 credits, depending on the major pairing you pursue. And that\u2019s fairly similar to having a minor or certificate. \n\nHowever, getting approved for concurrent business majors is hard for some students. You need to complete most of the business skills courses before you can petition for the second major. You also need to have a very good cumulative ASU GPA and skills course GPA. Those GPAs are the main factors for getting approved. There is a personal statement section that you definitely want to be mindful of. If you are on the boarderline with your GPAs, the departments will look at that statement. \n\nAlso, when it comes to which degree to do first and which one to add on later, if you know you want Accountancy or Finance, get your major declared as one of the first. ACC 232 and ACC 242 are the accountancy skills courses recommended for those majors, whereas others use ACC 231 and ACC 241, which are not as in-depth. The 232 and 242 will better prepare you for ACC 340, which is required in both Accountancy and Finance. Also, being in one of those majors and petitioning to add Marketing tends to be easier than being in Marketing and trying to add Accountancy or Finance. \n\nMost students won\u2019t be able to submit the concurrent degree petition until their sophomore year due to needing to complete the business skills courses. So, let yourself settle in during your first semester, talk to people, figure out what you are really interested in. And then in your second term (Spring 2024), make an appointment with your academic advisor to talk about the concurrent major and also get class recommendations for Fall 2024.",

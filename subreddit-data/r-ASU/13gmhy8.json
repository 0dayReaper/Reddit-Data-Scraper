I looked at her rate my professor reviews, and the most recent ones are AWFUL compared to the reviews that I saw when I signed up for the class. I\u2019m taking it as an icourse this summer because I heard that it was easier, but now i\u2019m low key regretting it because it just seems like a bad class and professor all around now.",

Good luck!",

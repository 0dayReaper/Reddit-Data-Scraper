Growing up in school they would have us do a cost breakdown of going to school out of state and in state, and even in state, 4 year tuition for ASU was so fucking high, and that was probably ten years ago D:\n\nI didn\u2019t grow up poor but definitely didn\u2019t grow up wealthy and always knew if I wanted to go to college, I had to get a scholarship or pay for it and that really turned me off of it at the time. \n\nNow that I have a more mature mindset and the actual WANT to go to school, it\u2019s been really really tough to find anything that works for me, between working ~50 hours a week &amp; finding time to go to the gym I have very little free time to put towards it, none on some days/week\n\nI\u2019m a frugal, picky son of a bitch\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 so I never wanted to do any of those weird online universities who I\u2019ve never heard of and I\u2019m not really able to be on a consistent schedule, like some days I can\u2019t be on zoom in class at 7:30pm. Then other days, I might be off work and get hyper-focused on busting out assignments and get days worth of work done at once.\n\nAll that being said, have you completed classes thru this before? If so, what was it like and how was your experience? I\u2019m gonna look around tonight and sign up for something I like within a few days",

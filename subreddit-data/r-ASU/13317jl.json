Tried opening it through a direct link outside the canvas app and it said I \"didn't have access to view this resource\". Tried to message the professor and the message is not going through as if I'm blocked. I'm wondering if its an end of the semester issue but none of my other classes / professors are gone",

I really doubt the final I turned in yesterday has even been looked at by this professor. I feel like it's unfair to not know where you stand in a class once everything is graded, before final grades actually get posted",

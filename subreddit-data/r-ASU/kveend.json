Which is probably a smarter way to do it, but I'm lucky I can get zoom to half do what I want, so personal room it is. Generally, if the room has it's own zoom it will be co-host but if I leave first then it takes over and if I want to have that leave the meeting then I have to make a student the host or just log back in.",

Then once class starts you can turn your cam on if required. If I'm in class extra early I mute my facecam as well. \n\nConversely. Use a funny background/dress in a costume or something and I will die laughing, which is great at breaking the tension.",

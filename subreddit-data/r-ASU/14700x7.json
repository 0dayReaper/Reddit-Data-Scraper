I have a Windows desktop, so I just used that, but there are also Windows computers available for use on campus (in Tempe at least).\n\nI'd say it's a great choice for a laptop. In my opinion, Windows laptops just cannot compete on hardware. The Macbook trackpad, keyboard, battery life, etc. just feels much better (in my experience, ymmv).",

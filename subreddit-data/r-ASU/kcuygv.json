The OP noted that faculty seem to wait until the last minute before the grading deadline to submit grades (see the meme posted by the OP). I\u2019ve been pointing out that one of the reasons this happens is that faculty sometimes give students until that point to submit work when situations warrant such an extension.\n\nSubmitting grades after the grading deadline is a major problem that can have negative effects on students\u2019 financial aid, scholarships, and more.",

This time around was tough because finals week was also the last week of instruction, so I didn't get my usual \"spare\" time to wrap classes up and have them waiting for the final to be submitted. This is the first semester I've still had a few outstanding grades in multiple classes by the final deadline.

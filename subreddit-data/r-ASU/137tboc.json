I\u2019m two away from 30 credit hours and the class I failed ain\u2019t even necessary for me\n\n\nTruly can\u2019t believe I let this happen to me",

So, consider the cost to take the summer course including books and then compare that to what a 20% loss of the scholarship would be for next year. And also consider if it would be easier to take the hit all at once for Summer or have it spread out among two terms next year. \n\nAlso, be aware that for federal aid in Summer, you need to be enrolled in 6 credits. Anything less is pretty much completely out of pocket. \n\nIf you have remaining scholarship terms, you could meet meet renewal requirements next year to get back to 100% for the year after (AY 24-25).",

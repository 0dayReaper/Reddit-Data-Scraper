You're basically just sitting in your school's section and listening to the speeches and awards given. The most you'll do is stand up and cheer when your school is called and at the end they shoot confetti and fireworks. You can definitely leave early if you wish, there's nothing really stopping you from doing so.\n\nYour school's convocation is where you will actually walk the stage as your name is called while you're shown on the big screen/zoom streams with your name and major displayed. Leaving early for these is frowned upon since it's considered disrespectful for those that are still waiting to walk the stage but, again, nothing is stopping you from leaving.",

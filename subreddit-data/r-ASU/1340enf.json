I am an ASU student majoring in Computer Science and I am in process to join the Army as a E4. \nFirst of all my recruiter wants me to bring the official transcript which for some reason I can\u2019t bring it to them because I own this school $7K. I need one and half years to graduate with my BS but since I have financial circumstances I won\u2019t be able to pay this amount in next 8 months. Do I have any legal way to obtain my paperwork at ROTC or veterans center at ASU or not? I know it might be silly questions but if someone can give an general advices. It will help me a lots.",

Go commission after grad if you want, or get a civie job that will pay a lot more than an O1. \n\nGoing enlisted *for the partial or exclusive purpose of solving financial insolvency* is the equivalent of being gut-shot, but deciding to walk to the hospital instead of calling 911 *partially or exclusively* to avoid the bill for the ambulance ride. You're still going to pay for the ride, and it's going to suck a whole lot more.",

Even if I will get my BS, I won\u2019t be able to became as a warrant officer because of the age restrictions. I am older then 29 and I am 32 now.

If you asked me why I want to join the Army, I can give you an honest answer without hesitation. At the age of 32, I am tired of being alone and not interacting with other people, including going to school and being around young people. Most people over 30 years old slow down and reach a point where they are bored with their lives. To tell you a little bit about myself, I grew up in Arizona and have been married for almost seven years. I was in a long-term relationship for another five years, but my ex cheated on me and got pregnant by an older man. I tried to make new friends or find girlfriends at ASU, but when you get older, it is hard to communicate with young people who are between 18 and 25 because I don't know what to talk to them about. That's why I am joining the military. At my age, I have reached a point where I must change something in my life and become a better version of myself. In the last two months, I have lost 15 pounds. My weight used to be 45 pounds, but now it is 30 pounds. I am not worried about my school debt because I am on a stable financial track, and I know how much I owe ASU. I will pay it off.",

The other points that\u2019s I didn\u2019t take the student loans because I don\u2019t want to be an debts. Actually my mom she has a student loan\u2019s around $100K and she is still paying off that amount. She studied as medical nursing in 2000th. Now she retired and my mom still pays for this student loans. \nI better work an two jobs and paying this amount off rather than to be an big debt later. As I know after when you will graduate you are going to have 8 months before you are going to start paying this loans. Plus the economy of this country is going down which affected on employments of other people. I have a friends of mine who worked in IT in NY, Chicago and Washington DC and they lost their jobs there. Now they moved to Arizona because this state has a better living.\n\nIt\u2019s really bagging me that people took it in on wrong way when you tried to ask advise about your situation. I red some of the the responses from others. You know I was on shock because some of them call me as a liar and others even cared about my question. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t post too much things here.",

You do not have to take the whole loan offered. What about taking 7k in loans to clear the debt then taking a small amount each semester to help with expenses. Take a lower credit load (like maybe 12 credits) and still work. It might take longer to graduate, but you are making progress and keeping the debt low. Having $20k in loans at the end is highly manageable and very different than $100k-especially if you pay more than the minimum each month.",

It seems like a bad economic time in this country or something else. The only company that worked with me was Capital One Bank since I am their client. I got pre-qualified for a $10K loan and put my car into the lian title. Currently, I am paying for my 2022 Toyota Corolla, which cost $28K, and I owe $23K with a monthly payment of $380. The company that financed my car, Bridgcrest, didn't want to sell my contract, and they said that if I refinance with them, my monthly payment would be around $700. However, Capital One declined my loan application. I have good credit scores and hold two credit cards with a total limit of $4500, but I don't use them. If you can recommend any companies that can provide private loans to pay for school, I would appreciate it. I don't mind graduating from ASU and getting a BS in IT, but I can't move forward until I pay off this debt.\n\n I don't blame anyone here and ask for advice, not opinions. That's why I decided to take a long break and join the US Army. My best friends were in the Army, and they got the GI Bill, which covers their education costs. Sometimes you have to take different routes to solve the problems you have. Also, my recruiter is dishonest with me, and I spoke with my friend, who is currently an E6 Petty Officer First Class, and he recommended that I change my recruiter and go to another place.",

I know that the used market was tight for a while, but I am faculty and don't drive a car that new. Go to Landings Credit Union and talk with them about options to refinance the car. Or, if you could sell  the car for what you owe, sell it, and buy a cheaper car. Because of the interest rate, loans are harder to get right now. \n\nYou may be an international student, but if you are not, is there a reason you aren't eligible for loans through ASU? I would definitely call financial aid again and let them know the issues and see what they can do. Sometimes if you get your bill below 5k they will let you register for another semester.",

Recruiters don't issue orders, so they can pretty definitively tell you what schools you'll be going to based on program, but that's like telling someone they'll be in Arizona if they're taking ASU classes in person. So I'll take 'stories that never happened for 1000 Alex' on the going to Ukraine 'options'.  \n\n\nAlso, last time I heard about it, isn't the iCAT the actual ASVAB, just on computer instead of pen and paper?

You will not be financially set unless ur getting BAH \u2014at duty stations like Hawaii or somewhere else with insane COL or a bonus which even then will not be as ideal as figuring out how to pay the 7K on your own and going to OCS (officer candidate school). Don\u2019t let any recruiter tell you enlisted is the better route, it\u2019s not. ONLY choose enlisted route if you\u2019re dead set on joining and can\u2019t get an OCS slot (the benefit is once you finish ur enlisted commitment you can re-up for OCS &amp; you\u2019ll qualify for the OE pay for O1-O3).\n\nI know the Army has intel (35 series jobs for enlisted peeps), but consider the AF. It\u2019s much more intel heavy and would a more beneficial branch to join given the degree you\u2019ll hold (also a lot more gentle on your body).",

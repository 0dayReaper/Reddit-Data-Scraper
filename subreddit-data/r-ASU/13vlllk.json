I read that ASU requires 30 unique credits to obtain a 2nd major so I just wanted to know if there's a way to decrease that number if majoring within the same college and similar majors.",

            "comment": "Many of the credits will count toward both, so the business skills courses, business core/ capstone, additional Gen Ed\u2019s, and career navigation classes only need to be taken once. \n\nBut W. P. Carey does not allow courses to count toward multiple majors. If you run a DARS for Finance, you\u2019ll see a section titled \u201cFINANCE Major\u201d. And if you run a DARS for Business Entrepreneurship, you\u2019ll see a section titled \u201cBUSINESS ENTREPRENEURSHIP Major\u201d. For W. P. Carey, it is those sections that cannot have courses counting toward both. So realistically you are only adding about 18 credits. \n\nNow, that is information for pursuing *concurrent* majors in WPC, meaning you will graduate with both degrees at the same time. You are going to need to talk to your academic advisor about planning this out. You also need to submit a petition to be considered for the concurrent major. I recommend being declared in Finance and then petitioning to add Business Entrepreneurship to have a better chance of approval. \n\nIf you graduate with one major and *then* come back for a second degree (called a post-baccalaureate), you would need to do at least 30 credit hours due to the university requirement on post-baccalaureate degrees. This option is also not great if you rely on federal aid, so consider that as well.",

I currently work in curriculum and can tell you this is not a university requirement. There is a basic requirement in order for a student to petition for a concurrent major they need to have at least 30 college credits complete - meaning most students can\u2019t be adding on a concurrent degree as a freshman. \n\nI also worked in advising for W. P. Carey for several years. The business college does not have a requirement about an additional 30 credits, only that credits within each major be unique. How many credits need to be unique depends on the pairing when you look at doing two business majors, but the bottom threshold is 18 credits. In pursuing Finance and Business Entrepreneurship, the difference is 18 credits.\n\nThe College of Liberal Art and Sciences does have a *college* requirement that at least 30 credits must be unique/exclusive to a major when concurrent degrees are pursued. However, the way CLAS structures their degree programs makes them incredibly credit rich. You\u2019ll see their majors having 40-60 credits in requirements, so it makes sense that they want to avoid too much overlap. But this policy in CLAS is not requiring an extra 30 credits to be pursued such that a student would have to have 150 credits to graduate - remember that most degrees have a decent allowance for regular electives and that major courses can double dip in general studies requirements. The CLAS college policy just means that out of the total credits completed, at least 30 of them have to be unique to a major.",

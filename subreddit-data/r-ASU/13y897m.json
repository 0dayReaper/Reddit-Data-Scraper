I only left some non perishable food behind like sugar, salt, and some coffee powder behind because I believed it'd go as donations if done so and I didn't wanna waste the food material. I HOPE THIS AIN'T THE CHARGE FOR THAT. It makes no sense because we even vacuumed the room and dusted the surfaces.",

            "comment": "My dude, there were food donation bins. Unless the food is in there, it is considered trash at $25 per bag. This charge, in the common space, is split between roommates.\n\nThis is, in part, because they have to call in multiple contractors to supplement the skeletal maintenance staff. Because of the size of ASU and the corporate relationship with ACC (who manages most of ASU residential property), it is near impossible to work with small contractors. Often, these larger contractors come with higher fees because a larger operation always has more waste. Add in a sprinkling of greed from each corporation and it adds up quickly.\n\nThe $30 charge is likely a charge based on damage you did to the wall at some point. It might have been a simple accident. It might not even have been something you noticed, but the use of a variety of products (to patch holes, to texture the patch, to paint the patch, etc...) adds up.\n\nThey are not performing maintenance at cost because they have no strong incentive to. It sucks, but trust me when I say you could have had it a lot worse.",

The second charge could be your share of a community charge for common areas damage that no one ever reported the person responsible. When that happens, they split the cost between all dorm residents.",

    "postText": "Hi! I'm an out of state transfer student from California planning to attend ASU next fall and wanted to inquire on how to qualify for in state tuition.\n\nI'm an independent on my taxes as I'll be working a year prior and have changed my address to my friend's address in Arizona so I can have all my mail sent there. I'm also registering my vehicle, switching over my California driver's license, and switching my voter registration to Arizona. I was also planning on opening an LLC and bank account in Arizona as well. Though, my job will be out of state a majority of the time yet I'll be coming back and forth every month to my friend's place in Tempe to pick up my mail.\n\nIs there anything else that I can do to help increase or secure my chances of getting in state tuition next year?",

You have to actually live in AZ for 12 months in order to qualify. Switching your DL to a state you don't actually live in is illegal.\n\nHowever, you greatly increase your odds of getting in if you can show that you have an AZ lease/mortgage and pay your taxes as an AZ resident.\n\nhttps://students.asu.edu/residency",

(I haven\u2019t attended any football games)",

Depending on if you arrive early, you can get pretty close to the stadium. If you arrive right when it starts, you\u2019ll be a lot farther back. But either way, it is like an 8 minute walk at most or can go even quicker. Luckily ASU closes off parking lots if they\u2019re full so you don\u2019t waste your time. If that does not work, you can park at the Fulton Parking Structire which is where Tooker and the PV dorms are at, that is like a 10-15 minute walk especially since youd probably have to take College Ave and head down north (opposite way of campus), you can always cut through the light rail tracks but as it\u2019s busy with a lot of cars, best to take the sidewalk",

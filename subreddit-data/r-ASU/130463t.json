            "comment": "So the simple answer is NO.\n\nThe more complex answer is kind of.\n\nYou cannot do ASUOnline and ground at the same time.  Where available, you can take icourses (not o courses) in place of in-person classes.  Even if a major is offered through ASUOnline, you may not be able to complete the same major with just icourses.",

ASU Online students don\u2019t have that scholarship option. \n\nThere is a one-time campus change that student can do from ASU Online to immersion/on-campus OR vice versa. But that should be taken seriously as it\u2019s a one-time change and it can affect the financial aid available to you. \n\nAs an on-campus student you take in-person courses and iCourses (online for on-campus students) if desired and available. As an ASU Online student you\u2019d only take oCourses (online for ASU Online students).",

    "postText": "Is it worth it so be an ASU101 section leader as a senior. It pays a $500 dollar stipend for what they claim is 2.5 hours of work a week. How accurate is this? Do I just have to show up to class and grade assignments or is there more to it?",

            "comment": "I assume probably yes there isn\u2019t all that much to it. In terms of the stipend you can calculate how much you make per hour ($500/[2.5 hours x 15 weeks]) but keep in mind that since ASU is a nonprofit institute they can pay under minimum wage. Moreover since it is a stipend they don\u2019t have to pay minimum wage either because you aren\u2019t an hourly worker. But I\u2019ve never been a section leader so I wouldn\u2019t know specific, mainly answering since no one has said anything yet. Seems like a decent gig for a couple hundred bucks tho and it would look good on a CV/resume as a leadership type of roll.",

            "comment": "Here is some advice from 20 years in higher education. If you are not good at math and you want to just get through, stick with 117. If you are decent at math and think you might want to change your major later on take the math course that you feel most comfortable taking. Taking a higher level math course will not hurt you as a journalism major, and can only help you if you decide to change your major later on in your academic career.\n\nThe comment about purposely failing the placement test to get into a lower level math is some of the worst advice I've ever heard.  You could get 100 on the test and still take 117.",

My advice is to binge study MAT 117 over the summer with the organic chemist on YouTube and CLEP out of it for like $100. You\u2019ll get credit and it won\u2019t affect your GPA because you don\u2019t get a letter grade.",

You don\u2019t just take a math or \u201cpick a math\u201d  that\u2019s good enough for your major. . Run your DARS audit on your MyASU page and look and see what math is required in order for you to graduate. If it\u2019s Mat 117 then so be it. You CANNOT graduate until you\u2019ve completed the required math that is listed on your DARS audit.",

If there\u2019s no specific math course required for journalism then yes it\u2019s just the general math class that you test into from Aleks. If they told you it\u2019s MAT 117 then that\u2019s what it is and there\u2019s no need to take it again and possibly end up in a harder math class. And in that case I DEFINITELY suggest to CLEP out of it and save yourself $1500.",

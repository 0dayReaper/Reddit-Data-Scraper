            "comment": "Its just an algebra test if I recall-- so think:\n\n\\- finding the zeroes of a polynomial\n\n\\- solve for x (lol)\n\n\\- slope of a line/related problems\n\n\\- a lottttt of exponents, log, dividing fractions and other tedious arithmetic \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the ALEKS last year (I just finished freshman year) and got a 31 on my first try, then re took it after studying and got a 59 (i needed a 61). I didn't bother taking it a third time lol-- just settled for MAT 117 (which was the easiest class I took that semester) and then moved into my major math the semester after. Point being, dont let this aleks thing stress you out too much like it did with me, regardless you'll do just fine :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you have any other questions about ASU, ALEKS-related or not feel free to reach out to me via DM",

The test covers: order of operations, solving linear equations and inequalities, laws of exponents, solving other types of equations (quadratic, radical, absolute value), systems of equations, word problems (percentages, averages, ratios), imaginary numbers, exponential and log functions, and trigonometry. You may not see all of these topics. It will depend upon how well you do with each successive question.",

The test is multiple choice for some questions, fill in the blanks for others. I'd recommend just giving it once, because you can then unlock the practise modules and stuff to work on your weak topics.",

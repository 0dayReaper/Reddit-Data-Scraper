    "postText": "I have a few questions as an incoming international student at Arizona State University for Fall 2023.\n\n1. What's the process of getting into different clubs and societies at ASU? Are these clubs active (specially clubs related to film, entrepreneurship, and outdoor activities)?\n\n2. How are the study abroad and global education programs at ASU and when are you allowed to go? And how do they work?\n\n3. How are the internship and career opportunities, specifically for a Business major?\n\n4. What resources does ASU provide that you think that incoming students may not know about?",

            "comment": "for clubs there\u2019s passport to asu event at the beginning of the year where all clubs set up  and advertise basically. you can also use sundevilsync. any greek life type societies will be done during fall rush events in the greek leadership village. idk too much about the specific clubs youre looking for but you\u2019ll definitely be able to find them on sundevilsync. \nim engineering so not sure about business internships but i do know that networking will be your best friend. get close to professors who can recommend you to any of their connections, use linkedin, talk to business advisors about best course of action. I\u2019m not too sure about study abroad but i do know there\u2019s a department dedicated to it and im pretty sure they\u2019re in the basement of the MU (?)",

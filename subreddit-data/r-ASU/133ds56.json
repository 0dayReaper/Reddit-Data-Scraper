So they can help with things like extra time for tests, note taking or other accommodations in the classroom. If that's not what you're looking for, can you explain more? Are you looking for tutoring?",

They are going to require documentation for accommodations but they are really good about getting things out on time when you meet the deadlines.\n\nI have noticed that some accommodations will have some professors who want to question you but I have never had any professor cross the line on their questions.  Some professors once they get the letter from SAILS will be more than willing to help you directly if that makes you more comfortable.\n\nOnce you can navigate the online portion of using SAILS its really easy to make sure you are getting the support you need \n\nFeel free to DM me if you have questions that I might be able to answer since I have used them my whole time I have been attending ASU.",

They work with your condition, whether temporary or not, and contact your professors on your behalf about what accommodations you may need. A few of my friends get longer exam times, for example. Also, look into TRIO, they provide additional support and benefits if you're eligible for their program.",

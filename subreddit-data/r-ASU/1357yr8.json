While you\u2019ll hear #1 in Innovation a lot, [we do well in rankings](https://www.asu.edu/rankings) in many facets. There is so much to do and so many people to meet. \n\nAnd for business programs specifically, we are consistently a top 30 business school in the US, best in Arizona, and really [high across the board in other metrics](https://wpcarey.asu.edu/about/rankings). \n\nThere are many companies that come to WPC in search of MBA graduates to hire. If you haven\u2019t already, get in contact with a grad recruiter and ask them for information on where recent graduates have accepted job offers. WPC Career Services is very engaged with getting data from graduating students, so they should be able to get you some info based on the MBA focus that you are interest in.",

It ranks pretty highly across the board, and is a pretty solid pick for most degrees. I had 0 problems with ASU during my job hunt except those created by bad professors not teaching well, but even those are few and far between in my experience, I only had one or two truly bad professors, and one of them was somewhat debatable.  \n\n\nTldr; Nah.",

It's what you make of it.\n\nIt changed my life and I am doing way better as a result of attending.\n\nI hope it serves you well.",

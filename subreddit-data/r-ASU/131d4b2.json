Even more so if you have food allergies or uncommon diets. They do offer limited vegan/vegetarian options.",

They\u2019re expensive for what they are, but I lived on campus every year while I was at ASU (scholarships and so on helped) and I have the 2 meals a day plan every year. \n\nI used both meals basically every day for about 5 years and yes it can start getting a bit tiring (but you just have to switch up what you\u2019re eating or even run to the pod markets and use your meals there)\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who wants the ease of being able to just pop into the dining halls/pod markets and grabbing food instead of running to the store, eating with friends/roommates) in the dining halls more often, and just want that security knowing that for the first year in college you\u2019ll basically always have food (just saying this because some people do have that worry and I met one guy that I used my guest passes on during my Junior year to get him some food for the last like month of the year since he did the M&amp;G plan and blew threw all of the money) I\u2019d say the 2 meals plan works great.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who maybe just wants a quick breakfast before class, or a dinner after all your classes, but then getting to flex your cooking skills or being a bit cheaper with microwave meals I\u2019d say the one a day plan works great.\n\n\nIn the end I\u2019d definitely say it\u2019s up to you and what you think you\u2019ll personally want to use more, if you have any questions feel free to ask!",

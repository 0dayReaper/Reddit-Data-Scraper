    "postText": "I can take only one of either:\n\nCSE 576: Topics in Natural Language Processing with Prof. Baral\n\nCSE 569: Fundamentals of Statistical Learning and Pattern Recognition (Staff for now; Hemanth was a good professor for this, but he doesn't teach this class anymore and Li has taken over for the past few semesters, but does not have good RMP reviews)\n\nCSE 573: Semantic Web Mining with Prof. Davulcu\n\nMy semester will be pretty busy and I need to choose one of these classes. I am interested in ML/AI, but am not great at it. Has anyone taken any of these classes and can provide a review of the class/course load/difficulty/prior knowledge necessary, etc. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!",

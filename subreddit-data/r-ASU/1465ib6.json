That said, the party culture is real and it's easy to lose track of priorities.  Theoretically you could party yourself out of pretty much any school, but at ASU there's something going on every night, so there's definitely more temptation.  I graduated with an engineering degree and my friends who didn't make it used to tell me \"you can redo the class, not the party,\" when the opposite is actually true, especially at ASU.  After graduating, most people I've told I went to ASU, even at job interviews, have referenced the partying, but I don't think it's ever really had a negative effect on me.  I think the combination of an engineering degree and a party school makes most people assume I could balance social life and work, which is a net positive in the real world, where businesses need social employees who are also technically competent.",

Fulton has many supportive programs and so many financial support has been put into it. There\u2019s this new program called FACE which focusing on building leaderships in many aspectS. EPICS also help you create quick resume by allowing you to join project groups working on engineering based community service. There\u2019re many interesting projects you can look into for com sci majors. FURI offers you opportunity to conduct research based on your self interested. Having this experience can greatly boosted your resume. There are many more opportunities you can look into here. \n\nI didn\u2019t start off my college as engineering major so I was lost quite a while to discover these amazing opportunities. I recommend, if you decide to come to ASU, go to the E2C2 camp. I went their as a camp counselor but I realized it would benefit you greatly as a freshman. You can make connections with upperclassmen/women and professors right away and also having a great time learning about people you\u2019ll become friends with in your engineering journey. \n\nOur engineering school produces the highest number of engineering. Imagine the amount of money that was put into investing on us (apart from our intuition), it\u2019s safe to say that ASU is one of the leaders in engineering program.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t regret coming to ASU for engineering degree. All the opportunity and support is there but surely you still need to put your effort too.\n\nIf you\u2019re try to convince your dad, show him the picture of Fulton dorm compared to the rest. It\u2019s sad to say that not all majors are treated equally but engineering students seem to be treated/supported better than other majors, in my opinion.",

I\u2019ve never been the most diligent student and never had the best gpa, but I tested well and knew I wanted to join the workforce. \n\nAs a large college, asu has plenty of resources for research and internship opportunities as well as career fairs. All major tech, finance, consulting, etc companies attend, as well as a fair share of smaller companies. The major drawbacks of cs at asu are:\n\n(1) the professors are hit or miss. Some were fantastic, and among the best mentors I\u2019ve had. Others were unhelpful, uncompromising, and generally unpleasant. \n(2) the curriculum is difficult if you struggle with discipline. I struggled freshman year and quickly had to change the way I approached academics. I found my experience a lot better after creating a routine and structure.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with asu, you\u2019ll get a job if you put the work in and take advantage of the opportunities in front of you.",

Regardless $160,000 in debt for college you figure out what or not you want to do that or not that will answer your question whether or not you go to college at ASU. If you aren't sure you want to go to ASU there are plenty of apprentice type jobs in your field that you could get some hands on training and get paid while you're doing it to see whether it's the field you want to be in.",

These students ruin the reputation of asu by taking easy majors, partying and joining frats. While the minority population of stems students barely have time to eat and sleep while trying to manage and pass their classes. If you ignore the gross 70% of the student population who are business majors or some other type of bullshit, Ira a Fulton school of engineering is top rated among public universities, has one of the largest expenditures for research per year, and has multiple top ranking programs such as CS, EE, ME, Biomed and more. Asu has a great CS program with an even better cyber security program that is top ranked among public universities, and has a great network of alumni and graduate students to help support you in the future. \n\nTldr\nAsu has great top ranked stem programs, but the reputation of Asu is seen as a bad party school and as a whole has been dragged down by the easy majors",

A lot of these kids also come from pretty well to do families so they don\u2019t even care about school. I mean if you\u2019re family is shelling out almost 5k a semester for a frat you got a nice chunk of discretionary income. Idk, I do feel that a lot of the students at asu are unmotivated and kinda negative. Definitely need to be around good influences at this place.",

Engineering on its own as an industry simply would not exist without business development, product facing, marketing, and management people. All I am trying to say is that the only thing you will ever hear about ASU from people who know nothing about it and its multitude of successful and top rated programs, is the following: it's a party school where no one goes to class and people drop out all the time. \n\nIt's our job as students of the school to break these old stereotypes and prove that ASU can truly do great things and the students who graduate from here are capable of driving the world into the future.",

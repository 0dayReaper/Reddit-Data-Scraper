    "postText": "Hey I am going to be taking MAT 142 in the fall I have always struggled with math and haven\u2019t been in a math class in 20 years \u2026.. is this a class I can work ahead in or do they release blocks at a specific time ? Because of work, school, family and life classes that let me work ahead are much needed to be better balanced for me. Thanks for the help.",

            "comment": "Im pretty sure MAT 142 is taken with an online course like ALEKS meaning all your work is done and due on there. So yes, you can always work ahead. To lesser your work, you must do good on the initial knowledge check which is the \u201ctest\u201d that determines what topics you need to work on. If you can do good on that, then it will reduce your like 300+ topics to whatever you need to work on since you have shown in your ikc that you knew some topics already and won\u2019t need to go over it until test time for each unit. A lot of professors won\u2019t even require that you show up to class if you finish all the topics unless you are testing but always check the syllabus just to be sure",

I\u2019m a junior and haven\u2019t spoken with my advisor since enrolling freshman year, I have a 4.11 gpa but mat 142 is is my last needed lower level class and I\u2019ve been putting it off I only need a C , and honestly that will be difficult as I have undiagnosed  Dyscalculia/ dyslexia \u2026. I\u2019m just planning on trying to just get by",

So I decided I might as well take part two, but for the first attempt (part 2) I had an OK score and I'm not so sure about my second attempt. Will it take my higher score? Or will it take the most recent one?",

Not every class/professor allows multiple tries and the grading policy should be outlined on the course syllabus.\n\nIf you're retaking the course in which you earned a C or higher, then both grades will be used to calculate your GPA. Only retaking a D or E grade will replace the previous grade in GPA calculations. XE grades will always could against your GPA. All grades and course attempts after the drop deadline will show up on your transcript.",

    "postText": "I completed my second semester in Spring 2023. I took CSE 120 in addition to my term 2 courses(CSE 205, MAT 266, PHY 101, ENG 108) in Spring 2023 and I was able to handle the homework. I am planing to take CSE 230 in addition to CSE 240, MAT 267, PHY 111 and MAT 243. I want to ask if it is fine to add CSE 230 to my Fall 2023 semester.",

I took 230 this semester along with 240 and it was definitely manageable, but my other classes were relatively easy. Your schedule is nothing but demanding classes that all require a lot of work; it's doable but it'll be a lot of time needed for studying so be prepared to sacrifice your social life lol",

You can definitely do that schedule but it will be very time consuming. Probably totally fine if you don't work, if you have a lot of obligations I would probably swap in an easier class",

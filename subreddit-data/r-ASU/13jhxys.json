    "postText": "Hello!\n\nI am currently halfway into earning 12 credits for the admission requirement (Earned admission courses online) for the Organizational Leadership degree.\n\n*I am wanting to switch into Human Systems Engineering.*\n\nCan I switch my major now or should I bring this up with my academic advisor once I earn admission after 12 credits?\n\nI suppose my main concern is what the GPA requirement is for the College of Engineering. \n\nThanks in advance!",

It\u2019s all about your HS or transfer GPA (sometimes both) and how many credits you enter with to really know for sure. \n\nYou would be an OGL major but not make progress towards that degree, rather you would take courses for engineering not knowing if you\u2019ll be admissible as the GPA requirement is high. In turn you could still be denied admission into engineering and the credits wouldn\u2019t apply toward your major requirements. \n\nIt\u2019s complex and very individualized, so chat with an advisor from both engineering and OGL before enrolling.",

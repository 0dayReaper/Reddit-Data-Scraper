I was wondering if anyone has any insight over the two and if one would be better.  Writing is not an issue for me, but I can be shy during class discussions.",

Highly recommend, there are plenty of chances for extra credit and she\u2019s really good at facilitating an atmosphere that lets everyone speak without forcing anyone. I also encourage you regardless of class to get comfortable sharing during class discussions. That is part of the purpose of this class. I will warn that some of the veganism content can be a bit gruesome. Got an A and A+ if that matters. Best of luck",

In my opinion you can't go wrong with any human event professor, but they all teach a little differently. \n\nNot sure what she covers in 171, but 272 was some American slavery and eugenics as well as some contemporary works about race and wealth. Check out RMP as other comments said.",

Easy A and his modules will actually turn you into a better writer. \nHaving had another Professor for 272 who is both more rigorous and harsh at grading has only gone onto show me how little this all ridiculous BS matter if the most important part about the class is not delivered properly- and even though Fette is occasionally boring (as he doesn't mandate participation from everybody in class), he will ensure you take away good stuff without the stress.",

            "comment": "Um what?? The only reason to stay in Tempe as a Masters student would be if you still want the close proximity to Mill Ave avd student parties or you need an individual room lease situation. \n\nHousing near Poly is way cheaper than in Tempe. The apartments tend toward young professionals, and the residential neighborhoods and newer homes filled with families and retirees. You'd have to qualify for a whole home or apartment on your own though, you find someone renting a room.  \n\nThe area around Poly is safer and nice, it's just not hopping at all hours like Tempe. That is typically a plus for grad students who want a more mature environment.",

It was the right move for me, since I was an international student involved in a club sport team on the Tempe campus and had more friends and things to do there. I love the Tempe campus. But as others have said, it may be smart to live near poly. I found the poly area to be kind of boring, but then again, I never really gave it a good chance.",

            "comment": "I finished my masters in December and lived in Tempe and even though you might have aged out of the party scene from undergrad, Tempe is a way better place to live than Poly if you can suck up the shuttle ride. I\u2019ve lived on both campuses and pre covid Poly was dead (I could go to the Poly sdfc middle of the weekend and I\u2019m lifting with only  4 other people in the whole gym. My friend lived there last year and he confirmed it\u2019s nowhere near as lively as Tempe after classes went back on campus.\n\nHonestly the shuttle rides aren\u2019t that bad they come frequent that if you\u2019re good with managing you\u2019re time it\u2019s not a hassle. I\u2019ve taken classes at all the campuses during my undergrad and while it seems daunting to be on the bus basically everyone is just doing homework on the wifi or relaxing before classes. For me it was a nice descompresor after working downtown and heading home to Tempe campus or after classes or on west campus I took. \n\nPoly would def be the easiest option but if you want the better outside of classroom experience, go with Tempe",

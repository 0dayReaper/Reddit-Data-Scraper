    "postText": "So I did something really stupid, obviously. I helped a friend with a couple questions out of like 30 on an online exam for MUS354, the Beatles class. Like seriously I really dont know why I did it, Im in grad school and I decided to risk that to help a friend for one of the easiest classes at the school. I\u2019m not a big fan of cheating, I just kinda let myself get peer pressured into it. I\u2019m not even in the class myself, just helped them lookup a couple answers.\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling guilty about it and want to hold myself accountable through the school but I\u2019m encountering a moral dilemma. If I report myself and my friend, I am potentially ruining both of our futures over a really stupid, easy exam for a class that is a gpa booster just to take care of my guilt. And I know that there is a ton of cheating with online exams that doesn\u2019t get caught, hell even at one of my in-person exams this semester the professor had to tell everyone to stop talking during it. So it seems like I\u2019d be snitching on us to essentially selfishly get rid of my guilt and likely lose some friends while tons of other instances of (imo worse) cheating happen and don\u2019t get caught, or the professor simply doesn\u2019t care enough to do something about it.\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve heard that professors usually go light on first time violations, which I think would be the case for both of us. For some reason, some part of me wants to do the \u201cright thing\u201d, but I am also looking at the big picture and wondering if the \u201cright thing\u201d really is the right thing. TA\u2019s and Faculty, any suggestions? Should I just let it go?",

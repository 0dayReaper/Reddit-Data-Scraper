If so, set up an account with Coursical - it will notify you when a slot opens. Or just check weekly. It's common for classes to open up the last couple of weeks before the term.\n\n\nIf the class is required for your major and you can't get a section at all (rather than just a time you prefer) email your advisor. Departments will sometimes make exceptions, especially if you need the class to stay on your major map.",

It notifies you with a text message when someone drops out of the course. Or else, contact your advisor about your plans. Or check on class discord servers to find someone to swap with.",

    "postText": "Right now I'm not in a financial situation, but most likely next year since I am planning on getting my Master's in CS.\n\nI am working here at ASU and get tuition benefits for being a staff member. Therefore, I'm taking a few prereqs before getting into the program (did undergrad in Biochemistry). However, I would like to do a thesis because I have research experience on this, but not necessary experience related to CS. Also, I feel like the chances of finding a professor who is willing to fund a Master's candidate (RA/TA) is slim.\n\nThe only options I can think of is to go through a non-thesis route and do MCS online while working (or even better if the company pays) or go through the thesis route and pay in full tuition.\n\nWhile thinking about this, I would be in need of making money regardless. What are some ideas that I can make extra money while in grad school?\n\nEdit: Where I am currently working at would not help me with my thesis since it is in a different school than SCAI so this is out of the option unless if I decide to do non-thesis MCS.

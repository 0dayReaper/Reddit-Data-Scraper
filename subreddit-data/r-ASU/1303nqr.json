I first applied last week and was given the approval today that I will be withdrawn from those two courses. I was just wondering if anyone has any insight on how long it takes for the classes to be removed from your Canvas/ show up as withdrawn on your My ASU",

I would assume you would get the W if they can process it in time but if not, then the grade will be posted first most likely until whatever volume of requests the school is dealing with can go back and reverse it.",

There may be some people who have had compassionate withdrawals in the past but aren\u2019t crazy active on this Reddit page. Otherwise I hope someone gives you an effective answer.",

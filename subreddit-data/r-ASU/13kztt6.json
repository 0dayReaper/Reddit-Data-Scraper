    "postText": "I got accepted into ASU just over a week ago, and I haven\u2019t really been given a whole lot of information on how the school works. I was put into Session A for the summer and I\u2019m just now learning that Session B starts after the first one ends. If i register for Session B classes, will that be another tuition bill since it\u2019s another set of classes and credit hours? Is that how it\u2019ll work in the fall?",

During the year, most take Session C classes, but you can choose Session A or B classes too. Then it is billed at the start of the semester for everything.",

    "postText": "essentially the title. i\u2019m quite sad :/ they said all the slots have been filled. it\u2019s my fault for applying for late but it\u2019s because i didn\u2019t know if i wanted to just take a year of doing research and just applying for my phd next year or to do a masters first. \n\nthey did offer me to transfer my application for the online format to be considered with a fee waiver though. should i just do it? i don\u2019t know much about the online format for psych ms and if it\u2019ll help me with getting a phd",

            "comment": "The online format is no different than the in class program. The only difference is the distance learning. If you have the self discipline to accomplish work outside of the traditional classroom setting. I am currently an online PSY student and I love the format. The professors/ TA\u2019s are great. Office a hours are available class availability is more open than in class so you will almost always get into the class you need. PhD programs are only available in person so if your goal is to get into a PhD program, completing a masters online will better your chances at getting into a PhD program since you will have the research knowledge and experience. The online masters program also allows you to apply for a teachers assistance/research program with a professor of your choice, if the professor approves. I say you apply for the online program since there is no fee and then make decision once accepted or not! Never hurts to try.",

The online program only offer capstone course options. Meaning, the students writes a review paper on a a research topic of their choice. The course is heavenly dependent on research and statistics. Have you spoken to an academic advisor regarding your concerns? They might be able to offer more information pertaining to this. If pursing a PhD is your end goal, building strong relationships with your professors and assisting them with research, in person or online are both extremely important in order to raise your chances at getting into any PhD program as they serve as great references and sometimes are kind enough to cite you and include you as authors in publications.",

Or if you completed it, do you feel it has been fulfilling and what job prospects have you been considering or working on using the degree? I'm looking into the online program but insight from on campus welcome as well! Really, any insight you can provide for your view or experience with the degree or even similar majors otherwise is appreciated.",

All the professors I've encountered so far are wonderful people who genuinely care about the students, and there's room to grow creatively into whatever you lean toward with the different emphasis.\n\nIt's a major for creatives first and foremost, so keep that in mind. If you're not a fan of making art, it's not the major for you. If you do like art, especially art made digitally, then you'll probably love the major.\n\nSome of my favorite professors are: Seth Thorn, DB Bauer, and Kimberlee Swisher. If you get a chance to take a class with any of them, you're gonna have a great time.",

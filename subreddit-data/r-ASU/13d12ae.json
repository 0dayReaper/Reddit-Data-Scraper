So what are some subjects which I can breeze through without having to spend double digit hours per week.  \n\n\nCurrently what I have taken  \n\n\nCSE 515 - MWD - Under professor Canden (supposedly very tough)  \nCSE 551 - FOA - Under professor Gennaro De Luca. (relatively easier courses)  \n\n\nI can still swap these classes. Thanks in advance.",

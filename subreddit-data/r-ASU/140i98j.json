Worst case just say you won\u2019t pay for something that isn\u2019t true\ud83d\udc4c",

But also, if you call the community housing department, they can\u2019t actually do anything. I emailed someone named William Royal (I was in Manzy). Don\u2019t know who else is in charge but you have to email the ones higher up in the community housing.",

I was able to get out of a one year lease because of an arsonist trying to burn down the adjacent town house. We caught the first one Chrjstmas Eve and put the fire out. They tried to blame us too. The other times we didn't know about. They also had no fire alarms in the building. That last part broke the lease for us and we didn't pay anything when we left, despite the threats from management. \n\nAlso, welcome to real-world renting.  It's a terror and you will get these charges for all kinds of crap and they will fight you and win in court....but they know you can't afford a lawyer and it's small claims court anyway.",

By the looks of it the administration of ASU housing is having issues...\n\nEdit: I looked on Amazon and the prices for trash cans are unusually high, I guess I am out of the loop. I have an uneasy feeling about all this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess someone's yacht needed extra repairs this season LOL\n\nGotta plant new grass on my billion dollar mansion ahhh LOL\n\nwhy not make the students and the workers at ASU housing pay for that!",

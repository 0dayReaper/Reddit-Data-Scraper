My dept is aggressive in letting us know what can happen to the students if we don't get grades in on time. That being said, there's likely never going to be a penalty or anything. I never wanna fuck with student's money if I can avoid it, takes 20 minutes to get grades submitted.",

Such as removing the option to buy out of teaching the next semester. \nThe professors I see that are late with grades the most are the ones that regularly buy out of most their teaching responsibilities.",

            "comment": "That's not a \"resident\" fee - it's the tuition charge for taking undergraduate (UG) classes in the summer term.  The word \"resident\" is just clarifying that the tuition you are being charged is the lower arizona-resident tuition rather than the higher non-arizona-resident cost.  I think you'd read it as \"This is tuition for undergraduate arizona-residents on tempe campus for session B/C classes in the summer 2023 term\"",

It sucks for me because the classes I have set up and already approved for 2023 are based around the classes I\u2019m in now. Plus I got a killer internship I\u2019m apart of and they said I could either drop it or another class. No way in hell I could do that. Shit has me mad.",

            "comment": "Congratulations! Looking at these comments of people bashing you for picking ASU over Purdue. As someone who made the same choice, just thought I\u2019d offer a bit of perspective from the \u201cother side\u201d.\n\n(Engineering major) I also elected to stay with ASU vs Purdue (albeit for my case, ASU simply made more sense financially). I don\u2019t regret it one bit. I made a lot of good friends and connections here. I still got a good job. If you play your cards right, university won\u2019t make too much of a difference. Best of luck with your studies!",

Just keep in mind ASU is not known for education and earning an ASU degree does not have that much value when compared to the ridiculous tuition fees it charges. Plus ASU is known to milk money off from International students and I even heard they are planning to increase tuition fees this year specifically for international students only from this Fall semester onwards.",

You'll learn nothing and end up just trying to get through the classes than learning anything.\n\nThey cut the semesters in half but don't abridge any content. So you have to read 180 pages and take 3 quizzes every week for some classes.\n\nIt's great if you don't give a shit about learning and just want the degree though.\n\nGood luck!",

Not a total scam \ud83d\ude01\n\nDefinitely not a fan of ASU eliminating session C for their online math courses. MAT 211 forced me into an \"all or nothing\" mode. Shit was rough. Got an A in the end, but I wanted to be able to relax and take a B or B+.",

I STRONGLY recommend applying to Barrett (hmu and I'll tell you how I got my fee waived) even though others call it a scam because it opens you up to opportunities that are difficult to get otherwise",

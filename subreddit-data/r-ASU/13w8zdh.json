    "postText": "Can someone provide information pertaining to language programs at ASU.   \n\n\nI am vet with GI benefits and want to dedicate a year to learning a new language and culture (primarily southeast Asian). I already have a masters degree in International Relations from UArizona so I'm sure some credits will transfer over.  \n\n\nAny information would be appreciated. TIA",

            "comment": "Are you also pursuing another degree or certificate in order to use the GI benefit? \n\nThere are some language minors you can check out, but you have to be in an undergraduate major in order to pursue a minor. There are a couple certificates that you could check out to pursue on their own, like the [Asian Studies certificate](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/minors/major/ASU00/LAASNCERT/asian-studies) or [Korean Studies certificate](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/minors/major/ASU00/LAKORCERT/korean-studies). \n\nBut pursuing a [minor or a certificate related to a language](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/minors/major-list/keyword/Language) is going to likely take at least a couple years, especially if you are starting at no knowledge of the language. \n\nIf you just want to learn a little bit of a language, you can check out what\u2019s available on the Class Search. For immersion/on-campus students, most 101 courses are in the Fall and then 102 in the Spring. Then you\u2019ll see the 201 in a Fall term and the 202 class in Spring. If you are doing ASU Online, there may be different availability. Also, Chinese/ standard Mandarin (CHI) tends to have more availability for the lower division courses than less popular languages like Korean (KOR) and Japanese (JPN). \n\nIf you want to continue learning a language you already have some experience with, check out the [placement exams](https://silc.asu.edu/student-life/academic-advising/language-testing/placement-testing-undergraduates).",

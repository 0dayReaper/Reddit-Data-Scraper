They pushed me to use my third attempt to qualify for MAT265, but I told them I wasn't comfortable skipping over a fundamental course that I have demonstrated a lack knowledge/memory etc. Just push off an elective and take the extra math class now to set yourself up for success later.\n\nI was lucky to learn from other peoples mistakes when they tested out of certain math classes because they had a good enough knowledge to pass the test, but soon found out that it's all building blocks and they had a poor foundation.",

    "postText": "Hi\n\nDoes anyone know about the Los Angeles campus? I got placed at the LA campus for Fashion. I was wondering what were other people\u2019s experiences there? How\u2019s the social life? Are there dorms?\n\nI know ASU is now partnering up with FIDM, so possibly the ASU Fashion Program will actually be on FIDM\u2019s Campus with their dorms? Please just let me know if anyone has any info on anything pertaining the Los Angeles campus, dorms, FIDM x ASU collab, and etc.",

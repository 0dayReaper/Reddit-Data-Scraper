    "postText": "Hi everyone!\nI\u2019ve been a barista at Starbucks for roughly 3 years now and I just recently decided to return to school.\nI\u2019ve been considering taking advantage of the \u201ccollege achievement plan\u201d benefit in which we can take online classes from ASU to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree but wanted some advice/input.\n\nSome info:\nI\u2019m an art major. I want to go into character design or something illustration related. I checked the online programs for ASU and saw they didn\u2019t offer any program that really suited what I was looking for so I decided to just go to my local community college with intentions to transfer to university later on.\n\nI\u2019ve recently been having a bit of a crisis (in terms of what I want to do with art in my future) and long story short, I\u2019ve started reconsidering whether I should just take advantage of the benefits I have and go to ASU (mostly to save money on tuition costs). Specifically whether I should go into the graphic design program.\nI\u2019ve been told by others that it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of art degree I have if I\u2019m trying to get into the art field and that, if anything, I can just take extra classes (outside of university) on the side to get more experience with other things.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s bugging me is that I would obviously need to attend online because I live in California \u2026 Which does suck (for me) because I do somewhat care about the social aspect of college (like, having experiences you could only get if you\u2019re there in person).\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s bugging me is that I can\u2019t find tooooo much information about the online graphic design program or how good it is.\nI don\u2019t want to take classes just to get a degree, I want to actually learn and grow as an artist .. so I am a bit worried about the quality(?) of the online program/classes.\n\nHas anyone taken graphic design at ASU (specifically online) or do you know anyone who has? Does anyone have any advice or suggestions for what I should do? Any replies would be greatly appreciated!",

Look into the Studio Art minor, it has multiple paths to completion, one may apply to you specifically. See you in (online) class, should we end up in the same ones.",

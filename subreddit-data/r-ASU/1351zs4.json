I feel like VT has better programs but ASU's honors college might give me an edge for internships and jobs. Do you guys think Barrett is really that helpful?",

            "comment": "Barrett isn't really useful for most of the major engineering programs aside from the priority class registration. Even then, many engineering students drop Barrett for upper division courses that are a lot less competitive to get into. Barrett is like a premium add on, you don't really need it but it can give you certain advantages or additional opportunities. If you put in the work, you'll get internships and jobs whether you're in Barrett or not. What matters more is how involved you were in extracurriculars and external projects, which there are plenty of in the engineering school. It's still a networking game when it comes to getting internships and jobs so joining your major's engineering society and other engineering clubs can lead to these opportunities. I don't know which engineering discipline you're looking at but there's pretty something for everyone.",

It also gives you concrete reasons for engaging with faculty and diving deeper into academics (honors contracts and the thesis). What will make you stand out is engaging with faculty, taking advantage of the opportunities, and getting more experience and involved. \n\nI\u2019ve done several in-depth breakdowns of Barrett in this sub before, so feel free to search my prior comments.",

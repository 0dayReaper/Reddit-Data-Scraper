    "postText": "Hey again ASU Redditors,\n\nI wanted to say thanks to all of the nice people who helped me out in my last post with my concerns about attending ASU in-person! I have a few more questions for you guys -\n\n1) Any recommended clubs/organizations to join on the Tempe campus (or Downtown since that's close?) I went on ASU Sync and joined a bunch of interesting ones, but I'm curious to hear which one(s) you guys really enjoy/enjoyed during your time there. I prefer clubs that are generally active and have cool people.\n\n2) I was potentially interested in joining a sorority. It's not really been my scene before, but I figured, why not do something different? Anyone have any experience with that or recommendations on a certain group? If it's not good or has a lot of drama and fighting, definitely let me know. I did read up on it and it sounds like it's had quite a checkered history.\n\n3) Lastly, I am looking at getting a Global Management Master's degree with Thunderbird. It looks great and has good reviews from what I've seen, so I feel very certain about it. But I'm curious to hear what others' experience with it has been and learn more about the overall educational experience and post-degree job market (especially in regards to how easy or hard it was to obtain one with this kind of degree).\n\nThanks a lot! :)",

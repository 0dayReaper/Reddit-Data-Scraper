    "postText": "Little confused on what to do here. I graduated last week from ASU. I start a masters next week at ASU. My ASU still shows a hold to wait for my bachelor's so they won't start working on my fin aid package. I have no idea what to do and I doubt they'll have it ready in time, but does anyone have any suggestions? It says it takes up to two weeks for a degree to post but I won't be able to start the program without it posted.",

The holds on my account are admissions so I still need to reach out to them to remove the hold then fin aid to update them that my package can be processed.",

Until yesterday there was a hold for conflicting FAFSA info for any graduate funds due to my status still showing undergrad in progress. Until my bachelor's was posted, they wouldn't generate a fin aid offer whatsoever.",

They have to update my status with dept of Ed and they have to update their records then tell ASU etc... She said it'll likely be two weeks max but to try to work out something in the interim since tuition is due next week.",

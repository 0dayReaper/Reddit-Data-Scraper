    "postText": "Hey all! I'm an incoming freshman and I wanted to inquire about church options.\n\nI know all of the stuff behind Hope so you don't have to warn me about that. I'm just curious if you guys have any recs for a non-denominational church with a modern atmosphere that still stays true to the text. Preferably in Tempe not too far from ASU. That said, I'm not opposed to other places. I'd just have to find a way to commute.\n\nIdeally the church would have a ministry for young adults and college students. I'd like to meet people around my age with similar faith. If you're aware of any, just let me know. So far I've found Redemption, Church on Mill, and Central AZ.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

The college ministry does a lot of volunteer work and social events, and there\u2019s a number of young adult core groups to connect with.",

Also download the valley metro app because it maps out all the bus routes and is pretty detailed",

You can learn more information about the beliefs on their website, but overall it's super chill. They also are connected with a church called Deserts End and willing to drive ppl if needed on Sunday.\n\nAnother group is Navs, or the Navigators which is also on campus. They're super nice! Mostly know of them because my sister was a part of their group. Mainly just wanted to find my own group so that's why. And I believe their connected with Grace church too.",

It's Southern Baptist based. \n\nAnother great group is the Young Adults division at University Lutheran Church. They are very welcoming and don't push hard on any specific agenda even though they are not specifically non-denominational. There are special worship hours &amp; Bible studies, plus a weekly \"family\" dinner and other outings. The church is literally next door to Vista del Sol housing, across the street from Hassaysmpa C. \n\nCRU could be an option. I've heard mixed things, but you can check them out for yourself. I believe they actually are non-denom but might not be an actual church, just worship study.",

It took my i-20 under 1 week to arrive after I submitted my documents. Meanwhile you can fill your DS-160 and be on the lookout for slots. There is some news on slots opening in the middle of June. If you are lucky you might get a slot in the nick of time. Things will be cutting pretty close though. \n\nMaybe you can consider going for spring if you are able to find an interview slot.\n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "Pretty much impossible tbh\u2026 it\u2019ll take at least 2 weeks to to get the I-20, after which you\u2019ll need to complete an in person interview. There are 5 consulates/embassies in india, and, as you might imagine, many many Indians trying to get various visas to the US, particularly F-1 visas. Which means, most interview appointments for the next couple months are booked up already. The biggest issue is that you need to complete your interview at least a month before the first day of classes (for fall 23, that means you need to complete the interview by July 28th). This is because it takes a couple weeks for the visa to be processed, printed, and sent to you and students are not allowed to enter the US after the first day of classes. The first day of class is mentioned explicitly on the I-20. I hope this made sense, feel free to DM me if you need any more info!",

Assuming you are a self funded student, so VO will definitely check you financial document. You might need at least 40 days to get visa after all those administrative checking.",

            "comment": "its possible, last year I got admitted around 15th of june, and then my i20 got sent through my email week after, you just gotta figure out the interview in the embassy cuz if they give you later date, you need to request emergency interview where you have to be prepared to send all of those documents to the embassy and they will consider if they should give you earlier date most of the times they do. I got mine first for 22nd of august but after i requested for the emergency they moved it for 1st of august. So yeah you need to be focused only on that for the next couple of weeks.",

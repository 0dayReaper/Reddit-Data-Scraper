    "postText": "I had differed from ASU Spring 2023 to Fall 2023 and forgot to apply for a new I-20. My task list didn't mention that I need to apply a new one. I finally realised my mistake and applied for it last week. Given that the classes start from the first week of August and limited VISA slots, I'm worried that I might not make it this Fall. I raised this issue with the Admission services and haven't received any help from them so far. What are my options in this situation? Can I use the SEVIS Id from my old I-20 that I got for Spring 2023 and start with the VISA appointment?",

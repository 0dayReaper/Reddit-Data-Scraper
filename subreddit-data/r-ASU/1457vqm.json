I am going to give my ALEKS test in a day or two , and I have some queries .\n\n\u2022 Is it Difficult ? I\u2019ve heard a lot of mixed responses from people , some saying it\u2019s easy , others saying it\u2019s super tough . \n\n\u2022 What is it\u2019s syllabus ? I\u2019ve heard some people say it\u2019s just basic algebra stuff , while others are saying it contains pre calculus too . \n\n\u2022 I couldn\u2019t find a lot of material based on the test . Are there some practice tests or modules y\u2019all can help me with ? I would truly appreciate it \n\n\u2022 and lastly , how is the test conducted ? Is there something I need to know regarding this ?\n\nAny type of advice and help regarding these questions would be appreciated . Thanks",

I\u2019ve heard a lot of mixed responses from people , some saying it\u2019s easy , others saying it\u2019s super tough .\n\nQuestion start easy and get progressively harder.  The more correct answers you provide, the harder it gets.\n\n&gt;\u2022 What is it\u2019s syllabus ? I\u2019ve heard some people say it\u2019s just basic algebra stuff , while others are saying it contains pre calculus too .\r\n\nWhole Numbers, Fractions, and Decimals\r  \n\r  \nPercents, Proportions, and Geometry\r  \n\r  \nSigned Numbers, Linear Equations and Inequalities\r  \n\r  \nLines and Systems of Linear Equations\r  \n\r  \nRelations and Functions\r  \n\r  \nInteger Exponents and Factoring\r  \n\r  \nQuadratic and Polynomial Functions\r  \n\r  \nRational Expressions and Functions\r  \n\r  \nRadicals and Rational Exponents\r  \n\r  \nExponentials and Logarithms\r  \n\r  \nTrigonometry\r  \n\n\n&gt;\u2022 I couldn\u2019t find a lot of material based on the test .

I would truly appreciate it\n\nNo proper practice tests for the MPT, you should be able to find practice problems on the topics listed.  After you have taken the test, there are some study material that are available.\n\n&gt;\u2022 and lastly , how is the test conducted ? Is there something I need to know regarding this ?\n\nLast I heard (its been a few years), this test was taken from your computer and proctored with a camera and microphone.",

Learning and getting proficient with Revit while in school will make you far more employable, and Revit still doesn\u2019t work great through a Mac compared to the PC. I studied architecture at ASU and currently work at a firm and my best advice is to learn the software that will get you jobs.",

            "comment": "I have a strong biased towards Windows machines vs Mac.\n\nI know you said you want a computer that will last 4 years. I would suggest a different approach. Buy a cheap machine that will get you through your first two years and let you see what you will need for your upper level classes. As I said I am biased towards windows, but I would recommend saving your 1500 to $2,000 budget for after your second year.\n\nHere is my general advice after 20+ years of working IT at ASU.\n(This is based on saving money, if money is not an issue, go hog wild)\n\nFind a used Dell Latitude or Lenovo Thinkpad with a 10th gen or better i7 CPU.  I have had Dell Latitudes (and supported them forever, they are not gaming machines, but will do your class work perfectly).\n\nIf you are the least inclined, upgrading the storage (call it hard drive/SSD etc) and RAM is pretty easy.\n\nA 1TB SSD is ideal, Matlab and other software packages are huge.  2TB isn't a bad idea if it won't break the bank.\n\n16GB RAM should be the minimum memory.\n\nTowards the end of your second year, plan on buying a nicer new system to complete your last two years.",

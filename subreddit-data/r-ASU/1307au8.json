            "comment": "Bro, this is a blessing in disguise. Don\u2019t lease at any of the ASU dorms. Just get a lease at nine20 or vertex or something. Do you really want to be waking up to fire alarms at 3:00 am multiple times a week. Also the hallways smell like piss, you have to bring your own lamps if you wanna be able to see at night, and not a single window opens. The people in those buildings are total assholes bro. Also can\u2019t even remember how many times I got sick in that bitch. Like the ventilation is pure dogshit. You aren\u2019t missing out on anything by not housing there. Quite frankly, Hassy can suck my dick and lick a nut too. Hayden and Best are straight poverty dorms so that isn\u2019t a good bet either. Not saying the student housing apartments are perfect but it\u2019s a HUUUGGGEEE upgrade from the shitty asu dorms.",

Honestly just get on a waitlist somewhere and hope if it comes down to it. From what I heard anyone that applies after the end of April isn\u2019t even guaranteed housing this year or something",

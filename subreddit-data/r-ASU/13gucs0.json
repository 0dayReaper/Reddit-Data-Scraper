            "comment": "Yes you can, I just did!!! I did online and took advantage of the program they have set up with Starbucks. I came from the coast of NC and everything was super smooth! Had a few minor hiccups only because I don\u2019t know the area bc i\u2019ve never been to any of the necessary places before but when I needed a little assistance I just asked someone who was in their cap/gown and everyone was helpful!! (Or I found a staff member). I registered for ceremonies/commencements by the deadline so everything went smoothly there and the main big issue I had was my gown didn\u2019t fit after I received it in the mail so when I got into town I immediately went to the bookstore to exchange it for the right size. Even though I did feel like a little bit of an outsider I had the best time. I attended the undergrad commencement and the Herberger Institute specific convocation and got to walk across the stage for that one! If you have any questions let me know!",

I\u2019d advise scheduling a call with your advisor so they can make sure everything thing is good academically since DARs can have glitches sometimes. And they will also walk you through what will happen at graduation and answer any questions. \n\nI\u2019m the big convocation, you won\u2019t walk across the stage nor have your name called. You will have to attend your schools specific convocation and you will be able to walk across the stage on that one.",

This is where you get up and walk across the stage and they call your name. During the beginning when the dean was giving his speech, he had people stand up who were online students, working, are parents, first generation college grads. It was really nice and awesome. There were a ton of online students who stood up! I think attending convocation finalized graduation for me and it felt like \u201cI\u2019m actually finished\u201d. 10/10 recommend.",

I sat in a row that was mostly empty near the front (they told us to sit in the front) and a few seats away from a girl who was by herself. I asked if she was saving them for anyone and if she minded if I sat there. She was also by herself! An in person student but none of her friends were in the same college as her. We talked the entire time. Everyone is there for the same goal\u2026. To celebrate the ending of the incredible experience of going to university and finishing.",

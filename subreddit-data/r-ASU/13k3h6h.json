    "postText": "**Background**\n\nI work in ABA been in the field for 7 years. I want to get my BCBA. That is primarily for the autism community. I've seen it limits to the degree so far.. I could be wrong but you can work in home aba therapy, aba clinic, I wish I knew more about aba in schools. I don't know of any bcba's being board certificated behavior analyst and using it for other jobs. (If you know of any BCBA who use behavior plans in different work environments let me know!)\n\nI have experience as a mental health tech where I worked at a crisis residential facility. I liked working with all walks of life and other mental health disorders besides autism. I like aba but I want options.\n\nI move a lot due to my partner being in his residency and life is a little unpredictable so ASU online works for me.\n\n**Education**\n\nI am finishing my BA in Psych\n\nASU has a program Masters of Arts in Special Ed- ABA where I can get my BCBA.\n\nProblem is... I do not want my masters in special ed because I do not want to be limited to only working with the special ed population. I want to be able to do multiple paths if I chose in the future.\n\nASU also has a graduate certificate in ABA graduate certificate. You can earn it while earning another masters degree. This was going to be the route I want to take.\n\n**My Question sort of.**\n\nI want to become a BCBA now but in the future I want to be able to use my BCBA cert with a combo of another masters to possibly branch out.\n\nI want the options to maybe work as a counselor of some sort. Work in schools maybe as an advisor not sure. Maybe in the hospitals as something but unsure what yet. Basically the path is unclear but I want options.  I would have loved to be a speech pathologist but I am not willing to add more classes to my undergrad. I would have loved to by a physical therapist but I do not want to go to school that long and am not the best at research course/science etc. \n\nI love helping people and learning new things. I love psychology and I just want a good career in the future. I want to be able to have opportunities and change is okay with me. I know there is more careers and jobs I do not know about. I just want the education that allows me access to those jobs.\n\nIf there are jobs you know about let me know.\n\n**Masters Degree?**\n\nAnways my thought process is...I want my BCBA for now but in combo with what masters...\n\nThese are the ASU masters programs I'm looking at? Suggestions are very considered lol\n\nI don't know if people can do much with just *Psychology MS?* If I'm wrong please correct me.\n\n*Positive Psychology MS* seems the coolest and something I'd enjoy the most but what can I do with that and have you heard of what people do with that masters?\n\nI am leaning towards *Social Work MSW?* I've met a few social workers who worked at the residential facility and I believe you can do a lot with that degree correct? I do not want to work with the aspect of social work where you work with kids in the foster care system and reuniting them with their families that to me would be really hard. When I worked at the crisis unit seeing how dark the world is is not easy. Any other options with a social work degree?\n\nFamily and human development MS? Not sure what that is but maybe?\n\nEducation masters?\n\n What masters path are you taking in psych or social work and why???\n\n**I'm open to any advice and guidance. I know it's easy to talk to ASU career support people but I feel like psych majors are either working in the field and might be able to support me in a different way. Thank you!!**",

                    "comment": "I understand the criticism of ABA and I\u2019ve come across some companies that are very much a money train which is very unfortunate. I remember working at one once for less than a week and I\u2019ll tell you why. I came originally for one that I was at for 4 years and I loved it they taught me well. My supervisor was a bulldog for those kids and always had their backs when it came to being involved with the schools making sure everyone was trained she was really hard on us her heart was huge. I didn\u2019t think I was getting paid right which was the case since my experience and title went up so I left. Okay the first place was a disaster\u2026 I worked with primarily medical which is Medicare kids and know my fair share of immigrants families and I never had an issue with them being token advantage of. So new company I went to an aba company who accepted private insurance and the family was in a nicer neighborhood but they were immigrants. I believed the husband knew English but the grandmother and mom didn\u2019t. That\u2019s who was home when we would work with the client I worked with the client he was let\u2019s say around 10 and she literally wanted me to babysit him. That was all we went up to his room there was cameras which I don\u2019t care about that they took advantage of the fact they didn\u2019t speak English. I brought it to my new bcbas attention how much he knew and his programs being ran were a joke. She didn\u2019t challenge him at all. At all it was so sad. I immediately went to my car and cried because I didn\u2019t know this could happen and this was real. I told my bcbas and other supervisors what he was capable of and the stuff I probed so push him a little to help learn to read or use his words more etc. they got irritated with me I quit. So yes there\u2019s bad in aba but there\u2019s so much good. I have seen so many kids excel and do so well in school and they no longer hurt themselves or others the lists go on and on. I\u2019ve taught kids how to talk how to deescalate themselves. How to do basic life skills I\u2019ve supported with them eating 1 food to now eating nutritional things. Psychology has its flaws and there\u2019s an ethics board. To say all of them are good is a lie but there are great aba companies out there that really do help these kids and adult so much. So I hear what you\u2019re saying but to kinda say my life\u2019s work has been controversial I\u2019d disagree with you. The instructors and BCBAs I\u2019ve come across have hearts of gold and 90% if not more could not have the patience and compassion to do what we do.",

Because it honestly has so much data backing how when done ethically how much it changes lives.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI got some questions I was working on a Master's with ASU in Emergency Management (Online) and I had to leave because a law school accepted me. I finally am at a point where I can go back to finish my degree. My undergrad GPA allowed me to go in no problem but my JD I had some stuff happen in my personal life that caused me to fall in Academic Probation and I will graduate with my JD with a mid GPA under 3.0. The question is will it affect my reapplication process because the major I was in says it looks at \"undergrad GPA OR applicable master's degree.\"\n\nSecond, if anyone can tell me how to best prepare for Grad School again I would greatly apppreciate it.\n\nEdit: My Master's GPA was really good which I hope balances my more lack luster one.",

As for honorlock, it's not bad. Scan your rook, take the test and that's it. Would a C session math class been better? Yeah. But an A or B is doable as long as you have no friends or life or Job.... kidding, get it done, put the work in and in 7 weeks be happy you knocked it out.",

            "comment": "They all use honor lock now.  It is set at the department level.  It's doable but count on really spending at least 10 (maybe 20) hours on that one class each week.  Significantly more (maybe 30 hours) if you are not very good with college algebra and precalc.  Most people would be far better off taking it during the C session.\n\nAlso looking ahead: between MAT211 and Discrete Math, I personally found discrete math to be easier.",

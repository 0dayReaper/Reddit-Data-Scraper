However, in academics you can\u2019t get fired for being a pile of garbage. So yeah the project still gets done and some people don\u2019t do a damn thing. \n\n360 group project went like this for me: one person dropped the class I think, another straight up said no when I asked him to do something, just anything. So me and one other person wrote the entire project while meeting up for pitchers of beer at Postinos. We made the best of a shitty situation, but screw academic group projects, holy hell.",

            "comment": "To answer your question, I don't think it really matters which one you pick. It's roughly the same workload either way. I took 360 in Fall 2022, and 365 in Spring 2023. Here's a little information about each class:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n360 - the only professor for this class is now Lynn Robert Carter. In the past there were other professors, but now you're stuck with this geezer. Check out his RMP, I think he's got a 1.3, which is deserved. He cannot answer simple questions, he's condescending, his tests are impossible to study for, and his lecture material is taken entirely from a different professor. The bulk of this class is your group project, which is multiple phases, and each phase will involve a lot of writing. Only near the end of the semester do you actually start working on writing the software, and it's all done in JavaFX.\n\nI took this class last semester, and it was rough, but not too time-consuming. However, I heard he made it more difficult this semester, so who knows what it'll be like next semester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n365 - this class is interesting. I took it with Connor Nelson, who was a good, knowledgeable and friendly professor. Next semester it's offered by Adam Doupe, who I have heard a lot of good things about. \n\nEverything was live-streamed on Twitch so attending lectures was not necessary. Your entire course grade comes from completing challenges on the dojo ([dojo.pwn.college](https://dojo.pwn.college)). There's a new module every 2 weeks, and each module you have to learn a new skill (netcat/curl for http GET/POST requests, intel x86 assembly, reverse engineering with ida/ghidra, cryptography, etc.). The amount of time you will spend on each module varies, depending on if you have experience with the technology already, and how quickly you can learn what you need to know. \n\nFor this class, going to recitation helps a ton! They do some of the challenges for you and you can get help if you're stuck on something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, 360 will probably be more work, but only because the class structure is more confusing than 365, and it's not obvious what you will need to study for exams. Also, the group project might take a substantial amount of time.",

If the housing you want is off campus, the loans will still go towards your school bill first. If you took out $10k in loans, but your tuition is $6k, that extra $4k will be deposited into your bank account/sent as a check for you to use for whatever which includes housing if you\u2019re smart with your money and using it for sensible things.",

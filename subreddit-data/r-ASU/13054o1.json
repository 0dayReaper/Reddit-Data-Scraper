    "postText": "I\u2019m a transfer student and i took roughly 65 units in community college but a good chunk of those units doesn\u2019t count towards my degree. I know asu has a 64 unit transfer limit from community colleges but does that include classes that don\u2019t count towards my degree? Or would ASU count the 64 units from the amount of units i\u2019m using for my degree excluding the extra classes i don\u2019t need. I want to try to take a couple more community college classes if im able too.",

(Ex. using ENG 101 and 102 to fulfill the FYC requirement)\n\nThe 64 credit limit for two-year institutions affects how many credits can be used to help you fulfill the 120 credit minimum requirement that all bachelors degrees have. So you\u2019ll never have more that 64 credits count toward that requirement, meaning that at least 56 credits must come from four-year institutions. \n\nThere is also a separate requirement that at least 30 credits of the 120 total must be completed at ASU.",

If it\u2019s not for your degree it will count as an elective since your major map usually has at least ~30 credits of elective classes. And like you said the limit is 64 so I believe you have to choose which ones you want to transfer but I\u2019ve never transferred credits so I wouldn\u2019t know 100%",

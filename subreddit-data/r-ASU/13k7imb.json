There\u2019s also a waveform generator that is also from Digilent. In addition, you also need a multimeter, and breadboard which can be from Amazon.",

EEE202 and EEE334 (circuits 2) will use this kit, EEE335 (analog and digital circuits) was all through SPICE software, EEE360 (power systems) has its labs through matlab simulations.\n\nThe only outlier is EEE333 which is a hardware design language class (FPGAs) which you [will need this thingy](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=1021)\n\nIm not too familiar with the other pathways and tech electives though",

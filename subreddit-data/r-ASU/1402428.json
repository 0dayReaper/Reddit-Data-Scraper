    "postText": "Just graduated with a master's degree in Industrial Engineering this May. I am 24 years old so there's no way I can show 3-5 years of \"demonstrated work experience\" required by most companies as a minimum requirement. I have applied for the EPICS program but as a voluntary position, one can't possibly handle monthly expenses. Worst part is my specialization in Operations Research which is required by federal organizations and one needs to be a U.S. citizen to be able to apply for that. Anyone in the same boat?",

Software is the worst for internationals (especially indians) because 80 to 85 percent of applicants for those jobs are indian. Because of this companies have figured out if the majority of software employees are indian then they can just open an indian office.",

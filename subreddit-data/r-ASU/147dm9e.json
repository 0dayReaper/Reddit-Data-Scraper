My RAM was 16 gigs, but it works pretty well on 8 too. If you\u2019re trying to future-proof, then go with 16 because you can\u2019t upgrade RAM or Storage later.",

I saw lot of comments about issues with m1 air but all the comments were old and i want to know if compatibility issues are now fixed. \nOne major issue people mention is virtual box. I am into networking and for all networking classes virtual box will be used. Did you ever try it?",

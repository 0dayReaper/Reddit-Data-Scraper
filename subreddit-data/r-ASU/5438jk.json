The last thing I recall was staring at the figure's imposing red eyes and pointed beak before I passed out.\n\nWhen I awoke, my laptop had vanished from my desk, and in its place was a notice that my parking meter had expired.",

We made a list of (almost) every accessable porn site on campus and counted the number of people getting caught jerking off over an hour period. We did this for morning, midday, and afternoon intervals (nighttime is a non-issue, almost everyone squeezes one at night). \n\nThe next criteria was location but that really just depends where your classes are. \n\nThe final factor was quality. Nobody wants to use a site that is slow, riddled with ads, or doesn't have enough college creampie compilation videos. These factors and others were taken into account when we analyzed the porn sites. \n\nAll the data was input into a spreadsheet and then ranked from 1-55 (we had 55 on our list). \n\nAt the conclusion of our project we found that staring into the open windows of Adelphi I was the best, undetectable porn experience at ASU.",

It got to the point where normal porn didn't do it for me anymore. I started looking at shemale porn, midget porn, BBW porn, fuck I even started jerkin it to anime porn from time to time. My mind was goin weird places. And its not even that I wasn't getting laid. I was getting more pussy than I've ever had in my life. I got home from having sex one night and immediately jerked off again. Anyways, after all of this long history of porn watching I was approached by my CA and he was holding this stack of papers. He pulled me aside and showed me the papers and it was a list of URLs of all of these porn sites. The URLs were clear as to what kind of porn they were too. BBW this, Tgirl that, Anal, Lesbian, Clown, Midget, etc. My CA said \"Do you know anything about this? It's registered to your ASU ID.\" \"I said yeah, that was all me. Am I not allowed to watch porn?\" To which he replied, \"No you're fine, just turn the volume down from now on.\" ",

While many streaming sites have full videos available for free, there are a lot that aren't available in full length, especially new movies. The other reason is quality. Not all streaming videos have crisp, clear quality. Torrenting gives you the option to watch your favorite movies in 1080p. Another reason I can think of is if you have shitty internet speeds. Streaming isn't a great option for everyone. Leave a couple good, lengthy videos downloading overnight. Now you have 5-6 hours worth of HD porn to wank to over X amount of time without having to deal with stream buffering and shit.\n\nFor more please check out my New York Times Best Seller....",

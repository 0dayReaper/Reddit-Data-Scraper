            "comment": "ASU Health Services is a primary care office. They have general practitioners that you can see to talk about your mental health and get a diagnosis from them. They can prescribe anti-depressants and other types of mental health medications or they will give you a referral to go a psychiatrist, a doctor that specializes in mental health specialist, in the community. ASU Health Services doesn\u2019t have psychiatrists at their office.",

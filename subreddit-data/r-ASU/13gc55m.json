    "postText": "So I received an email last night telling me that I no longer actually graduated this Spring semester. I had applied, been approved, passed my final semester with flying colors and four days after graduation I'm told that I am 1 credit hour short. My guess this is because of a duplicate English 102 from my other colleges that has been there for over a year since I transferred. Taking my 122 credit hours to 119. How is this ok? Should I dispute? Having been here for over a year with those transfer credits there, being told I'm all set to graduate this spring only to be told four days after graduation that it is no longer true and I need to apply to take a summer course that starts in three days? And I doubt I  even do that class because I'm going to be out of the country for multiple weeks starting in like five days! Any suggestions on what I should do? Please help I am desperate.",

Some colleges may even waive it if you can prove you were told you were fine by someone from that college.",

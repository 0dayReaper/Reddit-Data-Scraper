After Smith's death in 1844, the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang.**\n\nMore details here: &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormons&gt; \n\n\n\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

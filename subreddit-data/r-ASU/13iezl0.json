It was four years of pure freedom that you don\u2019t realize to later in life.  I am  32 years  from college life and I think about it at least once a week.",

Once we know it\u2019s ending, we tend to glaze over the effort or struggle it took to reach it. \n\n\nSo you didn\u2019t \u201ctake advantage\u201d of your college years. That means entirely different things to different people. But you DID graduate and accomplish something life changing! Pour any residual nostalgia into making the most of today. You\u2019ll find most things in life require initiative, very few good things happen in passing.",

Also if she still does them, go to class and do the iclickers!!! It\u2019s really easy points! the lab I found to be a little difficult because it\u2019s all writing papers but you should reach out to your lab instructor if you have questions because personally for me it was all very new and a little challenging \ud83d\ude05 I ended with a B!",

It\u2019s all conceptual and learning about research methods is not the most fun but she does try to make it entertaining with using real life examples. GO TO CLASS!!! You\u2019ll understand it way more than just looking at her slides. I personally did not read the book once and did just fine on her tests. I ended with an A. Her study guides are her learning objectives, she doesn\u2019t make a separate study guide so make sure you understand every objective before taking the test. If not, she has office hours and is very helpful use it to your advantage!!",

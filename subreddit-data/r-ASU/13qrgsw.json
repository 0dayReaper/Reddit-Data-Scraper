    "postText": "Hi, I'm a rising sophomore studying Psych. I talked to my advisor about study abroad and she strongly recommended doing study abroad either during junior/senior year and I just want to know if anyone else has done SA as a psych student? Are there programs you recommend? \n\nAlso how does FA work? I'm in-state so I pay 5k for a school year but the websites say that the programs can be up to 50k? Honestly just looking for some past experiences and what your thoughts are!",

I recommend applying for it.\n\nActually housing varies wildly depending on where you go.\n\nIn Taiwan, housing was so affordable I was shocked, same with Nanjing and Beijing. But I imagine it will be much more expensive in the Euro zone.\n\nYou should study abroad, just research to make sure the program you choose supports your major. Don\u2019t fall into the trap that many students do in going out for drinks and acting carefree all summer as failing a summer course will adversely affect your studies and definitely impact future scholarship opportunities. Just go, enjoy the local culture, remember that you\u2019re a guest in their country, and make real effort to get away from the expat/student areas and get to know the people in the place you are!\n\nBest of luck!",

            "comment": "Do NOT do study abroad in Senior year, unless you don't need credits. It takes time for the foreign transcripts to get to ASU and be processed, so going Senior year really messes with your last semester or graduation date. It also gets much harder to find classes you need to take, since major related classes are less common overseas, so you end up only being able to do Global Flex, which is living overseas while taking iCourses instead of taking classes at that university. \n\nIf you want to go during the school year and not Summer, the Spring semester of Sophomore year works great or Fall/Spring of Junior year. In terms of Housing, Spring semester is better. If you live on-campus, you can cancel your contract for Spring. If you live off campus, there's a much better chance at a sublet in Spring than in Fall. Otherwise, you have to pay rent while not living there. \n\nIf you pick an Exchange program, the tuition is the same as ASU and aid applies the same. There might be a program fee added, up to $1000 on average. You would still need to pay for housing &amp; expenses too, just like at ASU, plus travel expenses. If you pick a Partnership program, you pay whatever the actual cost of the program is. \n\nHave you been to the Global Education Office (GEO)? That is who advises on and arranges study abroad programs. You should go speak to them. They can tell you about travel scholarships too. You can also look at the available programs and associated costs on their website. Semester at Sea has been popular this year.",

    "postText": "I am asking this because the referees of recent intramural volleyball games were extremely unprofessional. They didn't understand the basic volleyball rules and seemed to rule in favor of a specific team that consisted mostly of players from the same country as the referees. Several examples can show how outrageous the officiating was:\n\n1. The referee of our semi-final allowed our opponents to dictate the selection of the game ball with a made-up rule that the game ball selected by our opponents was the official ball of the game. Literally everyone except for that specific team hated that ball so much, but every time, when that team was playing, the referee would side with that team and force everyone to use the \"official game ball\" with a made-up rule that is nowhere to be found in the ASU intramural sports handbook.\n2. He called centerline violation on us when our players stepped on the centerline and the referee insisted that he was right. The whole team of referees--the first and second referees and the line judges--did not understand that partial crossing of the centerline is permitted, which is a rule that has existed for decades despite all the changes. And to make things worse, their made-up rule only applied to us when players from both sides stepped on the line constantly throughout the whole game.\n3. A ball that dropped inside their court was ruled out, and after the line judge clarified that it was inside their court, the referee and the line judge somehow collectively decided that the referee couldn't change the ruling simply because we protested. That begs the question: what do we even need the line judge for? Fyi, making and changing the ruling based on line judges' opinions is common in volleyball games.\n4. During our game, one of our opponents caught our service and stopped playing, which is a clear violation and we should win the point, but the referee decided to make us replay the point because, as our opponents claimed, \"we stopped the game because you guys were not paying attention.\"\n\nMy question is: is it a common problem in intramural games or just in volleyball? The whole referee team was unprofessional and there simply is nowhere to complain about the situation.",

Same goes with basketball, there\u2019s been so many times they literally don\u2019t know the rules. It\u2019s whatever. You just have to set your expectations low and be grateful to have intramurals at all",

            "comment": "It's a problem across other games too, we had indoor soccer where the ref was giving hand balls for shoulder touches and body touches. He even gave a penalty after the keeper got the ball. He said the keeper was outside the line hence a hand ball, but in soccer the ball needs to cross the line doesn't matter where the player is.\n\nThe refs are usually in thru references and rarely have any idea about the rules of the game. If u ask them about the rules they have no idea. There just there to blow a whistle.",

    "postText": "I'm gonna be a sophomore next semester and I've been riding a skateboard to class the past 2 semesters but since I'm living somewhere with a gated in bike rack I wanna start riding a bike to class. My question is what are the chances that my bike gets stolen during the 1~2 hours that I'm in class at the tempe campus?",

If you get a nice U-lock and a thick cable, just run that cable through both tire rims terminating at the u-lock, and make sure the u-lock is around the FRAME of the bike.  Most students don't do that, so your bike won't be the one targeted.\n\nThe big thing is that, if your bike is outside at night... anywhere in Tempe... it will get stolen.  Most likely within a year.  Doesn't matter what kind of lock, doesn't really matter where.  If it's outside, thieves will find it and use crazy tactics getting it.  They will pick the locks, they will use airbags to pop open U-locks, they will cut through the metal piping of the big bike racks, and on occasion I have seen them pick up the \"smaller\" outside bike racks at apartment complexes and just load the entire thing onto a truck and drive off with half a dozen bikes still locked to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't have an apartment that has a locked bike room, or have the ability to put it in your apartment... it's probably better to just skate.",

I've gotten my bike stolen, and my boyfriend's gotten two stolen, but all those thefts were at night. Minimize your chances of getting burglarized by making sure your bike isn't too expensive, and keeping it in a well trafficked area.",

            "comment": "On the note of locks, a) make sure to lock through the tire and frame, or frame at minimum, and b) all locks are not created equal. Many people get their bikes stolen because they lock just through the front tire or something, and that's all that's left when they come back. Lockwise, avoid anything by masterlock, pretty much anything they make can be opened by shims or a sharpened zip tie. Combo locks as well are pretty universally trash. Good disc detainer locks or higher end keyed locks are the way to go; do your research on locks and remember that a good lock is just as much of an investment concern as the bike.",

Register your bike at the asu cages for if you ever need to leave it overnight. I\u2019ve been doing this for 2+ years and had no issues. 99% of bikes are locked on the front wheel only with just a cable and then wonder why they get stolen. If you bike is locked better then all the bikes around it, the thieves aren\u2019t gonna go for your bike. And yes don\u2019t leave it out overnight. I either keep mine in the cages or inside my apartment overnight.",

That being said, my roommate got two different bikes stolen from our old apartment complex even though she double locked it each time and our complex was gated. I\u2019d say go for it as long as you have a way to keep your bike INSIDE your place.",

You want to make your bike harder to steal than the others around it, so also lock it up near some less secured bikes. Don't leave it unattended overnight, nor ever get lazy on locking it up properly and you'll be mostly fine. \n\nYou gotta pay to play tho, a good u-lock (e.g. kyrptonite fahgettaoutit) plus a thick steel cable (10mm+) is going to cost 100-150 bucks and weight 6-10lbs. If you have a longer commute, then it can be worth the cost. If that sounds too expensive or like too much work, then walk or get a skateboard and don't let it leave your side.",

    "postText": "Hey guys, so recently I was admitted into the NGSC at ASU as an incoming freshman! I am excited to join but also, I am a Barrett Biology student. I also want to join Greek Life. I just had a few questions regarding the NGSC and was wondering if anyone could help answer\n1. Does it require a lot of time commitment?\n2. Are the required classes difficult? \n3. Is it an easy organization to work with?\nThanks! \ud83d\udd31",

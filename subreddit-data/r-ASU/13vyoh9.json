    "postText": "I am attending ASU WPC this fall and majoring in Marketing (Digital and Integrated Marketing Communications) and might pursue a certificate in Applied Business Data Analytics\n\nI am thinking of joining some business clubs at ASU to have some good extracurriculars and learn more about my field. I am thinking of joining DECA and the Strategic Marketing Association. I also might join one or two more clubs like Economics and Finance Association or Financial Literacy and Market Economics to see if I like those subjects and want to either switch major or double major in something like finance or accounting. \n\nI didn't do any clubs in high school and am looking to have a fresh start in college. Is it good to join these clubs if I am kind of a beginner to business and want to mostly learn or just explore new fields?",

            "comment": "I would suggest finding the clubs at Passport to ASU (big club fair that happens during welcome week) and sign up. A lot of clubs don't really require a lot for membership and people can come to specific events they are interested in. Some clubs are going to have applications for membership and be a little more involved but you can learn about them and decide what you are interested in and have time for.",

There's this marketing club (I forgot the name, lol) that allows you to travel for certain sales competitions. Look on Sun Devil Sync and if they have a constitution/Bylaws that were updated for fall 2023 they're going to be having meetings/events.",

At least in my experience, constantly hearing marketing topics kinda made me dissociate  \ud83d\ude05 plus I\u2019d make sure that you get through the first semester alright before joining a lot of clubs!",

Don\u2019t quote me on this but I believe most clubs on asu are open to anyone joining just cuz of how many people are interested in a topic but don\u2019t necessarily want to major. Ik with some marketing clubs I was in there were people from different WPC majors but just had a tiny interest in marketing. Just know that joining clubs not in your major won\u2019t help you network with people in the same circle. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing!",

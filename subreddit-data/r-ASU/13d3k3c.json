I am not sure if he will keep the same course load for the next semester because i have heard of other people getting more than one project in 310. Simply put, do your best on the homework each one is 5% of your grade. the midterms are VERYYYY similar to the HW he even tells you which HW problems are gonna be similar on the midterm. He did pull a gestalt on us for the final though and it was significantly harder so there is that. The project is pretty simple if you understand how to code in c++. My friends started it a week before it was due and they were fine. he gives us almost a month an a half for the project and his TA's were helpful. I also forgot there is a bunch of recitation assignments you will have to do but those were Incredibly simple. All in all happy that I had him.",

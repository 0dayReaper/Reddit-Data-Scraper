There\u2019s a reason he has such a high RMP score and hundreds of reviews. \n\n(Bear in mind, this is all pre-Covid info)\nHe has his own gapped notes/mini \u201ctextbook\u201d that he makes and is pretty cheap. Records lectures, posts notes, own hw site, etc. His class structure is one of the best and really caters towards those who are motivated to learn. Exam material is rarely something brand new.. all fairly similar to hw problems or class examples. \n\nI only have good things to say. Respect the hell out of him. Solid guy/prof.",

He even had practice exams from previous years which, again, we\u2019re very similar in format to the real thing. I went in very nervous because of the reputation of the subject, almost considered taking it at a cc first, but I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t.\n\nBest of luck!",

It\u2019s still very hard as it\u2019s a lot of work but there\u2019s no question what you need to know to do well. \n\nThere is a whole homework portal where you\u2019ll do about 800+ problems throughout the semester and he gives you like 3 practice exams prior to your actual exam that are set up the exact way your exam will be.",

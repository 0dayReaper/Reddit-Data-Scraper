Yes, it\u2019s required for you to attend, but it\u2019s also a great way to get involved. Business clubs in general are where you will meet some of your closest friends and can find people to study with and register for classes with. They\u2019re like-minded people who want to excel in academics and learn more about different aspects of business. \n\nReally take it all in!

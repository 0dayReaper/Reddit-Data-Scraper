    "postText": "I\u2019m currently in high school, and am looking to go to college in Arizona state. I want to be a primary care sports medicine physician, and would get a bachelor\u2019s in kinesiology here. I also hear that the kinesiology program here is very strong and this is also a great school for pre med, are these true statements?\nAn additional note is that I am a non Arizona resident, so I would have to pay out of state tuition, however I\u2019m a strong student, and would have a strong chance at academic scholarships if there are some good ones.",

It also might give you time to get residency here and ASU is good about accepting credits from Maricopa Community Colleges. \nAside from that I think ASU\u2019s SOLS is great I did pre med there.",

Most are capped at 24, 40, or 60. \n\nAnd for science courses at the downtown campus, while there are more than 100 students in a lecture, it\u2019s usually about 24 for the lab component, which is where the student has to more actively engage anyway.",

I'm in the pre-med here, it's okay, there are definitely all the classes you could ever need/want to take. Depends on what you're looking for specifically.",

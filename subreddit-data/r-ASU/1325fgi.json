    "postText": "Due to covid, the operating systems( CSE 330) course of my undergrad was turned into pass/fail without a grade and consequently that course is shown as deficiency course in my admission letter. I intend to petition agaianst this. But meanwhile, I had some queries regarding course registrations.\n\n\n1. Can I take a course like CSE 545 which has a prerequisite for a course like CSE 330 if I have a deficiency for this course?\n2. In the MS handbook for CS with thesis option, it shows that I am \u201cRequired\u201d to take one 3 credit course for Foundations, Applications and Systems. Can I choose any of the courses from the above mentioned list to complete this requirement?\n3. It seems some courses like CSE 539 are considered both Systems and Applications. If I take this course, will I fulfill the requirement for both Sys and App? Or will it be just one and in which case, can I decide which one?\n\nTIA",

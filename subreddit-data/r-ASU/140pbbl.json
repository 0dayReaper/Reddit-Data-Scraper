But also look at cost of living and such. ASU tuition may be less costly but if costs for rent+food+entertainment+whatever else is much higher in Tempe/Phoenix then it may not be the best choice financially.",

Total tuition cost for asu is under 10k for 4 years since I got presidents scholarship versus at IU Kelley it would have been about 200k since I only got 7k a year scholarship. IU Kelley is higher ranked but the only reason to go to an expensive school for undergraduate business is the drastically improved chance of following the Investment Banking/Consulting path. IU Kelley unfortunately is not a \u201ctarget school\u201d, so it\u2019s not worth it. It would only be worth it if you were comparing ASU to an Ivy, nyu, Georgetown, uchicago, or Berkeley (among others I\u2019m forgetting). Save your $ and go to asu, ESPECIALLY considering you don\u2019t have direct admission to Kelley.",

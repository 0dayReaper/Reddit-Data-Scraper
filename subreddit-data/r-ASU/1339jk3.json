If your unable to complete a UG prerequisite for MS CS that's highly relevant to the program, they also will not grant an additional conditional admit, as, without any offense, there's no reason to do so. I'd recommend taking it if it's offered in the summer, or consider another MS. That isn't a poor option either, and may save your effort, time, and debt.",

The problem is that the program i started and got admitted to conditionally was/is part time program and i could easily manage/handle and pss two Graduate courses with good grades but this UG Course is kinda more than full time stuff. Again thank you for your response.",

Were it a capability issue, they wouldn't really be able to do much, but you're describing more of an overload which is really just a scheduling/logistical issue.",

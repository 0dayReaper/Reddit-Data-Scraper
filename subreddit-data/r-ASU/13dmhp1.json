    "postText": "I need to take CSE 310 this fall semester. My options are Xuerong Feng which reviews were not the best and Nakul Gopalan. Currently I cannot find any reviews from professor Nakul. But his seats are already half way filled. In comparison to Fang which has 2/107 anyone has feedback from these professors?",

The class is out of 105 percent so it\u2019s very possible to get an A. She teaches kind of fast sometimes and I had to refer to the textbook to understand some topics but overall it wasn\u2019t too bad.",

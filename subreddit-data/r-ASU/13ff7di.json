I also don\u2019t know who my advisor is. Sadly this class raises my credit hours from 14 to 17 so I was wondering if I could remove it with the class registration thing alone.",

The social studies class may be tacked on to fulfill a letter requirement (SB, SG, L, HU, H, C, G, etc), so if it's not explicitly required for that semester or on whole your major, you can most likely switch it out with another course that fulfills that letter requirement. For most ASU scholarships, it's 30 credit hours/yr. My past year was 18-14, whereas a typical year may be 16-15 (depends on major).\n\nI was enrolled in SWU 250 initially by admin and changed it out for another class.",

I thought I was on the right track but when I spoke to an advisor they adjusted my classes and thankfully I don\u2019t have to take two of the classes I thought I needed, I would\u2019ve wasted so much of my time!

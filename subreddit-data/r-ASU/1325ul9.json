Professor didn\u2019t answer an email I sent about an injury, even though it says to email him in the syllabus. (TA was great.) \n\nIs that the norm? Definitely regretting this a little.",

Classes that are electives or are for other requirements (like humanities) basically have no involvement from any staff whatsoever. I'm not even sure anyone was actually grading my assignments.",

I had a professor that didn\u2019t ever answer my email but a friend finally got him to answer them. Usually you get responses from professors that teach core classes but like someone else said electives is where it\u2019s worse imo. If it\u2019s something that you think is pretty important you could ask your advisor to contact them if they don\u2019t respond. Sometimes it takes them a long time to respond, did it say anything about response time expectancy in the syllabus? Also, this is probably obvious but make sure you\u2019re emailing from your school email.",

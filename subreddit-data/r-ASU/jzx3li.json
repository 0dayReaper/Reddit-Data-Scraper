It's refreshing and usually it's a good time to catch up on material and generally not stress the fuck out. Especially when you've been taking classes over the summer, because when you take classes over the summer they are more intense than a regular semester. This semester, ASU administration decided to cut the semester by 1-2 weeks mid semester and decided to cut fall break from this year's curriculum. So if you took summer courses then you're stuck in this endless loop of work with no break. \n\nSince you just started, normal semesters are not supposed to be this intense. Infact I find a regular semester to be enjoyable, personally. But this semester in particular I've been working overtime on all of my classes just to struggle and it's cut into my time to function as a human (i.e. sleep, make food, eat, procrastinate, etc).",

Session A and Session B are shorter so they accelerate the amount of material you learn which isn't recommended for classes like, calc 3 for engineers, since the course material is intense as is. \n\nYou can continue to take session A and B courses if you want, even after the covid stuff is over. All the power to you for being able to do it! \n\nThe problem alot of people have with this semester is that intense courses that are meant to be session C have been accelerated due to ASU administration choices which makes classes like calc 3 for engineers very overwhelming. I could easily keep up with it with no issues if it were the only class I was taking but I have a full-time schedule on top of it and I don't want anything lower than a B so my GPA doesn't tank. \n\nI'm sorry to hear that you lost your job!\n\nEdit: I made the same point twice lol, so I took out the second iteration",

C's get degrees but A's and B's open up opportunities. \n\nYou can definitely pick up some fast paced classes if you think you can handle them but the \"norm\" is session C since the material is spread out through the semester. If you're really serious about finishing up your degree I would schedule an appointment with your advisor and figure out a plan to move you in the right direction to graduate.

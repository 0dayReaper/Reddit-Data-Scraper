I was going to suggest fun stuff but I'm old now and I am a mom and there are some things that are super helpful to be aware of so that you don't die prematurely.  So please read this and keep in mind that even though you're not my kid, I worry about all kids and I want you to be happy and healthy and thriving. So I do apologize that this is maybe a bit of a buzz killington comment but it is in the name of motherly love. With that, \n\nIs there a gym there? Weightlifting can be really fun and there are so many benefits. \n\nYou could catify your space by getting those mini shelves and your kitty can climb them and you can put a bigger shelf with a bed on it? \n\nYou can write a letter that will be treasured forever by your family just to let them know you're okay and how you're doing. \n\nGive yourself a spa moment by drawing a bubble bath, applying a face mask and do a thorough pedicure.\n\nYou can volunteer at so many places like the Humane Society and snuggle with a lonely distressed pet before it has to die. \n\nYou can get creative and plan healthy food kits and prepare it weekly to eat so you don't get malnourished with the highly processed toxic chemicals that some people call food end up eating in dorms. \n\nWhatever you decide to do, please don't go on a hike. It's too hot and every year people die. The whole dry heat thing is crap. It's freaking hot! . When going out to do regular things or for any reason at all, don't leave the house without a water bottle and have a hat protecting your face and wear sunscreen and reapply as needed. \n\nAnother thing about Phoenix to watch out for  is that drivers are in a massive hurry and they do not look out for pedestrians or bicycles. Never ever ride a bicycle in Phoenix ever. \n\nIf you ever hike in the desert and this means this whole state even if it's a mellow paved \"trail\", bring needle nose pliers because there are these cactus balls that will just about jump out from out of nowhere and once they attach themselves to you, if you pull on them, they have barbs that burrow deeper into your skin and it hurts so bad. You can't get them out with your fingers.  This happened to me at the JW Marriott on the paved trail on the golf course and thank god I was able to find a man who was golfing that happened to have pliers.  \n\nI do hope you find something to fill your time that makes you feel good.",

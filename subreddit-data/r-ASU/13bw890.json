    "postText": "I just finished CSE240 and while I enjoy the programming and do pretty well with it, I'm starting to feel unsure about other aspects of this degree. Math is a huge struggle for me and I didn't pass Calc 1 this semester. I honestly have no clue how I'm gonna do 2, 3, Discrete, and whatever else is needed. I'm also really concerned about finding internships or a job as it seems very oversaturated at the moment.\n\nI want to stay in tech though and while looking around for other degrees I stumbled onto CIS. I'm not really sure what it's like as none of my friends are taking it, so I thought I'd ask here first. Is this basically just a glorified IT degree or can you actually get a decent job with it? From what I understand it starts out with business and then gets into databases and analytics. I'd love to hear more from anyone who's taken it!",

It's not a bad option at all, the degree is slightly less good but it really doesn't seem to hold people back that are truly interested and put in the work on the non math stuff.\n\nYou can also try sticking it out, I barely made it through Calc I and II through going to the tutoring center like, 3x a week. Discrete is not easy, but for people who aren't good at math it should feel less foreign, it's a lot of logic type stuff. Calc III you can take a replacement class for that is way easier and not mathy. Linear algebra isn't a breeze either, but they have labs and homework you can do well on and still have room to shit the bed on the tests. I had heard bad things about probability and statistics but I didn't have trouble with it.\n\nBoth the degrees can do a ton of other stuff that's not just dev work. I'm a business analyst now and I don't code at all, and hiring doesn't seem to have slowed down for them either.",

Both majors will have some overlap into each other. Overall I feel like I could have a higher technical knowledge in CSE but I enjoy being a part of WP Carey and having more opportunities to network. I landed a pretty decent internship with the major and I know some CIS graduates who are doing well for themselves.",

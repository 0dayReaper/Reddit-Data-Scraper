Those petitions can take a few weeks, so at the earliest you might get an approval in time for Summer Session B. \n\nContact your advisor to ask about the petition process. If they say you don\u2019t need a petition, then they are likely just new and will need to connect with a more knowledgeable colleague to provide you information on the process.",

So they said it would take too long to get approval for summer which sucks since my advisor didn\u2019t say anything about this even though she checked how many times I\u2019ve taken this class. I just emailed that specific advisor to see if she could possibly streamline the process since she said I would be fine but it\u2019s looking like I\u2019ll be here another semester.",

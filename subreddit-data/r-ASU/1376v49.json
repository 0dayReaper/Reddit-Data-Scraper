Better. way less conceptual and more pure math. i would say that i actually enjoyed that class, but it may also be due to my professor. but overall, the transition was great and 266 presented actual math rather than concept. whichever you prefer",

            "comment": "MAT 271 and MAT 266 are interchangeable courses. You will learn very similar content in both courses. \n\nMAT 271 is mostly for Mathematics, Secondary Ed, and some Science (Chem, Physics) majors and it's more of a general Calculus II course.\n\nMAT 266, on the other hand, has more focus on application in engineering concepts. You may find yourself easier in MAT 275 later on. FSE usually will give credit for 266 if you take 271.",

I know you guys can't give me exacts but I have 80k in scholarships and was wondering how much more I should aim for in scholarship as to get just enough to pay off my education and not taking any extra.",

The 23/24 prices for dorms were just posted online. \n\nTuition increases at least 3% every year. Dorms are for Freshmen only, so you'll have to sign a lease off-campus next year. Those range from $1100 to $1500 per month with utilities added in. A 12 month lease is required too, so that increases Housing about $4000.\n\nSo if you don't plan to live at home, $135k is a reasonable in-state estimate for 4 years. Plus general living expenses.",

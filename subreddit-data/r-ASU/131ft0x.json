Idk if it's in person this year but I hope this helps.",

The absolute best thing you can do is be as detailed as possible about your test scores and any expected incoming college credits. That will help your advisor ensure you are enrolling in the correct classes. \n\nFor the second term and later, you\u2019ll sign register for classes on your own through MyASU. It\u2019s a really good idea to meet with or at least touch base over email with your academic advisor once per term. And do it a few weeks before registration opens in order to ensure you have a plan for the next term\u2019s classes by the time your registration date comes up.",

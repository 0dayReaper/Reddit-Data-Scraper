I believe it\u2019s possible for these publisher platforms to provide benefits to students, but rarely does that benefit exceed the enormous price. If publishers charge $20 for access, that might be reasonable. But they charge hundreds for something that can usually be replicated with some hard work on the part of the professor on Blackboard or Canvas or even Google Drive. \n\nIf universities want to show they care about costs, they should be working harder to build more advanced courseware in house that they can provide students. If they can\u2019t, then they should pay the licensing fees for the courseware themselves and cut salaries in accordance with the reduced workload for professors. Students shouldn\u2019t be paying thousands of dollars only to show up on Day 1 and find out if they want to pass they need to pay some more to the people writing and grading their homework. \n\nThey should also restrict the access of publisher representatives. They buy you lunch and even send you on vacation if you adopt their courseware in your class (I was literally offered this). When you have one person with the power to direct hundreds of thousands of dollars a year towards a company, corruption is a guarantee.",

We were told that we needed to set a baseline against which the Provost's project could be compared. For many instructors, this meant setting students up to fail so it could seem like Provost swooped in and fixed a problem that doesn't exist.\n\nI hope this kicks off a larger investigation into schemes like this at ASU especially SER 334 at Poly. Last semester 35-40% of students either dropped out or failed. That tells me the instructor/school is failing, not the students.",

From what I can tell, you are very intelligent and honest.  While I\u2019m sure there may be a lot of talk going on, I feel that this is a serious issue, and I have had suspicions that this is going on in other departments as well.  Because of that, I feel confidant that there is definitely something shady going on behind the scenes and it is worth sharing regardless of the fact that no \u201cofficial\u201d statements have been released.\n\nI am an accounting major and there is very clearly a \u201cbaseline\u201d in some ACC classes for how many students should fail.  One of my professors stated so outloud in class one time and it was clear that the course was designed to fail students and then curve their grades at the end of the semester if they had demonstrated an unstated, ambiguous amount of effort.  I am also minoring in Spanish and even in my Spanish classes there is clearly some corruption in what materials are being forced on students.  Students are forced to used these online portals for many classes beyond economics and whether they are being required by the professor or the university does not make it ethical, obviously.  I think this is making a big splash around the ASU community and I\u2019m sure for the time being, it is more than satisfying and fulfilling to be sparking such a movement.  On behalf of everyone who has been scammed by the collaboration of ASU and textbook companies, thank you so much for putting your ethics and values at the forefront of your endeavors.\n\nI recognize that your AMA was more than a few hours ago but I would like to leave you with a few questions.\n\n-Will you be updating us on your side of the story as things unfold and the story develops?  If so, where can we look for your official testimonial?\n\n-Have you taken any legal recourse against the university or at least considered consulting with a professional regarding ASU\u2019s decision to terminate you?\n\n-Beyond sending an email showcasing our awareness of the situation and asking for change, is there anything else we can be doing long term to apply pressure for change?  Obviously this is has been going on for a long time now and it likely an issue that spreads across many departments and many universities across the nation.\n\nThank you in advance for your time and commitment to this issue.  I wish you the best of luck going forward\n\n-A Concerned Student",

Writing syllabi for older book versions, doing their best to say without saying \u201cyou don\u2019t need that $150\u201d book to giving away promo copies of books the publishers gave them (I paid for a semesters books selling one on Amazon) \n\nI rented this book for $30 only to find I HAD to have the mindtap software. To be fair the professor tried to accommodate those who couldn\u2019t afford it, I get a stipend from the GI bill so I wasn\u2019t loosing anything but fun money. The software sucked and just tried to up-sell academic DLC. \n\nIt\u2019s bullshit what these people are doing. Some folks go into serious debt to get an education. These companies are scared of textbook rentals. When I started my college journey back in 2001 the bullshit was \u201cmust have current edition\u201d of book where nothing changed but a few paragraphs. Now it\u2019s \u201cget our bundled software or your grade suffers\u201d. \n\nFuck mindtap and keep fighting the good fight.",

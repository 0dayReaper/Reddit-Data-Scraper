    "postText": "Hi, currently an online student, and I have some questions that I hope someone has experience with. \n\nI live in South Korea rn and I have a dual citizenship(Korean and American), my advisor said that if I wanted to, I would be able to switch to on campus whenever I want and/or graduate on campus. I was wondering if spending my senior year on campus would be worth it (in terms of expenses and experience)? Would it just be better to finish my entire degree thru ASUonline and not on campus? \n\nMany thanks and happy monday.",

I\u2019m 22 and have classmates in their 40-50\u2019s with related field experience. This isn\u2019t in your favor as it reduces a possibility of a curve.\n\nBut, it could be different in psych, the program should be simpler even if you face those challenges.\n\nI\u2019d say try in person, see how it goes, and if you can afford out of state tuition to be in person go for it.",

I work as a tech in the aerospace field, so I'm hoping it will be a bit easier with that experience.",

Unfortunately I don't really know much about earned admissions, but I know there are others on here that do. \n\nIn general for an online degree, know your due dates, check your classes daily, and don't trust the gradebook in Canvas, always follow the syllabus and calculate your grade independently. This is because a lot of faculty are shit at setting up the grading scale for the course.",

I know for me I really value in person courses and hearing lectures live, so I chose not to do online. However if I had the chance to go live abroad I would probably trade in-person classes for that experience lol. Which country do you plan on living in once you graduate? If its Korea then yeah maybe switching it up in Arizona for a year could be a nice break \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

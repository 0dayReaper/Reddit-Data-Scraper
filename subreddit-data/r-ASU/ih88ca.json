I walked all the way down to the school just now to study in the library and found a sign on the door saying the library just closed at 5pm when it was supposed to be open till 10pm according to the hours. I have went in there in the past and the library certainly has enough room for people to social distance. When I went down there last time, there wasn't a single person in my row with me. I like to go down there to study at this time cause my neighbors in my apartment are very loud. The libraries are not an issue and the university shouldn't be going out of its way to close down places for students to study.\n\nAs I was heading back early from the school cause I thought the library would be open during its scheduled hours of 2-10pm, there was huge protest of 300+ people blocking the road and chanting \"Micheal Crowe has got to go\" so I don't think the student body really likes him. I would like to see him go to.\n\nMy cousin valet parked for Crowe in the past. Crowe was a jerk to him when my cousin told him he went to ASU, Crowe ignored him, and Crowe didn't even tip him despite being a multimillionaire.",

We all need to understand that there students out there who live in toxic or abusive households and can't afford to pay for rent at another area so being in a dorm is their only option.  Dr. Fauci has mentioned and warned a lot about abusive households and how this pandemic has caused a huge increase in abusive problems, but people just brush it off like no one is being affected by it.  I understand that Covid is very important virus, but like what Dr. Fauci said we know how to slow it down so others who are not that fortunate can escape the unintended consequences that shutting down the country has caused.  This and other reasons Dr. Fauci is against shutting down the country.\n\nHonestly ASU should've just opened the dorms for these types of students and that way they can mitigate both the covid and the household problems.",

It wasn't the biggest house but it was convenient and in a good neighborhood. apartment prices are skyrocketing for sure, but finding roommates to live in a house is a bit cheaper. I had a car tho about a five minute drive but close to a lightrail close to shuttles",

I can say that if I were in charge, perhaps I would reopen the dorms in a very limited capacity only for students like you, so you could return to on-campus housing without the sizeable risk of catching COVID that we're now seeing. But unfortunately, Crow's response during all this really has been a great injustice for everyone involved.",

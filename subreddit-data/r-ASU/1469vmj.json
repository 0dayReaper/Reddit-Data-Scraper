            "comment": "I haven't graduated yet but I might be a good person to answer this nevertheless. \n\nI graduated with honors (A.S. in CS) at my local community college before transferring to ASU. I learned the cornerstone to computer programming and overall enjoyed it, wanting it to be my dream at some point. I was going to transfer to ASU no questions asked to achieve my Bachelors in CS, however, not everything was a fairytale at that point. I was good at mathematics, but that wasn't the problem as I got an A in Calc II and Calc III, and all coding classes I got an A+ in easily. The problem was the moment I stepped into the doors of ASU my love for the subject crashed. Without turning into a rant I'll summarize it quick, but the CS department at ASU was an embarrassment compared to the professors I previously had. CSE360 was a group project course and the dropout rate was so high that it was all on you sometimes to do a 4 person size project. I had to withdraw from classes to spend time to actually learn the subject resulting in losing all grant money and in financial ruin. Everything was unorganized and If I could refund credit for the courses I earned I would because I honestly did not learn anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of frustration I withdrew from the CS program and transferred to Information Technology entirely. Overall I enjoy it already. It merges computer programming with computer systems and hardware and was a field I wish I joined previously. From a job standpoint it is much easier to start at entry-level IT rather than entry-level CS even though the pay is severely lower starting out. Several certifications can also be earned alongside schooling which also looks incredible on a resume, especially since in CS it's up to you to come up with projects to impress a recruiter.",

My worry was the math, and I also am really loving the IT courses, I just keep having tiny thoughts of \u201cshould I be doing CS and just grinding through it to start off with higher pay when I graduate?\u201d But I don\u2019t think I will love it as much as IT. And if the courses are not even helpful then I think I made the right decision, thank you again! Have you gotten any certs yet? I\u2019m working on Network + right now and then I\u2019ll do Security+",

We both have the same job title (software engineer) and make similar amounts, but his degree didn't have as many math classes as mine. If you don't love to program, I would definitely steer clear of the SW and CS degrees at ASU.",

            "comment": "I transferred to IT from another program (Computer Info systems) since I struggled with some courses. IT worked out well, partially due to already working while I was taking my courses. (Currently an SRE/SWE)\n\nI find CS and IT are pretty much parallel in terms of what fields you can land.. just might be different in terms of roles... pay you start with\n\nAt some point both degrees with experience become perpendicular and you can easily switch into roles you otherwise would have not landed had you started from either CS or the IT side. Specializing helps alot. \n\nI only regret not transferring sooner since i wouldn't have had to borrow money to pay for the extra courses during the summer but things worked out well for me so I take it as a learning lesson.",

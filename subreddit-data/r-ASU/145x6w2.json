Is it really that bad? Does it depend on your lab mates how you do? I haven't had problems with Phys 1 or Phys 2 labs too much really...",

You will have a lab partner and if I remember correctly they will be your partner for the semester, so your experience will probably heavily depended on this",

The three hour thing does kinda suck but if you finish your lab early, you can then leave.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm joining ASU (Tempe campus) for MS CS in August. I've been able to find a roommate, but we were looking for accommodation. It would be awesome if you could give me an idea of where ASU students usually stay. Also, how much per month does it cost to live in Tempe?  \nI'm an international student so I have zero insight on these nitty-gritties. Any help would be much appreciated!",

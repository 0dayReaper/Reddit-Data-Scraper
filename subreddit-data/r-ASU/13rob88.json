    "postText": "Hi all, \n\nAs many of you can imagine college cost estimation can have so many variables. It can be really tiring to figure out the \"average total cost\". For the folks (or parents of freshmen) going to ASU as a Freshman this year, could you please share your total cost. It is OK to share OOS as well as IS costs. \n\nReally appreciate the guidance on this since we have a finite budget and don't want to even apply for 2024 if the cost will be way outside of what we can afford.",

The grant covers \ud83d\udcaf tuition cost, you are responsible for your books and computer. That\u2019s it\u2026.",

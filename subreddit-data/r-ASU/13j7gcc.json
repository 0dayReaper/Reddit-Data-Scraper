    "postText": "This might be little long\n\nI just feel im wasting my dad's money. I'm an Indian student here at ASU and just paying the fees alone is a huge deal for my middle class family. \nMy father took out a 4000000 inr loan from the bank just to support my university education, even when he already had a 5000000 inr house loan. Then after a month or two he again had to take 1200000 inr and then 800000 inr just to pay off spring semester fees. I feel like a fucking worm, making my father pay that much emi(s) already. I just completed my first year this spring semester with 3.65(spring) and 3.27(cumm) gpa and I feel it's nothing what my father is spending on me. \n\nMy sister is going to start college in almost a yea (she just started 12th grade), and I don't know how my father is going to fund her and me at the same time.\n\nI feel like I should have stayed in India and studied like everybody else. I had an on-campus job once from which I got fired for no reasonable reason, and now my father is even paying for my grocery bills. I just wanna end it at this point, right now I'm in india and mum is asking me every now and then \"why don't you speak much often, like you use to do?\" I don't know how to explain that, I just sit there and ask myself wheather to keep going or just quit. \n\nThere are 3 years left and my father is already drowning in debt, he is planning to sell the house in which my mum and my sis lives in. I feel bad for my sister as well, she doesn't say a crap about this situation but i feel she is suffering too. I only spend money when it's really really necessary. when my father sends me money, i just cry for hours cause i feel like a fucking shit son. \n\nMy father work in a bank and he comes home late because he is working extra, and he always smile like he is not hurt, i wanna take inspiration from him, he is my role model but for him i think im a DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\nI just wrote a small part of what im feeling for past 7 months, im trying really hard but im almost at my brink. I just wanted to get this weight off my chest.\n\nEdit: 4000000 inr loan is a student loan (thats on me)",

He has considered the risk and has chosen that this is the absolute best investment he can make into solidifying a strong, positive future for you. I understand the guilt you feel. I felt the same when I was an undergrad. Now that I'm a parent, I completely understand the other side now, too. I understand the risk of taking out a loan in order to put my child through college. To me, it is worth absolutely every single penny. I wouldn't think twice about it. Trust your father has your well-being in mind and allow yourself a little slack.",

Also they don\u2019t open til January and close at the end of February or March, so note that this isn\u2019t a solution for right now and will have a tight window.

You study in US with a goal to get a good job\n\nOption 2. Stay in india \n\nWith option 1 - so far what i can understand is, you are doing fine in the college, but worried with all the loans your father is taking. So money is the problem...then do somethingh about it. Get a job, wait on tables work at grocery stores, waiting at table may pay you more ( many of the folks are doing this , connect with someone who is and go ahead with it. STUDY HARD AND WORK HARD, you have no time to waste. Maximise your earning to reduce your dads loans as much as possible. Remember - Your dad belives in you! you should also beleive in yourself. I am typing this with teary eyes beacuse I was in similar situation, my farm land was sold to support my education but in the end all is well now. Remember, every job in US is respected unlike India, so do whatver it takes to reduve your dads loan. Beleive me, parents can do anything for their kids and are happy doing it but do not dsiappoint them ! \n\nOption 2 . Stay in India if you can get a good job, but remember it will be hard as well. People will pass commnets at you and your family and you will be marked as a looser. now, this is also fine, if you have a plan to be succesfull and then everyone will forget. Remember, this also will be hard as untill you are sucesfull your parents/Dad will be unhappy. \n\nSo, you choose but remember to see the big picture and work towards making your parents proud. Please reduce negativity, be happy, talk to your mother - you are never gonna get this time back!!!",

The whole world felt like a lie. College felt like a scam. I pushed on. I held a 3.5 for my first and second semester.\n\nI struggle with ADHD, college was never going to be easy. My parents knew that. In my third semester I failed out. I was depressed. I didn't talk to anyone. I blew off my classes telling myself that they were easy and I could catch up whenever I wanted to. \n\nI should have gone home. I never should have stayed at my 4 year college as long as I did. I knew from the start that I didn't like it. My parents had insisted I go to a 4 year college when I would have rather gone to community college.\n\nMy whole life I had beaten myself and been beaten by others into submission. I never listened to myself and finally it had reached a breaking point. \n\nYou're under immense stress. Your education is very important. You are more important. Don't ignore yourself. \n\nThere is a saying. First God knocks. Then he pounds. Ignore him and he will kick down the door.\n\nWhen I broke not only did I fail out of school. I had been taking ADHD medication since age 7. My whole life I would up my meds each time my grades went down. In the process of failing out I had gotten onto the highest dose of 3 ADHD medications. When I failed out I went off all of them. I believed that they didn't work and I didn't know who I was. I had to become myself.\n\nI moved home and a week later my dad was diagnosed with cancer. My failure allowed me to spend every day of his last 6 months with him. \n\nIf you turn back you will find a saving grace. You will know how to continue with your life in a more informed manner. This is not a failure. You are not a failure.\n\nThe other people in this thread are looking at the numbers. You are more than numbers",

The selling of the house points to it being a bit shaky initially. However, it could be related to the fact that your sister will be starting college soon and maybe the guy wants to downsize a bit. Either way, he made the decision to guarantee the both of you your livelihoods during college, and there's nothing wrong with that. Maybe talk to him about it, and he might have his own reasoning that he just hasn't told you about yet.\n\nB) Take on some part time work (Ideally an on campus gig so you can do homework on the job!). I don't know the specifics around labor laws regarding international students, but the pay here is great for a student imo and if you can take on a 15-20 a week job, you can bring in enough to at least alleviate a good chunk of living expenses that your dad is paying. Keep in mind the pay difference between the two countries - Arizona has pretty good minimum wage and WILL make a meaningful amount of impact.\n\nC) Scholarships scholarships scholarships. Spend a weekend doing applications and see what happens. Can't speak for much here since I've got one granted to me for doing well on the ACT, but I know some cases of fellow students getting various scholarships that help heaps.\n\nNo pressure, but regardless, it's clear your father has major trust in you and is not just doing this out of blind love. You've got something that he sees as worth making concessions for. A good amount of kids have it so much better and still throw away all the sacrifice their parents put in. Keep trucking on, and I bet you'll feel great about it all eventually. Buy him something nice once you land a good job post-grad!",

I was in a similar situation as you, except I\u2019m not an international student (I am Indian but from California, so I can relate to the whole Indian parent thing). Still, my dad spent a pretty penny on my college education and I\u2019m still stuck with tens of thousands in federal loans. ASU isnt cheap, and classes get harder around sophomore year. If money is a really big issue at the moment tell your father how you really feel and explore your options. I did the same thing where I wouldnt call my parents, but in my case I also had a shitty gpa and switched my major twice. At least, you\u2019re doing better than me in terms of academics so keep that up. \n\nSecond, after talking to your parents if you decide to stay at ASU, get a part time job immediately. There are several on campus jobs, clean up nice and take your resume wherever you can. Having a job will help you cover a lot of your living costs (if you live in the dorms, get out immediately and live in an apartment near campus). My sophomore year, I found myself sharing a bedroom with 2 other people to split the rent (usually around $250 per person). No shame in that, gotta do what you gotta do. \n\nThird, apply for scholarships. You can find the portal online and grind out some applications over summer. A lot of them require essays so now is the perfect time to do so. Join a club in the fall, there are hundreds at ASU. Build something cool and apply for internships next year. If you\u2019re considering grad school, look into ASU\u2019s 4+1 program. You have to put yourself out there and make the best of what you have. \n\nAgain, and I cannot stress this enough, **TALK TO YOUR PARENTS**",

My best advice for you is to work as a server cause you make a little more due to tips compared to an hourly job and the schedule is more flexible. Also, you can get free or at least discounted food from the restaurant (varies tho) which can lessen your food/grocery costs. You can also try to apply and find internships during the summer time that you can work full-time or part-time during the school year, so you can at least eventually cover your own living expenses. Heck, I have a friend who couch surfs with friends just to save his parents dorm/apartment expenses. If you really want to lessen the guilt a bit, you have to put yourself to work.",

(according to United Nations sustainable development index)\n\nI am not sure on this and I am no finance expert, take this advice very carefully and do in-depth research on your own, but the only way out for you that I can think of is as follows: If you stay in India long-term and avoid going back to the USA, perhaps maybe even turn in your American citizenship or Visa, you can just not pay the loans like you never had them. This is a big risk if you plan on doing this. You want to make sure that you have nothing absolutely nothing left in the USA(documents, bank accounts/credit cards, assets, and even online things). Also, if you plan on doing this, you will never get the chance to come back to the USA. This will also allow you to borrow as much as you want or can and use it on your education, however that is risky, you won't have a lot of time. I did some Googling when writing this post, please please take it with a grain of salt and do your own research, I am not responsible for any consequences. Lastly, I am not sure on the legality of this debt strategy. Disclaimer, this is what came to mind when I saw those loans OP mentioned, I am walking a fine line by posting this; if this is too much, lmk, and I will take it down.\n\nWhile we are struggling to pay off our education, there is a kid somewhere in the USA who gets a monthly allowance of 5 Million dollars from his parents. I know somebody like that, he recently turned 18 and will be going/is going to ASU in order to party(among other things which I cannot even imagine)....he is dangerous\n\nanyways, here is the source I referenced: [https://www.opploans.com/oppu/articles/can-you-flee-your-debt-by-fleeing-the-country/](https://www.opploans.com/oppu/articles/can-you-flee-your-debt-by-fleeing-the-country/)\n\nhope this helps, be careful!",

If you can figure out your visa situation, I'd go home and face the reality of what's out there your options, and possibilities. Maybe that can motivate you. Take a break if you can but don't waste your father's money by failing classes you may be forced to pay to retake. But figure out your student visa situation and If getting an American degree is even worth it for you.",

Our culture puts a lot of shame and guilt on us sometimes, and majority of the time it\u2019s not even needed. You are passing, which is amazing. I\u2019m sure your parents know you are doing your best and they wouldn\u2019t fund your studies if they felt as if it wasn\u2019t \u201cworth it\u201d Yk. I\u2019m really sorry you feel like this. Maybe look around campus for another job to try to ease some of the stress. Also, talk to your advisor about any financial aid you can get and apply for tons of scholarships even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get them, the worst they will say is no. I hope this help, you aren\u2019t alone in feeling like this. I promise it will all be worth it in the end.",

The best you can do right now is give it your all and clear this cloud over your head. \n\nIt is important though that you realise practically if you got the potential to do well in the field you are studying..  I'm sure your parents back you a lot. So they are sure you have the potential. Just try and do the basics, I know things get real tough for many international students esp. in the first year but trust me, if you put in the effort you'd get pathways to get out of it. You can talk with counselling center too, to get a clear picture. \n\nThink about it, discuss and see if you're ready and wanting to put in the effort needed for next 3 Years. Don't rush into any decision. Hope it works out for ya..",

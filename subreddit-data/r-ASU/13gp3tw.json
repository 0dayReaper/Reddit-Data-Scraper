    "postText": "I recently graduated from WP Carey last week with a degree in Management (magna cum laude), and I am currently considering going back to school for an MBA. I already put down my information on the ASU website, and I am awaiting an email/callback.\n\nJust wanted to know the ins and outs of the program for anyone that had taken it. How long does it take? How much does it cost? What are some options for financial aid? How difficult is it? Anything of that sort will be super helpful!",

Find a job first, work, and then get an MBA. If you're still hellbent on grad school look for a specialized masters like the Business Analytics one.",

Most top tier MBA programs are used to pivot into high level roles at prestigious IB, VC, and Consulting firms so I'm not sure if you've done a cost benefit analysis, but total cost in-state is about 60k and out of state is 99K. \n\nThey do offer scholarships, but I think you need to inquire to get more information, and you can get the program done in 2 years.",

They won\u2019t get you a higher starting pay, but you can leverage what you learn and having a graduate degree to progress faster than you would with a bachelors degree alone.",

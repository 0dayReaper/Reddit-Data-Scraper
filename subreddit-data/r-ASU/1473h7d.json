I\u2019m majoring in Biological Sciences and am hoping to be a genetic counselor in the future. Any tips to getting involved in research, lab opportunities, internships etc? Or really any way to build up my resume besides course work and being a student worker?",

Basically it was wet lab in the Fall and genomic sequencing in the spring. We were supposed to have a symposium but got cancelled because of COVID. I took this a few years back so idk if they made any changes but def gives you a boost in undergrad research and I\u2019ve always used this experience for my interviews. Since you want to go into genetic counseling, maybe try looking into internships such as PCH",

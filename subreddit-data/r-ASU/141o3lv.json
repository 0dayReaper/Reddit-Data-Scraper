    "postText": "Is anyone taking BIO 498 that would prefer to take PLB 591? They're the same class and they're taught together, but I originally signed up as a non-degree seeking graduate and now I'm planning to get a post-bacc that BIO 498 would count for. Is anyone planning to drop BIO 498 or would be willing to switch to the graduate version?",

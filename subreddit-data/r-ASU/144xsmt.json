    "postText": "Is anyone taking CSE 230 for the Summer session on iCourse with Mar? We're on Project 3 relating with MIPS but hate how all the information and assignment is thrown at you all at once.   \n\n\nI would like clarification from a student first to understand what is going on in the project before asking the professor and TA. This would help me think further and ask for more questions. \n\nIf anyone can give me some tips or send a DM, that would be great, thanks!",

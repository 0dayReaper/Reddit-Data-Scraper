A couple of pro-tips that are helping me this week: \n\n1) get some accountability, tell a friend/parent/roommate what you have due this week and ask them to gently nag you about it when you're procrastinating.\n\n2) install the chrome extension Undestracted and use it to block Reddit/Twitter/Facebook during your work hours.",

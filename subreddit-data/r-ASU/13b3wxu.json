I just don\u2019t remember what she filled out. Talk to your advisor, they\u2019ll tell you what steps you need to take. The issue is that right now, all dorms are filled out at max capacity so it\u2019ll be very difficult to get something at the Tempe campus. When my sister requested the transfer it was given to her when there were available options.",

Hell I used to work downtown while living in Tempe and have 0 regrets about the experience at all. It might take more effort on your part to meet people with similar interests (joining clubs, on campus groups, etc) in Tempe versus you living right next to people with your similar major but I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth it.",

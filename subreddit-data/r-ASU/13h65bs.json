    "postText": "Greetings,\n\nI'm coming back to my BSEE studies after a multi-year hiatus. I began an attempt at this class in Fall 2019. I was already coming off of a bad time in Calc 3 and was definitely in over my head. I imagine I'll probably spend the summer brushing up on Calc, focusing on the latter end of Calc 2 and all of Calc 3. Any tips or resources I could review that helped you before/during the course? Visual aides would be awesome. \n\nThanks!",

Other than that grab the wheel and hold on for the other parts. Not trying to scare you but in my experience the reviews didn\u2019t help. However, depending on your professor you may have a better experience than me",

This class is undoubtedly going to be very challenging and perhaps the hardest undergrad EEE course. However, it\u2019s still very possible to not only pass, but do well. I think brushing up on calculus is a smart move as you will need a lot of it for the course. There\u2019s not too many other things to help besides stay with it and don\u2019t give up. It quickly becomes an avalanche when behind.",

            "comment": "Calc 3 vector math will be extremely foundational. So gradient, divergence, and curl are big building blocks. You also will learn/need to brush up on converting between coordinate types (cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical specifically). \n\nYou will be using all types of integrals, derivatives, and partial derivatives. So again, calc 3 is a big foundation for this class.\n\nReviewing quizzes and exams, I\u2019d say some basic physics 1, 2, and 3 stuff comes up. Make sure to keep up with units on your questions too cause at least Aberle liked to change them often.\n\nHigh praise for the symbolic toolbox (free thru asu) on Matlab, it can carry you through the course if you take time to understand it",

There are a variety of reasons that first year students fail and you need to figure out what your reasons are.\n\nDo you have an undiagnosed disability? Mental health issues? Do you need study strategies? Was there a language barrier? Were you battling culture shock? Did you not balance your time well? I could go on. The point is that you can't isolate and hope the solution just happens.\n\nCheck your scholarship and see if there is a probationary period or appeal option. You could also retake some classes in summer to try to improve your grades and progress. You can turn things around.",

Your experience is what you make of it, and for me seeing this, I totally get where you're coming from. Freshman year wasn't easy for me to accommodate to either, despite being in-state. I'm from a rural and diverse place, but here I've stumbled with finding my group.   \n\n\nEven if you fuck up, that's no excuse to \"not be here.\" I will say; in general this semester was **way** more difficult than previous ones, and total shit on top of that. If you ever feel like shit, just know you're not alone. I've had the worse time and it's my sophomore year. I can say as long as you work hard and manage your time wisely (especially with all the freedom in college), you'll be fine.   \n(*sorry if this advice was shit. i hope you're doing alright. it's almost the end of one year, and there's plenty space to make better ones down the road.*)",

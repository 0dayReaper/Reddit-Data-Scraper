What\u2019s it like? \n\nI heard \u201che\u2019s a terrible grader.\u201d I figured this class would be useful as a journalism student and I think he\u2019s the only instructor available. I\u2019m a decent photographer but not well-versed in the technical side of things. I would expect to be taught this at the first level. I just don\u2019t want to have to scrape by based on subjective grading.\n\nPlease help. \nThank you.",

            "comment": "Does Psych have a direct to PhD program? If they do I would do that instead of \"wasting time\" with a master's. Typically you'll get credits transferred into the PhD program from your master's but it depends on the program and the concentration of the degrees, so getting a master's in a different subject will affect how many credits are accepted. Getting an MS at ASU doesn't necessarily give you a better chance but it will allow you network with grad  faculty and see who would want to be your advisor which increases your chances of getting accepted.",

            "comment": "I am an undergrad, so take this with a grain of salt. Every grad student in Psych that I\u2019ve talked to (mostly developmental, social and clinical folks) have said do NOT get your masters if you plan to pursue a PhD. Typically, your PhD program will be funded through a fellowship (a partnership with your advisor/principle investigator in the lab you\u2019re applying for). Masters programs are VERY expensive. When you\u2019re in a PhD program, you will receive your Masters in Passing, meaning youll take the same classes, but they will be fully funded in a PhD program. The only perk to getting a masters (from what I\u2019ve been told) is that you might have an increased chance of admission to a PhD program if you have a masters degree (from any school). All of this definitely depends on the program you\u2019re applying for, but this is generally what I\u2019ve been told by grad students in Psych and PIs in various labs.",

                    "comment": "my professor who now is recommending me to apply for both masters and phd programs also told me initially not to do a masters if i know i want to do a phd. the issue is that i did my undergrad from 2020-2022 and all the research opportunities was closed at my school. even now, things are finally slowly reopening but i\u2019m moving away from my state in a couple days because i can\u2019t afford to live here and i was homeless several times during my undergrad. i\u2019m moving closer to asu and i was going to try to email professors there about if they had openings for their labs (not sure how this works since i\u2019m not an alumni) and then my professor said if i\u2019m struggling to research exp, i could go for my masters and also just try to apply for a phd without the exp. the research experience is what\u2019s killing me. the only thing i have is an internship for the department of public social services and a lab course i took as an elective. i guess technically when i was a bio major my first semester, i did a couple presentations but that doesn\u2019t even count lol. now i\u2019m working for the state as a behavioral tech. \n\nif i\u2019m emailing professors for room in their lab, is that the same as what some people do to reach out to faculty to see if they\u2019ll be a prospective PI or something like that for grad school? also how should i email to volunteer in labs without research experience and as a graduate now?",

If you're concerned that you might not get into, then apply for a backup masters or two but just know you could end up \"losing\" credit from your masters or just completely redo all of it once you get into a phd program. Obviously this varies a lot, so do your research and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into.",

            "comment": "What kind of PhD? (Clinical, cognitive, development, etc) in most doctoral programs, you will have to re-do your masters if you come in already with one, although in some programs you get some course credit for your masters - although you would still be there for 5ish years. I can only really speak for clinical I do not think getting a masters at ASU will help you get into their specific PhD program. When I was in undergrad, I knew someone who went straight from undergrad to the developmental psych PhD program, but I heard that it is rare for the program to accept people who did their undergrad at ASU, that may apply to the masters program as well. It would probably be more advantageous for you to get a masters somewhere else, although I\u2019d say getting research experience is more important.",

Depending what you want yk do for a career, the EdS degree, may be the better option too. It is between a Masters &amp; PhD without the research component.",

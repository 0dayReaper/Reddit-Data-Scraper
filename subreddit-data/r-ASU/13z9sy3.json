Both times they told me that if I could complete a certain set of classes in the major then I'd be let into the respective programs. \n\nI ended up going the cs route and after completing a few classes (discrete math, computer organization, etc.) they let me into that program. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions.",

Look on your major map for the critical course requirements and when you're supposed to be completing them per semester. That's what you're not hitting. Changing your major is only potentially required after you've been off track twice.",

            "comment": "You'll need your advisor to look at your specific situation. Does the hold say you are off-track twice avd need to change majors? Or does it just say you are off track and need to meet with your advisor? Assuming you mean CS with WPC, you must be off-track twice for the same reason, not two separate reasons. The computer system can sometimes pickup on something by mistake too. Only your advisor can tell you if that's what happened for you. \n\nIf you are truly off-track twice, it's good you are taking it this Summer. Your advisor might be able to note your account to help prevent the change. The forced changes start in late July though, not after Session B like the other poster said. If you did get moved out and then finished the class successfully just a few weeks later, your advisor can help you get switched back in. \n\nIf the class in question is a Math class, you could petition for permission to have another semester for completion. You can do that for any requirement, but they are most understanding when it's a Math class. \n\nIf it's not a Math class, ask your advisor about changing to the 2023 Major Map. Starting with Fall 2023, WPC will no longer be forcing major changes for any off-track issues besides English and Math (in line with ASU rules). So, that could take care of the issue for you.",

            "comment": "Depending on what you are off track for, you might be able to ask your advisor to stay in the program. When it comes to being off track, your advisor holds an ENORMOUS amount of power.  With a 3.8 GPA, you may have a good argument for asking to stay in the program if you want to.\nIf you really want to stay in the program, I would suggest trying to meet with your advisor ASAP. Also, you are not removed from your program until the end of summer B session.  If the classes you are missing are offered as a summer classes, you could try to get into the class and fix your off-track status.",

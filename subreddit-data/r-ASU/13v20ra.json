    "postText": "My wife and I were recently married and are still planning on attending ASU for a while (grad school and such). Not for this next academic year (2023-2024), but the year after (2024-2025), is there a good apartment complex that costs in the area of $1,000 or less (I know this is dream rent) somewhat near ASU or along the Streetcar (which I will call the Caterpillar)? A studio that could reasonably fit two is a perfect option, honestly. I am wanting to get ahead of the curve as much as I can to secure an apartment. Starting earlier is better :)\n\nAny suggestions are welcome. There's just so much to look through and pricing online is not always... honest.",

For the equivalent cost to the Tempe slums you can at least get something that's nicer with amenities. Most buildings in the metro are owned by corporations now so everywhere has its quirks. When we were looking we found the Tempe rentals to be the same cost as mid/downtown Phoenix but much less well equipped.",

I liked it when I lived there and since they have multiple apartments across a single street, you have multiple options on if you want to be closer to campus or a bit father away to save on money or time. Sadly the $1000 rent is a dream, but studios and one bedrooms go for $1200-$1300, typically all you have to pay besides rent is electricity which runs anywhere from $50-$150 depending on the temperature. Or I would look at University Valley as well. If you have any questions about the reviews, I can always help or recommend other places",

You get 2-4 hrs of sleep max and don't retain as much info that you studied for. It was to the point where I had to withdraw at least one class and quit one of my jobs in the middle of the semester.   \n\n\nPlease don't overwork yourself. You would be better off focusing on one thing and doing well at it over doing multiple things but lack focus",

When you are that busy, you don't actually have time to learn the content and just survive by regurgitating it. \n\n2. It is more work than you think it is. \n\n3. Online A and B session courses are the WORST, I'd strongly recommend finding a C session that fills the same requirements for one of them, and then dropping the other for this semester. \n\n4. If you want to be a TA, you want to enjoy it, have time to teach people the content and connect with students. You can't do that if you are so busy you can't breathe. \n\n\nOverall, I have shit mental health for choosing to do what you are doing and even though I'm sure you have it in you, I encourage you to change what you can.",

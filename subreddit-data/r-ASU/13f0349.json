First, make sure you're looking at Tempe crime rates and not Phoenix crime rates, which isn't always easy because Tempe is as forthcoming about crime. Also know that just because a city has a higher crime rate, that doesn't mean there's more crime everywhere in that city. Most crime is committed in a few hot spots of crime. \n\nNow, college campuses (pretty much all of them, but especially in urban areas) are hot spots for property crime because there's a lot of opportunity to steal stuff from college students. College areas tend to also have more fights that break out in the areas with a lot of bars. Staying out of fights is pretty easy, usually, not getting your shit stolen can take a bit more work. \n\nIf you're coming from a smaller city/town/whatever then you might need to make more serious effort of situational awareness and keeping yourself safe, but that doesn't mean Tempe is unsafe.",

Here is some advice that helped me:\n\nI would say just use common sense. Don't go out to a ghetto area when you don't need to, especially if you're alone. If needed, stick with a close group of friends, and try to stay sober when going out. I personally never drink unless I know for a fact I'm never gonna leave my house/friends house because I don't want to be even slightly intoxicated while something goes down if we're going out\n\nAlso, stay strapped. Buy a gun and learn how to use it. If you can't do that, carry a knife. Go to the gym to get stronger, and maybe learn some self defense techniques. You never know when it might come in handy, and it can save your life.",

    "postText": "So this post is basically for the stem majors and what to expect when you land your first job. \n\nAs stated I graduated with a math degree. Now I was told that math was super important for engineering, however, since I started working I have not used any math whatsoever. A bit surprised by this but I'm not really complaining about that.\n\nA big difference between school and work that I noticed is the type of problems you need to solve. In school, when you are given an assignment, there are very clear guidelines for how to get the problem done. There is also an end goal. You know what you are working toward. At work this is not the case. If I am given a problem at work, my boss will give me maybe 5% of the information and tools I need to get it done.\nThis is where I had to become an engineer and ask questions, try things out, fail and break stuff, then try again until I iterate to a correct (or reasonable) answer.\n\nAlso, school and work are formated COMPLETELY different from each other. In school, I was given material to study, then  I was given an exam on the material and my grade was based off how I did. At work I was basically thrown into the fire first, then learned as I went along. This was the biggest eye opener for me because I had to be diligent and precise on topics I had never seen before because the systems I work on are large and expensive. \n\nLast thing: software. In school, again, assignments are well defined and strict guide rails are put up for relatively small projects in a coding class. Because of this, u don't really need to learn to much to get a project done. HOWEVER, at work, software projects are GIANT and if I was asked to make a change to projects, it was impossible to really know how the change fit into the project as a whole. Because the repos are so large, it would take me 6 months to a year to get through every file and understand how the software, tools, and equipment and entangled together.\n\nI know this was long but if you made it to the end know this:\nWhen you get your first job:\n*Don't be scared if you are intimidated by the scale of the project you are working on\n\n*Don't be scared if after the first 6 months to a year you still feel like you are lost\n\n*Don't worry to much about the material you learned in school, focus more on basic computer knowledge and troubleshooting skills\n\n*Ask questions and show you are willing to learn. Take notes of what people tell you so you are not asking the same question over and over.\n\n*Make mistakes! Even after all the things I typed ( while I'm at work, supposed to be working), your boss will understand you are new. They expect you to break things at first.",

Your post is spot on.\n\nNothing ever goes 100% smooth. You'll always be making mistakes. \n\nFor what I do math can be important as we work in a lot of 3d coordinate systems but talking with the engineers at my work, they rarely use calculus. Which was made my struggles with calculus all that much more enjoyable.",

I did have the advantage of 2 internships where my boss was like \"Nobody knows how to do this, go figure it out\". \n\nI was hired directly out of college as a Business Intelligence Analyst with an insurance company (that you've never heard of). Anyways, I knew nothing about insurance. You're 6 month period is really accurate. I felt like I was finally starting to contribute after month 4-5. \n\n&gt;*Ask questions and show you are willing to learn. Take notes of what people tell you so you are not asking the same question over and over.\n\nBig emphasis on this. The thing is that where you are going to work most likely has a SME (subject matter expert) that you can lean on to learn so many things. Treat this person like an angel and it really says a lot about your desire to learn and contribute. Just don't drown them with questions :D",

A bachelor's degree should be helping you build those skills for learning. Every bullet point is true for learning in your degree:\n\n\n*Don't be scared if after the first 6 months to a year you still feel like you are lost\n\nAbsolutely true for first-year students at ASU. So many are afraid that they don't belong when they are still lost. \n\n*Don't worry to much about the material you learned in school, focus more on basic computer knowledge and troubleshooting skills\n\nWhile more specific to your field, focusing on being really good at basic writing, math, and critical thinking during college is important. \n\n*Ask questions and show you are willing to learn. Take notes of what people tell you so you are not asking the same question over and over.\n\nWhy don't people take notes anymore? Some people take them on the computer, but getting in the practice of taking notes and organizing them will help you in the real world. Asking questions is also important and people tend to think they will look bad if they ask. You look engaged and interested when you ask questions. \n\n*Make mistakes! Even after all the things I typed ( while I'm at work, supposed to be working), your boss will understand you are new. They expect you to break things at first.\n\nSuch good advice. We learn best by making mistakes and struggling a bit. It is good for us.\n\nSorry to get on my soapbox, but I think it can be hard to see why some things in college actually do help in your career.",

It's more of the ability to stay consistent with something, reaching out for help, keeping your work organized, learning how to solve problems in general (not specific material). The mental gymnastics I did as a math undergraduate allowed me to think abstractly and understand conceptually difficult subjects. I took that into work and tailored that thinking into the things I need to know at work.",

So if roommates do agree to switch, it's probably a good idea to email housing and ask if it's possible to note it officially on the contract/assignment. You never know what might happen during the year and whether the other roommate will always be as accommodating, honest, or protective as they agree to be at the beginning of the year.",

In this image of a shared room/shared bath at BRC (Barrett Residential Complex), there are two room numbers, each with their own entry door off of the hallway. Inside each room the beds are A1 and A2.\n\nI am a parent with a student in Cereus this year. LMK if you have other questions.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! So I have a couple of questions since my path is looking like I will graduate December of 2024. I know I\u2019m early, but I like to start planning ahead lol\n\n1. When it\u2019s graduation season for December graduates, are the class numbers still set up for us to take pictures with? \n2. I know for Spring graduates, they have all the different type of ceremonies, will those same ceremonies be available in December as well? (I tried asking my advisor about this, but they were unsure) \n\nThank you for all your help!",

If you really want a picture in front of it, might be worth doing now. If it's not at ASU for Fall Graduation, you might be able to find it on Mill around new years. Usually it's around next years.\n\n2. Yes. It's possible that some of the ceremonies that were split up in the Spring might be merged in the Fall (Like CLAS). Also, possible others might be split up, if they're projected to be too large. More departmental events might or might not, you'd have to check with them independently. But the big ones on that show up here will: https://graduation.asu.edu/ceremonies\n\nAlso, there's a good chance the graduate commence ceremony will be split in the fall into two, one for Masters and and one PhD candidates.\n\nPersonally, I'd prefer the Fall ceremonies, it's a bit cooler, and they tend to be smaller.\n\nAlso, it's a bit early but congratulations!",

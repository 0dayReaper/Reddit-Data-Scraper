If you\u2019re talking about in regards to littering, they would have to get approval from ASU directly in that case, and probably be forced to take down all posters that aren\u2019t posted by ASU. \n\nWhy are you so defensive about this? All I\u2019m saying is the police are not the ones who are able to do this. Even if they got permission, they would need to place a good team of 4-5 officers to just stroll around campus ripping down posters. They would rather put those officers in better places, not to mention it would stir up a very odd sight to see government workers ripping down posters everywhere",

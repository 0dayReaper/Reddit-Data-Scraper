    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m currently a philosophy major at the moment with a focus of going to law school. I feel as though I may not have made the best decision by majoring in philosophy and would like some advice. \n\nMy goal is to become a lawyer, and as of this moment, I\u2019m passionate about it. No, I\u2019m not doing it for the money. Its a genuine passion of mine and it could honestly pay less than $50k a year and I would still want to be a lawyer or go to law school. \n\nThe reason why I chose philosophy as my major is because I heard they performed best on the LSAT, and that it doesn\u2019t matter what my bachelor degree is anyways as long as I have a good GPA. However, I\u2019m afraid that when the time comes to it, and I don\u2019t feel like being a lawyer anymore (which is very unlikely but it\u2019s something I want to account for), I will not be able to get a job with a philosophy degree. \n\nWith a political science degree, I will have more leeway and can fall back to it if by then I don\u2019t feel like going to law school. I\u2019m currently a sophomore and I\u2019m taking intro courses to philosophy at the moment. I recently switched my major to philosophy. I\u2019ve had multiple appointments with my advisor, and with the way things are looking right now, I can graduate at the end of my junior year. I\u2019m currently taking PHI 103 and 105 right now. \n\nAnyways, sorry that was kind of all unnecessary. But bottom line, should I take philosophy or political science? I actually kind of like philosophy and find it enjoyable, but I\u2019m not sure if this is the best route for me.",

That includes the bedroom, bathroom and closet. Your bedroom might include those weird shelves built into the wall. Also, I tried sticking things to the walls when I lived there but everything fell off lmao, if you want to hang anything to the wall you\u2019re going to have to nail it in.\n\nAlso I\u2019d highly recommend avoiding vertex but if you\u2019re already locked in, make the best of it.",

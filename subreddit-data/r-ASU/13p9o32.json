    "postText": "The title basically. I'm interviewing at a company based out of California. Haven't got the offer yet, but I wanted to know if I can even intern in the Fall semester, since this will be an in-person internship. I know that I need to be enrolled as a full-time student due to F1 visa. If anyone has been through a similar situation, please let me know. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Yes you can do internships. Contact the ISSC office once you have the offer letter, tell them this is scheduled for the fall semester. They will have to process your CPT for you to be able to work off campus while youre still enrolled in school. Please do this ahead of your start date if you get hired. CPT takes 10 or so business days to get processed.\n\nI also believe you have to enroll for one particular class (work-study something, can't remember). This class is not graded but basically used to show you're doing an internship as a student. ISSC will tell you more.",

However, in doing an internship that is out of state, I would be worried that you won\u2019t be enrolled in enough in-person credits to satisfy the requirements of your visa. You really need to talk to the ISSC about this and not rely on Reddit.",

This has totaled up to $15000. Will Starbucks pay only for $5250 of the amount of this, will they pay full? Do I have to pay the remaining? Please. help. I\u2019ve talked to so many people, all the asu financial aid counselors, advisors, my coach, coworkers, etc. and it\u2019s still confusing\u2026",

            "comment": "Hi there! Congrats on starting your ASU journey! After your fafsa is applied + SCAP scholarship (42% upfront) Starbucks will also add their  \"Starbucks tuition benefit\" to cover the remainder if both fafwa and the 42% won't cover it. If you go over 5,250 of the \"Starbucks tuition benefit\" you will be taxed for what is used beyond $5250. \n\nTl;Dr: your tuition be covered with the help of fafsa, Starbucks scholarship, and Starbucks tuition benefit. If you go over you benefit (unlikely) you will be taxed as anything beyond 5250 would be considered taxable income. \n\n\nIf it doesn't make sense I can try explaining it again. Feel free to ask more questions.",

It will always be jan 6 and july 6 and the hours the week prior the deadline date will count towards it.

            "comment": "The way it works is: \nYou work with Starbucks and get a 42% scholarship (so for every $1,000.00 they pay $420, leaving you $580. The $580 is covered by the $5,250.00 tax limit.) FASFA can also help with CAP scholarships, which is added money to help your college career. I get an extra grand a semester, which adds $3000 in support. \n\nSo\u2014-all in all, watch the tax limit of the post SCAP limit. The partner faq page explains the taxable amount well (if you go over $5250, you\u2019re then taxed at your income bracket-)",

            "comment": "Wanna add, bc I didn\u2019t know and it would have been helpful, SCAP renews in January. Unlike how the school year typically begins in August, the scholarship  renews in January while enrolled. Small detail that made a difference when enrolling in courses. \n\nAlso, aim to work 20 hours weekly. It\u2019s okay to work 18-19 here and there, but then you\u2019d want to work over 20 to make sure you meet the audit requirement.",

Some people are ballsy and go for the entire trifecta as the course outline will try to state, it\u2019s a rough semester. You splitting it up like you did is the way to do it and also keep your sanity. 355 is content heavy and not doing it at the same time as you are taking the project heavy 340 is a good call. The rest of the classes you have are pretty much just jumping through hoops. Just keep in mind the trifecta is what will weed out many students from the program, so you gotta just push through those and the rest is much more interesting.",

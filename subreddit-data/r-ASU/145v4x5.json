    "postText": "If I am going for masters in cs on F1 Visa, can I use the remaining visa period post completion of masters for pursuing PhD. What will be the steps(if any) for the same.\nIf same f1 visa is valid for PhD, since PhD may require more time than what remains on F1 Visa duration(3 years), will I need to renew F1 Visa again in this case or are there any other steps for continuing PhD.\nAfter PhD, If I require to do post doc, will the F1 Visa be utilised or opt (1 year + 2 year stem extension) or I will have to apply for some other visa.Please explain steps for this case as well.\nI understand it's a long question. Thanks for answering.",

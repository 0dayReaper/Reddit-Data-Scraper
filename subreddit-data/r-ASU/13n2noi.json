    "postText": "Moving into Villas at Vista next semester, but I need to do a study abroad program at some point for my certificate. Obviously if I leave I'll have to give up my spot. I'm honestly considering just paying for my apartment while im gone and letting it just be an empty space. I'm an out of state student so losing this apartment isn't an option for me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any workarounds I can do to keep my spot while I'm gone? Can I let a friend stay in my room for the semester I'm gone and then just switch back when I return? Kinda a weird situation but also serious.",

The damage people can do to a room knowing they will never pay a dime for that is... significant. I don't believe ASU allows the rooms to be used for commercial purpose, so you have to be very cautious. Ask friends if they have friends in need of a room.",

You can actually get called before the conduct board for doing so with all sorts of consequences, including removal from both Housing and even ASU. \n\nIf you do Study Abroad in Spring, you can just request to cancel your Housing for Spring semester. You can't stay there for Summer anyway unless you are taking Summer classes. \n\nIf you go in Fall, really your only option is to pay with the room empty. However, you still have to check-in for Fall. If you don't check-in within 2-weeks, they cancel your housing contract even if you have paid.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m coming up on my junior year and wanting to switch to the on-campus program. As a veteran pushing 30, what are some of y\u2019all\u2019s experiences? \n\nI would be at the Polytechnic campus and it\u2019s only about 20 min from home. I\u2019d also be able to maximize my GI bill. \n\nFeeling \u2018outta place\u2019 and class flexibility are two of my worries though. \n\nAny insight is appreciated!",

However, i think if something can be online right now, it probably should be.  Unfortunately, choosing in person classes not only places the individuals who WANT to go in-person at risk, but it places the professors that now NEED to go in-person at risk as well. Some of these professors are completely okay with it, others are not.  Pretty sure my prob &amp; stats professor takes care of her elderly parents so it can be kind of... I don\u2019t know... not so great when a student puts their desire for in-person first.  And it\u2019s not only the professors, several other staff members have to go back now as well because, say, a student would rather an in-person advising appointment rather than a phone call.  \n\nIf it only affected the individual making the decision, I\u2019d be much more comfortable and inclined to say Asu should remain open.  But because the students\u2019 decisions also effect our professors, staff members, and the community/state around us I must respectfully stand by my hope that the school will go back to using zoom.  \n\nThis is not to say I like zoom, just trying to look at the larger picture.  Thank you for sharing your opinion though, and respectfully as well.  I think this sort of healthy debate is a really good thing right now\n\nEdit: allegedly (can not confirm) Asu is also telling professors and staff members to keep positive test cases quiet.  If someone in an in-person class tests positive, the rest of the class will likely not be alerted if this is the case which could cause another spike.  This just makes things all the more risky... IF it\u2019s true",

I do agree with you in that it is not entirely up to the individual as a choice and that staff is required, but what I have seen ASU has been great in that they have options for all types of students. Think of a out-of-state student that needs to have an advising session, they have the resources to do so. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there are students that prefer in person attention and staff that are available.\n\nAnd absolutely, I don't think people yelling and saying \"Crow bad\" and things in that nature are very constructive. Yes, everyone hates this and want things to change on all sides, which is why we need to weigh all options. I, personally, just think returning to somewhat normal life like we are now is the best decision. Giving those to go online or go in-person is the best, closing entirely is not",

This is not how envisioned my senior year and far from how I wanted to go down by being at home, but I\u2019m doing my part in trying not to affect others and continuing the spread.\n\nPlus, you choosing to go to campus and possibly not getting your money\u2019s worth is your own doing. Most of us knew we weren\u2019t going to be getting the normal college experience this fall, which is why a lot of us didn\u2019t return to campus, not mainly because of the virus, but because we knew converting completely back online was a high possibility and hundreds to thousands would go to waste. You were just too ignorant and naive to not see that.",

This virus will continue to affect how we live permanently and will not be fixed in a semester time. Some people have chosen to stay home and go online which makes sense and I totally support that, and thank you for doing your part, but I am just confused why students who are attending are now saying they should shut down campus. I applaud ASU and the faculty who are really making the best of this situation.\n\nCurrently I am getting what I paid for I am taking in-person classes and staying on campus, granted two of my classes that are over 50 students is entirely online but that makes sense and I prefer it that way. So yes I am getting what I paid for. I just don't understand why people who are in my position are begging for ASU to shut down",

I know people are saying they come from toxic environments at home and can\u2019t focus unless they\u2019re away and at school. I\u2019ll give them a pass. \n\nHowever, the majority of incoming students are just looking to get away and be care free and partying in the middle of a pandemic like a bunch of dumb fucks. I put the blame on them too, cause they could be doing more to avoid further spreading the virus, but choose not to because they\u2019re selfish, and hurting those who want to actually come back but don\u2019t want to be put at risk. \n\nBut we can\u2019t ignore the greediness with ASU hiding their number of cases, and not to mention they seem to be scheming things up to put blame on the students so they can\u2019t be held liable if cases go up or can\u2019t refund any money. \n\nThat\u2019s why both on and off campus students are asking to shut down, because the longer this type of irresponsibility continues, the longer we can\u2019t get back to normal. I thought by the time spring rolled around I would be able to come back and finish things up and enjoy my last few months as a college student, but with the way it\u2019s looking I\u2019m starting to question if its worth going back if we\u2019re still going to have tight restrictions to everything.",

NAU started all of its classes online to let students get settled in before opening to in-person. U of A has some similar issues in campus life, but it appears that teachers had a lot more flexibility than teachers got at ASU. Let's not forget that U of A's response around contact tracing and wastewater testing got a lot of good press.\n\nASU took a much more aggressive approach to opening the campus than the other two schools. That order might have come from the Board of Regents, but the hard-charge forward matches Crow's behavior at his previous jobs.",

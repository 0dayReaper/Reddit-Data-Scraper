    "postText": "Hello, I received the new american scholarship upon admission to ASU. I had a few classes that i had credit for because i previously took AP. However, i still chose to take these classes again during my freshman year due to time conflicts. I was not informed by my advisor that these credits would not count towards my gpa and scholarship. Therefore, i lost a part of my scholarship at the end of the semester due to me not earning 15 credits. What can i do in this case? Is she at fault for not informing a freshman that they might loose their scholarship? Any help is appreciated.",

While advisors may know some information about scholarships and other aid, it's on you to find out the full details about them. Contact the financial aid office and see what you're able to do, you may be able to appeal your case but you're more likely to get the full amount back if you take the credits over the summer.",

            "comment": "You are an adult now. If you chose to take classes you knew you didn't need after transferring them in, that is not on your advisor. Even if you actually asked the specific question, which I'm assuming you did not, your Academic Advisor is there to advise on Academics, not on financial aid. Any aid questions should go to the FA office. The only time something an academic advisor told you might make a difference is if they said something like a class would count for graduation and then it did not. \n\nIt is also 30 credits per year if you mean the NAmU scholarship, not 15 per semester. The only way one semester should have affected your award is if: \n\n1) it was Spring and the two semesters combined were under 30 credits, in which case you could take Summer classes, but Summer classes are expensive so not really worth it if you are still getting the 80% amount in Fall. \n\n2) You ended up with less than 12 credits by ASU standards for the semester. Then you were not considered full-time, which would have lowered your aid allowance. \n\nAs a last thought, did this involve an Obama scholarship. If do, check in with FA. There was an error that deleted the Spring Obama amounts from many students accounts and charged them back. Supposedly it is being fixed now.",

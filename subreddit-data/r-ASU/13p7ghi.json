    "postText": "Just curious as to what the process is or what happens. I've had A LOT go on these past 6 months since the last audit, in addition to not being scheduled enough hours mixed with needing to take time off a decent amount, there's nearly no way I will make the 520 hours for the June/July Audit.\n\nHas anyone else ever had this happen while attending ASU? Will they allow you to pick things back up for the semester following the Dec/Jan audit? Or do you have to re-enroll?",

If you need to skip the fall semester you might want to reach out to your advisor to ensure there's nothing on ASU's side to do. Otherwise, once you are eligible again for SCAP (next audit) then Sbux automatically informs ASU and it's all handled behind the scenes.\n\nAlso, any sick time and LOA hours count towards eligibility. Double check your BEN hours if you haven't already!",

    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nMy brother will be an incoming Freshman in the fall and I am looking for good high school graduation gift ideas for him.\n\nHe likes the outdoors, things like mountain biking, hiking, etc. as well as golf and cars. My parents will take care of dorm things so getting anything like that isn't necessary (Target gift cards, etc). He will have my scooter and electric skateboard from my past few years in college to get around campus, so he doesn't need those.\n\nI thought about getting him a mountain bike, as he currently uses our dad's when he rides the trails near our house, but obviously can't take that with him. I'm not sure if there's trails close enough to get to if he won't have a car on campus?\n\nFrom what I've read on this subreddit there's not really a place to store them and bikes left outside tend to get stolen, so I think I might avoid this idea. I wouldn't want to spend the money to get him that to have something like that happen.\n\nI just graduated last year so I have my own experience to draw from but I guess I'm asking if there's anything ASU specific that might be good to get him that someone not from the area might not think of.\n\nBudget isn't really a concern (outside of paying for his tuition). If anyone has recommendations I'd love to hear them! Thanks!",

            "comment": "Unless he has a place to store the bike indoors it will likely get stolen outside, especially a nice mountain bike. There are some trails close to campus at Papago Park just a short ride away. They're more like beginner to lower intermediate level but still a lot of fun. The next closest would be South Mountain Park which is one of the best trail systems in the Phoenix area. They have trails from beginner to expert trails. Many top riders come to ride National Trail at South Mountain and attempt to the infamous waterfall feature. Phoenix is the best city for year round mtb, but summer riding should be avoided if you're not properly acclimated for it. \n\nYou could possibly hook him up with a mountain biking experience where you're taken out to some trails by a company and given a bike to ride for the day. Sedona, AZ is also home to a very popular MTB festival so you can possibly get him tickets to that or also set up an mtb trip there as well.\n\nAlso, tell him to check out the ASU Outdoors Club, they do trips throughout the year for climbing, hiking, mountain biking, etc.",

([https://azstateparks.com/passes-and-gift-cards](https://azstateparks.com/passes-and-gift-cards))  That way if he makes friends that have cars he can provide the entrance to the parks in exchange for a ride.",

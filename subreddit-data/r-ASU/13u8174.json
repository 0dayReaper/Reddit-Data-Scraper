C\u2019s do get degrees, and ASU is the best place to just get it over w and fuck around. basically, you\u2019ll get whatever you put in. \n\nalso join clubs that aren\u2019t business related.",

It will benefit you in the long run. \n\nAdvice for year 1, just take electives on interesting stuff. Take religion or construction or anthropology; whatever. Have fun enjoy the adventure.\n\nEnd of year 2 is business class time. It will be boring but just do it. Do the toughest.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what the hardest are ; they are accounting or finance.",

Basically you earn X dollars but you have tons of lines of expenses, so how do you owe in taxes. Obviously gets more complicated than that, but a silly illustration to understand it.\n\nFinance definitely gets more complex in math than that, but not heavy calculus or anything like that. You\u2019d want to have algebra down like the back of your hand and a strong understanding of the fundamentals of statistics. After that it\u2019s not much more heavy in quant, but heavier on decision making using Algebra and statistics. Also, heavy on spreadsheets. Like of model building using excel formula and references. \n\nI did finance and it was hard but not impossible. But I do enjoy math and working in spreadsheets. I don\u2019t work in finance today but was a great background to have. I actually started it engineering at ASU but hated design , so moved to finance to maintain quant and find it just challenging enough.\n\nHope that helps and happy to answer any other questions.\n\nOne other major to consider with high difficulty I didn\u2019t touch on originally would be economics. I actually think it\u2019s the toughest but it can get into some basic calculus in the upper division classes.\n\nAll are good for introverts. I\u2019m an introvert and any are good for that. Marketing and management prefers the extrovert .",

Also if you do, usually your professor will do a quick refresher on how to use them , so you won\u2019t get blindsided by it.\n\nAs for fields of work, the reason I said choose the hardest is that employers will like that you can tough through hard stuff. They won\u2019t actually care about the subject matter. You\u2019ll learn it on the job. I work in data analysis and don\u2019t use any actual learnings but because I did finance they know you can figure out the rest. I\u2019d say I use spreadsheets the most.\n\nAs for if you actually went into the fields directly\u2026 I did start off as a financial analyst. Heavy overlap with accounting. I\u2019d say decent pay and I was never really stressed. Never worked more than 40 hours a week. Fairly interesting problems to deal with. It\u2019s not a bad life honestly. My biggest issue is just that it could get a little boring, which is why I switched to data. But with these degrees you\u2019ll be able to do the jump if you choose to do so.\n\nI also got an mba 2 years ago. Not from asu but finance was a good foundation for it. Others struggled with finance that came from other backgrounds during the mba",

You\u2019ll probably face difficulties getting paid internships but local businesses or startups would definitely provide you unpaid stuff.\n\nIf you\u2019re not in a financial position to do unpaid stuff that is OK. And if you feel like you need adjustment time before just piling on all the extra commitments, that\u2019s OK too. Sophomore year is when you really need to start digging in and bolstering your resume, anyways\n\nJust chat with your WPC career advisor for more info and resources - don\u2019t know if they\u2019re better nowadays, but they\u2019re typically good at helping students go in the right direction at least",

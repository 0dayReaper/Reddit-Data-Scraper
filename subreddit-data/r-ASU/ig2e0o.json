I started my last semester at 3.94 accumulated, having earned a few Bs and B+s over the years, and ended with exactly 4.00 earning three A+ and one A for the final semester's grades.  I lucked out of having to take more than four classes for the last semester so it was less of a load than yours... \n\nDefinitely keep up the hard work. Even if you just get the sad online \"ceremony\", you still have that point of pride. Good luck, mate.",

As public law schools go, it\u2019s a very good school. \n\nThere are merit scholarships and programs available, though I am not familiar with them myself. You would need to look into that by contact ASU Law directly. I had a student get a full ride a few years ago that was based on merit. \n\nASU Law is fantastic if you want to work in Arizona and there is a strong pipeline to California and at a lesser extent to some other states. When you select a law school, unless you are going to an Ivy League, you should be selecting a school where you will make connections for the place you want to live, while also accounting for the financial aspect. \n\nThere is an entire pre-law site that you can find more info about law school in general (not just ASU Law). So be sure to check hat out [here](https://prelaw.asu.edu).",

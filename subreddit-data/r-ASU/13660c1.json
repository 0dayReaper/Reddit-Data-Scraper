    "postText": "Hi guys. I'm a first generation immigrant. I was wondering if I'm considered a first generation student. My parents went to college in our country. It's a little difficult to find the correct meaning of this term :)\n\nEdit: I'm not sure why people downvote a lot on Reddit, especially since I wasn't obnoxious, rude, or cocky. I'm simply asking because I want to know my correct student status, and also so I can apply to scholarships only if I'm eligible. ",

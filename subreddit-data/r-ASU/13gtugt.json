Should I make a MS word document to start writing?\n2. What should I write? And how long should I write? I have been listed on the dean's list four times. Will writing about it help me a lot?\n3. What websites should I use to promote my resume?\n\nThanks in advance \u263a\ufe0f",

It is pretty standard for CS majors and make sure the formatting passes through ATS screening software because bad formatting can lead to a quick automated rejection. Stick to one page using this format and you'll be golden\n\nYou can use Word, Docs, Latex anything would be good",

Both of these are outdated and if you see anything telling you include them, that reference is probably outdated too.  Includes RELEVANT social media (linkedin) and portfolio links along with basic email + phone contact info.\n\n* Education, Experience, Highlights (projects), and Technical skills all clearly labeled sections with bullet points\n\n* No narrative styling.  Save that for your cover letter, just the facts here.\n\n* Skills section CATEGORIZED and listed, different reviewers may be looking at or for different things and you want them to find it\n\n* Consistent use of page position, typeface, and size to create visual clarity rather than wasted whitespace.\n\n* Can be easily copy / pasted into online job application portals with minimal reformatting\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnly two minor thing I see is, as a hiring manager, first I personally prefer to see both the date range as well as the duration at a glance so...\n\n * May 2019 - July 2019, 3 mos\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd second it's nice to have the state / city you currently reside in.  You'll probably be asked to provide this by whatever HR protal / rep but what actually makes it to the technical reviewer's inbox is just a huge PDF of cover letters and resumes.",

            "comment": "The reality is that your question is a little more complex than what you have been answered and you have to divide it into 2 sections.\r  \n\r  \nThe first is how to write the resume and the other is where to look for a job.\r  \n\r  \nSince writing your resume is something you should not take lightly and since you are just studying, the format you choose should emphasize your skills and studies more than your experience. Personally, I don't like the format proposed in Jake's Resume since it puts your skills to the end and in your case with little work experience, the reality is that you need to attract a little more attention.\r  \n\r  \nAt Simple Ideas we create a PDF with the steps that we consider you should take into account when making your resume. You can see it here and it comes with free templates:\r  \nHow to Write The Ultimate Resume: [https://simpleideas.website/the-ultimate-curriculum/](https://simpleideas.website/the-ultimate-curriculum/)\n\n\r  \nor if you prefer to go directly to the post of our page\r  \n[https://simpleideas.website/the-ultimate-resume-secrets-tips-to-get-the-best-results/](https://simpleideas.website/the-ultimate-resume-secrets-tips-to-get-the-best-results/)\n\n\rI would love to tell you everything you should consider here but the answer would be too long. \n\nIn summary:\r  \n\r  \n1. Do it in MS Word \n\n2. Try to make it a maximum of 1 single page since you do not have much work experience\n\n3. Write an attractive headline and Summary or Goal\n\n4. MAKE IT ATS FRIENDLY, that means use a format than is easy to read and find info for The applicant tracking systems.\r  \n\r  \nNever brag about an achievement that is not related to the job you are looking for.\r  \n\r  \nRegarding where you can post it. Although there are several pages to publish it, the reality is that it is not something that we would recommend beyond updating your LinkedIn profile (I know, we hate that platform but human resources uses it a lot to hire staff). \n\nManually search for job offers on different pages such as indeed, flexjobs, upwork, linkedin and even in newspapers. It is always better to look for a job that appeals to you and not to be hired for anything that in the end if you don't like it will only get in the way of your resume.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, you can also contact a headhunter and tell them what you are looking for, the only problem here is that they are not cheap.\r  \n\r  \nI hope this helps you and if you want more info please write to us",

Normally, the resume should be no longer than 2 pages and contains the following components:\n\n(a) Education\n(b) Certificate\n(c) Professional Experience \n(d) Research Experience (if applicable)\n(e) Work Experience \n(f) Honors/Awards\n\n3.

You can upload your resume on Handshake or LinkedIn\n\nFeel free to DM me for more information!",

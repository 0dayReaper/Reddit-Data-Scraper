But I have been very pleasantly surprised.  Uber has truly covered the entire cost and it\u2019s been pretty seamless.  What are you thinking of going back to school for?",

Lord knows I've made that company enough money over the years. But I think it's really great that Starbucks and Uber offer the program at all.  I'm doing a group project rn with a bunch of Starbucks people and it's cool to see people get opportunities.  Did you go through the Starbucks program?\n\nOh, also OP - if you go back for a second degree, ASU will apply credits from your first degree program to your second degree.  So you should be able to bypass a lot of the gen ed courses and jump straight into your major.  Feel free to DM me if you want to chat.",

Starbucks college program for what its worth is the best part about working there and the health insurance. Now I'm done with school there's no real benefit to staying. If anyone finds themselves in a rut I definitely suggest the Starbucks route. You dont have to come out of pocket for much at all.",

It won't hurt at all to get learning, whether you decide to go the long haul with ASU or not.\n\nI don't know you situation, but part of my decision making with this was realizing the value my existing degree already has, and focusing more on building a career from that, with an eye on developing the skills and topics I began studying w/ ASU (software).",

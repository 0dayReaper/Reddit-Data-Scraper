    "postText": "I'm enrolled in an 300+ level Anthro course for Summer A session and I feel a bit disappointed? It's going over information I learned in my intro cultural anthropology course at Community College. I enrolled in the course because I was excited to do more of a deep dive into the content but I feel like that won't happen. Has anyone else been disappointed with the course rigor as a undergrad? I'm an online student if that makes any difference. I always thought I would get more challenging course work being in university but so far it all feels equivalent to my community college I started at.",

There's 2 ways to look at this.\n\n1. 100 and 200 gives broad background, are weed out courses and don't care if there's an easy trick. 300 and 400 have a more specific idea and assume you know the background, so they'll make use of tricks to speed up the process or just want to see how you apply your skills in the context.\n\n2. 100 and 200 classes are just weed out courses that want to cut the amount of people in tougher programs, and/or to make as much money from the people that keep retaking them. \n\n121+131 Physics 1 and 2 hurt, 498/598 synthetic biology and metabolic engineering was fun and easy.",

I'm a Global Studies major and the community College course I took two years ago was Cultural Anthropology and my course right now is Peoples of Latin America which utilizes a cultural anthropology framework. I guess they kinda have to recap if someone didn't take an Anthropology course for early gen Ed like I did.",

I definitely felt like my humanities classes were more like the 400/500 class I mentioned. Didn't seem like they were trying to screw you and more like they wanted to see how you used your readings/subject knowledge and provide you with that knowledge if you didn't have it.",

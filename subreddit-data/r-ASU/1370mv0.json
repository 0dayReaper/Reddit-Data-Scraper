I'm wondering if there is any meaningful difference between the different buildings and if there are any I should avoid or look for. Right now I'm leaning towards building I, J,  or H.",

A wagon/cart of sorts would be handy or reusable bags that are less likely to break and can carry more could be a worthwhile investment",

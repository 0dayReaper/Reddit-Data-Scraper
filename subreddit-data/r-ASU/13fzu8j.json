            "comment": "Improve your chances by boosting your resume with some things university might not be teaching you. When I interview interns each year, I look for skills that speed up their onboarding and will allow them to jump into a team without the engineering mentors having to hand hold on basics. Make sure you understand how source control works and are familiar with at least one of the common tools like GitHub. I always recommend to the high school students that I work with that they use a source control repository for all of their projects even if their teachers/professors don\u2019t require it. The faster you become competent in source control, CI/CD and devops pipelines, the more valuable you will be to any team. \n\nOther topics that might improve the appeal of your resume would be any training or education you have done on docker, K8S, and a cloud stack. For cloud, it doesn\u2019t have to be a specific one. If you understand one (AWS let\u2019s say) then I know you can translate that to our environment with Azure and GCP. The core concepts are the same. \n\nEverything I mentioned is covered for free on YouTube or the company\u2019s website documentation/learning areas. You just have to be willing to put in the time. But if you are going this route with your career, you have to be willing to be a life-long learner anyway so it should excite you.\n\nHaving some knowledge on those topics with a base level of proficiency so you can put them on your resume in a skills section is going to immediately grab my attention when skimming through the hundreds that we receive.\n\nHope this helps",

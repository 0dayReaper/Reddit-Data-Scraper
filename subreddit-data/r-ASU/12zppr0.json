    "postText": "Currently an online student taking classes, before I came to ASU I found pride keeping my GPA above a 3.0 (my high-school GPA was 2.0 barely and I dropped out of college on my first go so it's a real change) but with my circumstances outside of school I'm struggling to get it back to that level atm. \n\nIs passing classes good enough? I know some internships require certain GPA and there's possible scholarships (maybe??) when keeping it high but what else does it do?\n\n Am I stressing myself out over arbitrary ideals or does this number hold weight in more ways than I think?\n\nEdit: I'm a Physics major/sustainability minor",

It only mattered once we went on to get our masters. \n\nFor op, the question is, is the stress worth the payoff? \n\nObviously there will be exceptions, there are to virtually everything, but probably not enough to make it a major stress point as op indicated it was, if you don\u2019t care about post secondary school.\n\nI mean the moral of the story is it\u2019s all relative to goals, what op plans to do with a physics degree is important. If op thinks they might want a masters or doctorate, then absolutely GPA matters for getting into a good program. \n\nEntering the job market? Most employers don\u2019t care about any undergrad gpa below 4.0 typically doesn\u2019t belong on the resume in the first place. But this also depends where op wants to work. A handful of select competitive companies might care- but that is not most suppliers by any means",

I have hired new engineers and interns at a few different places. While I never really cared about a 2.8 vs. a 3.3 HR in these companies most definitely set limits. If OP doesn't want to work for a large company, which is totally fair if they don't, then the smaller places tend to have less bureaucracy.  \n\nI work for a massive medical device conglomerate in manufacturing engineering and recruiting would never bring us a candidate with a low GPA. Now, is that right? I don't think so, but it's how this big conglomerate works.",

Now that I\u2019m in college I have redeemed myself and try hard to get the best grades as possible. So I know what it\u2019s like to hold yourself to a higher standard. \n\nIf you\u2019re having struggles that are keeping you from retaining that 3.0+ GPA, I would try not to be so hard on yourself. Life happens. Trying to be a perfectionist only adds to the stress. \n\nEven if an internship position lists a high GPA as a requirement, you shouldn\u2019t let that keep you from applying. A good company won\u2019t disqualify you for that, and will look at other things like your experience, skills, personality, etc. You are more than a GPA.\n\nIf you ever want to talk about school, grades, internships, etc. feel free to message me anytime!",

In fact I can't recall a time when HR asked any potential employee their GPA if they were a fresh graduate.\n\nThat being said make sure that you are taking advantage of ASU's opportunities for internships and work studies. Even if you don't get a 3.0 or higher it still looks really good if you can tell someone I have practical lab experience or I've done internships at x&amp;y companies. Grades don't mean shit in the professional workplace but what does mean shit is experience and practical application of that experience.\n\nYou can also undertake personal projects outside of an academia setting and as long as you build a portfolio that details that project's pipeline you can present it at your HR meeting and you will be a mile above everybody else's head and shoulders in terms of potential.",

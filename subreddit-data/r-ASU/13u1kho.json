    "postText": "I recently interviewed for a management intern position. The job posting stated it was a 12-month job intended for currently enrolled grad students and paid $20/hr. I never asked during the interview, but I am wondering if all management intern positions provide tuition remission in addition to the $20/hr pay. If so, is it free, or is it reduced, and what about summer terms? I'm also wondering about medical benefits, and if the job consistently clocks in at 20 hours per week, even during summer. Has anyone ever worked as a management intern and can speak more about this? I couldn't find any information on the job posting or on the ASU website. \n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "It depends on the FTE/number of hours you work. As long as it is 20 or more you get tuition remission + all the benefits (health, pension, etc). \n\nIt\u2019s not 100% free tuition but it\u2019s insanely cheap. Pays for any semester you\u2019re working (including summer). \n\nI just finished my management intern at graduation and was promoted to staff. It\u2019s essentially like being a staff member (because you are) with the flexibility of being a student worker (because you\u2019re hourly).",

It's good to know that you have the opportunity to extend or be promoted to staff. It sounds like a pretty cushy position to get. \n\nHow many classes did you take while working the 20 hr per week job?  Was it manageable? I'm currently enrolled in 4 classes for Fall 2023 but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew.",

But my program had many production/project based classes rather than lectures. \n\nI also was \u201cpromoted\u201d from Student Worker to Management Intern so my department was familiar with me and whatnot.",

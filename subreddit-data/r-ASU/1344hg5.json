    "postText": "Hello (: so recently I had a financial change and can now go for a bachelors (yay)! I was looking at a BS in BDA or CIS but recently found out I don\u2019t meet the direct entry requirements. I meet the general transfer student requirements (gpa,credit transfers) but I don\u2019t meet the HS related requirements due to low ACT score (score= 20) and low hs gpa (i was an idiot slacker in HS\u2026.really paying for that now). I was a little surprised they would even care about HS with transfer students though. Anyways, I am not too Interested in retaking the ACT as I am now 24 L O L. At this point I\u2019m completely bummed and wondering what\u2019s a good next step. ASU has an amazing online business school and amazing network opportunities so I\u2019d still like to pursue. I saw that there is an option to do the portfolio -it seems crazy competitive and not reassuring but seems it\u2019s my only option. I was thinking of going for a BA in info tech finishing the required portfolio classes and later applying to switch into a BS..?? but honestly this seems like a waste... any advice on what to do? Should i stop crying and just start with the BA (if so, which BA will align with BS in BDA/CIS?) I am mostly interested in the tech side of business or tech in general if that helps. \n\nI am going to speak with an advisor but hearing from other people never hurt!",

You can get admitted as a general transfer student and take those classes, achieve the required GPA and try entering the business program that way.\n\nYou can also take those freshman/sophomore courses at a Maricopa community college to save some money (or for the smaller class size if that's what you prefer), get a high GPA and then request admission to ASU's business program.\n\nI'm in ASU's school of engineering for a BS in CS and what I did was take most of my freshman/sophomore courses at Scottsdale Community College and then transferred to ASU as a CS major to complete my junior/senior semesters.\n\nHowever, I don't know if this is a possible path for all majors or how the school of business does admissions, but either way I'm sure you have a decent set of options.\n\nHere is some additional info:\n\n[About MyPath2ASU](https://admission.asu.edu/transfer/maricopa)\n\n[MyPath2ASU Transfer Guide](https://webapp4.asu.edu/transfercreditguide/app/transfermap)",

So starting with a BA doesn't waste any time, you're taking the same classes. Major related classes don't start until at least Term 5. You should call the Advising office to have a Trabafer Evaluation performed.",

    "postText": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking at recording a couple of albums starting this summer, it seems like this is the one outlet where I can blow some steam off from work and school. With that being said, I will be looking for a graphic designer that can help me with a couple of concepts for a new logo and some album art. Not sure if this is the right avenue, so I understand if it isn't pertinent, I can gladly take this down. If not, please get in touch to discuss ideas, budget, your rates, etc.\n\nThank you!",

You might be looking to commission a custom artwork from an art student not a graphic design. Unless of course your art is going to be more graphical based (I.e. edited photos, illustration/vector artwork, text/lettering, etc). \n\nSource: been in graphic design for many years, and am now doing a lot of design work for more creative endeavors. \n\nGood luck finding someone to help you out and always follow your goals!",

If you end up getting the booklet entirely done in artwork, you can use a program like inDesign to stitch the pages together and then send those files to a printer. It\u2019s a bit finicky but you can do it yourself with a monthly subscription to adobe. Just pay for the month, put it together and cancel, you\u2019ll save a ton of money that way.",

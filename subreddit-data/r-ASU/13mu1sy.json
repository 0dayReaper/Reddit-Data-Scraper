    "postText": "Hi! I'm a non-traditional 34(M) student starting up this fall in the Astronomical and Planetary Science path going completely online since I live about 3 hours from campus. I've transferred credits from my previous school in Utah where I had studied to be a science teacher. I've been teaching for almost a decade now (high school science), but have dropped it to pursue this passion of mine. I'm really blessed to have such a supportive wife and kids as I begin this new journey.\n\nI'm really looking forward to being a student again, but if be lying if I said I wasn't even a little nervous. It's been so long since I've had to engage with any sort of physics or mathematics that's more rigorous than teaching basic high-school, algebra-based physical sciences (physics, chemistry, astronomy). I'm confident I can get back into it, but I still am a little anxious after having made this major decision to change careers, that perhaps I'm not good enough. Maybe that's just the imposter syndrome talking. \n\nBut besides the anxiousness, I am really excited to get started this fall! Check the image for the classes I've signed up for so far. Who else out there is also crazy enough to study the sky?",

It's basically the home for NASA research, Mars rover cam mission control, the Meteorite Studies center, and they have a public meteorite gallery (and vault that's highly secured and protected) along with other cool exhibits. They also do [3D Astronomy shows](https://sese.asu.edu/3d-astronomy) on Wednesdays and Saturdays. They also have a lot of events throughout the year but the one that you should maybe try to do is [ASU Open Door](https://www.opendoor.asu.edu/), where the ASU welcomes the community to their campuses. Basically all schools and departments at ASU have fun activities and demonstrations for the whole family, especially for kids of all ages.",

I know online is different from in person but try to use all the resources given to you and attend office hours regularly. Doing that helps a lot if you're not sure about the material. I attended community college before transferring to ASU and was a chemistry tutor there so I saw my fair share of older (30+ y.o.) students. They had a focus and determination that was much different from the traditional/younger students and would often end up being some of the best students in class. Impostor Syndrome is real and as a minority in STEM, non-traditional student, first gen student/American, and low income, it would sometimes hit hard. You have to remember what your goals are and look back at your accomplishments and how much you've improved. You've definitely got this!",

From what I understand, even if I don't find jobs directly connected to astronomy this will at least give me experience in science communication and data analysis. I liked being a teacher but I finally realized it's not something I wanted to stay in for decades. Basically, I decided I wanted to do the science myself. And maybe find something that pays even a little better than public schools.\n\nLong-term dream goal: I'd love to be a researcher/professor fully engulfed in studying &amp; writing about extrasolar planets, supernovas, galaxies, black holes/AGNs, or whatever I might find a greater interest in as I further my studies.",

I just want to advise all students going through this program that it alone will not be enough to get you into graduate school for the most part. The program is not anywhere near rigorous enough for graduate schools to take you seriously even with research. If you want to be a researcher you generally will need a PhD at minimum (Astronomy and astrophysics are some of the most oversaturated graduate programs) and in order to do that you will need to generally have research in undergrad and at minimum Calc I-III, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra (or Math Methods I and II for these), Classical mechanics I-III, and Quantum I-II. \n\nThe program seems to be good for scientific communication purposes and for really interesting classes, but aside from that, it\u2019s not going to be enough for graduate programs or research jobs. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this to sound negative, just wanted to give you a forewarning about expectations with the program.",

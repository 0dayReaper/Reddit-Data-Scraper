    "postText": "Here's some context, I(Asian) barely passes Calc I with minimal effort and planned to try better for Calc II. The professor was helpful but horrible at explaining aome things and that caused me to dip below a C as a max final score. I decided to drop it in hopes of Rio Salado college helping me during the summer but I suck at understanding the Imperial system and the extensive paragraphs of word explanations and questions. \n\nDoes anyone know of a summer class or early fall class that has the same curriculum, math system and teaching method as ASU?",

There is a significant difficulty between calc 1 and 2 and it can take some people by surprise so you'll probably need more than minimal effort. I'd recommend retaking it at a community college and watching Professor Leonard's videos on YouTube concurrently with the class throughout the semester. His videos made calculus easy for me.",

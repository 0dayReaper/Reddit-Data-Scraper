    "postText": "I am going to lose my scholarship, and even if I take a summer school course my GPA will only be brought up to a 2.98 which is right below the 3.0 mark sadly. And I cannot afford to take multiple of these courses (I would have to pay for these myself). I was wondering how the appeal process works. I fell ill for a period of time during school which set me back quite a bit, and I ended up in the hospital overnight. I do have a doctor's note from this but it just states that I was kept overnight and that I would be able to return to class within the next week. Is this enough supporting documentation for me to be able to keep my scholarship? I am very worried because I have not spoken to my parents about this, and they are the ones paying for my tuition so I want to get ahead of this now. I don't know how the process goes or if I need more in-depth documentation so any guidance would be helpful! I am feeling discouraged right now and don't know what I can do to help my situation.",

Hope this helps!",

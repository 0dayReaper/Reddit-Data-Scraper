    "postText": "Hey guys, \n\nCan someone explain to me why my dars state that I need 15 credits remaining but I need 26 hours in upper division, 3 in college/school,13 in major, and 9 hours in related areas. Do those 15 credits cover those hours? I am sorry if this is a dumb question I'm new at using dars. Thanks for your help :)",

            "comment": "I would email your advisor for clarification, but I imagine you need only 15 credits to reach the credit number needed to graduate. However, you still have outstanding credits needed to fulfill requirements so you can graduate with your degree. I know I technically have all the credits I need from previous AP classes, but some of them don't apply to my major, so they are just floating there and being counted as credits that go towards the total credit number needed to just graduate.\n\nI'm sure you can also cross reference some of your credits. If you take 13 credits for your major and all are upper division, this would satisfy both methods. Again, I would reach out to your advisor to clarify! Hope this helps.",

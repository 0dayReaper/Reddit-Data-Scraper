    "postText": "Hi folks, I am facing a dilemma on what to report for my GPA. I made an Excel file calculating my GPA on the 4.00 and 4.33 scales. However, some schools don't have A+ or they assign the same grade points for A and A+. \n\nMy GPA is as follows:\n\n* Cumulative 3.71/4.00 or 3.79/4.33\n* Major 3.73/4.00 or 3.82/4.33\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think I should do? Thanks!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/13fx4xz)",

ASU's GPA is based on the 4.00 scale but the A+ grade points (4.33) are there to reward those who did very well and got high scores.\n\n\"[Although the plus/minus scale includes a grade of A+ with a value of 4.33, the cumulative GPA is capped at 4.00.](https://students.asu.edu/grades#gpa)\"",

I literally just took my final GPA based on &lt;40hrs from my BS granting school (3.1 so seriously stop worrying) and ignored the grades (bad and bad) from my pre-transfer school (which was ASU anyways - seriously, STOP WORRYING)\n\nJust put down 3.7 GPA and send ASU your transcripts. You'll be fine.\n\nAnd yes, I was accepted to the MBA program pretty much immediately.",

They also mentioned that if I wasn\u2019t accepted into ME and I was admitted to IT, if I did well I could change my major. Is this true? Has anyone had any experience with this or know if this is even possible? I don\u2019t want to waste my money if this isn\u2019t even possible. I don\u2019t want an IT degree. I already have a useless degree and don\u2019t need a second. I work in aerospace and want to get into engineering.",

            "comment": "You can change your major, but it\u2019s important to know why you were denied admission to mechanical engineering. The most common of these is missing a laboratory science course. The Fulton School of Engineering wants you to have completed 2 laboratory science courses (physics, biology, or chemistry) as part of their admission criteria. Plus a 3.0 GPA. Those are fairly easy to hit. If you\u2019re missing the lab science, as I suspect you are, consider taking one (and any other gen eds you need) at a community college and then transfer to ASU in the Spring",

They can help you with what classes to schedule to increase your chances of getting a switch.

You can take MAT 265 instead of MAT 210 and you can take 2 of the SQ courses required for ME to also fill you IFT science requirements. That way you aren\u2019t throwing credits away if you stay in IFT but also make a solid case for success potential in ME.",

    "postText": "Hello, i have been applying for on campus jobs since fall 22 and i have had more than 50 rejections. I finally got an interview yesterday but today i was informed that the interview was for a position that would open this summer. I had to deny it since i am already in my home-country for the summer break. I am in DESPERATE need of work and i HAVE to get a job before the upcoming fall semester begins and to make things worse, most of the job openings right now are for positions that would open in the summer semester. Can anyone give any tips on where i might be going wrong and when to start applying for fall 23 openings?? Any referrals are also appreciated. Thank you.",

            "comment": "50? That's a lot! It makes me wonder how much time is going into crafting your application materials for each position. If you haven't already, I'd try narrowing your scope to positions that really speak to either your skills, your area of study, or your experience. Each cover letter and resume should be tailored for their respective positions by using key words and phrases straight from the job descriptions where applicable. \n\nExample: if you have customer service experience and the job description explicitly states \"experience with assisting customers,\" say you have \"experience assisting customers\" instead of just listing customer service as a skill. \n\nFor more tips like this, I suggest checking out [ASU's Career and Professional Development Services](http://career.asu.edu). More jobs for the fall may open around July and early August, so hopefully in the meantime you can check out the resources there if you havent already.",

            "comment": "Commenting here as someone who screens and interviews hundreds of students (and, in turn, hires 40-50 student workers a year) at ASU.\n\nMy main advice\u2026 don\u2019t use AI or scripts to apply to literally everything. When I have to read through hundreds of resumes and cover letters for each posting I have- ChatGPT\u2019s (or any other AI) algorithm is very obvious. It\u2019s also obvious that you are applying for every/any job\u2026not necessarily the one I\u2019m posting. Not a disqualifier\u2026 but not helping yourself either.\n\nFor my screenings, here is what stands out to me:\n\n1.\tWrite something that shows you have an interest in, or experience with, what I\u2019m hiring for. Odds are, you have little to no experience in what I\u2019m hiring for..that\u2019s ok..I\u2019ll train you. It really makes you stand out if you have an interest in the field. \n\n2.\t Make sure you are attaching the correct cover letter to the right job. I\u2019ll notice this really quick, and usually move on to some else who has better attention to detail. This isn\u2019t necessarily a disqualifuer, it really isn\u2019t helping you compete against 250 of your peers.\n\n3.\tPlease don\u2019t email me with a ChatGPT generated email; \u201cI hope this email finds you well\u201d and \u201cbest regards\u201d are two major phrases that AI uses in generated emails. If English isn\u2019t your native  or primary language, that\u2019s awesome! Don\u2019t stress having a highly polished prose, I\u2019ll value your honesty and genuine communication more, anyway.\n\n4.\tFor interviews, please dress as you would for the job. I\u2019ve had several interviews where it looked like the interviewee just finished a workout at the SDFC. If hired, you would ostensibly be representing my department- this is a subtle way of demonstrating that you can do this.\n\n5.\tMy hiring process has several moving parts and isn\u2019t quick. While I can make selection decisions pretty quickly, HR usually takes a bit of time to make sure all the paperwork is filed, boxes are checked, and that everything is approved. If you are an international student, this process includes working with the ISSC- which adds even more time. Considering these \u201cexternal\u201d processes, the absolute fastest I can go, from posting the job announcement to the hired candidate attending our new employee orientation is between six to eight weeks. Typically, it takes me ten. Way too long for me\u2026but that\u2019s just the speed that it goes.\n\nBe patient, and remember, no news is good news. BrassRing (ASU\u2019s HR software) is quick to send out rejection notices. If you haven\u2019t heard anything about jobs you\u2019ve applied for, you are still a candidate.\n\nWhile I prefer in-person interviews, I can (and do) accommodate requests for interviews via zoom. It\u2019s worth asking if you are offered an interview but are out of the country until the fall semester. \n\nHang in there!",

I\u2019ve have several of my top-preforming student workers automatically terminated because they missed their GLACIER paperwork deadline.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a manager at the Sun Devil Marketplace on College.  As you close in on Fall (assuming you\u2019re not already employed by then), go to Follett.com and find the jobs section of the site.  Fill out the application and wait for the temp agency to contact you.  If you fill out all of their paperwork and can tolerate their being significantly late to call you for your extremely short phone interview, there\u2019s an EXCELLENT chance you\u2019ll get a temp to perm slot for Fall.  After a small probationary period, Follett hires outright.\n\nBe aware that you are also going up against a ton of international students that can\u2019t work off campus and this can limit the number of opportunities for domestic students.  The good news is that the international students can only work 20-hours a week.  Also, if you\u2019re a domestic student, you can work off campus nearby.  \n\nIf you\u2019re searching online for off-campus jobs, search the zip code 85281 and limit yourself to whatever mileage you are comfortable traveling.\n\nEdit: This is just general advice and not necessary for the OP in particular.",

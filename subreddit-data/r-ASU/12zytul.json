BIO 312 is a bunch of BS; you have a recitation section and actual exams. The other one they offer an A session icourse and it\u2019s a relatively straight forward A. I haven\u2019t taken either yet but my friends who got ahead on their course work were getting killed in BIO 312 while those in BIO 4\u2013 (don\u2019t remember the exact class code) where having a breeze of a class.",

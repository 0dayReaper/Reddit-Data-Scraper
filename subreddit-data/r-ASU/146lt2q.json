Just buy index funds (like the S&amp;P 500) and hold.\n\nFollowing the news can, in theory, lead to higher returns, but nearly all investors perform worse than index funds. It's just not worth the additional effort for lower returns.",

You have to take both economics classes beforehand, I believe.\n\nWhat is your knowledge level of the stock market? The best way to learn more is to read up about business news and opening up a brokerage account like Robinhood or TD Ameritrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbtw, don't fall into the trap of thinking that the stock market, Real Estate, etc. are indicators of the general economy and function in the same way, because that's false.\n\nSure, there might be idiosyncratic risk or systematic risk that may affect many markets, but there is far and few in-between these things with the economy.",

I recommend FIN 380 for everyone who wants a general intro.",

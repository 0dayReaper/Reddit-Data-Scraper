The problem here (which the meme describes) is that there\u2019s no transparency on how much the school is willing to protect us and where the danger is at school. It reflects badly on the school if we do not get news on where the cases are on all campuses. We do not want names of the students who contracted COVID, we just want confirmation on which residence halls to avoid, and which classes are taking pre-caution if a student does have COVID. I understand it\u2019s a two-way responsibility between the students and the university, but considering how LARGE ASU is as a whole, the university needs to set a great example for us to protect ourselves.",

Say you are out of meal swipes you can instead use it to buy a meal from the dinning hall or even on stuff like a speaker or skateboard from the POD market if you have enough.",

I had to call dining office to get it because it wasn\u2019t advertised, but they\u2019ll give it freely just before school starts.",

    "postText": "Hi there! So I personally am not a student at ASU, but my partner is. He is a full time online student and also works full-time. \n\nRecently we ran into a road block with his summer semester. So his FAFSA doesn't cover summer semester if I remember, and he has to pay at least $700 to be able to enroll in another semester. Because of this he missed being able to enroll for summer semester. \n\nIs there any aid or loans we could apply for to cover the tuition that FAFSA does not? \n\nHe has a meeting with his advisor next week but I'm just frustrated with this whole thing because now he's being a semester. \n\nThank you so much for any information!",

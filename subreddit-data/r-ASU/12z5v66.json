    "postText": "I\u2019ve fuckin had it with group projects. I don\u2019t really know many people as I\u2019m quite uninvolved in all things campus/class related so for my group projects I\u2019m usually assigned or pick random people from the class. This doesn\u2019t sound like a problem right? Wrong, this semester I\u2019ve stumbled upon the most lazy, unambitious, sloth like people you could possible imagine. What have I done about it? Enabled it (I think). Why? Because (1) The professors don\u2019t give 2 shits about it (2) Maybe if I don\u2019t mention it to these lazy folks faces they\u2019ll be more willing to do their work (hasn\u2019t worked). \n\nI hope all those who work hard in their teams and projects succeed and you lazy pos get a rude awakening once you make it to the 9-5 grind (if you make it that far (I have doubts)).\n\nAlso, maybe a professor or someone smarter than I could explain why individuals on a project can\u2019t be graded on the work done by the individual? \n\nSincerely, \nDisgruntled &amp; Pissed Teammate",

Things that if not done you can point to the paper trail and say this is why our project isn't done and this is who is responsible. If they don't do it, you don't do it. You report them.\n\nIn the real world you will most likely end up being responsible for other people. If you keep the no one will do but you mentality, it will kill you. It killed my father. He worked 60 hours a week. The stress gave him tumors which eventually turned to cancer. \n\nAt home he never gave us chores. In the office he was doing the work of 3 people. He would rather do extra work than confront or manage anyone. He never fired the incompetent members of his team. After he died most of the people under him were fired.\n\nYou need to learn how to do this right now.",

As for partners you might want to pick and choose more carefully. In my experience if someone\u2019s a little quiet and looks really nerdy they make really good lab partners and great friends. Try to be friendly say \u201cHello my name is\u2026 do you have a partner? Do you want to work with me on this?\u201d Unless they have a partnership already they won\u2019t say no, like actually. Following these 2 rules you should be fine for the most part. Every now and again you\u2019ll get screwed over by assigned partners and it will end up bad. It happened to me in a certain class, where me and a friend of mine were the scapegoats and nearly ended up failing. I just took the L and moved on. This has happened to me just once, and I\u2019m a Junior, who has done a lot of projects with others. \n\nTL;DR: Don\u2019t rely on random people, find partners you trust and ones you can communicate your concerns to. You should be fine",

Are there any classes I could get out of the way during the summer before I start?? \n\nNote: i will also be working in a nursing home full time, so are the classes able to be completed while feeding ol granny? Thank you!",

So even if you start at college algebra you'll be able to work up to whatever you need. Maybe try to get MAT243 out of the way since you are a CS major.",

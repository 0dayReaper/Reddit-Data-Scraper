This means that you and 10 to 20 other students will take many of the same classes together your first semester. Your advisor is asking you to take the math placement test so they know which math course to place you into.\n\nIf you feel decently confident about your math skills, you can take it once, it will give you studying material for the sections that you did not do well on, then take it a second time to get the desired score.\n\nYou could also do review on something like Kahn Academy.",

I literally had ap credit for calc 1. After taking it once, I knew what topics I needed to study and a week later I retook the aleks and was able to go into calc 2 freshman year",

This will allow your advisor to get you into a math course during orientation so you can leave with a full schedule. \n\nYou can take the placement test up to 3 times. If you place in a higher class after orientation, you can work with your advisor to change your math class. \n\nBut the point is to get your butt in a seat so you can enter with a full and accurate schedule.",

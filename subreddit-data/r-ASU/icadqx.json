There was no validation or clarification and the context of the question it was mentioned that there were students hanging around each other with masks down or off. And nobody enforced anything. The context made it clear that they were not physically distant... Just outside.",

Where crow literally said he saw people physically together outdoors and didn't bother to enforce a mask. But apparently that's \"enforcement\" to you. Then the other guy came on and said it's all about reducing viral load because we can kill \"one virus\" (how retarded it is to say that) then literally said by wearing a mask OR staying physically distant. Context literally paints the entire picture because that was directly in response to Crow's observation of students being outdoors.\n\nEdit: and now, only a day later... they release a video saying the same shit I said. Masks outdoors are a thing. \"common sense enforcement\" was clearly a lie as ASU wants masks in all \"Common\" areas which include sidewalks and building frontages. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdrNM4rNV8",

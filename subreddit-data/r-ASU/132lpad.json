    "postText": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore at community college and have already set up my classes to transfer in august (Junior level with maxed 65 credit hours from other institutions). I wasn\u2019t able to get into the Finance B.S program as I didn\u2019t take an SAT because of Covid and the fact I was going to community college didn\u2019t really see the need. I\u2019m wondering if anyone has had any experience with being able to switch their degree? I am taking fundamentals of finance and personal financial management in the fall and was going to try and get recommendations from my professors. (Currently in the financial planning B.A.)",

I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, it it absolutely a good idea to be on good terms with your instructors. \n\nHowever, WPC operates on metrics. There are other ways to be directly admitted to a BS business degree. You can find the full direct admission options [here](https://students.wpcarey.asu.edu/degrees-and-advising/degree-programs/direct-admission-requirements). \n\nAt the bottom of that webpage, you\u2019ll also find information on the portfolio process, which is essentially a petition to be admitted into a business major.",

            "comment": "When I came from CGCC with an Associate in general Business I did a portfolio request to be admitted to the Accountancy B.S. program without having to take the SAT or ACT (I am an old lady).  I had a good GPA and was awarded high honors from CGCC so pointing that out helped.\n\nWhen I returned Fall 2022 after being out since Jan 2019, I decided that I wanted to change to B.S. in BDA.  This time my GPA was the issue as I had a 2.98 not a 3.0.  Fortunately, I had 2 general higher division business classes I needed for any business degree to take.  Before semester was over I could show that I was going to get the grades to put me just over the 3.0 requirement.  I submitted another portfolio for the program change request and it was approved in less than a week.\n\nDefinitely submit the portfolio but make sure your 500 word essay is good with good supporting evidence to back your request.  So as long as you have the 3.0 needed to get into a B.S. and you emphasize that and that your test taking was hindered by COVID, I think you have a good shot of getting approved for the request of major change through the portfolio path.",

Things only spiral more out of control from there.\n\nBut you're right, 3% couldn't possibly be a big problem at all.",

A tuition increase of anything less than 3% is actually a cost reduction in real terms.\n\nAnd for anyone who wants to whine about inflation existing, economists generally agree it\u2019s a good thing in moderation. If money is worth the same every year, wealthy people lose nothing by hoarding their wealth in cages instead of reinvesting it.",

I doubt they\u2019ll be able to meet that commitment in the long run if inflation remains above 3%.\n\nEdit: Realizing you\u2019ve replied with something dumb and then blocking me is real mature lol.",

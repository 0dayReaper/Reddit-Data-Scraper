Most cities in the valley issue a vending license which requires proof of citizenship. We also don't have cottage food laws so most of the food is technically not \"legal.\" Sure, lots of people just break the law, but they risk arrest. In places where the law has greater enforcement we get fewer street food vendors. \n\nGuadalupe has different rules and a lot more street vendors.",

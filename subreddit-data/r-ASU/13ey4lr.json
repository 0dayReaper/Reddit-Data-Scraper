    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI have been tasked with setting up a PR2 robot, for one of the labs.  The trouble is there is no more proper documentation or video tutorials, on unpacking and setting up the robot, ever since the company Willow Garage (which made this robot PR2) went out of business.   \n\nI was wondering since ASU uses such robots, if there are any experts in other labs using the PR2, who I can meet to get knowledge transfer, to be able to get our robot up and running in our own labs out here at the Poly Campus.\n\nThank you\n\nWhitchurch",

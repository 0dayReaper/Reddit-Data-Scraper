Additionally, if anyone is looking for a roommate, please let me know.\n\nI am a 21 year old Anthropology major, graduating Spring 2024, male. A bit of a homebody, friendly and always do my share of cleaning. Would really appreciate anyone looking for an additional roommate's consideration. Open to University housing or private market. Please contact me for more details.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a current 3rd-year medical student (MD) in Phoenix who has over 100 hours of experience working with premedical students taking the MCAT, applying, and interviewing for medical school. I co-founded a nonprofit with a team of medical students in Phoenix, UCLA, and UCI. We are passionate about helping premedical students, particularly those who are disadvantaged or underrepresented in medicine and do not have access to mentorship. Our team would like to work with students during this 2023-2024 application cycle.\n\nThis is a completely free opportunity, and our goal is to make the medical application process more equitable. **If you are interested, please apply** [**here**](https://forms.gle/kE9yzmptoyNeVCPy5)",

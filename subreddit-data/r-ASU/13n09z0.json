    "postText": "If I have all 24 of my CC credits done by September (that\u2019s when the classes finish). Should I apply before or after they are done. Would I get admission into the fall if my in progress transcripts are good? Is there any way I could get admission into this fall at all? If I were to start B semester can I switch to in person in spring. \n\nAlso just curious if I\u2019m 21 my first semester on campus is spring\u201924 am I gonna make any friends at all. I know I\u2019m super late but shit happens. Thanks friends of Reddit",

            "comment": "Reach out to a transfer advisor at your cc or at ASU, they'll best know how to handle your situation. But if you want admission for fall you should submit your transfer application asap. I'm not sure**** what you mean switch to in person in spring since you're either in person or ASU Online, which cannot take any in person classes and is a whole separate program. In person students can take icourses which are online but depending on your student/finaid status you may have to take some in person classes per term so doing only icourses may not be possible.\n\nFunny how you say you're super late at 21 but recent posts have been people starting ASU at a much older age. You're not going to have any issues making friends. In general, no one really cares about your age. Join clubs, attend events, talk to people in your program/classes and you'll find your group of friends.",

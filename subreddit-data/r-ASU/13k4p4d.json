    "postText": "Hey yall, I'm a current earned admissions student with an AS in aviation maintence from a community college and a GED, I never attended school beyond 5th grade and my AS programs math requirement were quite low.\n\nSo I am currently making my way through MAT 117 in preparation for MAT 265, I plan to have both and PSY 101 and maybe ENG 101 completed by the start of term 1. I plan to take CHM 114 and ECN 211 in term 1A, HST 102 and CEE 181 for term 1B, and FSE 100 and CSE 110 for term 1C. All this while working full time.\n\nThose classes are by reccomendation of the earned admissions advisor, but it seems like they don't interface much with the actual schools. So my questions for those who may know here are:\n\nIs this enough to earn admissions into Ira a fulton for ME and EE? \nThose that have done some of these courses, is this workload actually doable? \nShould I take MAT 170 or is it possible to go straight into MAT 265 from MAT 117? \nIf this is enough, would I be able to be enrolled and started by term 2, or is the time between end of term and start of term not enough for admissions and all that?\n\nThanks for taking time to help me with this!",

It seems like you haven\u2019t taken much math so jumping into two math intensive degrees could be difficult. \n\nAlso, what value do you get from the second degree? One engineering degree is still versatile and will easily land you a job.",

            "comment": "As someone working through an EE degree at ASU, I don't recommend double majoring. From just about all the research I've done on double majoring a engineering degree with another bachelor's tends to instead lean towards getting a bachelor's and then a focused masters degree to be more marketable. \n\nBachelor's degrees in engineering can sometimes require masters degrees to work in the field, even if they \"specialize\", like RF engineering for example. Bachelor's degrees can sometimes be very general, even in EE and especially ME. \n\nI'd seek out other posts on various engineering subreddits for additional guidance. I don't feel a double EE and ME is realistic or practical.\n\nEdit: I applaud your motivation though, don't lose it. I was also a pretty lackluster student in highschool and early in college and am blown away by the complexity, workload, and stress by some courses in EE. It's amazing and interesting, but there is good reason why engineering is one of the most dropped out of/difficult majors.",

While my associates program wasn't super book oriented, I was top of my class at all the book work, like basic physics, algebra 1, and regulations.\n\nThanks for the advice!",

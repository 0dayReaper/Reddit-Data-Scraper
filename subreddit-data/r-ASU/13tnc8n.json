You should be able to go into MyASU and run a DARS, which will show you how the transfer credits fulfilled these degree requirements. If you talk to your advisor, they will run your DARS for you or you can do it yourself using this link.\n\nhttps://asuonline.asu.edu/newsroom/sun-devil-life/check-your-degree-progress-through-my-asu/\n\n(The instructions are the same whether you are an online or in-person student.)",

If they completed them outside of the US, then it just depends on how those credits transfer. That is something that would be shown in DARS.",

English 105 is basically an accelerated course that covers credits for both 101 and 102, but since you already have those it's unnecessary to take",

You can work with your advisor on how to best adjust your schedule in your first year. They will likely have you move up some other courses from the next terms so you can get ahead.",

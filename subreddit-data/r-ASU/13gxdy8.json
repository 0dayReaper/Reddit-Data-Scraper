    "postText": "Has anyone ever completed a degree and then gone back to school and used previous credits towards another degree?\n\nI was thinking about going to Phoenix College for either an Associates or Bachelors degree in something relevant to my current job. I graduated from ASU in 2017 with a Bachelor\u2019s.\nBased on scouring the PC website, it seems like it should be doable to use some of my previous credits towards my next degree (at the discretion of PC), but has anyone ever done this? How many credits were you able to transfer? I\u2019m honestly mostly just trying to avoid having to retake any of the boring General Ed stuff so that\u2019s my biggest concern.\nI also started ASU with about 20-something credits due to dual enrollment and AP classes I took in high school and am wondering if anyone has experience in transferring those kinds of credits as well, especially after such a long time.\nTIA!",

They didn't have to retake any Gen eds, only what they needed to take. Start by talking with an advisor at PC, they'll best know how to move forward with your situation. PC and other Maricopa Colleges now offer bachelor's degrees for in-demand and crucial industry careers. I saw on another comment you'd like to go into IT, not sure if you're aware [PC has a new IT Institute in downtown Phoenix](https://www.phoenixcollege.edu/iti) and are set to offer the first [Bachelor's in Information Technology starting this upcoming Fall semester.](https://www.maricopa.edu/degrees-certificates/bachelors-degrees/information-technology-bas) Reach out to the advising team or even department chair for the IT program to find out how you could transfer your previous credits into the program. You'll likely have to take courses you're deficient in to meet prerequisites for the IT courses. There are also [certificates available related to IT](https://www.phoenixcollege.edu/degrees-certificates/computer-and-information-technology) which would probably be more helpful than an associate since you've already earned a bachelor's. The great thing is you can take courses at any of the Maricopa Colleges so if you find that some classes at another Maricopa college are taught by a better professor or are just more convenient then you're free to take them elsewhere.",

They will likely be happy to take as many of your prior credit as possible within their policies. Once you know what their limits are, you can the figure out what you would have left to complete a degree from there.",

I\u2019m looking to continue in IT, especially programming, since I have pretty much no actual schooling or training in the field besides what I\u2019ve picked up from just using computers on my own, as well as what I picked up on in a different department at my work that led me to be picked up by the IT department. Overall my knowledge is pretty basic, so I\u2019d like to expand that as well as my career.",

I would also ask those in positions that you aspire to work in what credentials they have. Then determine if it makes sense for an AA or another bachelors. You may be able to get needed credentials with certificates. Asu offers some through Universal Learner and Ed Plus. This will allow you to weigh the cost of what it would take to get the education that would be helpful vs what you may expect to get out of it professionally/financially.",

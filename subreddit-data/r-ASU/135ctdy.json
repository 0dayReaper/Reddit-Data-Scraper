    "postText": "So I'm an idiot that squeezed 19 credit hours into the semester so I can graduate this May instead waiting for fall, and in my scramble to barely pass I missed the long registration window.  (luckily I remembered to register for graduation). \n\nThe site mentions a late participation fee, so Im hoping there is still a chance. however the button to register is unavailable with the message \"registration is not yet available underneath\" the site also mentions they won't accept registration the day of. \n\nSo, does anybody know who to contact or where to go for a late registration before the ceremony on the 6th?  lf there is still even an option for me this late.",

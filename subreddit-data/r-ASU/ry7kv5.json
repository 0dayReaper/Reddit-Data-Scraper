Sports teams were great, frat row was huge and rowdy, academics and research were not our strong suits. Then ASU entered the Big Bird era, ASU became a dry campus, frat row was dismantled and the \"new american university\" was born. ASU is now a great school for academics and research. \n\nSo the ASU stereotype is quite out of date at this point, but writers in Hollywood and comedians the world over haven't bothered to update their jokes. It's kind of like people that make jokes about Ethiopians being super malnourished due to the famine, when that hasn't been true for a long time.",

                                            "comment": "I'm confused and genuinely curious. Which metrics are we behind OSU on that aren't based in 'hogwash rankings'? (note: the article you link to isn't written with any semblance of credibility; it calls the college it's writing about a 'rebel college'. What the hell is a 'rebel college')\n\nI feel like the most useful comparison between OSU and ASU for prestige's sake is on their research. They are both proud R1 research universities and regularly tout their breakthroughs and scientific prowess. They both attempt to cultivate a brand based on the strength of their STEM programs, and since that seems to be what they're known for, I figure comparing them in that arena is, at the very least, a decent place to start.\n\nIn the STEM fields per empirical statistics on patents granted, articles published, and funding received/expensed (all of which are cold, hard numbers and metrics - politics aren't going to make a $1,000,000 research expenditure rank as $10,000,000) we outrank OSU on most STEM metrics. Looking at the fields that OSU typically receives prestige in:\n\n* Per the [National Science Foundation's data](https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site?method=rankingbysource&amp;ds=herd), we outrank Oregon State in total research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures 3 to 1. We also outrank them in most of the major STEM fields. Of note:\n   * In [engineering (table 54)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 18th for R&amp;D expenditures with $155,015,000 in FY2020 while OSU, the main public engineering school in the state of Oregon (UO does not have an engineering school), is ranked 74th with $50,900,000 in FY2020.\n   * In [computer and information science (table 38)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 31th for R&amp;D expenditures in FY2020 with $22,231,000 while OSU was ranked 79 with $8,913,000\n   * [In geological and earth sciences (table 39)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we lead the country (ranked 1st) with $73,544,000 in R&amp;D expenditures in FY2020, while OSU was ranked significantly lower with $5,693,000 in R&amp;D expenditures in FY2020.\n   * In [math and statistical sciences (table 46)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 33rd in R&amp;D expenditures with $5,942,000 in FY2020 while OSU is ranked 107th at $1,595,000 in FY2020.\n   * In [chemistry (table 49)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 46th in R&amp;D expenditures with $13,030,000 during FY2020 while OSU is ranked 134th with $2,788,000 in R&amp;D expenditures during FY2020.\n   * In [biological and biomedical sciences (table 41)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) during FY2020 we spent $63,293,000 while OSU spent $38,398,000. I didn't include rankings since I'm lazy and this data is a subcategory of the life sciences where the rankings are different overall.\n   * In [physics (table 50)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 52nd in R&amp;D expenditures with $12,338,000 during FY2020 compared to OSU, ranked 176th, with $1,310,000 during FY2020.\n   * In [psychology (table 51)](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22311) we're ranked 18th in R&amp;D expenditures with $17,645,000 during FY2020 compared to OSU, ranked 175th, with $1,115,000\n   * I should note that universities must compete for funding. ASU receiving more funding is a function of us having solid researchers and doing solid research.\n* You might say, \"cool u/05050503, we receive and spend a lot of money, but that doesn't translate into anything meaningful.\" The data disagree:\n   * Per the [National Academy of Inventors](https://academyofinventors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NAI-IPO-Top-100-Universities-Granted-U.S.-Utility-Patents-2020.pdf), we're top 10 for US universities granted US patents in 2020. Oregon State doesn't crack the top 100.\n   * Per the [Nature Index](https://www.natureindex.com/annual-tables/2019/institution/all/nature-science/countries-United%20States%20of%20America%20(USA)), a database of author affiliation information collated from research articles published in an independently selected group of 82 high-quality science journals maintained by one of the most prestigious journals in the world, Nature, which tracks the share of high-quality/high-impact journal publications by institution and author, ASU ranks 77th among all US institutions; OSU does not appear in the top 100.\n* As far as prestigious faculty go, ASU has four living (until recently five) Nobel Laureates among its faculty two (one living) of whom won their prizes while at ASU. Oregon State has no current Nobel Laureates among their faculty and the only OSU faculty to win a prize while at OSU was Linus Pauling (who won one in both chemistry and in peace - no small feat).\n\nI'm a fan of the Beavs (except for when we're playing them) and think Corvallis is lovely. They do some really cool and important research out there (e.g. discovering the risk the Cascadia fault poses to the Northwest and inventing the marionberry, a truly delicious achievement). However, I've never heard in any academic conversation that OSU is more 'elite' than ASU in most fields.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Typo",

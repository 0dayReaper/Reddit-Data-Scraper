I  am going to be living 10 mins from campus.\n\nHere are some things I need help with:\n\n1. What are some must do\u2019s in the area? (Stuff AZ is known for)\n\n2. I wanna know if there is anyway I could use ASU campus just to chill cause ik imma get bored of my apt. Are there libraries I can get into? Are there outdoor spaces that are nice to sit and do some work?\n\n3. What are some good food places?\n\n4. What are some long drives that are good to make? Ik San Diego is not too far out.",

There are some places you can get in without a student ID, I'd just try your hand at some libraries on campus. Also, outdoor in Phoenix Arizona? You are in for a rude awakening.\n3. I'd use Tiktok to find this. There's a lot and it all depends on what you like. I'll give my best Mexican spot, Comedor Guadalajara (near the hood but the inside is very nice)\n4. LA, Vegas, San Diego, Flagstaff (imo it's mid but if you like trees and forests you may enjoy a day or so there)",

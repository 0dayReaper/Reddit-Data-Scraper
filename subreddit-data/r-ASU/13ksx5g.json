    "postText": "Just graduated from Poly with BSE in Electrical Systems and was recently admitted to the MS program in Electrical Engineering at Tempe. My primary goal is finish up in 1.5-2 years maximum. How heavy of a course load are my current classes? This will be my first semester as a graduate student. I'm having a tough time gathering data points on the classes besides the course descriptions which seem interesting, so I thought reddit could help as always \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gp35r6oxj0b1.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=49344fee9f7a6834054a85b5e78bba7db69425bf",

I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a great course but it takes time to truly understand \n\nI don\u2019t know anything about 533 \n\nAs for taking them all together, 3 courses is a standard grad work load and you\u2019ll have weekends free if you\u2019re focused\n\nEdit:\nI should mention that 547 assumes you\u2019ve taken 341 and 445 and it helps to have taken 545 but it\u2019s not necessary \n\nIf you take 445 545 547 then you get through the entire Pozar book which is neat",

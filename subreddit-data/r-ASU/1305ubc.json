            "comment": "If you want to change your major schedule an appointment with your advisor and they fill out the paperwork with you (it\u2019s just one page) and then it takes a few days to get approved. \n\nMinoring you can add whenever you want by yourself, I think you just need to start (or maybe finish not sure exactly) your first semester. \n\n How double majoring works is you need a minimum of 30 credit hours completed at ASU which is one academic year assuming you follow the 15 credits per semester \u201cprotocol\u201d. After you complete 30 credits you can sign a \u201cpetition to pursue a concurrent degree\u201d which requires you to write what major you currently are, what major you want to add, your signature, and the signature of advisors from both schools (assuming they\u2019re different schools). The only catch is there must be 30 unique credit hours in each major but that can be determined with your advisor as well as if doing the specific double major you want to do is feasible. For example you can\u2019t double major in two different specialization of biological sciences (e.g. biomedical science and developmental biology) because the coursework is so similar that there will not be 30 unique credit hours between the two degrees.\n\nThey\u2019re all pretty easy processes, just changing/adding a major will require a meeting with an advisor to discuss feasibility as well as signing of paperwork (which is minimal).",

    "postText": "Hello, I was assigned my summer housing and am trying to plan everything. I thought I would get private room private bath, since the email said all rooms would be private room with NO shared bath (I thought it was weird wording at the time). Anyway, I was assigned a room in Willow, and at the end of the room code it says D1. I'm wondering if anyone knows what this means, and if it means I'll be in a quad, a three room, or a single. I have an Emotional Support Animal and I could foresee complications with suitemates if one of them had an allergy, and I want to know what the floorplan is going to be. Thanks!",

    "postText": "In my community college before ASU there was no +/- system an A counted as 4.0 all the way through. how common is it for universities to not do that? Because I was kind of disappointed that I no longer have a 4.0. Thankfully, I only have two semesters ( 8 classes)left and I have a 3.96. Im honestly debating just giving up though and getting a B for this last research class I\u2019m in because I hate the way the professor teaches and she\u2019s a slow grader. Does high GPA really matter that much once I graduate and I\u2019m in my field? I\u2019m doing forensic science and some criminal justice so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go for my masters at least not anytime soon.",

When some employers see a perfect 4.0, they think the applicant is lying. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s like that at every place. I wouldn\u2019t even say thats the norm. But i had a friend with a 4.0 who was looking for a job after college. Two interviewers accused her of lying lol.",

Only one student out of like 30-40 students had an A the entire semester before the curve. The only way we were able to get the curve was by pretty much confronting  her about the fact that the grades distribution was skewed (should be normally distributed) and that the Capstone, which is the last course needed for my degree this semester to graduate, was contingent on us passing that class.",

It affects USNEWS rankings and creates a situation where enrollment is congested in the lower divisions, which in turn delays everyone's progress because the university is not able to get everyone into the classes they need. That again lowers the 4 year grad rate and decreases USNEWS rankings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll that is to say that ASU wants to push as many people through in 4 years as possible. That increases USNEWS rankings, increases enrollment, generates more research output, and in turn brings in more grants and private contracts (mostly for the engineering and science departments, which are the areas big universities like ASU really shine in).",

Please share this on all of your social media and encourage people to sign!**\n\nAs some of you have seen I have been reading and responding to students\u2019 feelings about the COVID-19 situation\u2019s impact on our situations as students and the University\u2019s responses to it. I drafted this letter/petition and reviewed it with other ASU student leaders to demand the items that we students are asking for and in need of.\n\nOur goal is for this petition to receive 48,000 signatures to help these issues jump from #48 on Michael Crow\u2019s list up to #1, because that\u2019s how important they are to us, and essential for us to succeed and stay healthy.",

I personally opposed to that and saw a lot more people calling for pass/fail, especially since 70 colleges and universities have already adopted it in response to COVID-19. However, the curve petition had 20k signatures last time I saw, so I believe we should definitely discuss both to see what would work best for the most people.",

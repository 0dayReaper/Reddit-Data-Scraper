    "postText": " Hey everyone! I'm an incoming freshman for the fall 2023 semester and I decided to major in CIS because it looked interesting and something that I actually found interesting (and not pure cs). However, I don't really know anyone that has a CIS degree, so I was wondering how the classes were, your experiences with finding jobs after college, what you did, salary (if you don't mind sharing) etc. Also, I was wondering how I could find internships for CIS specifically. I wanted to try to get one at the end of freshman year, but I know that can be super difficult. Anything and everything helps!",

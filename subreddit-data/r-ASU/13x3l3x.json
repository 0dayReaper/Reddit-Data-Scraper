Judging by the 1 credit hour, it'll be pretty straightforward with easy or simple assignments. Try searching for \"LIA 194 ASU rate my professor\" and look at the reviews from past students.",

            "comment": "My opinion is if you plan on doing a minor, certificate, or a concurrent degree to start on that freshman year. A lot of people are able to do that simply by making all their electives classes for their minors if you start that early. So if you plan on doing any of the above, I would take a class for that instead of a one credit seminar. But if not, go for it! I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re interesting and not too difficult.",

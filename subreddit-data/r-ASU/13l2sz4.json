Just explore as much as you can.\n\nTalk to people, ask your advisors any questions you have asap, and look up your classes before you enroll. Like just type in the class number and search it on google sometimes you\u2019ll find some stuff that will influence your decision more than the course description.\n\nAnd go out! Sign up for events. Most people are just trying to have fun and connect. And if you get a weird feeling about something- just leave. \n\nMost of all, enjoy your education. It can be stressful, but remember, the whole point of this is to learn and set yourself up for the knowledge/insight you may need for your future career. I know it\u2019s cliche to say this, but a degree really is just a piece of paper. It\u2019s you who decides what to do with the information you are given.\n\nGood luck and congrats again. :)",

As the top commenter recommended, definitely start going through your priority tasks on your MyASU. \n\nIf you are an incoming freshman who will be on campus, make sure to start doing the orientations tasks asap and sign up for a date.

They also have an ASU 10 or ASU 11 course for 0 credits to introduce you to online education and resources. \n\nThis stuff is generally communicated through MyASU and emails, so don\u2019t worry and keep an eye out for communications from your college.",

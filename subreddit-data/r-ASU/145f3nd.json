Nothing there really pressures Reddit to change their ways so most likely this will just end up being performance art so the mods can feel good about themselves/feel like they made a difference.",

Privatizing the subreddit shows that we the mod team stand with the message and hope our actions will inspire others to try to change a system with us. Also, it is very presumptuous and ignorant of you to think that we are doing this for brownie points. Trying to show good faith to other redditors and supporting the cause doesn't mean we are doing it for ourselves.",

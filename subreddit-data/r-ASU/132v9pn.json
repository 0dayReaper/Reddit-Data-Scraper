You're not going to be regularly walking that far between every class.\n\nBoards are generally okay, although there's some new buildings where the staff will give you a hard time about it. Bikes aren't technically allowed in any ASU building unless you're putting them in an office, so you'd have to lock that up. If you're worried about it, just don't get a fancy bike and invest in a good lock; anyone stealing will be more inclined to take from the idiot who thinks a simple cable lock will do the trick (there's a lot of them). Arguably a bigger problem is people stealing anything they can off of a bike, up to and including lights, reflectors, seats, pedals, baskets, etc. \n\nWalking is not bad at all, even in summer. Just invest in a hat, figure out where the shade is, and where possible figure out which buildings you can cut through to spend less time in the sun (can be important during May-August, especially midday).",

You'll have to travel outside of the walking only zones (or walk it when in those zones) but having wheels still makes it end up faster than walking.\n\nMost classrooms will let you take them in with you but they also fit in the skateboard locks located right outside of many building entrances.\n\nThey're also far easier to maneuver and control than skateboards thanks to handlebars, large diameter wheels, and a rear brake. It'll never go flying out from under you to get smashed by cars in the road or to destroy pedestrian's ankles like a skateboard either.",

ASU used to sell the cable and lock sets pretty cheap at the Bike Co-Op on campus but not sure anymore. Use Bike Valet if you can but otherwise just make sure you secure the frame and both tires of the bike. You dont really have to worry too much about someone stealing your whole bike. They will take anything that is not locked up.",

I use an electric longboard and lean it against a wall in the classroom so it takes up minimal room while still being in my sight. When I used to use my bike, it was a pain because I had to haul around a U-Lock and Cable and the bike took up a lot of space. Unless you lock it up with the ASU valet, you might come out to your bike missing a tire or two. \nTL;DR, get something small that you can take within a classroom so you don\u2019t have to bother with locks and hauling it around.",

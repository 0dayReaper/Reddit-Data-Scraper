    "postText": "I am an out of state/online student. So they just posted under future charges what my fall tuition is going to be, and after my financial aide (loans and grants) are applied I'm going to have maybe 200 dollars to pay for books, let alone anything to help with cost of living. When I got my offer in April I checked the estimated cost of attendance using the calculator on the website and it seemed much more doable. That of course was before the increase.\n\nI saw it mentioned on here that the pell should go up, but when i called to ask about it the person I spoke to said it wouldnt because my tution is covered. He was a total condescending ass about it too, but also he didn't seem to really know what he was talking about generally so here I am once again turning to reddit for clarification. \n\nSo does anyone know more about this? Anyone else in the same boat? I was hoping I'd be able to *just* work 40 hours a week this fall while in school full time but now I'm worried.",

I got two grand first semester, taking the same credits in the fall got $800. Will it change? Idk. Is college expensive? Yes, tuition goes up every year. I suggest you start looking for scholarships asap. You can on My ASU.",

            "comment": "The Pell Grant has a maximum set by federal limits. It has nothing to do with each school's tuition. You have a Direct Costs COA, which is your total tuition, fees, and I believe books (at least $700 annual). Your total COA also has an allowance for housing &amp; meals, then they subtract your EFC per Fafsa from that, and that's how much you're allowed to be offered total. If you receive private scholarships, they are considered in that total. \n\nSo, you did not provide enough info to really answer that question. My best guess would be you have one of the smaller NAmU scholarships that does not cover your tuition/fees, so the Pell gets added to pay the rest. If those and any other government add combined pays your tuition in full, they will not increase the Pell. If the rep said it won't increase, it is most likely that you already receive the maximum. \n\nAll that said, they complete aid reviews in July and many things change then. Last year, the tuition increases were not applied for Aid purposes until July, and they adjusted some rewards then. So maybe. \n\nHave you applied for private scholarships? There are lots of the ASU Scholarships site and many are not even need based. Although, I would assume you can get need based if you get Pell. Start applying for everything.",

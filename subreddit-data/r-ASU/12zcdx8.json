            "comment": "except for a few select classes, most of the classes you are required to take 1st/2nd year are going to be fairly \u201cstandardized\u201d across the board. \nFor example Calc1-3 for engineers all have to be fairly common to one another in the material they teach because so many students take them, but that doesn\u2019t mean the professors teaching don\u2019t affect it. For example, I had a horrid calc 2 professor, but a great diff eq prof, just depends on how thorough u research on rate my prof, how you learn, and other student reccs. \nI had Dr. Renaut for 275. I have heard tons of people complain about her because when I took her she teaches without explicit examples. Everything is almost taught purely symbolically. But because of that, we didn\u2019t get calculators on our exams, but there was less \u201cconfusing\u201d arithmetic and expression manipulation, and she cared more about the overall understanding, so she gave a decent amount of partial credit. I ended up getting an A in the class not having to take the final at all. Conversely, I had friends who, arguably are much better at that kind of math, struggle due to convoluted examples or lectures from their profs, non-helpful homework etc.\nThis is something you\u2019ll run into a lot throughout your academic career so don\u2019t get discouraged! Make friends, go to office hours, talk to the profs, and you\u2019re going to do well.\npm if u have any more q\u2019s i might be able to help",

            "comment": "Diffeq is a hard class in my opinion, the difficulty in each class depends how well its taught though. With a good teacher, diffeq is on par with calc 2, but with a bad teacher its rough. I highly recommend 3Blue1Brown on youtube when you don't fully grasp a concept, in addition to the professor/tutor center of course.\n\nSomething that took me a while to figure out is that the purpose of diffeq is to make equations fit into a pattern so that you can solve them easier. That's the point of the class at least, but definitely make sure to practice it as you learn, because some things aren't so intuitive at first, but become immensely easy with practice. Highly recommend Firozzaman if he teaches it still",

However most dining options will close or have limited hours (not all, but on Poly for example all that was open this year during break was the PolyMart store in terms of University provided options).",

Classes excused by itself is just that, there are no classes, but the administrative offices and such are still open.  \n\n\nDorms are a completely different beast; generally those refer to campus operations, but there are certain times of the year, such as summer, where the dorms are closed down and not available for living.",

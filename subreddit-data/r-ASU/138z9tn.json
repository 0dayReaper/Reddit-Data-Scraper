I know there are slight differences between the two, but would they stop me from walking?\n\nJust trying to save money since the cap and gown is never worn again lol",

The Graduation site says all grads must arrive with proper regalia to be admitted. All grads will go through security checkpoint. You can sell it later on somewhere like OfferUp. Or you could look on there now for a used one.",

            "comment": "Is this at Phoenix College? If it is and the course listing mentions OER resources will be used then you'll be using the math instruction program developed by James Sousa. Regardless of the listed professor, all lecture and homework help videos are made by Prof. Sousa and he does a great job in breaking down concepts. The homework problems will have a video link to a very similar problem which you can follow along to solve yours. I did Calc 2 and 3 online using his program at PC, great experience.\n\nWhat I did to help me study was also enroll in the free Phoenix College MATH MOOCs available for anyone here: https://www.phoenixcollege.edu/degrees-certificates/mathematics/self-study-math-moocs\nIt was basically the same course but non-credit so I could redo homework problem sets to prepare for exams.",

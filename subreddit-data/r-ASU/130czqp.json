    "postText": "Hello. I wanted to say it on here cuz I\u2019m still in shock and just want people to be aware. Today around 10:30pm I was heading home from the shuttles in Tempe when a guy who look unstable started following me close from the shuttles. Before hand I saw he was hitting the Peking meters and still kept my distance. I had to pass him and noticed he changed his shift onto me. I decided to sprint walk to get away from him but he still proceeded to walk the same pace as I was. Ngl my heart sank but I still keep walking faster and faster until eventually he was far away. He started yelling or something but I still kept walking fast until eventually I reach the Honors dorm I believe. I\u2019m currently safe in my apartment and I\u2019m still shaken up by the whole situation. I know I can call asu police but right now I have extreme anxiety and all over the place. If you see this guy screaming and hitting random meters please stay as far away as possible. I don\u2019t even know if he had a knife with him and thank god I didn\u2019t stick around to find out.",

It\u2019s basically the ASUPD non-emergency number except you type your tip/info/report/non-emergency assistance need.

I did pretty meh on this last exam, but when I input the another grade for the final to see what I could get, I realized I need a higher score now to pass. \nSemester just been getting to me especially this past two weeks and this one class I barely put any effort in and really just want to pass so I don't have to adjust my summer and fall classes.",

They are pushing the homeless out of that area and housing value near downtown has skyrocketed. All the grime in that area is being replaced by gentrification. Speedway and Broadway pretty good right there. Grant is still fucked up but a 10 mile or so drive north is Oro Valley area, looking like North Scottsdale. Gun violence can happen anywhere. Has UofA had campus groping or rape incidence? Not even close to ASU numbers. ASU is huge and the crime reflects that. So, stay safe and always keep an eye out, especially in the parking lots. After 9;00pm? Hell yeah, it's still a party school for God's sake. \n\nI went to ASU but moved down to Tucson for work.",

Looks nice, but Tempe brings in people from all over the PHX area. I grew up in Tempe. The buildings are taller, the surrounding people on and off campus are all the same. La Victorio Locos about 3 miles east. South Scottsdale, about a mile away. Not saying other cities don't have this, they do and so does Tucson.\n\nA major problem now is property crime and business theft. The housing costs have left people with very much less per month, some not enough to eat, have to drop health insurance etc. Homelessness is becoming increasingly insane all around. Downtowns including Tucson have pushed them away. No more \"needles park\" its a dog park now.",

I'm staff and a woman, and I've been around at all times of day and night, and never felt in danger. (I've lived in tons of cities and been to even more sketchy cities alone). I live in Tempe, too, and the campus is a bit safer than the regular parts of the city, but the whole city seems good. The ASU police are on the whole pretty good about keeping an eye on things and do patrols at all times. My daughter goes to school at Tempe, too. She's out at all hours of the night, and she's not very good at paying attention. But worst that ever happens is some drunk guy will try to pick her up and act slightly inappropriately. She's always been able to get help or find a safe place like a store or whatever to get rid of them. Yes, bikes, scooters, and anything left unattended will be stolen. But, plan your routes and don't isolate yourself. Be cognizant of your surroundings, and it's safer on campus than many other campuses, IMO.",

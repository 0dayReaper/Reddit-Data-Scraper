The new version is here:\n\nhttps://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/shop-all/best-sellers-c829812/womens-recon-backpack-pNF0A52SU?color=EP4&amp;size=OS\n\nThe way the women's backpack straps are done are the most comfortable due to having breasts.  And the extra straps and stabilization are great when you have to carry your electronics on top of books and whatever else.",

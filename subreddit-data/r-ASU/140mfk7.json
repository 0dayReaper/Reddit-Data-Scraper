    "postText": "Let's start with the fact that school books cost way too much. As my mom said last night \"it's a racket\". I have taken online courses prior for my whole associate degree outside of ASU and never paid for books. They were embedded as part of the class. Now I am in the online program here and apparently, I have to now buy books. My question for you all... what is the least expensive you have found for books for online courses. Obviously, any free sites would be awesome but any luck for you all?  Thank you in advance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the suggestions. These are great resources for my ongoing schooling. ",

But the psychology books for my minor could be as high as $250 each. \n\nWhile in grad school at ASU, the lowest paid per class was $0 since the course used free online resources or another course was able to get the book put electronically into the library for student use. The highest amount I paid for books for a single course in grad school (education related) was $230.",

            "comment": "Your mom is correct, it absolutely is a racket. A textbook that costs $200 here typically costs under $50 in Europe for the same edition. Why the difference? Somebody from a publisher basically said something like, \"Europeans just won't pay that much for textbooks, but Americans will.\" That's it, that's the whole reason.\n\nIf you can find a European version to buy, it could be cheaper even with shipping costs. Last I had checked, buying these books was considered legal due to grey market laws, so you should be fine. Now, that doesn't mean ASU wasn't paid off to make it against some made-up ethical code to purchase these books, so you might want to look into that first.\n\nFinally, I have had success purchasing textbooks from thriftbooks. My $120 textbook was only $10. Cover was pretty beat up, but the pages were all there and in good condition. Also, I think the prior owner owned a cat or something because I would sneeze up a storm every time I read from that book. But otherwise, solid purchase.",

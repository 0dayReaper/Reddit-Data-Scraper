    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nI'll be attending ASU in the Fall fulltime. I already have 12units and am pretty much on campus all day Tu/Th.\n\nI was accepted as a research assistant (RA) to a lab with ASU and wanted to find out, is there a way to obtain credit hours for the hours spent as an RA? The lab requires me to put in at minimum 9hrs a week, and between classes, work, and general life responsibilities, I was curious if I might be able to drop a class and supplement the credit hours for full time status with the hours spent as an RA.\n\nAny advice is appreciated =)",

In the College of Health Solutions, most often undergrad RAs are enrolled in academic credit and do not get a stipend. But there\u2019s also a different type of RA that graduate students can be that puts them in as a \u201cfunded student\u201d, meaning they get a stipend, benefits, etc.",

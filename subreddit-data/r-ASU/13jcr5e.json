I also added chem e as a concurrent second semester so I have to take FSE 100 too still (I still don't know if I'm gonna do it third or fourth semester). I think it's a project-based engineering course where you work on a project with a group and learn fundamental engineering skills. 2 credit hours.",

My class made a car from this lego kit that could pick up a person in a wheelchair (tiny cardboard model) and drive by itself through a maze. \n\nBtw: you\u2019ll also need to take both Phy 121 and Phy 131.  And I would highly recommend calling the BME advising office. You have to attend a webinar before you can meet a BME advisor to talk about switching majors. (Edit: and when you meet an advisor they\u2019ll talk about the classes you still need.) There\u2019s a webinar on the 24th and one in June. I know this cuz I too am switching to BME",

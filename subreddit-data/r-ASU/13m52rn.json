    "postText": "Hey, I am an International sophomore student and since last Fall I am applying for On-campus jobs but have still not been able to get any. I really need a job for Fall 2023 as I am struggling financially. Is anyone currently hiring for Fall 2023? Also if you know there is an opening or can refer me to a job it would help a lot.",

A few of them have some very detailed answers from those people who hire many student workers every semester. The key is to have a well-formatted and easy to read cover letter and resume. Also, tailor your cover letter and resume to the job you are applying to. There's nothing that turns a hiring manager off more than generic cover letters.",

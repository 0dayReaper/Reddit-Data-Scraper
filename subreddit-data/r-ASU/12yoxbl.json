At the Maricopa Colleges MAT 220 or 221 satisfies the MAT265 credit at asu. James Sousa's lessons and homework are some of the best out there. The homework problems have a video link which goes a similar example so you can work alongside the video. \n\nAlso check our James Sousa's free Self-Study courses available to everyone here: https://www.phoenixcollege.edu/degrees-certificates/mathematics/self-study-math-moocs",

We sat outside at the most dirtiest spots, leave blowers were doing their job, and cars kept honking. Met at work but we both went to ASU. Dude said that he liked me because I\u2019m his ideal type which is shy and innocent and then proceeds to talk about himself. I kindly got up and never again.",

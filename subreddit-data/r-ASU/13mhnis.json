    "postText": "Long story short , I have a low gpa from highschool and graduated in 2020. I have since just been working full time and have only had 2 academic comeback attempts. This time around its going pretty good and I have 12 credits coming in this semester with all As. If my gpa was 1.8 in highschool and apply with only 12 credits from CC will I be accepted based on my good semester ? Sorry if this is a dumb question",

Because the website states \u201cif you have 12 or more post highschool credits you  are considered a transfer\u201d. Would my gpa of the 12 credits and improvement in grades be enough or would I have to get 24 no matter what. Thank you for the reply",

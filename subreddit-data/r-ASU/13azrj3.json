            "comment": "I\u2019m gonna be a senior BDA major. I can\u2019t speak for CIS, but BDA is in the business school and you take all of the normal business courses like ECN, ACC, FIN, etc. There are 8 \u201cmajor\u201d classes you must take. the numbers may have changed over the years, and this is just the order I took them in to give you a feel of what I thought the classes classes were like. \n\nCIS 235 : intro to SQL and very basic python with a focus on just learning the main ideas of working with others in a team, importance of info security, etc. \n\nCIS 315 : analysis techniques using mainly excel, sometimes other software but no programming/coding. It\u2019s not too mathy, just about knowing how to press the right buttons with the right cells and interpret the output you get. \n\nCIS 365 : focus on databases and SQL. How to draw a database diagram given business needs, how to create the databases, and how to write SQL to manipulate database to get the info you need. \n\nCIS 355 : just a lecture class about data warehouses, which are basically just arrangements of databases on a large scale. There isn\u2019t any hands on coding work, more just about how data handling works in the business context.\n\nCIS 325 : this class is your \u201ccoding\u201d class. It gives you all of the ins and outs of python. This class was overwhelming for me because it felt like there was too much to learn to study effectively, but this is generally a class that people struggle with. You learn a lot, for me it was mostly how to troubleshoot using stack exchange lol\n\nCIS 375 : this class is about data mining. You use your python knowledge to make models. These models goals are (mainly) to predict something in the future. This class seemed difficult at first but you mainly copy-paste a model into python and tweak it as you need, would not consider it \u201ccoding\u201d even though you do use python.\n\nAs for CIS 415 and 450, I haven\u2019t taken those yet but I will next year and from what I\u2019ve heard 415 isn\u2019t difficult and 450 is a wrap up class. I don\u2019t think this major is too coding heavy, as I\u2019ve only had 2 classes use python and 2 more used SQL. You can easily stack these classes on top of eachother and I wouldn\u2019t consider the course load to be too much. I would NOT consider myself a coding genius by any means and I am still doing very well and enjoy every class :)\n\nI hope this helped! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.",

They are definitely not math classes, but you will have to interpret numbers from math that the computer did for you (ex. \u201cwhat does a coefficient of 3.76 mean? What number tells you how accurate this model is?\u201d Etc). I did have to take MAT210 and 211 for the basic WP Carey major requirements, and it looks like as a marketing major you will have to take those classes anyways regardless of the switch :)",

The whole point of CIS is to learn how to solve complex business problems with software that one may have to develop and integrate into other systems. Business data analytics means using software tools to mine large sets of unstructured data to perform statistical modeling, qualitative analysis, or predictive modeling. You'll learn how to gather, cleanse, and present data. If none of that sounds fun, you're gonna have a bad time...",

There are a few classes with some tricky coding, but it is definitely not a programming degree. If you like statistics, you'll enjoy analytics. Even if you don't like stats or math in general data jobs are so broad you will probably find something you like that isn't mathy.",

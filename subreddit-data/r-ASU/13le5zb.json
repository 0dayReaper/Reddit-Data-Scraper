According to a lot of people in the chat, they\u2019re basically done with all the assignments. Each module consists of lot of reading, watching videos, quizzes and exercises via CogBooks. Then there are also exit quizzes at the end of each module. \n\nIt\u2019s only day 5 of week 1. How the heck are these people going through everything so quickly? I asked them if they\u2019re actually taking the time to read and understand, and they said they are. \n\nI spent this whole day working on a single module and I\u2019m not even done with it. What are they doing that I\u2019m not?",

If that doesn\u2019t work, try looking for real-life examples. For instance, if you\u2019re learning about a disease, try finding an article on someone who has it, or even better if you know someone who might have it.\n\nTextbooks suck in the sense that you don\u2019t have someone going over it, they know what parts to skip over and which parts to highlight. But they\u2019re great in learning as much as possible on the subject. It\u2019s very valuable that you\u2019re doing the readings, and in the end will put you further ahead of those who put videos on 2x speed and just do that.\n\nAlso if you do have a Discord of the class, feel free to ask questions there! I promise there\u2019s no dumb questions, I personally like it for the sense that even if it feels like a dumb question, I can just remember that because it\u2019s online and mostly anonymous, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll ever meet most if not any of those people IRL, so idgaf what they might think about me. Plus, it\u2019ll help them because explaining to another person is one of the best ways to ensure you understand yourself (look up the Feynman technique if you wanna learn more on that) so it\u2019s worth for everyone involved.\n\nAt the end of the day, you learn differently than everyone else! Don\u2019t be discouraged by that, that\u2019s what makes you you! Learning how to learn is the biggest challenge in the first year, so if it\u2019s hard right now, that\u2019s why. Take time to understand yourself and how you learn a subject and you\u2019ll go way further than the people who are seemingly doing better now but don\u2019t understand themselves; they\u2019re going to hit this exact roadblock in 300-level classes and there it\u2019s gonna SUCK. Just know that you\u2019ve got this!",

    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I am doubtful about EEE 352, although the professor has very good reviews, I am worried about the workload. I can switch EEE 352 for my history credit \\(ROM 101 \\[easy A\\]\\). But If I take 352 this semester that will allow me to take dope photovoltaic classes next semester. Could any EE majors give me any insight? Thanks! ](https://preview.redd.it/5xrzgz6h1u5b1.png?width=2717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e4ae8552cd6af37fc31326ef4dc00ffdd42ecd91)\n\nP.S I will also be interning from home around 10-15 hours a week. It is not an hard job.",

            "comment": "203 should be pretty \"easy\", I had that same professor and he made the class extremely straightforward (consistent HWs, tests that he prepares you for). \n\n334 can be a tough class if you don't stick with it, pay attention (and actually do the HW problems) and it shouldn't trouble you too much. The labs can be time consuming though. \n\n352 hybrid (online) was one of my tougher classes, but I had a different professor. Zhang is highly rated so I wouldn't sweat that class too much. \n\n343 is also pretty simple, I had a different prof. but you'll likely figure it is an easier class than your EEE classes. \n\nOverall I'd say go for it, Junior year in EE is IMO the toughest year and the year you want to get as much done as possible. 352 shouldn't burden you too much, and opens up some really cool 400 level classes.",

He really stimulates the students to join the lecture to answer questions. The labs aren't too bad especially if you get a good partner, but since this will probably be the first open lab you have, you really need to discipline yourself to plan times to go into the lab that are not the same day the lab is due.\n\n203 is just a math class and is fairly easy to get through with a bit of effort. Not the easiest concepts in the world to grasp but definitely a very important class as without Fourier series , electrical engineering wouldn't exist\n\n343 for some people is a wake up slap. Up to this point you have only ever climbed the ladder of calculus that ends at differential equations for engineers. But linear alg is a totally different beast but if you can get used to the different type of math you'll be good.\n\n352 was my favorite pathway I have ever taken and even inspired me to do a masters in physical electronics and photonics. Also I would recommend sticking with 352 because of the sheer amount of technical electives that it allows you to take. The earlier you take 352 the more chances you will have to take the super dope tech electives like 465, probably one of my favorite classes I've ever taken.",

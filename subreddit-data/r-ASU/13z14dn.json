    "postText": "Hi brand new student to ASU. I\u2019m in my first course right now, BIO 181. It\u2019s a gosh darn nightmare. TAs and the professor are very unhelpful! There\u2019s no book to follow along with just videos from some other prof which are obviously out of date for this course as we\u2019ve been told to ignore several things. There are mistakes on the assignments and were supposed to intuitively know to calculate for something else. For example use the median instead of the mean like the problem says, some of these issues are addressed in office hours but now everyone can go to those. What the hell is up with this? Is this a real accredited university? There\u2019s no rhyme or reason the rules change assignment to assignment and there is no way to know they changed until you turn it in and wait several days to know if you got it wrong. One assignment were supposed to use rounded numbers in calculation but the current assignment were not and the only reason most of us know, after we submitted it of course, is because a kind student went to the office hours and specifically asked. \n\nI\u2019m honestly pissed because I\u2019m going into debt for this. I already have a degree and I\u2019ve never experienced such chaos in a course! Is this how bio classes always are? Is this how going online always is? I did most of my previous degree online at a state school in Missouri and it was honestly awesome. I haven\u2019t learned a single thing in this course and I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s too late to drop and get money back. We have an exam Monday. Please help!",

            "comment": "BIO 181 was one of the harder and more time consuming classes I\u2019ve taken at ASU online. I passed with an A but had to watch the lectures about three times each with extremely active note taking. Every class at ASU is different. You jumped right in with one of the harder classes, even though its a \u2018100 level class\u2019. You can get through this if you write down every topic, make flashcards, watch the lectures several times and memorize key processes. I highly recommend dedicating a few hours each day on studying the material until you get a handle on how the exams will present. Some classes will have mistakes in the content as you\u2019ve pointed out, but those micro scenarios typically won\u2019t impact the macro for you if you\u2019re really leaning in. ASU is a great school. In my experience - it took a couple of sessions for me to start to understand the flow. I repeat\u2026 flashcards. If you want an A in BIO 181, you should end the semester with a stack of several hundred. Many of which will have several bullet items on the flip side.",

Made quizzes easy. Requires a free account.\n\n\\- Playing around on the *Grades* page seeing what my grade would be if I aced or bombed this or that.\n\n\\- Having the page of *Excel tutorial videos* handy to help make quick frequency bar-chart histograms and all that.\n\n\\- Going over the graded assignments to see the reasoning for the correct answers.\n\nI have most of the above open in different tabs, and use a Chrome extension called 'Session Alive' that manages to keep the pages from being logged out of, and try not to close that window, and have the browser set to open the previous session if the window closes.\n\nI was as frustrated as you (redundant, conflicting, and outdated answering and submission guidelines; outdated lectures), but I feel way more at ease now.",

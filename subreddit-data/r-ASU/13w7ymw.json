To start a club you need one faculty advisor and three officers and will need to submit the clubs constitution. Depending on the club's focus, the faculty advisor is probably going to be the most difficult part to the puzzle. If you don't have any faculty in mind, then work on finding officers the maybe do know faculty that would be keen. The constitution part is pretty easy, as there's templates and whatnot you can use. \n\nsource: former faculty advisor",

    "postText": "I am an incoming student in the class of 2027 at ASU majoring in civil engineering. I got into Barrett but I see a lot of people say it isn't worth it for engineering. I was wondering why this was. When I visited, they said that employers going to Fulton look at Barrett students before the other students. Does anyone know if this is true? Thanks in advance.",

Take that money and build up a portfolio of projects, that will be infinitely more impressive than Barrett.\n\nApart from lower division classes, there aren't any Barrett upper division classes(clarification: for major specific classes), so the best way to make connections with other ambitious people is to join clubs.",

Just being in Barrett is not gonna automatically get you a job, but Barrett students are typically more likely to be involved in research (Barrett Thesis), pursue internships, participate in extracurricular projects and clubs, etc. If all you have to show to employers are your grades then a Barrett honors acknowledgement on your degree may give you more consideration to someone with similar GPA and no honors. Getting internships, networking with companies (many engineering clubs hold networking events with industry partners), and getting other practical experience will make you a more desired candidate. If all you're doing is coursework and nothing else you're gonna have a harder time looking for employment.",

If you want to go further in academics I would consider it, but if you\u2019re going for industry, spend time on connections and on school rather than the extra workload. Engineering will get rough and having the extra projects and extra fees will hit harder and harder as time goes on. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely a \u201cyou get what you put into it\u201d deal.",

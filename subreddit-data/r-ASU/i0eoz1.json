            "comment": "I honestly believe after they collect tuition (and dorm rent lmao) we will go fully online. I work at a science lab on campus and over \n2 months  ago i attended a zoom back to work orientation (I\u2019m just an undergrad researcher-lest sem Sr- at A research lab on campus) and that was like two months ago. It was basically like a \u201chere\u2019s how classes are going to run\u201d and it was a bunch of research professors in the zoom chat kinda asking questions about everything we were being told- also apparently i want the only one who thought it was about laboratory workers returning to work- not lecturers and how classes would work. However: To be fair- they did listen to what i saw the professors typing. For example- at this \u201cback to work training (which mind you was ONLY AFE to have via zoom?) the ASU plan for semester was for every other seat to be open (mandatory) and classes would be capped at 1/2 the usual capacity, to \u201cadhere to social distancing\u201d. I explicitly remember one person (I\u2019m assuming a prof) typing in zoom chat \u201cin what lecture hall do you think the seats are six feet wide\u201d in reference to the ppt slide saying \u201cevery other seat will be left open with professor enforcement to maintain social distancing guidelines\u201d. My biggest takeaway is that: if there has to be all these guidelines and specifics and regulations that a portion of the population undoubtedly purposely ignore- why can\u2019t we just admit that it\u2019s not safe to have students on campus? I get the feeling that my research prof (2 PhD\u2019s in cancer related fields, the man is a genuine and my idol) doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s safe as he called people \u201cidiots\u201d for sending more than 1 member of their household to go get groceries. Dr Crow bragged about investing millions (might be been \u201ctens\u201d or \u201chundreds\u201d of millions- it was on local news idr tho)  into equipping tempe asu lecture halls with \u201cenhanced streaming, video, and internet capacity in preparation for the implementation of ASUSync this upcoming semester.\u201d So i honestly think this is just a money grab to help compensate for the fact that ASU has a legit pumped millions and millions of dollars to allow everyone to have the best experience possible with online learning.

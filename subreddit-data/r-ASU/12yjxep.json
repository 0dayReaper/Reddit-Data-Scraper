    "postText": "Hello, I'm considering enrollment and only have a GED. ASU Pathway for Engineering Management lists 8 courses with 24 credits. Would passing them gain admission into the program? Also, how many courses can one do concurrently and can one do them out of order listed in term program.\n\nMajor Map - [https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/major-map/ASU00/ESEMGBSE/null/ONLINE/2023](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/major-map/ASU00/ESEMGBSE/null/ONLINE/2023)\n\nAlso there  are 8 courses listed which are necessary to be taken. Besides those 8 -  I'm considering more that seem to be available that are for this program  - hist100, psy101, hist109, cee181. I have two questions.\n\n1. Is there a limit on how many courses I can take from the online universal learning that will transfer into the program.\n2. Is  there any resource that lists out the courses in this program that line  up in the universal learning, currently I am manually searching.\n\nmy goal is to take as many courses before enrolling into the program.\n\nthank you",

    "postText": "So initially when I applied to ASU it was as a degree seeking student, when I didn't know that a visiting university student is a thing and that is actually what I am. So I asked them what I can do to change my status. They said withdraw the degree-seeking application and put in a non-degree seeking application. So I did that and then I asked for them to withdraw the degree seeking application but instead  they withdrew my non-degree seeking application. So I called and they said to ask for it to get reinstated and to ask them to withdraw the correct application. I get an email saying it should reflect the correct thing now. And it did. For one day. So I call for an update and to see what is going on and it turns out they withdrew BOTH applications. So I again asked them to reinstate the non-degree seeking application and here we are a month later and again for one day it said I was a visiting university student and then disappeared. I am really nervous as classes start on Monday and with it saying that I'm degree-seeking and with me being registered for classes without prerequisites, I'm going to be dropped from the classes. And one of the classes if I'm dropped I can't get back in because it's an entirely full class. Can someone PLEASE tell me if I'm able to do something other than do this back and forth thing with admissions before it is too late??",

            "comment": "I can\u2019t speak to your situation exactly, but I had issues getting the proper admission (I was trying to do spring semester as non-degree seeking, as I start a degree program in the fall). I\u2019m fairly certain you will not get forced out of the classes you are currently registered for. Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in. However, if there are other administrative issues like financial aid that you need to figure out, I\u2019d call the admissions line, explain the situation again (I\u2019m sure you already have), and ask for it to be escalated to a manager or senior admissions advisor. They may sit on their hands for a few days and class may even start, but the other issues are okay to linger more so than class start. Tl;dr is you should be fine for classes. Escalate the issues with admissions and make sure you communicate through email and over the phone so that there\u2019s proper tracking and you get out of the redirect loop.",

    "postText": "I'm a Criminology and Criminal Justice major and have about 45 units/hours to go. I'm currently attending ASU in-person, but I just got a full time job and have been thinking of switching to ASU Online. I have heard that the online courses are accelerated so I was wondering if it's doable to work full time while also doing full time Online (which correct me if I'm wrong I heard it's 2 A &amp; 2 B)? \n\nI was also wonder what's the most challenging aspects of ASU Online (and if you work, what are the challenges of working &amp; attending school full time)? \n\nAre the professors helpful?\n\nAlso does ASU Online use lockdown browser or a program similar to it? In-person professors utilities this program but only 1 professor requires the webcam to be on. \n\nAnd does anyone know if it's a difficult process to switch from an in-person student to an online student??\n\nLastly I would gladly appreciate any helpful tips, so if I do switch I can make the most of the courses and be successful.",

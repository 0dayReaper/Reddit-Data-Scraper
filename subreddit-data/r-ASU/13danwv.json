    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nI got an email from my Barrett Engineering peer academic leader this past January saying that Barrett students have access to LinkedIn Learning courses for free. However, the two links that were provided both led to a \"Page not Found\" screen. I tried finding this by myself on Barrett's website but to no avail. These were the two links given in the email:\n\n[https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/linkedin-learning](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/academics/linkedin-learning)  \n[https://barretthonors.asu.edu/sso/linkedinlearning](https://barretthonors.asu.edu/sso/linkedinlearning) \n\nDoes anyone have any information on where I could get access or if Barrett still gives this perk? I'm not sure who to email about this since I believe a new peer academic leader was hired and I'm not sure if my Barrett Advisor would know. Thanks!  :)",

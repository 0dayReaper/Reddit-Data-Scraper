There are in-class engagement activities that she randomly opens in some classes and for that, you need to be there. Three exams, I didn't study for any and I passed with a C and I am happy. Honestly, she ain't the greatest prof. Her tests are okay I mean if you study you will pass with a B at least. I would still choose a better Prof.",

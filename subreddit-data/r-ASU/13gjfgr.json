    "postText": "Hello, I'm the primary GM of a little online table top RPG gaming group that's looking to expand its ranks. We mostly play anything from Pathfinder 1E but right now we are Playing Testing a new system called Beach Episode. As the name implies it's an anime themed system. We typically play Wednesdays from 7pm to 10pm Arizona Time. We're mostly Sun Devil Alumni and have been together for a fair few years now. Since we are playtesting / developing a new system we are prioritizing females since it's we're seeing a lot of interest from that demographic oddly (Anime is for everyone go figure). We're all good folk but like our stories to hit those feels once in a while and do not shy away from tasteful use of dark topics. I will also add we will provide all the rulebooks and such so you don't need to run out and buy a new system. \n\nIf you are interested please message me with the following questions answered.\n\nName we will call you\nLocation (State, City that kind of jazz, just need to know what region and time zones we're talking)\nExperienced or Unexperienced and with what systems. (If your Unexperienced all the better I like teaching and we can corrupt you that much quicker.)\nDo you like anime (The more weeby the more you'll like us)\nA little about yourself. We're all friends and we'd like you to be one too. If your socially awkward, perfect, join the club, we make the jackets. Chances are we'll hit you up outside the game to chat as we get more comfortable with you so don't expect just to see us during game time.",

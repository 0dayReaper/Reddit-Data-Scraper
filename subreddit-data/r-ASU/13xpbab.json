    "postText": "I dunno if it's because I'm stupid or if it's because I'm not on my ADHD meds or what, but I'm having a really tough time with GLG104. I took 102 last semester, so I just have this one lab left, and I'm taking it as an iCourse with Johnson.\n\nI've read the syllabus multiple times, I have the textbook, I'm looking at the worksheets and the instructions and everything, but nothing makes sense. Like, I go in the quizzes and have 0 clue what to do. Not to mention, doing an A-Session while working and balancing other life stuff is difficult in my opinion. \n\nI'm honestly considering dropping it and just taking it as a C-session later, but I had already planned to take a different science next semester so I'd have to wait until spring. Ugh.",

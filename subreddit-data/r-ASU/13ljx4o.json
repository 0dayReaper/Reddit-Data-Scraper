It\u2019s my first post on Reddit, and English is not my first language, so sorry if I broke any sub rules or made anyone feel offended. Don\u2019t know if this kind of post is appropriate here but I saw other similar post on this sub and just really want to know my chances of admission.\n\nJunior Asian immigrant female (been in Arizona for 5 years) here trying to apply to asu next year. I went to an instate high school, but messed up freshmen and sophomore year because of Covid(family pressure and language barrier). In Junior year I tried to raise my gpa by taking more AP and honors but it only ended up overloading my self and now I have a cumulative unweighted gpa of 2.7.\n\nI haven\u2019t done the sat yet(taking it this august), but I got a 1300 on the psat and a 30 on the act. For extracurricular, I do have club activities but I never got a position in any of those clubs. I don\u2019t work at all but I am TAing for my AP biology teacher next year. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that ASU accepts almost anyone but still feel unsafe because of my mega low unweighted gpa. Would I be Okay applying next year?:(\n\nThanks again for anyone reading or answering \ud83e\udd7a",

It says on there that they auto-accept anyone with the stats on their website.\n\nAlso, if you are planning on going into STEM, you need to be prepared to work harder because it is harder than anything you have done in high school. The pressure in general and to do well on exams is massively higher than that of high school. You are taking essentially all AP courses but harder in many cases. If you cannot handle your high school classes, then take senior year to really learn how to handle the pressure. \n\nI don\u2019t know you obviously and you certainly can do well, just understand that this is going to be way harder than what you think and been difficult thus far, so prepare yourself.",

The workload was truly overwhelming for me especially in the AP testing weeks, but I think my time management skills did improve over time and did sign up for 5 AP classes next year to get use to the college schedule. :) thank you for the advice!!!

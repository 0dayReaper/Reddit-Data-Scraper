    "postText": "I had an abusive family growing up, cue police, cue cps, yada, yada, yada. It was bad. I don't have contact with any of them at all anymore, and I am an incoming freshman this fall 2023. Due to my situation, I was offered roughly an $8,000 Parent PLUS loan. It seems I can not reject this offer without adding a parent to my account. Who can I contact to let them know I am in no form of contact from my prior family, am doing this entirely alone, and that I need to reject that Parent PLUS loan myself?",

I believe you can get alternative federal loans to parent plus if you\u2019re an independent. You should call them and ask if you can change your status given your situation. If they say no, you should ask what can be done about the parent plus loan. Make sure you\u2019re talking to the right person.",

            "comment": "1) Regarding the Parent Plus loan, you can just ignore it- it will sit there and not cause any issues. Your bigger challenge will be getting established as an independent student before January, when next year's FAFSA is due. And getting a no contact order on your ASU records so the University doesn't inadvertently release information you don't want released - like your dorm assignment or schedule.\n\n1) Call or email the Dean of Students office for your campus. They're super helpful and should be able to direct you to the right place to make sure your no contact orders are reflected in your records. \nhttps://eoss.asu.edu/dos\n\n\n2) Call the financial aid office and ask how to start the process of declaring yourself independent for the 2023/24 FAFSA. I believe that documentation of no contact orders is usually very helpful but they should have more info. 1-855-278-5080\n\n3) Call the EMPACT line to ask if there are other campus resources you should be aware of. EMPACT is ASU\u2019s dedicated 24-hour crisis line that\u2019s available outside of normal business hours and on holidays and weekends. Although EMPACT is intended for crisis support, you don\u2019t necessarily have to be in crisis to call. You may just need guidance on how to handle a concern about a student or friend or need a helpful resource. EMPACT is staffed by highly qualified, helpful professionals that are there to help, call 480-921-1006.\n\n4) At the start of fall term call the ASU clinic and get an appointment with a counselor. Share the history, including the no contact orders, and see if they have any other recommendations",

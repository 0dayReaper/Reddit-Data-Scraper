            "comment": "For the 4+1 program I had considered, the way it works is you take a couple of graduate level classes during your last semester as an undergraduate. Then you graduate with your bachelor's and continue your graduate courses to receive your masters. The type of aid I receive is a mix of employer benefits, scholarships, and Pell grants so they would cover the graduate classes I take as an undergraduate. Once you receive your bachelor's, then the aid for the remaining graduate classes will change. For example, if the aid is specific to obtaining a bachelor's degree that aid will most likely end and not cover the 1 year of masters. On the plus side, you got like 1/3 of a masters degree paid for!",

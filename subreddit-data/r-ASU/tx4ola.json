Just don't take away someone's sleep because of it. On a similar note, everyone does masturbation for themselves, but nobody should be doing it the way my old roommate did: loudly and at 3am. In the same room as me.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is if it's okay in your mind for someone to be revving an overly loud engine outside apartment complexes in the middle of the night (weekday or otherwise), then you must also be okay with some guy loudly beating his meat in your bedroom in the middle of the night while you're there. Both hypothetical people are doing it for themselves, bro.",

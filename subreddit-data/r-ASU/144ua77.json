I have had Dell Latitudes (and supported them forever, they are not gaming machines, but will do your class work perfectly).\n\nIf you are the least but mechanically inclined, upgrading the storage (call it hard drive/SSD etc) and RAM is pretty easy.\n\nA 1TB SSD is ideal, Matlab and other software packages are huge.  2TB isn't a bad idea if it won't break the bank.\n\n16GB RAM should be the minimum memory.\n\nTowards the end of your second year, plan on buying a nicer new system to complete your last two years.",

But if you want the best bang for your buck go for an M1 MacBook Air. You may need to make some adjustments for some software but you should be fine. Engineering professors usually plan their projects and assignments for both MacOS and Windows users. But if you're looking for a windows machine and Mac isn't your thing, you can always go for a Dell XPS, I know the XPS 15 comes with a 3050, if you really need the gpu.",

Having that more power a gaming laptop has over a workspace oriented laptop will go a long way. Plus it doubles as a gaming machine (if you want to game). They tend to be bulky and loud though. So that might be a factor for you to keep in mind.",

If you can find it out of box at Best Buy, you can get it for a steal of $1,300 and I\u2019ve owned it for a year. It holds up for me insanely well as I do video/audio editing plus gaming on my free time. Id say look into that they probably have upgraded the internals and definitely look at Best Buy for any potential sales.",

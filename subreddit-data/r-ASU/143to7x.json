Has anyone on here ever given a speech at graduation? If so, what did you do to receive that opportunity? Was it a difficult journey? Thank you!",

            "comment": "I spoke at a special interest convocation and attended a few more ceremonies with varying degrees of responsibility/recognition. I think the main ways to speak at a graduation ceremony is to either have very high-profile accomplishments or to sign up for a special interest convocation and submit a speech when they ask for speech submissions. It's easier if you already have a stronger bond to the community that the special interest ceremony represents, like participating in events and activities ahead of your senior year and having a leadership position in a club related to that community. These experiences provide a unique understanding of the community for a speech",

I had to practice a bunch of times in front of different directors just so they can give me pointers and how to relax while doing the speech. Still my biggest audience for a speech to date as it was in GCU's basketball stadium. Would not recommend unless you are a freak and like being in front of thousands of people. No matter how comfortable you are with yourself, it's still nerve wrecking. Good luck though!",

I submitted one and I was selected, though the dean of the college requested some edits.  This was many moons ago so I have no idea if it's still done that way.",

In college, you have to be chosen as either an impact award or outstanding graduate (at least in Fulton) and from that subset one of them will be chosen to give a speech. Based on a background that faculty think will provide a valuable outlook/speech from.",

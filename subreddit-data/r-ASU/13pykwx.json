It\u2019s expecting too much to think that we know things about every program in existence. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do at ASU for CS and ways to leverage your experience in Barrett. If you are unsure about transferring and want to get more out of your experience at ASU, then this would be the subreddit to post to. \n\nIf you know you want to transfer out and have a university/ program in mind, you need to research that on your own and look for a subreddit related to that institution.",

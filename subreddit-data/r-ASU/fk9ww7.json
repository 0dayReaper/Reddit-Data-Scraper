Instead, I can stay home, fall asleep during lecture videos and pick up where I left off, stay in PJs, and deal with no people. It's been a dream come true :P",

I can focus and concentrate so much better when not under the glare of floursent lighting, the pressure and anxiety rolling off of my peers, designated at a specific time. Online classes are the best!",

You need to explain what went wrong the 2X you failed and how you\u2019re going to not do those things and do better more useful things to pass this time.  These might include getting a tutor, joining TRIO, getting SAILS accommodations, working less hours at your paying job, getting a study group, taking less credit hours, taking a MOOC over the summer to brush up, and so forth.",

I emailed my petition to repeat a class for a third time at the beginning of May and every time I email them to check on the progress they tell me that based on the progression list it's with the Advising Director for review and I should hear back within a week or two. Hopefully, they will give me their decision before June 29th so I can enroll in the course.",

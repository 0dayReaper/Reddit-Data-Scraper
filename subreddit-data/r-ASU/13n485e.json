I also have a full-time internship. \n\nIs this going to be too much? I know this will depend on the person, but if anyone has done something similar I\u2019d love to hear your experience.",

            "comment": "My experience with ECE102 was pretty easy. It was project based with not too many assignments. It does depend on the professor and possibly the college you're taking it at. I learned a bit of MATLAB and circuits in my ECE102 and other who took it with other profs or at other colleges learned other things. I took it at Phoenix College but the prof is at another college now. I will say, it's probably easier to just take FSE100 at ASU if you're taking classes at both. It's one semester instead of two.",

I don't think I can give out code details about the assignments because of academic honesty and stuff but yes, the assignments have long specifications, take a lot of time, and you start completely from scratch.\n\nHe gives about a week per assignment and although I got near 100% in the assignment category, I used up the entire week each time because it simply just took so long to fix all of the autograder test cases. I recommend joining the discord because that was super super helpful to me (you can talk to TAs and other students there). Also the last assignment was wild, shit took me the entire week + 3 TA office hours + 6 hours of debugging on the last day, and soooo many students were asking for help in the discord during that week.\n\nI had a really shitty prof (extremely easy) for 205 last semester so I was not used to Selgrad level of projects. However, I do feel like a much better programmer after 240. Not trying to scare you with these descriptions, just giving you a point of view from an average programmer.",

So that's probably where you can put in less effort\n\nScheme we had an assignment on, and it was challenging but at the end I liked it because it really helped build my recursion skills.   \n\n\nAll the C/C++ code will be compiled on asu's linux servers, which Selgrad will fully teach how to do. So in addition to pointers, you can also get started with the basics of the linux command line environment with simple commands (such as mkdir, ls, and cd) and learn the very basics of how navigate vim or emacs",

            "comment": "The simple answer is yes because math often builds on previous concepts. Especially if it isn't daily use math (like accounting where is basically + - \u00f7 \u00d7).\n\nThe complex answer is **you do what you feel you can handle**.  If your class load is already difficult in a certain semester and math is hard for you to do and takes more effort/study, then fit the harder math with easier classes for you.\n\nEither way best of luck in your journey to obtaining your degree!",

Taking the classes consecutively is probably the best way. Consider this your warning, though. Whatever amount of effort takes to learn the algebra, it will require 4 times that to learn the calculus.",

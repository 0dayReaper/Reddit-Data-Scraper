However One of my classes professors(on campus) has atrocious reviews on RMP but his course is the only one that pops up for fall.  Is my only option to stick it out?\nThx y\u2019all \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

I've myself seen (in real time) a brigading of a prof's RMP because a handful of students got Fs who didn't attend or do assignments (and I know that because I was the TA). \n\nAnonymously written reviews do not tell anything about quality of instruction. Even my own are skewed positively, which I don't think are accurate. \n\nMy advice: pick class times that work with your schedule, and work hard. You'll have profs you'll like and some you don't -- that's a fact of life.",

Obviously some are just hate because of a students lack of accountability but if a teacher has below 3 stars and more than 20 reviews he/she probably fucking sucks. You\u2019re a professor obviously you want to believe that it\u2019s not always true and sure not ALWAYS but a pretty reliable indicator rather than none at all.",

Much like amazon, ignore the 5s and 1s, the middle ratings are the one's that matter. From there you need to disregard the dipshits and those with a grudge and see what the common threads are. \n\nEvery university is going to have shitty faculty, we're not all here for the same reasons, nor have the same abilities. Doing well in college is just as much about knowing what your professor is looking for as it is knowing the material for the course. In my opinion, that's the real takeaway from getting a degree.",

    "postText": "I'm graduating with my BA this May and I'm looking at the graduation info right now. I have a 3.48 cumulative GPA as of now, so that means I qualify for cum laude rightttt? In regards to that, how do you go about getting honors cords? The ASU website basically just gives a table for the gpa requirements and where that places you in honors, and then it says you get cords to wear but no info about how you get them lol. Am I just supposed to go to the University Registrar Services office and ask about it? I have already got my cap and gown and everything so I guess I'm just a bit confused. maybe I'm wrong and I'm not actually graduating with honors lol. any insight is appreciated, TIA!!",

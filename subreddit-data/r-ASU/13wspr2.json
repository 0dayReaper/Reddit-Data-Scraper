Once the Dean of Students found out from one of my professors, she coordinated with all of my professors to work with me.\n\nAlso, I ran into a situation where the one class I needed to graduate wasn't going to be available for 3 more semesters. I freaked out but after talking with my advisor and the head of my program, I was able to get an override to swap out one required class for another upper division class within my major. There should be other options to explore in a situation like this.\n\nGood luck!",

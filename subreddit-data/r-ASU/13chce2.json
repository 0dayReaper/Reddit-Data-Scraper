But through it all I realized that no matter how hard I was hit or knocked down, getting up, learning from your mistakes, and trying harder the next time (even if you're unsuccessful in your second attempt) is a form of success. You'll always deal with failure, sometimes continuously, but as long as you get up learn from it you'll continue to be successful.",

They don't seem to be affiliated with the university. Are they, or are they operated by some unrelated private company? Also, what purpose do they serve?",

Her nose was buried so far in her phone she probably burnt her nose hairs. I finally had to get her attention that she was parked in the middle of the road and had to move but she made it my fault somehow.",

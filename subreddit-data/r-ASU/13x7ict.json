    "postText": "To those who are in the Starbucks CAP, I have a question. I\u2019m already a student at ASU, and just recently discovered that Starbucks can do the tuition assistance thing. I was wondering if I were to apply and get hired, would I still qualify for the tuition assistance or is it only for the ones barely starting their academic careers? I really appreciate all your help. I don\u2019t know who else to ask \ud83d\ude14",

When I worked there, you needed to work about 20hrs/week to be eligible for benefits including ASU. \n\nGoogle Starbucks college achievement plan. You can talk to an advisor for the most updated info.",

So as long as you haven\u2019t completed an undergrad program, you can use SCAP for the remainder of your degree. It cannot be applied retroactively, and it is solely for online classes. If you\u2019re going in-person then you\u2019ll have to switch to online enrollment.\n\nETA: it takes 90 days to be eligible for bux benefits, with an average of 20hrs/week (so like ~250hrs total). If you get hired ASAP you could probably start using it for late fall sessions or spring 2024.",

Remember that CAP only covers you if you do the ASU Online program, not an on-campus one.  Check with a financial aid specialist before making decisions.",

I would suggest that you contact your local Starbucks and fill out the Get Info Form. Also, contact your success coach to see if they can provide you with information and your advisor.

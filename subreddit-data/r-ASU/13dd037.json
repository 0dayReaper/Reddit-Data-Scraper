    "postText": "Hello you all, basically there is a problem that I cannot register for the summer thesis continuation course right now, because I have two Holds on my ASU account. One is for the degree selection since I got accepted to the PhD program, and another one is for the financial guarantee form (which should be processing right now). My original plan is to graduate during the summer, and continue my PhD afterwards. Both holds will take 7-14 days to complete, even more during peak time, and I am worried that if I can register before the deadline of session A which is May 17th. Also my academic advisor is out of office until May 18th, so I am left alone to deal with this. I have contacted the program and seek advices, but you know, they respond extremely slow as well. Am I going to get delayed for my PhD as well as my master degrees?",

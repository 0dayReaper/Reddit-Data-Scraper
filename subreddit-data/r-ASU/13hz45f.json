    "postText": "So I requested a major change through my ASU Advisor from Cybersecurity (ASU West) to Software Engineering (Polytechnic Campus). She told me to read up on the differences between the 2 majors in the title so I\u2019m curious, in summary, what the differences are and say for example which one is harder &amp; which one would look better on paper. I\u2019m a noobie to all this so bare with me. Just wanna know what I\u2019d be expecting.\n\nThanks for the help :)",

In a professional setting, people remember you for misspellings like that. Don\u2019t want you to be that guy.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s pretty straightforward.\n\nComputer Science teaches theory, data structures, programming, code, etc.\n\nSoftware Engineering does so similarly, but with an applied approach, meaning that while teaching pretty much the same concepts and with overlapping courses, it does so with an emphasis on how they are actually used in industry and software engineering professions.\n\nSomebody may be really interested in the science of how to relate computers with data structures and algorithms. They push the boundaries of what computers can do. This would be a computer scientist. They study computers. \n\nOn the other hand, a software engineer does just what the title says. They engineer software. This means utilizing the understanding of computers, algorithms, data structures and code, to create software that accomplishes tasks. They do so within an engineering framework (hopefully). This means planning, organization, processes, and metrics that are applied to come up with a solution.\n\nOne example is agile methodology. It\u2019s a process in software engineering that many teams use to organize projects and goals and deliver a product. But a computer scientist wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to understand something like this.\n\nHopefully this is enough to help you have that aha moment.",

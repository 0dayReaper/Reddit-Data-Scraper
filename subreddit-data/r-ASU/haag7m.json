I get that that is a weird thing to care about but there is a Thai kickboxing club I'm interested in that normally meets there, and I expect it will be just one of many clubs that finds it difficult to meet.\n\nAdditionally, it sounds like the administration won't let students eat at the actual dining halls, and will instead encourage them to eat outside. Beyond being absurd and likely extremely uncomfortable on 80+ let alone 90+ degree days, I feel like that will make it harder to connect with my peers. \n\nLastly, the current plans are that every class on campus that is at all large will be split up into groups of students that alternate attending the class in-person. So at the end of the day, what does the 16k we have to pay for room and board get us other than 50% less online classes, extremely uncomfortable meals, and slightly more social engagement than we have at our homes.",

Sure the school has money, but that doesn't necessarily mean that in a time of huge costs they're going to save student jobs. Last semester we lost half a semester of gym access. So $12.5 Sure, on principle I'd like it back. But if I don't get my $12.5 back I'm not going to cry about it.\n\n4.)

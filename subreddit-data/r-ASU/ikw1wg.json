Your medical experience? No? That's right you disagree with him based on how you feel, but that's not how smart people work it's how dumbasses are controlled.  See I've spoken with Seager directly about COVID19 and I have 20 years as a clinical laboratory scientist. Hes not a denier of the disease, hes an opponent of fear and weakness. He works in his community every day outside of the views of the news papers that feed you your anger dopamine fix. Helping people with immune disorders become more resistant to illness. Why the fuck would he do that if he didnt believe in it? And btw you wouldn't need that social media rage boner dopamine hit if everyone would stop living like cowards and fucking socialize.  Just keep your mouths to yourselves and wash your fucking hands ffs. And if any of you have better than a science a degree and two decades of lab science experience and most of that as a technologist. You can have an opinion.  Because otherwise you're talking out your ass, you dont know, you feel, and that is the territory of fucking idiots.",

It's the intellectual equivalent of some racist boomer screaming snowflake while clumsily hammering keys. It's not edgy it's not cool, its certainly not insulting.

Not sure what there is to even downvote. I can tell you specifically that faculty have not been told anything along the line of faculty not being able to move seating as long as the guidelines are being met... and considering the placards in the pictures don't appear to have been moved...

I don't think that simply measuring by seating alone is sufficient. That's all I've said, don't care about any letters of any law. But ASU does... they think that slashing seating in half is strictly enough. Which is evidenced by the fact that's the ONLY guideline they've pushed to faculty. So I'm not sure what you're talking about here.\n\nWhat is sufficient? I have no idea. I'm not an epidemiologist, but I bet that any reputable one would say \"eh just slash seating in half\" without any other caveats.",

Today ASU positivity is a little less than 2.5% compared to about 4% in the surrounding area. I think we can expect that the positivity rate in the ASU community will eventually match that of the Tempe community since the students live in the Tempe community, shopping at stores, interacting with the community and working in the community (nobody really physically distances from their coworkers anywhere). I understand you think there are wild parties going on but much of those rumors were due to a fake instagram account boasting of parties that never actually happened. ASU is mandatory testing students weekly and also at random. Tests are also available for free on demand. They are isolating the students with positive tests and publishing the addresses of those affected with diseases. I don't believe there is a legal basis for the forced medical testing they're doing or publishing the results of that testing but that's what's happening to these young adults. They're also required to wear masks when they're on campus even outside, even when there are excessive heat warnings even though heat related deaths in AZ are up more than 30%. They're under threat of expulsion if they attend a social event with more than 10 people, fail to social distance, or fail to wear a mask on or off campus. Some students are afraid to attend worship services and visit family because of ASU's invasive, oppressive rules.\n\nThe rate of increase (to which you're referring) is not the same as the positivity rate.  I believe UArizona (U of A), Tucson is the fastest growing area right now.\n\nThey're wearing masks pretty universally on and off campus and if that really works, there's not a good case for ASU students transmitting COVID to vulnerable populations so I just disagree on that. If ASU students are a real transmission problem, they'll pass and pass it around until they achieve herd immunity which will happen pretty quickly if it's as bad as you claim. Don't even start on \"you can get it again\" because if that's true the vaccines aren't going to work at all, billions of dollars are being pointlessly wasted on that and we should all give up on mitigation and just live our lives because everybody will eventually get a chance at bat with COVID.\n\nThe students looked like they were still about 6' apart and ASU has online availability for every class every day, students can decide each day what their risk tolerance is and go to class or watch online. This teacher now let's them sit wherever they want but to be clear they have a choice to sit in their dorm room too. There was very little social distancing or mask wearing in Tempe after dark all summer, the hysteria now really seems disingenuous.\n\nThis seems to be about control more than it is about health. The onus for personal health and safety needs to be on the individual. If you're scared, stay home, keep your distance, wash your hands and please put on a CLEAN mask, it's not my responsibility to take care of you or the hypothetical straw-grandmother.",

Rent is 815 total per month for your own private bedroom &amp; bath, utilities and a parking pass at Tempe Alight Apartments off Apache and McClintock. The apartment is right outside the light rail &amp; a seven minute drive to the ASU campus. Lease starts July 25th and move in date is August 5th. If you signed today you would be paying 970 a month versus 815 if you take over my lease so you are saving 155 a month.",

Then you can discuss with your roommates/dormmates to talk about whether or not to allow friends/partners into the dorm.",

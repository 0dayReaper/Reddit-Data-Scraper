    "postText": "Hello everyone, I am a recently admitted student for pursuing MS in Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning. I would greatly appreciate some information about the various opportunities available in terms of labs, resources, and projects related to the field of Machine Learning.\n\nWhile I am already aware of the DMML (Data Mining and Machine Learning) Lab, I am curious to know if there are any other similar labs or research groups that focus on Machine Learning or related fields. I am particularly interested in exploring areas such as Deep Learning, Data Science, and Big Data. Therefore, any information or recommendations in these domains (and Machine Learning) would be highly valuable to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: It would be really helpful if I know about any of the other resources as it will really help me if I have some prior knowledge about the same before I start my masters.",

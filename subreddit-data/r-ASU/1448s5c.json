    "postText": "Looking to get my masters in EE here, but had a few questions from current students/recent graduates.\n\nHow long does it take to get your masters at ASU, and how long are classes?\n\nHow well structured are the online classes?\n\nHow user friendly is the online portal for classes?\n\nHow are tests administered? (Ie, i have to find a local proctor, I have to install a program on my pc that gives them full access to my pc,, zoom calls, 24h time frame, etc...)\n\nHow hard do you feel the coursework is vs time given to complete?\n\nWhat are yalls oppinions on the course itself? Are you learning alot, or is it very generalized information?\n\nDo the professors seam to care about education, or are they just there for the paycheck?\n\nWould you suggest ASU online to some one else? Im weighing ASU online vs Perdue online. Thanks!",

            "comment": "The hardest part of the online curriculum is IMO is the beginning for engineers and for me as a physics major. Calc I-III and Differential Equations at ASU are pretty garbage, as are PHY121/122 and PHY131/132. They are all 7 week courses (Calc I does have one 15 week session). \n\nAt first all classes are 7 week sessions split up in A/B sessions so you can technically fly through them and knock them out quick. This works really well if you can handle the fast pace of the courses and if you are okay with teaching yourself almost everything. \n\nEvery class I\u2019ve had has been the same: asynchronous lectures that barely cover the material, read the text book and use outside resources to truly learn it, do your homework and quizzes and exams on time. Professors are very rarely in charge of material as ASU posts lecture videos from a multitude of professors and whoever your main professor is for the course is essentially a moderator who makes sure things go ok and you can contact in an emergency. Some are cool, some are not. This changes when you get to the upper division classes, but at the lower end of the spectrum, it\u2019s just all over the place. Labs don\u2019t work right (MATLAB for MAT 275, PHY132 come to mind), professors post the wrong material, reply with \u201clook at the syllabus\u201d, etc. \n\nAll tests have been administered via Honorlock. It\u2019s ok, but it\u2019s relatively invasive and can be annoying to deal with if you\u2019re like me and work and have kids. My exam times are always at 4 am or 11 pm right before the exam closes because I don\u2019t have any other time alone. Plan accordingly for that. \n\nThe courses are not difficult in general, (I have not taken EE upper divs, but we share the same lower divs as physics and EE majors) the time constraints you are given depending on your personal life and the lack of care with the course set ups are what creates issues. I think that Calc I-III can definitely be taught in 7 week sessions if you have the time to put in (20+ hours per week). If not, it\u2019s a struggle and creates a lot of personal issues with family + work. \n\nI feel that my education is not as good as those going to in person programs but this is just a personal opinion. I have noticed that I am struggling more because I feel like my math and lower division physics classes were rushed and now I don\u2019t know things I should know for beginning upper division stuff. This could also be me, though, for what it\u2019s worth. The program for EE\u2019s seems fine and EE and Mech E are pretty popular at ASU. Almost all of my friends in classes have been EE\u2019s. \n\nSome profs care, some don\u2019t. Lower division online courses don\u2019t have a lot of professor interaction at all as noted above, they are just there to be a moderator it seems. Some really don\u2019t care and won\u2019t respond to your emails or your concerns, especially when your daughter needs emergency surgery due to swallowing a quarter on the day before a test and you get to take your Calc exam in your car in a hospital parking lot on phone wifi (thanks Professor El Jamous for saying \u201cplan accordingly\u201d to my email in regards to this).\n\nAll in all, the program can be worth it if you handle the course work being primarily 7 week semesters on information you\u2019ve probably never seen before. The first year + half of your second year will be very fast and you\u2019re going to be taking in a LOT of information without much room for falling behind or fucking up. I recommend the program to most people because I think that the majority of people doing these programs can handle it but I\u2019ve seen a huge amount of people getting fucked because they underestimate how fast the program goes and they\u2019re used to taking general elective type courses. You need to be confident in your ability to self regulate yourself, motivate yourself to do the work, and not fall behind at all. If you can do that, you\u2019re good to go.",

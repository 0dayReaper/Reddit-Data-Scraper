    "postText": "EDIT: Thanks everyone for sharing your feedback and opinions! I appreciate you guys taking the time to let me know. I definitely feel more confident about transferring now, but if anyone wants to add to the discussion with their input then they are welcome to! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\n\nHey ASU Redditors,\n\nSo I am from Southern CA (the coastal side), and I am interested in transferring to ASU's in-person campus this fall. I've been an ASU Online student, and I've also visited Arizona before, but wanted a college experience for a little while. I am studying Philosophy, and then on to my Master's there.\n\nAnyways, I was hesitating for two reasons, so I wanted to hear what you guys' experience is like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The summer heat. As someone who lives on the coast, the worst heat we get here is 80-85 degrees, with the exception of September in recent years, where it has gotten to be 95-105 for a week or two. I did my research on Phoenix's weather trends, and it looks like the heat is crazy until around end of October. That's about two months of straight heat intensity (August to October). Though, it is dry heat, so that helps. So I wanted to ask, is it absolutely awful to endure to the point that it would be a struggle for those couple of months until it cools down? Like, would you have to limit your campus engagement and plans/clubs/activities because of how intense it is to just be outside? My prospective classes this fall would be late morning, and my Tues-Thurs courses run until 1 or 2 in the afternoon, during peak sunshine hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. I know that the Tempe campus is the biggest one (Philosophy is only offered at Tempe), but a nice advisor that I spoke to said that it wasn't as big (population-wise) as it seemed, since there are also online students being counted in the total, part-timers, and of course people dropping out mid-semester. My major doesn't have many enrolled students, which is nice, and I am doing only upper-division classes (which means small class sizes), but I am concerned about it just being such a huge crowd on campus that you truly do get \"lost\" so to speak. I definitely don't mind a crowd or a bigger size (my community college had 30k students), but not overly so to the point that there's people everywhere and too much going on.\n\nThanks so much!",

Unless you never plan on leaving, everywhere is going to have worse weather. The heat is pretty rough but a lot of events in the hottest times know this and are held in air conditioning. \n\nI never felt like the Tempe campus was too big population wise, there's a lot of people but it's a huge campus. I met a lot of my friends through smaller classes. I think a 30k person community college wouldn't be too much different, you wouldn't know everyone there.",

Honestly, I prefer to have seasons and temperature fluctuations, so when I've visited other places it's been really nice to able to wear different clothes. It's good to hear that your experience with both the heat and the campus size were doable and that you still had a good time!",

Not oppressive, but definitely get to wear some cold weather clothes without the hassle of snow. It will monsoon in the fall which was always nice as well, some beautiful lightning storms.

That degree basically combines two minors into one full degree, mine was Small Business and Urban Planning. Really like the flexibility and didn't really know what I wanted to do but I learned a lot. \n\nI was really involved in the Snow Devils ski and snowboard club, which at the time was the biggest club on campus, not sure about now. Was a ton of fun, had weekly events, parties and semi-regular ski/snowboard trips. I had a lot of art friends from the dorms and continued to go to all their art shows and events. Football games were fun even though I wasn't the biggest fan of the games. Did a fair share of partying on Mill Ave. Also had a group I would regularly hike with, some beautiful trails not far from campus.",

I wanted to go into Graphic Design originally because I liked working with Photoshop, but then I realized how little my own artistic visions/input would be realized in those situations in my career since people hire GDers to create THEIR vision. Interdisciplinary Studies sounds like a nice degree path though, because you can get more than one deeper study, and it helps to give you a major when you are uncertain, especially since many people in this age range are still figuring it out.\n\nThose sound super fun! Being part of an active club is great. Nature is also a good go-to. It seems like the ongoing advice from those who succeeded is to find like-minded people in your circles and do different kinds of activities, even sports. Haha, I've heard about Mill Avenue's party scene. Overall, it sounds like you did your college experience right. Looking forward to having mine as well!",

The great thing about low humidity is that just getting away from direct sunlight by finding shade and a slight breeze can make a huge difference when you're outside. Definitely hydrate and consume plenty of fluids (either through food or drinking water) to avoid getting heat exhaustion or heat stroke, two very dangerous heat health risks. There are plenty of shade structures around camous, especially outside the Memorial Union (MU) which has a solar panel shaded pavillion where you can sit outside and eat lunch. Most clubs meet in the late afternoon/evening hours since that's when most people are available but you aren't necessarily outside for these unless it's like the Garden club or something else that requires outside activities.\n\n2. Tempe campus is big. Like *really* big. It's the most populated campus for ASU and houses the biggest programs like life sciences, business, and engineering. It's true that throughout the semester and academic year the number of people decrease due to those factors you mentioned but there are still loads of people that it can take you a long time to grab something to eat at the MU during peak lunch time and make it hard to find a group study spot at the library. That said, whether you want to get lost in the crowd or find your group of friends is entirely up to you. Many find friends through their classes, special interest clubs, university/club events (plenty of those!), or through chance encounters. I also transferred (into Junior year) from a community college, though it was a local one but I managed to grow a sizable friend group in one year of on campus instruction post-pandemic restriction during my undergrad. Some schools/programs are given their own slice of Tempe campus where the majority of your classes will be so you can literally only interact among that area. WP Carey has their own area, same with the arts, Fulton Engineering is near the Life Sciences, etc.",

It's always nice to hear in detail how it goes and what you've found and any successes that happen. I'm glad that it worked out for your situation, and yeah, humid heat can be real unpleasant, but it sounds like Arizona heat IS bearable with shade and provisions. I'm almost amazed that people can go to college in Florida from out of state, where the humidity can be not only intense but also year-round. It's good that the campus does work well around the heat between buildings and activities, and that things are going on at the right times. It's also nice to hear that people find their people there through their niche/school area. Yeah, if you can do it post-pandemic, you can do it anytime. Thankfully I've got all upper-division courses as well, so the classes should be mostly if not completely small, and like you I am transferring in on my last year as well. And it sounds like it's still going strong for you if you're on your PhD! Props to you, that can be really hardcore.",

Yeah, it's one of the main required classes to graduate for our major, but my advisor (Justin Cappuccili, who is awesome!

That's definitely a bit harsh, but at least it was hopefully helpful feedback? Haha. Ah, so sorry about 307! I had that exact same problem with MAT 211 (second required Business math course) when I was studying Business here online. 8 weeks, Calculus 2, and 80% of the grade hinged on two exams. No memory sheets or index cards. Brutal. That's why I switched over to Philosophy \ud83d\ude06 307 sounds especially tricky, given that both Philosophy and Law are complex topics. It's a real bummer when they offer a limited hard format. If you can survive Calhoun, though, then you have a good shot! Talk with some of your other teachers that you hit it off with and see if you can get some office hours help if needed! Hopefully it works out for you.",

But I spend majority of time indoors or in places where there's air conditioning (home, classes, buses, etc), Since I am not too much of an extrovert and don't go out much, so it doesn't bother me. Also, the evenings are quite pleasant so you can definitely go out as well. \n2. The campus is crowded but there's a place for everyone. So don't worry about being lost!",

It sounds like much of the campus does adhere to temperature restrictions anyway (aside from class times), so it isn't too bad. Plus the evenings are nice as you said. And thank you! That's good to hear from someone else that they've found their place. How long have you been with ASU, and what are you studying?",

There will be rapid changes in average temperature, happening over the course of weeks, not months. Have real winter clothes. It's not overly cool to some folks out of state, but many find it too cold without something beyond shorts and a flannel.",

And to me, at least, it doesn\u2019t start to feel \u201cHOT\u201d hot until June. Like right now, it\u2019s fine. Once it\u2019s above 105, yeah, that\u2019s hot. But we migrate from one A/C space to another in June, July, and August. \n\nBy mid-October, it feels to me like southern CA weather. \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine.",

That's what I've heard from a few people, actually, that post-summer weather is excellent for several months, and it's really enjoyable for being on campus and going into the city. And then it doesn't pick up for a while, so you get to enjoy nicer weather long-term. It's nice to hear that many people have survived the crazy heat and can positively recommend their experience. I definitely do feel much more confident about it!",

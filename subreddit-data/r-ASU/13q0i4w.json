    "postText": "I've read online that different schools have different policies when it comes to being off track. Engineering students are often forced to switch majors if they're off track for two consecutive semesters. I was just wondering, how strict are the different schools at ASU when it comes to students being off track? As it seems they enforce different policies. Do any Herberger students have experience with this?",

I turned my 4 year degree into 5 for a few reasons, but i had communicated with my advisors and they were very understanding about different holds and things that were put on my account automatically regarding being off track",

I switched very early on in my art degree so it's just 2 classes I need to catch up on but I was still a bit worried about it. I've read that Liberal arts and herberger aren't so stern if you take a few classes in the wrong order.",

            "comment": "All of the colleges use critical tracking. Being off-track once means that you need to meet with your advisor and make a plan to get back on-track. Being off-track twice for the same requirement means you do need to switch to a different major (and in some cases to another college entirely). \n\nThere can be a few instances where they provide leeway, specifically if there is something outside of your control that affects your tracking status. For example, when I advised in WPC in some instances, if a student was off-track for math but had started in a much lower level and was making progress, the advisor could use discretion to provide an extra term to get the critically-tracked requirement done. But if you are off-track because you failed a class, never bothered to enroll in a critically-tracked course, or did not achieve the required GPA or other milestone, then you are going to be forced to change out. \n\nYour best bet is to meet with your advisor asap to figure out what you are off-track for an how many times. If you are off-track twice for something and are required to change to another major, ask if there is a way to be able to change back to your original major after completing additional requirements.",

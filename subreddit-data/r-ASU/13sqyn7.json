Only thing I\u2019ve heard from my supervisors are that the agency is trying to get funds to the university ASAP, but it doesn\u2019t seem like payment will be impacted. I\u2019m sure if payroll was going to be affected we would\u2019ve been notified a while ago. You\u2019re not the only one concerned though, others in my department have the same concerns.",

Maybe 3% at most last I heard.\n\nMuch more imperative to ASU's budget are the federal grants that faculty earn, of which ASU immediately takes 70% off the top to use at their discretion. Grants are also where funding for grad students comes from, and to a certain degree they're also how some faculty get paid over the summer. And this money isn't just given as a lump sum to be kept under Michael Crow's mattress; generally it's kept in a government account, and depending on the structure of the grant not all of the money is available immediately.\n\nIf a default causes those accounts to get frozen, that will definitely have an impact on ASU which will only get worse the longer it lasts.",

    "postText": "Hi! So I\u2019m applying late, I know it\u2019s terrible and I apologize things just did not go as expected this year. When I try to apply, there is no option for me to report my GED scores, only my high school transcripts, which are incomplete, as I had to drop out unfortunately. I had a 3.5 gpa in high school, and scored well above the 150 minimum on my GED tests. Is there something I\u2019m missing, how would I go about reporting my GED scores? Thank you so much all, I appreciate it!",

There was a class where the prof said mac users had to use some cloud stuff for sql server but that wasn\u2019t true. I just installed SQL server on docker and was fine. You can also run a windows VM on you Mac with something like virtualbox or vmware. Finally, look at parallels for running windows programs on you Mac when needed.",

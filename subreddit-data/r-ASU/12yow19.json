Also if you\u2019re interested in a more complete striking art form I\u2019d look into Muay Thai or just kick boxing in general. Learning to throw and cheque kicks is very important to self defense and Muay Thai competitions are a lot more common. Why just use your fists when you can employ your fists, feet, knees, and elbows.",

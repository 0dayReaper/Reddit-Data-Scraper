    "postText": "I am having my classes paid for by voc rehab. I took 2 classes in the first half of the semester and got a D and a C. I chose to reduce the load in second half of the semester from 2 to 1 and I still struggled because the classes were online and not offered in person. I am afraid voc rehab wont pay for me to retake these classes and they are very expensive. Does ASU offer discounts for retakes? Or am I sol? My advisor said she didnt know.",

Also most voc rehab programs have certain stipulations about mandatory credit hours and grade requirements while attending.\n\nYou really need to talk to your vocational rehabilitation support and verify you are still meeting requirements and if there is any limit on retakes.",

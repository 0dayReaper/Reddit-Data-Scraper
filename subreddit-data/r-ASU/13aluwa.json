Socially, well I\u2019m an EE major so social for me and social for a normal person is 2 different things. But it is fairly easy to make friends.",

Depending on what GCU's curriculum looks like you might be a couple classes behind ASU's schedule because some of those credits won't transfer. It sucks, but it's what it is. I'm catching up by taking a summer class or two when I can afford to. \n\nBeyond that there isn't too much that the school requires of you for the actual transferring. You'll have to send your transcript and do those intro modules, but I'm sure you did something similar for GCU so that shouldn't be too scary. Besides the GCU classes being more religious (?) than ASU's, you'll find that class difficulty and structure is largely the same from school to school. *Especially* if GCU is on Canvas. \n\nThe real work for me was and still is meeting people and feeling fully integrated into my major class. That's an aspect of transferring that is rarely talked about but has been to me by far the most impactful. You don't get the traditional college experiences like dorm roommates, 1st year orientations, etc. to meet people, especially if you live off-campus, which you likely will have to do. It requires a lot more putting yourself out there, which was difficult for me even as a freshman on a level playing field and is even more difficult at times here at ASU where I started behind everyone else.\n\nStill, transferring has 100% been the right choice for me and Tempe is like a 2nd home to me now. It hasn't been without its growing pains but I still thank my past self every day for taking that leap. And don't take for granted everything ASU has to offer. Go watch a football game, go join some weird club, go climb A mountain, go try new restaurants on Mill, go join a sports team, it's all possible here. If you have any more questions, be sure to let me know. Best of luck!",

Free parking, easy to walk around the campus because it wasn't miles long in all directions like ASU. All the professors were super cool and total experts in their field who were passionate about teaching. ASU has grad students teaching the intro courses and some of them are terrible and don't actually want to teach. Getting all your prerequisites out of the way and then transferring them over to ASU is the move. I met a lot of cool people at community college. The classes were smaller and it's less like herding cattle. Don't get me wrong ASU is awesome too but you're going to save a lot of money by doing community college first and you get the opportunity to go to two different schools which keeps it fresh and new. Get out of GCU it's a for-profit school they don't care about your education. Also when you're looking for adult jobs out of college, no one is going to care if you have a community college on your resume first and then ASU, infact it actually looks better because it takes up two lines and makes you look like you make good financial decisions. Best of luck.",

If you\u2019re able to teach yourself, the curriculum is free online. Just scope out the coursework and books and translate that into a personal education program. Your wallet will thank you later. \n2. Gateway portal | Most of the students are international and much younger than I was. As an early 30s individual, re-entering school was a reminder that kids are, well kids. I was continually underwhelmed by my peers contributions. 2/3 of the student cohort was Indian, many whom were in America for their first time. The program provides them with a 3-year visa to find a job without needing sponsorship. Good on them for seeking better opportunities abroad. Nonetheless, it was a tiresome task of refactoring low quality writing of my teammates. I\u2019ll leave it at that\u2026\n3. The most premiere organizations no longer require a college degree for entry level roles (Amazon, Google etc). Learn technical skills as part of #1, see above.\n\nGood luck!",

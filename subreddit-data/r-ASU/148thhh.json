    "postText": "Just finished my first year like lots of people, but around halfway through first semester I went through a very traumatic experience where my best friend committed suicide. I still did okay, but this understandable caused my grades to slip. Prioritizing other classes and my job during this time, I ended up failing ASU101 two semesters in a row. I know I could\u2019ve passed it easily, I messed up \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but I\u2019m just having a really hard time getting back on my feet because of it. It feels as though my parents and peers don\u2019t understand why i failed, chalking it up to me not working hard enough. I already have a plan and systems in place to make sure I do better next year, but I guess I just wanna hear someone tell me it\u2019ll all be okay lol",

Partial compassionate/medical withdrawals are very hard to get approved because you have to present solid reasoning for doing well in some classes while not doing well in others.\n\nAlso, with compassionate (and medical) withdrawal petitions, you need to submit documentation. The med/comp contact for your college can help you understand what the process looks like and what would happen if it is approved.\n\nI am sorry for your loss and wish you healing.",

You're still living and your friend's always gonna live with you as long as you're alive. You still can make your best friend happy by doing well in life! I'm proud of you that despite all this, you're committed to education! It'll definitely take you far... Your parents and friends need not understand you and would never exactly do so too... Because they can't dwell inside you and feel the same way you do... So stay true to yourself! It's gonna make everyone happy :)... Also if you need someone to talk to, my DMs are open :) just know that the world needs people who stand despite being hit hard... Not people with mere 4gpa... You're the former one! I wish you the best and I'm sure you got this!",

Let me tell you, no one is gonna care or remember this in a few years. It sucks and you may think about it occasionally but it is literally a drop in the bucket of your life. If you come back and own it with stellar grades, then it almost becomes even more impressive. Like - look what you started with and how you turned it around! Use it. Trust me - You\u2019re gonna fuck up so much worse than this in your life in many other ways LOL. This is okay and it will get better and one day you won\u2019t feel that icky feeling anymore when you think about it. Good luck bud, like others have said, I\u2019m here for you if you need somebody to vent to",

It was a very traumatic experience and really made my life feel out of control for awhile. Your reaction is completely valid and I'm sorry people in your life aren't seeing that. Grief is a really tricky thing, it's not linear and can come and go at really random and unexpected times. But you will find ways to cope with it and get back on track. \n\nIf you haven't talked to a therapist I would really recommend it. I also found that talking to other people who had lost loved ones to suicide was helpful. It is a specific type of grief that can be really hard to deal with. I know there are support groups out there but I also went to r/SuicideBereavement for a lot of help",

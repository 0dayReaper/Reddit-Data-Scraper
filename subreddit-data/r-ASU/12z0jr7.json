Some people say yes, some people only say some, and I saw some floor plan pictures where the middle two rooms have full and the other have twin. I'm in room D and would really prefer to have a full bed. If anyone knows, please share!",

I was in room D (not comfortable sharing the exact room number) and had a full-sized bed.\n\nThe thing is, those bedrooms are so small that sometimes it's actually better to have a smaller bed for more open/walkable space since they can't be raised as high as the twin-XLs.",

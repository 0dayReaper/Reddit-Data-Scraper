    "postText": "Is ASU a good place for sophomore year transfer students? I am at University of San Francisco now and everyone is boring and depressed here, but I don't want to transfer if I am going to end up with no friends and have nothing to do. It's extremely expensive here and our campus is completely dead, the city kills the party scene at the school and I can't take it anymore, its extremely hard to meet people and they don't offer anything that I enjoy so it has been hard to get to do what I like here. Would it be much of a risk in switching? I don't really know how to find out if it would be a good fit for me.",

If you generally have trouble making friends or finding things to do then moving won't help that. You'll just have trouble making friends and finding things to do in a different place. \n\nSan Francisco is incredible and has a lot to offer. You say the city kills the party scene. I think it's more likely that the city is the party scene. Go party in the city. Yes ASU has a solid bar/club scene and a thriving frat scene with daily house parties. That will be different but you've gotta be about that life. You don't get into those parties for free or without some affiliation. \n\nPrice is clearly a complicated subject. San Francisco is expensive but so is moving to ASU, paying out of state tuition etc. \n\nThis post sounds far more like someone young adjusting to the real world. You've had people planning for you your whole life. When all the structures of high school disappear it's hard to adjust. \n\nThen again if you can't take it you can't take it. Sometimes the cost of staying is greater than the cost of leaving",

With the money you would be spending going to ASU (if out of state) you might as well just buy a car and explore Northern California. ASU has a huge party scene but that can get old pretty quickly. I recommend focusing on school in order to be able to afford to have the life you want after college. Transferring would just complicate things unnecessarily IMO.",

It also depends on a lot, the entirety of social life here seems to be greek life involved. i\u2019ve struggled making friends as someone who has hard classes and didn\u2019t have time for that. when i spoke to usfca kids they said the same abt no party scene in the city unless you were 21 or had a fake and often said theyd travel to berkley or other areas so maybe try and explore the bay if you havent.  it all depends on what you want to get out of school and what youre willing to put into it as well",

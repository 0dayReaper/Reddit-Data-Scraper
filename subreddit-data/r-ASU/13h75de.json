I can't remember where the links are but if you go onto discord and click [the button in the bottom left ](https://imgur.com/a/eZjtlDT) with the one dot that splits to 3 dots, and type in your ASU email, you can find some awesome communities! Some even have shared learning resources such as links to free online versions of books!\n\nHope that helps",

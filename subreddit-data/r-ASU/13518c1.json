    "postText": "Currently enrolled full time (online) with 30 credit hrs left and am looking to pick up a minor. The minor in project management looks appealing as it is relevant to my field and past professional experience. My questions are the following:\n\n1. Has anyone completed it online and how was your experience.\n\n2. Overall difficulty and level / frequency of math for the program. \n\n3. Is it worth taking, or should I just finish up my BA and focus on my masters.\n\nThanks in advance!",

You can always pickup a PMI certificate for PM, but you're not going to get a chance at any HLS certificate, academic or not, as easily as you can through ASU/SPGS, unless HLS is your future organization's specific focus. The PM minor won't be particularly valuable on its own, as the PM major is pretty weak itself without  any PMI certifications added later. Is your grad program PM?",

I never picked up a PMI cert. during my time as a PM or PgM, as I never found a need. Now that I'm a year away from being done with MAGS and looking at new IA/IS&amp;D programs, I'm thinking about PMI certs again for an added boost into private sector applications, specifically PgMP/PfMP. A good combination of prof. background, non-redundant education, and certs can be pretty powerful.",

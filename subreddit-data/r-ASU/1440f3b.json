    "postText": "This summer is the first one where I'm taking classes through the university, with some that are on-campus. However, going in and out of my one class and to the SDFC, one of the things that seemed odd was that walk-only zones were still in effect. The reason it's odd is that during summer class changes, the walk-only zones still seem to be less busy than the areas that aren't walk-only zones during fall/spring class changes. When there isn't a class change, the walk-only zones are pretty empty. I understand why the walk-only zones are in effect during the fall and spring, as those areas can be challenging to bike through with all the students, and even at the 5:30 PM class change, which are the time the walk-only rules are no longer in effect, it can still be a little hectic to bike through there.",

Honestly ASU should just tell people no more bikes or electric scooters near the middle of campus and Tempe should give out tickets to people who use the sidewalks surrounding campus when there are bike lanes.  If you're on foot you have the right of way on sidewalks.  People don't respect that.  I've seen many other people yell \"use the bike lane!\" when they about get run over...",

Otherwise, I agree. Then again, college students in general aren't the brightest when it comes to following road rules, as there has been at least one time I was riding on University Drive in the area around PSH and had to ring my bike bell at a jaywalker, and the worst part is that there are multiple crossings without much distance between them (McAllister Ave, McAllister Mall, Palm Walk overpass, Cady Mall/College Avenue), and there one time I was riding up Mill Avenue from 11th Street to 10th Street and accidentally hit someone because she tried to cross Mill at 10th Street without realizing I was on Mill. Thankfully I never injured anyone.",

And it's unfortunate that e-scooters are technically banned on campus, though people still bring them on-campus due to a lack of enforcement. I've never been on an e-scooter, so I don't know what it's like compared to riding a bike, though in terms of speed, I can still keep up with them while riding a non-electric bike, and my bike isn't even that light, and I normally ride with only a moderately fast gear setting, which, for me, is the perfect compromise between top speed and acceleration from a complete stop. The other thing I like about having a bike is that I can carry stuff on the bike. The one advantage I see with an e-scooter is portability, as bringing my bike on the light rail and putting it on the hanging racks can be a hassle, even though I'm fairly tall.",

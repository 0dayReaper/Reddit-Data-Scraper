The process isn\u2019t as easy and I\u2019m trying to see if I can get something to do this semester. Meanwhile I just feel so bored since there\u2019s no school and I don\u2019t get to meet people. Just wanna ask anyone want to hang out this summer and prolly do something fun and develop ourselves together, like gym, rock climbing, etc.?",

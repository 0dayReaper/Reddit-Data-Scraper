This isn\u2019t about censorship there\u2019s just been so many fights since COVID started on any semi political post so we pin these comments to dissuade it. At worst the comments would be locked.\n\nEdit 2: It has come to my attention that we are drawing some trolls from other subs. Feel free to @ myself or another moderator if they are violating rules.\n\nEdit 3: This conversation has ceased to be productive and has attracted a number of non r/ASU submitters who feel the need to troll and drum up political discussion outside the scope of ASU. As such, this post is locked.",

She raised hell about being racial profiled, and a bunch of working class staff caught hell for it. But it turns out she was in the wrong, had jumped to a conclusion, and leveraged her social identity to raise a brigade of would-be allies who jumped at the chance to attack white supremacy without bothering to check the details. The NY Times story is really fascinating. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/us/smith-college-race.html",

Instead of talking to the guys in private to discuss their concerns like a mature adult, they started the \"conversation\" by recording them on their phone and putting them on blast by throwing around accusations of racism. I'm more angry about how the situation was handled by the people recording than anything else, and that's why I'd say they're 100% responsible for the incident.

You could wear offensive clothing in class if you please as long as it's not a direct threat to anyone or a call to violence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomeone has to be actively disruptive to fun afoul of the \"interfering with an institution of higher learning\"\n\nHere's the relevant statute....https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/02911.htm  some people like to cite \"fighting words\" doctrine as a reason to be disruptive and/or violent which hasn't been a thing for a very very long time.....\n\n&gt;In Collin v. Smith (1978) Nazis displaying swastikas and wearing military-style uniforms marching through a community with a large Jewish population, including survivors of German concentration camps, were not using fighting words.\n\nSo no.  You cannot even consider literal Nazis frog marching down the street in nazi uniforms as fighting words and a legal predication to be disruptive and/or violent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMAYBE there's an argument to be made regarding harassment and discriminatory graphics something something disruption but it would be specious at best the way the ABOR code of conduct and ASU manuals are written.  Harassment is specifically defined as behavior in those texts.",

I really don't see how they claim ASU is centered to white cis-males, I get the claim that females are more at risk on college campuses because of predatory males, but not the white claim. There are so many \"multicultural\" organizations on campus, faculty, and mentors from all backgrounds, speakers brought in from every continent, etc. I know that in other institutions there's a systematic white advantage, but I really don't think ASU is one of those places.\n\nHere's what I think happened. They got Chick-Fil-A at the MU and had to study (and anyone saying they shouldn't have Chick-Fil-A, I personally don't eat there because I don't like their ethics, but I don't think everyone eating there, including the 45-minute line almost every day to eat there at lunch rush, is homophobic). There was nowhere to eat inside and its hotter than Satan's ballsack outside so they went into the student pavilion and found somewhere to eat. That guy always has the laptop sticker on, he didn't slap it on when he walked in there. That hat is really popular with people up north, regardless of political officiation. It seems a lot to do about nothing. Hopefully, the deans just say that to, and if anything tell those girls not to scream at other people on campus, and if they have a problem to let police or campus officials to deal with it.\n\nIf anyone reads this and thinks I'm harping \"white people are under attack\", no that's not what I'm saying because white people are not under attack (grow up if you think so). I'm saying this is by far an overreaction, directly racist towards white people, and everyone's day would have been better if they just focused on their midterms instead of making a scene.",

            "comment": "There are some very obvious main points in the video that seem to be getting watered down or stated from a place of anger (understandable from both sides of this event).\n\n* These two men (most notably the man in the bass pro hat) look genuinely surprised they were being harassed; leading to the logical conclusion that they *may* not have known it was a multicultural space.\n* Wearing a \"blue live matter\" t-shirt is *not* racist; albeit many who wear it are wearing as an act of racial aggression toward BLM. \n* Even if the men knew what they were doing, the recording woman (the other seemed to be much more calm and understanding towards the end) is still very much in the wrong for confronting these men the way she did.\n* Again, even if they knew what they were doing, the people inside the multicultural space that had an issue with the sticker (or just questions) should have approached the men and asked to have a discussion about it. That is the PRIMARY purpose of multiculturalism; to open the doors of communication between different cultures. The secondary purpose of multiculturalism is to give a safe place for minority cultures to feel safe from the dominant culture of a nation/community by not feeling the pressure to assimilate to the dominant culture. Having the dominant culture there does not impede on these purposes if both are open to communicating their cultures.\n* If multiculturalism is to bridge the gap of communication between cultures, keep diverse cultures thriving, and not feel the pressure of the dominant culture of the nation/community, then you have to agree that \"white\" is in effect a culture, regardless of whether you are a white Irish, White Jew, or white South African; **you can belong to more than one culture...**\n* The recording woman discriminated against the following groups:\n\n\n1. Cis-men (noted, they are not a minority)\n2. All minority cultures (ethnicities) that happen to have a lower amount of melanin toward the surface of their skin due to the environment their heritage came from (\"white skinned\").\n3. ~~People who voted for Biden but not for any racial reason (i.e, white supremacists), which the larger majority of the LGBTQ+ community did vote for (*\"National Exit Poll reported that 64 percent of LGBT voters favored Biden\" and \"AP VoteCast found that 73 percent of LGBT voters supported Biden\"*) as well as 87% of the black vote, 65% of the Hispanic/Latino/Latina vote, 61% of the Asian vote, and 41% of white voters~~. **I must have been too tired when I wrote this, I thought the shirt said \"I voted for Biden\", please excuse this point.**\n4. All poverty related minorities that are white.\n5. All disabled military veterans (which are classified as a culture) that are white.\n\n\n**I am sure there are more cultures, minorities, and/or groups that the recording woman is effectively now** *preventing* **from using this space as they will now feel unsafe to use the space if they fall into one of the above groups; thus making the last \"4 years of hard work\" to get this room approved by ASU not as effective as it should be. Which also pushes back multiculturalism as a whole on the ASU campus; she has done more harm to multiculturalism in this video than any number of \"blue lives matter\" stickers could have.**\n\n\n\nNow, I said a lot, I researched a lot of this before posting, and understandably may have made a few people angry, sad, or even confused. That is fine, and I am more than happy to change my views based off of a normal calm act of communication to teach me the error of my currently held beliefs. \n\n*You should also know I am talking from a perspective as a stereotypical white man who happens to also be a disabled veteran, first generation college student, grew up in poverty trailers/homelessness, and I do understand white privilege has definitely helped spring me from many of the traps that make it harder for other non-white minorities to advance; as unfair and morally wrong as that is.*",

Either way it's pretty hard to quantify.

The Romani people are oppressed for who they are, they're Gypsies, many Europeans literally see them as scum. In India, for example, theres extreme oppression as well, they literally have a caste system. You'll never see anything as bad in America. The reason America seems worse is because we live here and everything's amplified. America is seen as culture defining and a media center of the world, so everyone knows what the country does. That's why US Politics are extremely popular everywhere. I'm from South Africa attending ASU and a LOT of people there care about USA Politics more than SA politics, same with the news.  \n\n\nThe idea that America is very racist is usually from people who were born in America and haven't lived/travelled(for a long time) outside the country at all really, and I don't mean that in an offensive way, but compared to most countries, America is probably top 5-7 least racist countries in the world. American's are usually just seeing America as the center of everything and think it is. (again not trying to be rude it's just how it is, well at least to me.)  \n\n\nLastly, there is \"white culture\". Except you're using it wrong, there's no such thing as \"White culture\" OR \"black culture\" because culture isn't defined by race, more by ethnicity and  identity that isn't just race. Do Nigerians in Africa have culture? Do Ethiopians in Africa? Both, yes absolutely. Are they the same culture? No. Theres tons of cultures inside 1 country even. You don't just say \"Black culture\" because what's that even mean, there's so much? White people do have culture as well, and it's racist and stupid to say otherwise. Do Irish-Gaelic people not have culture? Do Nordic-Icelandic people not have culture? They have just as much culture AND history.  \n\n\nAgain, not meant to come off as rude or anything in this, hope this helps answer your questions",

You're right in saying most of the floor space is available to all students to study and lounge between classes, but the second floor of the Pavilion is where the official dedicated offices for the multi-cultural orgs like the Black African Coalition are situated. This goes for the Hispanic/Latino orgs, Women's Coalition, and the Rainbow coalition.  Not at all saying they have the authority to kick someone out of this space, or that these guys were even necessarily aware of the purpose of this space, but I don't think it's difficult to recognize that it's pretty tone-deaf and antagonistic to sport a \"Police Lives Matter\" sticker in front of the Black African coalition given the political climate of the last year.\n\nEdit: After running through this video a few times, I realized I'm mistaken. The video makes reference to the second and first floor as spaces available to them. The space I'm referring to is technically the 2nd floor, separated from the ground floor by the mezzanine, which carries much more obvious signage for the coalitions.

Super troll-like.\n\nNow, I think that's a bit of a reach, especially because of what all needs to be assumed but I certainly think that's what these women were interpreting it as and why there was such a strong reaction. Not 100% sure of the origins of the term \"Police Lives Matter,\" admittedly, but I think there's a better chance than not that it's in response to BLM. So if you've spent time on Black civil rights discussions as it seems the woman behind the camera has and seen or participated in the protests last summer or even before, you've probably seen plenty pf troll-like, subtle, race-baity behavior just like they were assuming this was. Just not in this domain where you don't have the authority to kick someone out of the space.",

Not that everyone is aware of that. The additional spaces outside of the offices are available for students to study/lounge, but from the looks of this video, the guys are sitting almost immediately outside of the Black African Coalition offices.\n\nThe setting definitely matters, no matter how poorly I think these women dropped the ball on the execution on this conversation. The merit of the argument is there: asking someone to leave the adjacent space dedicated to Black &amp; African students where there is something that can most certainly be viewed as offensive to that group of students, especially considering the political climate of the last year.\n\nEdit: I'm mistaken. The video takes place on the third floor of the Student Pavilion, which must serve as a newly-established space for the multicultural solidary co. The second floor, where the coalitions' office are is separated from the ground floor by the mezzanine, which itself is not technically a floor.",

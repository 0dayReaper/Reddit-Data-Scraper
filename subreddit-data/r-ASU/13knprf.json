    "postText": "I got a full tuition scholarship for the summer AFTER taking out a federal loan. The \"estimate\" refund amount from ASU was $2000 short. I got a message from financial aid the other day saying they had processed a student account refund for me and I should receive it Friday... but now the estimated refund on my finances tab disappeared. I still have this loan, so should I be worried about where the money went? They can't cancel loans without permission, correct? I need the money from the loan to pay for outside school expenses (computer, housing for the summer, etc). Should I call financial aid if I don't receive the refund Friday?",

Now however, I have an account review hold and my scholarship is on a disbursement hold. This after it showed I was supposed to get a refund twice. I called and have a case opened and escalated. Plan on bugging them as I also have things outside school I need to pay for.",

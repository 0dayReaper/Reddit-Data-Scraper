For example, you might do a communications major entirely online through ASU online. However, you could also do a chemistry major in-person. As that chemistry student, you could take a couple of your classes as iCourses. \n\nMost of the time, in-person students cannot register for ASU online classes and ASU online students cannot register for icourses.",

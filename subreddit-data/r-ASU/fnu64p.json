We petitioned to suspend classes and he said no. That only happened when it was mandated by forces greater than him.\n\nI've sung his praises in the past, but he's not living up to his good reputation at the moment.",

He has lobbied the legislature every year but there's no traction with the imbeciles that get elected here. All three AZ publics are in the same boat and tuition has risen in all three to the same degree (see chart in this thread).",

            "comment": "ASU Alumnus Data Dude here.... correlation is not causation.\n\nI know it feels bad when you see a line like that, and you might see an event that corresponds with the line.  But you can't assume that one thing drives the other.\n\n1 - Your chart is old.\n\nIt ends with year 11-12 - that's 9 years ago. In fact, the place that you might have got it from ([graph of the week](http://www.graphoftheweek.org/2011/12/description-arizona-state-university.html)) has a dead link to the original PDF.  You're trying to paint a person based on some history you don't really understand.\n\nSo... check out [this table](https://www.azregents.edu/sites/default/files/public/Tuition%20and%20Fees%20Historical%202018.pdf) that shows that the following year (i.e. 12-13) had a 0% increase, and after that it has only gone up 1% to 3% (basically cost of living increase).\n\nIf you're going to blame Crow for the hike, then you also have to blame Crow for the 0% as well.\n\n2 - University budgets are complicated\n\nArizona State University's 2019 budget was about $3B.  Student Tuition only makes up a portion of the University's budget (2019 it was 50%), because the State of Arizona only gives ASU a small amount (2019 it was 11%).  The rest of the 30-ish% comes from Federal grants, income from patents, and other things. ([see this budget breakdown](https://cfo.asu.edu/current-budget)).\n\nWhile Crow is the most visible person, there are many people under him that help him make a decision one way or another.  And, believe me, in his heart, Crow is always thinking of the students first.\n\n3 - State Funding vs. Student Tuition\n\nOn [this chart](https://cfo.asu.edu/stateinvestment) you can see the funding from the State of Arizona has continually diminished year over year.  Primarily, this is due to the decrease in taxes paid to the state that ends up reducing the amount available to ASU.\n\nIn turn, ASU has chosen to make up the budget with tuition increases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hear your frustration, but the story really begins and ends with taxes.  If the State of Arizona has money, then ASU will have more money and tuition will decrease.\n\nI know you want to blame someone for your high tuition - and I agree that it sucks.  But Crow isn't your bad guy, the State of Arizona isn't your bad guy.\n\nOur society has decided that taxes are bad, so that de-funds your school.  If you want tuition to go down (without shrinking the school), then you need to be an advocate of Arizona funding ASU better.\n\nSucky?!?  Yep - way sucky, because there's no single person to blame - and then to change it YOU actually have to get involved.\n\nWelcome to Adulting 201.",

            "comment": "Yeah...I feel like ASU transitioned to a for-profit model; and I do have issues with a lot of the ways that ASU spends money under Crow. To me, ASU spends a really inappropriate amount (proportionately) on 'innovative' 'strategic' programs or 'investiments' that often don't pan out in the long run. (Look at the number of discontinued majors -- why not just add courses to existing majors and strengthen them? Why do we need a separate school for \\[insert hot topic/subject here\\] that will not be relevant and will die out in a few years, rather than just offering them as courses within a major? Why do we need a major in civic &amp; economic thought when we could just strengthen Political Science &amp; Economics coursework? Why launch ASU for You right now, rather than focusing on existing programs (including that already serve non-students?) That's not to mention for profit business ventures and real estate development in the Tempe area.\n\n I also think ASU spends an inappropriate amount on advertising/recruiting new students; and that it should really focus on core/standard investments (in faculty, in quality advisors and advising, in curriculum development, etc.) and students will find ASU, rather than throwing money at bringing them here without focusing on resources for them once they get here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo",

Calculus is the only topic I\u2019ve been this bad at and would love teachers who have good lectures and maybe information on what program they use? (Rody used Pearson for hw and tests, for example)",

They will be getting rid of all Universal Learner options sometime next year (which they really should have announced on the website + email), but it will still be available for those who have already signed up. Shame they\u2019re getting rid of those options, but I guess it\u2019s not worth it to them financially. :-/",

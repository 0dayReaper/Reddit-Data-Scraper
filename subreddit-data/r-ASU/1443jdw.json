    "postText": "I failed MAT 117. I didn't finish stuff on time it was so intense. Then I found out they have a longer version with less demands. \n\nBut I wanted to check if I could retake the Aleks to score higher with the stuff I re-learned and be put into my core math class? Or does taking math with the score I had stops me from going for a higher score? \n\nNever done online school before and I'm originally from PR as well so I'm not sure.\n\nThanks in advance",

I really recommend doing that so you get the credit and can have time to go back over the concepts.",

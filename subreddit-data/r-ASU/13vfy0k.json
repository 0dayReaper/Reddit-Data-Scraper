It's hard to find a professor willing or able to fund you through an RA position since that covers full tuition plus a few other benefits. Not entirely sure if CS if the same as other programs I know of but the thesis and non-thesis are typically over 2 years in engineering. The [CS graduate handbook](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/handbooks/) should outline both options and give a better overview of the program.",

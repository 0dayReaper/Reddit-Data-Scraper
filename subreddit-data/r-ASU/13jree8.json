He helped me a lot with understanding older British texts, specifically (Chaucer, Shakespeare, etc), but that definitely translates to other books, too.\n\nBesides that, ENG200 is a good place to start. I don\u2019t remember exactly what the course is called, but it\u2019s basically an intro to literary theory class. You read some books, learn about words like \u201cpostmodernism,\u201d and write a couple essays. It\u2019s a good foundation course if you wanted to take more literature classes, but it\u2019s broad enough that you\u2019ll get a lot out of it even if it\u2019s the only class you take.",

    "postText": "So I have been dealing with this for about a month now, and I don\u2019t know what to do and it is stressing me out. \n\nI have a college internship, and I was told at the end of April that I need to be enrolled into ASU by May 31. So I enrolled and sent in my transcripts on April 26, and here we are, May 18, and I haven\u2019t heard anything. I attended Mesa, Chandler-Gilbert, and Rio Salado, yet they are asking for a transcript from Phoenix college. I never attended that institution, and I even called and asked if they had a record of me attending and they do not. I am talking to an admission advisor about all of this but they don\u2019t really seem to understand why the system is showing that, and they are relying on me to make phone calls and figure it out. I just don\u2019t know what to do at this point. If I don\u2019t get enrolled by the end of May, I will get fired. I feel like my only hope is to talk to a supervisor at my work and see if they can give me an extension or something, but I\u2019ve heard they are pretty strict about school and interns. I\u2019m just wondering is anyone else encountered this scenario and if they have any advice!",

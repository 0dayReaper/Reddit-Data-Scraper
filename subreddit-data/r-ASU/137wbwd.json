The bass hat crew is just the slightly older high school mimicry crew that hasn\u2019t matured and moved onto the next behavior to mimic. As people get older, the mimicry will become more existential in nature. Nothing wrong with it, it\u2019s a an evolutionary and social phenomenon meant to ensure survival. We all do it to some extent, some much more so than others. Those who happen to notice it, (my opinion here) do so as a result of greater internal conflict between higher-functioning consciousness and the innate need to fit in with those around you.",

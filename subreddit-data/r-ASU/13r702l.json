    "postText": "We're looking for 2-3 people to come join our Table Top Role Playing group. We play online on our Discord Server every Wednesday, from 7pm-10pm. We play mostly Pathfinder and a few other games, like Monster of the Week. We\u2019re a friendly group who have been together for a few years and are just looking to expand our ranks. If you're interested, please DM me with the following information:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Name we will call you.\n\n\\- Location (State, City, that kind of jazz, we just need to know what region and time zones we're talking.) \r  \n\r\n\n \\- Are you an Experienced or Inexperienced Player, and if so, with what systems? (If you're Inexperienced, all the better; we like teaching and we can corrupt you that much quicker.) \r  \n\r  \n\\- Do you like anime? (The weebier you are, the more you'll like us.) \r  \n\r  \n\\- A little about yourself. We're all friends, and we'd like you to be one too. If you're socially awkward, perfect, join the club, we make the jackets. Chances are we'll hit you up outside the game to chat as we get more comfortable with you, so don't expect just to see us during game time.",

It kicked me out bc I got calc 1 credit so I emailed my advisor and luckily she was awake probably bc she was also dealing w bs enrollment issues. She overrided me into a good calc 2 professor that fit my schedule perfectly\n\nYou may get your credit to come in late and this will happen but you might also get it earlier which then you just tell your advisor and they can most likely help you out by overriding it",

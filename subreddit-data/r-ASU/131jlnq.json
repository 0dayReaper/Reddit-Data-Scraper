    "postText": "I just graduated with a BA in Psychology last December. Unfortunately I didn't get any research experience because for the last couple years, all research at my school got suspended. Some opened recently but got entirely booked. Plus, since I was living paycheck to paycheck, it was really hard for me to sacrifice income for research experience.\n\nNow that I'm much better financially, I can finally look into grad schools. My professor highly recommended me to apply for phd programs since that's my end goal. She said it wasn't impossible to get into a phd program without the experience but definitely hard...so she said if I wanted to, I could apply to both masters and phd programs this year (just to see what I get) or take a year off and do research. I've emailed a couple research lab opportunities and waiting to hear back. \n\nI was looking into the Psychology MS program and was really interested... however, my heart still really wants to skip the masters and go straight into a phd program (due to money and also because I'm eager + my professor's rec). Since I will be applying to a few phd programs along with other masters programs, I thought about applying to the phd program at ASU.. However, is there a chance they would soft reject me and offer me admission to their masters program instead? Or will they just full on deny me. I know the application deadlines are different so I'm scared of applying for the phd program knowing I'm not extremely competitive just to lose my chances entirely.",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t think so. A master\u2019s program and a PhD program typically use completely different admissions committees since the process is so different. For instance I\u2019m applying for a dual MA/JD program. I have to apply to each program separately and get accepted into each program in order to do the dual program. If I\u2019m accepted into the Master\u2019s program I have to send proof of my acceptance to the JD admissions committee. So my advice would be to apply to both. If one says no at least you could have the other and hopefully it may work in your favor.",

The program I worked for did, and some of our faculty even encouraged promising  applicants with less experience to apply directly to the PhD, knowing that in a particularly competitive application cycle you might not be able to make the PhD cut, but you could be admitted to the masters. I'd suggest contacting the graduate coordinator in the psychology department, or the faculty member with whom you wish to work.",

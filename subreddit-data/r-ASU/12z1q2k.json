I'm in engineering not business but networking always goes a long way. Oftentimes student associations will invite companies to meetings and they'll announce internship positions available. If you want specific areas, look at companies/firms that have regional offices/headquarters in that area. Also get your resume reviewed, companies may also have mock interviews and resume workshops at these student meetings. They do this with engineering clubs all the time so it would really surprise me if business clubs don't get a similar experience.",

I\u2019ve had a hard time getting out of state internships (most companies don\u2019t want to pay relocation, transportation, etc). I did sign an offer for this summer though none of the expenses are paid. I think in your situation if you are local to the Bay Area and housing/commuting isn\u2019t a problem you may have a good chance",

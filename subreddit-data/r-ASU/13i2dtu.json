            "comment": "In my experience, MSE mainly focuses on solids and their properties (electronic, optical, mechanical, etc.) and how to process/characterize them. They love to use the \"material tetrahedron\" - Structure, Properties, Performance, Processing, with Characterization in the center.\n\nMy roommate who was CHE said they had a lot more related to processing, fluids, and reactor design.\n\nJob out looks are great for both.\n\nMSE - semiconductor, aerospace, sustainability jobs\n\nCHE - semiconductor, oil, pharmaceutical jobs",

We learned more about kinetics of growth and how to achieve certain properties via processing.\n\nThere will be some chemistry (physics would be a better description) when evaluating electron levels and behavior with quantum dynamics.",

            "comment": "They can both get you into pretty much any industry you want to work in. Materials Science and Engineering is relatively a new field and not all major universities have an MSE program but it fills the gap between a Chemical Engineer and Mechanical Engineer since typically those engineers were tasked with doing materials analysis. Think of MSE as more of the chemistry and physical properties of materials whereas ChemE is more of the transport processes, kinetics, and thermodynamics of chemical systems plus reactors and separation systems. \n\nChemE in general deals with more fluids since historically a large employer of ChemEs has been the petroleum industry but chemical engineers end up pretty much all over the place now. In Arizona, semiconductors are among the largest employers of ChemEs and Intel has typically been a huge industry player in offering internships+jobs to ASU students. With the TSMC and other semiconductor manufacturers growing in the state along with the CHIPS Act it's safe to assume the semiconductor industry is a safe bet. If you're not into semiconductors, I have ChemE friends or acquaintances in pharmaceuticals, engineering construction, cosmetics, pet food, agriculture, consulting, food processing/manufacturing, chemical manufacturing (industrial/household), water treatment, solar power production, process control systems, aerospace/defense, and probably more that I can't recall.\n\nMaterials engineering can get you into very similar jobs and industries, the only difference would be what you're tasked in doing. You won't necessarily be expected to be a process engineer, for example. The few MSE students I know got internships or jobs at some of the same companies ChemEs went into.",

This seems like a logistical challenge that shouldn\u2019t happen, and I\u2019m not sure what led to this and if it\u2019s a common thing or that was j last year for whatever reason. \n\nAll in all I\u2019d do your best to keep bugging housing until you can confirm you have a room assignment. Bc from what I heard dorms are better than the hotels. In addition you won\u2019t get the entire dorm experience if you\u2019re j chillen in a hotel.",

As long as you signed the housing agreement by 5/15, you are guaranteed some type of housing. If you signed after 5/15, nothing is guaranteed anymore. \n\nMany students that wait until after 4/30 don't hear about their placement until late July. Some don't even hear until the week before move-in. In past years, many ended up placed in hotels pending other students dropping and a room opening. That's why housing is no longer guaranteed after 5/15. However, not hearing until late July is the norm.",

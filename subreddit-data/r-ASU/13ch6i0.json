But pairing any major with one in engineering is going to add significant time to your grad plan. \n\nIf you are finding that you don\u2019t like the intensity of the coding in CS and want to pursue something more business related, then you could look at CIS. \n\nOtherwise, if you want to keep CS and have something business like as a supplement, I recommend either the Business minor or the Applied Business Data Analysis certificate. Those won\u2019t add a ton of classes, but you\u2019ll have dipped your toes into another focus.",

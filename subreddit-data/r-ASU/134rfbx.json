I've had students try to put me on blast and they have the wrong course number. Yeah, there's probably a reason why they didn't do well in my course.",

I\u2019ve never been in a situation where I am like, \u2018damn I got a low grade I\u2019m destroy this professor on RMP\u2019. Not like it matters cause no professor is looking at it anyway :/",

My favorites are when I have an online course that I didn't design (which I'm quite clear about in the course) and I get blasted for shit I have no control over. It's rate my professor, not rate my course. Sometimes good profs have to teach shit courses, either because it's poorly designed or because some classes just aren't terribly fun nor interesting.",

So it's pretty much going to require the same stats as getting into a prestigious school without any of the reputation. I'm super in love with their program but I likely will not get in so an ASU program would be a saving grace.",

It has a different faculty, curriculum, residency match lists, applications (even completely different admissions criteria that leads to more Californian students), it just shares the same umbrella of UA.

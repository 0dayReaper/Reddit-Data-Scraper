Mainly, not using your phone or someone isn't there helping you out taking it.  Some classes will be open notes, some classes will be no notes allowed.  You will know if you've done something if your test ends or your screen turns a different color.  Usually, the person watching you is telling you to stop doing something like show your face on the camera or move your computer because the light is too bright or dark.",

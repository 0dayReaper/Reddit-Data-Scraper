I read \"most\" post 8 to 10 days but I need to submit something to my work for a promotion and I'm getting impatient. I have a werid fear ASU will come back and say I am missing  something and I have to take more classes (my DARS is all green now)",

I am worried it pulled too many classes from cc transfer or something. I have checked in with advisors many times along the way and it has never been mentioned but yeah anxiety",

They should be able to look into it.\n\nI had credit transfer over from AP exams I took in high school and honestly, I think they made a mistake! They gave me 3 extra credits for something.",

Check your unofficial transcript and it may show that your degree is listed on there already since the conferral date was last Monday. You will only get an email once your physical degree is getting prepared/mailed but won't for anything else. When I graduated they also offered a protected pdf e-diploma like a few weeks after graduation for like $5 or something and some people I knew got it to show their employers they got their degree. Your myasu will also switch as have a Congrats! banner with confetti and will have alumni info where your program info used to be.",

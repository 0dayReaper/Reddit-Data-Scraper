            "comment": "Either way the class will count toward your degree. Gen Eds are just as required as your major courses. You may want to consider if your major has any prerequisite classes that would prevent you from taking any major required classes. For example college algebra is needed for higher level math. What I would do is take as many ULC classes as you can as they are a reduced rate compared to regular ASU tuition.",

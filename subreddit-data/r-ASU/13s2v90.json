    "postText": "Hey guys I am heading towards my last year into college and I\u2019m now starting to get into working on my honors thesis. I have an idea of what I want to do with my internship. My goal is to create a video series about HPV awareness and the science behind it. But I don\u2019t know if that makes for a good project. I wanted to know if anyone could tell me the kinds of projects you worked on or what you did to make your thesis?",

            "comment": "Lots to unpack here. \n\n1. Don't overthink this. The thesis is an opportunity for you to do something that you otherwise wouldn't get to do. It's also something that you and your director agree on. A \"good\" project is something you both are happy to pursue. They help set the standards and expectations. But at face value, this seems like a workable project. \n\n2. Find a director asap. Someone who is interested in HPV or health policy/education (or related fields) in general.\n\n3. \"HPV awareness and the science behind it\" is a vague statement. The science behind HPV or that behind why some people are (or are not) aware of it. \n\n4. From my experience as a thesis director, a \"creative\" project (such as videos) will also require a written narrative framing the problem and discussing the creative choices made. \n\n5. Not sure how this relates to an internship. \n\n\nHope this helps a little.",

Rather, we are doing it out of the goodness of our heart (and our own free time). Pleases and thank you's are very helpful.\n\nI second this so much. Thesis committee members do this because we want to help you, not because of any $$$ or kudos we get.",

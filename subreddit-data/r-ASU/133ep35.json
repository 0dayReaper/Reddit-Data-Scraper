    "postText": "now that we're wrapping up the school year, I'd like to start looking at clubs and orgs I could join in the fall. I tried a few clubs for this semester (I had a blast with the ASU outdoors club, but was only able to make it to one trip) but the rest were kinda duds \n\nI'm really just looking for some groups of people I can kinda hang with, nothing too serious-- I'm already looking at a few Finance career-centered clubs, and Fluent fridays looks really cool, but beyond this I'd love to find something a little more lowkey that doesn't require too much brain power haha\n\nI'm really just trying to find new ways to spend my free time that don't involve party-hopping (I dont mind drinking, but I def prefer to keep things lowkey-- I get exhausted kinda quick around ASU party crowds haha)\n\nI thought about joining a Business frat after a good friend of mine gave a glowing review, but it seems like a really big commitment; not really sure if its worth it for my purposes \n\nI've been putting in random keywords in the sundevilsync club search bar but dont really know where to start/what to look for-- anyone have any suggestions? Honestly anything outdoors-y would be great, but I also play video games, watch some shows, and am always down to try new things",

            "comment": "TAMID Group might be a good fit for a low key finance club. The club is mostly business students, and has two \u201csides\u201d: Fund and Consulting. Members join one or both.\n\nThe Fund team make stock pitches, and half or more are finance majors. There\u2019s a lot of new members currently and fund has grown a lot in the past two semesters, so there may be less pressure to put in a lot of work if you\u2019re worried.\n\nConsulting is what I did; it\u2019s where a team of us consult for a startup. The workload varies, but it\u2019s usually low with one client call per week if not every other, and an hour or two of client work each week.\n\nSocial events are mostly low key hangouts which give it a business frat feel.\n\nBut the best part is that the club is pretty new (good leadership opportunities if you want it), and the current leadership are great people who like fun and aren\u2019t so serious.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, the club tables at I-Week and has an application process each semester.",

There was just a conference in San Francisco like 2 weeks ago. It's more geared for polisci peeps interested in international relations. We usually host a conference in the fall to help fundraise for travel and hotel to the two conferences and sweep awards there hehe.",

The officers are super fun and it's kind of refreshing to just stick your hands in the dirt once a week lol. It's definitely a social club, but there are fun activities and you get to eat whatever you harvest from the garden! \n\n\nI also love the arizona outdoors club. You can always host your own trips if you can't make the ones others plan!",

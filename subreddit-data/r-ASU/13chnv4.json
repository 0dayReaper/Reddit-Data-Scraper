            "comment": "They give you cords based on your GPA when you pick them up. Way before final grades are posted for the final semester. If your GPA rises to the next level after final grades are posted you can swap them out. If your GPA falls to the lower level after final grades are posted it\u2019s not like they can take them away from you.",

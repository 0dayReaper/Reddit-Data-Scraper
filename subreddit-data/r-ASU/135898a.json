So the likely hood of having small children/families/other responsibilities is higher.\nThis says non-urgent issues.  As someone who took classes while working 40 hr/we with 3 littles, stuff happens.  This is to help you think about situations that could arise, like a little not going to sleep at their regular time and cutting into your school time.\nIf someone is in the hospital, urgently I'll, or along those lines, ASU has policies and guidelines for both students and faculty.  Example: I was admitted to the hospital for 9 days that coved finals week one year.",

I think they were likely trying to get at encouraging students to be proactive and not wait until the last minute to do coursework, because you really never know what can happen. Where an in-person student might have something come up that prevents them from making it to class, as an Online student you will experience some point in time where live throws a small curveball and you need to have a plan. \n\nSo, the intent is good, but the way it\u2019s coming across is not great. I think EdPlus needs to rethink how this is presented.",

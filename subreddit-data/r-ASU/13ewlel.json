    "postText": "I\u2019m double majoring in political science and economics, but want to switch my political science major to a finance major for more job security. If we\u2019re being realistic though, is it really hard to do this, in which I\u2019ll be double majoring in both, and it\u2019s going to be not only a lot of coursework, but as well as a lot of quantitative work. I still want to do this but a lot of close friends have tried to switch me to do this and I want to know if it\u2019s something worth to do or not. Please be honest in replying about your opinions on this.",

            "comment": "Depends on how many classes the majors share imo. Lots of people in my accounting classes were accounting &amp; finance majors simply because you only need to take an extra couple finance classes to get that degree. \n\nEcon and finance will share a couple requirements, but either way it should not be too hard if you manage your time well and prioritize your studies.",

So the Econ major through CLAS really emphasizes the ECN courses. \n\nThe Econ major through WPC (as well as all the other BS and BA majors) require students to complete 8 skills courses, 7-8 core courses, a SOC course, PSY course, and COM course. This is all required because you have to have a general knowledge base in business (and they have to require this content for their accreditation). If you don\u2019t have any of those courses even started, you can end up adding a lot of summer courses and even a semester or two to your graduation plan. \n\nI think it would be an excellent idea to meet with a WPC advisor to talk through your situation and what you would have to do to add Finance as a major. Running a What-If DARS for Finance would be helpful to do before you meet with the advisor as well.",

I already talked to a WPC advisor about this situation with substituting my poli sci major with an actual business degree, and gave me a plan of the classes I would have to take each semester. And yes, it would add another year for me until I graduate. I\u2019m taking CIS this summer, that way I can take my acc credits this year, and classes like LES/MKT alongside my ECN credits.",

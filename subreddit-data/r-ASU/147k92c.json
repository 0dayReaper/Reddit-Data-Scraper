            "comment": "Hi, if anybody is thinking of living at District next year, please PM me! I'm looking to transfer my lease for the 2023 to 2024 year. There's no security deposit. This is for a 4x4 Private Room, Private Bath with 3 male roommates.\r  \n\r  \nThis room at District has sold out and is cheaper than the only 2 floor plans that they have available. While the rent is high ($1545 a month), it is lower than what District currently offers for their other options. This is the rate that District is making me transfer at. If you are not interested because of that price, that is completely understandable. With that being said, I greatly appreciate if anybody is interested in taking this over, as I am trying to get it off of my hands. Thank you very much.",

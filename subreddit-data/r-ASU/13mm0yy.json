    "postText": "Hello, I'm an incoming freshman majoring in CS. One of my main ec's in high school has been research, and I'd like to continue going forward. I'll also be trying to transfer after my first year so having ec's in college is pretty important for me. \n\nDoes pursuing research get much easier if I'm an honors student? Till now I was thinking that it wasn't worth the extra load, but if it provides better opportunities I'll be fine with it. I got into the GCSP program but it seems pretty confusing and I'm not sure if I want to attend, because there is a lot of fluff stuff in it. \n\nBefore coming to college, is it alright to contact professors who I'd like to work with? Not exactly asking for a position, but just introducing myself and discussing their work. \n\nThanks for reading, any answers are appreciated!",

I found GCSP to be a colossal waste of time (others disagree- it's subjective), but this was also because I was constantly pursuing other research opportunities.\n\nBarrett makes it EXTREMELY easy for you to pursue research - and non Barrett kids will refuse to tell you that because it's true that you can technically get the same opportunities, but with increased difficulty without paying the Barrett fees (2000/yr). Barrett kids always get the priority, and my Tooker friends continually ask me to refer them- which I have and that's how they have secured their opportunities.\n\nThe Barrett Undergraduate Research Fellows is an amazing program. My friend is literally heading to Germany and pursuing a grad level course as a rising Sophomore because of the research he was chosen for under this program.\n\nI myself have researched under a Nobel Laureate, and my research atm has been selected for a coveted think tank workshop in DC that I'll be attending. I got these opportunities because of Barrett and its Honors Digest.\n\nIf you are here for research, join Barrett and ignore those who ask against it- they aren't in Barrett.",

            "comment": "I am not in Barrett but I know a lot of STEM majors in Barrett and I am in GCSP so here's my braindump as a rising senior and fulton student:\n\nFrom what I've heard about Barrett, it can be hard to feel like you're part of the community or that professors/advisors care just bc there's so many students just like you. If you have a strong freshman year experience w leadership experience and stick with it after the first few years, maybe you won't have that experience but I also know many people who were the over-achieving student leaders who still felt that way, so it just depends on if you get noticed I guess. \n\nIn my experience in GCSP, my interest in the program honestly has fluctuated a lot as my interests and priorities has changed. Research is a huge focus that they want students to get, so they will definitely help there plus as a smaller program you'll get more individual help from the professors/advisors. They even have student jobs available such as TAs, student leaders, camp counselors, etc. that you can get involved in as soon as spring semester your first year! I was a student leader for half a semester tho and the stipend pay was so not worth the time and energy included, so unless they make the pay hourly or worth more than hourly I would just focus on the competencies and any events where you can network with people who can help you get research/internships. \n\nAny college experience you pursue is going to only be as helpful and rewarding as the amount of effort you put into it and how passionate you actually are about it. I signed up for a ton of stuff coming into ASU as a freshman and while I did find out quickly what I do/do not enjoy, I definitely got burnt out quickly and had a hard time learning to say no to things when I had too much on my plate. As a CS major at ASU tho I'd also recommend finding non-technical experiences or social clubs with other CS/STEM majors (greek life, coalitions, etc) to broaden your leadership/people skills and network with people! I got more career help from networking with sorority alumni/dates within my major than GCSP or even my colleges' career fair but it varies from person to person whether you like being a social butterfly or don't know what to start conversations with people about other than school/computers which is also totally fine and you'll definitely find tons of opportunities at ASU either way.",

Is it worth the time I have left or should I just finish the degree and pursue in MS in stats?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated:)",

But i took a handful of ML classes at ASU as part of undergrad+grad program and that stuff didn't matter as much. Definitely having a stats background will help, the coding was mostly python numpy and stuff so that's what you'll need to get better at. Tests didn't really involve coding either.\n\nMaybe consider taking some CS 4XX ML classes as electives",

I dropped my CS double major as a Finance major because the CS courses here are pretty behind the times. I picked up DS as a minor. If you can't do DS then maybe CS makes sense, but it is hell, trust me. Some of the professors (I'm looking at you, Prof. Carter) are abhorrently unaware of current tech trends, and there's no avoiding it. You will end up doing coursework that should have been stricken from the curriculum a decade ago.",

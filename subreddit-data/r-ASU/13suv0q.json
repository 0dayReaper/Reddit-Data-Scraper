Some topics that we always suggest our interns learn in parallel on their own include:\n- mastery of source control best practices \n- understanding and proficiency (u&amp;p) of CI/CD and DevOps\n- u &amp; p of micro-services and event driven architectures\n-  agile team methodologies and how to operate in them\n- u &amp; p of at least one major cloud stack. The rest are easier after you learn one\n- take some time to read about emotional IQ. \n- base understanding of core AI/ML concepts. This topic just keeps getting hotter. Sometimes you need it just to educate a leader who was just promised the magic solution by some vendor\n- base understanding of security best practices and then dive into some of the specifics of the area you want to get into.\n\nYou are signing up to be a life-long learner when you go into an IT related field. Hopefully that idea excites you.",

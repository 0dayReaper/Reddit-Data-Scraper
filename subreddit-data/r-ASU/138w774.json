    "postText": "For Fall 23 I selected the following classes:\n\nCSE 509 - Digital Video Processing (Staff)\nCSE 536 - Advanced Operating Systems (Ahmad)\nCSE 598 - Topic: Hardware Security and Trust (Kinsy) (This was a mandatory course because of the lab I'm working in)\n\nMost classes are full so there isn't much room to change. But I've considered swapping with either CSE 522 - Real Time Embedded Systems (Staff) or CSE 545: Software Security (Fish Wang)\n\nCould I get your advice?",

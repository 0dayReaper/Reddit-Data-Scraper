So would the grant money still be applied in this case? I also heard about some some type of form that I can fill out to get my fin aid early since I\u2019m using Chap 33 benefits. Do you know anything about that?",

I haven't heard about that or done that. Your question would be better asked to the Patt Tillman center, they can give you the most accurate answers for your situation",

At the end of the day, ASU is going to make sure they get paid back, so they will apply it to what you owe first, regardless of the VA confirms that they will pay before the end of the semester",

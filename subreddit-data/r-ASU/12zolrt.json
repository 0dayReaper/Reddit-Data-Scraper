    "postText": "Hi all, I'm approaching my last year at ASU and need to take a few more electives in order to graduate. I am deciding between a few UD HU courses and then need an UD credit (C or SB) for the fall. I've listed what I'm considering below and am hoping for some input if any of you have taken any of these courses. I have some difficult classes in the fall so am looking for \"easier\" courses to lighten my coursework load while still completing the required UD credits. \n\nI am a BS Biochemistry major, but don't really care if the classes are related. I'm looking more for a lighter load in terms of coursework, or if there is a lot of work for it to at least be interesting! I've already skimmed through and selected what seems mildly interesting but any input helps. Thank you!!!\n\n  \n\nFMP 403: Independent Film (HU)\n\nMUS 362: Rap Music and Hip Hop Culture (HU)\n\nPHI 320: Bioethics (HU)\n\nREL 320: American Religious Traditions\n\nTHE 430: History of Fashion I",

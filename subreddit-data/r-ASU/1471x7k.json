Also, most places close by will already be booked for fall 2023, if that\u2019s when you\u2019re interested in leasing. \n\nIf you\u2019re set on an apartment, your best bet is to look at places farther away and plan on commuting, whether that be via light rail or car. \n\nIf you are open to living in a house, you can always look on Facebook marketplace for rentals. You can also post on all of the the ASU roommate facebook groups and you may find someone looking to fill 2 beds in a house. Just be careful of scams and never send anyone money without seeing the property. Good luck!",

Nothing is gonna be less than 1200 (1 room in a 4 bed is 1400 down the road from me rn). \n\nGet a student pass for valley metro prolly",

    "postText": "As a freshman, I was looking for new clubs and organizations at ASU.\n\"Sun Devil Survivor\" caught my attention quickly. Little did I know, they were a part of a bigger group, Hope Church. \nThings were fine at first, I had a good time at the Sun Devil Survivor events. But I noticed one thing, most of the friends I made there all went to church together. Lonely, and looking for something to do, I joined them for Sunday service. \n\nHere's what happened after. \nI was immediately pressured to join Bible study groups, where I was pried to give information about my personal life. Sometimes, they wanted me to reveal information in front of people I was not comfortable with. \n\nWhat did they want me to talk about? \nThey constantly asked me about my sex life, going as far as to ask the names of the girls I was with (it wasn't relevant) and asking them what specifically happened during the encounters. Yes, they asked me what sexual acts were performed. A simple, \"I had sex\" was not good enough. They wanted intimate, perverted details. \n\nThey also always tried to bring up my masterbation habits, even though I made it clear to them I didn't want to talk about it. \n\nThe worst part was when they pressured me to talk about my mental illness, once again, in front of people I didn't know or felt comfortable with. They knew I was vulnerable after I was hospitalized a few weeks prior. Sharing your trauma was a competition for them, people who told the most about their past were praised. In fact, they have videos almost every Sunday highlighting people's \"journey to find Christ.\" Forcing people to share their traumatic events just so they could be a member of the church is emotionally abusive and manipulative. \n\n\nI can also confirm what you might have heard before, yes they do stalk you (online and in person) to get as many details as they can about your personal life. After I was caught holding hands with a girl, I was immediately confronted and questioned about my intentions with her the next day. \nI felt none of this was warranted at all. \nThey wanted to control every aspect of my life. \n\nSo why am I writing this? \nBecause people still join and are taken advantage of on the ASU Tempe campus. \nThe worst part is that people will defend them, saying, \"well some of them are nice.\"\n\n\nI don't care. They want to manipulate you. They want to control your life. Even if they are nice to you personally, they continue to be a part of a group that has stalked, hazed, and taken advantage of others. \n\nI'm absolutely tired of seeing people defend them after what they have done to me and countless others. \n\nI'm posting this because I finally wanted to share my story. If someone is reading this and then subsequently decides to quit Hope Church, then that's the only difference I need to make.",

They demonized me for that, and at events I was invited just to awkwardly be by myself. As a Christian I felt like wtf? So I much for brotherhood they claimed. The final straw is when they questioned my faith for me being so closed off. They have no idea what I\u2019ve gone through and my relationship with god is my own business.

Sharing collaborating all with the same goal:  get more people to buy into becoming a guardian and sharing profits etc. \n\nThat is all too eerily similar to how  Sorenson is portrayed as an innovator and revolutionary for the church.\n\nPlus he was in a faith based rock band. We all know the god complex musicians can get when they gather all that adoration.\n\nLook I'm not saying Sorensen is secretly in bed with the MyPillow CEO and other zealots with a plan to fill their wallets from the masses of mentally unwell who seek acceptance through faith.

I don't think this is really the time or place to push basic beliefs and theology further, sometimes the best thing we can do is love people where they're at and acknowledge that jumping right back into organized religion is a lot more difficult than just \"we aren't all like this\". Just saying that I don't think this is an issue of other people not being tolerant as much as the basic belief spiel not really being the best method to share the love of Christ here.",

I've been apart of the church on and off, and never experienced prying when I made it obvious I was not willing to go further with details. I dealt with most of the staff there and they were always nothing but kind and loving. I no longer attend regularly there, but I'm still friends with several of the guys that still attend regularly, some of which are now staff members. Which in my experience is strange, only because typically churches are very careful about who they allow to be in pay roll, mainly because of the possible reputation a person may have or bring. \n\nIt may help to add that I am a Christian and was long before I began attending Hope. I butted heads several times with the guy mentoring me on the ways they sometimes went about things, so it wasn't all awesome. But for the most part I have nothing but good things to say about them. The prying for specific details is unacceptable. If they were interested in swaying your world view there are several other avenues to use that I see used elsewhere that work far better. Apologies for your experiences mate. I hate to hear that your views on Jesus have been destroyed by a religious organization. Best of luck in the future!",

I dont see anything wrong with people posting their GPAs because it is a lot of hard work. It might hurt to see it (that's how I felt before), but there is also an amazing and supportive community at ASU that does want people to succeed. \n\nTo anyone who didn't do as well as they hoped- I sincerely hope the next semester can go well for you. If you did well- congrats and keep it up!",

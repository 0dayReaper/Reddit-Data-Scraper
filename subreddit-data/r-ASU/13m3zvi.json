    "postText": "In order to take a summer course at my community college, and transfer the credit back to ASU I need to fill out a \"permission to enroll\" form from ASU and then send it to my community college\n\nAfter looking around though, I can't find any information about this on any ASU website. How exactly am I supposed to do this? The class I want to take only has 3 seats open so I'm kinda in a rush at the moment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApparently most schools have a PDF form that can be filled out and emailed to the community college. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!",

So community colleges usually have a prerequisite override form but since your prerequisite were probably taken at ASU like mine were what I did was contact an advisor at the community college and told them the class info I wanted to be enroll in at there college and attached my ASU unofficial transcript to the email.",

Roommate and I most likely will lower the price of our 2 bed 2 bath apartment from the original $2k to $1k or something just since we won\u2019t be there due to other obligations. Sadly ending our lease early is like $5k in fees and rent so I think it\u2019s best if I go this route. Right across from Tempe campus, let me know if anyone is interested",

Recently I got cold feet about the whole thing and I\u2019m transferring my credits to a local university where I\u2019m from. I was stupid though and signed a lease early for a place because of how insane the housing is in Tempe. I\u2019m now trying to find someone to take over the lease for me. It\u2019s at the Gateway at Tempe complex and it\u2019s 850 a month. If anyone knows someone interested just comment or message me. Suggestions on where to post something like this would also be appreciated as I\u2019ve never done this before\ud83d\ude02. Thanks",

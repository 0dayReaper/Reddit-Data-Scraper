    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am trying to find a good and fun informatics elective before I graduate. I can only take one more elective. Does anyone have any suggestions for any classes? It\u2019s a plus if the class is easy but I am looking to actually learn something with a fair grading policy. The one thing I don\u2019t enjoy are essays but I can deal with them.\n\nCurrently I am deciding between CSE 360 (Intro to software engineering), CSE 434 (Computer Networks) or Upper Division Elective with Mobile dev as a focus.\n\nI have heard bad things about Lynn Carter for CSE 360 and Violet Syrotiuk for CSE 434. Unfortunately, they are the only professors available for next semester.\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations? It can be an Upper Division AME, CPI or CSE class.\n\nThank you!",

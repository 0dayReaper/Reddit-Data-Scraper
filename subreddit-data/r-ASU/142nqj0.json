    "postText": "Hi, I had a question about transferring a course. Here, we see that the \"ASU Equivalent Course\" is both CSE 360 and EEE Department Elective. If I need credit specifically for CSE 360, would I need to worry about it potentially transferring as the elective credit instead? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2j30wy1qf4b1.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b808c0380ea0b1e891438df0bda6e2cea206963c\n\n  \nThank you!",

I had done both during my time at ASU.  The courses have to be organized in special ways for both situations.  I feel really bad for the students who were forced into transitioning to online versions of their courses.\n\nWhat worries me is that I am now a professor with the Maricopa Community College System and if they choose to hold classes online, my classes are going to get canceled.  The type of course I teach cannot be successfully implemented in an online format.\n\nWhile this definitely sucks for me, my students come first, second, and third IMO.   I'm just crossing my fingers that it will workout in August.",

I don't know if I have an opinion per say on which classes are best in-person.  I would look at which classes you would feel you would benefit from having your fellow classmates together in the classroom so you can bounce ideas off each other in real time.  \n\nHonestly, all classes are better in-person because you can get instant feedback and help navigate the lesson through the ability to immediately ask questions to the professor.\n\nThe icourse I took last semester wasn't really an issue for me substance wise, but the technology was ridiculous.  None of the outside platforms worked the first time and I had not been registered properly by the professor.",

For all we know, they're playing their cards like everything will be in person for now so they can secure their finances. It's possible, although I'm not sure how probable, that once the tuition/fees deadline has passed they will switch everything back to online again. That way they maximize enrollment (because if they say they're going to for sure be online, I think a lot of incoming students would take the community college path), get money not just for tuition but also for housing and meal plans, and then close down services, which both gets students off campus, reducing potential liabilities the university could face, and saves money by not having to keep certain things up and running. \n\nIn brief, there's a lot they could be doing, and only time will tell what their actual stance is. Personally, I think it would be suicide in terms of public relations for them to take the path I described, but if there's one thing I've learned after three years at ASU, it's that people tend to stop making sensible (and in some cases, eithical) choices once they get even the tiniest bit of power.",

Just imagine how bad it would be if they move in 20,000 students then a month later force them out. \n\nBetween the dining halls, the residence halls, 100 people in a lecture all; all social distancing is out the window. Not to mention off campus parties, etc. We can\u2019t get people to stop partying when this is fresh. You can\u2019t even imagine how bad it\u2019s gonna be in October or December.",

            "comment": "In some variation, these are people who at their core believe others to be commodities and little else. But I'm specifically making this comment because I'm also a Boilermaker and I have two GOP governors on my diploma.\n\nMitch Daniels should be regarded with the same level of disdain and resentment that most of us now hold for Reagan and both Bushs, particularly the latter. He spends his commencement speeches telling students to not be such snowflakes and other right-wing chud rhetoric, knowing full well that those same students are largely ignorant to the fact that the very same Daniels pushed completely medically unnecessary mood stabilizers at Eli Lilly. Only a neo-con like Daniels would prance about without the slightest hint of irony that his student body are the same people he pushed pills to during his private sector career.\n\nHe also wanted to ban Howard Zinn books and privatized the toll roads that have since been managed by bankruptcy after bankruptcy. I could go on, but in Crow's book, he talks about how what Daniels is doing is a good thing, because these people don't see universities like you and I might. \n\nDaniels was going to be made Purdue president months before his 2nd term for governor was up. Purdue paid a search firm at least six figures to apparently convince Daniels to take the job, but it was obvious from his visits to campus that this was a done deal before any of that came out. It was just another cheap grift.\n\nHe replaced NASA's France Cordova, a very qualified and respected president, because Purdue was upset that she lacked fundraising power. Of course Daniels would never have that problem because he has made generations of right-wing neo-con connections, and also had control over state budgets so that when k-12 and higher ed is inevitably gutted to 'balance the budget' (Hoosiers LOVED Daniels for this), the consent is already manufactured for someone like Daniels to come in and make deals so that he can sell off the university piece by piece to the highest corporate bidder while funding day to day operations with Chinese out-of-state tuition (4,000 of Purdue's 40,000 on-campus students were out of state Chinese students, a whopping 10%, when I graduated around 2013).",

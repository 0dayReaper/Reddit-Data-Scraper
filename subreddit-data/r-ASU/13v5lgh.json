My schedule is full as it is and adding Spanish or something would not be ideal. Anything else I can do?",

Or you could take it at a community college and have the credits transfer. But if you need them for your degree you won\u2019t get the degree until you complete them.",

If you\u2019ve not yet been admitted then a community college foreign language (4 credits) can substitute for the HS requirement. If you\u2019ve already been admitted and you\u2019re thinking of adding it to your college schedule: if it\u2019s not required for your degree and you don\u2019t want to take it then don\u2019t.",

I would knock them out back to back though with doing A &amp; B sessions for an entire school year.",

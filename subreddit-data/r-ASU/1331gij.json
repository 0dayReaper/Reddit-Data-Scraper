My curiosity given my situation is:\n\nHow good/ legitimate is computer science online?\n\nIs it still good enough to score internships?\n\nPlease pass onto me your wisdom",

You would be surprised how many CS grads walk out of school and go do all the algorithms and data structures and know them in and out, but have no intuition of high level architecture. Pay attention to Professor Mehlhase and when she talks about architecture and design patterns. Getting a mind for high level architecture can set you apart.\n\nProfessor Suthar classes suck. He will ignore the existence of the class about a week in to the semester. So be prepared for that. You will also be lucky not to have to go through a famous Javier Gonzalez Sanchez Intro to Programming Languages. Or shouldn't have to. According to the students I've talked to who are currently early in the program, he isn't teach it anymore.",

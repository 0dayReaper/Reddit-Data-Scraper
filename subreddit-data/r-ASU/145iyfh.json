The caveat is the surface pro feels more like a windows laptop with tablet as an after thought but the pencil functionality is excellent and being it uses a full windows operating system does not limit you in the way of software and power.",

OneNote is fantastic for in-class note taking though. Lastly, I tried a couple different pens and had the best performance from the Microsoft slim pen, truly a seamless writing experience.",

Base storage is 128gb but can be expanded with a Micro SD card. The screen is amazing and is available in 3 different sizes 11, 12.4 and  14.6 inches. It's cheaper than a Surface too. I would consider it if you already have a laptop and need it more as a companion device. If you are looking for a full laptop/tablet capabilities than a Surface pro would be better. Or even a Surface Pro Studio.",

The DARs system was telling me a few months ago that I didn't have credits for a genetics course when I had taken and passed the class at ASU. I had to have that manually added and corrected in the report. The same thing happened when ASU replaced the biology courses with 181 and 182 I believe, I had to have those manually entered as well",

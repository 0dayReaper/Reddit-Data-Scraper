    "postText": "Hi y\u2019ll,\nI\u2019m an international student, currently a freshman at Arizona State University pursuing computer science. I was admitted to the university of Virginia college of arts and sciences as a sophomore with no scholarship. I\u2019m interested in consulting/investment banking as well as software engineering.\n\nASU - 20,000 tuition plus living around 10-15,000 yearly \n\nUVA - 50,000 tuition plus living around 10-15,000 yearly\n\nFurthermore , I gave 6 APs so I have around 23 transferred credits at ASU, helping me to graduate in another 2 years instead of 3 and saving me another 30 grand. In short I\u2019m paying an additional 60 grand to graduate from ASU in 2 years and have to pay 170 grand to graduate from UVA in 3 years. I\u2019ve already paid 35 grand to ASU.\n\nI do plan on applying to Mcintire school of commerce (UVA undergrad business school) as a third year student which has 63 percent acceptance rate and places well into top firms (according to my research).\n\nIs paying around 170 grand for UVA tag worth it and will it pay in the long run or should I stick to ASU and forget about the prestige or think about going to a top school for masters or MBA?",

            "comment": "Two thoughts...\n\n1) If you pursue computer engineering the choice of school seems to have much less impact on recruiting and future earnings. The demand to supply ratio is so much more favorable for engineering than for investment banking that school choice doesn't matter as much. A few select schools give you an edge (Stanford and MIT) but generally hell no don't take 100k in debt.\n\n\n\n2) Can't speak to investment banking recruiting. My impression is that there are far fewer hires in that field so they might have more of a school specific recruiting pattern but don't know. See if there's a reddit forum for investment banking and lob the question out to them - would they pay 100k for a UVA degree over an ASU degree if they were trying to get recruited. If you get a RESOUNDING yes, then consider it. If the answers are anything less than resounding I'd avoid the debt.",

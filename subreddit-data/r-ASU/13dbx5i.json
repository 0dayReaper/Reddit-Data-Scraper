Or would it be better at this age to just study and get certs to find a job? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s still worth it to get the degree but someone recently told me I\u2019m too old and should be focused on getting into the industry to work sooner rather than later. Any advice would be appreciated!",

Especially when you have the opportunity to go through with zero debt.\n\nI think the bigger issue is to focus on the field of study that will fit you and your goals.  Be realistic about the job market as a whole for the field.\n\nIf you decide that the chosen field isn't great you can always try and pivot into something related to the degree or apply to anything that is looking for a minimum of 4 year degree.  If you get certs, they are good toward the fields they are used in, you used $ to get them that you can't get back, and you will start from square one if you change your mind later.  \n\nJust an opinion of an soon to be ancient graduate",

I am 36 and just returning to school, I haven't been to school in almost 2 decades, I have plenty of experience and seniority/security at my current job, as well as a comfortable position. But I will feel that much more accomplished and satisfied once I finish my degree and have an even greater chance to retain my position or acquire a role with more responsibilities. I've enjoyed the classes as well, I found Sociology a riveting subject that even helped shift perspectives and I was glad to get microeconomics out of the way. Subjects not likely to see in my line of work, but nonetheless, glad I have completed them as part of the degree plan! Best of luck!",

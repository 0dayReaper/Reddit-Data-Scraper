I don\u2019t have an internship lined up or anything, so I\u2019m looking for some worthwhile experience, as well as something to put on my resume. \n\nI\u2019m a marketing major, and I\u2019ve been looking at the digital marketing program. Has anyone here taken it? \n\nAlso, does anyone know if the general elective credits would apply for any upper division electives? Or with the business electives, can it be any business elective or does it only apply for the specific number listed on the program.",

So you might want to check with your academic advisor. However, the deadline for this summer has passed (or about to pass). In order for the advisor to make that 3 credits qualify for upper division electives, they need at least a few weeks",

I worked on a lot of case study projects from companies like Starbucks and Duolingo and then over the course of the program you learn how to build a store on Shopify, then learn how to promote it through Facebook ads and Google ads. I liked that i was able to learn how to make money online because i want to live that \u201cdigital nomad\u201d lifestyle and this seemed like a great way to work for yourself abroad. The teachers and team leaders were also really fun and gave me a ton of tips on how to have a successful marketing career. There were also opportunities for internships and a lot of networking when they\u2019d invite guest speakers to class.\n\n  \nAs far as electives go I\u2019d probably talk to your advisor. Doubt anyone on Reddit might be able to help you, haha",

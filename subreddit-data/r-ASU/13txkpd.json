I just don\u2019t know which to go with and honestly might end up double majoring but thought I would get some opinions on this. Would it just be better to double major or just sticking with one? I\u2019m also planning on minoring in real state!",

So if you know you want a business degree, get your major changed to one now so you can get a plan for working on those courses. I would recommend starting with BDA since there CIS 235 that is required and you\u2019ll likely be able to take that class right away, getting in contact with the IS dept faculty to learn more about the program.",

You don\u2019t have to be super passionate to get a degree, just have to be able to pass all the classes.\n\nIf you really hate programming and technology then you should swap, but if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s getting too hard, other majors also have their own difficulties.",

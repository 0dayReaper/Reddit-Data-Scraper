            "comment": "When I went to ASU about 5 years ago, I worked at the ISSC. Majority of students working their were international students. From what I remember, international students could only work part time (~20hrs/week), but check with the ISSC about a SSN or work regulations based on your F-1 visa. You can always look online on the [Student On Campus Portal](https://shibboleth2.asu.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.brassring.com%2Fsso%2Fsaml%2FSAML2PageListener%2FAuthenticationRequestor.aspx%3FLocation%3D5495) for current openings. It also was always easy to get a job through Aramark (food service on campus).",

            "comment": "There are a lot of jobs around the campus, I'd recommend going on Indeed (or ZipRecruiter or LinkedIn) and looking at jobs in the Tempe, Arizona area. Make sure to set the distance to 10 miles or less unless you have a car already or can take the bus. I'd probably wait to start applying until a week before I fly into Arizona since they might want an in-person interview and even if they don't, they probably don't want to wait a month for you to start.\n\nIn terms of highest paying, you probably won't find a ton over $15 an hour unless you have prior experience. I'd recommend taking a job as a dishwasher, server, store clerk, line cook, tutor, janitor or any that you see that might be relevant to your degree or that's interesting. Like there's a few jobs for part-time teacher's assistants or daycare workers which might work for some people. If your degree is/can be online and you think that'd be a good learning option for you, then look into the Starbucks College Achievement Plan - I used to work for Starbucks and the job isn't too bad, management is the biggest issue. The pay should still start around $15 an hour, part time and good benefits. I found that working 25-30 hours wasn't too hard with 2 accelerated classes at a time, it is definitely difficult though.\n\nI'm not sure if there are any restrictions for international students, I could try asking my friends, but they are all grad students and/or have been in the US for a long time.\n\nedit: Don't know how I forgot this, but also look into a ton of scholarships. There a couple geared towards international students, a bunch of general ones, a couple degree specific ones and a couple background specific ones (like non-traditional students). It takes time looking through the options (let alone finding them) and applying, but it's worth it if you can keep their requirements.\n\nu/garvkalra u/Prestigious_Memory64 Just in case this helps either of you two.",

Besides that, in my first semester I met this super nice dude at the little food shop inside Hayden library. He offered to help me get a job there after I talked to him for a little bit. \n\nFor most of these you should be good to apply before you arrive in Arizona, and I think there is a limit on how many hours you can work, but it should be sufficient to help pay down tuition. Additionally, if you have some work background, I'd take a look at ASU's staff job page \\[[2](https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGnewUI/Search/Home/Home?partnerid=25620&amp;siteid=5494#home)\\], there are definitely a couple a student could get.",

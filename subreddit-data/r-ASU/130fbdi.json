But, for some reason, there's a lot of negativity about ASU in my mind resulting in me into lean toward attending PSU. I\u2019ve received scholarships at ASU reducing my EFC by 40k. \n\nAlso, I am majoring in CS and would minor in business/philosophy/psychology. Can y'all please tell me about your experiences and why should I pick ASU. \n\nAnd, please tell me about internships, job opportunities, on-campus jobs, undergraduate teaching, etc.",

ASU accepted every DE and AP credit I have. Orientation went great. Got every class/ professor I wanted and both my program advisor and honors advisor were very helpful. I liked PSU but no merit for OOS tuition was the dealbreaker.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, ASU has some great opportunities especially for STEM since they\u2019ve put so much money towards that over the past decade(s) to try and get rid of the \u201cparty school\u201d nameplate; but, it also can feel more like a business than a university imo.",

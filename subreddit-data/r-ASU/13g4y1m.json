    "postText": "I got a horrible gpa my freshman year of college. However I had an undiagnosed learning disability. Since than my gpa as a general studies major was just under a 4.0. I plan on trying to get the highest grades possible in nursing prerequisites. If I can get a high pre requisite gpa on the 13/17 pre req selective gpa than will they consider my overall gpa and previous bad grades? As long as I meet the cumulative gpa requirement will I be ok?",

            "comment": "I know nursing school can be very competitive but as long as you meet the cum GPA requirements you should be okay. If they do look at your past grades then they'll see someone who struggled at first but later were able to succeed and that just makes you look better. Not everyone is gonna be a superstar 4.0+ every semester.\n\nAlso, FYI the Maricopa Community Colleges will offer an RN to Bachelor's of Science in Nursing starting Fall 2024 at Gateway CC. Much cheaper tuition than ASU. \nhttps://www.maricopa.edu/degrees-certificates/bachelors-degrees",

I started pre requisite and they are really hard! I got a c in microbiology so now I think I need to get an A in all the other science pre requisite to meet the select gpa requirement",

I transferred into my engineering program with no issue but I know nursing is a lot different. I went to Phoenix College and their RN program had a 1.5 to 2+ year waitlist from what I heard from students I tutored in chemistry. You can always take classes at cc then transfer those credits while also enrolled at ASU, that way you're not really a transfer student.",

I also kinda want the college experience again and ik nursing school isn\u2019t the typical college experience and is more work. But I got unlucky with family things throughout my college experience. I kinda wanna be at a university again for myself",

The shuttles are there so you don\u2019t have to drive around. \n\nI personally think the prerequisite are easy A\u2019s but the science ones. But the ASU nursing counselor are amazing and help you out with figuring your plan to apply for nursing school. \n\nAlso take advantage of taking summer classes at community college over the summer. They help with the work load and help you get ahead. \n\nBeing competitive is scary but some years, they have enough room for all the competitive applicants",

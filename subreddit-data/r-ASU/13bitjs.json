If you prefer slides, you can find them at https://adamdoupe.com/teaching/classes/cse340-principles-of-programming-languages-f16/. Profs are still basing their slides on Doup\u00e9's, so don't worry about it being outdated. If you have any specific questions, I just finished CSE 340, so feel free to dm.",

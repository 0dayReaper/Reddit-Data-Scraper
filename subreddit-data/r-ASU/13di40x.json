I was wondering if there are any clubs for these, or where to go about looking for a game when i get there? Thanks in advance.",

They're mostly focused on Magic the Gathering, but there are a few dnd 5e DMs in their discord, and as far as I know I'm the only pf2e DM there. They run tabletop events from time to time, but if you're looking for a campaign and not just the occasional one shot you'd be best off looking for a group in the club discord. I am currently planning on starting up a second campaign next semester, I'll post more about it in their discord then, but if you'd be interested let me know there.",

I tried to call financial aid but there was 230+ callers ahead of me. I think something in the system got messed up again, which, I just need to know if I am getting aid or not since tomorrow is last day to drop classes- in the case I cannot actually pay for them.",

The second person said I had a hold on my account and it needed to be reviewed. The 3rd lady got my account reviewed and approved today. The two calls got disconnected so please ask them to call you back if the call disconnects\u2026 if not you will be calling back and forth  like me \ud83d\ude05",

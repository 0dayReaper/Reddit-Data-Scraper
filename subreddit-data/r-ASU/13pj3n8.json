The networking courses with Damien were my favorite.\n\nJust a warning that the quality in staff has declined in recent years, with the best leaving/being fired and the worst being promoted.",

It helped get a gauge on what I wanna further pursue. Although I will say that some of the classes don\u2019t really provide anything to necessarily \u201clearn\u201d and end up just  following instructions and checking off boxes",

I'm finding 101 to be an immense amount of busy work but that's probably because it's accelerated. 103 is super slow rn and he releases stuff weekly so no going ahead or even trying to study what it might be. 166 is honestly really fun and interesting and the teacher seems amazing.",

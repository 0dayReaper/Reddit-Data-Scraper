    "postText": "WHY do they have to be due a week or more BEFORE the class is over? If the professors can\u2019t see the responses until a few weeks after anyways, why have it be before the class is over? I understand they might be trying to mitigate people bad-mouthing if they do poorly on the final or whatever\u2026 but having it due in the busiest time of the semester is extremely annoying. Just missed submitting two of them as a result\u2026 really wish I would have had the time to put them in.",

It would make sense to have it open for a week after, or at least for a few days after the end of the semester. Tbh I\u2019ve never got a reply back after completing one and some teachers probably get a lot of bad evals, I\u2019m not sure how much they really take them seriously lol.",

The reason faculty don\u2019t get the results until after grades post is so that they are not influenced by any true or perceived feedback from a particular student when entering final grades. It\u2019s pretty easy to tell who submitted certain responses (or at least think you might be able to guess), so the results stay under lock and key until after grades post. \n\nThe instructors do get their course eval results and whether the results impact any sort of change varies from person to person. How much stock a department puts in the course evals also varies, but I can tell you that when there is an obvious concern about a class or instructor, the first two things departments look at are final grade stats (specifically DEW rates) and course evals.",

There\u2019s always going to be some percentage of students who don\u2019t pass. But when you look at the rate for a class, you\u2019ll want to consider if the rate is exceptionally low or high given the content. And is the rate significantly higher or lower as compared to the class as taught by other instructors. If the answer is yes, then something may be off about how the course is structured or the quality of the instruction being provided.",

Even if you're taking a full stack there's no way that 50% of people truly don't have just 30 minutes in a two week window to complete them.  I don't think the school should push completing surveys at all but they do and they do it before the semester is over to get a more accurate opinion of the course from you.  There are two many instances of people bombing finals and either failing the course or getting a bad grade and then going \"this course is shit blah blah blah\".  So instead they want your opinion on the material instead of a very possible last minute flunk.",

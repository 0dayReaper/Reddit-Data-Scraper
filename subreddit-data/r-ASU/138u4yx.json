And whether or not it's a good idea to do it the last semester? \n\nHow is the hiring process for new-grads during senior year?\n\nTIA",

            "comment": "I feel like it\u2019s going to be either really easy or really rough just entirely depending on your last semester schedule I have no idea how Capstone would work if one semester you were in the US working with your team and another you\u2019re abroad.\n\nI will speak mainly on the hiring process. Start *now* basically, setup LinkedIn and update it, start getting connections, create a good resume now and add to it basically after everything you do, and (almost most importantly) if you have time make up a public GitHub account and try to make a few projects on the side to display your skills (especially try to make projects focused on the area of CS you want to go into more -EX- want to be a full stack developer? Make an angular/Spring project for a single page application that connects to a Database)\n\nA lot of employers are scared to take a risk on a new employee that has nothing to show besides class projects and a GPA, the tech industry right now is kinda all over the place (I work at a fairly large media company so I hear a lot of it and handle a good bit of the interviews nowadays), and don\u2019t be afraid to get a low paying job, go to a contractor company, or even tech internship for your first job. Definitely aim for the stars and try to get the best that you can, but if you need to don\u2019t be ashamed to take a job to get experience to then go to a different job.\n\n\nIf you have any questions definitely feel free to ask",

Also, it can take months for your foreign transcript to arrive and get processed back into ASU credits, so while you can walk at graduation your diploma delivery would most likely get delayed",

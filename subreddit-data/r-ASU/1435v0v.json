    "postText": "So, hypothetically speaking of course\u2026 if I were to transfer to ASU from out of state, how is my living expenses looking off campus? Obviously tuition alone is a kick in the nuts but kick me while I\u2019m down and tell me how off campus living is. I would assume I need a roommate if I don\u2019t want to pay both an arm and a leg, but rather just one of those extremities. Thank youu!",

I haven\u2019t checked this year but my guess is that\u2019s about as good as it gets unless you\u2019re comfortable commuting from a lot further.",

Old houses (never older than the 60s). \n\nYou mention out of state tuition. That sucks. I think you need to be really objective about what benefits you get from that extra investment. This is a very competitive world. Money and career are fun but they need to be respected. I treat those decisions like war. \n\nYou need to do whatever will give you an edge. Spending an extra 10k a semester is not something I'll ever support. ASU isn't worth that, no college is unless you're highly highly competitive (in which case you'd go somewhere better than ASU). There's an ASU level college in every state in the country. You should stay where you are.\n\nFor the vast majority of people roi should be the number 1 concern for college",

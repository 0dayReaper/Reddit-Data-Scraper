    "postText": "Congratulations to all the Future Sun Devils who committed to ASU, I am so happy for you! As I saw more posts regarding the class sessions, grading, etc., I decided to clear the doubts for all incoming first-year and transfer students.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. What are A-session, B-Session, and C-session classes?**\n\nDuring the regular academic year (fall and spring), each semester is 16 weeks long including the final exams week. Session A is the first half of the semester (7.5 weeks), Session B is the second half of the semester (7.5 weeks), and Session C is the full semester. The summer term operates differently. The Summer A-session is the first 6 weeks, Summer B-session is the next 6 weeks, and Summer C-session is the first 8 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. When are my finals?**\n\nSome lower-division classes and a few accounting classes will have a common final exam, and the time is listed on the [ASU Final Exam Schedule](https://students.asu.edu/final-exam-schedule). Most classes offered as C-session will have a final exam scheduled during the final exam, whether it's in-person or online. A-session and B-session classes usually have the final exam on the last day of class. If you are unsure about the final exam of certain courses, please either refer to the Final Exam Schedule or email the instructor if it's available. However, some classes may not have final exams, such as most classes offered by MLFTC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. How many credits can I take per semester?**\n\nDuring the regular fall and spring semesters, you can take up to 18 credit hours without filing the overload petition. The exception is for students majoring in Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, which they can take up to 19 credit hours per semester. Overload doesn't cost more money but it costs you sanity. I normally do not recommend overload if you're a first-semester freshman unless you feel confident about it. For more detailed information, please ask your advisor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. When I can sign up for my classes?**\n\nIf you're an incoming freshman, you cannot register for anything before your orientation/advising. Incoming transfer students can register for their classes after meeting with their advisors. Normally, transfer credits are posted to students' academic records within 2-5 weeks once ASU receives your transcript.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5. Can I get an \"A+\" in my classes?**\n\nIt depends on the class and professor. Although ASU uses the [plus-minus system](https://students.asu.edu/grades), instructors have the option to use the full scale (10 letter grades), flat scale (5 letter grades), or other customized scales. Some classes, such as HCR 210 or HCR 220 offered by Edson College of Nursing and Health Innovation, usually do not use pluses and minuses. On the other hand, most classes offered by Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, such as TEL 212, and TEL 310, use the plus-only scale (they redesigned the curriculum last summer).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6. Are the textbooks/course materials required?**\n\nIn most cases, yes, if it's integrated with the Pearson/Webassign/WeBWork or whatever adaptive learning system the course will use. Some professors don't use the textbook, and they upload all the necessary readings on Canvas. If the course doesn't specify particular versions of the textbook, you can get the previous versions at low to no costs. Still unsure? Ask your professor or consult the past syllabi.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7. I want to self-study beforehand, and where can I find the syllabus?**\n\nThere are two ways to find the syllabus of a particular course. The first way is to Google ASU (Course Code) syllabus. Another way is from the [ASU Course Search](https://catalog.apps.asu.edu/catalog/classes). You can find the syllabus from the previous semesters. Some lower-division STEM classes, such as PHY 111 and MAT 117, may have a common syllabus, in which the policies are standardized regardless of the instructor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8. Is \"D\" a passing grade for my classes?**\n\nYou can find the Major Map (Required Courses) from the [ASU Degrees Search Website](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/bachelors/major-list/letter/all). The Major Map tells you what you need for each course. If the course requires a minimum grade of C, then a D does not fulfill the requirement. The D grade is passing for General Education (GE) courses and electives. However, if you want to double-dip a major requirement and a GE requirement, then you need at least a C to satisfy the requirement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**9. How many online classes can I take per semester?**\n\nFor fall and spring semesters, in-state and out-of-state students typically do not have restrictions on how many online classes they can take, but international students must enroll in at least 9 credits of in-person classes (undergraduate) and 6 credits of in-person classes (graduate). Hybrid classes are considered as in-person classes, and iCourses are online classes. Note: if you're an ASU Online student, you cannot take iCourses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10. Should I rely on RateMyProfessor to register for my classes?**\n\nYes, but please be cautious that not all the ratings reflect the instructor accurately. Students will make the ratings as harsh as possible when they are failing classes. In fact, some bad professors may have a more lenient grading system, while some high-rated professors may have higher expectations (harder to get an A/A+). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**11. Can I take classes at different campuses or across different colleges/schools?**\n\nIt depends. Some major and minor programs restrict students must take classes at the designated campus/colleges/schools. For example, the [Mathematics minor](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/minors/major/ASU00/LAMATMIN/mathematics) offered by The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) does not allow any upper-division MAT courses outside of the CLAS. Otherwise, you can take classes at any of Tempe, West, Downtown, and Polytechnic campuses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**12. I want to change my major or add a minor, what should I do?**\n\nChanging majors is totally normal. You can look up the major course map for your desired major and start taking the prerequisites. Some programs offered by the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering and W. P. Carey School of Business have different admission standards for current students. The best way to get this question answered is to ask your advisors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**13. Why the grade on Canvas does not match the grading scale outlined on the syllabus?**\n\nUsually, Canvas computes your grade based on the default scale set forth by ASU, and some of your professors may not know or be able to edit the built-in grading scheme to be consistent with the syllabus. You can only trust the Canvas Grade Book *if and only* if your professor inputs the scale indicated on the syllabus. Otherwise, please use an Excel spreadsheet to perform the grade calculation (search for relevant tutorial videos on YouTube if you're new to Excel).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**14. My grade on a specific assignment is low and I want to appeal, what should I do?**\n\nProfessors making grading errors can drive students crazy, and I experienced this before. Before pressing chains of emails to your professor, I recommend re-view to read the rubric to see if you *really* followed the rubric when writing your assignment. Also, please utilize the ASU Writing Center and practice the use of APA/MLA citations and formatting for essays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**15. Why there are so many different math/calculus courses offered?**\n\nDifferent major programs require different levels of math intensity. Each course is geared towards specific majors/groups.\n\n* MAT 117, MAT 119, MAT 142, and MAT 170 are for those students whose major programs don't require anything beyond Algebra II/Trigonometry/Precalculus.\n* MAT 210 and MAT 211 are for Business majors.\n* MAT 251 is for Biology/Env Sci or any Life Science (non-Engineering) majors.\n* MAT 26X Sequence is for Engineering majors. MAT 243 is for CS/CSE/EE majors.\n* MAT 27X Sequence is for Mathematics/Physical Sciences/Secondary Education majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**16. Will XXX courses fulfill my degree requirement?**\n\nIt depends on your major program. For any teacher-preparation major at MLFTC, your advisor will replace TEL 215 with the equivalent of CDE 232 or PSY 101. If you change to a major that requires lower math but you took all the way to MAT 272, MAT 270 will satisfy your MA requirement (at least in MLFTC). The best way is to consult your major advisor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**17. Can I take my classes out of sequence?**\n\nTechnically, you can. However, not every course is offered every semester. So, if you miss it then it delays your graduation by 1-3 semesters. You can take your GE courses out of sequence but for upper-division courses, this is a risky move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**18. Can I register for a course while taking the prerequisite?**\n\nYes. If the course you registered for is in the fall, you must complete and pass the prerequisite courses in the spring and summer semesters. For example, MTE 485 is offered in the Fall 2023 semester with prerequisites of MAT 310 (offered in Spring 2023) and MAT 300 (offered in both Spring and Summer 2023). By the end of the Spring 2023 semester, the system will check your grade for MAT 310 and/or MAT 300. The system will purge you from MTE 485 if a D is earned in either MAT 310 or MAT 300.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope my clarifications help! Have a great summer (for high school graduates)! Good luck with your finals(for current ASU students)!\n\nEDIT: I added additional items based on my personal experience.",

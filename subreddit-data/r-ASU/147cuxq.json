    "postText": "I asked a professor in engineering for a PhD role but the professor responded back saying that the research topic is good but the professor does not have PhD funding. I took a masters course under the same professor an year ago and was really fascinated with the content of the course. \nCan someone please let me know if there is any other way to obtain funding for the PhD ?",

            "comment": "To fund a particular student for PhD the research lab must have funding specifically for the student, this is a Graduate Research Assistant (RA) position. If you're accepted into the PhD program you will be possibly funded through the specific fulton school, typically as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (TA) position until you can find a professor to accept you to an RA position. Funding amounts can vary by program as well as the terms in how you receive your stipend through the TA/RA positions.\n\nFor my program, those who did not already have an RA position when starting their PhD program were funded through the TA position for the first semester and during the first 8 weeks they had to interview and submit their preferred research professors and the professors held a draft, of sorts, and picked who they'd like in their labs. Some students were offered an RA position during the interview process. \n\nBut each program varies greatly on how they operate for RA/TA appointments. Like in some programs being a TA is mandatory or others do a rotational where you switch labs at set intervals before you can choose who you finally stay with. Hard to say what your program could require without knowing which engineering it is but look for the program's graduate handbook on the ASU website and it will give more concrete info.",

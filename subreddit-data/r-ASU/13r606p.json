    "postText": "I am currently a Business Major (scm) but not really interested in it. I am not really interested in anything in the business field and just chose business because I was confused about what I wanted to do. I am a rising junior for the Fall semester of 2023. I am thinking of completely doing a 360 and trying to get into computer science/ mechanical engineering. These majors seem a lot more interesting to me and would seem like something I would be passionate about. I just wanted to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how did you navigate the major switch.  I also understand that I might need an extra year in order to complete CS/ME . I have a 4.0 GPA currently at W.P. Carey which I know is meaningless and will definitely drop being an engineering major. Any advice will be appreciated.",

Computer Info Systems and Business Data Analytics are both computer based degrees and may be worth exploring before completely changing colleges for something you may not like either. \n\nThe best place to start is by considering what you may want to do after university and then determining what credentials you will need to do that. I'd recommend making an appointment with the WPC Career Center (and/or ASU Career Center) and your Advisor for additional advice.",

Some advice I have is to join clubs and try to find CS majors in that club. It doesn\u2019t have to be SODA, you will find CS majors everywhere",

            "comment": "Only because a major like engineering seems interesting means nothing, a meaningful step to take is to manage your time to take some of the core classes in the stem field to see if you can handle the intensity, because hard stem major is not for everyone. I had a friend brag about how passionate she is about engineering, but dropped the major immediately after the first intro class",

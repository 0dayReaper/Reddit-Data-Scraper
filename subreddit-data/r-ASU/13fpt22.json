    "postText": "In the spring semester I was taking a human rights online class. The grade on Canvas was finalized as a B-, 81.61%. However, the final course grade on MyASU comes out as a C+. I have checked the syllabus and a C+ is considered &lt;80-77% while a B- is considered &lt;84-80% according to this specific class. Which means I should initially be seeing a B- in the final course grade. I have emailed the instructor of the class and have kindly asked for clarification on this, but it\u2019s only been about 24 hours. The syllabus has stated to expect a response within 72 hours. However, I don\u2019t want to time to take over and not be able to put in a grade appeal. So would I have a case for a grade appeal here? Should I wait out the 72 hours and then go with the grade appeal path? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Well the course is over, so the 72 hours for a response can jump to infinity and there's nothing you can do about it for starters. \n\nAs for the grade, most professors (even those teaching online) either don't understand how to use the Canvas gradebook or don't want to put the effort into it, so the grade you see on Canvas will likely be just a raw percentage of points earned with respect to points available; it doesn't take into account weightings by category (homework, quizzes, exams, etc.) that are also listed in the syllabus. I'm willing to bet that once you do the proper calculation, you're going to see you actually earned a C+.",

            "comment": "I'll echo what others have said in here, the Canvas gradebook should be used as a guide, but that's it. Calculate the grade yourself based on the information in the syllabus and see if you come up with the same answer. It's possible the grading scale in the class wasn't set right or the professor entered your grade incorrectly into Peoplesoft. \n\nAs far as I know, there's no time constraints on a grade appeal, and I've submitted grade change requests months after the class ended. If you don't hear back in a week, email them again. If another week goes by, then yeah [submit a grade appeal](https://asuacademicaffairs-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report). Just remember, it's summer, a lot of staff and faculty are out of the office, so things might move slower.",

Thankfully, ASU makes it easy for instructors to fix grading errors. However, the Canvas grade estimator is just an estimator. It may not match the grading rubric outlined on the syllabus. \n\n(And yes, it\u2019s totally confusing and annoying if the grading isn\u2019t set up on Canvas, but it happens.)\n\nCross check the math with the syllabus and see what it looks like. Then just email your instructor if you still have questions. If it\u2019s an error, don\u2019t panic. There is totally a process for fixing this.",

Three more working days, then bump again. If no answer, bump again and add the college dean. It will be solved.",

They should email the professor and ask for clarification, keeping in mind that it's summer and we kind of like having some time off. If they don't hear back in a week, email them again. From there if there's no contact there are some options. They can email the undergrad coordinator for that department or the chair/director. Again, keeping in mind that it's summer. \n\nAnother option would be to just [file for a grade appeal](https://asuacademicaffairs-advocate.symplicity.com/public_report) as it's more likely there are admin staff working than faculty.",

Don't worry about how friends and family feel, it's not their accomplishment, it's yours, you will have done it, but be prepared to hear them all have opinions on whether you should go or not.",

Anytime u asked them they replied with was there for the knowledge nothing else. \n\nHonestly it's a waste of time an money in my opinion, your better off celebrating on ur own if u must",

I booked a trip to Mexico during that week and \u201ccelebrated\u201d getting through undergrad my own way - traveling. Since I was not able to do much of it during school.

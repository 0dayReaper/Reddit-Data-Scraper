Are you a hand note taker or do you plan on typing your notes/using an iPad. If the second is the case, a small bag should be sufficient to hold a device and lab coat and goggles for labs. If you like to hand take your notes in a notebook I recommend having a notebook for each class and having a backpack for them. I personally am a hand note taker so I wear a backpack with all of my notebooks in it because I often do other school work between classes that require my other notebooks.",

            "comment": "A backpack is better for your shoulders/back if properly adjusted, but it depends on how often and how heavy of stuff you'll be carrying. I personally like backpacks because they have utility outside of school, but that's more of a personal preference.",

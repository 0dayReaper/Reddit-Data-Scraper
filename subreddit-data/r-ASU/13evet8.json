I want to make sure that I pass this class without getting overwhelmed because of how short it is. Any helpful advice or suggestions?",

The textbook was actually interesting (hopefully it's the same one by Kenneth Feder) and I enjoyed reading it which made the weekly short essay responses and quizzes that much easier. Is it just this one class you're taking?",

If this kind of stuff interests you then I think you'll really enjoy the class which makes things so much easier lol. I really enjoyed learning about the human evolution parts from the course, some of the ancient structures and how they were created (Stonehenge and the pyramids), and the Indus River Valley civilizations like Mohenjo Daro. The author of the textbook also has a great section about pseudoscience and he does a great job of debunking a lot of the typical bs like ancient aliens type arguments and whatnot. I took the course 2 years ago so the fact that I retained a lot of the material says a lot lol.\n\nAnyway enjoy the class, it's definitely enjoyable! Don't get behind and you'll do great!",

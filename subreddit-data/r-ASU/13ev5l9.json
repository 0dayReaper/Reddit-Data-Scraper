Any help would be great!\n\nIs it too late to apply now?\n\nHow common is it to receive scholarships?\n\nI can't afford to go without one, so could someone post a link as to where I can apply/look up scholarships?\n\nI'm an average student, I got mostly As and Bs. Does that make me eligible for a scholarship?\n\nCan anyone let me know how I can contact a scholarship advisor?\n\n(I will be a fall 23 freshman btw)",

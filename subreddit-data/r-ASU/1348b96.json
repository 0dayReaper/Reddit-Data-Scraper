The resulting cost is about $50k/yr while ASU, my in-state option is around $20k/yr after $16k scholarship and Barrett. Do you guys think UMD is worth it in this case or should I stick to ASU?

It doesn\u2019t matter as much where you get your degree from, but it matters how much effort you put into the degree and what you do with it afterwards. I know plenty of people that graduated with a CS degree from ASU and they were able to get jobs from top tiered companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. (assuming that\u2019s even a goal of yours). Being able to save a substantial amount of money like that will give you financial freedom for the future sooner. I\u2019m sure UMD has a great program, but for the huge cost difference, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it to me. But good luck, and so excited that you chose CS, it\u2019s a great field \ud83d\ude03",

I did CS as an undergrad and despite knowing many of them, I still kick myself knowing I could\u2019ve done so much more. In my opinion, being a high achieving student at ASU nets you way more opportunities in your undergrad than being a high achieving student in a highly ranked school. ASU has a ton of money and connections, they are just looking for the right students to put in those places to represent the school.",

The biggest difference is the people you\u2019ll meet. You\u2019ll still be able find a job post graduation from either school. I personally see an undergrad as a means to an end (finding a mechanical engineering position). I didn\u2019t see it worth going into 120k into debt for a piece of paper. \n\nHere\u2019s an analogy: it\u2019s kinda like buying a car. You could buy the expensive McLaren or Corvette. Certain set of people will be attracted to it. But if you\u2019re just buying it to go from point A to point B maybe you\u2019re better off with the Honda Civic. \n\nIf your dedicated to UMD and it\u2019s what you want then spend the extra money. But if you\u2019re hesitant and just there for the degree it\u2019s probably smarter to save there money for the things you\u2019re truly passionate about/enjoy. \n\nAlso, IMO Barrett is a scam\n\nNote: I own neither a Honda Civic, McLaren or Corvette",

Others have already commented on the financial aspects -- I obviously understand that 20k extra per year is quite a significant amount and you definitely need to factor that in while making a decision. ASU wins in that regard (cost of living is also a lot lower, College Park being near DC makes matters worse).\n\nSome context: I did my PhD in CS at ASU, MS at a \"top 10\" university, and I am now a faculty member at another university. I know a few CS professors at UMD.\n\nBoth ASU and UMD are large public research universities, although UMD is much better ranked in terms of their research and undergrad program. UMD is one of the best places in the US to study computer science (especially AI). If a graduate degree is something you're considering in the future -- definitely go to UMD -- there are significantly more research opportunities at UMD than at ASU. UMD is also closer to national labs, government agencies, and a lot more industry than PHX -- this may be important for internship and job prospects.\n\nIf you decide to go to ASU, you will have a great time too! The CS department is growing, and has a lot of awesome professors, especially in newer areas of CS like AI and robotics. Wherever you go: don't stay isolated, talk to your professors and TA's, ask for help, enjoy your classes, and learn a lot! If you do that, you can be equally successful and satisfied at either university.",

Not only has my tuition been almost completely covered, but I will graduate in only two years going to ASU. OOS schools also take credits as different classes and fill different degree requirements. I was a junior when I started. I would\u2019ve been a Sophomore anywhere else. Bold to assume I didn\u2019t look into things. ASU wasn\u2019t the only college I looked at",

Two states? Wow! You made it to *checks map* Texas?). You can stay in state and be an \"adult\". It's all about how your parents interact with you while you are here. Your folks seem to have missed that; it's not about you, it's about *them*. \n\n&gt;College is the time to move on from home and move out of state. Odds are you never will if you don\u2019t now.\n\nComplete bs. \n\nMany organizations (e.g. the Flinn Foundation) realize the importance of keeping good students in-state. If you graduate from the state schools, you are less likely to move out of state (look up \"brain-drain\").",

Something you can\u2019t do with your family near you because we all have a tendency to still feel like a child around our parents and subject ourselves to that. College is also for growth and experience. It\u2019s a time you don\u2019t get back. \n\u201cMany students come to college looking for a clean slate \u2014 an opportunity to start over socially and even reinvent themselves. Attending college out of state can help students find new communities, friend groups, and relationships.\u201d\n\nMathisen said one of the toughest things for new college students can also be the healthiest: space from your family.\n\nMathisen helps many prospective students view the experience of studying away from family as a formative one \u2014 a challenge to overcome. He remembers his lack of a \u201csafety cushion,\u201d regarding things like being able to drive home to do laundry or stay for the weekend, as an edifying experience. He believes being able to rely more on himself and his peers helped him begin a new chapter of self-discovery.",

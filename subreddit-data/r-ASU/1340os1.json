For me, of course I'm not happy it's an obvious bribe from the Biden administration for the next election at the cost of taxpayer money. But hey, where I'm at right now, I'm not gonna turn down free money :/",

You're either a sucker or a beneficiary here, you'll get sucked dry taking out student loans to stuff your head with worthless information that won't get you a job. Or if you're smart, you'll find resources and connections that will propel you to your dream career. So I don't hate the system, even when I see out-of-state students pay dozens of grands to learn 3rd grade math, or find art majors outside the library promoting socialism/communism because they are locked into minimum wage jobs after graduating. I immigrated to the states in my teens, grew up in poverty-level income household, and the university saved me by giving me full aid and opportunities to do research with competent professionals.\n&gt;\n&gt;The high acceptance rate itself is not a problem, many universities in Europe also accept most to all students but adds value to the degree by making it hard to graduate. The difference here is that those European universities are free or extremely cheap, and ASU accepts most students to suck money out of them. So plan and act out your time here so you get more than what you paid for.",

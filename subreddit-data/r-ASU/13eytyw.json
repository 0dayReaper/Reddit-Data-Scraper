That was the only course where doing the problems in the back of the book was a necessity for me to do well on Menendez\u2019s tests. Those were a lot more helpful than his practice tests. And it was needed since not everything was covered in the lectures that appeared on the test. Also the tests were open book but only if you had a physical copy so I would recommend it just for that if your class is the same.",

The final is 30% worth and honestly, easiest final ever. \n\nIn the discord server for 121, people made memes about him.",

    "postText": "TLDR: A good friend of mine suggested I double major in both finance and business data analytics. I'm currently majoring in Finance, and will be studying German via International Business certificate (Which includes a semester study abroad).\n\nI don't have any coding experience whatsoever, but am up for the challenge (how much more difficult than spoken languages can it be, right?)\n\nI'm currently pretty far ahead of the game as far as credits are concerned-- I'll have 41 credits of my Finance major left by the time I finish my fall semester of Sophomore year (I can get away with only taking like 9 credits a semester from then on). I consider myself to be a pretty decent student, passing almost all of my classes with A's without spending too much time studying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions right now are basically:\n\n\\- How does a major in BDA compliment a major in Finance (and German)? Do you all think this combination makes any sense for a career?\n\n\\- Is it worth giving up my relatively light workload and adding more credits to my map? I was kind of enjoying the idea of cruising through my last few semesters with light workloads (which I'd like to have because I'll be abroad for a semester, which makes things kindof difficult)\n\nAny words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "Language and Data use completely different parts of the brain. Being good with foreign languages doesn't mean you'll be good with programming. BDA are all CIS classes. I hear this all the time... Finance majors being told to take BDA by friends, and most come back hating it. \n\nI believe the thought process is that many Finance jobs these days benefit from a more thorough understanding of the related programs, increased analytical skills, or even being able to create your own analysis programs that not every one else sees too for a step up. BDA teaches you about using many programs and creating within them to analyze data. \n\nYou can choose just to take a few classes in relevant programs too, not a full major. There's also the Applied BDA certificate, which honestly is the one I would say to look at if you want it as a complement. They are completely different CIS classes meant to focus more on hands-on use. \n\nThe entire Applied BDA is also on Universal Learner. So, you could take the first CIS class on Universal Learner this Summer got $425 and see what you think and if it clicks with you. You might take a look at the Risk Management certificate too.",

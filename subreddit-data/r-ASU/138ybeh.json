Some even got to the extent of removing the practice question modules from Canvas.\n\nI mean just why such a crappy and ancient approach for a university that is No. 1 in innovation \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

It's not like we have a question tree we can pluck new questions from and there's not really an automatic way of generating questions that most faculty would know how to use. My exams don't show the correct answer, ever. Any student can email me and we can discuss the questions and the answer, but that's on the student. I'm not going to make it easy for all of the answers to my exams to pop up online.",

There's only so many things one can ask in a class that uses the same book for more than a semester. Call it laziness or just efficiency, but why should I change all of my questions every semester, when 99.9% of my students have never seen these questions before? It makes very little sense.",

If you know you want to switch, you can submit the request online. \n\nIn pursuing that major you will need to work closely with both an academic advisor for the major and a pre-health advisor for discussing your path to a health profession. While there is not a higher GPA requirement to graduate with the Med Studies degree, you should be aiming for 3.5+ in order to be competitive for graduate programs. \n\nIf you want to discuss the Major and get an idea of a graduation timeline before you request the major change, you can [make an appointment with a Health Solutions advisor](https://students.chs.asu.edu/advising/contact-advisor).",

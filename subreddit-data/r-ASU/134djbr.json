It's shocking that she isn't willing to adjust the grades even though the exams were unreasonably specific and plenty of students didn't do well. Thanks for any input",

If I remember correctly, I think we were allowed to be regraded by the TAs for part of our project once though. I am not sure if she does or does not curve. My groupmates and I had around mid 90s at the end of the sem, but it updated to be a few percentages higher surprisingly before final grades were posted. I'm not sure if that was her curving it at all but yeah.",

She seemed flexible on some extensions and also allowed regrading for us but was pretty stuck on the grades we got so I was surprised.\n\n&gt;but it updated to be a few percentages higher surprisingly before final grades were posted\n\nThat's a little hopeful for a curve! lol",

    "postText": "Incoming freshman here. I wanted to know if there are any lgbtqia+ clubs on campus? I'm living in Tucson and it'd be nice to know there's a community present on campus I can find support in when I move up in a few months. I haven't been able to find any information about this. It seems like there isn't anything like this on campus, so I thought I would ask.\n\nSide note: If you're interested you can hmu on here. I'm always down to make new friends.",

Also check out the [Rainbow Coalition](https://eoss.asu.edu/cultural-connections/get-involved/rainbow-coalition). They're the umbrella organization for most of them and they organize stuff at the beginning of the school year.",

For example, TransFam for transgender students, and ASpec Alliance for agender/asexual/aromantic people. \n\nOut In STEM for queer science students \n\nLGBT-Birds+ for Thunderbird School of Global Management students \n\nLGBTQ Interaction for volunteering \n\nBarrett LGBTQ+ club for honors students \n\nGamma Rho Lambda is the queer sorority \n\nThen there\u2019s clubs for the non-Tempe campuses: Prism for Polytechnic, Spectrum for West, and Confetti for Downtown Phoenix\n\nI can try to answer any other questions you have about specific clubs!",

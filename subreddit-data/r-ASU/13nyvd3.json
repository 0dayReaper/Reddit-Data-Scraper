I called the ASU Helpdesk at 1 (855) 278-5080 and they put me through to DUO support where they were able to update my number in their system and the ASU category appeared on my DUO app 5 minutes after calling. \nIt was very helpful because I was able to talk to an actual person at DUO support and he stayed on the line with me until he was sure I could log onto MyASU.",

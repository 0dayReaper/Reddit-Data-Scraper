Please share this on all of your social media and encourage people to sign!**\n\nAs some of you have seen I have been reading and responding to students\u2019 feelings about the COVID-19 situation\u2019s impact on our situations as students and the University\u2019s responses to it. I drafted this letter/petition and reviewed it with other ASU student leaders to demand the items that we students are asking for and in need of.\n\nOur goal is for this petition to receive 48,000 signatures to help these issues jump from #48 on Michael Crow\u2019s list up to #1, because that\u2019s how important they are to us, and essential for us to succeed and stay healthy.",

The tuition that has been paid by students is either spent or allotted, on things like salaries and maintenance of buildings. \n\nGiving back everyone's tuition means giving back a huge chunk of the money ASU \"makes\" in a year. That's impossible - it'll never happen. \n\nLook, I get this sucks, but TONS of people are losing money in this crisis.

If they didn\u2019t they wouldn\u2019t be around. The institution has been open since the late 1800s and has steadily increased the amount the charge up to today\u2019s prices. I get what you\u2019re saying that they aren\u2019t swimming in money, but their pockets are definitely deep enough to refund the students LIVING ON CAMPUS. This refund system isn\u2019t targeting off-campus residents unless, they had some form of meal plan or parking. I\u2019m not suggesting we go to Michael crows house and break the safe, but offering a small amount to each individual who is eligible would certainly ease over a lot of anger. I\u2019m not sure if you follow the stimulus check news, but the majority of students are not eligible for the 1,200 in most cases because they\u2019re a dependent in someway. If that isn\u2019t your case, congratulations, but I know a lot of people who\u2019s families are struggling and they aren\u2019t receiving a gov check or a daddy crow check.",

Got a /mK sticker I can snap a picture of?\n\nI haven\u2019t dived into any ASU financial reports (nor do I want to), but don\u2019t operate under the assumption that they are paying cash for everything. Large scale upgrade projects like college expansion or semiconductor fabrication sites are funded by loans. They may very well be operating in a negative- which would be a reason for no refunds.",

Maybe parking should get a refund, but housing makes so sense as we have a choice in living there (it's not ASU's problem if your parents forced you out)",

Staying in the dorms is the most stupidest thing you could possibly do when you\u2019re surrounded by hundreds of students who are off from traveling across god know where for spring break all in one building when the sensible thing to do is keep your distance and get the hell out of there\n\nOther colleges across the country are making students go home and are accommodating them properly and ethically, the only reason asu says housing is open is because they\u2019re money grubbing greedy assholes who want to use that as an excuse so they don\u2019t technically have to give out refunds. And yet from what I see from other posts, housing is urging students to leave, especially those from California since it\u2019s a possibility the state will go under Marshall law.\n\nSorry Insider for Crow, but no one is going to be taking this lightly, especially with the narcissistic comments Crow foolishly made.",

They know damn well people weren\u2019t going to return to a school with 70k+ students who just got back from spring break traveling all over around the world right around when Covid-19 was about to be considered a global pandemic for Christ sake. \n\nPlus I\u2019ve only heard Harvard actually forcing freshman out of dorms and making them go home, I\u2019m pretty sure housing is still open at UofA, so that\u2019s all complete bullshit on why they can\u2019t give refunds to those who have their own and their loved ones health in their best interest.",

I just do not get it, with most of us leave, the don\u2019t have to buy as much food to serve, don\u2019t have to pay a lot for water or electric bills, and (in a bad way I might say) there are other things they would be profiting from this. It was our money initially to begin, saying this I\u2019m not completely in a financial crisis because of this (still my money though), but they have to think of other students who worked hard to get those things paid just to get the things they need in return. They are saying 100% service, but they know damn well that in order to access it we have to risk our healths. We paid for college, we didn\u2019t pay to gamble, there shouldn\u2019t be any risks accessing our services on campus, and if there are any risks, it is appropriate for refunds since we didn\u2019t sign up for those at the beginning. After saying all this, I\u2019m not even sure if we\u2019re gonna get any refunds from them at all, but I feel it for some people that had to work hard for this and their hard work would just end up feeding those greedy people. If they don\u2019t do refunds, at least give us the affected ones some forms of scholarships and not raise the tuition next year or something. I know this is not fair for the students that are graduating this semester because they won\u2019t gain anything from this, but they maybe could still receive the scholarship if it ever happen. In the end, I\u2019m just hoping for the best and fairness. Thanks!\ud83e\udd13",

However, I think out of all the things crow has said/promised, housing refund isn't my personal biggest concern. \n\nI did start actively reading Crow's statements on how campus services were number 48 on the list he has, and he has said some things that were bullshit. So I agree, he definitely does not care about the students as much as we'd like to believe.  \n\nI'm done arguing about this tonight though. Stay safe my friend.",

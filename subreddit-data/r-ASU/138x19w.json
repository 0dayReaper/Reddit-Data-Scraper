As long as you stay close to the campus area and travel with friends at night you should be fine. If you are looking for an apartment I am transferring my lease for The Carmin next year. It is right next to campus and a streetcar that goes around the campus. I've never had any problems in this area. It has a private bed and bath. Message me if interested!!",

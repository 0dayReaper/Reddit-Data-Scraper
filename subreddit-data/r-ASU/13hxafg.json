Her lectures are at a fast paced so there will be a lot of extra studying outside of class. She has office hours that are helpful. Make sure you do all of the homework because that will basically make or break your grade.",

Concept checks were all discussed in class, and tons of extra credit. Here lectures were fast, but nothing you won\u2019t be able to understand. 10/10 would highly recommend (I ended up with an A+).",

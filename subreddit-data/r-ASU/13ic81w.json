    "postText": "So I thought that my aid (fed grant and loans) would cover this semester but apparently it's not PER session, it's PER semester... so I went over the credits/amt (13 cred total) and I now owe $3600 to ASU and my enrollment and transcripts on hold until I pay that over due balance.\n\nI honestly did not find ASU to be user friendly online, nor did I learn that much tbh, they don't actually consider students with full time jobs when it comes to assignments and the amount of work (this is my experience tho). \n\nSo for Spring I took EBG 102, BIO 182, MAT 117 and OLG 120, which is why I have a balance. Nobody ever told me I would go over my aid at any point when speaking to a coach about when or how to register for my classes.\n\nSo I wanted to transfer schools. I applied to University of Florida since I live in that state but i might apply to a community college instead since its cheaper;, also because ASU wants to raise tuition by 3% for non-residents and I already have almost 20K in loans for just one year here. But I can't obtain the transcripts cause I owe them.\n\nI called the number on the hold noticed and they told me I could either pay it off by myself, whether immediately to get my transcript or get a payment arrangement which would F me over either way cause paying 3K would take more than a year to pay off and continue school. Or get a private student loan to pay it off. They also said to apply for 2 summer classes or 6 credits with 1K subsidized loan, but why even do that? \n\nSo my question is, should I just get the student private loan to pay it off and get my transcripts? If so, do I have to start paying on the loan immediately or would continuing studies at another institution apply to the pay after graduation thing??\n\nThis is my first time dealing with anything like this. Sorry if I'm ignorant or seem condescending it's not my intention what so ever I'm just tired cause there's always something. Biggest scam in America.",

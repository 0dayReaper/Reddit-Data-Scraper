I have not done anything to cause damage to any of my walls and suspect they have formed as a result of seasonal expansion/contraction, as they normally do. Has anyone had similar experiences and have you been charged for such a thing at move-out?",

When you check out of your dorm, make sure you do a regular checkout with a scheduled walkthrough, not an express checkout (if you do express checkout you waive your right to contest charges from damages). During your walkthrough, if they bring it up then explain the situation. They shouldn\u2019t charge you for regular wear and tear, and you can bring up photos and/or your maintenance request as evidence. You can contest charges if they do try to charge you.",

When you first arrive before you move anything in document every piece of damage by taking photos for proof. Most places will have a form for you to fill out specifically for this but if they don't ask",

The ASU owned buildings are older and we typically were super understanding about things like that. I worked in an ASU owned building and we pretty much only charged for things where it really seemed like someone had to try to break/damage something. But the ACC properties (barrett, vista, tooker, manzanita) can be pretty harsh with their billing since they are owned by a third property.",

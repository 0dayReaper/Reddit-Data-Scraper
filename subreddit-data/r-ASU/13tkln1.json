You can request an alternate day to the one assigned, within that timeframe, but then you have to move in after 5pm and get no movers help. Welcomes start on Monday.\n\nIf you are moving into non-Freshman campus apartments, the dates to select your time start on Monday, 8/14. The portal to pick opens in late July.",

    "postText": "Hello, this is is my first session at ASU. I am an online student. \n\nI set up my direct deposit back in march. I copied and pasted the numbers from my bank into the form, the same way I've done for my work direct deposits. \n\nI have a Financial Aid refund that was supposed to deposited sometime this week. Was watching my finances page and my bank account like a hawk. Things are really, really tight for me right now. It said that they issued my refund via direct deposit on the 12th. \n\nToday in the afternoon I noticed something changed- next to direct deposit, it no longer said \"active\", it had the prompt for me to set it up. I immediately called the business office. The woman I spoke to told me that somehow my bank was unable to find my account. That they are now waiting for my bank to send the money back to them, and they will cut me a check and mail it me. \n\nI found this to be somewhat distressing. \n\nI asked her to read or send me the direct deposit information that they had, so I could see where this could have possibly gone wrong. She did not have access to that. I asked her how long this process would take. She said she didn't know, it depended on my bank, \"you can call ask them\".  I asked for some sort of transaction number I could give my bank so they could find out and she said they didn't have anything like that.  I asked how calling my bank would help then, since they get thousands of transactions a day, and according to ASU, this one couldn't be connected to me. So how would they be able to find out the status of it if I called? \n\n\"Oh\"\n\nSo now I don't know what to do other than wait and deal with the short term consequences. \n\nAnybody have any other suggestions for navigating this situation? Has this happened to anyone else? Should I call again tomorrow and try to talk to someone else? \n\nI hope everyone else's summer term is off to a less eventful start :')",

            "comment": "I think once they've decided to send you a paper check you can't get direct deposit for that transaction anymore. Not sure what happened with the bank, I've never heard of it happening to anyone I know. It's possible an extra space was copied and pasted along with your account and routing numbers that messed things up but usually most systems catch these on the form by denying unsupported characters.",

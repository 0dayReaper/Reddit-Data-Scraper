It was confirmed through UL email and speaking to support specialist. So you needed to enroll and lock into the course (by paying $25) before May 1st. You can read more about it on Sun Devil Connects fb group.\n\nHowever, I would suggest to reach out to UL because there still has not been an official announcement yet.",

ASU loses a lot of money if a tuition-paying student takes these instead of traditional o/i courses. I wish they would at least leave an option to take some of these with a higher end fee; particularly the math. The ability to keep trying and pay once you master the material is so beneficial for some students.",

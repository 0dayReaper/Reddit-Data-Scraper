    "postText": "I am joining ASU for fall 23 for MS CS program. Interms of class selection, most courses seem to be unavailable as there are no non reserved seats available. Should i expect more seats to be opened up or this is it? I can see some available classes like CSE 550 Combinatorial Algorithms and Intractability and CSE 552 Randomized and Approximation Algorithms but they seem incredibly hard to take in the same semester especially in the first semester when there are already so many adjustments going on as an international student. Can anybody who has taken these courses give me some feedback on how difficult they are?",

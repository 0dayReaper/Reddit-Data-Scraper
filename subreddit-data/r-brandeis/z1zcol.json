I wanna double major in Health science and international relations (i don\u2019t remember what brandies call these two majors)\n\n2. Is it easy for a brandies student to find internships? Apparently a lot people never heard of Brandeis before and i\u2019m kinda worried about name \u201cclout\u201d at diff companies or other work places \n\n3. Is off campus housing an option? I\u2019m not a big dorm person but idk if there are apartments or houses around the school. If there are apartments or houses, is it walkable to school or do i need cars or buses? \n\n4. This is def an opinion thing but how socially dead is Brandeis? I love clubs and I feel like I would fit in with the \u201cweird people\u201d (according to diff reviews), but is it true there r A LOT of people transferring out each year? \n\ntysm, i really like this school and wanna get a better idea of this place!!! \ud83e\udd0d",

            "comment": "There are a lot of double majors. It\u2019s not everybody though. How hard it is to handle is going to vary based on what the majors are. I don\u2019t know specifically about HSSP and IGS, but I would bet that it\u2019s doable.\n\nI can\u2019t speak to internships, but we do have a career center that will help you get one, and I have friends who have internships.\n\nOff-campus housing is an option after your second year. But also keep in mind that not all on-campus housing is traditional residence halls. That\u2019s what it is for first-years, but after that, you can choose a traditional residence hall, a suite, or an apartment.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of clubs, there\u2019s something for everyone. And everyone\u2019s really passionate about what they do. I honestly think all the talk about transferring is just people complaining, I only know one person who actually transferred out, and she got into an ivy lol\n\nHope to see you in the fall!",

People know of it don't worry.\n3. N/A no experience\n4. A bit.  Once you find friends though, it's great.  There's no dartys or anything but there's quite a bit going on socially if you have people.  Like the other person said, people just complain.\n\nPM with any other questions :).  Looking forward to seeing you in the fall",

            "comment": "&gt; How bad would a commute from the Cambridge area to Waltham be? \n\nA lot of my colleagues live in Somerville near Porter station and take the train in, commuter rail is a 20-min long ride. Brandeis has its own station connected to the university so your walk to campus is like 5-10 minutes from the station. Only major downsides are that the roundtrip fare is like $16 (I think) so it's pretty expensive, and train comes like once an hour.\n\n&gt;Also, what is the vibe of Waltham?\n\nUhh, it's fine I guess. Relatively safe in terms of violent crime/theft (at least I feel safe, and I leave my amazon deliveries on the porch, I go running etc.), but there's also there's a fair amount of can-collectors who go through your recycling, and homeless people abound in public spaces, so if that bothers you I guess that's a factor. Only things that rub me about Waltham is that there's really good expensive restaurants, and then some really mediocre restaurants that are also relatively expensive, while there's a scarcity of good, cheap, fast-casual restaurants that I really yearn for as a busy student. Also there's an incredible number of pizza shops and none of them are really that great, some of them are awful. Same goes for hair stylists/barbers. I've chosen to live here because it's the best balance of cost economy, there's enough to do around here, and it's well connected to Boston via transit. There's also some great green space around like Prospect hill park, Western greenway, and the path along the charles that are great if you like running/going outdoors. \n\n&gt;What is the level of rigor like in science and physics? \n\nI'm in the neuroscience program and I while I say it's \"high quality\" I do think it's a bit more forgiving compared to other programs I've heard of. Not sure what the physics dept is like in terms of coursework, maybe it's entirely different. Definitely don't see doctorate-level students failing classes or getting kicked out unless they can't find a lab. \n\n&gt;How are the physics graduate courses? Is it common for students to take courses at other universities in the area (e.g. Harvard/MIT)?\n\nTaking courses at Harvard/MIT happens but rarely. It's a hassle to take the commuter rail to porter and then red line to harvard/MIT. If I really wanted to take a class there I guess I could do it but I'd avoid if possible.",

Taking classes at BU, Tufts or BC is super easy, though.\n\nAlso, regarding the commute from Cambridge/Somerville/etc., it entirely depends on when you're making it, especially if you're driving. Five years ago, you could beat the morning rush by leaving any time before 7:00. Now, you'd have to leave around 6:00. It's getting worse. If you're only driving between rush hours, it's not a big deal, but that won't probably be the case for a grad student at Brandeis. Take the train from Porter/North Station and that's moot, but yeah, not cheap.",

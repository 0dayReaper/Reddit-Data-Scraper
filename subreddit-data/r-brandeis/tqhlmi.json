It seems pretty chill and the musical theatre energy is strong as hell so I think I\u2019ll be okay lol. But lemme know :)!",

            "comment": "LGBT alum here! I graduated about four years ago, so it was pre-covid, if that makes a difference. I found it super chill. Lots of space to be myself, no one questioned my identity or made me feel out of place. Made a lot of LGBT friends, and for the first time in my life I didn't feel super alone. Tons of LGBT students, staff, and faculty on campus, across all departments and activities. And you're right, the musical theatre energy is epic. Feel free to touch base if you have any questions! Happy to share more about the Brandeis experience.",

Across all departments it\u2019s very accepting, and a lot of people here are openly lgbtq.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s some room for improvement: culturally, not a great deal of outwardly expressed pride compared to other universities, and no free HIV &amp; sti testing clinics provided on campus.",

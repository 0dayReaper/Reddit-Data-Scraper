    "postText": "I want to go to med school.\n\n**Major: Biochemistry**\n\nWhich one is stronger academically? Which one has better opportunities for pre-med? I have been researching both and can't put my finger on one. Academics and pre-med opportunities are the most important thing to me.\n\nBoth cost me a fortune-34k$.\n\n# Brandeis pros:\n\n* higher ranked\n* better academics?\n* better clinical/research opportunities?\n\n# Brandeis cons:\n\n* not in Texas, which is somewhat important to me as my family is in Texas. However, I don't mind leaving far away from them.\n* How cold is it there? I have never been to Boston, please describe to me the weather and atmosphere of the city\n* more competitive overall\n\n# Trinity pros:\n\n* near family\n* less competitive and less stressful environment\n* undergraduate-focused\n* better pre-health advising program\n\n# Trinity cons:\n\n* there are a lot of required courses I need to take which are outside of my major. I am not a big fan of that.",

I went to get my phd in a Stem field after Brandeis and it prepared me very well, especially the research that I did. I went to a very well ranked phd program and everyone I know from Brandeis who did phds or MDs went to good places \n\nI think at the end of the day it might be best to think about wherever you will be happy and motivated to study since I think that\u2019s the most important for med school, just getting the best grades possible",

I don't mind the weather here, it's usually relatively mild but hot and humid and the summer and usually in the 20s and 30s with snow in the winter. As far as competition, at least from what I've heard in the stem classes, it is somewhat competitive but idk how it stacks up against other schools. Good luck!",

Family can be an important support structure. Premed academics  can tend to be bad at every school because it\u2019s just the intro science classes but if you\u2019re majoring in biochem reach out to the head of that department and ask yourself if you want to work with this person for four years. If you want to do research while in undergrad (everyone who can should) then I would find people who you want to work with. All told the decision doesn\u2019t matter that much. Undergrad is undergrad. Get a 3.8+. Try to author a research paper. Enjoy yourself as much as you can.",

Brandeis worked out really well for me academically and could potentially give a slight edge for more local med schools who are familiar with 'Deis, but overall science GPA and MCAT are important. Extracurriculars/research can be had anywhere. Unless you are trying to get an MD/PhD the quality of research doesn't matter too much.",

    "postText": "hello! apologies if this has already been asked, but does anyone know of any \"easy\" classes that would fulfill 2+ core requirements (preferably humanities-related core classes). i'm planning on double majoring, so i don't think I'll be able to take all of the classes i want to take that are humanities-related (that would also fulfill some requirements) :(",

            "comment": "Two things: one, it\u2019s extremely unlikely that a course (even in AMST or HIST where you\u2019d find two-for-one courses) qualifies for more than 2 core requirements as well as satisfying major requirements. Two, even if a class is listed as qualifying for n number of requirements, typically it only ends up counting towards one or two. For instance, I took HIST 80A in freshman year trying to do what you\u2019re doing and I only ended up getting 2/4 listed. I\u2019d say focus on classes you want to take and you will fill the cores easily - we go to a lib arts college, not mit unfortunately :(",

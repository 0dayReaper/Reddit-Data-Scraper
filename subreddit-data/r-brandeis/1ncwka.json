    "postText": "Heya! So I'm a high school senior thinking of applying Early Decision to Brandeis for a triple major in Psychology, Queer Studies, and Creative Writing. I know a lot about the general programs at Brandeis (and am really, really enthusiastic about all the clubs and interdisciplinary crossover I hear about) but am...kind of nervous, too. What, specifically, are the creative writing programs like at Brandeis? What are the outstanding issues of the campus? Thanks so much in advance for even just reading.",

However, just wanted to point out that according to http://www.brandeis.edu/registrar/bulletin/provisional/courses/subjects/6350.html, Queer Studies is only available as a minor.",

I came into brandeis expecting to study and have some fun, but honestly, i've made such strong relationships at this school within only a few months! It's the kind of place where it's legitimately impossible to not make friends because everyone is so unique, and awesome, and kind and ahh\n\nsuper duper great school. There's so much more to say about it and if you want me to go into finer details about some things, PM me and i will be totally happy to answer!",

    "postText": "I did some research and created [a site](https://coda.io/@collegetuition/brandeis-university-tuition) for visualizing college costs and stats at Brandeis. After listening to the Numbers Geek podcast, I was curious about how tuition is being used, how much each student costs the university, and revenue generated per student. This sent me down a rabbit hole of visualizing admissions and enrollment data on this page as well. Would love your thoughts!",

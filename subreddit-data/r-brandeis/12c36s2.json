    "postText": "I'm a DnD player and I know Brandeis has a LARP club but there isn't much info on them so I don't know if the Dnd club falls under that umbrella. Like I know most LARP people play DnD, but not every Dnd player is a LARPer -- so I don't want to go in expecting people to epically fail at rolling when they're actually rolling around the ground, pretending to snipe some epic invisible armadillos. My favorite part of halloween is the free candy and tomfoolery, not the battle of finding a good costume. \n\nSo is the LARP club into Dnd and if not, where can I find Dnd campaigns near Waltham?",

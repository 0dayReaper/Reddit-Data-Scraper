    "postText": "I like almost everything about Brandeis, from its academics to its location, and the only thing that\u2019s holding me back from possibly ED2ing is their \"lack of social life.\"I have seen many people talk about their transferring experiences because of this, and I want to know more about this issue.\u00a0\n\nWhen people say it\u2019s socially dead, do they mean no parties and tailgates, or are the students there unwilling to make friends with others?\n\nI am obviously not expecting it to be a state school type of environment; I like joining clubs and possibly joining Greek life in college. I currently live in the midwest, so most of my life consists of having 2-4 friends and exploring most places by myself. My dream college social experience is honestly pretty simple, study, club meetings and possible work on the week days and party or go out on the weekends. Is this possible at Brandeis? I am apart of many groups (hobbies &amp; identify) so I thought it would be easy for me to make friends that share those things? I\u2019m just very confused on what people mean when they say it\u2019s socially dead? \n\nPS: I am in band and orchestra but i\u2019m not music major, so if Brandeis has music groups for non music majors that would be \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29",

            "comment": "i\u2019m from the midwest as well, from the sounds of it brandeis would be good for you. it\u2019s easy to make friends off the brandeis freshman page and form a friend group from there, you just usually have to go out of your way to make friends and people tend to be really cliquey. It\u2019s a small school and it the people make it feel a bit highschool ish. I\u2019m transferring to be more in the city, for my major, and because i don\u2019t enjoy the atmosphere of brandeis, however, for some people it\u2019s a great fit for others. I would say just give it a shot it\u2019s a great school academically and you always have the possibility of transferring. I gave it a shot and it just wasn\u2019t for me. Party wise, there\u2019s parties every weekend and it\u2019s easy to join greek life here. When people say it\u2019s socially dead i think they mean how small the school is and how everyone has their head in their books majority of the time and hardly leave campus or go out. (just my experiences)",

I was a part of greek life and also multiple clubs/groups etc and feel like I was able to get it all.\n\nI think by socially dead I think most people mean that the average Brandesian is a bit nerdier than what you'll find at most schools, but nothing worse than that!",

I joined multiple clubs (became president for one of them) and am in greek life as well and became incredibly close with the members within my org which is essentially the only reason I didn't transfer haha. I also met a lot of people that play instruments casually as well and I frequently meet up and play with them as well!",

I was hanging out with different groups of people every day but I didn't feel totally myself. I was friends with a lot of the brothers in the org before I joined, but after joining greek life, I became a lot closer with all of them and made what I consider to be lifelong friends with a lot of the guys in my pledge class and in the org so I didn't end up transferring. A decent amount of people transfer/think of transfering from brandeis for a multitude of reasons (bland campus, shitty food, social scene, community) and for me it was a combination of those things as well. But I had finally found a group of people I genuinely wanted to hang with everyday.",

Consider:\n\n-does it have all the majors/fields of study you want?\n\n-why do you favor liberal arts education over something like a BS, engineering, or management degree?\n\n-how does brandeis position you to build your future? Is it close to/does it offer extra curricular learning experiences like internships for the career you\u2019re interested in?\n\n-how would you fit in with social life on campus? Are there clubs, groups, or preprofessional orgs you look forward to joining?",

Is it difficult to get in or is there another reason little people are pursuing it. If anyone has been able to join this program can you talk about literally anything good or bad about this program.

I think). I am interested in the program but might need to do further exploring once on campus.",

Additionally most people who are dead-set on engineering just go to a school that offers it",

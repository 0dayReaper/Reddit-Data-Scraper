    "postText": "\n\ni got accepted to both schools and the aid is similar.\n\n\n\n I Want to study engineering and wpi will offer that,but if i go to Brandeis I will have study science and probably transfer for engineering.\n\nWhat attracts me to Brandeis is the amazing research and professors,but from what i have heard brandies doesn't have that much social life/school spirit. WPI does.\n\nWPI has better dorms and food,but Brandeis has a better location. The campus is about equal.\n\n\nwhat would you pick?",

I love both so much but Brandeis\u2019 location is just perfect for me and the religious aspect of Brandeis is far more appealing for me than WPI. If I don\u2019t get off the waitlist I\u2019ll be at WPI but if I do I\u2019ll be at Brandeis.",

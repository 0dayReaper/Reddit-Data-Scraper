            "comment": "I was a midyear, but I didn't do any of the study abroad options. From what I've heard from friends, they weren't that worth it; the Florence program was extremely small/lonely, and the London program was a bit of a zoo of popular people and partiers, with subpar course offerings (the program is through Arcadia, which a lot of people didn't like).\n\nIn terms of catching up with courses you'd probably have better luck just using AP credits or taking courses outside Brandeis your first semester (summer courses, community college etc.), as long as you get the courses pre-approved by the registrar.\n\nExperience-wise, I thought I did better socially as a midyear (surprisingly). Unless you're pretty sociable and imagine you'll have no trouble making a ton of friends super quickly, I found that being a midyear among a smaller pool of people at orientation (about 100 students) helped me meet more people and feel more comfortable (fall orientation can turn into a massive 1000+ person party very quickly). Assuming you get placed in Village for housing (like most midyears), that's also definitely a plus, as the normal freshman housing can be pretty unpleasant. Feel free to pm me if you have more questions!",

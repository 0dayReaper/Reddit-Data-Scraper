    "postText": "Anyone have that relatable moment when they put da ting in da bag? Please omnifax your responses to David Marbrook at 143 Nightingale Lane, Arflington, Dubai (United Arab Emersons). \n\nIf you have any questions, please email Brandeis/admissions/rubberchildren.gov for any questions if you have any. \n\nEven when they do the thing that we told them was not what they should do according to what we told them they should do, it hasn\u2019t been much of a revelation with regard to the fact that what we told them should be done has not been done in the long run and that\u2019s just the pot calling the kettle back. You know, the kettle calls, the pot does not pick up. So the pot when it realizes that the kettle calls it, well, the pot , it, calls the kettle back. But what we told them should be done has not been done in much of a satisfactory manner (fiduciaries notwithstanding).\n\nLastly, I\u2019d like to welcome our keynote speaker for tonight: Mr. T.J. Huggins!\n\nT.J.: \u201cHi r/Brandeis! I\u2019m T.J. Huggins, 3x all pro polo forward and 5x Dovedy cup champion! I\u2019m here to remind you all to water your expectations, for the plant of us all is growing inside god\u2019s eye? Well, that\u2019s about all the time I have for you today! Tootle-ooty!\u201d\n\nDamn, that Mr. Huggins always be sayin \u201ctootle-ooty\u201d that\u2019s like his catchphrase. So in conclusion, Louis D. Brandeis once said: \u201cPut it in the box where the rest of the tools are.\u201d",

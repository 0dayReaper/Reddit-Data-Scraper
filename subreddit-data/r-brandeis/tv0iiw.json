If you go between 5 PM til closing time, you\u2019ll be sharing the two squat racks with at least 4 people. If you go in the mornings before 10, its all free typically. \n\nI used to go at 7 AM first semester due to class scheduling. It was sometimes completely empty. It was also usually the same 10 or so people lol",

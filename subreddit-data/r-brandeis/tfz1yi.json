    "postText": "hi! I don\u2019t rlly use Reddit lmao but i\u2019m a little desperate. \n\nI am a midyear this year, and I\u2019m not the most outgoing person. I think having orientation and classes online for the first couple of weeks had not helped, but I\u2019m having trouble trying to find my place or meet new people. I\u2019m getting a little nervous cause it\u2019s Mid-March, and I don\u2019t really want to stay pent up in my dorm anymore. \n\nA lot of people have already made friend groups, and trying to squeeze in feels a little awkward. I also want to join some clubs but I feel really nervous reaching out. \n\nI was just wondering if any past mid years or anyone else has any advice for navigating the social life on campus or making friends! Thank you :)",

So basically you can do school somewhere else for the first half, go abroad (Italy and London), work (which I did), or just relax! it\u2019s really weird at first!",

Since the campus is small, you won't need a car to get to classes, but be sure to coordinate your trips home in advance with public transportation.",

You might not think you need it, but Brandeis (at least currently) allows you to bring food back to your dorm, so being able to store/heat up food is useful. Yes dorms should have a kitchen somewhere, but that fridge will get disgusting so fast, and people can be jerks and might move/dump your stuff to fit their own in.",

    "postText": "Assalamu alaykum, I\u2019m not a student at Brandeis, but younger sister goes there. I was informed of the bus rollover incident by my mother, who has informed me that she\u2019s okay. Though my sister is okay, I know that 28 people aren\u2019t. If you were affected by the accident, I hope things get better for you, and that hopefully your semester ends well. If you weren\u2019t affected, I still hope you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re brilliant people with a bright future ahead of you and something as terrible as this should never have happened. \n\nI know it might be odd that I\u2019m posting here. However, though I might not have experienced a catastrophe of this scale, I do know what it\u2019s like to worry about making it through the day all too well, and no one should have to worry about that\u2014no one.\n\nI wish all of you well. You\u2019ve made it to one of the top 50 schools in the country. You\u2019re brilliant. You\u2019re special. Though there are some times when things may seem hopeless, there\u2019s always a light\u2014there\u2019s always someone out there who cares about you. \n\nSincerely,\n\nA Sibling of a Fellow Student",

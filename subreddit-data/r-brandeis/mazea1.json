    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo I am a freshman in my second semester \\\\ and I am planning on majoring in business and psychology. the thing is that even though I'm already almost halfway into my psych major, I have only taken thus far micro and social psych for  business. I do am planning on taking financial accounting next semester once I am in person (been online this whole time), but I am nervous I am lagging behind. what is your opinion on this? should I \"overload\" next semester or is it fine if I just take  financial in the fall and then fundamentals + finance next spring?

Started financial accounting in the fall of my second year and was able to complete all the major and university requirements on time! DM me if you have any other specific questions.",

I rushed 2nd semester and had no regrets.\n\nPledging a fraternity is a bit larger of a time commitment, but it should be treated effectively as another extracurricular. If you are an athlete, I'd recommend not pledging during your active season.\n\nI had a wonderful time in greek life and you will too! Just make sure to join other clubs and activities around campus so you don't get stuck in the bubble :)",

I joined first semester of my sophomore year, and the freshmen in my pledge class noted how they didn't really have any friends outside of the org/greek life after our process was over. They've branched out since, but I would suggest rushing second semester or even a sophomore that way you can find a non-greek life social circle before committing a decent amount of time and energy into an org.",

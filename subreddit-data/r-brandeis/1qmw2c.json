If you changed the text to say *\"as in, would the coach allow a runner to join if he hadn't been intentionally recruited\"*\n\nOr, to change the title to say, **\"Does Brandeis's Cross-Country Team Requite A Minimum Time?\"**\n\n\n..but yea, just look up meet times online and compare times w/existing team members, then speak with the coach and/or members of the team",

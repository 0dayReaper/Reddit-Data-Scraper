Couldn't attend any private institution without a hell of a lot of finaid. I'm an MLK Scholar, which means all my need is paid for--so my financial experience here has been generally very good. I'm still walking out with student loans because my mom had a good year and got more commission, which apparently doesn't translate into paying debts, but into more money for college--which sucks. But in general, Brandeis is one of the most ridic generous institutions if you need it. ",

I come from a single-parent household, my mom makes around 30k/year, and I graduated with about 20k total in federal loans. I got work study throughout my time at Brandeis, which helped a lot, and is something you should definitely talk to the financial aid office if they didn't offer it to you already. I was also lucky to receive merit- and need-based aid, and if you and/or your parents talk to the office, you might be able to wiggle into a little more. Another plus is that whatever Brandeis offers you in aid your first year there they will offer you at least that amount for the rest of your time there.  ",

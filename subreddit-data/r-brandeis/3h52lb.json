            "comment": "I graduated from undergrad a few years ago, but am still very involved as a volunteer and am earning a graduate degree part time. YMMV.\n\n&gt;Is there a lot of drug use on campus?\n\n\nNot in such a way that you can't avoid it when you want to, but if you want to, there's a lot of drugs around. Weed seemed more ubiquitous than alcohol in my social circles.\n\n&gt; How diverse is the student population.\n\nBrandeis was founded by the Jewish community and has a very Jewish reputation. While less than half of the student body is Jewish, only half of them are particularly religious. We have a large international community, in particular students from China and India, as well as many Jewish students from Latin America. The black, latino, and Muslim communities are relatively small, but complete forces of nature on campus. #Blacklivesmatter is a constant discussion on campus, but at the same time like many New England private schools, most of the students are white and lack a lot of context.\n\n&gt;Do you like Brandeis? Why?\n\nCouldn't love it more - it was my first choice when applying to college (from out of state somewhere where no one had really heard of Brandeis and certainly few had ever applied) and the student body is why I stay involved as an alum. If you are someone who throws yourself into your passions, wants to get involved in something (be it student government, clubs, activist groups, one of the 13 a cappella groups, athletics, etc), and are either liberal or OK being one of the few conservatives on campus and having your opinions challenged, then you'll love it. But it's not for everyone. Many people get worn down by the overachievement that is driven by the student body. People aren't competitive in a cutthroat way, but it's easy to feel competitive when all of your friends are a triple major, double minor starring in a play and also a club leader. Brandeis's political bent was absolutely why I came here - I grew up in one of the most conservative parts of the US so Brandeis' social justice mission was a big part of the draw. While I hate that Brandeis gets fairly monotonously liberal on most issues (except Israel) because no one benefits from preaching to the choir, it is what it is.\n\n&gt;What are some popular recreational activities?\n\nThere are more than 200 clubs ranging from political organizations to cheese club and arts groups to student government and everything in between. It's hard to say what's most popular because people find their niche and it becomes important to them. The Princeton Review just ranked Brandeis as the college most engaged in community service, and that is definitely true. We have 20+ community service organizations as well as most clubs and groups doing some kind of service during the year.\n\nSome really popular events are 24 Hour Musical (students audition and then are given 24 hours to learn lines and music, build the set, and create costumes of a musical), Liquid Latex (students perform skits in body paint), Culture X (cultural/ethnic clubs put on a series of performances), Festival of the Arts, Break the Fast dinner after Yom Kippur, our spring concert called SpringFest. \n\n&gt;What do you recommend for getting accepted?\n\nShow interest in coming here - try to schedule either a visit or an interview with an alum in your area. The admissions office takes my recommendations into consideration when I interview. Also, show that you're a good \"fit.\" Show in your essay as well as in your extracurriculars that you are engaged in some way with social justice initiatives - community service is a must. Even better if you show how you took initiative to be a leader.\n\nObviously, your grades should be good as well. Brandeis removed the requirement to submit ACT/SAT scores a few years ago, but they still matter if you did well. \n",

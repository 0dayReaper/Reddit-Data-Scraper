    "postText": "Hello. My son will be transferring into Brandeis in January as a second semester Freshman (1 semester at a different school just completed). Looking to get him a gift card or two to local places which are walkable from campus and are places students like to go. Coffee shop type places may be best but casual restaurants also would be great to know. I welcome any suggestions and thank you for any replies. RANDOM LATE UPDATE TO THIS POST: In case this turns up in a search or anything, be aware that the on-campus Einstein Bagels does not accept Einstein Bagel gift cards. Of course.\n",

Moody street is a 15-20 minute walk away from campus and has lots of interesting restaurants as well within a half mile radius. Last time I checked there's an Einstein Brothers Bagel place on campus, hopefully a student can confirm if that's still there. Hope this helps!\n\n(P.s. is your username a reference to the Grateful Dead lyricist?)",

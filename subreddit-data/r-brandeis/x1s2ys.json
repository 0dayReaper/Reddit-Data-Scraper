I'm hoping to place out of Chinese; speak it fluently and can read pretty well, but don't have the best writing skills. Would it even be possible to place out? I'm considering doing this before our next fall semester. Thanks!",

I think it was fill in the blanks, picking between tenses, etc. You don't have to write an essay or anything. Sounds like you'll be fine!\n\nDon't sweat it too much, though. I didn't test out, but tested up. The level it placed me at was below my actual language level, but I spoke with the professor about it and she was fine bumping me up a class. Hope that helps!",

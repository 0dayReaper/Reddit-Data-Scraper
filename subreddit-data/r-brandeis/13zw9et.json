I am saying this because I saw many Reddit posts regarding a dead social circle and the atmosphere not being good.\n\nDoes Brandeis have a high rate of people enrolling in Masters in an Ivy League or a top-tier University?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a current politics major going into my senior year, I like the department and think I\u2019ve gotten a lot out of it. I haven\u2019t met a professor I dislike or taken a class, outside of intro courses, that was disappointing. IGS seems to be quite a popular major so I assume it\u2019s pretty good. Can\u2019t speak to how they pay post-grad but your major doesn\u2019t mean so much to employers when you\u2019re in the social sciences. \n\nThe social scene at Brandeis is strange but it\u2019s certainly not dead, it\u2019s just a little difficult. My experience (coming in fall 2020) has been most people aren\u2019t on the look out for new friends, they find a group and kinda just stick there. So if you go the normal route and join clubs, meet people in your hall, talk to other students in your classes, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t make friends and have a healthy and large social group, you just have to take the initiative. My experience has consistently been people are nice, just not outgoing. \n\nAgain I\u2019m still in undergrad and don\u2019t have many friends going right to masters but Brandeis has a good reputation and plenty of well connected profs, so it certainly won\u2019t be a roadblock if you have your sights set on Ivys.",

            "comment": "I double majored in politics and IGS with minors in environmental science and Latin American studies. My plan was to go on to immigration law or the Foreign Service. The recession and glut of lawyers prevented the first one and health issues prevented the second.  \n\n\nI hit 6 figures about a decade out of college, but that was in part to staying at a low(er) paying job due to the health insurance. Now I make close to $300K between salary, bonus, and stock benefits in my mid-30s. I doubled my salary alone by leaving the nonprofit world, and would likely be making more had I started in the private sector right out of undergrad/grad school.  My work is both unrelated to my majors from a professional standpoint and entirely related because of the value of a liberal arts degree. I also got my master's from Brandeis in digital marketing (the graduate professional school) through tuition remission.   \n\n\nMy closest friends at Brandeis went on to go to grad school at places like Harvard (several JDs), Northwestern, Columbia (JD, MD, journalism, and a few other areas), NYU, MIT, and more. We're coming up on our 15th Reunion and I'm still good friends with a lot of my Brandeis friends despite none of them staying in the Boston area with me.   \n\n\nAs far as the social scene, it really just depends on what you want. If you want a party atmosphere, Brandeis probably isn't the place for you. If you want an occasional party but also prefer your smaller group of friends, Brandeis is likely more your speed. People at \\*all\\* schools tend to transfer after their first year because it's a rough transition for a lot of folks. Some people went to Brandeis and didn't realize that the social scene was more serious and low key or didn't fully understand the Jewish element (you hear people say they transferred because it was too Jewish and others because it wasn't Jewish enough), but a solid number also transfer because they didn't find their group their first year and blame Brandeis for that. \n\nFor me, Brandeis was a breath of fresh air because I'm introverted and the world doesn't tend to cater to introverts. Brandeis attracts a lot of introverts, and for the first time I didn't feel nuts because I didn't want to go out every night or be surrounded by people all the time. That's not to say extroverts can't do well as well (hello, fraternities and sororities), but it may be jarring to some who are used to a more extroverted environment.",

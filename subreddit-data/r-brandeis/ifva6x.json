Just wondering if people found the online format worthwhile, as well as the content? \n\nThe courses fit my goals better than some of the other MA-based colleges/universities with MS programs available to working students. I will be attending an upcoming webinar session to get more information, but that\u2019s obviously not the \u201creal\u201d take since it\u2019s coming from admissions. \n\nThanks so much to everyone for any feedback they have on the program!",

Rather than typical semester, it is broken up into two shorter length segments. I believe each set of courses was 9 weeks instead of 14 weeks. For me, I wanted more time to absorb the materials. Classes are also only scheduled in the spring  and fall, so the entire program takes two years as you take summers off.\n\nI am actually in my last semester at Emerson now pursing the Digital Marketing and Data Analytics graduate program. It goes straight through from spring to spring - so the long way I have had off was three weeks for the Christmas/holiday break. It has been a lot of work, but I will say that I have made some good friends/connections along the way and the professors have all been accessible and flexible to the students, since we are all largely working full time still. If a graduate degree is something your still considering, I\u2019d encourage you to consider the program at Emerson. Feel free to PM me if you have other questions!",

One of the biggest criteria for my choice of an online graduate degree is for it to be from a Top 50 nationally ranked university and Brandeis is 34 so that was my thinking. In your opinion does that high ranking reflect in this Marketing degree?",

My decision came down to how smooth/welcoming the application process was, in addition to the cost. \n\nI have felt that the teachers were educated, though online learning is always a challenge. \n\nPlease don\u2019t also quote me in Brandeis being two years, though I distinctly remember that being one of the pitfalls for me. I did not want to have to acclimate myself again each fall after a long summer break.",

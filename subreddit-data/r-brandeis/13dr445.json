    "postText": "If you are moving out of your dorm, or graduating, we ask you to consider donating what you don't need or would otherwise throw away for urban public school students who are entering college next year.\n\nAt this point, we would accept clothes and beddings (bed sheets, comforters, etc.). Don't worry too much about the condition, we will sort through them and take appropriate\u00a0actions. If you are interested, please email [sar.kavanaugh@gmail.com](mailto:sar.kavanaugh@gmail.com). Thank you!",

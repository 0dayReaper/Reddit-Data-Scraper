    "postText": "Hi everyone! I wanted to get some insight from other students who may have been accepted as community college transfer applicants. Quickly approaching the final stretch here at Bristol Community College; as a Business Administration Student thus far I have achieved a 3.89 GPA. I am also a part of the Commonwealth Honors Program and am thoroughly involved with groups and activities on campus. I served 2 full semesters as the Chair of Finance on the Student Senate; I helped to establish a nationally accredited chapter of Active Minds on our campus while serving as the chapter's Co-President; I am a sitting member of two very impactful committees at our school-the Honors Advisory Board and BCC's Operation Council- and last semester I was invited to, and eventually completed a Leadership Academy that was run by the Multicultural Student Center.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs being accepted here a possibility? Something about Brandeis has just absolutely grabbed my attention, and it has quickly shot to the top of my shortlist of schools to apply to. However, I would not want to waste my time/money with the application process if being accepted as a transfer student is a long shot! TIA!",

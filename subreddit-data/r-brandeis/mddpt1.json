    "postText": "Hey my friend got a 1390 and we were thinking of trying to get a 4 person ridgewood. We're both going to be Juniors and heard that the process is different than it is was when we freshman/sophomores. Someone told us that if we tried for a Ridgewood and it wasn't available that we would lose our time that day and be pushed to the next day. I was wondering if anyone knew what the junior/senior process is and could help clarify it for me?",

I have a 1283 and I'm not sure that I will be able to get a ridge. If I were you I would have multiple backup plans. Good news is that a 1390 can almost definitely get you a Ziv which are still really nice suites.",

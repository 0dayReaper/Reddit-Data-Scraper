Could a current student tell me what the social scene is like and if it is easy to make friends on campus. Also, is there a lot to do on campus when youre not in class?",

Being a midyear doesn\u2019t prevent you from meeting people. Plus, most of the time, you'll be in classes with non-midyears, so it feels like the same class size. If you have AP credits or study during the Fall, you can still graduate Spring 27 if you want",

                            "comment": "I was in the \"worst dorm on campus\" (East Quad). It doesn't have AC, but many dorms don't and you just need to get a fan and grit your teeth when it's 100\u00ba out, which really isn't often (although unfortunately there was a heat wave during my second week on campus and it was miserable). Halls often smell like weed, but that's true in many locations and on many campuses, because college students are dumb and inconsiderate and can't manage their emotions without weed. Rooms are large enough to fit all of your stuff without an issue, assuming you're packing like a normal college student and not a crazy person with a shoe closet. It gets really stuffy in the winter (my roommate and I never needed to touch our heat because we were sweating even in the middle of the winter), but you can keep a window open. The main issue was just that it was sunken into this unattractive corner of the campus and you had to climb a hill to get literally anywhere and it was far from everything. But it was survivable (unless the smell of weed is debilitating for you, and that really depends on who's in your hall and who likes to smoke right outside your room).\n\nThat being said, one of the walls in my room was brick, which was a really cool aesthetic. It was more out of the way than many of the other dorms, but it's still on campus and fine. Our room didn't smell like weed most of the time, and when it did we'd either open the window to let the smell out, or close it if the smell was coming in from outside. Many of the dorms don't have AC anyway, so you being somewhere else wouldn't fix that. East really wasn't terrible; people just like to complain about stuff and they tend to be melodramatic about these things. And that's the worst dorm on campus.",

So most of my friends aren't midyears since the people in my hall are all (from what I recall) not midyears and a good amount of my classes have people from different years in them (i.e. juniors, seniors).\n\nThe dorms aren't horrendous (well, North isn't) in a way that's different from most colleges. The worst thing about the dorms, to me, is the people who leave a mess in the bathrooms or scream and run down the halls constantly, but those are issues at almost any dorm. Most dorms don't have a/c thanks to being in the Northeast, and it seems like you can't turn on the a/c yourself in those dorms, so you may want a small fan for hotter days or nights. But imho, not terrible for dorm living.",

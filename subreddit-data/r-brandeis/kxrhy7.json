            "comment": "Hi, I know it's been a while since you've posted but here are my two cents. I graduated in '19.\n\nLooking at courses offered in Spring 2021, there's not much you could take as a freshman. I do want to point out Prof. Ed Bayone. Students who love him LOVE him and would probably go to war for him, but students who don't click with his teaching style seem to abhor his class. I personally have had little exposure to him (he subbed for my professor for one period) yet he managed to make me feel like I won the lottery by not being his student. No disrespect to the man -- he's one of the most accomplished professors in Brandeis, but just a heads up.\n\nAnother suggestion I'd like to offer is to take BUS 51A: Introduction to Data Analytics with Excel. I don't believe this course was offered when I was still in Brandeis, but I would take that class in a heartbeat. Something I really wish I did better in Brandeis is learning Excel. Of course, if you're super into Excel and feel confident that you could learn it (or have already learned it) on your own, you're welcome to ignore this.\n\nECON 10A with Prof. Coiner was a delight  for me. ~~It doesn't seem like he's teaching the course this semester though.~~ I think he's actually retired! That's a shame, he's really a legend among Business/Econ kids.\n\nOtherwise, looking a little more ahead into your soph/junior/senior years, here's a list of courses that I took and either found them enjoyable or helpful in my current career, all from the [Business Major Requirements page](https://www.brandeis.edu/business/pdfs/updated-maj-reqs-fall-2020.pdf):\n\n* BUS 120A - Organizational Behavior w/ Prof. Sandra Cha\n* BUS 153A - Marketing Research w/ Prof. Jane Ebert\n* LGLS 189A - Business Law w/ Prof. Daniel Breen\n* BUS 89A - Work in the Global Business Environment w/ Prof. Detlev Suderow (you must be doing an internship DURING the semester to take this class)\n* CHIN 106B - Business Chinese and Culture w/ Prof. Yu Feng (if you decide to pick up Chinese only; there are Chinese pre-requisites for this class)\n* BUS 130A - Entrepreneurship and Innovation w/ Prof. Charles Reed\n* PSYC 34B - Social Psychology (I actually didn't take this class but heard very good things about it)\n\nAre you single majoring in Business? Not to put any kind of pressure on you, but to my knowledge most Brandeisians go down the double major or single major + minor path. If you have any other major/minors, that could dictate the kinds of classes you take as lots of courses count for multiple majors.\n\nYou could probably tell I'm not a very accounting/finance inclined person, so if that is your field of interest, I may not be the best person to give you recs. :P\n\nSorry for the long text, here's a TL;DR:\n\n* Consider not taking Business Fundamentals from Prof. Ed Bayone (if it's not too late already)\n* Consider BUS 51A\n* Consider the classes listed above\n* Take your other majors/minors into consideration if you have any",

I don't know what aspect of marketing you are drawn towards (marketing is an extremely diverse field), but I recommend the following:\n\n* BUS 120A - Organizational Behavior w/ Prof. Sandra Cha \n* BUS 152A - Marketing Management\n* PSYC 51A - Statistics\n* BUS 153A - Marketing Research w/ Prof. Jane Ebert \n* PSYC 34B - Social Psychology\n* Any other classes under \"Marketing\" in the [Business Major Req Page](https://www.brandeis.edu/business/pdfs/updated-maj-reqs-fall-2020.pdf)\n\nOB, Marketing Management, and Psych Stats are core classes you're going to have to take for your major/minor. I took OB with Prof. Cha and it ended up being one of my favorite classes I took at Brandeis. I also had a great prof for Stats but she doesn't teach at Brandeis anymore. I don't have a prof rec for Marketing Management.\n\nYou'll learn how to use a software called SPSS in Stats. It's an application that lets you perform statistical testing &amp; analysis. It's used by some professional marketers, and I personally leveraged my knowledge of SPSS to land a really nice internship. Marketing Research also teaches you how to use this program, and either class will prepare you well for the other. I always associated the term \"marketing\" with advertising &amp; PR, but I learned at Brandeis that it's really about statistics and data analysis.\n\nIf you're into the graphic design/advertising/PR/content creation aspects of marketing, I'm not sure if there are good classes for that. It's not my area of expertise, sorry.\n\nI listed Social Psych because it cross-fulfills Business &amp; Psych requirements.\n\nAny of the marketing specific classes should be good. I think I remember a friend telling me BUS 160A Competitive Strategy was a decent class.",

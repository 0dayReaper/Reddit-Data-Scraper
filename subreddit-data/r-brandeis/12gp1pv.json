You\u2019re most likely either going to be put in one of two freshman quads: North or Massel Quad. Both are fine, each with their pros and cons (I.e. North being closer to a lot of classes and having a lower chance of a forced triple, while Massel has an arguably better lounge and is right next to a dining hall).\n\nAnd then there\u2019s East quad. Since Brandeis loves to over-enroll, they can\u2019t fit all their freshman in the freshman quads, so they put the older freshman (i.e. gap years, people held back a grade, you get the point.) in East quad. East quad is where you don\u2019t want to be, for a variety of reasons. I was in East quad initially, but moved out after a month because I hated it. \n\nTLDR: you can\u2019t choose your housing, only preferences. The two freshman quads are both decent, but the quad for older freshman sucks.",

If you get into Composition, you will have to take that and then take UWS in the Spring or Fall semester of next year. \n\nHowever, when I came in as a freshman Fall 2016, you did have the option to repeal your placement into Composition. That may still be an option, so if you get into Composition, you can pursue that. Definitely no need to stress about it too much.",

I got there the first day and the prof or TA or whoever it was called me and two other people out in the hall. He said, \"you get an automatic A - this class can't teach you anything\" and sent us on our way. I don't know if they usually do that, but that's what happened to me.",

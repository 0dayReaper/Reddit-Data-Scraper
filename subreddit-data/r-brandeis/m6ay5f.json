    "postText": "I would like to avoid doing my Zoom classes in my room. What are the best places on campus where I can do Zoom classes and speak if I need to? I know the SCC is good. Farber feels too quiet to talk in, but maybe Goldfarb is okay? I've also spent time in random, empty Mandel classrooms, but I'm kind of terrified someone is going to walk in for a class and get upset with me for using the room like that. I've been in Shapiro Science Center, but only to study, never during a Zoom class.\n\n\\-second semester first-year :))))",

Also as a student of the University (member of the community as Jamele would say) you are allowed to use them so don't feel ashamed about it. If someone needs the room, they'll just ask you politely to leave. If they get mad they are being irrational and contrary to university goals of inclusion and community, you definitely will not get in trouble for trying to find a quiet place to study.\n2. Common rooms are pretty good for Zoom too, idk i just do mine all in my room but I see how important it can be to have a separate study place.",

As for other options I\u2019ve heard scc and farber are good but can\u2019t speak from experience, only from what others have told me. If your building has a common area, which most if not all do, go there, they\u2019re perfect for classes!",

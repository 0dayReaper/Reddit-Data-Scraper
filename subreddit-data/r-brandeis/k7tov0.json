    "postText": "Previously, I was under the assumptions, from students at Brandeis and other data websites, that Brandeis didn't give much financial aid and that the schools wasn't very affordable. However, I looked at Financial Aid Info Guide just to see what it was and it said: \n\n&gt;\" Brandeis University meets the full calculated financial need of its students with a combination of need-based grant, loan and work awards. To meet this need, no more than $19,000 in federal subsidized loans will be awarded to a student over their four-year career, which is far below the national average upon graduation. \"\n\nI would take the statement to mean that they now meet 100% of demonstrated need and that there average loan debt (from the school loans themselves, not private loans) is $19,000, but that is such a drastic change from the last time I saw stats so I was wondering if I am misinterpreting something.",

            "comment": "The thing is, they will probably meet what they say, but keep in mind that they can manipulate the percentages however they want. For example, let\u2019s just say you received FA of $45,000 per year. You might be pretty stoked, but this is what your actual detailed package may look like:\n\n$10,000 - Grant\n$6,000 - Pell grant (Your fafsa aid)\n$25,000 - Loans\n$4,000 - Work study\n\nSee what I did here? You may be receiving $45,000 of FA, but your grant is only $16,000 combined. Basically wjat this means is you\u2019re either gonna 1. Work to pay off tuition (work study) or 2. Pay them back later (loans). This means you\u2019re technically still paying for that portion of the tuition, eventually.\n\nI personally had a great experience w the finaid dept. at Brandeis. However, there is probably a lot of people that didn\u2019t have a good exchange with them. So just be aware of what I explained to you above because that financial package would absolutely meet your needs in their eyes.",

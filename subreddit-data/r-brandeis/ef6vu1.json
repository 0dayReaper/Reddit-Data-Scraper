He flies out tomorrow evening. \nHe was notified by email that the package was delivered and when he went to pick it up everything was locked and no one is answering any of the phone numbers or email addresses listed on the website. \nI understand it's Christmas Eve, but there must be someone to contact or some way for him to retrieve his mail.\n\nAppreciate any help.",

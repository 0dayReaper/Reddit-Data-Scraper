While I loved every moment of my Brandeis experience and truly wouldn't be the person I am today without it, I would not have gone into the $50K, $80K, even $100K+ worth of debt that my friends did. That's true of any school, not just Brandeis, but Brandeis is overwhelmingly expensive both as a university and in the COL in the Boston area.\n\nWhat do you plan on studying? It's hard to give you more info without knowing anything else.\n\n",

Hopefully I'd be studying either creative writing or general biology, at this point, but possibly narrowing the latter down as I learn more about the majors. Thanks for all the information!",

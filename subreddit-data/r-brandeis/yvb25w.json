Junior year is usually the best year to take NBIO 140 (the core course). Best elective was NBIO 146 but save that for later years in my opinion. BIOL 42 and PSYC 10a aren\u2019t neuro-specific but still give you a good feel for the field overall.",

There\u2019s no required homework, and if you take good notes, you don\u2019t really have to do any of the readings. The whole grade for the course is composed of 3 sets of 3 quizzes, and he drops the lowest quiz from each set.",

Feel free to PM me with any other questions (about Chem or otherwise), but the program is pretty good, there's lots of opportunities for undergraduate research, most of the professors are alright, here's some of my advice:\n\n- Take Honors General Chemistry (15) not Chem 11. It's less busy work, more theoretical, and a much better background in Chemistry. \n\n- If you have AP Physics C credit from high school, USE IT! Physics here is a pain in the ass.\n\n- Try and join a research lab as soon as you can, I wish I had during freshman year. Lots of the bio/orgo oriented ones fill up a lot faster than the physical or inorganic labs, so if that's you're background you probably will have better luck\n\nOverall I'd say the Chem program here is pretty good, I've been happy with the quality of the professors, Mascall for Orgo is great! \n",

    "postText": "Hey everyone! I applied ED to Brandeis but got deferred to the regular decision pool. Does anyone know how common this is for Brandeis? I know for some schools it's uncommon but for others it's the nice way of rejecting their ED applicants. For anyone that got deferred and eventually accepted, how did you go about it - did you email them, etc?\n\nI'm planning on majoring in physics and creative writing :) I think I got deferred because I got a D in physics and they want to see me raise my grades? I have A's and B's in every other class though.",

However, no university (Brandeis included) has anything to gain by stringing you along into the RD round if they were committed to rejecting you.  \n\n\nI don't think you have to \\*do\\* anything else (your ED application is already an indication of what your 1st choice is).  Best of luck to you!  \n\n\n\\-- Brandeis '84",

You  update the school on what you\u2019ve done or have been doing since the applications and restate why you\u2019re interested in attending, and how you\u2019d contribute back into the school\u2019s community.

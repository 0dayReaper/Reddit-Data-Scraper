    "postText": "I'm going in undecided (sort of considering Finance but really I have no idea) so it would be great to talk to a student who also was undecided and went down a similar path. However my main focus right now is on the culture of the school and how I'll fit in. Both my parents went to Brandeis if that's of any use. \n\nHobbies: I've been doing 3D design for years now, albeit less frequently lately in favor of guitar. I did a bunch of work for Get to the Orange Door over the summer which was really fun. Overall I'm pretty artistic. I'm also into music, and I play guitar\u2013alt/funk/etc. rock. Being able to participate in music by joining a band/playing with others is a definitely a priority for me. I got into some casual investing this past year (just basic research and self education, and holding/trading ETFs). I also love to fence and was captain of my school's team for about 2 seconds before Covid. I'm not a stoner but I think I would fit in to casual (as opposed to burnout) stoner culture in college. I also like to hike a bit, and I'm accompanying a friend of mine on the first few weeks of the Appalachian this summer. \n\nAcademically I was involved in the school newspaper for 3 years. Otherwise, I'm a consistently strong student, 4.05 and a 33 ACT. Generally the humanities come easier, though. \n\nSo let me know if you're available or know anyone involved in similar hobbies/interests with whom you could put me in touch. Comments or DMs are cool! I'm hoping to pay around $40-50 but let me know what works. Thanks in advance!\n\nBen",

    "postText": "People who have taken General Biology lab (BIOL 18B) before, how long does it usually take to complete the lab during lab sessions? I am considering taking Biostatistics in the same semester, but it starts right as biology lab ends. If bio lab is anything like gen chem lab (ends early if you finish lab early), I'm thinking maybe I could get away with taking both courses, but I don't want to push it.",

Most days will take the full amount of time, though that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll be working nonstop (lots of experiments have waiting times built in). I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be time to budget both courses, unfortunately.",

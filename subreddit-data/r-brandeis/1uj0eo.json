They don't babysit and they don't dick around. If you want to get straight As, go to Harvard.  The attrition rate in the premed track is very high, but those who do make it through go on to get into med school without too much trouble. Of my group of friends I have not heard of a single one not getting in. You will be well prepared for your studies, just realize that your social life will begin and end in the classroom if you're serious about doing better than just getting by. Most of the professors are very caring and devoted people, if not always the best of instructors, and will often bend over backwards to help students in need out. I felt like they wanted all their pupils to succeed and that they relish their interactions with students. The student body is awesome, the campus very homey, food services rapidly improving and the dorms comfortable. The only negative is that the administration is a bloated arrogant money sucking machine. They'll eat most of your tuition by padding the salaries of those at the top. \n\nTl;dr \n1. Great science programs\n2. Wonderful people \n3. High probability of med school acceptance if you make it through \n4. Expect to work very hard \n5. Premed not advised for those needing to party a lot. ",

I'm not a big person on partying. Although I wouldn't mind being trampled with hours of studying, when it comes down to a social life, I really only care about how much **free time** I would have for clubs, hanging out with friends here and there, and joining campus activities every once in a while. I don't mind working hard and long, but I can only work so hard and so long before I completely wear myself down.. haha. Regardless, I am glad to hear that the community in Brandeis is so caring and connected - that mainly was what prompted my application to Brandeis in the first place! And thank you for giving me a breakdown of the school!",

It's hard to tell how the academic experience in Brandeis would be like... given that our perception of \"rigorous\" is different. I've been a fairly good student in my years of high school and I hope that my work ethic would translate somewhat smoothly to college. \n\nIn any regard, I'm actually very curious about the EMS service in Brandeis. It looks like an awesome opportunity to meet some great people and help others along the way. Can you tell me how it works? And possibly how I can sign up during my freshman year? (I know that I haven't been accepted to Brandeis yet, but I'm *curious* about the program!)",

You probably have not had a chance to adapt to the level of independence in your activities that you'll be afforded, and it can take a while to get used to being able to do what you want when you want. With that in mind, if you are disciplined in your studies and good at time management, you should come out just fine. BEMCo (that's the services name) is great for people who want to learn and gain some experience. That said, in my time there it was very cliquey and you were either in or out. They do offer a class (which I used to assistant teach/coordinate) every spring semester on campus. It's a semester long, maybe 10 hours a week (or at least it was when I took it) and will cost $800 to $1200. With that in mind, BEMCo is one of the nation's leading on campus services, and does far more than any other service we knew of while I was in. My experience there was soured by the politics, but it does provide a tremendous opportunity for those interested and ambitious. ",

As mentioned by another Brandeis student, Brandeis seems to a place of political conflict.. I tend to go the opposite direction of politics simply because it can get very ugly- thus signifying why I don't usually deal with politics. ",

I meant it as \"any time you put 2+ people in a room, there's gonna be drama\". \n\nBEMCo had a ton of \"I have no problem solving skills and am a recently minted adult, my parents told me I was the greatest thing ever, and therefore all these problems that you say I created were in fact you, so go away.\" It also had a very strong in group-out group such that if you were not magically accepted into the in-group by the previous year's in-group, you would not get promoted beyond a certain point, and you would get fewer shifts than those in the in. \n\nI'll put it this way, it operates like the real world, and you'll learn a lot about dealing with petty issues like ego, drama, and exclusion in a semi professional environment. I'd say it's a great job/social skill builder, because at the end of the day, you're not getting paid to do it, you don't make your living on it, and there are always \"real\" EMTs from a private company available to take over.

            "comment": "I'm a 2010 grad who didn't spend all too much time in the sciences (I was the person whose face lit up during a tour when told I could take economics in place of a math), but have quite a few friends from college in med school now. While the classes are tough, it's still possible to have a social life. I was very involved in political stuff in college, from phone banking and knocking on doors to long, late night conversations about election procedure and there were science majors among us. But there also wasn't pressure to be involved in the political discussions.\n\nThe average Brandeisian, no matter what their major, tends to be underrested, overcaffeinated, and overscheduled. For instance, I was the slouch among my friends and I was a double major/double minor (close to a triple major, double minor but I did it in 3 1/2 years so..), studied abroad in 3 different countries, held leadership roles in two clubs and the student union, was involved in a handful of other clubs, and did all of this while either working or interning part time. It's do-able if you enjoy it, but you just won't get much sleep for a few years! \n\nYou also see funky awesome things at Brandeis, like people who are on the pre-med track but had a double major in Latin American studies and anthropology (and yes, she's in med school now!). I had an acquaintance who double majored in theater and neuroscience, and it was a bit of surprise when he decided to pursue a PhD in the latter rather than continue his success on stage professionally. \n\nIn the years since graduating, I've had some medical challenges and spent quite a bit of time in some of the most prestigious hospitals in the country and run into quite a few Brandeis undergrad alumni. Many of them had earned their MD or nursing degrees from such prestigious institutions as Harvard Med with internships and careers at MGH, Dana-Farber, Brigham and Women's, Sloan-Kettering, etc. Maybe it's a little Brandeisian bias, but my Brandeis medical professionals are not only fantastic doctors and nurses, but they also have phenomenal bedside manner.",

Perhaps I'll have more options other than Brandeis (Taken that I get in); I applied to Tufts and Boston College as well... If I happen to get in Brandeis, I'm pretty sure a visit to the university would give me a clearer picture. I am sorry that you aren't enjoying your experience at Brandeis. It must be terrible to be trapped in a place that you dislike. ",

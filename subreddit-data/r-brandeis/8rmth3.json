    "postText": "Hi guys! I'm not from the area but am subletting a place really close to Brandeis University this summer (along Moody Street). Is there any facilities or summer happenings at Brandeis that a non-local person should know about?\n\nAlso any advice on gyms or parks in the area for simple lifting/cardio? I looked at Brandeis's rec center but it's not open to the public :( ",

            "comment": "Brandeis is generally pretty dead over the summer while students are gone. Any thing going on would generally be on the [event cal](http://www.brandeis.edu/events/) , but as stated previously there isn't much. If you have an eduroam password you can hang out it the SSC or library and browse on the fast internet, but that is about it. Really though if you are looking for interesting things I just recommend taking the commuter rail (or Uber) into Boston. \n\nAlso regarding the rec center, security at the front desk is often very lax and you often can walk in without anyone stopping you (particularly if you look like a college student). Did this a many times when I forgot my card (and was rarely stopped). ",

Never saw rats myself but I know they exist because of an incident last year, but mint should repel them as well. (edit: I forgot a few people had wasps but they are also repelled by the magic of mint pest control)\n\nThe bathrooms were clean though! Only issue was people leaving hair in the drains but thats a problem everywhere. Honestly the dorms were fairly okay.",

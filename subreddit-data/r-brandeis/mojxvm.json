    "postText": "Hi! I was recently admitted to Brandeis (HSSP major on pre-med track) and I really like it because its research university and a liberal arts school so best of both worlds but I have a couple concerns regarding social life and commuting to Boston so if a current Brandeisian could answer that would be awesome!\n\nSo for social life- I've heard thats its really cliquey and that people aren't the most outgoing so I was just wondering if people at Brandeis know how to and want to have a good time. Like even I'm not a party animal but I still want to be able to go out during the weekends and hang out with friends so how is Brandeis for that? Also how close-knit is the community?\n\nCommuting to Boston- as a pre-med student, a lot of the opportunities like hospitals, shadowing, internships will probably be in Boston (I did read a post earlier that said that the Childrens Hospital in waltham is very close by). Even beyond academics, I would still want to go to Boston every now and then for fun since I have heard there is not much to do in Waltham, so how easy is it to commute to Boston especially for things that have specific times like volunteering. \n\nAlso someone told me that the science classes are scaled so is this a good or bad thing in other people's experiences? Like does that make it hard to get an A?\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

            "comment": "You seem to have a pretty accurate picture of Brandeis. You really do get the best of both worlds in terms of a research University and a liberal arts college. Honestly, best way to get to Boston/Cambridge is to drive or Uber. Its like a $25-35$ 10-15 min uber into Boston. There is also a free shuttle that runs Thursday through Sunday. It take you to Cambridge in like 20 min, but it takes like 45 min to Boston via the shuttle. You can also uber to the train station in Newton and take the T which might save a little money compared to ubering directly to Boston. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSocial scene: I love it here because I've made amazing friends through Greek life. However, freshman year was kind of rough for me socially. Compared to most colleges people do not party much. Personally, I get drunk and have a great time every weekend, but most frat parties are closed events, meaning invite only. During non-coivd times there will be at least one open party about every other weekend. Sports teams also have houses and throw down, but you need to be an Athlete or a girl who is friends with athletes to go to those. If you are 21 or get a really good fake, bars/clubs in Boston are a lot of fun I hear, though my experience is limited due to coivd.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot a science major so I can't answer your last question, but I can tell you that my premed friends work their asses off in gen chem, orgo, and biochem.",

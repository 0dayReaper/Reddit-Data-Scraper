    "postText": " Is Brandies University Film, Television and Interactive Media Program good for filmmaking? I am an international student and am looking for film production programs in Massachusetts, esp waltham. Others Im looking into (found through countless google searches) are Fisher College, Lesley University and Bentley University (Media and Culture major) though that one seems a little too business focused for my liking. Anyone have any experience with these universities (or others) and can help me? I have applied in other better schools too like Rutgers, Seton Hall University, UNT, UMiami etc but looking to keep my options open in Bosoton as well. '",

            "comment": "Go to Emerson if you want to focus on film production in a pre-professional program. Brandeis is a liberal arts university and you will take lots of courses in areas like literature, writing, history, politics, sociology, anthropology. You will also have opportunities to study abroad. But the film program has limited production facilities. \n\nBentley is a business school. Don\u2019t know much about Lesley\u2019s film major but it\u2019s also liberal arts (more arts courses than Brandeis maybe as they merged with an art college a while back). Fisher is known as a junior college \u2014 not top tier at all like the others.",

I personally love Emerson but according to commonapp it requires you to choose your major and concentration while applying, and you can't change it later. Im not sure what concentration I want to do so I feel like going to Emerson would restrict me. I looked into Fisher Colleges rankings etc and definitely off my list now. But the debate between Bentley Media and Culture, and Brandeis course is still on my mind.",

Since you\u2019re international you might not be familiar with business colleges like Bentley. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad school at all. Just a different mentality and personality from Brandeis. Maybe you can take a video tour or talk to some students. Good luck!",

Can\u2019t speak for a Bentley directly but Brandeis has a large international student population with lots of supports for them. Though you would have to take classes not directly related to film since it\u2019s liberal arts (there are general requirements\u2014you\u2019ll need science, math, etc. and a broader range within your major too).",

Idk I'm not exactly sure which one is more suited that's why Im looking for alumni or anyone with insight. Here are the two programs\n\nhttps://catalog.bentley.edu/undergraduate/programs/arts-sciences-programs/ba-degree-programs/media-culture-major/?_ga=2.154894140.587513569.1671445578-1138875780.1671445578\n\nhttps://www.brandeis.edu/film/undergraduate/index.html",

It really depends on your financial situation and whether you are international, etc. If you have to pay full price (their merit-only aid is pretty competitive), it\u2019s a lot. Here\u2019s the cost of attendance: https://www.bu.edu/finaid/aid-basics/cost-of-attendance/undergraduate/ \n\nOur calculus was that if my daughter doesn\u2019t have to go to graduate film school (she\u2019s getting a lot of hands-on experience at BU), at least right away, that\u2019s a cost savings of $200k in graduate school tuition (Columbia Film School). You also might want to run the net price calculator for BU. https://www.bu.edu/finaid/aid-basics/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator/",

Maybe there's a school I've missed because BU is probably going to be too pricey for me. I'm a US citizen by birth so I do get FAFSA aid but like you said, merit scholarships are competitive. Unfortunately, I just can't seem to find a substitute university in the area but I don't want to apply to BU or Emerson",

Some other film programs close to Mass are at Wesleyan (Middletown, CT), Connecticut College (New London, CT\u2014amazing school) and Sarah Lawrence (Bronxville, NY). You could also check out Fordham in the Bronx. Great school and from what I could tell, strong film/TV program. Don\u2019t be put off by the Bronx\u2014the campus looks like Georgetown and is across from the Botanical Gardens and Zoo. Quick subway ride or \u201cRam Van\u201d to Manhattan. Fordham also has a Lincoln Center campus.",

The great thing about the program is that they have an on-campus long running soap opera that is exclusively student-run. You get IMDB credit if you work on it and they need lots of people. They also have a cool club where you get to make short films. Many other opportunities that are open to everyone.",

    "postText": "(Posting on my friends behalf)\n\nHi,\nI got the offer for the MS-BA program with a dean\u2019s scholarship (~50k). It\u2019s still not enough to cover the entire degree fee ~75k.\n\nI am an international student and want to ask is this possible to get the GTA/GRA in first semester if I reach out to professors/department. \n\nWhat are my options with the on-campus job? And how can I reach out to the people looking to hire on campus? \n\nDoes the GTA/GRA comes with stipend and/or fee wavier? \n\nHow is the living expense out-of-campus? \n\nI would really appreciate your input in this matter or kindly connect with someone in the similar situation. Thank you.",

If you don\u2019t have a work study you\u2019ll still be eligible to apply but you won\u2019t get initial preference. Rent in Waltham is about $1700-2200 a month so it\u2019s pretty expensive to live on campus but if you have some roommates it\u2019s definitely possible! congratulations!!",

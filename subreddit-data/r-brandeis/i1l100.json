Do any current students in the program have any wisdom on it?\n\nThe emails made it seem very \u201cexclusive\u201d (for lack of a better word). I was just wondering if it\u2019s difficult to get into? If the acceptance rate is low? Or if you just fill out the application decently on time you get in?\n\nThanks!",

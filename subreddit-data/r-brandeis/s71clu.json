Does it reflect the general consensus from the students? https://brandeishoot.com/2020/02/07/open-letter-brandeis-is-failing-its-disabled-students/",

Every midterm and final allots students with special circumstances extra time and can test off site. It\u2019s not a perfect fit, but it\u2019s better than many other schools. \n\nThat letter is so self pittying and accusatory I seriously couldn\u2019t even finish it.",

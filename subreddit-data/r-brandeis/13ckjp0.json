    "postText": "Hey, I'm incoming freshman and want to major in physics. I'm looking through degree requirements, and I have a question about PHYS 11a,b vs PHYS 15a,b. Which would you recommend? I also wanna try and graduate early (I have my reasons), so is it possible to do so, and if yes, which route would you recommend? I'm interested in courses connected to astrophysics and quantum. \nThank you in advance and hope to see you on campus soon :]",

            "comment": "The physics degree is one of the longer degrees at Brandeis with, I think about 17 required courses so it might be hard to graduate early. If that is something that you are really trying to do, then I would recommend skipping right into PHYS 20: waves and oscillations this would require self studying basic mechanics and E&amp;M depending on if you took both AP Physics C E&amp;M and Mechanics. Doing this is somewhat uncommon but is possible and there is usually one or two students who do this per year.\n\nIf you don't have the required background, I recommend any physics major to atleast attempt to do PHYS 15 and if it is too challenging just drop to PHYS 11.",

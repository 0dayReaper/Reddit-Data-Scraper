    "postText": "I am part of the Class of 2027, and based on everything I've heard from students who either love or hate it here, it seems like Brandeis is your typical LAC in terms of college experiences. Would you guys agree with this?\n\nFor example, it has a small class size and student population, and not a lot of crazy party scenes going on, but there is Greek life on campus if you want to look for parties. And the overall student population are academic focused, artsy, indie type of vibe lol? Iykyk. \n\nI guess I'm just afraid that Brandeis might not be the best match for me. But if it offers a similar college experience to a typical LAC, then I think I would be happy with it!",

    "postText": "does anyone have experience with the new robotics gps ms program? [program](https://www.brandeis.edu/gps/future-students/learn-about-our-programs/robotic-software-engineering.html)\n\nIt seems very good, courses seem relevant, scheduling-wise it's good. But i'm not sure what a new program like that would be like or how the professors are.\n\ndoes anyone have any experience here? how to employers in the field see this program?",

In fact, they're currently hiring for 4 teaching positions in the program: https://www.brandeis.edu/gps/community/teach-for-GPS.html\n\nIn general, when you see something offered online, at night, or with monikers like \"professional/continuing studies\" or \"extension\", it means that it's quite separate from the rest of the university.  Likewise, looking at \"Meet our featured faculty\" on the page you linked, you can click their names and see that their title is \"Instructor in the Rabb School of Continuing Studies, Division of Graduate Professional Studies\".\n\nThat doesn't mean that it can't be a good program.  Sometimes instructors are better than professors.  But you won't be learning from Brandeis professors.  You'll be learning from people who work in the industry.  They might be excellent.  It might be a lot more practical than what you'd get from the CS department.  It might give you great access to industry jobs that you'll love.  None of this is meant to dissuade you from applying.  It's just meant to note what the program is.\n\nLots of schools do this.  Brown offers an Executive Master's in Cybersecurity.  Berkeley offers an MS in Data Science and clicking through all their faculty you can see that their titles are \"Lecturer\" or \"Instructor\".  Again, these programs might be excellent, but they're quite apart from the rest of the school.",

Start internship searching early.  Hiatt has a yearly recruitment fair, although lately it has been lacking. \n\nGet projects in your resume, extracurricular like research or TAing (easy to get involved in within COSI).  Don\u2019t skip out on more theory / conceptual classes, especially algo ones like data structures - you\u2019ll need those for interviews.",

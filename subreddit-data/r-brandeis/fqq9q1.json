    "postText": "- he was born in Costa Rica\n\n- he ate a diet of exclusively peanuts and soda water\n\n- his real name was Jackson Martinez. Neat!\n\n- he had 16 pet dogs, all named Gumbo!\n\n- his favorite TV show was \u201cHappy Days\u201d\n\n- he discovered Waltham in 1911 and built the statue we now see near the SCC in order to claim the land for himself. What a go-getter! \n\n- Today, Louis lives in Mashpee, Massachusetts with his 25-year-old wife and works as a freelance actor for commercials on public access TV. Livin\u2019 it up, Louis!",

I\u2019m just trying to positively contribute to this subreddit with interesting facts, and you\u2019re out here being negative. Just sad, really. Pathetic, even. \n\nYou gotta stoop real low to insult me, GOOGAGAMOOGA! You\u2019ve absolutely no respect for da Gamoogz (me) and for that, I must label you an enemy. A dastardly foe. Perhaps, dare I say, a nemesis. Yeah, I like that. Heh. It\u2019s personnel now, kid. \n\nYou me and me, muchacho? We\u2019re at odds; and you best try real hard to make it even, or we got what they call a \u201cgrande problemo\u201d on our hands.",

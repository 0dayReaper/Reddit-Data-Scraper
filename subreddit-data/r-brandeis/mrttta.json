    "postText": "So I got admitted to a Neuroscience MS program at Brandeis and a Biology MS program at Rutgers-N. I have not heard back from the CDB program at Rutgers-NB yet, but still take it into my consideration just in case.\n\nSome information about me: senior international undergraduate student; currently in California; do not own a car; interested in studying neurological diseases at a cellular and molecular level; aim to pursue a PhD after getting a Master's degree, so I need some really good research experience.\n\nI learned that many profs at both of the Rutgers study molecular and cellular neuroscience and many of their research interests match with mine. The research environment sounds really nice as I see the faculty are actively publishing research papers. I also talked with a few professors there and they seem to be very friendly. However, I am worried about the safety in nearby areas. I found lots of people mentioned that there were lots of crimes near both Rutgers and they were equally dangerous places.\n\nFor Brandeis, I really like the location and it looks really safe according to what I found online. I love the fact that there are many other top universities (Harvard, MIT, ect.) around, tho I'm not sure if that would bring any benefits. I also love that it is next to a big city (Boston). However, the research environment seems to be weaker. I feel like they mainly focus on cognitive or system neuroscience. The research focus of the faculty does not seem to match with mine and they generally do not have many publications.\n\nPlease share your experience in choosing grad schools and tell how I should weigh safety vs. other concerns. Any advice or comments will be helpful. Thanks in advance!",

Brandeis\u2019 graduate neuro program is head and shoulders above that at Rutgers and there really isn\u2019t a comparison. It\u2019s a near-Ivy equivalent at absolute worst- the faculty is absolutely world class and is comparable to very few institutions anywhere. Go to school where your research interests will be fulfilled- but know that Brandeis is a head above those other programs.",

            "comment": "You think *we* have a weaker neuro program than *New Jersey*? My friend, we have some top-notch neuro faculty doing plenty of molecular and cellular work. One of our molecular neuroscientists even won a Nobel Prize a few years ago. The Chronicle of Higher Education ranked the neuro program [#2 in the country ](https://www.chronicle.com/article/doctoral-programs-by-the-numbers-124747/). It\u2019s top-notch here, my friend.\n\nIf you want to do a PhD, networking can help. You\u2019ll be down the street from three top-ten neuro programs, all while working in a fourth. Profs of all stripes visit Brandeis, often because it\u2019s an easy leg to add to the trip when you\u2019re visiting Harvard and MIT. You\u2019ll be amazed who you meet. And if course, there is no better place for a twenty-something to live than Boston.",

Disclaimer, my main exposure was to the Biochemistry department but it was a very common thing to have labs or post-docs collaborate with MIT or Harvard researchers or labs. The Boston network for research is so expansive and Brandeis is very encouraging of collaborative research",

I applied early January and an waiting on that decision. I have also been accepted to other programs but Brandeis was my top choice. I have emailed and not heard back yet. I am hoping it\u2019s not a bad sign, but also see on Grad Cafe that it doesn\u2019t seem anyone who applied had heard yet. Do you have any inside info about that program?",

The other program I am considering is a larger research school also but Brandeis has PhD offerings also and you can apply there too, right?",

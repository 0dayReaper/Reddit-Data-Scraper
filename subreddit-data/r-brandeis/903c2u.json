                            "comment": "Well the graduate schools are on different places on campus, which can affect where one might like to live. \n\nBut the short answer is, most students live in Waltham, in the area surrounding campus. \n\nBrandeis is located in a fairly sleepy neighborhood, but is also not far from the Waltham town center (~2 miles), or the Boston/Cambridge area (~10 miles). \n\nThe preferred method of transportation for each of these locations respectively, are walking, taking the Brandeis- specific chartered transportation in the morning, or taking public transportation (the Fitchburg line of the commuter rail runs ~12 times per day). \n\nSo the essential trade off one makes is living closer to campus, with more frequent transportation access) versus living in a more (subjectively) fun area.\n\nDowntown Waltham has a bunch of restaurants and bars that students frequent, and is where the majority of the graduate student parties were held (in my experience).  Rent here ranges from ~$1500+ for a one bedroom, to ~850+ per person in a shared accomodation. \n\nThe commuter rail runs from North Station in Boston, near the North End, a classic Boston neighborhood with narrow streets of townhouses, and an incredible array of restaurants, especially Italian food. This is a very pricey neighborhood ($2500+ to live alone, ~1400 to split a 2/3 bedroom with roommates)\n\nThe next stop on the commuter rail, Porter Square is a vibrant neighborhood in Cambridge, more of a town than the city of Boston. It's got a T-statiom (the public transportation which gets the immediately surrounding areas into Boston) which is nice if going into Boston regularly is something you'd like to be able to do. Prices here would be around $2000+ for a one bedroom, and ~$900+ for a shared apartment. \n\n\ntldr; **Most graduate students live in Waltham, either walking distance from the school or in the downtown area, which is slightly more expensive, but also more fun. Second-year grad students, students who are willing to pay more, to live in a more fun area, often choose to live in Boston or Cambridge.**\n\nPS: owning a car changes the trade-offs listed here. It makes choosing a place near Brandeis/public transportation less necessary. \n\nPPS: look at Facebook/email groups for incoming students. It's easier to find a place to live jointly with other people you are ok living with. \n\n",

Also, as far as renting in Waltham goes, what would your renting recommendation be for someone out of state? Signing a lease without seeing the place is risky but it is also risky to come and stay at a hotel/airbnb without a place finalized.",

            "comment": "I can speak to business/Econ fairly in depth. Rising senior from Florida, and I personally would have rather I\u2019d gone to UF. It\u2019s a big decision, but I\u2019d say that our alumni have placed in the big banks rather poorly as we are a non-target school with low name recognition. The benefit we see is in the Boston area and that alone for the most part. It\u2019s possible to place in BB banks (Goldman Sachs, Merrill, etc) from Brandeis, but it\u2019s a major grind, and the N.Y. offices are unlikely. I don\u2019t know what you want to do or how you plan to do it, but I will say that Brandeis certainly has incredible professors that are brilliant that are always willing and able to sit down with you for a cup of coffee. You probably won\u2019t get that at UF considering it\u2019s so large. I would say weigh the options of what a degree from a quality, small, overly-expensive, liberal arts school with little name recognition means in comparison to a big, athletic, fun school in a poor location. Similar to Brandeis, I can\u2019t imagine UF places well in NY. \n\nBrandeis is rather weird school with a lot of a weird people, and you\u2019ll either love it or you\u2019ll hate it. I don\u2019t know how much FAFSA or scholarship your are getting, but I hope it\u2019s enough to consider the school. Brandeis offers the BA/MA program in Econ where you do a fifth year and obtain your masters. Upon acceptance, everyone is welcome to join the program. Good luck buddy, I was also deciding between UF and Brandeis, and I came for one reason, and I stayed for another. \n\nCS is pretty rough from my understanding, Brandeis offers the BA and the BS with the two requiring a different course load. Hopefully someone can bring more insight. \n\nIf you have any questions feel free to pm me or lmk",

I have a lot of friends that went to UF and had a much higher quality of life. The weather, the lack of life, and overall experience just hasn\u2019t been enjoyable; however, I know I stayed for the right reasons. I\u2019ve landed a good job, with a good mentor, and quality friend circle. \n\nVery few of my business/Econ friends have any idea what they are going to do in the future and have no internship experience despite good grades. The career center is abysmal and it takes a lot of work to overcome the adversity of a low name recognition school in such a saturated field. It is what you make out of it, and if you want to get into finance/CS you\u2019re going to have to work your ass of and prove yourself time and time again.",

            "comment": "I believe the other poster is pretty correct. I was an undergrad who am taking classes at the business graduate school rn, they\u2019re both pretty good in my experience. Graduate career center is pretty good, five year program in Econ adds a lot of value I think but you probably cant do that and double major. CS department is much worse than econ in terms of professors. CS professors just care less, mess up more often, and don\u2019t teach as well in my experience and I think the school rankings bear that out. Antonella is like the best CS professor and she wouldn\u2019t be that highly ranked in Econ.",

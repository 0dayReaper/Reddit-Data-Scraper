    "postText": "Hello! I\u2019m an incoming graduate student. What are the chances that Brandeis will go fully online in Fall 2020?\n\nEven if we successfully flattened the curve over the summer, resurgences are always possible, and schools are such mass gatherings. \n\nI know most students and professors would much prefer in-person classes, and I feel the same way as well, but there are also pros of online classes in my case, mainly because I can save myself a lot of money if I stay with my family in my hometown. \n\nMy biggest fear is that Brandeis will not have a definite answer until they have to, and people can\u2019t plan things accordingly.",

We are charging people full tuition despite the fact that we have a lot of rich donors. They said \u201cIf these donors were to suspect that their gifts were being siphoned off to benefit other parts of the university, as some members of the UO community have suggested, donors would likely reduce their support resulting in insolvency for the program.\" It\u2019s pretty gross.",

I'm going into my last year and kind of disgusted by how much are all these private schools charge.\n\n I for one suspect that they will be charging full price for tuition even if it is online.",

    "postText": "Hello so I was recently admitted to Brandeis and it is in my top two schools between Brandeis and URochester. Now Brandeis did give me more money so I am likely leaning toward attending. However one question I had was about the social/party life and that even if that vibe is not as large on campus how accessible are things like parties and such on the weekends either in the city or part of Brandeis.",

            "comment": "I went to Brandeis for a year and grew up in Rochester and took a couple of classes at U of R. In my experience, Brandeis students tend to be very noticeably more awkward and quirky than average. It can be quite annoying when so many people have no concept of social skills. For me, I wanted to improve my social skills, so I'm glad I transferred out and went somewhere else.\n\nAlso, Brandeis is extremely cliquey. Lots of people only hang out with their group of people similar to them. It felt like high school. This absolutely isn't the norm at other colleges (or at least at the school I transferred to). I found that extremely stifling and depressing.  In my opinion, Rochester is much, much better socially than Brandeis.\n\nBut obviously it depends on what you're looking for. Some people thrive socially at Brandeis (and a lot who I think wouldn't at other schools). Of course, there are lots of great people there as well and the freer environment gives people more room to explore and find themselves. It's not like it's all bad. It's a very cool place in some ways.\n\nFor parties, I'm not a party person so I don't know. Of course, Rochester has better on-campus parties, but being near so many other schools at Brandeis is a bonus.",

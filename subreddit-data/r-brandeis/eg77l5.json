    "postText": " I am thinking of applying to the CompLing program. The main reason I am hesitating to apply is that I haven't been able to find much about this program. So I wanted to ask if there is someone here who is currently (or has previously) enrolled? Basically, I'd like to get an idea of how competitive the program is. Also, how rigorous is the coursework? I've heard Boston has a lot of opportunities in terms of internships. But I am worried about how CL students fare against traditional CS (NLP) students while competing for these internships? Lastly, is the program worth the money?\n\nBackground- I am a CS undergrad.",

            "comment": "Boston is probably one of the strongest markets for NLP skills.  Speech recognition was really Boston centric before more players got involved (and even then companies like Apple and Amazon put a lot of their speech in Boston so they could poach talent).\n\nI think the program is really good if you're looking to do NLP.  A lot of people seem to end up at Amazon since they're hiring like crazy.  You'd probably fare better than a just-CS person if you have CS and CL.",

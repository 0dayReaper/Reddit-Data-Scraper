I\u2019ve heard that one sorority even still has a hazing week and has little members of color, who they treat really badly (I\u2019m Asian). What are their reputations etc. Also, do you have to / how much do u need to pay to be in a sorority? Thank you!",

            "comment": "Went to Brandeis, was in a fraternity, close to many sorority girls over 4 years. I'll say: SDT doesn't haze but is a lot of Jewish American Princesses, DPhiE is somewhat diverse but very beaurocratic, doesn't haze, KBG hazes and almost got shut down because of it (they may have since stopped, and the hazing really wasn't too bad even before they got caught) but they are actually quite diverse and even known for having a large asian population, and APP is full of people who are even more social rejects than the rest of Brandeis. If you're looking for a more wholesome sorority experience, go DPhiE, if you're looking for a more wild experience go KBG, if you're rich and want to hate all of your sorority sisters go SDT. That said, join greek life if you want to have more than 6 friends over 4 years, Brandeis is full of socially inept people and there is little to no social scene if you don't have some connection to greek life. \n\nConcerns about no recgnition: you don't get the professor and staff connections you might want, but you still have networks of hundreds of members world wide from your chapter and thousands from the national office. All fraternities and sororities at Brandeis are recognized by a national organization, just not the university because greek life is not \"all inclusive\" I was offered a job out of graduation by someone who graduated before I was born and had never met me because we were in the same fraternity. \n\nHope this helps!",

            "comment": "This popped up on my Reddit feed randomly... but w.e., I'll give you some info from a non-Brandeis perspective.\n\n1 - Lack of school support is a *very bad sign.* Most of the benefits of Greek life come from the networking, and if you're expressly prohibited from networking with staff and faculty (because you can't set up official events on school property), you're losing out on an important aspect.\n\n2 - \"This one sorority has a hazing week\" is probably a lie. I'm guessing it came from someone who isn't in that sorority? Somebody who maybe has an interest in encouring you to rush a different sorority? And anybody in that sorority says \"No, we definitely don't haze.\" Somebody's fudging the truth a little bit here, whether it's on the definition of hazing, or who is doing what. Anyways, some sororities have wild ideas of hazing... even a day long scavenger hunt was banned from one chapter because of \"hazing\"\n\n3 - What do you hope to get out of the sorority? An affordable place to live? Make sure they have a chapter house and that it's not a flophouse, if that's the case. Friends? I mean.... yeah, basically a guarantee that you'll have people around, but, that's a pretty expensive way to make friends.\n\nYou can probably get the same, and more, out of joining other university clubs related to your major and interests. There are a few things that you'll only get from Greek life, but, again, if it's not integrated into the school, they're almost nonexistant.",

I was raised in China (where Greek Life is completely non-existent) so I was curious haha I\u2019m considering going to rush events to socialize but probably not actually rush. Is that like an ok thing to do (I know they say rush week is non-commitment) but is that like actually not THAT ok?",

If you do that, don't mention it, just be ready to hold your line if you're given a bid and say 'no.' Sometimes, the group dynamics will lead to people agreeing even if they don't really want to, and it can be hard to back out after that.\n\nDoes Brandeis have Frosh week? That might be more your thing. Rush week isn't at all like Greek life. Rush is usually the part everybody is looking forward to because it's the series of events that feel the least like a job.",

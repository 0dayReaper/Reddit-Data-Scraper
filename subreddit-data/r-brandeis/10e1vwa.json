If you're going into computational linguistics/machine learning, it's a very good option; if you're going into anything else regarding computer science, it's an extremely weak department. We're experiencing a lot of turnover right now, including 2 of the best professors in the department leaving, so the department's future is looking pretty bleak\u2014not to mention the department is currently understaffed and extremely disorganized. We're getting 2 new professors next semester, so there's really no telling what the future of the department will look like teacher-wise.\n\nHow the program is structured is that you get an overall degree that's a bit of everything. If you specifically want to specialize in something, you can *maybe* take one or even two classes in it (the exception is computational linguistics, which even has its own master's program here), but if you want to specialize in anything else you likely won't be able to unless it's on your own time.\n\nAs a CS major, if you're specifically looking for a university that's strong in computer science, go somewhere else.",

There are a handful of professors who are hit-or-miss, and then a few that are just pretty bad. I wouldn't say there's no hope, because the department is being shuffled around so much, but currently it's still understaffed.",

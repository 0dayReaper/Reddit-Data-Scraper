    "postText": "Hi there! I'm an incoming student to Brandeis, and I am majoring in politics. I'm curious if anybody has information on Professor Renanah Joyce, who would possibly be my professor for POL15a: Introduction to International Relations with Professor Bernard Yack. I have to take either POL10a: Introduction to Political Theory or Joyce's POL15a course to complete my third introductory course required for the major. Prof. Joyce does not have a RateMyProf so I can't find any students opinions on her or the course; it appears people really like Bernard Yack and his class but I am also intrigued by Joyce's class. Any information would be greatly appreciated!",

Ex- why brandies, why my major, the favorite class I\u2019ve taken in high school, etc. To prepare I had my resume printed out as well as typed up answers to some of the common college interview questions so I\u2019d be less nervous. I also had a list of questions for the interviewer. I don\u2019t remember much from my Brandeis interview other than it was very relaxed",

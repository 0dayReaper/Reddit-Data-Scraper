                    "comment": "That system would be impossible to police. Brandeis' only motivation to recognize greek life would be to establish a greek police (and keep their students on campus rather than running around Waltham). In terms of space for frat houses on campus there obviously isn't any. \n\nThere are also many incentives not to recognize greek life on both sides: \nBrandeis doesn't want to be associated with greek life as it could hurt admissions. \nBrandeis cannot afford to lose the money donated to them on the basis of having non-exclusive clubs (making frats non-exclusive would be far too difficult as well). \nFraternities at Brandeis acknowledge that they only have one thing to gain from being recognized: on campus events. Events such as these would add little to the Fraternity rushes as they already occur under the radar. \n\nConclusion: \nNo one really wants it. Controversy is a hoot. (pun-erific ending) \n\nOne thing that does need to happen: Brandeis needs to allow greek life to have philanthropic events on campus. ",

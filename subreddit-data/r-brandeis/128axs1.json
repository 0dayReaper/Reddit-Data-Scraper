    "postText": "i was admitted for co \u201827, 4.0 GPA all through 9-11th grade, then it dropped to 3.99 after getting an A- in AP chem for my first semester senior year. i\u2019m honestly impressed i managed an A- in that class\n\nthing is tho, second semester, AP chem is rlly screwing me over and not only do i think i\u2019m gonna end up with a B, but it\u2019s also affecting my performance in my other courses. if i were to end my senior year with straight B\u2019s (after having been an A student for the most part) would that be enough to rescind my acceptance? what if i get a C?",

Advising Alert just means they\u2019ll reach out to you with more resources, you\u2019re still considered good academic standing. Also if it\u2019s your only C or two i wouldn\u2019t worry about it! \n\nHere is what my letter said: \n\n\u201cI am writing to inform you that your final high school transcript was recently reviewed by the Admissions Committee, and it has been noted that your academic performance since your acceptance has declined significantly in comparison to your previous achievements. Please understand that you were admitted to Brandeis under the expectation that the rigor of your schedule and your academic performance would remain consistent. Because of the decline in your academic performance, you have been placed on advising alert as you enter your first semester at Brandeis.\n \nDuring your time at Brandeis, your academic standing can fall into one of the following categories: Dean\u2019s List (semester GPA at or above 3.5), good standing, advising alert, and academic probation. Advising Alert is considered good academic standing, but serves as an indicator that you are not performing at the academic level expected. Being on advising alert is not meant to overshadow the success you have demonstrated during your time in high school. Rather, this status is meant to connect you with additional resources and support in your transition to Brandeis. As you work this fall to fully return to good standing, we encourage you to take the following actions:\u201d",

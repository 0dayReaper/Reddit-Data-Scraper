    "postText": "I am currently deciding between Marist and Brandeis for a double major in film and studio art. Both are a similar cost so that isn\u2019t a factor. \n\nDoes Brandeis have a more theory based film program? Do they have good internships for film students? \n\nI like the environment at Brandeis and the open curriculum but I feel like Marist may have stronger internships and more funding for the arts. What do you guys think?",

Plus tons of ways to get involved in all sorts of things on campus and in Boston.\n\nAlso, FWIW, I knew a bunch of folks from high school who went to Marist and I don't think most of then would have been able to get into Brandeis. I think going to Brandeis would be a no-brainer.",

    "postText": "Hello, hope you all are well. I am currently bricking it as the decision time comes near. Um, I know it's a little late to yk have a what are my chances type thing but here we go I guess. I have a GPA of 3.7/4 with a class rank of 5 out of 500. Um, my essay is about the rural roots I am honored to have although they caused me trouble when I moved to a city, and its about you know overcoming those fears. My ECs are mostly into journalism writing stuff, and initiatives started to protect minority groups which were eventually recognized by my country's government. I was also on my school's soccer team as well as my student body's president. I have a lot of awards in MUNs, and one of my family members and my father have gone to Brandeis; they have changed my family circumstances and I will always be grateful to them. I am an international student and yeah that's about it if my application is put briefly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUm, do I have a chance. I have no hopes because I am tired of my expectations hurting me. But, um do let me know, and yeah thank you.",

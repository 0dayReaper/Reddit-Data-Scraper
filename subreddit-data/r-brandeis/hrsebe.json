    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm an incoming physics PhD student looking to get some info on the physics qualifying exam. I read online that there are two parts: an oral examination and a written examination which amounts to getting a B or higher in PHYS 161a, 162a,b, and 163a.\n\nI believe I heard from other PhD students you can take an exam as in incoming first year student to see if you place of any/some/all(lol) of these courses. Is this true? And if so, is it recommended? I come from a good undergrad institution (top 5 in US) and think I have a decent background, but I also know it's v important to build a strong base. That's why I'm hesitant to skip any courses. If you poorly, would the faculty know?\n\nMore generally, do you have advice for an incoming physics PhD student? As it relates to prep for quals, success in the times of CoViD, or otherwise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

Maybe there\u2019s a course at MIT or Harvard you want to take or there\u2019s a professor you want to do research/lab work or doing a reading course with. If this is something you are interested in I would contact the professor of the course you want to exempt. Usually they\u2019ll talk to you about why you want to exempt (so have your plan ready!) and schedule a time for you to take a previous exam. If you do poorly you just take the class, its pretty much a free roll.",

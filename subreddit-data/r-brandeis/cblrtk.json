    "postText": "Brandies is on my short list for applying ED. I love what I've heard so far about the school (I'm interested in poli sci/business). I know it's hard to summarize, but anything would help. How competitive/cutthroat? How much partying? What does a typical weekend look like? Are people happy? How good is the alumni network?",

            "comment": "I\u2019m going into my junior year at Brandeis and it\u2019s certainly academically rigorous, but I find it very collaborative. Most people in my classes aren\u2019t competitive and like helping others. In terms of partying, Brandeis is not at all party school. We\u2019re a small school in the suburbs with small parties that seem to end pretty early. However, it\u2019s a very active campus and there are always shows and events happening during the week and weekend. It\u2019s also pretty easy to get into Boston via the commuter rail or the campus shuttle. Waltham is also pretty cute.",

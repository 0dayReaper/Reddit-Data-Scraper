            "comment": "I graduated quite a bit ago, but the Brandeis CS major is very light compared to other schools. So you don't have to worry about knocking requirements out. I'd suggest taking at least the first CS course (unless you can get out of it with prior experience), and use the other slots to get rid of Gen Ed classes. If you want to be advanced you can also take discrete math. Also if you want to double major make sure to take that intro class as well. Feel free to message or comment of you have any other questions.",

Just be careful, a lot of people fall into the trap of thinking because they took N AP classes in high school they can handle a large course load at Brandeis. Do you have previous coding experience?",

I think the department is transitioning in a lot of ways now. Some CS classes are hard no matter what, but I\u2019d say Brandeis has pretty flexible requirements. \n\nYour advisors/Roosevelt fellows can help with scheduling but just look at the requirements and I think you\u2019ll be fine!

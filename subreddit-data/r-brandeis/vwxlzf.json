    "postText": "Hey, so as the title says I haven\u2019t decided what I want to major in at the moment and am having trouble planning out which courses I\u2019d like to take with registration opening in a few days. I have a preference towards science (biology/ecology) but I\u2019d be lying if I said I was exceptionally skilled or invested in those fields, so I want to keep my options open.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m feeling just kind of completely clueless. I\u2019ve read through all the resources which Brandeis has offered relating to course registration and \u201cThe Brandeis Core\u201d, but when I log onto Workday and try to create my academic plan I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by choice and haven\u2019t yet found any resources that outline good introductory courses for people like me (though I\u2019d probably attribute that to my own poor searching skills if anything). As stupid as it makes me feel to admit it, I just don\u2019t have the slightest idea how to pick good courses for me (both in terms of being on my right level, and fulfilling any requirements). \n\nI feel I started to look into this kind of late and for that I\u2019m feeling kind of dumb :(, but if anyone would be able to provide me with some sort of outline /sense of how I should build my schedule for the fall semester (and 2022-23 as a whole) that would be greatly appreciated!!! I\u2019ve been considering contacting my Roosevelt Fellow, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a big ask and wouldn\u2019t want to bother them if they\u2019re dealing with any summer projects or their own preparations.",

            "comment": "I graduated about 10 years ago, so my details are likely out of date, but just in terms of general advice in this situation:   \n\n1. DEFINITELY contact your Roosevelt Fellow. Worst case, they won't respond, or will give you advice that you think is bad. They exist to give advice, don't worry yourself out of taking advantage of that resource.  \n2. Do you have an academic advisor yet? If so, email them! Again, worst case, they won't respond, or will give you advice you think is bad. Low risk, high reward!  \n3. Here's what I would say if I was your Roosevelt Fellow or academic advisor: First, decide how many classes you want to take (probably 5, maybe 6). Second, figure out which courses you *must* take in your first semester/first year. When I was at 'deis for example, we had to do a UWS and another seminar in the first year. Look up all the options for those, and make a list of all the ones you find somewhat interesting. Once you've got that list, you can slowly whittle it down further until you've got two options for each of your required courses (Why two? Just in case you can't get into one of them. I remember class registration being a bit competitive for popular classes. How should you whittle it down? Compare your options. If you had to pick between class A and class B, which would you pick? etc etc until you've got only two left.) Once you've got those figured out, look through the entire course catalogue and make a list of every course that looks interesting to you that you that have no prereqs. Again, whittle that down until you've got a list that is only a few courses longer than the number of slots you have left in the semester. This was a lot easier when I was at 'deis and there was an actual physical catalogue that you could leaf through and circle course descriptions, but I digress.   \n\nThis part may be out of date, but when I was at 'deis, the core requirements were not very difficult to satisfy. Any classes you pick now will get you started on them, and later once you have a better idea of your interests, you can pick specific classes to fill any gaps in core requirements. (Hopefully someone with more recent information can say if this is still true)   \n\nCourse choices will get easier after you spend a semester at school - you'll understand the process better, and you'll also better understand which classes you might find interesting.   \n\nOne last comment - The biology requirements have changed a *lot* since I was there, but at that time, there was at least one class (intro chem + lab) that if you didn't take it first semester, it was difficult to get back on track for the major later. I'd contact the bio UDR (or someone else in the department) to ask if there are any classes you should definitely take 1st semester if you're considering a bio major. If there's an actual ecology major now, I'd ask that department the same questions.   \n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "As a rising junior in the Bio major I would recommend (if you are thinking bio) doing Bio 16 evolution and biodiversity first semester and then Bio 15 second semester. I can only say good things about both of those Professors and the courses seem to line up with your interest in ecology. If you are thinking of majoring in Biology there\u2019s no rush to take gen chem in your first year even if that\u2019s when most people do it, the timeline only gets tight if you are planning on majoring in Chemistry or Biochem. Besides that you need a UWS and then maybe a general university requirement. I regret not fulfilling the language sooner so maybe go for one of those and a humanity class/art class you think you\u2019ll enjoy. \n\nIn Summary take:\nBiol 16\nUWS\nPick 2\n- gen chem with lab\n- humanity university req\n-art university req",

Tbh I didn\u2019t really realize how much freedom I had until you outlined it like this, I\u2019m used to just giving my HS guidance counselor a list of 5 electives I\u2019d like to take and seeing what happens lol\n\nI did take AP Chem, somehow managed to squeak out a 4 but that was a year ago and if I\u2019m being honest with myself don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be strong enough to take the next step just yet. But I heard chem is important regardless of the science you want to take so I think I\u2019ll definitely invest some time in that. \n\nI do have two questions though if that\u2019s ok. If the major I\u2019m interested is a science course, is it ok if I take 3 science courses? Also, would you suggest a new language (maybe German for me) or continuing what I\u2019ve been learning (Spanish)? Thanks again",

If you end up wanting to go to medical school your GPA will be extremely important and 3 science classes might be a bit too much for your first semester, I would do 3 in the second semester if you think you can handle it.\n\nSpecially because you might want to explore fun things that require a lot of time (rushing a sorority, exploring 10 clubs, making tons of friends, partying, etc)\n\nI would highly recommend the honors version of gen chem for you. If you work hard you can get very good grades in them.\n\nFor the language, I think this is a matter of personal preference. Do you like learning languages? Do you want to learn German? Because with German you would need 3 semesters while with Spanish you might be able to skip 1-2 semesters.",

    "postText": "I was looking at Niche reviews, and some of them were saying that Brandeis struggles with faculty support and mental health services. They also said that it\u2019s generally a very cliquey, but anti-social school, as well as a bunch of people talking about transferring. Is any sense of it true? I applied ED1 and I\u2019m trying to take these reviews with a grain of salt, so it would be cool if I could hear anyone\u2019s opinions on the negatives of the school and how true they are.",

            "comment": "I emailed my professor the night before my midterm because I had a mental health issue, and they let me that it a week later without question. Moreover, all my friends are so understanding as well. Most of them have therapists, which is very Brandeis, so they all get it. \n\nAdditionally, I find Brandeis super friendly, and you can easily go up to anyone and start a conversation. And everyone smiles and waves when you pass by them! I think we have a higher percentage of socially awkward, introverted, and people on the spectrum here on campus - but I think that speaks to how friendly everyone is that people that struggle socially have an easier tone here. But yes, if you want a party school, Brandeis isn\u2019t even close.",

                    "comment": "I read something that said everyone is friendly on the surface level, but it\u2019s harder to make actual friends with them, which might just be a result of the common introvertedness. But that was also where I think the cliquey part may come in, but I\u2019m not one to talk since I don\u2019t go there. I\u2019m primarily just worried about making friends and a solid friend group. I also am an introvert, so I\u2019ll see how making friends goes for me (hopefully not terribly). I specifically don\u2019t want a party scene during college which is one of the reasons that Brandeis was great for me, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll struggle too much in that department. As I said earlier it was mainly just the ease of making friends and such.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s definitely good mental health support, but you need to take the initiative to get the support yourself and figure out who to talk to in order to get the accommodations you need. \n\nThe school is 100% cliquey. I\u2019m not sure where the narrative that it isn\u2019t is coming from. This school has nothing unifying the students (weak sports team, no football, no school spirit) so people tend to stick with their friends that they made in clubs. Also the international students are extremely cliquey which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. That being said, everyone is very nice and it is very easy to make friends.\n\nThere are anti-social people here but theres also social butterflies. You wont have trouble making friends. People talk about transferring everywhere because they\u2019re spoiled\n\nThe only strong negative about this school is that the food is extremely disappointing, and its only slightly better in the surrounding area (moody street)",

            "comment": "Cliqueyness is overblown. Brandeis is very much not a party school, so it's definitely antisocial in comparison to some schools but I wouldn't let that scare you off. Just know you're not going to Penn State. Faculty support varies wildly by faculty member and department, but generally you get what you put in. I can attest to the Journalism department being incredibly supportive, I can't speak for other departments though. \n\nIn terms of negatives, I'd say the location is one. I'm a senior, and I am so incredibly done with living in the suburbs. I don't drive tho so that definitely affects it. I did consider transferring briefly because I ended up studying a different field than I expected, so I found myself wanting resources (specifically more media production) that I hadn't expected to earlier.",

I'm a Judaic studies major and so that's a little different than Music Comp but I know a number of music majors and it seems to be a good program. Brandeis itself has many curricular and extracurricular musical opportunities ranging from a cappella to music history. The people here are notoriously friendly and there is also this idea that people here are awkward. Nu. We are not known for partying and the like though parties do happen (there is Greek life but it is not recognized by the university and is off campus). The buildings on campus are a little funny but I think overall it's beautiful nonetheless. I don't know if you happen to be Jewish and keep Kosher but there is an all you can eat Kosher dining hall and though people complain I think realistically the food is very good for college cafeteria food. The best way to find out though is to come visit. ",

However, from talking to alumni, I've learned that Brandeis has less student union funded parties than in the past. Apparently one of them got out of hand a few years ago. But we do have an undercover greek life which isn't allowed to receive university funding. It is possible to go to Boston if you actually want to have fun, but we are very removed from it and Brandeis doesn't participate in the inter-college transportation network with nearby colleges. People here are very open minded, except when it comes to the country of Israel. However, in class we were discussing a recent rash of homophobic incidents in residential dorms. Some people weren't happy with the gender presentations during some kind of a dorm rap. But I'm inclined to think Brandeis airs on the side of gay-friendly.",

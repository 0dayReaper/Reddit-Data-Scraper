Whatever you suggest, we'll consider adding. What's the TLDR of \u00d2\u00d3TD?:\n\n* Post your outfit of the day. See and like outfits around you, ordered closest to furthest\n* View users'\u00a0*public profiles*\n* Top profiles are highlighted on another page\n* A digital Do Not Disturb status lets others know if you are open to interactions\n* All content resets at midnight\n\nOur vision is to enhance real world interactions digitally, rather than replace them. We want everyone you ever see to eventually have an interesting digital public profile.\u00a0 For reference, \u00d2\u00d3TD is available  [Here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%C3%B3%C3%B2td/id1497395972)",

Basically with covid right now the commuter rail here runs weekdays but isn't running on weekends, and Brandeis is not running their shuttles to Harvard &amp; Back Bay (both ~30min trip) \n\nIf you know how to drive, have a car, and want to pay for a parking pass, it's about 30 min on the pike. Otherwise, until the covid restrictions lighten up, you'll be pretty stuck like me on weekends. There are express buses that run still, but they're pretty inconvenient to catch, and only really help if you're trying to get to the financial district. Pre covid I used to head into town all the time though both for work and to visit home so it's definitely doable if services come back",

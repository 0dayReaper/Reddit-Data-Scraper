    "postText": "Hey guys! I\u2019m excited to have been accepted to Brandeis but still debating commitment. I have plans to apply to grad/law school so I was wondering whether grade deflation is a real thing at Brandeis? \n\nHow is your experience approaching professors (asking for help, opportunities,\u2026)? \n\nHow do you find the social scene here, and since sb already asked this question, I want to inquire specifically about the clubs\u2019 activeness and school spirits!!\n\nAnd lastly, how do you find Boston helpful in your time at Brandeis?\n\nThank you!!!",

Not like some schools where the whole school rallies for football games, etc (we don't have a football team). But not sure if this was just me and my circles \n\nI'm not sure I understand the Boston question, but my first year or two I spent a lot of time visiting Boston and going to parties at BU/MIT, but as school picked up, it became less of a priority and I found myself going into the city a lot less often. It's great though and definitely still nice to be near.\n\nProfessors are amazing and generally are very eager to help if you reach out!",

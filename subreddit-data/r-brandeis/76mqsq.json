Does it have a heavy screenwriting component? Etc. \n\nFor context, I am also applying to NYU Tisch, Emerson, Colorado College, Wesleyan and Swarthmore",

Its not very production oriented but it does give you the opportunity to work on your own projects (the directing and screenwriting classes are amazing!). \nThe program itself is very very theory based and is mostly focused on the critical analysis of film (also known as film studies in most other universities). PM me if you want more info :) ",

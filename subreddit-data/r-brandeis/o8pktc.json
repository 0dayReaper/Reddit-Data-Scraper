I am personally not that into partying and more into focusing on academics, but it would be nice to see if they have an option and some variety when it comes to things to do. Also, what is the Greek life like at Brandeis?",

            "comment": "Hey! I graduated about 5 years ago now but couldn't resist jumping in. Brandeis is not a party school and many people who end up there feel similar to you. For this reason, there's a vibrant non-partying non-Greek social life. Personally, I fell into the Debate Team early into my freshman year. I had never done debate before but quickly found a tight group of friends through the team. Debating also massively helped me with public speaking &amp; articulating arguments (which actually helped with my essay writing). \n\nBecause I chose to attend competitions, I spent a lot of weekends staying at campuses across New England, attending the parties that sometimes took place after competitions, and meeting people (boyfriends) from other schools. The team receives a lot of funding, so all transportation &amp; registration costs were covered. I even traveled to England to compete at Oxford and Cambridge as an upperclassman. Some team mates traveled to India and elsewhere to attend the World Debate competitions.\n\nThere are still house parties on and off campus and some Greek life at Brandeis. I can't speak to that scene as I wasn't a part of it. But would recommend considering the debate team or a similar community. Of course, there's downsides to any club this intense &amp; tight knight. I pulled back from debating as an upperclassman to focus on other things. But I still have lifelong friends from the team. There's plenty of clubs to choose from and they will all make their pitch to you during the activities fair in the beginning of the year :-)",

            "comment": "The business major at Brandeis reflects their liberal arts academics. This can be good in the sense that you will be able to explore different options but can be bad in that you won't have a concentration like other business schools. However, this doesn't mean you can't be specialized in accounting or finance because there is a robust number of different classes. There is an initial barrier of a 1-page essay to declare the major but no requirement to declare it as a minor. \n\nThere are a bunch of core classes: https://www.brandeis.edu/business/undergraduate/requirements.html",

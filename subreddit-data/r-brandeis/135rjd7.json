I was recently accepted to Brandeis as a transfer student and I\u2019m considering going but just wanted some input from current students and alum first. \n\nFor some context I currently go to a NESCAC and I\u2019m planning on studying biochem or chem with aspirations to go into a PhD program or law school. Still waiting to hear back from most schools but my other option rn would be BU. Anything would be appreciated!",

            "comment": "i transferred to brandeis this year after doing two years at my last school. i wanted to do a biochemistry major, but i wouldn't have been able to fit everything into two years here based on the credits that transferred from my last school, so i went with a biology major instead. so i would set up a meeting with an advisor from each school before deciding to see how exactly each of your credits will transfer and if it would be a lot different between the schools. they do have a good introduction for transfer students here - you get put into a separate group from first years during orientation and get specific advice for transferring, and they put most of us in the same apartment building for housing. also, there are a lot of opportunities for research as an undergrad. but other than that the campus is pretty average, and it's one giant hill so walking between classes can be brutal - there is a shuttle but sometimes it just doesn't run lol. i think bu would probably be an overall better experience since it's actually in boston. also, brandeis doesn't guarantee housing for juniors and seniors so a lot of other students and i have to look for our own housing for next year :/",

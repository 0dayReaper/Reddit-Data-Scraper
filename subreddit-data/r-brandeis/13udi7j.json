The problem is, I do not know the campus that well. \n\nAre there any popular photo spots that you'd recommend? For example, a well-known building or a \"Brandeis University\" sign.\n\nThanks in advance!",

There are also pretty nature trails by the Charles River apartments (but this is a little off campus). The Boston view from skyline/the castle is also pretty depending on how clear of a day it is. Maybe take pictures by the department you got your degree in, like for science go to the SSC or for Heller school take shots there. Otherwise that\u2019s pretty much it for photogenic places on campus.",

But if he wants to do undergrad research to build a resume for grad school, brandeis is better. I was able to publish twice as an undergrad, and several of my classmates are attending Harvard, UChicago, Berkeley, etc on the back of their undergrad lab work. Undergrad research is what Brandeis does best",

            "comment": "My son is at Brandeis.  He is also a quiet, introverted kid who is thriving at Brandeis.   He wants to go on to graduate school (but not in materials chemistry).  I assume you're looking at [https://www.brandeis.edu/mrsec/](https://www.brandeis.edu/mrsec/).  They recently were awarded significant federal grant dollars which will fund undergrad research as well as graduate support.    \n\nI am so impressed with Brandeis.   He has gotten great advising; he is in small major and gets a lot of attention.   Sciences are a real strength.   \n\nHe clicked with students in his dorm freshman year and developed a satisfying social life.    The campus feels very welcoming.    He has, as they say, found his people.   \n\nHas your son had a chance to spend anytime on either campus ?   We're from the area and have had family at Tufts too so I'm familiar with the \"vibe\" and it is different.    I would say Tufts feels more dynamic, with a larger undergraduate student body on a smaller campus (in acreage) than Brandeis'.   The area around it is much buzzier, with Somerville / Medford being quite urban, and the red line (transit) being accessible to Cambridge and Boston.  It feels more like an urban campus, even though it certainly has a distinct quad.   Tufts students  are of course excellent students and Tufts retains its reputation as being in the business of preparing students for the professions.   I personally always feel the area around the campus feels very congested, but many students prefer that.  Dorms are average.  Otherwise, facilities seem quite nice.    \n\nBrandeis by contrast feels more bucolic while not being in the country.   The campus has a couple thousand fewer undergrads than Tufts with more acreage so it feels literally less crowded.  Students can still get into Boston easily.   It is a slower paced, more personal campus environment, with students coming to know each other.   Sports is not a high priority.  Club activities are.  My son , as I said, has really found himself there.   \n\nOne other thing to consider, as I'm sure you're aware:   Tufts is tougher to gain admission to than is Brandeis, although the profile of students who go to each school are almost identical, and both are highly selective.   So, it will very much matter that your son assesses his fit with both schools as that will no doubt play a role in who admits him.   If he isn't a good fit for Tufts, then ED won't make much difference, assuming he is quite competitive.  If he is a good fit for Brandeis, then ED will undoubtedly help.    Brandeis most definitely pays attention to fit.    Now that I know more about Brandeis, it is clear my son was a fit--scholarly, but passionate about his interests outside of academics, which he cultivated on his own.   He is an athlete but wasn't wanting to play in college.    He is the type of person who could easily become a professor or work in an interdisciplinary field.  Brandeis nurtures that kind of student.   \n\nPlease post what your student decides!  Good luck!",

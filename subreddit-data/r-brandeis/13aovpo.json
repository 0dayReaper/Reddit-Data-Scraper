    "postText": "hii im an incoming international student in the class of 2027, I'm planning on taking some summer courses before september. How difficult are these courses? should I stick with the 10, 20 level courses or should i challenge myself to try some more higher level corses that technically doesn't have any pre-requisites? also since i want to take these classes online, does the grading/ quality of teaching change significantly?",

            "comment": "Grading-wise, online classes would usually emphasize grading for take-home assignments, not exams, unless you were taking chem or something. If they\u2019re asynchronous, same deal. However, I would not recommend you take summer courses as an incoming freshman. Summer courses are highly accelerated and won\u2019t give you much of an edge in the fall, at least not one that would be worthwhile. Feel free to DM me with more questions (I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019ve taken a few), but I\u2019d say even intro courses should be avoided if you haven\u2019t even had normal courses yet. The numbers don\u2019t mean much for difficulty\u2014gen chem is numbered 11, but it\u2019s far more difficult than, say, some neuro electives numbered in the 140s.",

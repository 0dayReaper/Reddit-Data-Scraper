    "postText": "I'm Marcus a rising junior with my girlfriend as well. We are ideally looking for another person/couple to go in on a two bedroom apparentment with. Anyone is welcome obviously! LGBTQ+ friendly. We'd also be open if a group wanted to go in on a 3 bedroom. The plan is to stay here over the summer, so a one year lease till next June. Please reach out if interested at (781)-392-9650. Snap is zphelps-100. Insta: berubem2021.\n\nFor those who don't know the area: cost would be about 12-1500 a month. We'd sign a 1 year lease.\n\nLittle info about us:\nBoth very clean. We somewhat keep to ourselves. I love to cook! We both work in the area as well as school.",

    "postText": "\nI\u2019m a rising sophomore majoring in Sociology and want to find an internship or part time job for the several months on campus.  Don\u2019t have job type preference, whichever is okay. Just make sure I can work remotely on my own computer and talk with a lot of people if possible( Due to corona, I can\u2019t come to the campus physically) I want to somehow feel connected with the campus, yet at the same time practice speaking English since English is not my native language. Does the school career center helps? How about academic advisors?",

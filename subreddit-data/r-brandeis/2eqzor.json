    "postText": "Hey y'all,\n\nWelcome to the new students and welcome back to returning students...despite the combination of brilliance and nerdiness seemingly embedded in the genetics of Brandeis students/alumni, this subreddit is fairly inactive.  We mods are pretty busy and we're all alumni so we're not constantly posting material to the sub.  That being said, I'd love to see more activity on this sub and would welcome the addition of a new mod--especially (read: preferably) a current student.  If anyone is interested, please \n\nWe're working on updating the visuals and will consider any other requests/suggestions for updating the front page, especially useful features we might add to the sidebar.\n\nAs far as possible features for this sub, one that I'd like to incorporate is a regularly recurring (maybe once or twice a semester?) Ask An Alumni post...I think it'd be a cool way to connect current/prospective students with actual alumni.  I'll make a separate post about that, but that's an example of a feature for this sub that I'm going to implement.  If there are other features of interest, feel free to share them!\n\nOtherwise, best of luck to new and returning students",

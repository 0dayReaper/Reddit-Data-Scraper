    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI was wondering if there are any students who contracted an acute case of covid-19 and had to seek inpatient services - were you covered by the school's insurance (BCBS) ? How much did you need to pay after coverage?\n\nI'm planning to join Brandeis for Spring 2021 for my graduate studies and am an international student. I was wondering about the insurance coverage for covid-19. I have read up on Brandeis coverage on universityhealthplans.com but there was not much information regarding covid-19 so I'm trying my luck here:)\n\nThanks!",

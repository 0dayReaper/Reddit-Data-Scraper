I understand identifying with your alma mater but the level of downvoting is hilarious. \n\nAnyway, if you take this seriously, she released the text of what she would have said and I defy you to find anything but beautiful ideas about humanism and the protection of women's rights. \n\nAnd praise for your university.\n\nhttp://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304512504579493410287663906?mg=reno64-wsj",

            "comment": "&gt; In the magazine Reason, Ayaan Hirsi Ali stated that not just 'radical Islam' but 'Islam' must be defeated. She stated: \"Islam, period. Once it\u2019s defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It\u2019s very difficult to even talk about peace now. They\u2019re not interested in peace.\"[80]\n\nThis is not someone we should support. Islam is not a violent religion even though there are violent muslims. ",

    "postText": "Hey, Brandeis. Lately I have been unhappy with our school. The academics are astounding, but I just feel like on some level I don't connect with a lot of my freshmen friends. I feel like I just have hundreds of friendly acquaintances and one or two friends. I know it's the \"October Slump\" or whatever, too. I guess what I'm wondering is this: did any of you have similar experiences? I'm thinking of transferring. If you didn't, are you happy with the decision (and how did you come about being happy?). Thanks for any help. ",

            "comment": "This sounds similar like my Brandeis experience.  While I somewhat regret not attending more social events or talking to people outside of my small group of friends, I loved my time at Brandeis. I treasure the memories of funtimes with my few close friends. I've never really been affected by the 'slumps' because they seemed so much better than the ones I went through in high school. The rainy fall and spring months do seem to dampen the entire campus's spirit.\nPerhaps consider giving it a few more weeks, but you can still work on your transfer application in the meantime if you'd like.",

The way I ended up getting there was by being more open to doing things with people I didn't know super well and basically trying not to say no to social interaction. Getting a study group going with people in your major can also help, making study time in to bonding time. I hope that helps at all. College is a tough transition for pretty much everyone.",

Yes, I had a few friends by the end of September of my freshman year, but it was really joining clubs that gave me a pretty solid friend base.  Find something you have even half of an interest in, and start hanging around with those people.",

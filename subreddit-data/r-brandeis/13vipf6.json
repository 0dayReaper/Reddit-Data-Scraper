For those who are undertaking or have graduated from the program, what are some of your tips for success? \n\nI'm talking about getting part-time work experience during the semester, summer internships and full-time offers as SWE, especially in big tech (although I know as a non-major, it's an ambitious goal but better dream big right?) \n\nI'm so excited to start this Fall and make the best out of what Brandeis has to offer :)",

            "comment": "Congrats!  Very recently graduated undergrad here now working in big tech as a SWE (still in the boston area) - I saw you mentioned it and a few activities as goals and I also did all that.\n\nUnfortunately I think brandeis doesn\u2019t give enough career support to its CS students (both undergrad and grad), and Brandeis CS isn\u2019t as rigorous compared to other schools.  The things I\u2019d recommend would be:\n\n- Work on personal projects for your resume and to use as talking points\n- Be competent with leetcode and white boarding\n- Be ready to shotgun applications to companies (I know a few lists, you can DM me if you\u2019d like)\n- Masters students had some weekly coffee and donuts thing, might be worth going to meet peers\n\nSuper important to be proactive on this and do a lot of it yourself, especially seeing the way the economy/industry is veering. \n\nFor classes:\n- Don\u2019t skip out on fundamentals, i.e data structure and algorithms.  It\u2019s critical and interviewing won\u2019t be fun without it.\n- Don\u2019t focus necessarily on the code/language.  Actual coding is a small part of software engineering and people get misguided into focusing all their time on perfecting a language.  Be competent with concepts like OOP, basic design patterns, debugging etc.\n- Use office hours and also use the internet a lot, i.e search things up instead of getting blocked\n- Don\u2019t worry about GPA\n\nFor professors:\n- Take classes with Hickey if you want an easy grade, but will be proactive enough to self study.  His quiz format is really forgiving.  He likely won\u2019t respond to your emails though, so knock on his door or hound a TA.\n- Antonella is a polarizing figure.  Some love her, some don\u2019t.  Might be \u201ctough love\u201d.  She did a good job pushing women in stem within the major.  She\u2019s returning now after a year at Tufts.  \n- Mairson has a particular teaching style that is a bit loose and needs a good bit of attention to follow.  He is understanding and has some interesting hobbies and research going on.\n- Iraklis joined a few years back and has always been super kind to interact with, though I\u2019ve heard his classes can be a bit hard.\n- Pito teaches some interesting courses like robots and software entrepreneurship, and he\u2019s occasionally slotted into core classes.  He has a wealth of entrepreneurship knowledge. \n\nOverall though Brandeis is a solid option and I would highly recommend it.  It has lots of advantages such as its size and academic culture.  That\u2019s a good bit but happy to give more insight, particularly about internships (I did a lot do them) or jobs.  Feel free to ask or dm!",

I\u2019ve noted them all down in my notebook and will definitely keep in mind in my 2 years here. If you have some time, can we chat over dm please? I\u2019d love to gain some more insights. Feel free to dm me and I\u2019ll reply asap. Hopefully the time difference works as I\u2019m in Australia atm. And congrats on all your successes! I know many Brandeis alumni have been successful in (big) tech so you guys/gals definitely made the best out of what little Brandeis offers :)",

                    "comment": "Just to add to this...\n\nAs a non-major MSCS (we call it MS4, meaning 4 semesters) student, there are two things that make landing a job/internship harder. First, by the time most internship applications are due, you haven't even finished your first semester. How can you convince an employer to hire you, despite the fact that you literally haven't passed a single CS class? Second, many companies have policies to pay grad students more, meaning that the expectations may be higher.\n\nMany in the MS4 program find internships late in the Spring, and quite a few had no internships their first summer. A few have even extended their program by a semester, just to be eligible for internships for a second summer. \n\nThat being said, many have gone on to find good jobs as software engineers. It just takes patience and hardwork. Everything /u/meowo_w said about being proactive is doubly important for MS4 students. \n\nAlso, a few things about professors (IMHO):\n\n* I'm in the \"love Antonella\" camp. I'd recommend her for your core classes. \n* Iraklis is leaving Brandeis. Unfortunate, because he was IMO the best professor of the entry level courses.\n* In your second year, if you can, take \"Software Engineering Capstone\" with Pito, if it's offered. Difficult, but very valuable class.\n* I agree completely with the Hickey comment. Easy A, but the classes are useless if you don't put in the effort to actually learn.",

    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nMy daughter just got accepted to Brandeis and it is one of her top choices.  We would like to come visit the school informally in a few weeks.  She is planning to study French/ linguistics and is generally sort of a literature/ theater type.  Is there anyone on this reddit who might be able to answer some questions for us and/ or give us a socially-distanced tour come mid-April?  I see that the official student ambassadors skew more towards economics/ biology and  I am afraid my daughter will take that to mean there aren't any humanities/ arts students to be found... (Other interests: Jewish studies/ LGBTQ issues/ International relations/ and travel in general!!!)  Thanks so much!!!",

If you\u2019re looking to find someone else who might represent your daughters interests, feel free to PM me or check out [Brandeis Welcome to College ](https://brandeis.welcometocollege.com)",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I had some random questions about Brandeis since I'm an incoming student and couldn't find much online- I hope this is okay!\n\n1. How do people treat/view MKTYP students? I'm joining as one and am very nervous about being made fun of. I plan to be hush-hush about it but was wondering in case there are moments where being exposed as one is unavoidable.\n\n2. Do you have any advice on resources to utilize as a student that might typically be overlooked or underused by people?\n\n3. How should I best go about figuring out what majors I'm interested in? I know I probably should focus on checking off the core requirements but was wondering if things like clubs were a good option since adding/dropping classes a lot probably wouldn't be great long term.\n\n4. Does Brandeis have grade deflation or inflation? Or does it depend on your major? I understand that it's generally a rigorous school.\n\nThat's all, sorry if it was a bit much. Thanks everyone!",

Use the library a lot, the shuttle buses to travel to Boston, the gym, go to events all over campus (especially culture club ones) for food and a good time. \n\n3. Do you have a career path you wanna go into? Were you particular good at anything in high school? You should join any clubs that you want to, you can drop any of them. And there\u2019s this thing called the shop period at the beginning of each semester that you do to see which classes you\u2019re interested in. Feel free to drop any you don\u2019t like. \n\n4. It definitely depends on major.\n\nPm if you have any more questions, I got you.",

            "comment": "1. Honestly still don't 100% know what it is. A lot of people in the program are loud and proud about it (sweatshirts with the program name, etc.) so I wouldn't be too worried about being judged\n2. Out of the way study spots. A lot of the academic buildings have little rooms you can get work done in during building hours (or after, just don't leave your stuff locked in there) if you get tired of the library\n3. If you don't have any initial direction, just pick whatever seems interesting to you (especially because there's a shopping period). Also, go to meet the majors events (especially ones that are exclusively for one or two majors), I found one of my current majors through them. There are a lot of programs you may never have heard of that could be a match for you.\n4. Depends on the major",

            "comment": "1. Since I am not in the program I can\u2019t speak on what they experience, but I personally haven\u2019t seen any other students be judgmental. If there are issues Brandeis has multiple support systems within the program itself as well as advisors etc. \n\n2. I\u2019d say get super familiar with the library page since there are more resources such as softwares to use for all classes, access to several databases, and the library loan system that can get you resources from other institutions for free. Also be sure to ask upperclassman in your field what they recommend (you can start with the Roosevelt fellows and UDRs)\n\n3. I would take advantage of the add drop period, but don\u2019t stress too much your first year since you can check off core courses that sound interesting. Once you find what interests you the major will follow. Especially since you are in MKTYP you have time to find what subject area you enjoy. I think this summer you should go in with an idea about your general likes (for example would you find yourself happier writing an essay or in a lab) and then go off of that. \n\n4. I honestly don\u2019t know the generic answer for that. It\u2019s mostly depends on factors outside of year, especially since people take courses in all sorts of orders.\n\nI hope you have a great time at Brandeis, best of luck!",

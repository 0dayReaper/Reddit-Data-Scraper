What made it great for me: strong academics, fantastic sciences prep, great social life and culture, really enjoyed the campus, clubs and events, proximity to Boston. Students were more self competitive than with each other. What more could you want? ",

Although if you want to be in a city, go for BU--Brandeis is \"near\" Boston but it's not the same as being in the thick of it. \n\nWilliam &amp; Mary's probably about the same (suburban, medium-sized) and almost certainly has a worse neuro program (and a comparable econ program), so if it's between those too come here, unless you're determined to get warmer weather.",

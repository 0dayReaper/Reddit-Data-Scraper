    "postText": "So I\u2019m a freshman here and like most ppl obviously, this wasn\u2019t my first choice school. Before I even came here I was already thinking abt transferring to another school after one semester like BU. but I\u2019m ngl I really don\u2019t mind it here, however I\u2019ve had and heard so many conversations of people saying they want to transfer next semester or next year whatever it may be and I was wondering how much of it actually holds true? Is it like a thing that ppl that come here always have transferring at the back of the school? I\u2019m personally gonna still submit my applications for the spring semester at  another school just cause I already spent a bit of time on it but if I don\u2019t get in I wouldn\u2019t even care as I like here so far. does Brandeis have a reputation for having many ppl wanting to leave?",

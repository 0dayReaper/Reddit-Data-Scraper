    "postText": "Brandeis seems like an amazing school, and I'd love to go. I'm worried that because of my grades, I may not be accepted.\n\nI went to high school in Israel, (US citizen, raised in Virginia) and because of the language barrier, my grades aren't amazing. (B average) \n\nI don't have SAT scores, or AP classes, none of those things. \n\nWhat can I do to make myself more appealing? I already have a (hopefully) great essay and a lot of extracurriculars. (Mostly work experience, I spend most of my time working)\n\n\nDoes going to a foreign high school give me any advantage at all?",

Bs are fine grades, they won't make or break you. What really matters is why you got those grades. Mentioning the language barrier will definitely aid you.    \n    \nWhat counselors are looking for is the fact that you took the opportunities your school has to offer. They read regionally so they're probably familiar with your high school too, and they know what kinds of classes they have. If you never had the opportunity to take the SAT or AP classes, that's fine! \n   \nI wouldn't say that going to a foreign highschool is an advantage or disadvantage, but definitely mention that it was a factor of your grades with the language barrier! You can make it more interesting by talking about what you learned going to a foreign high school and how this aided/barred you.",

Should I write a detailed explanation in the additional information section of my application? \n\nAlso, is a good photography portfolio something that may make me stand out, or is that not something they look at?",

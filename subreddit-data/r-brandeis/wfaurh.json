When there was a fire she was able to get her desktop replaced, and when some of her Chem books were stolen she was able to make a claim and purchase them again. Insurance isn't absolutely required, but it's a good idea if you don't want to pay out of pocket for any stolen or damaged items.",

If you have to make a claim on your home policy, it drives your rating down for even a small claim in your dorm. Keeping the dorm insurance separate keeps your rating high on your home insurance.",

Heller was incredible. The camaraderie between all of the students, within and between programs was excellent. Everyone seemed happy to be around their peers and multiple people would come up to me in the building to ask what program I was a part of because they had never seen me before. \nI found that the classes were engaging and taught by professors with practical experience. Many of the classes are very heavy on group projects, which is something to keep in mind if you feel strongly one way or the other about that sort of work.",

    "postText": "I'm moving from a huge city university, which isn't very different from the city itself. I'm hoping to find a better sense of community here.\n\n* What's the size like? How often do you see the same people?\n\n* What do the students you know do with themselves, outside of class?\n\n* I get that Brandeis is either super diverse or 100% Jewish based on what statistics you look at, but I don't care about that. What about diversity in other realms? Do people like different types of music? Is it easy to have a conversation about something like philosophy?\n\n* What is the overall community sense?\n\nI'm sorry if these questions are clicky, but I'm starved for something relatable. Thank you for your answers.",

The size is a pretty comfortable size, obviously on the smaller end but pretty big for only having ~3000 undergrads. I do see my friends a lot but there are always new people to meet. \n\n2. There are over 200 clubs, in addition to various other activities so they are all off doing various things. I'm in 2 different music ensembles for the most part. \n\n3. The people here are more nerdy than elsewhere methinks but I think there's a pretty good diversity of people. Again with all the clubs it'll be fairly easy to find your place. My friend specifically has had conversations with strangers about philosophy if that's your thing =p\n(Also it is nowhere near 100% jewish. I think my old non-denominational high school was more jewish than Brandeis)\n\n4. Overall people are fairly nice and there is a good sense of community even with professors and students. I like it :]\n\nAlso cliche not clicky =p",

            "comment": "1) There are about 3200 undergrad. You might see the same people everyday, you might hardly ever see someone. Someone I went to high school with is at Brandeis with me and I have seen him 4 times total since August.\n\n2) 260+ clubs, shuttles to take you off campus, shows every weekend, parties are available if you want them. Everyone is able to find a way to keep themselves busy.\n\n3) No matter what you like, there is bound to be someone else on campus that likes the same thing. I have had many philosophical conversations with friends and everyone comes from such different backgrounds (interest-wise and religion-wise) so it's always entertaining to talk to someone about what they're into because their answer is sure to be something to talk about.\n\n4) The community is amazing. Everyone cares. Everyone is happy. Everyone is looking out for each other. I have never felt so welcomed and loved by a group of people in my life. It isn't hard to be happy at Brandeis.",

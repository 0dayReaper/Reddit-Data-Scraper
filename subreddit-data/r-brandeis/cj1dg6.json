    "postText": "Hello! My name is Sarah Dodd and I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Connecticut. I am seeking LGBTQIA+ identified undergraduate college students in the United States to participate in an anonymous, on-line survey. On average, it takes about 15 minutes to complete. The purpose of the study is to shine a light on the sexual assault campus climate for LGBTQIA+ students so as to inform response and prevention efforts on college campuses across the United States. \n\nYour voice matters!\n\nTo access the survey please follow this link:\n\n[https://uconn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_7Pt9Mi4B0MFoMnz](https://uconn.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7Pt9Mi4B0MFoMnz)\n\nThank you for considering this invitation to participate. If you have any questions, you can find my direct contact information at the link or just comment on this post. Thank you!",

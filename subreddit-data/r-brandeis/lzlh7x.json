    "postText": "Hi! While I am still waiting for the admission decision for MSBA at Brandeis, I am doing my research about the school and the program (an international student, the situation doesn't allow me to visit in person at the moment). I haven't found many threads about MS Business Analytics at Brandeis. Though the curriculum of the program seems very complete and vigorous and the school seems like a great place to meet and make driven friends, I am hoping to hear more insights about the program.  Can anyone share their experience, including any pros and cons, about the MSBA program?",

The program involves alot of statistics knowledge, R and Python. I am enjoying my program so far. Let me know if you have any questions:) I'm open to help!",

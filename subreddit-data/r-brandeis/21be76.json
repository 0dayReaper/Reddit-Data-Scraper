    "postText": "There's this Chinese girl who I'm pretty sure lives there. This is what I've seen so far:\n\n1) First time I saw her was in the group study room. I was sitting there alone after my friend had left, when she comes in: \"Oh! Hi.. can I sit here?\" I'm like sure.. but that's weird why would you do that. Anyway, she proceeds to sit on her phone, surf youtube, bullshit stuff like that she didn't come to study that's for sure. I get tired of her shit and leave.\n\n2) I see her ALL THE TIME at the lounge. Usually either A) On her way between the kitchen and \"her\" room, or B) Sleeping on the couch.\n\n3) Everytime I leave late at night (11-12 ish), I've seen her go into her room and not come out. Twice I've tried to go in just to make sure that I wasn't making shit up, and the door has been LOCKED. She actually locks herself in the group room at night.\n\nI have no idea what to do with this information though. If she actually lives there, that's sad as hell. But on the other hand, there gotta be a better solution than living in the student lounge when you're broke. Should I do something or just mind my own business here?",

If you are friendly or aquaninted with any other Chinese students, consider having them ask around before you contact any administrators or staff.  Brandeis is pretty small, so you should be able to find a connection.  There may not be much you can do, and honestly, as long as she isn't trashing the place or making it impossible for other people to work when they need to, it might be just be better to leave her be.",

She's not really trashing anything, but she's always occupying her room ofc. I am leaning towards doing nothing atm. I don't feel the need to (potentially) fuck up someone's life because they are hogging a group room that I never intend to use anyway.",

You'd just create enemies and honestly, if the janitors can't be bothered to notice and report it to someone who cares, why should you?  It might be interesting to know her story, but if she's Chinese-Chinese (any you are non-Asian) then she almost certainly won't be willing to share it with you.  If you wanted to be really passive-aggressive, you could start by expressing concern that she lacks decent living space, but honestly, I'd just let her be.  If someone else needs that room around finals, let it be their problem to evict her.  ",

If she was just crashing there on occasion, that's one thing, but it seems that she is taking up an entire room that is public and group space and using it as personal living quarters. That's not fair to other students and not cool on her part. I would report it.",

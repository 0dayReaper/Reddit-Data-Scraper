    "postText": "I am a high school student, who is going to apply to Brandeis this fall, and yesterday I was attracted to this cross-register policy that Brandeis offers. I wonder is it true that undergraduate students in Brandeis can cross-register for all courses in those schools listed in that policy(e.g. tufts/mit/bc)?",

Obviously you have to plan your schedule carefully as you might be taking the train or bus to Boston or Medford (Medford is where Tufts is). You can apply for a subsidy to pay for transportation but you have to apply at the beginning of the semester.",

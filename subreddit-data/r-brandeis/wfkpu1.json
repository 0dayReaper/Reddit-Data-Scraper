    "postText": "Hi there, I am an incoming transfer student and my dorm is in the 567 south street apartments. I don't know much about the building other than that it is filled with transfer students and it is suite style, apartments with two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. Does anyone know anything about these dorms like whether people like them, if students can park their car there etc?",

It\u2019s cool tho because you feeel like you\u2019re off campus even though it\u2019s super close. They tend to experience a lot of maintenance problems tho",

    "postText": "I\u2019m not really writing this for anyone but myself. But I was just accepted for the class of 2026. My mom went to Brandeis and this pandemic I have been home just me and my mom taking care of my severely special needs brother. He was residential before the pandemic, but I sacrificed my entire social life and I got way worse grades trying to help care for him at home. I still got in though. I was accepted. Thank you Brandeis. I am very happy with myself.",

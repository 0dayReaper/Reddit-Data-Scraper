My apartment is a 2 bedroom that comes in at $2950/mo without any utilities included - and that was one of the cheaper apartments I saw. Even the most expensive housing on campus is cheaper than splitting the average Waltham apartment, plus you don't need to buy furniture.\n\nThat said, I suspect there are more, cheaper student housing options with Sept 1 lease starts than what I was able to find for a spring move. You have to plan in advance, though, since many landlords square away their Sept 1 leases by Feb or March.",

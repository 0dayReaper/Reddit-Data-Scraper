Insatiable institution invades individual privacy in an attempt to increase investments. \n\nI felt that I was treated poorly by the administration and received a subpar undergraduate education given the funds that I spent. Hell, my year abroad was the most educational portion of my undergraduate career and I don't think I should have to explain any of this to the Brandeis tax collectors. Is there any way to opt out of harassment?",

You would figure they would at least wait til you were established before hitting you up for cash. I just told them not to call me again and said I would donate when I was good and ready. It has worked so far.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone so I\u2019ve been looking to attend Brandeis for over a year now and have been emailing reps for the same amount of time.\n\nBasically I\u2019m very afraid that I won\u2019t be accepted since I have a 2.78gpa (the first two years of high school I did nothing and just let my grades be) I have a drastic upwards curve though and the curve happened as soon as I started taking multiple AP classes and IB courses. (I\u2019m an IB diploma candidate)\n\nMy act is a 28 but I\u2019m attempting to reach a 30-32 on my last act and believe I\u2019ll be able to reach it.\n\nMy question is should I apply through MKTYP or go through the ED route, any suggestions? \n\nAlso tips would be greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "It's hard to say whether you will or will not be accepted, but it's definitely good that you have an upward curve. If there's anything that happened your first two years that contributed to lower grades, make sure to explain that somewhere in the application.    \nWhat made you start to take grades more seriously? That can be a great thing to talk about on the application. The counselors love to see growth, and they're more concerned with how you are as a student now than earlier in HS.    \n     \nI'd recommend applying ED, because the MKTYP program is highly competitive, only a 10% acceptance rate vs the 30% for general admission. That program is meant for those who have faced significant barriers during their high school career, though, so if you feel that applies to you and that you would benefit from a transitional year definitely consider it.",

            "comment": "Just after reading the page on the MYKPT program, you do not qualify if you had access to AP/IB classes and/or honors programs. So ED is definitely the way to go. \n\nI had slightly better stats, and upwards curve when I applied (late in the cycle, not ED) for undergrad in 2013, and was waitlisted and rejected. \n\nI think it's certainly worth a chance, but you really need to sell yourself on why Brandeis is the school for you in the essay. (i.e. you want to cultivate a career in biological science and you would be THRILLED to take classes and/or do research under the highly-regarded professors. Or if you find that you have a special connection to Brandeis's Jewish ties and culture. Or if you have found that you would fit into the community because you think x student group would help your career and help you serve the community). \n\nAs an contrasting example of how my undergrad essay did me no favors, I said something to the effect of \"I really liked the architecture here and it made me feel that Brandeis is a different place for different people like me and I really vibe with all of it\" (even though I had no interest in architecture). \n\nMy point here is that if your stats are below-par, your essay will have to give the adcom some compelling reason to overlook that, and that reason needs to be really specific to the career you're aspiring to, and not just \"vibes\" or \"Brandeis is the best institution I could hope for\".  \n\nAll that being said you should absolutely apply to numerous safety schools and not count on being admitted unless your stats are significantly above the averages. Also take a moment to honestly and dutifully calculate how much financial aid you really expect to get, because Brandeis tuition is expensive as sin. (sticker price of $50k a year is $200k before you add in living expenses and loan interest. Brandeis is a good school, but you really need to consider if it's *\"$200k - financial aid versus whatever state school charges\"* good for you and your career. If you do apply get rejected, it's ok to be sad about it, but keep in mind there are many many institutions other than Brandeis that can take you on the very same path you hope Brandeis could. When I was rejected to Brandeis, it was my #1 choice, and I ended up going to my state school with much bitterness. In retrospect, I think it all worked out in my favor, MUCH more cheaply for my parents and I, the quality of my undergrad education was not particularly worse (albeit a little GPA-un-inflated), and I'm back here for grad school anyways.",

The thing that got me extremely interested in Brandeis was the story one of the admissions rep gave when I met her as well as the Jewish ties since I\u2019ve been writing my IB extended essay over why Judaism turned nihilist in 20th century Germany. Also thank you for your input and I\u2019m glad you got into Brandeis for post grad (must\u2019ve made you feel great after being rejected 4 years ago) thank you for the advice!",

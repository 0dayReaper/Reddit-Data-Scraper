There\u2019s something to do every night/weekend, but it\u2019s also the type of campus that if you want to stay in and hang out, no one is going to judge you for it. I tend to find that people who complain, are the same people not making an effort.",

We\u2019re obviously not a party school or anything but if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort I think the social scene is fine",

            "comment": "I think it is horrendous. It is very much for certain type of people (more introverted?) and overall the brandeis population is notably more awkward overall than other schools. But ofc you can get lucky people with the people you meet and everything will be fine.\n\nThe campus here is also REALLY ugly and not conducive to a good social environment (it is the only school on Niche to get a D- ranking for campus). It is really small but there arent many places you can naturally meet other people, you have to kinda go out of your way to do so. Additionally the location is a far cry from the \"near Boston\" town Brandeis advertises it as being. Most of your time will be spent on this 1970's crusty stale campus and way less interaction with students from other schools unless you have a car. Waltham is also rather boring.\n\nIf you don't like the feelings of big schools and prefer being more closed off/small scale than maybe Brandeis is for you. I am definitely biased bc I hate it here but it is what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: You will def be able to meet people if that is what you are worried about. I just think most are awkward but maybe it is just me.",

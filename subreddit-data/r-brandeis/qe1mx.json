This is a serious issue and is not a matter to be joked about and taken lightly.\n\nThis flyer is simply grammatically unsound.  If it said \"Brandeisians Face AIDS\", that would be acceptable.  Alternatively, \"Brandeis: Face AIDS\" would work.  However, this Tay-Sachs fucktard posted this fucking piece of shit.",

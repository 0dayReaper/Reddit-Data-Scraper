Meal exchange gives you a number of swipes that you can use at food places on campus that aren\u2019t dining halls (Dunkin\u2019 donuts, einstein\u2019s bagels, etc.). Points are basically debit cash tied to your account that you can use to buy things at a meal exchange place or at the on-campus grocery store.",

    "postText": "I was looking at the pre med advising sites and they gave an example of hospitals that people went to to volunteer, but it feels a little unrealistic given Brandeis's location. The nearest hospital is 40 min away and the furthest was 1 hr and 30 min away. If someone were to volunteer for at least 3 hours, they would have spent roughly 5 hours total? I just wanted to see if this is an actual experience that occurs or if they is some alternate method of transportation other then taking a bus I haven't considered yet.",

            "comment": "It's common to volunteer on weekends or over the summer when you have a bit more time.\n\nThere's the commuter rail, both the Brandeis bus and MBTA buses, and even Brandeis vans for organized hospital volunteer visits like through the Office of Community Service.\n\nMany of your faculty and staff are commuting at least that far each way every day, so while it's hard to wrap your head around as a high schooler, 40 minute to 1 and a half commutes are within the realm of what's typical in the working world in the Boston area.",

Budgeting out time is important and yes an hour each way is normal. It costs around $20 total per day with commuter rail and subway tickets.",

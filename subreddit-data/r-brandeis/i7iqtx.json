    "postText": "Hey, so I just moved in today and am currently having a helluva lot of issues with it. So, I can connect w my computer to both wifis easily, but for some reason, I can't figure it out on my phone. It won't really let me connect to the eduroam one most of the time (probably because I'm using that for my computer), but on both, it randomly sets back the date to 12/25/2000 and nothing works. It also has logged me out of snap multiple times for no reason. Can someone explain what's going on with this? Thanks.",

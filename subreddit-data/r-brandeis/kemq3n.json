I wanted to get excited for this school because I\u2019m really going to miss my family back at home. \n\nAre there any fun things to do in someone\u2019s free time, traditions, classes, in Brandeis?\n\nI hear some bad things about the school\u2014 meal plans, unattractive buildings, no school spirit. Are these things true?",

            "comment": "I graduated in 2017 so take this with a grain of salt, but...\n\nThings I loved:\n\n-  the academics. This may be cliche but I really enjoyed almost every one of my classes, including the gen ed requirements. I had professors at the very top of their fields, and many of them are excited to meet with you personally, give career/general advice, and I am still in contact with some of my favorites. \n\n-  the library. I'm biased because this was my work study for three of my four years, but the collection and online resources are fantastic. You can get pretty much anything you want via interlibrary loan and even rent ipads/laptops/headphones/chargers for 24 hours at a time. The building is great to study in and the staff is really eager to help you succeed.\n\n-  the extracurriculars. I was involved with Brandeis TV, BAMCO, WBRS and Spectrum. All were great, there is considerable money invested in each so opportunities are abundant, I highly recommend getting involved with whatever interests you. Volunteer organizations are especially great at Brandeis and if you volunteer enough, you get a special medal at graduation! \n\n-  study abroad. The study abroad office is great in my experience. I went abroad to Nepal the semester after the big earthquake there and the staff made sure I was prepared and even checked in with me while I was over there. I applied for and received a scholarship through the study abroad office that ended up covering my airfare there and back, and I got full credit for all 4 of the classes I took abroad, which is rare for college.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n-  the food. Also cliche, but yeah, the options are not great, the meal plans are expensive, and the hours are really hard to work around if you have late classes. Eventually I gave up and got a book of microwave recipes and cooked most of my meals in the dorms\n\n-  the dorms. I lived on campus for two years, one in a freshman dorms (obviously) and one in the castle. Ultimately you're paying a shit ton of money for very little. The lottery system is a clusterfuck and most people end up with their last choice unless you get a great number.  I moved off campus as soon as I could and it worked much better for me. YMMV.\n\n-  the disability services office. You may or may not need this, but I have a couple well documented disabilities and it was like pulling teeth to get the accommodations I needed. I remember I had surgery in my freshman year and had both legs in aircasts so needed a shuttle to and from classes--the disability services staff kept forgetting to schedule my pickups (they're the only ones who can do it) and I missed one of my finals because I just couldn't get to it. My prof was very understanding and let me take it at a different time but...not cool.\n\nAnyway, congrats on your acceptance, you will have a great experience! Any college will have its downsides but I don't regret going there at all and I've been gainfully employed in my field since I graduated. I also moved 7 hours away to attend. You're welcome to DM me with any questions or just to talk.",

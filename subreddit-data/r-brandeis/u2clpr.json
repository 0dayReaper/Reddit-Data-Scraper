After contacting an advisor earlier, I was told to check my Brandeis portal. However, I never made a portal account, never received an email about making one, and I couldn\u2019t when I tried on my own because I don\u2019t have a student ID? Would anyone be able to help? :(",

I\u2019ve done that and can access the website, but don\u2019t know where to navigate to see my financial aid info from there. Sorry if there\u2019s something obvious I\u2019m not getting, this doesn\u2019t feel like a good first impression lol\n\nEdit: NEVER MIND I FOUND IT, IT\u2019S BEEN RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE THIS ENITRE TIME. \ud83d\ude13 THANK YOU!!",

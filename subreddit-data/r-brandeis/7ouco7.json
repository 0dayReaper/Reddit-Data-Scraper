            "comment": "I majored in physics at Brandeis and did research that was under the materials umbrella. I can't speak to other departments but the professors in the physics department were very accessible to do research with. There was not a huge breadth of physics courses offered but the standard track was fine for the most part. It was definitely a plus to be able to take well-taught physics courses at a university with a variety of interesting non-science classes as well.",

            "comment": "I am a recently graduated physics grad student and the MRSEC is really great when it comes to the specific fields under its purview. Having a huge chunk of the science departments focused on one or two narrow topics covered by the MRSEC is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the research performed in those topics is truly excellent, including some of the leading professors in their field. Many of them are also more than willing to take on undergrads (I mentored 5 different undergrads in our lab during my 7 years). The downside is that, if those couple specific topics aren't interesting to you, there are relatively few options left for you to pursue.\n\nI would recommend looking through the [Brandeis MRSEC page](http://www.brandeis.edu/mrsec/research/index.html) and see if the research is actually interesting to you. Keep in mind that Zvonimir Dogic is in the process of moving to a different university, so the active matter options going forward are limited. If you have questions, I am more than happy to answer them.",

So basically if I want to do Mat Sci here I need to specialize in Membranes or Active Matter? I'm not sure if you attended Brandeis for undergraduate but if so do they offer matsci courses? Thanks for the answer so far I really appreciate you replying.",

                            "comment": "I did not attend Brandeis for undergrad, so I can't speak too much to that program other than the couple intro courses I TA'd. As far as research other than membranes and active matter, there are other options still within the departments. (I know the physics department the best, so that is what I will restrict my answer to.)\n\nYou said that you are into computational material science, so you may want to check out the [Mike Hagan group](http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/physics/hagan/) in the physics department which focuses on computational physics. They do active matter and membrane simulation work that fits in with the focus of the MRSEC, but they also do some other work related to viral capsid assembly.\n\nIf experimental work is more your speed, then you could check out [Ben Rogers's group](http://www.rogers-lab.com/). He is a relatively recent hire that is doing some interesting DNA-coated colloid based experiments. At least when I was still there, he regularly had several undergrads in the lab because being a relatively new professor, he didn't have a large pool of grad students to pull from. Another group to check out would be [Seth Fraden's group](http://www.brandeis.edu/facultyguide/person.html?emplid=874e8fc1518516894b17ccf902994e0d59a8e48c). He does some research into uses of the BZ reaction, protein crystallization, and liquid crystals. This is all not to mention the high energy side of the physics department (think CERN/particle physics) which is very much computational physics on a day to day basis. \n\nSorry for the long answer, but this is just the physics department, each of the other departments has a lot of research invested into the MRSEC focus areas, true. However, each of the professors typically also have their own pet research that interests them outside of a MRSEC focus area and some professors research might not fit into the MRSEC neatly at all ([see the circadian rhythm stuff that recently won a Nobel this past year](http://www.brandeis.edu/now/2017/october/rosbash-nobel-prize.html)). Good luck in your college hunting, and if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.",

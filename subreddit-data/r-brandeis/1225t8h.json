But it sucked at nearly every college I visited as well. You can have a car if you want but have to park it at a lot that\u2019s far away. No one really does.",

And people are really nice and welcoming here.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're looking for a party school, Brandeis isn't it. There's a small minority of party goers (the frat bros and sorority sisters mostly) but other than that, people look to have fun on campus.\n\nFood is eh. Nothing special. Some days are better than others. I wouldn't say it's bad overall though.\n\nYou're not allowed to have your car until junior year unless you get special permission. However, there's a train station literally on campus that takes you straight to Boston, and there's also a free university shuttle that goes to Waltham and another one that goes to Cambridge and Boston.\n\nCongratulations on getting accepted to Brandeis! Hope to see you here in the fall!",

It\u2019s painful as all fuck, but if you actually try it, you\u2019re gonna brag to everyone about how ripped your urethra is. \n\nFood is fucking garbage lmao, was bad in past years, but this year they\u2019ve underfunded dining sooo bad. Probably will be the same next year because they\u2019re overcrowding the class of 27 and the surplus money will likely be poured into the science depts., not dining :/",

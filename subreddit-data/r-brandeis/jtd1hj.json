Great night life in Boston plus restaurants, sox games, other shit. \n\nPro/Con: Not a top school academically, but definitely respected.  \n\nCon: Parties are sub par. (not to be shallow, but to be shallow, the student body is not the most attractive, hence the term \"Brandeis goggles\"). \n\nCon: Cold as balls in the winter.\n\nCon: No school spirit.\n\npm me if you have more questions.",

The academics were decent but after cross-registering at other Boston-area schools, I don't think they were better than what you generally find in the area. You could still get into a good graduate program if you were motivated enough.\n\nThe biggest problem was hygiene and maintenance. There were exposed pipes, letters falling off the sides of buildings and left like that for years, cobwebs, odors, moldy carpets. The food we had to eat from Sodexo through our mandatory $3k meal plans often had insects living in it. As in, you would scoop up the food and find flies. Yet there was always new construction going on somewhere.\n\nIt was obvious that our tuition wasn't being spent properly. It was the second most-expensive school in Mass. by the time I graduated. I would stop short of calling it a \"scam\", more of a \"rip off\" that we are still paying down with interest to this very day. We can only speculate as to why this is, especially if you dig deep enough on the internet, but either way I doubt anything has really changed.\n\nGo somewhere that's better managed.",

It's really disappointing to see the issue regarding the tuition and the lack of hygiene. The meal plans seem like an absolute horror.

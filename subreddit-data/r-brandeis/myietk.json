    "postText": "I am currently deciding between between Brandeis and the University of Rochester. I know the academics at both schools are top notch, but I also want to make sure that there are people at Brandeis who like to spend their Friday nights like me. I am really into board games in particular, and was wondering if there are other people at Brandeis who would spend their Friday evenings playing games like Settlers of Catan, Axis and Allies, etc. I don't think there are any clubs for board games specifically...",

I believe that every Saturday night they play board games but I'm not a member of the club myself. \n\nThere is also a game room in the Usdan Student center which used to have board games but I'm not sure what it's like this year.",

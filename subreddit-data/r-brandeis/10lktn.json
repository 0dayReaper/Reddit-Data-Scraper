    "postText": "Listen, I know there was a post about this a little while ago and I could probably just PM you guys about this if I had any questions. That's not really why I'm here. I guess the reason I'm posting this is because I go to Saint Anselm College in Manchester NH, and I hate it. I never wanted to go here; I got into Clark University, Brandeis University mid-year, and Saint Anselm, and Saint Anselm was always bottom of my list. My parents said I wasn't allowed to do the mid-year program, which absolutely sucks because Brandeis was my favorite target school (Tufts was my top choice, but was never really an obtainable goal). They also said I wasn't allowed to go to Clark because my girlfriend decided to go there. My parents decided that I wasn't allowed to go to the same school as her, so that left me with Saint Anselm. \n\nSaint Anselm was never **my** school, it was always the school everyone else wanted me to go to. I come from a strict Catholic family, and when our priest told me I would love it there, and that my Bishop would write me a recommendation, my parents made me apply. I never thought it would come to the point where I would have to go there so I didn't think anything of it, I just did what my parents asked me to do. But then I got forced into it.\n\nOnce I got here, all my fears were confirmed. This place is a nightmare. It's a school for wannabe jocks and all around assholes. The only kids that aren't drunken jerks are either slutty girls trying to *get* with the assholes, or anti social kids who stay cooped up in their rooms. See, the thing is, that might not be bad for some kids. But I come from Cape Elizabeth Maine, where people are like that anyway. The only kids that aren't like that where I come from are the ones that became my friends. problem is, I don't think Saint Anselm has people like that. The point is that even though it's only been a month, I haven't found my niche. I haven't found a real group of friends, and I'm just not happy. I don't see people around campus that look even remotely like me, and I just feel really alone.\n\nBut I think that might be different at Brandeis. I think you guys have a much more diverse group of students. You seem like a community that I can genuinely relate to and have a good time with. You have over two hundred different clubs and organizations! Saint Anselm has less than one hundred, and most of them are just clubs for the different majors (chem club, politics club, criminal justice club, etc.). There is not one improv group or comedy group or anything like that here. Hell, you guys even have a Pokemon club! I love Pokemon! Any place that has kids cool and open enough to get together and do what they love despite the fact that it isn't necessarily the most popular thing is the kind of place I want to spend the most important four years of my life. \n\nI know there's no way you guys can actually help me deal with all the stuff I'm going through right now, I guess I just need people to talk to me about how amazing Brandeis is. I'm afraid that i just have an idealized version of it in my head and that it isn't really as cool or accepting as I think it is. I don't want to waste my time only to go somewhere I still don't feel welcome. \n\nBut that's not all, I also have other problems. My family is by no means rich. My father is a high school teacher, and my mother is basically a secretary. In fact, my mom had to take up a second job because Saint Anselm gave me such a terrible financial aid package. Money is really the deciding factor here for my parents. Do you guys think (I know you can't tell for sure because you don't know my parents' income) that they would give me any significant financial aid? I've heard the transfer students don't get nearly as much money as everyone else, and that worries me a great deal. Right now I believe my bills are around $12,000 a year. Do you think I could get more than that from Brandeis? If not than I think my chances of transferring are pretty low.\n\nI'm sorry to dump this huge wall of text on your subreddit, I just don't know where else to go. I feel so terrible every day here and I could use some reassurance. If you can't help, that's fine. But if you can, it would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

            "comment": "I don't know all too much about the financial aid process or numbers, but if I remember correctly, the US News and World Report ranked us as #31 \"Best-Value School\" in the country (meaning that we have a high-ish percentage of kids receiving financial aid, and a high discount rate from said aid); according to that report ([here](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/best-value/page+2)), about 46% of students receive financial aid, and those that receive it have an average discount of 54%. Not including room and board, this figures out to about $24,000, much more than your current tuition at Saint Anslem. However, according to Brandeis' 2009-2010 Financial Aid Information Guide ([here](http://www.brandeis.edu/sfs/pdfs/09-10finaid-infoguide.pdf)), you should only be expected to pay 20% of your family's overall income; the rest of the cost should theoretically be covered by the school. If they offered you admittance, and don't offer you enough financial aid, I'm pretty sure you can push for more if that would mean that otherwise, you could not attend the school. (Check with someone more knowledgeable about the process than I before you actually do that; I don't honestly know how that might affect your chances for transfer.)\n\nI will say this, though (and I'm absolutely certain about this, even having only lived here for about a month so far): Brandeis is the most welcoming, diverse, engaged, dynamic, and lively community that I've had the opportunity to be a part of in my life so far. I have trouble explaining to people from back home how much I love the campus, my friends, almost all of my professors, the extracurriculars, etc., etc. If you're looking for a welcoming place, well... Brandeis is it. \n\n(I'll also say this: I'm Jewish, but I've met the Catholic chaplain, The Reverend Father Walter Cuenin, and he seems to be a fantastic person. (Actually, that's been my experience with every facet of the chaplaincy so far, but that's besides the point, haha.))\n\nBest of luck in figuring out how the rest of your year will work out! Feel free to PM me or reply here if you have any further questions. I can't promise that my answers will always be 100% accurate, but I'll do my best, haha.",

The financial stuff really does scare me, but there's n harm in at least applying and seeing what they give me. You have no idea how much I want to go to Brandeis right now haha. If I have any more questions I'll be sure to PM you. Thank you!",

It's an unusually friendly campus to the point of it being awkward sometimes, but what I've found the most interesting about Brandeis is that everyone is truly and genuinely interested in their studies. My sister is a transfer student at Brandeis, having transferred from a school with a population very similar to Saint Anselm and I graduated in May. PM me if you want to know more about my experience or her experience or about the school in general (nothing is off-limits).",

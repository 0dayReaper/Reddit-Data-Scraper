    "postText": "Hello! \n\nHoping to connect with folks who have experience with the MA Psych program (: \n\nI have a BS in Psych with a Bio minor from UMass Boston. Unfortunately I never got any real lab experience in undergrad but I have lots of relevant work experience. My ultimate goal is to go for a PhD in animal behavior, but realize that I need more research experience first. Brandeis is a short drive from my home and I'm very interested in the research going on there. \n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. Funding. How liberal are they with financial aid really? Any tips for landing an assistantship? Did you have to take out loans? \n\n2. Did you work in a lab? Particularly with Howard, Jadhav, or Gutsell? Tell me about it!\n\n3. Is my lack of research experience going to hurt my chances of getting accepted/getting aid?\n\nI'm feeling really lost in this process, so any and all reviews/tips/advice is much appreciated! (:",

I only knew a few psych MAs so I\u2019m not an expert, but here are my answers:\n\n1) Brandeis is pretty generous overall, but the aid given will depend on your specific circumstances.\n\n2) I knew people in Jadhav and Gutsell labs and they seemed pretty happy. I have to say though, those labs are like polar opposites.\n\n3) Doing research will help you but it\u2019s not a requirement. I don\u2019t think it will affect financial aid. At this point it\u2019s something out of your hands, and I wouldn\u2019t stress too much about it. The work experience matters a lot more.\n\nI hope this helps!",

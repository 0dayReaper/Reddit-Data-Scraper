    "postText": "Hi all, I'm a prospective student applying to Brandeis (C/O 2021/2025). I'm hoping to double major in history+NEJS and if I can, do a double minor in history of ideas and teaching education. While I might want to persue academia/being a professor and researcher, I may also want to go into being a high school teacher hence the minor. Would this course of study and the programs at Brandeis allow me to go to a good grad program? What do y'all think of the history/NEJS programs at Brandeis? Thank you!!!",

            "comment": "Hey! I\u2019m a senior majoring in NEJS who also plans to go into academia. I think your question about NEJS depends on what track you want. I\u2019ve done Bible and Ancient Near East and there is currently one faculty member who solely does that track and he\u2019s retiring at the end of the year. If you\u2019re doing Jewish studies, the program is big and robust. There are many teachers who focus on Jewish education, if that interests you. Also! David Katz, head of history of ideas, is an excellent, kooky professor",

Jewish history, either in like Mesopotamia, near east, that kinda era or modern times (specifically ~1800-present) and studying how people have viewed Jews and how Jews have developed as a culture, but again I'm not sure. Im also really interested in the history of thought and whatnot (hence history of ideas) and the history of education, so I'm really all over the place!",

There are a lotttt of faculty in terms of Jewish history 1800-present and we actually have one of the best professors in the world in that area (Prof. Jonathan Sarna), so if you\u2019re interested in that, he\u2019s your man. He\u2019s also definitely worth reaching out to if you want to hear more about him or the NEJS program, his classes have been a staple in the program for decades. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I wanted when I started Brandeis and one of the benefits of our liberal arts program is the ability to experiment a lot!! I\u2019ve taken all sorts of classes in so many different fields because of that, so that\u2019s definitely something you can do when you get here too",

I'd like to get some education in everything, so some near east some modern some middle ages, etc. I'm glad to hear it would offer me some good opportunities in research and outreach and field work though! That's something I'm very concerned with",

There are some endowed chairs that they are still filling on the near eastern end. They will definitely find a way to offer some ancient Near East courses, I\u2019d expect some from Professor Lynn Kaye (who also teaches Talmud and rabbinics) or from Professor Darlene Brooks-Hedstrom (who, besides Byzantine Christianity, also studies Egypt and the rest of the Near East and has done a lot of archeology there!). In my opinion, you\u2019d be able to get a well-rounded NEJS education, but for ease, I would probably do the Judaics track over the Bible and Ancient Near East track.",

I think you will probably have more than enough flexibility to take a fairly broad set of history classes in addition to NEJS if you want to. There are various distributional requirements within history (they've changed since I graduated, I think). One nice thing is that you can jump into an advanced history class right away if you want to (though it's a challenge!). I have peers that i'm in touch with who also did history currently pursuing PhDs in history, a good number in law school or beginning their careers as lawyers, and some teaching history at various levels. Lots of really smart people going impressive places and doing important work",

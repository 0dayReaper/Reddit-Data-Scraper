    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a student currently in an AP Research class in which we are set to do a project and write a research paper about what we found. I am hoping for a survey of about 300 students from various colleges/universities in Massachusetts. For my project, I will look at mental health, academics, and race. The survey will be strictly anonymous and does not ask participants for their names, emails, or any other questions that will identify them personally. This project will also not be posted or published.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out in the comments.\n\nHere is the attached link for my survey:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecK19witeDzd7JaqOkBh0hvHcarWcOmviUywOEmwOlEuRyjg/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecK19witeDzd7JaqOkBh0hvHcarWcOmviUywOEmwOlEuRyjg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",

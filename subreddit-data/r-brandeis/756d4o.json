    "postText": "Greetings, I am a high school senior from Louisiana that visited Brandies in April. I really liked the school, impressed by the facilities, as well as further research clued me into a number of clubs and organizations that I would love to join should I attend. I would love to hear opinions on the school, or general information about your experience, positive and negative. I will most likely be applying either way. Thanks for reading, and have a great day.",

I'm a physics major in my senior year and so far the process has been pretty smooth. The faculty here are, for the most part, responsive and respectful of their students. On top of that, there is almost a club for anything you might want to do (Rock Climbing, Nerf gun stuff, Volleyball, Aviation, etc.) and whatever isn't here you can help create. Best of luck in your college decision process.",

            "comment": "Graduated in 17. It really depends on your major. There are certain majors that I'd recommend and others I'd say never. For instance NEJS is excellent but computer science is abysmal. Cost is another factor with constant tuition hikes it will likely be 70k/year total by the time you graduate (it's already 63k now). Campus is also very social justice warrior heavy so if you are a conservative/libertarian/not left   of center you will likely be ostracized to a certain degree. Despite lacking real sports, clubs and activities are very good and always welcoming. Not much partying (except on Purim). Brandeis is also somewhat money grubbing so you will lose money on superfluous housing charges and be forced to purchase a mandatory meal plan as long as you live in campus housing (which for many is all four years). On the otherhand  you do meet a lot of interesting and passionate people who will be good for your network later on. \n\nAltogether some positives and some negatives. So the decision really comes down to you and what you want. Also don't believe the tour guides/representatives they purposefully select the most bubbly overly cheerful people for those jobs and then pay them to gloss over all the bad parts.",

You just have to pick the right classes, find the professors that you jive with, and actually work hard. You can't just take BS electives or or independent studies and expect to learn anything. \n\n",

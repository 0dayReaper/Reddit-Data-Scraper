Every person in that picture holds the same beliefs, shares the same life experiences, has the same goals, and brings the exact same perspectives in all areas of their lives.\n\n...Except that's completely untrue, and I know from experience because some of my friends are in that picture.  Diversity is not simply gathering people with different skin colors.  Let's face it, we're not a particularly racially diverse campus, but anyone who automatically assumes that this picture doesn't show a diverse group of people doesn't really understand why diversity is important.  Would you rather they have found a black kid who happened to be walking around campus and pulled him in just to be the \"token minority\"?",

    "postText": "Hey Guys, \n\nThank you to the people who have replied to my two previous posts and I have some more questions which I hope can be answered here!\n\n1.\tHow does the mailroom system work for people living on campus? I saw that on the website there is a self service kiosks and I wanted to know if that\u2019s just for letter mails or also for packages from like Amazon, etc.\n\n\n2.\t What\u2019s the chance of me getting a single room in freshman year during this housing crisis I am seeing?\n\nThanks in advance for your response.",

You\u2019ll get an email whenever a package is ready to be picked up. \n\n2. unlikely unless you get a doctors note",

            "comment": "Getting a single is pretty unlikely, partly because freshman halls aren\u2019t designed with many single rooms so you\u2019d need a double with no roommate for that to happen. Beyond that the only way to be guaranteed one is with housing accommodations for some medical or religious issue but you\u2019d need documentation for that. Mail is pretty straightforward and super easy, just as one of the other comments described.",

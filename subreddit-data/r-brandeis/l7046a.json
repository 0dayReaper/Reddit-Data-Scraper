Passionate about making a difference?***\n\nSchool for a Village (S4V) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to bridge the gap in STEM education for underserved secondary schools around the world through need-specific, targeted support.\n\n**Projects:** We built 3 science labs in Bahjoi, India, enabling &gt;1,000 students to complete the state-mandated curriculum for the first time. We have partnered with Choosito!, an NSF-funded digital library, to bring needed resources to students in Nanyuki, Kenya. Visit [school4village.org/projects/](http://school4village.org/projects/) to learn more!\n\nNone of this would be possible without our chapters and student ambassadors that work to promote advocacy and awareness for S4V. Learn more about these roles here: [school4village.org/join-us/](http://school4village.org/join-us/).\n\n***LEADERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:***\n\n* **S4V chapter leaders** initiate a *local chapter organization* at their universities/high schools. *Apply here!* [https://forms.gle/2B1jPpRukVSWW7i88](https://forms.gle/2B1jPpRukVSWW7i88)\n* **S4V student ambassadors** work *individually* to promote awareness for S4V. *Apply here!* [https://forms.gle/qs4FfrhU7A7YuxPv8](https://forms.gle/qs4FfrhU7A7YuxPv8)\n\nI've attached a flyer with information about how interested students can get started. Please feel free to message me if you are interested or have any questions. We look forward to hearing from you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ncxkcagsf3e61.jpg?width=4857&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b20b9d5ff3590610c17dc8f948aee66027a3d0d2",

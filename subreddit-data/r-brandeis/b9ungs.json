    "postText": "A friend of mine started a Discord server for Boston area college students to interact, meet up, talk about school and events, etc. We've been going strong for a few months now and I figured I'd drop a link off now that the class of 2023 is starting to make decisions about where they want to go to college. Join and invite your friends who go to college in Boston!\n\nInvite link: [https://discord.gg/RR5X9FS](https://discord.gg/RR5X9FS)",

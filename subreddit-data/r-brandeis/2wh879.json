    "postText": "Hi everyone! The title is pretty self-explanatory...I was just accepted into Brandeis's MA program for English Literature. Most of what's on here seems to be from the perspective of an undergraduate. What's it like at Brandeis as a grad student? I'd love to make my way out to Boston often, is that feasible? Do you feel like you get to meet new people and live decent social lives?\n\nThank you!",

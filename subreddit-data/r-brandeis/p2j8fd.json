The course evaluations for BIOL 15B weren't too good, so I'm a bit worried...\n\nAlso, is there any advantage to taking BIOL 15B in the fall?",

If you don't understand something from lecture, reach out to your TA in advance of recitation and ask them to touch on it - obviously it will vary from TA to TA but usually they appreciate the heads up on topics the class is struggling with.",

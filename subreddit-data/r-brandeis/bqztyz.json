You could get away with bedding, a computer, some sort of Cafe brewer and maybe space heater /fan. Microwave/minifridge between you and your roommate never goes amiss but isn't necessary.",

            "comment": "I agree just bring the basics and things that would make your feel comfortable. Also, what you bring slightly depends on where you live. I lived in the dorm above the laundry room my freshman year, so during the start of the semester, I was really hot and only wanted light sheets, not heavy bedding. However, this past semester, I lived in east and froze during the winter (even bought an electric heating blanket). I would also reach out to your roommates to coordinate communal items. For example, each dorm only needs one printer, one set of cleaning supplies, one fridge/microwave etc, so I would get in contact with them to see who should bring what, or if they prefer to bring their own stuff.\n\nLastly, you can ship things to Brandeis before move in (link with instructions below). Also, you can contact the mail room if you have a unique shipping situation or have any questions  [mailcenter@brandeis.edu](https://www.brandeis.edu/services/mail/mailcenter@brandeis.edu)/(781) 736-4236 or (781) 736-4233. We recently switched mailing companies to Swiss Post, and the employees are so helpful and nice.\n\n[https://www.brandeis.edu/orientation/getready/shipping-info.html](https://www.brandeis.edu/orientation/getready/shipping-info.html)",

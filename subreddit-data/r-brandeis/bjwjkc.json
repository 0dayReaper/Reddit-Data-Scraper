If you want to go into banking or finance or quant for that matter, math major is the way to go with a business minor/major. \n\nThe career center does not help with finance related positions as much, and I would have liked to know how important networking is. If anyone has any interest in investment banking, applications and networking need to be done over a year in advance. The summer analyst positions for 2020 are already filled in some bulge bracket banks. \n\nI will walk away from here with a good job, but it\u2019s because I worked my absolute ass off to catch up and weasel my way into places that I probably didn\u2019t deserve to be in because of how hard I networked. People much smarter than I am have no idea what they want to do until it\u2019s too late and they are pigeonholed into sales from their lack of internship experience and networking. \n\nAlso, I would have probably transferred to a target after my first year.",

It is essential to get internships as often as you can (in the summer and during the semesters) to help yourself find a job after graduation. Hiatt doesn't hold career fairs (until its much too late) and mostly just tell you to network with people but don't give you opportunities to do that.",

They are such great resources and most of them are really nice people! Also, if you intend on doing the MS/BS combined degree in biochem, your research mentor and biochem advisor have to approve your thesis. Thus, I suggest you start talking to your professors as frequently and as often as you can, so you can find a good research mentor and have your project approved.",

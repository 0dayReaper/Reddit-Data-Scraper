    "postText": "If it comes down to that, how easy will it be for me to persuade another student to drive me to the nearest asian mart? \n\nI am from NC, just got accepted into Brandeis and I really want to go. But if I do go, I will likely get sick at the sight of my dwindling bank account and my inability to stomach excessive quantities heavier foods (I was unable to eat and was very constipated after I went to Upenn for a summer camp). The journey to the nearest asian markets -- Well come or Hong Kong -- requires tolerating long transit times -- more than 1 hour -- and that's pretty inconvenient. I could do homework on the transit, but it's rather difficult carrying a bag full of groceries, chilli oil, and soy sauce while trying to flip through a textbook. \n\nHow many people in Brandeis have cars? Also, would they be willing to trade meals for transportation? Thank you very much.",

Most of your staff are commuting at least that far daily. (Source: Brandeis grad who also worked there for years)",

There's a shared full fridge and freezer, but it's shared with a few hundred people and not somewhere where you should plan to keep anything.   \n\n\nThe microfridge is something like this: [https://www.grainger.com/product/787CW9?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:4P7A1P:20501231&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K10RD14RJbY3GfcKeTQxFKZGyzU49Vu3w5h6Q4FK0O2L1O2cyDi3CxoCyhcQAvD\\_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.grainger.com/product/787CW9?gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2295:4P7A1P:20501231&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K10RD14RJbY3GfcKeTQxFKZGyzU49Vu3w5h6Q4FK0O2L1O2cyDi3CxoCyhcQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) These are not provided to you, but is something you and your roommate(s) can rent if one of you doesn't choose to buy one. These are pretty standard no matter what college you choose. Keep in mind you could have two roommates, so you'd be sharing this space with 1-2 people and should plan accordingly.   \n\n\nKeep in mind you are only allowed a microwave in a dorm room. Rice cookers, instant pots, crock pots, hot plates, electric kettles, etc. aren't allowed in the dorms (true at Brandeis, but also just about any other dorm at any other college). You can use them in common spaces, but keep in mind you have very limited storage space in dorm rooms.   \n\n\nIn general, no matter what college you choose, you shouldn't really plan to do much cooking while living in dorms. It's just not realistic given the space you have available and what you are allowed to have in your dorm room.",

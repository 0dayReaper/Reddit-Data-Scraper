Back then it seemed like a lot of people who weren't even students (or if they were they didn't get passes) parked there too (this  was 2016-2017 btw). In general the cops in order of importance seemed to be:  science building lot &gt; lot by Usdan &gt; Admissions &gt;  North Lot &gt; East Lot &gt; Theater &gt; grad.",

You can take their opinion with a grain of salt because both are presumably tenured (as full-time, experienced professors), which is a great deal and doesn't make management sense (that's a whole other argument)\n\nIt's not being well-received from the alumni community that has been commenting on the facebook links that I've seen.  Most of us owe tens of thousands of dollars to the school so take that into account, but the most damning paragraph (IMO) is:\n\n&gt; Rising administrative expenses are one reason that the average cost of higher education has soared 70 percent during the past decade \u2014 twice the rate of inflation \u2014 and elite schools such as Brandeis now charge nearly $60,000 a year or more for tuition, room, and board. The number of college administrative jobs has increased 57 percent during 10 years while pay for university presidents has ballooned, with dozens of college leaders receiving at least $1 million a year. \n\nThat's the part that objectively burns...microcosm of how big business works in the U-S-A and higher ed is definitely big business (even/especially) at Brandeis",

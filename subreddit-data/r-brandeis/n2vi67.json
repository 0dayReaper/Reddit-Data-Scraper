    "postText": "Honestly, outside of academics I think this school is an absolute joke. With how expensive tuition is, it's criminal how everything relating to student life on this campus is either incredibly inconvenient or just straight up non-functional. I'll break it up into multiple sections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dorms:** \n\nThe rooms themselves aren't a problem. It's the laundry. About half the time I wash my clothes, the washer leaves the clothes absolutely soaked and I have to wring out my clothes into the drain in the laundry room. Even then it takes about 3 or 4 dryer to cycles to actually dry my clothes. It's a toss up whether it'll take the 1.5 hours to do laundry like it should or like 4 hours. It's not even like it's one machine that does it. Sometimes I've broken up my laundry into two separate loads and used the same machine. The first one will come out fine and then the second one is drenched. Sometimes I'll try a different machine and it'll still soak my clothes. It's a joke. Minor note, but I live in East and like to have my window open for a breeze and fresh air. Why is there some loud noise from construction or something like a leaf blower every morning??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Dining:**\n\nThe food was fine my freshman year, but after it just becomes boring. Growing up in an Asian household, I just want something simple like white rice and some type of meat. You'd think that with Asians being the second largest demographic that this school would try to maybe cater to them in the dining halls, but nope. Their attempt at Asian food is dropping anything in teriyaki sauce or making lo mein with the coldest and hardest noodles I've ever eaten in my life. Hell, even the rice is like that too. There's very limited options when it comes to eating actual edible food. When the pandemic hit, dining became even more of a joke. Those take out containers you get are so small you get very little food with them. You can't go back for seconds which is extremely inconvenient. The Bite app almost takes the spot for the worst app I've ever downloaded in my life. So many nights I've tried to order SubConnect with my meal swipes and it will reject my payment, forcing me to use points. This has been occurring all semester long. I've also had issues with the Dunkin Donuts or Stein not making my order because something went wrong where the ticket never got printed or something, making me wait longer for my food. Also, Upper Usdan won't take orders after 10:30 pm on weekdays, even though it says they close at 11. If that's the case, then say you close at 11. Don't bait me into making plans to do work until 10:30 then grab food if I'm not gonna be able to eat. The dining halls also close at 8 or 9, which is very early and hard to plan around if you have late classes. Also, why does Lower Usdan close during the weekends? There's no reason and just makes getting something as basic and necessary like getting food such as hassle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Covid Restrictions**:\n\nThe Covid Passport is the most inconvenient thing I have ever seen. You have to show a green passport everywhere you go, and really, why even check? Let's say somehow you answer the daily health assessment such that you'd get a red passport. What's stopping someone from just lying to get a green one? It doesn't actually do anything to stop the spread of Covid on campus. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR this school is a joke and it should be illegal for basics like food and laundry to be this inconvenient or non-functional.",

The academics are very good, the people are great, the club scene is great, and the school is handling covid excellently in my opinion (are we really going to be angry at 0.03% test positivity rate? I don't think so). Sure, we don't have the best dorms and food, but the food isn't bad and the dorms are serviceable. We truly do have so many research opportunities and resources for students. You can get your money's worth here, imo.\n\nOne thing that can get tiresome about this school is how much its students criticize it. Some of it is natural and good and progresses things and I'm sure helps the school become better. Some of it is just people being mad, idk. If you come here and find yourself in the situation of OP, transfer! Maybe the school isn't for you. I can just speak to my own experiences when I say that there's a lot to like here, and I don't think it's the best to pick colleges based on dorms and food. Pick a college with a culture that fits you and academics that challenge and help you. You'll survive eating a little bit worse than good and in not so great housing. People have for a long time. Just find some good friends and interesting classes and you'll have a good time.",

            "comment": "Hello, so I attended Brandeis for about a year and half ago. Since then, I transferred. I'll try my best to give a fair and balance perspective. The problems you stated can be seen in other universities.  Brandeis is the ideal school for you if you want a traditional college experience with a close proximity to other prestigious universities in the Boston Area as well as a quiet campus. Prior to the pandemic, I did enjoy going to other universities for parties, especially Harvard and MIT. However, at the same time, the quiet campus feeling wasn't appealing to me because I prefer having a city feeling, plus it's difficult to make any friends because, in my experience, a lot of people are socially awkward and cliquey. I believe that, I think in 2022, there would be parties (again, I'm not sure). The academics is stellar as they offer an avenue of what you want to study. When I entered Brandeis, I thought I was going to be a pre-med, majoring in neuroscience. But, as soon as I took one sociology class, I immediately changed my mind. That being said, it also led me to decide to transfer because Brandeis didn't offer any subjects I am interested in like social work. A major critique I have with the university is how it values \"social justice\" which is, in my opinion, hypocritical as the university underpays its student workers  as well as problems with campus policing and on campus housing.",

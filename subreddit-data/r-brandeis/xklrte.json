The 70 picks up on Main street behind the neighborhood behind Rabb (you can cut through a gate behind Rabb so its not that far of a walk). It goes to Central Square where you can transfer to the red line. The 553 picks up on South Street, right outside of campus and goes to Newton where you can transfer to the 504 (or another bus, depending on where exactly you're going).  Definitely more schlep than an Uber, the Boston shuttle or the commuter rail, but also the least expensive option and probably has more time options than the commuter rail. On days the Boston shuttle didn't run, these were my favorite ways to get downtown because I was very cheap when I was an undergrad.",

            "comment": "I was not a grad student in comp sci, I was at Heller. I believe making friends and getting involved as a grad student is relatively easy. A lot of grad students hang out in the grad room on campus, so it\u2019s relatively easy to get to know people in other grad programs. Also I joined the black graduate student association which introduced me to a other grad students at Brandeis.",

Overall I believe going there helped me to be more competitive in the academic market and the job market, however there are some serious diversity issues on campus. I spent a lot of time in diversity offices reporting professors and their actions, which I believe negatively impacted impacted my time there. But I believe that those issues are getting better, and that the minorities (and higher-level staff) on campus are advocating for a better experience. I would recommend going to Brandeis because of the doors it opens, but be prepared for the possible micro-aggressions and grad school culture clashes that could happen.",

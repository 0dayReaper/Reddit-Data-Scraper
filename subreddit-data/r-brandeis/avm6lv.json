It's completely possible to choice three easy of your choice classes and not get a ton out of it. But it's worth noting that a lot of the \"cool\" classes have prerecs that might be hard to fill. \n\nAlternatively Brandeis has both the BS and BA major tracks for CS. The BA have less classes. \nFeel free to dm with specific questions. ",

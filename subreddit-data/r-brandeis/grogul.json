    "postText": "Incoming Freshman, sorry if this question is stupid. So I've looked on the page on the website and they have a whole page with a paragraph on each requirement, but everything's really wordy and I'm confused the exact number of required classes. I know some can be fulfilled while also getting a major. Let's say I was doing no major, how many general ed required classes are there total? Also what exactly was the change for 2019 students and onward, that part was confusing.\n\nI'm just trying to block everything out like this: If I have 32 classes I take total for the 4 years, and 14 of those are devoted to my CS major, how many would be devoted to my required classes, so I can figure out how many I have leftover. This would influence whether I go for another major or not, if it's too damn hard then I won't. Cause there's no way I'm taking more than 4 classes a semester",

Additionally there is great benefit in the liberal arts ethos we see here, it is very important to be a well rounded, well educated person. I have really had the way I think about the world changed by some of the classes I've taken outside my major that fulfill the requirements, and I am thankful for how it has improved both me as a person and my critical thinking skills. There are a shitload of tech people being trained every year across the globe, but few of them will have the critical thinking and writing skills that you will have after this, which is a great asset to employers.\n\nSince you already know your major from day one, you will have plenty of space for these other classes just by taking 4 a semester. I changed my major halfway through and am still able to get everything, strictly only taking 4 classes a semester.",

    "postText": " Hi all!\n\nFormer Brandeis Alum here.  This is somewhat self-promotion, but it's for a good cause (I\u2019m not profiting from this) and we need volunteers, so I thought I'd post it anyway.  I built a website that allows people who want to volunteer/work to fight coronavirus and connect with those that need help, be they hospitals, research labs, or even households. People sign up, and, in a couple of days, those that need volunteers can put in their location and we will provide them with a list of people nearby. Anyone in the US can sign up, but we are focusing on Boston (and Seattle). If you are interested in helping, please volunteer, like or share.\n\nWebsite:[ https://endcovid.org/volunteers/](https://endcovid.org/volunteers/)\n\nSidenote: As someone who has worked in industry and is now getting a Phd, I'm happy to help others looking for jobs.  Just DM me.",

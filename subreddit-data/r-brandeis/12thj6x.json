Like some official volunteering activities might be more difficult to easily find in some East asian countries or they might give more or less leeway for the english SAT (idk). I feel a bit humbled by your achievements, I really want some studying tips from you lol.",

Thanks and don\u2019t be\ud83d\ude05I just like studying math so I don\u2019t bother spending 2 hours a day 3 to 4 times a week doing exercises. I kind of hate physics but had to take it because u can\u2019t pick math without physics. Besides I just used khan academy during the summer to prepare for the English test (the math is really easy compared to what we\u2019re doing). I\u2019m Tunisian btw",

My suggestion would be to write your supplemental essay on why you want to attend Brandeis, and talk about how you have a lot of different passions and want to explore a bunch of them in a fun, free, noncompetitive environment with a bunch of people who are genuinely passionate about what they're doing. Brandeis likes funky people who are smart and follow the things they're passionate about.",

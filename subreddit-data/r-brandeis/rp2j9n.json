I\u2019d like to think that my child is a sophisticated citizen of the world, but at the same time can\u2019t deny that he has the dietary habits of a toddler. Which leads me to my question\u2014at Brandeis, how are the quality and availability of pizza and chicken tenders? TIA**",

            "comment": "I graduated a couple years ago and wings were served on Fridays but chicken tenders were rarely served. The Stein which is a campus bar had solid chicken tenders that were used with points or loaded with money dining cards or cash. \n\nFood is overall okay from where I left campus, but there are options like the sandwich shop that have crispy chicken wraps and sandwiches which are good enough. \n\nOverall, the food was not good compared to my friends that went to BU and BC, but there are wonderful Delis in the area and such. Maybe the quality has increased and maybe they upgraded from Sodexo or the lowest tier of food, but I doubt it.",

Oftentimes they'll also have chicken tenders - I see them a couple times a week. They're all good quality food. No need to worry!",

I'm waiting on Cornell.\n\n\nEDIT: I got into Cornell and decided to go there. Thanks everyone for your help.",

If you work for the justice, the hoot also qualifies (that is a joke). There is Boris' Kitchen for sketch comedy, and at least 4 improv troupes as well, at least when I was there. I had a total blast at Brandeis, it's super fun, the people are awesome, there's tons to do on campus, and it's really easy to get into Boston for a night out. Would go again 10/10. \n\nEdit: the frisbee team is also really prominent and cool. ",

            "comment": "Hey! I'm a junior at Brandeis, majoring in CS and minoring in physics. I'm also a computer science undergraduate department representative at Brandeis, basically I just talk to people in the major and people thinking about the major and plan events and stuff. I have a lot of feelings about the CS program (some good, some bad). Basically, I think the CS program is really good if you want to go into computational linguistics or systems. For other stuff, it's kind of lacking, but it's still a good program, just not *amazing*. If you're interested in Brandeis because of the social justice atmosphere and how easy it is to take other classes to expand your worldview, then definitely go here. But don't choose Brandeis just for the CS program. One good thing I should mention is that because the program is relatively small (big for Brandeis, small for other schools), you really get to know the professors. So that's fun, and obviously comes with perks.\n\nOne nice thing is that we recently opened a MakerLab a few years ago. It went from absolutely nothing to this great maker space with a lot of tools and resources, everyone is always surprised and excited when they learn about it because it's really unusual for such a small school to have that good of a maker space. --shameless plug-- We also have a hackathon (Codestellation) that is great and everyone should go to. The theme is learning, teamwork, and inclusivity, so it's very Brandeis. Oh, and if you come here, join BITMAP, the CS club. We need new members because all of our board members are graduating in the next two years.\n\nAlso, like someone mentioned, gravity is the satire magazine. It's pretty good, but definitely more fun to write for than read. I hung out at their meetings a few times and it's a good time.\n\nBut yeah feel free to PM me about CS or Brandeis or whatever.\n",

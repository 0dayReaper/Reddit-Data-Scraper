            "comment": "Depends on the amount of money you have to pay to be honest. I like Brandeis, the teachers and education are top notch and they all seem like they really care and love their job which is very important. There is definitely room for improvement, the food can be way better (it\u2019s not too bad or be honest, sometimes I enjoy it, but it\u2019s also not gourmet or good). The campus is really small, and I think this is a plus because it\u2019s so easy to get everywhere. The shuttles are really easy to get around places. Waltham in general is really nice, and Boston is really cool and beautiful. \nI can\u2019t really say much about UCLA because I\u2019ve never really researched much about them, from the very start I always wanted to go to a small liberal arts school. So ask yourself, what do you want? Do you see yourself in a very small community of smart people, or a huge school with smart people. I think you can\u2019t really go wrong with either, but California is really really nice so that\u2019s a plus.",

            "comment": "I am from LA and went to Brandeis in 2013. It depends on what you're looking for really. If you want the better academics you'd probably want to go to UCLA. If you're set on majoring in anything specific you'll probably want UCLA too. Same if you are interested in frats or parties. If you're very interested in doing a double major Brandeis would be good. \n\n The biggest reason I'm glad I went to Brandeis was that it was pretty small which meant it was able to make friends easily, classes almost never filled up, and getting involved with clubs / student research was pretty chill. The UCs more or less treat you like a cog in the machine, which is ok with some people and not with others. I majored in CS and music, and got an internship/job at Google which is probably as good as I could have hoped for from any school, but I definitely had to put in my own work to do it. This is just my experience keep in mind, others may have different experiences. \n\nI met my gf at Brandeis and she's going to UCLA now for a PhD so I can ask her any specific questions if you'd like :)\n\nBy the way this reddit is not very active at all, I'm not really sure what the kids use nowadays lol. Probably discord.",

CS professors are all pretty nice, different people are fan favorites depending on your personality and what you're looking for. My favorite professor was a lot of people's least favorite, and vice versa. \n\nMy music professors were all pretty nice too, it's a small department so you can get to know everyone well. The music minor is pretty easy too.",

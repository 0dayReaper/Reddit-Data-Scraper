    "postText": "Upcoming HS Junior here. I've recently decided that I would like to go to Brandeis after HS and major in psychology. However, before I make final decisions next year, I would like to know would you consider the psych program to be focused more on social psych or neuroscience as I am planning to become a therapist and social psych would better fit that. \n\nAlso, how tough is the workload? Would you consider it to be an easy or hard major?\n\nThank you and good luck with your classes!",

Most consider the major to be pretty easy both at Brandeis and at most places, but by doing research and taking more neuro-focused courses you can make the path more rigorous. I know more than a few people who went on to top-ten graduate schools with a Brandeis psych major.",

    "postText": "I am a rising junior and I just got my housing number. My number is 1283 and I was initially very excited because I wanted to pull some of my friends in to get a Ridgewood suite, but I was recently told that it is unlikely that I even could get a ridge with 1283. Does anyone have experience with trying to get a ridge with a similar number?",

Assuming that in every group of 4 and 6, only one person has a lower number then yours, you won't make it- you'd need a number 1262 or below to guarantee it. \n\nThat's assuming everyone in front of you chooses a ridge though and that only one person in a group has a good nunber- but there's always a couple that chose not to go ridge. So it'll be really close if you are able to snag one, but be ready if ya can't.",

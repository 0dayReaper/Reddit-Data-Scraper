I\u2019ve met peers who have done completely different things though. Brandeis also accounts for what you have the resources to do, for example if your school doesn\u2019t have a robotics team they won\u2019t expect you to have done that. If you need to have a large commitment to your family then they understand that you can\u2019t be on your school\u2019s varsity sports team, etc.",

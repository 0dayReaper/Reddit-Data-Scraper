    "postText": "I'm trying to get my hands on CDs for the a cappella group \"Up the Octave\".  I want the entire discography, but in particular, I really want the album \"Clandestina\".  \n\nI've tried contacting them via the email address on their website (which appears to be out-of-date), but I get no response.  \n\nI'm hoping that someone here could put me in touch with someone who could help me out.  \n\nThanks!",

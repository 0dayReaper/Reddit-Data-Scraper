Is it easy to get into Boston from Brandeis, and is there a surrounding area that you can hang out in right outside campus, like Tufts has with Davis square?",

In general, Waltham is not your typical \"college town\", so outside of Moody street there's not much else. The T commuter line to Boston has a stop right next to campus, which is nice if you're trying to get to Boston.",

It is not correct to say that it is convenient to get to Boston/Cambridge from Brandeis by public transport. There is the Brandeis Boston-Cambridge shuttle, that is convenient but only runs from campus to Boston/Cambridge on the evenings from Thursday to Sunday.",

So, Brandeis is not \"in Boston\" either \"technically\" or even figuratively.  It's in a residential area of Waltham with a few small businesses around it, but it doesn't have a \"town around it\" in the sense that I think you mean. That being said, the main business district of Waltham is about a 15 minute walk from campus, so it's not too bad. There is also a commuter rail stop on the edge of campus that can take you into Boston if that's what you're seeking.",

Waltham is a very nice city with good restaurants and an independent movie theater. When I was at Brandeis (over a decade ago) I found it very easy to get in and out of Boston / Cambridge between the commuter rail (less than 20 minutes to Cambridge), the MBTA bus that picked up next to campus and went to south station, the other MBTA bus that picked up near Moody St and went into Cambridge, and the Brandeis shuttle busses that went into Boston / Cambridge every 90 minutes or so on weekends. You can also take uber / cabs to the nearest T station (Riverside / Alewife).\n\nSo you've got a lot of options, even though the school is not right on the T.",

If you wanna go into actual boston you can take the T or the more popular option is the branvan that takes you into Boston and that can take you back on campus from Boston (branvan schedule under useful links in this sub)",

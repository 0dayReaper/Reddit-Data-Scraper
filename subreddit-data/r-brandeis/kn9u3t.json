Your SAT score is only slightly below the 50th percentile, which means it shouldn\u00b4t count points against you since it is close to their average accepted student, and you have a good distribution. But if you feel proud of that paper, got a good grade on it, and feel that the additional letter of recommendation will add value to your application, that would also be an option for you.",

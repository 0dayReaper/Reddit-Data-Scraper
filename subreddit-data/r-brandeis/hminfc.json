                            "comment": "Something that I think is important to mention here is that while the admin wants to permit in-person classes, I anticipate that in practice, nearly all classes will be online, which will make it difficult for international students who end up with a roster of just online classes.\n\nI'll explain: this situation has already played out at my undergrad institution, and while their official university policy over there is that \"any class can be in-person\", students on their subreddit are reporting that almost all the in-person classes they registered for are being converted to online. This is because ***for*** ***the vast majority of classes, there is not enough classroom space to stay under the required student density cap for social distancing.*** So professors there have been planning and offering in-person classes, but **when professors try to schedule classrooms with the registrar, they're being denied a classroom because there are no classrooms available that are large enough to accommodate the class while staying under the university's classroom density requirements.** Just to be clear, I don't know if this is the situation at Brandeis right now, but it would make sense to me that this will happen given that our supply of classrooms is limited. \n\nIf you're enrolled in classes at Brandeis this Fall, ESPECIALLY if you're an international student, you should email ALL of your professors TODAY and verify if they anticipate having a classroom. Furthermore, if the student union is having a town hall, ATTEND IT (I know my department's graduate student union is having one today).",

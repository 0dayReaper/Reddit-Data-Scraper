            "comment": "My usual advice is take honors if you like chemistry. Honors is better, more work, smaller, and harder. Med schools don\u2019t care which one you take if that helps. Either way gen chem is the hardest course on the premed track. I\u2019d say 20-30% drop each year, mostly because they decide they\u2019d rather go drinking with friends than worry about med school.",

            "comment": "Hello I just finished taking honors chem for both semesters. Much is expected of your knowledge walking into class, neither the fall or spring semester profs are easy, the material is very very abstract the first semester with a huge amount of emphasis placed on quantum mechanics (fair amount of Calc concepts are needed, physics is useful but not necessary). That being said, I do think this class was an important part of my college experience as it deflated my swollen high school ego and most of all taught me how much I didn\u2019t know, and how huge the legacy of science is. Bottom line is take Gen Chem if you want the req, take honors if you want an experience that will make you work for your successes. Make no mistake it is very easy to fail in honors, I let my pride get in the way of learning do not make that mistake no matter which class you end up taking.\n\nPoint of reference\nI had a stem concentration in high school and had B+ or higher in every science class I took. I had two years of high school chem under my belt and to be perfectly honest no of these things matter as they show past performance not current work ethic or study skills.\n\nEdit: sorry for word wall dm me if you need more help",

            "comment": "Professors may have changed so take my view with a grain of salt.\n\nGo honors. TBH I think it'll be easier (and not really that difficult overall, if that is any comfort for you).\n\nFirst semester was no problem as someone whose only chem was a pre-AP chemistry class I took in 10th grade. Mostly just applying algebra with some calculus sprinkled in to chem concepts you definitely already know well if you took AP, but the profs walked us through it.\n\nSecond semester is more calculus-heavy, but the prof (usually Schmidt-Rohr I believe) is really teaching-focused and good (though really boring). The first week may feel intimidating with maths, but he really holds your hand through the course material, and the math is still basically algebra just with some calculus-based explanations of concepts.\n\nWhy honors over gen chem? Workload seems chiller overall. HW was all completion and exams both semesters were basically HW questions with 1 or 2 new problems. Basically, do your work (which is not that much) and you'll get an A ez.\n\nIn contrast, my roommate took gen chem and their exams looked annoying AF and people really struggled (freshman transition probable culprit but still people seemed to love/hate Novak, assuming she is still the prof).\n\nLab sorta sucks for both (tip: know lab handbook front and back and you'll do great on exams), so that shouldn't factor in.\n\nJust be confident and don't be fearful of 'notorious' classes (orgo, bchm, etc.), the profs want you to succeed. Do your work and you'll do great regardless of your choice.\n\nAlso, a lot of the honors kids seemed to be the high-achieving pre-meds (honors theses, 4-yr BS/MS, going to the fancy med schools, yada-yada), so doing honors may push you and help you with those ambitions by virtue of mingling with those folks if you decide to stick with it.\n\nThere were no curves though, so don't worry about competing with those smarty-pants.\n\nGL. This year seems like it'll be a shitfest, so stay focused.",

I was also a transfer students and although I transferred after graduating community college I was admitted as a sophmore and a half lol. I ended up doing the full 2 and a half years but I'm sure you can graduate sooner if you take more credits to fill in",

You\u2019d probably need to take some summer courses for one or two semesters, which is also doable, but again only with careful planning.",

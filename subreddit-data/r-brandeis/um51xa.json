    "postText": "Hi y'all, \n\nI'm a new acceptance to Brandeis ('26), but after visitng and talking with a few of the students, I heard a rumor about a so-called 'Brandeis Sexer'. Apparently they're a member of the class of 2025, and have been going around 'sexing' everyone in their class. They've had sex with many individuals at this point, and apparently it is their mission to 'sex Brandeis'??? Is this a real phenomenon, because if so I might want to defer my application until this 'sexer' is gone. Is the 'Brandeis Sexer' a real part of Brandeis culture? I'm mildly concerned that this would have a lot of effects on the community at large and am just hoping that said 'sexer' does not actually exist.",

I don\u2019t know how many students a few is, but this just sounds like something a college kid or two or three might say just for shits and giggles. No there isn\u2019t a person going around having sexual intercourse or sexting the 2,800 student body. I mean this nicely and sincerely when I say try to work on your telling if a story is true or complete BS skills because if you read your post back it sounds like an April fools post. On a more serious note, Brandeis\u2019s culture is no different than any other colleges to my knowledge. Please don\u2019t defer your acceptance simply because you heard there is a person trying to have sexual intercourse with as many people as possible. If what I have said doesn\u2019t help you believe that this information about a \u201csexer\u201d is false than let me know, because I would be seriously worried.",

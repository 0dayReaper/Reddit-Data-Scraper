    "postText": "Hi, I am planning on attending Brandeis for graduate school in the fall, and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the best area to Boston to live in if you are going to commute to Brandeis? My plan of living by Porter Square and taking the Fitchburg line seems to be a bust... I was looking at  living in Allston/Brighton and taking the 57 then 553 bus? Does anyone have any experience or advice? Thanks!",

I've never taken the 57/553 but the 70 bus goes from Waltham through Lower Allston, then to Cambridge, so that'd probably be another possibility. \n\nEither way this is going to be pretty expensive, but so will living in Boston, so if you have the money...",

The closest real T station is Riverside which is like 5 min drive away but the shuttle to Riverside doesn't (at least it didn't used to) on the weekdays so you'd have to Uber. \n\nMaybe you can look into carpooling somehow? Otherwise just owning a car might save you many headaches",

    "postText": "OK so I'm done all my homework for the weekend and I just want to find a place to just unwind, watch youtube, play videogames before I go to my clubs/do social stuff. Problem is I'm in the dorm from hell (East quad represent) and staying in my room is literally unbearable. I kind of feel bad about being in the library bc I see everybody else doing homework. Also it's pretty weird to be in a lounge acting like a total antisocial hermit in front of everyone else. Any ideas? (plus if u play PC games hit me up :D)",

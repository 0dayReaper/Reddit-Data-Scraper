Lots of interdisciplinary courses which makes it easy to double major or add a minor. I think they have a Humanities Fellowship as well. Most professors are top notch and very popular among students: Chad Williams (AAAS), Joel Christiansen (Classics), Jonathan Sarna (NEJS), Irina Dubina (Russian). The Near Eastern and Judaic Studies department is probably their strongest in the humanities.",

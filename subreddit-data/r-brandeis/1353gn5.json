Just know that East is a hellhole. \n\nThere are forced triples in first year and I believe some East dorms?(not sure on east) but it is what it is. I don't ever care or pay attention to privacy so can't comment on that.",

In hall style dorms, bathrooms are stalls and showers have double curtains (sometimes single curtains depending). Most dorm buildings have their floorplans posted on the DCL website if you want to look and see.",

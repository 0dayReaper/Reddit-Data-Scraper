    "postText": "title says it all! will talk abt pros/cons as i see them for each school + intended major. any thoughts, feedback, or general advice will be much appreciated - thanks in advance y'all!!\n\nintended major at WPI: bio/biotech\n\nintended major at Brandeis: biochem/biophysics\n\n## BRANDEIS PROS\n\n* got the QBReC scholarship - $20.5K / year in aid + some sick opps in research as a first year. This would be INSANE for my intended career in academia. it also helps that the advisor for this program is extremely well connected.\n* Brandeis is an R1 school, and their big focus is life sciences (as opposed to wpi's focus on engineering)\n* i really enjoyed the homey feel of the campus + i also vibed really well w the ppl i've talked to so far\n* waltham is a lot closer to boston, which is good for opps bc boston is the biotech capital of the world!\n\n## BRANDEIS CONS\n\n* 15K / Year more than WPI - this is the real kicker. don't want to sink my parents in an insane amt of debt in undergrad esp bc i want to go to grad school.\n* no one working directly in my niche of interest.\n\n## WPI PROS\n\n* merit scholarship makes it less expensive than going to state school.\n* researchers working in my niche of interest (stem cells)\n* employers in the northeast (aka biotech central) seem to love WPI so i won't need to worry as much re: job prospects. this will be especially useful if I need to work for a year or so to save up for a PhD.\n* really vibed with the 'solving problems' focus + balance of theory v practice based on what i've seen on WPI's bio/biotech curriculum.\n* also really loved what i saw of the campus on my tour and the people i've met from WPI so far. seems to have a strong community, which is something i value a lot.\n\n## WPI CONS\n\n* WPI is an R2 school at the end of the day, and I feel that applying to a good grad school for PhD would be tough bc of this.\n* have heard that bio/biotech is generally considered secondary to engineering by the school, so i'm not sure how that affects opportunities specifically for research\n* Not sure if the project-based learning / IQP / MQP deal. allows any time for independent research.\n\n**tl;dr**: brandeis is amazing for lifesci research but would put my family and i in a ton of debt vs wpi is more financially feasible but doesn't seem to be as good for lifesci research as brandeis.",

            "comment": "Brandeis Biochem/Biophysics program is a mile better than WPI's, but it's not worth the debt, and UMass Medical School is a ten minute drive away. I'd go with WPI and try to find a lab that'll let you volunteer at UMass Med as soon as you can - probably around early-mid sophomore year. UMass Med has great research, and all of their undergraduate researchers come from Clark/WPI\n\nAlso, grad school is paid, so you don't have to worry about burdening your parents with more debt\n\nALSO, your niche of interest is liable to change dramatically, and most areas of research in the life sciences have a lot of overlapping expertise and skills. I'd approach any research program with an open mind and not let this factor in to your decision at all.",

This is super helpful. \n\nre: grad school, I'd heard that it's paid, but really nice to get confirmation on that.   \nre: niche of interest, I hear you on that. I'm pretty open to that changing, and what's nice is that both schools have professors doing research in areas I'm interested in, even if it isn't exactly stem cell research.\n\nThanks again!",

            "comment": "I did biochem when I was at Brandeis. Excellent program. As an undergrad I personally wasn't too picky what my \"research niche\" would be. I found the scientific training, environment, and experience much more valuable. I would even say research niche isn't super career-defining unless you're going into academia at the late-graduate/post-doc level. Otherwise you'll find yourself discovering new research areas along the way.\n\nBrandeis will prepare you **very** well for graduate/PhD school if that's your goal. Many of my classmates are now in graduate schools, and they're all doing very well, including myself.",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t think that the extra 15K is worth it. If you do enough research and are passionate about what you are doing, a graduate school will accept you even if you go to an R2 school instead of and R1. Even if it doesn\u2019t work the first time you can do work experience for a year and try again. I am a current Brandeis student, but most of my family went to WPI and I can definitely say that both schools offer great research opportunities! Personally if you are not looking to be a med student I would suggest WPI, because it is less expensive and bio isn\u2019t the focus (less competition for research positions) whereas Brandeis does have more competition in biological sciences. \n\nBrandeis is a nice school, but when it comes down to the final decision, the college that offers you the best scholarship is normally the better option for you. They are the ones that are sure you will excel.",

            "comment": "Yo, I was one of the guys who spoke at the QBReC orientation. I can't promote the QBReC program enough man. The amount of connections you get through the program is honestly astounding. Plus, you are basically guaranteed research at a lab during sophomore year. However, I hesitate to keep promoting brandeis considering the amount of debt it will put your family man. From what I understand, undergrad has little to no impact on where you can get into for PhD programs. Especially considering the fact that WPI and Brandeis are honestly not that far apart in the \"rankings.\" In the long run, I am not sure if the benefits of QBReC will justify the extra 60K in debt. I would ask the QBReC head Jane more if you are interested.",

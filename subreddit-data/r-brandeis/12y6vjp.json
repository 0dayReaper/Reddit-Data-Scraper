Say literally anything-anything at all-that would help incoming students.  \nAre any professors terrible at teaching? Is there any super useful resource that you think made life easier here? Affordable and good food u recommend? Go crazy :)",

I have a spreadsheet for this, but whatever works for you works.\n\nAlso work to take at least a few classes that you're curious about! Brandeis is pretty good with double majors and the like so don't feel like you have to be locked into a single major. I'm a CS and Politics double major, which have nothing to do with each other but I like both and I can do both.\n\nAs far as social stuff goes, I'd suggest putting in effort to get to know people and join clubs. I've often seen people have a hard time being the one to ask to hang out so if you put in that effort you likely will get it reciprocated. It's a leap of faith but worth it!",

It can be somewhat unreliable, especially at night, so if you are someone who is uncomfortable walking in the dark, just plan accordingly. \n\nMint is super good at repelling most bugs and pests so having that on you will be useful in some of the dorms. Amazon should sell a spray form, but I'm sure you can find it elsewhere. \n\nAlso AK's has pretty good food and is close.",

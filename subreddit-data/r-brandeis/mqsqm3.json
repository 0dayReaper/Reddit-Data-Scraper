    "postText": "THIS THREAD IS MEANT TO BE ANSWERED BY BRANDEIS C.O. 23' OR EARLIER ONLY OR ANYONE WITH AT LEAST A SEMESTER OF CAMPUS EXPERIENCE IN NON-COVID.\n\nI'm a current Brandeis freshman and have only ever been able to experience Brandeis in the shadow of the global pandemic. As such, my time at Brandeis has been a mixed bag of experiences; somewhere halfway between a traditional small college setup and a very high-schooly and isolated environment.\n\nMy question is this: will Brandeis differ (i.e. become more social and open) after COVID, hopefully as soon as the Fall semester of 2021? Now OBVIOUSLY the answer is yes, but I am wondering about the extent of said change. Of course with more students on campus and with social distancing regulations removed, the campus will become a much more interactive place. However, based on the people I have met and the consequential impression of the Brandeis student body I have developed in my year here, I am pessimistic towards the openness and socialness of a post-COVID Brandeis.\n\nSo, if you have fond memories of times when Bradneisians filled the quads and halls on our lovely, tiny, ugly for half the year campus, please let me know of them.\n\nIn short, will it get better? and if so, by how much?",

The dorms were so social, the library was the most social place on campus, people were always outside in big groups when it was warm... it was wonderful! I wish I could predict what post COVID Brandeis would be like but I honestly don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it will go back to the way it was. But I\u2019m hopeful that brandeisians will adapt and find new ways to connect with each other",

However, once I found my people and settled in, I've grown to love it here. I'm not sure if the social scene will not improve dramatically after covid. If I were you I'd get involved in Greek life, or a club, or something if you are unhappy with your current social situation. That is really what did it for me.",

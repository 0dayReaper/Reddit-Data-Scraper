Basically the housing situation this year is way worse than it has been in previous years and it's left a bunch of people stranded. Administration has pledged to fix it, but it's not happening fast enough.\n\nIt is fairly easy to find housing off campus though, and there's a shuttle that will bring you to campus. Lots of people have never had to do it before, and it all works out.",

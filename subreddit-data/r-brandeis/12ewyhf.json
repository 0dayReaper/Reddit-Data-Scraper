    "postText": "Hello! I have read that the only animals allowed in residential halls are fish contained in 10-gallon-or-less tanks. Is this policy primarily concerned with avoiding animals that can escape? Does anyone know if other animals that can be kept in tanks and cannot escape/survive if escaped, such as hermit crabs, silkworms, and certain snails, can be kept in dorms?\n\nI don't even have any plans in this regard\u2014simply wondering because I want to maintain some nature around me. If all else fails, I'll just keep plants.\n\nThanks!",

The overwhelming majority are mixed gender. Cable typically has an all girl floor and an all boy floor, shap basement is typically all boys, and there\u2019s one other in Massell that\u2019s usually single gender too.",

And as for the second floor I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s all I can remember. The floors look identical with the exception with the lounge on the first floor. The only difference is the people in it, and whether or not the bathrooms are all gender or single gender. Hope this helps!",

    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm hoping someone on here has attended the MA program for computational linguistics, or at least can give me some information!\n\nI am interested in applying to Brandeis University for the MA program in computational linguistics for the fall 2017 semester. From what I understand, the programming requirement must be taken before being admitted. I assume that this cannot be taken after admission, but if so, please correct me.\n\nIf I need to take an introduction to programming course, could someone please point me in the direction of a solid, accredited course that would fulfill this requirement?\n\nIf it means anything, I do backend web development with Python/Django for a living and have a few pet projects in Python and R for data science/machine learning/NLP/etc., so I'm not entirely new to programming, even though I lack a CS degree.\n\nI have emailed the graduate school, and hopefully they will respond soon, but any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

You don't need any programming experience to apply but if you are accepted I believe your continuation in the program past the first semester is contingent on doing well in the introductory programming course, or so the wording would suggest. I was not in the comp ling program myself, but I was a TA for the introductory course (COSI 11a) and I remember assisting multiple students in their first year of the comp ling program. ",

I was pretty sure that it was contingent on making a B in the course while in the program at Brandeis. However, I definitely want to make sure all of my ducks are in a row, as I am really drawn to Brandeis and would love to attend this graduate program. I certainly don't want to be denied admission because I didn't understand the prerequisites!\n",

I wasn't too worried about getting a B in the class, as I feel fairly comfortable with the topics that would most likely be covered in an intro class. From the sound of it, I won't need to take an intro to programming course before being accepted as I can just take it at Brandeis. Just wanted to be sure so that I'll have everything squared away before sending in an application!\n\n",

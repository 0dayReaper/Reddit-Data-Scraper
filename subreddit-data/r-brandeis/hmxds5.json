We at Brandeis University have a great percentage of international students - please consider signing and supporting them. They should be able to study without any obstacles, just like us.\n\n**PETITION #1 (200,000+):** [https://www.change.org/p/united-states-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-allow-f-1-and-m-1-students-with-valid-visas-to-stay-in-the-united-states?recruiter=287236121&amp;recruited\\_by\\_id=331e9c10-ee3c-11e4-9762-43b6ebb0511d](https://www.change.org/p/united-states-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-allow-f-1-and-m-1-students-with-valid-visas-to-stay-in-the-united-states?recruiter=287236121&amp;recruited_by_id=331e9c10-ee3c-11e4-9762-43b6ebb0511d)\n\n**PETITION #2 (60,000+):** [https://www.change.org/p/immigration-and-customs-enforcement-stop-sevp-from-blocking-international-students-from-their-colleges-and-universities?recruiter=1128617079&amp;recruited\\_by\\_id=f0d39060-bfee-11ea-9ea1-e95018f6a81f&amp;utm\\_source=share\\_petition&amp;utm\\_medium=copylink&amp;utm\\_campaign=petition\\_dashboard](https://www.change.org/p/immigration-and-customs-enforcement-stop-sevp-from-blocking-international-students-from-their-colleges-and-universities?recruiter=1128617079&amp;recruited_by_id=f0d39060-bfee-11ea-9ea1-e95018f6a81f&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=petition_dashboard)\n\n**PETITION #3** (submitted by u/itsnotforrent)**:** [https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/allow-f-1-students-stay-us-through-fall-semester-if-instruction-online-due-pandemic](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/allow-f-1-students-stay-us-through-fall-semester-if-instruction-online-due-pandemic)\n\n**PETITION #4** (submitted by u/johnabbe): [https://www.change.org/p/student-and-exchange-visitor-program-sevp-allow-f-1-and-m-1-students-to-remain-in-the-us-with-online-only-classes](https://www.change.org/p/student-and-exchange-visitor-program-sevp-allow-f-1-and-m-1-students-to-remain-in-the-us-with-online-only-classes)",

    "postText": "Which is the better PT/distance/continuing ed/extension graduate program: BU Met, HES or Brandeis GPS, and why?  I have looked at these three institutions and can see many pluses and minuses.  Would like some insight on the following: educational experience, time commitments, prestige/perception, alumni network quality, and post-degree career.  I am also interested in any first or second hand experiences with graduate degree programs from these schools.  Please do not devolve into the arguments over HES vs Harvard University or other arguments over HES legitimacy...Reddit, Quora and others are filled with that and I think it has been well discussed.\n\nI have seen some discussion on BU Met, a lot on HES, but little on Brandeis GPS.  More insights are welcomed.\n\nI am particularly looking at either a finance or data analytics graduate program.  I am early in my search, so I do not have specifics.  My employer will pay for $8,000 in tuition a year, so I am will only be out in terms of time spent. I will be taking this part time and via distance learning.  Yes, I realize HES has an on campus requirement, but it fits my schedule.",

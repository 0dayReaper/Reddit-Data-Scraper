But I have started to be curious of whether the classics MA program in Brand is funded or not.\n\n\nAt the web page of Brand's classics department, it is written that one who is in master program is eligible for financial aid(https://www.brandeis.edu/classics/masters/admissions.html).\n\nHowever, I am wondering of whether this 'aid' is just mere words or not, especially in the case of Brandeis classics MA program.\n\nAny advice or information for that? I truly expect to get the replies and thank you very much in advance!",

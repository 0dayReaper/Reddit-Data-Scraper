    "postText": "I never used a delivery app before and have seen other students pick up stuff outside my residence hall all the time, so when I ordered just now for the first time I listed the address as 415 South St and in the optional section (not delivery notes) I listed that I lived at Shapiro Residence Hall. \n\nApparently it didn't work and my driver got a bit lost (not his fault, I apologized) but I got a call from the student who was helping him and kinda got very passive-aggressively berated for \"making drivers' lives way more difficult than they have to be\" and got turned into a villain and I just don't want that to happen again :')",

            "comment": "in the app move the pin/location to wherever you\u2019re living. easy choice for you is to just type in shapiro hall/H lot and the app may be able to find it but make sure within the little map preview it\u2019s where you want them to deliver. I know uber eats gives you the option to adjust the drop off location using a map so you can mark where you want to meet them, best of luck",

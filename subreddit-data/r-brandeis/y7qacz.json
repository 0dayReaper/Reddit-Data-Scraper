    "postText": "I\u2019m a freshman so I don\u2019t really know a lot about this stuff, but shibboleth.brandeis.edu won\u2019t load on my computer on any browser, and to my knowledge it\u2019s the only site to be acting this way. It works on my phone but I can\u2019t go on forever without being able to access Latte, Workday, etc. from my laptop. Have tried restarting, restating network settings, checking if my antivirus blocked it by mistake (still not sure about this), so there might be more I could do, but a lot of what I\u2019ve seen suggested to me seems like processes me and my lack of software knowledge should not attempt.",

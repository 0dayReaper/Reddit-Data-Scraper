I'm excited about attending but my parents don't make a whole lot of money and I'm sure to graduate with some debt if I decide to become an Owl. Conversely, I've been accepted to the University of New Mexico where between in state tuition and a scholarship, I would pay next to nothing to attend. But what have your experiences been like with financial aid/accumulating debt? I value the liberal arts and appreciate learning environments that are small and personal, plus I'd love to get out of New Mexico. But...\nTL;DR Is going to Brandeis worth it? ",

            "comment": "Brandeis Alum here (C/O 2012). Brandeis was hands down the best decision of my life. The people are amazing. Everyone is odd in their own way but everyone will also stop and give you a hand whenever you need it. As Monkeyhalevi said the sciences are absolutely top notch. They are pretty tough, and you will find yourself in classes with Masters and PhD students, especially if you do Neuro (I was a Neuro/Bio double major). That just serves to push you that little bit extra (and the professors don't treat you differently regardless of whether you are grad or undergrad). The other departments are pretty good as well. I had a few friends who were History majors that loved every one of their classes (it you want to do History at all, take a Kapelle class). I have also heard good things about Theater, Psych, CoSci, and others.\n\nAs Ladybugslover implied, Waltham is not really a college town. Its a working class town. However I still enjoyed going out to Moody Street. There are no clubs that I know of (the Skelleg does have dancing) but there are a crazy amount of bars and restaurants that are pretty good. Plus you have very easy (and free on Thurs-Sunday) transport to Boston. Boston is AWESOME. There are tons of things to do in Boston and there are tons of schools in the area so you are never short of new people to meet. There are also always parties going on on campus or in the off campus fraternities/sororities if you are into that sort of thing. \n\nAlso Brandeis gives you an interesting amount of options for expanding yourself. For example before going to deis, I had never even been on a stage before. By the time I graduated, I had been in 4 plays and an a capella group (I think we have like 7 on campus). Intramurals are always popular and fun as well (though the student refs do suck sometimes). \n\nSo yeah, I loved Brandeis a lot. Its not hard to have a good time there, provided you go out and make the good time. There is always something to do somewhere, whether it be on campus, in Waltham, in Boston, or elsewhere (bus tickets to NYC are only like 10 bucks each way). I can understand financial roadblocks; Brandeis isn't a cheap school and I was extremely fortunate to receive pretty good scholarships. But if you have the opportunity, I really hope you go to deis. They were easily the best four years of my life.\n\nP.S. One thing that will suck? ITS COLD! I'm from Florida and had absolutely no clue what I was getting into in that respect. Still well worth it though.",

            "comment": "Current quite-happy Brandeis freshman here (: I agree with what people below have said; I like that Waltham is residential and not a college town, but that's because I like having a campus. I use the Boston shuttle every weekend to see my boyfriend in Cambridge; it's easily one of the best perks of going here. I like being a little out of Boston but still being able to get there via shuttle or commuter rail if I want to. \n\nLike everyone's been saying\u2013\u2013the sciences here are hard (and reputable) as fuck. I know a lot of people at MIT and their Orgo classes and lab aren't as much work as ours are. Also, the neuro major is intense (19 required classes yaaaaaay) but it plus financial aid were what put me here. \n\nYou like liberal arts--what kinds? Social sciences? The psych department here is jacked, so is the English/History of Ideas department (in my 2 classes of experience plus hanging out with a bunch of professors). \n\nBrandeis is on the smaller end of medium-sized. It's a contained campus (which I love because it means everything is within a 15 minute walk) but it IS one huge hill. Takes time to get used to, but seriously my calves are amazing and I have endurance without even working out. \n\nBut yeah. I'm really happy here and glad I made the choice to attend. I think you have to weigh the pros and cons of debt\u2013\u2013if you attend here, your degree and probably connections/networking will be better, but none of us can tell you if that's enough to drive you here, you know?

            "comment": "Class of '08 here. \n\nI have relatively mixed feelings about Brandeis. I had a great time and made great friends--I met my fiance at Brandeis--and still keep in touch with many of them. However, I feel like this would probably have been the case at most schools I attended, since I'm a fairly social person. I would not say that Brandeis served me better socially than any other school would have.\n\nI feel like my education was pretty top notch and the faculty was great, but I don't really have a basis of comparison since I never attended any other higher learning institution. I work in finance, and I felt I was definitely well prepared in terms of my Econ degree.\n\nWhen I was looking for a job, I found the network to be not so great. But then again, I was looking for a job in banking/trading in 2008 in New York, so I don't know how much of that can really be blamed on Brandeis. I do think that the network has gotten better over the years.\n\nIn the end, I had a great time at Brandeis. Better than at other schools? I can't really know. The best part? The same as any school: chicks are easy.",

            "comment": "If you end up coming here, *bring warm clothes.* I'm from even further north than Boston so the cold feels like nothing to me, but to someone from New Mexico, New England will seem frigid.\n\nThe people here are not huge partiers by any stretch. The frats are pretty detached from campus life, and way more people like to get high rather than drunk, so huge parties aren't that often. Also if you're looking for a big school atmosphere, you won't find it here.\n\nPersonally, I think Brandeis has a great balance between proximity and ease at getting into Boston (I disagree with the guy who said our transportation sucks, see my comment below) and actually having a campus, greens, woods, etc. If you know where to look, Waltham has some nice places around it to get away from the city. \n\nThe Skellig does have some cool stuff, I'm a folk player so I enjoy joining in their Sunday night tunes, but as others have said, Waltham isn't much  of a college town. The real fun is in Boston. Boston has an INCREDIBLE music scene. There are piles upon piles of cheap venues that get good shows, and medium-price venues that get fantastic shows. Also going to the other colleges in Boston (there are so many) can be fun.\n\nFull disclosure - I'm getting more than half of my tuition paid for from various scholarships from the school and from my state.  Even still, my family and I are scraping jars to allow me to go here. I'm gonna have a LOT of debt to pay from loans. This is an expensive school.\n\nAlso, we have an amazing faculty. We really are graced by some of the gems who have devoted their time to teaching here. If you decide to come, post again and people will tell you all about some of the professors.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nTL;DR: Brandeis is chill, the location is awesome, amazing faculty, but it's expensive. I say it's worth it.",

We have a free shuttle that goes to two seperate locations in Boston Thursday - Saturday quite late into the night, and during the afternoon on Sunday. The Bran Van is a pain in the ass to book, but if you just wanna go into Waltham, it works. There's a commuter rail stop basically on campus, and if you can get a ride to Riverside, it's the closest Green Line stop to campus. It's pretty easy to get to Boston. And the shuttle that runs to Boston on the weekends runs all over campus during the week. We have great transportation.",

My lab and several others are doing amazing things with sensation and perception research etc. I also had the option of choosing between a cheap state school and Brandeis, and I have no regrets choosing Brandeis and taking on the debt. That said, make sure your interests line up in a way that will allow you to financial handle the debt load (if you should wind up with it). I will say, if you are in dire straits, they do have \"emergency\"-ish financial aid they can trot out. Make sure you get in touch with Sherry Avery in Student Financial Services. She's stupendously helpful and very pleasant to work with. ",

I visited Brandeis in April and had an amazing time though. Do any of you know Ross Johnston? That guy's the best prefrosh guide in the history of the world. He took in another prefrosh from a guide who wasn't interested in portraying Brandeis in a good light (and was also just more or less off putting). Ross actually convinced the kid that Brandeis was the place for him and he ended up enrolling over UC Davis. It was the coolest thing to watch. Y'all continue being awesome in Waltham. I'll definitely be missing out in some respects choosing NYU but I'm confident that I made the right decision for myself. Thanks for all the advice.",

            "comment": "First off, they may or may not be raising tuition next year by 5%. That being said, the food is crap, we frequently waste money on unnecessary programs and there's not enough housing for juniors and seniors. I'm just being honest. However, that may or may not be the same for the other schools to which you were accepted. People here tend to be liberal, except for the insular community of Orthodox Jews. I'm pro Palestine so I'm very uncomfortable discussing my views about that on this campus. However, we have a decent amount of funding for clubs. Unfortunately, students decide where club funding goes and next year they may or may not be adding yet another level of bureaucracy to that process. I'm gay and I generally feel safe on this campus. However, campus police have, in the past, not taken complaints of rape seriously. I wouldn't feel comfortable approaching them in order to report sexual assault. What else ... the people who work at the medical center are incompetent. The architecture clashes. Glass on brick. That being said, the professors are generally nice. We have shopping periods for classes, but science majors don't get any choices, rendering the shopping period irrelevant, since there will be only one section of the class you have to take. Financial aid isn't great, but it could be worse. I have lots of loan debt. The undergraduate advising system is broken, but if you're lucky enough to get an adviser who cares, then you'll be all right. Some of the Community advisers are good, but the bad ones keep getting rehired year after year because they don't hand out the evaluation forms! We have good academics and lots of people here are sex positive and supportive of gay rights, which was important for me. Feminism is pretty strong here, too, but we still get weird bro-ey male bodied people who hate female bodied people and treat them like objects. But I hope they're a minority :) For some reason, we have a phys ed requirement. I'm not sure anyone knows why ... it's just kind of there ... for no reason. \n\nTL;DR Pick a college with more money, but if you don't mind debt, we're a great liberal and gay friendly school.

Especially curritos in upper usdan has some bangers (that tikka bowl can rock me all night long). Generally, first-years go way too hard on the swipes, so just keep that in mind. It's not *good* food, but imo it's solid. Especially since in lower usdan, if you don't like anything there's always the salad bar. You just can be picky here.",

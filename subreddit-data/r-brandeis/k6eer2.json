    "postText": "I\u2018m considering Brandeis as my ED2 school \u2014 i love pretty much everything about it. The only thing that\u2019s making me hesitate applying ED is that i\u2018m not sure how strong the jewish influence is on Brandeis and if that would cause me to struggle fitting in. I\u2018m christian and grew up in a mainly christian neighborhood mixed with atheists, jewish people, and muslims. I have no problem with going to a jewish school and all that comes with that like having a stronger focus on jewish history &amp; holidays but i\u2018m worried that the fact that i\u2018m not jewish nor am i really informed in jewish culture will make it harder for me to fit in, especially when I hear that even some jewish kids who aren\u2019t as religious have a harder time fitting in.\n\nCan anyone tell me about the extent of the jewish influence on Brandeis? Are there any non-jewish students who could share their experiences?",

Haven\u2019t felt left out of anything either. The fact that it has a Jewish influence maybe even makes it MORE accepting of people of all faiths, as opposed to other elite liberal arts schools, which can be very secular. If this is your one hang up, don\u2019t be concerned.",

            "comment": "As a non-Jewish student, my perspective is that the experience bears similarities to what I imagine having a secular American university in Israel might be like. \n\n30-40% of the student population is Jewish. Jewish identities are highly visible on campus. You will encounter many people wearing kippahs, observing the Sabbath/Shabbat, practicing Kashrut/kosher, and fasting for Yom Kippur. Most Jewish students I've met are pretty liberal and don't necessarily adhere to practices we associate with orthodox-Judaism or highly committed practice, but while outside Brandeis, encountering these practices might be unusual, they are very normal at Brandeis. Furthermore the school more-or-less fully accommodates the full range of Jewish practices. There are dining halls that are 100% kosher. There are paper COVID-19 campus passports for the students who cannot use phones while observing Shabbat. None of this is imposing: at no point do I feel pressured to practice Kosher or Shabbat, and the school fully enables me to break either.\n\nBrandeis also observes a Jewish holiday calendar. If you aren't familiar with the Jewish calendar (like me), you'll get a number of days off that you didn't expect. Luckily our breaks line up with the important Christian calendar holidays (for example Passover and Easter overlap). \n\nWhile I'm not an undergrad, I have heard there is a degree of Jewish clique-iness in the student population. I am certain you will encounter people who will not be close friends with you largely because you do not share the faith with them (just as there are in Christian circles), but I am under the impression that this is a minority of people. You will also meet many Jewish students who are extremely friendly, and can even be a liaison for you in explaining the unfamiliar Jewish culture you encounter on campus. Also keep in mind that the majority of Brandeis students are NOT Jewish.",

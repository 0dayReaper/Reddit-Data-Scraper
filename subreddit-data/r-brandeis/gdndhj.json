It seems undergrads lean pretty hard on their clubs/student groups for socialization. There's not much entertainment in Waltham proper, we have some good restaurants, a movie theater, a few townie bars, and some nature preserves nearby. Brandeis itself has a small bar and student groups that do music/performances, but you have to go downtown for real concerts/nightlife. \n\n&gt; Is it convenient to go into Boston, and do people do so regularly?\n\nWe have a commuter rail that takes you into North Cambridge/North Boston, and a (free) weekend shuttle-bus that stops by Harvard and MIT. Only caveat is that both of these services won't get you back after 1:00AM. Uber rides to/from downtown are around $30. The shuttle bus can be pretty packed on a nice weekend night, and people certainly do go into town, but I find that even I don't get into town as often as I'd like. I'm sure it varies with the friends you hang out with. \n\n&gt; how would you describe the lgbt+ community (or general acceptance) in Waltham?\n\nI can't speak from personal experience--but from my perspective, I would say Waltham is moderately liberal, and at least not overtly hostile towards the LGBT+ community. LGBT+ people and culture are somewhat visible in the city of Waltham, and I haven't heard any of my LGBT+ friends express that they have felt unsafe or harassed for their identity. Brandeis itself is more insulated, and has a really robust LGBT+ community.",

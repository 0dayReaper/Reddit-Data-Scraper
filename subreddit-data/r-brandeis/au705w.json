    "postText": "Hi. From California and will probably be coming here for an internship at D'assault for the summer. No car and im looking for housing that's not too expensive. \n\n1) how expensive do sublets get around the university during the summer?\n2) if you're interning at D'assault and will be in the area or can offer a car pool, or just wanna introduce me to the area, I would be more than happy :)",

            "comment": "Plenty of listings on Craigslist. If you DM me I can also put you in touch with the graduate student housing Facebook group, where people also put up their sublets. Expect to pay ~$800/mo for your own room in a nice-ish house, and $1000-$2000/mo for a room in an apartment. \n\nI have no afilliation to Dassault, so unfortunately I can\u2019t help you on the carpool front. There is a bus that takes goes from the Waltham train station to a stop in front of Dassault. Waltham is relatively bike-friendly as well if you\u2019re comfortable riding in traffic.",

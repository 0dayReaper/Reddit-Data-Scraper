            "comment": "I am not sure if I can answer this question definitively, but it seems that if you got an invite to apply to QBReC, you've already been pre-selected, and quite likely to get in. More than that, you may be pretty confident that you will be admitted into Brandeis, and will be among the approximately 10% of the applicants awarded their standard-size merit scholarship.  You still have to write a couple of essays though.\n\nNow, is it worth the trouble? IMO it is one of the best opportunities Brandeis has to offer to a STEM-oriented kid.  It's a lot of fun, and it looks good on your student resume. Basically, it's a guaranteed spot in a lab research program.  The first semester you take a QBReC seminar, which teaches you how to do research, and in the second semester you do a research rotation in a couple of labs.  QBReC is also a \"community\", which gives you some early networking opportunities, and could lead to some more permanent research positions, or REUs.",

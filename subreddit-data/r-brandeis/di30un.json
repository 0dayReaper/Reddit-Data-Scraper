Although every comment agrees that Brandeis is a great school academically some say the social life is not as good. Is this the reality? Because I am planning to come from very far away I want to be %100 sure.",

There were definitely parties and drinking and whatnot but agree with the other poster that they weren't insane. House or apartment parties, no like crazy block parties. I was in a fraternity too but things rarely got crazy. But there were so many social groups/clubs/sports/etc that people (including myself) made friends at. My best friends in the world (who I still see at least once a year) I met at Deis",

I'm in my first year at Brandeis rn so I can give you some current impressions on the freshman experience. \n\nI was also worried about the social scene - I'm someone who likes to have big groups of friends and go out a lot. It is not an issue at all, and I have found so many really cool people to hang out with. There really is a social scene for everybody. Parties are not HUGE but they're not tiny either, most of them are at frat houses and it's pretty easy to find out about them. After the first two weeks you'll pretty much know what frats are having parties when.\n\nI'm not on any club sports teams but I have some friends who are. They made a lot of friends that way, and a lot of these clubs have their own socials. If you're looking for a more lowkey social scene you can find that too. I was really worried about making friends here bc what I had heard made it seem like everyone was awkward and very serious, but I haven't found that to be the case at all.\n\nGood luck with your admissions process!",

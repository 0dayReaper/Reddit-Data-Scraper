There are some good professors and some that aren't so great, you kind of have to figure out which professors have the teaching style you prefer and then attend those classes. The big thing I'll say is that you won't get a job as a software engineer just paying attention to classes, you have to motivate yourself to do work outside of classes to learn things, but that's most CS programs.",

If you\u2019re really comparison shopping with other schools, carefully check the class sizes. We\u2019ve probably got most big universities beat, but an SLC might have more teaching resources.",

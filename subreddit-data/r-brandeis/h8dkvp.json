Also, if you're going to be doing research for 2-3 years you might want to check out the BS/MS program. You can graduate with a Masters degree at the same time as it takes do your bachelors, at no extra charge. Some folks argue an MS in the sciences isn't super useful, which has some valid points, but I'm 3 years post grad and I'm glad I got my MS",

            "comment": "There are a lot of labs to choose from for sure. The lab selection is kind of the luck of the draw. The PI will basically send out your \"Hi I'm \\_\\_ and I want to do research bc \\_\\_\\_. Here is my resume \\_\\_\\_\" to the lab, and then a grad student or postdoc will take you on. \n\nThere are some pipelines for it such as the QBReC program (I think that's how you spell it). Some labs won't take you till after you take bio lab and other labs don't really care. I will say that you should join a lab when you're ready to commit and will make time for it. Brandeis is a small school, and the research labs know each other very well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps :) you'll be fine!! And remember, the best lab experience is one where you will be mentored!!!",

            "comment": "I'm a first year here, RD, and Brandeis gave me a bunch of money and that's why I'm here (other from the fact that I got rejected from everything but my safeties). As far as I know it, they are friendly to international students financially. \n\nFor my stats, my main \"attributes\" are a 4.0 unweighted(4.8 weighted), captain of my math team that finished 2nd in states, my own SAT and General Tutoring, spokesperson for an NYU education program, and 2 social media accounts with 80 million total views. \n\nI know people who got into Brandeis with far lower accolades than these from my school -- and your school rank, I think, will be a good factor.\n\nBut, one thing to note is that, like many schools this past year, the admissions rate shot way down due to their high acceptance the previous year. Brandeis' acceptance rate went from 33 to 39% my year, so with this in mind, it may be harder for this year...\n\nBest of luck to you",

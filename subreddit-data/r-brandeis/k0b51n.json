            "comment": "If you look at other colleges in the area, almost everyone experienced a surge in the past week. Tufts' undergrad community had almost half of their cumulative cases test positive last week. Community spread off-campus is leaking onto campuses. \n\nIt's particularly telling with faculty and staff numbers climbing. Aside from a handful of people in DCL, faculty and staff live off campus. While it's possible they got it on campus, there are far more limited opportunities to spread among workers compared with students. \n\nSo many local colleges experiencing dramatic increases (double, triple, or more their average weekly positives) when, with some notable exceptions, most schools have done really well keeping covid at bay is definitely not a good sign for the general community. \n\nStay safe, everyone.",

            "comment": "There\u2019s been an outbreak in the science department among grad students and research staff accounting for (what I estimate) is around third of the cases. Generally speaking it\u2019s inevitable that outbreaks will spread aggressively through labs since we work in highly trafficked spaces and share a lot of equipment. We\u2019ve had sanitation, de-densifying, and distancing protocols in place, but the reality is that it is not always possible to practice perfect sanitation and distancing.\n\nEarlier this year we had really strict density restrictions that resulted in people having to postpone experiments or take overnight shifts in order to continue their work, and those restrictions had been relaxed once cases in Waltham came down since they were pretty inconvenient. Pretty much the day of the first handful of cases the department shut buildings down for a week and has re-instituted the ultra-low-density restrictions from the spring. A lot of us are voluntarily not coming in an effort to snuff out the outbreak.",

    "postText": "I will have more questions, so if you're willing to let me PM you, please let me know!\n\nI wanted to ask: \n\n1) I just read that Brandeis is amazing in academics but lacks as a college in every other way. I'm assuming they're referring to college life. Can someone give me an example? I know I can seek out the life I want no matter where I go, but I want to know how the natural social scene is there w/o trying to seek anything out. Thanks!\n\n2) how is Pre-med advising at Brandeis?",

However you'll find that it's easy to make friends and there are plenty of clubs to join.\n\nI looked through your post history quickly and noticed you are concerned about going to a non-diverse and non-accepting school. You'll find that isn't an issue at all at Brandeis and it's an incredibly diverse and loving school. If you're able, I highly recommend touring the campus while school is in session to get a better feel for it.",

I would often go into Boston nearly every weekend, there are tons of clubs, and I found it easy to make friends. I think people say this about the school because for whatever reason a lot of people like to complain about the school. I think the folks who complain the most either weren't the most popular kids in high school and don't know how to make their own fun, or they're bitter about getting rejected at Brown. If you're unhappy at Brandeis you'd likely be unhappy at most schools.",

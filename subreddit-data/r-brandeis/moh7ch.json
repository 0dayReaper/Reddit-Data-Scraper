    "postText": "Hey Brandeisians!\n\nI'm an incoming student, I really want to join Brandeis the only thing I'm hesitate is about the student life at Brandeis. No offence but, I've heard Brandeis has a nerdy culture, like everyone is focused on academics and stuff.\n\nI'm nerdy too, but I still want to have that \"well-rounded\" university experience, so I was wondering, How easy/tough it is to make new friends and socialize?  What's the party scene like at Brandies? What are some amazing clubs? Are there any facebook groups? \n\nLet me know please!",

I joined a frat, an improv group, and a research laboratory, all of which threw their own parties/social events, each with different vibes. There are lots of clubs and groups, but you have to seek them out yourself. Brandeis doesn\u2019t spoon-feed you a social life, but you can absolutely have a great time if you put a little effort in.",

It\u2019s extremely tough to meet people here for most freshman. Also the school has very few social clubs and no recreational sports clubs(this year at least maybe they\u2019ll return next year) and completely lacks a party scene. \n\nThere will probably be a Facebook group for admitted freshman within the coming months.",

If you want to hook up with someone and never see them again... not going to happen. I think I prefer the small greek life though. I like knowing most people at the parties, and I feel really close with most people in my organization because there are only about 35 of us. Sports teams also throw down, but you need to be an athlete or a girl friends with athletes.",

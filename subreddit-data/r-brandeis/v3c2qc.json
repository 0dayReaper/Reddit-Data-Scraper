But, I've heard that at some schools applying RD as a legacy counts against you. So, does being a legacy have an impact on admission, and if so, does it hurt to apply RD?",

The most you\u2019d hear about being a legacy if admitted would be a congratulatory P.S. on your acceptance letter. If anything, RD applications are viewed more favorably since they indicate real demonstrated interest and guarantee a yield for the school if they admit you (which looks good for their stats if admitted students accept, even via RD).",

            "comment": "I just had her this past semester. I think she\u2019s pretty good but very different from mascall. She is ver explanation focused on her tests and ssg so be prepared for that. Also she doesn\u2019t curve but rather gives reflections afterwards to improve grades. She\u2019s a decent lecturer in that she is very clear but can be a bit boring. She was very understanding and open during the transition to online learning and made it easy to adjust. Overall she\u2019s great and very good during office hours.",

I can answer questions about biology/chemistry/Biochem as most my program is in these departments , but I\u2019ve also taken history, politics, and social science classes as well. If your not certain as to what you want you major to be it\u2019s always a good time to take gen ed reqs especially language as you need to take a 30 level or higher to fill the requirement.",

I'm still working on transferring the credits from my previous institution, so I am still uncertain if I made the req or not - language is one of them. Thank you for your advice tho. I will take a look at the gen-ed courses.",

If you have any interest in cultural or linguistic anthropology, they are great ones to take courses with.\n\nCalc 1 and 2 were also fun for me.",

I have heard horror stories about BU's treatment of students caught partoking (yeah that was a pun). I was confronted with the same decision and while sometimes I rip on Brandeis for being such an awkward place, I still could never imagine going to BU. We have the research opportunities of a much larger school, amazing professors, some of the best people I've ever met, and a social life that appears to be improving by leaps and bounds each year. The thing is, there's a lot to criticize about Brandeis but most of it is superficial and everything else is in your hands. If you want to have a good time here, you will. I wouldn't recommend going to BU if you're even considering going to Brandeis, unless you REALLY want to live in Boston. Also, to actually answer your questions: the dating scene is difficult because of the large number of long term relationships but that's not to say that it's really a bad thing, the girls are more attractive each year (as I've heard and seen) I, personally, do feel kind of trapped but that's because of the intensity of my major and classes. When I was a freshman I went to Boston multiple times every weekend and pledged a Fraternity. There are parties at Brandeis, typically the large ones are thrown by the Fraternities. They aren't always great. ",

I know the area decently well but when it comes down to it I'm happy I can say I don't live in Boston. Originally I only wanted to go to a school directly in the city (NYU GW AND BU) but somehow I ended up at Brandeis and I don't think I'd be able to get any school work done if I actually lived in the city. Besides, having an actual campus really is a nice thing. In terms of transferring, It's always hard and it's kind of silly (unless you're going to a better school or really hate yours). Midyears can have a rough time, though. There is a tendency for them to band together. It's not a requirement (obviously), just something that happens. Also, if you're doing compsci, I'm friends with your TA. ",

I actually live in NYC, but chose to go to a school in Boston because I wanted to learn how to  live outside my home city. It seems it is going to be a big transition from living in the fast paced lifestyle of a newyorker to going to Brandeis( My HS alone has 5500 kids). Why do midyears have it rough? Also I visited Brandeis last weekend, talked to a few students etc and saw a bunch of students lounging around on the grass listening to music. Is this the highlight of the social life on the weekends or is there more? ",

You don't seem to me like the kind of person who would let that get in their way though so I wouldn't worry. I wouldn't say that sitting on the grass listening to music is the highlight of anyone's weekend here. You must remember that, while there are people here who are content to spend all of their free-time studying away, many of us are capable of balancing school and fun. Brandeis' social scene is rooted primarily in campus-clubs (in terms of school-recognized options). However, roughly 9 per-cent of the student body is involved in greek life and a vast majority of us take advantage of it. Brandeis parties are not necessarily known for the awesomeness but that doesn't mean that they suck (or that they aren't frequently very good). If you're really worried about having a good social life here, may I suggest exploring the greek route. It's basically like thelidhathappeal said: \"As long as you find your place here, you'll have the time of your life.\" The reason I came to Brandeis, (and didn't apply for transfer) was the professors here. They're awesome; we steal them from Harvard. My first semester here I hated it and talked about trying to get into a different school, then I joined a Fraternity and I like it here now. Besides, doing that compsci program you'll be pretty busy. On a final note: If you loved Brandeis (or even liked it) from your tours, that's a lot more than I can say for myself. ",

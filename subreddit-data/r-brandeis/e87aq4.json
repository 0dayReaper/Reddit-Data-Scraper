    "postText": "Hi, I am currently an ED applicant and will hear about my decision soon. I am considering majoring in Psychology but from the course requirements I get the impression that most of the courses are linked with biology. Is it possible to create a study program that focuses more on social and cognitive psychology?",

            "comment": "Brandeis offers an opportunity for students to create their own major, if this what you\u2019re referring to, then no, this is probably not an option considering psychology is such a clearly defined program here.  A friend of mine made his own major here, but it was something that we didn\u2019t offer entirely.\n\nCognitive Psychology revolves heavily on biology and neuro so avoiding biology for that wouldn\u2019t make sense. The cognitive courses fall under group 1 where you need only two courses, and you need two from group 2, social psychology courses. \n\nYou could do the major and then take more social psychology courses to fill up your schedule or you could look into Sociology which is along the avenue of Psychology, but may be more in-line with what you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re looking for more social behavioral courses. You could even pair that with a Psych minor.",

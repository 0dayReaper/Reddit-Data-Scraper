    "postText": " Hi guys :)\n\nI was recently admitted to USC and Brandeis. I'm super shocked (was rejected from my dream school Tufts and also from northeastern and BU). I'm really grateful that this happened but now I'm faced with a tough choice and I've been breaking my brain trying to decide.\n\nBackground/goals: I'm from New England and my parents wanted me to apply to schools in the area. I convinced them to let me apply to USC under the \"it wouldn't hurt to try I'll probably just be rejected anyway.\" The other school I'm considering is Brandeis. My overall goal is to become a researcher and attend graduate school and get that PhD.\n\nA personal side note to consider: my closest friend who I've known since middle school got into Tufts and if possible I'd like to be with them since it's been our dream to go to college together/be nearby, specifically in Boston. This makes the decision much harder.\n\nMajor: psychology or cognitive sciences\n\n**USC**\n\n*Pros*:\n\n\\-Ranks higher, both in general and for my major\n\n\\-bigger school/ I've heard from a student at Brandeis that after four years, it felt too small\n\n\\-better weather\n\n\\-in a dynamic area, I could \"escape the New England bubble\" \n\n*Cons*:\n\n\\-across the United States. This is the biggest con, I'm generally a pretty anxious person and don't know how the adjustment would go for me. Also buying plane tickets could get pricy.\n\n\\-the area around USC doesn't seem the safest, my parents are very concerned about this. I've never seen the campus and won't be able to before May\n\n\\-it's pricier than Brandeis, but still doable\n\n**Brandeis**\n\n*Pros:*\n\n\\-I've wanted to go to college in Boston since middle school and it's in Waltham so very close\n\n\\-I can cross-register with Tufts. My heart still feels set on Tufts so if I do decide to transfer, I'm sure having a Tufts class on my application would help a lot\n\n\\-very good money thanks to scholarships and financial aid\n\n\\-my personality is a better fit for the more \"quiet and nerdy\" vibe\n\n\\-has my dream study abroad to Oxford while USC doesn't \n\n*Cons:*\n\n\\-ranks lower in both major and overall\n\n\\-campus felt a bit small \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading all of this! :) I know at the end of the day it's a decision only I can make but I'd really appreciate any input on this",

            "comment": "The campus is a bit small. If you don't have a car, which I didn't coming from the west coast, it was also a bit hard to commute between boston and waltham. Doable, but mostly on the weekends, and much more difficult in the winter.\n\nFor cross registration, I'd really consider what your method of transport was. It seemed interesting to me, but in the end I took all my classes and Brandeis because taking a class somewhere and timing my commutes etc. would probably chunk 4 hours out of my day just to take that one class at another school in the area.  \n\n\nThis all is all probably not as relevant with covid and zoom classes and what not, but that's what factored into those things for me.\n\n  \nAs for USC, it's a very rich school, and they've been gentrifying the surrounding area for as long as your parents have heard that it's surrounded by a bad neighborhood, it's really not as bad as people think, having visited the campus and area with my friend who goes there in February 2020. As for being anxious and thinking about adjusting, socal is probably one of the least difficult places to acclimate, culturally, or physically.  \n\n\nI went to Brandeis, so I don't have the larger school experience, but I think you'll probably be able to find your type of people at a large school that's integrated into a large city, it might just take a bit of more work. It seemed a bit harder at a smaller school, and seeing the same people everyday/at every party god old pretty quick. I did find a good group of friends though that I still talk and game with occasionally a few years out after graduation.",

What if you go to Brandeis, apply to transfer to Tufts, and are rejected? Will you still be happy at Brandeis?",

            "comment": "No one I know has done cross-registry as it's more trouble than its worth generally. I worry that you might mostly be interested in Brandeis because it's closer to a \"Tufts\" experience than USC (though that's arguable). Something also to consider is that, while Brandeis does have an Oxford abroad program, it's a year-long study and not just semester. While I did enjoy my time at Brandeis, USC is a great school. A few of my friends from high school went and loved it. As far as safety is concerned, most areas that are primarily occupied by college students are pretty safe.   \nFor what it's worth, I am also an anxious person and I went cross-country for college (From Seattle originally) and I really loved breaking out of my bubble. Good luck with your decision! You got into two really good schools.",

Frankly, you have two very good, albiet wildly different choices.",

Obviously, do your research and make the decision you think will be best. But, ultimately, what matter more is what you make of your opportunities at each school both socially and academically. I wish I'd kept in mind more during my college admission/decision process is that this decision is not going to determine how happy or successful you are. Its about what you make of your experience that matters, not the details of the particular experience.",

I hang out with my close friends and that's about it.\n\n2) non covid:  The frats here are not good, but you can take the train into Boston for nightlife. Brandeis however is not a party school, and if you come here expecting lots of big college parties you will be disappointed by the shitty cramped basement parties you get. This school thrives on friend ships and gatherings of 2- about 8, hanging out in dorms and apartments. One of the things Brandeis advertises explicitly is that it is not a school that attracts partiers, it's a bit more quirky and small scale. That being said, we live in an area with lots of colleges so you can travel elsewhere to other big schools for big parties. This is all in the past of course though, with covid we won't be back to that standard for probably at least another year.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am a class of 25 student at Brandeis. Recently a prospective student posted about the \"Brandeis sexer\". I can confirm his identity, as I am the sexer's roommate.\n\nFor the total year I have spent no less than 75% of my nights in the lounge until at least midnight. Usually he begins around 5 pm and he will have sex with at least 3 people a night. I would say my current estimate is about 197 women, 84 men, 27 NB, and at least one proffesor (male). To the new admit, the sexer is real - be very careful about handing out any social media. He will hit you up and try to sleep with you. I have seen him leave for a girl's house with a box of condoms only to return with it completely empty. He said he got \"A little sidetracked\". I have seen him not only hit on proffesors, but also dining and custodial staff. He always carries a condom for quickies in bathrooms. He has propositioned me for sex on 3 occasions, only 1 of which I accepted (he was very gentle and romantic which is why, but I'm not gay so I declined the other two times). Be warned - He's not pushy but he is extremely charming. If you talk to him for more than 5 minutes privately you will more than likely wind up sleeping with him.\n\nAnyways, hope to see you next year new admit! Go judges!!",

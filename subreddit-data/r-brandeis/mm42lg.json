    "postText": "Hello!\n\nFirst year student here. Going through the housing process for next year, I started glancing over my options for junior and senior year as well. My question is: What do you do if you don't really have a group of friends or people you want to live with? I don't see any options outside of Charles River (or housing for prospective study abroad folks) that doesn't require you to have a group of 4 or 6 people and that makes me anxious. I know that things may change next year, but as a person who has done the first full year of classes online, I can't think of a single person I know well enough to feel comfortable living with. \n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Hey! So for housing outside of your first year, there are so many options for an individual. If you want a single in a dorm, you could for Village, Skyline, Efficiency Single in Grad, or East. If you want a single in a suite with other people, you could for Ziv (6 people). If you want a randomly assigned double, you could go Village, Skyline, or East. If you want suite style living at some point, there are 2,3,5 person Grads; 6 person Zivs, or 4 or 6 person Ridgewoods. As a sophomore, you can live in Rosie which is 4 person suites. As a senior you can live in Mods which is 4 or 6 person townhouse style apartments.",

However, I don\u2019t really know if I trust myself to go for some of the more advanced classes based on what I know, and also I don\u2019t have an exact idea of what I\u2019d like to study. Because of this I feel it would be best if I invested my time into various intro-level courses that pique my interest, as opposed to skipping some of those courses with my AP credit (is that how it would work?) and getting overwhelmed.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019d be a good idea for me to receive credit for my English, Spanish, and History/Gov classes instead, so that I can enter Brandeis with 16/128 credits already form and spend my first semester being introduced to topics that are interesting to me. Is this a good idea, or even possible in the way I\u2019m viewing it? Also, are there any other pieces of info or unintended consequences Im not considering (like potentially have to take a harder language or history class later on)? \n\nThanks for taking the time to read all this, ended up being longer than I had initially anticipated  \n\n\nTL;DR: Is it smart to opt to earn credit for AP scores that don\u2019t align with my interests, so I can focus on introductory courses?",

Worst that happens is you revoke a couple of classes that weren't giving you credit anyways. Brandeis doesn't limit the amount of APs you can send, just the total amount of credit awarded. I can't advise you which are worth skipping (not a STEM student), but do note that the language requirement fulfilled by AP takes 3 semesters of courses which meet more frequently, unless you place out of them.\n\nAlso, politics and language are the only non-STEM courses that fulfill any requirements. English and History may give you credit, but you won't fulfill any university requirements with them.",

            "comment": "Agreeing with the other commenter here, the best move would be to send all your scores for numeric credit. It's pretty unlikely you'd \"test out\" of any meaningful number of requirements using APs, beyond a language. I sent all my AP scores and used them to get numeric credit, but didn't bother testing out of anything because they weren't particularly relevant to what I wanted to pursue, and those courses don't take APs anyway. If you've done APs in your interest areas (e.g. AP Bio or AP Calc), it's still for the best that you retake them again here.\n\nI got a 5 on AP Bio and still learned plenty of new things in Bio 15, and I honestly think it helped a lot and gave a far stronger foundation. The Registrar's chart (google Brandeis AP score chart) will tell you which courses each AP tends to \"mimic\" in terms of content (but not that they fill those same requirements for a degree).",

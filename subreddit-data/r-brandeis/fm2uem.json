    "postText": "I am an international transfer applicant to Brandeis for fall 2020 sophomore. I have done loads of debating on national level both in school and in college. I was also the school captain back in school and the school magazine chief editor. My percentage was a 96.25 in school but in college, it took a hit with debating and stuff and I have a SGPA of 8.09 rn. How do you think my chances are for getting into Brandeis?\n\nSide note: I had applied for undergraduate initially and was a finalist for Wien Scholarship but then after the interview realized that I didn't clear the eligibility criteria for undergraduate and hence my application was updated to transfer.\n\n\nUpdate: I got in!",

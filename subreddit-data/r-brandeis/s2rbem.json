The essay portion is very important, make sure you write something that you\u2019re extremely passionate about, my passion is teaching, so I wrote it about that. Also, I submitted my college board essay from AP Seminar, so it\u2019s very much possible, never lose hope until you see it on paper, and even then, there are other plenty of places you\u2019ll be happy at, Brandeis included. Best of luck friend, pm me if you have more questions !",

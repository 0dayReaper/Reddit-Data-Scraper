My roomie is pretty sensitive to noise so I don\u2019t want to bother him with my terrible playing.\n\nIs there a club of some sorts at Brandeis for this type of thing? It looks like there used to be, but maybe it\u2019s gone now.",

You might try to revive it if it ain\u2019t around anymore. \nAlso, Slosberg\u2019s practice rooms are a good option.",

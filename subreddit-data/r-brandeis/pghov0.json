Try and put your interests out there (join clubs, hang out in rooms with things you like to do), and chances are, you\u2019ll probably meet others like you there. I mean hell, I was pretty miserable here the first few days, but after I got used to no AC in my room and the meals being slightly repetitive, I was able to meet some friends who I could hang out and play games with.",

Out of all of the Boston schools for example (bc I have friends at Tufts, Harvard, NErn, Bu and Bc so I visit probably every other week) it\u2019s nowhere near as cliquey. Someone said it to me once and I forgot who but it was golden: brandeis is where the non popular kids from hs go and then they\u2019re told they\u2019re popular at brandeis. It\u2019s this archaic, confused version of a college social life and being such a small school really doesn\u2019t help. \n\nThat being said anywhere you look in the country, you\u2019ll find kids with a close group of friends but the options to socialize are wayyy larger and the emphasis on cliquing is wayyy lower because of that fact.\n\nAnyway welcome to brandeis transfer apps open every august, shoot to transfer as a junior ! :)",

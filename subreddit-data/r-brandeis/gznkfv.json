    "postText": "We are conducting a research study to learn if data collected through smartphone applications (apps) may be helpful in understanding more about daily life and stress in college especially as it relates to exercise, sleep, screen time and social interactions during this period of social distancing\u00a0brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study involves downloading an app to your smartphone. This app was developed by researchers at BIDMC and is used for research only. That means we would never share your personal data, and all of our results will be completely anonymized. This study would involve:\u200b\n\n* \u200bDownloading the study apps to your phone.\n* \u00a0\u200bA video visit (about 1 hour) to complete mental health assessments. **Paid $100.\u200b**\n* \u00a0Using an app to complete mental health surveys and allow passive data collection (like GPS) for 28 days.\u00a0Interactions with the app are expected to take about 1 - 2 minutes each day.\n* \u00a0\u200bA video visit (about 1 hour) to complete the same mental health assessments again. **Paid $150.\u200b**\n\nThere are a few requirements for participation in this project:\u200b\u00a0\n\n* Must be an undergraduate college student.\u200b\u00a0\n* Must be able to speak English.\u200b\u00a0\n* Must be regularly seeing a mental health provider for treatment or counseling. Must be able to provide us with the contact information of this clinician as well as your address. This is only in case of a serious emergency.\n\nContact [jmelcher@bidmc.harvard.edu](mailto:jmelcher@bidmc.harvard.edu) to enroll or ask questions!",

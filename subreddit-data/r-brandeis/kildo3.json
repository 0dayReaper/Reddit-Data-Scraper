    "postText": "Hello fellow judges,\n\nI'm currently finishing up my post-bacc graduate certificate in Clinical Laboratory Science but I've been looking into online master programs in bioinformatics. I'm not too familiar with Brandeis but after speaking to my professor about it, she said it's a very prestigious institution. I've looked at the program curriculum and I keep getting more and more drawn into it. \n\nMy question is, has anyone in the program feel confortable being a full-time student (2-3 courses) while working full-time? Do you feel like all the resources are available as an online student versus in-class setting? What courses would you recommend to start with?\n\nI'm expected to graduate in April and take my certification exam in May and I was thinking maybe taking one course during that time since I will only be studying for my certification exam? After that I would like to take 2 courses per quarter (3 if its feasible). What do you guys think?\n\nAny insight and advice will be great as I already spoke to the advisors but I would like to receive some student perspectives. \n\nThanks in advance. Happy holidays :)",

If you really want to know maybe send an email to admissions seeing if they have anyone they could connect you to. I graduated a while ago and only did undergrad there so I unfortunately can't answer your question. I did love my time there though!",

            "comment": "I didn't do the bioinformatics program at Brandeis, but I was an undergrad there in CS and biology and now am in bioinformatics academia, and id be a little worried about the quality of the program. Brandeis doesn't really have a lot of professors that specialize in bioinformatics (at least when I graduated in 2017). I feel like their true strengths neuroscience, so maybe if youre interested in that area, the program makes more sense, but if you want to get a really good foundation in bioinformatics I think there might be other online programs better suited (Ive heard Hopkins and ucsc are good)",

    "postText": "I'm a Brandeis graduate myself (IBS '11) and my roommate is looking to sublet her room. I'd love if this person went to Brandeis, only because I remember the graduate students as being a fun, diverse, interesting crowd. We live right in Porter Square, a 3-5 minute walk north of the T and commuter rail on Mass Ave. The room is availabel April 1-June 30, with the option to renew the lease then. Here's my craigslist ad, with pictures: http://boston.craigslist.org/gbs/sub/3672660902.html",

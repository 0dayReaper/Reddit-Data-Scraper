    "postText": "I got accepted midyear and I am wondering if this is a bad thing. \n\n1. How well integrated are midyear students on campus, especially if they do not do study abroad the first semester?\n2. Regarding the Arcadia study abroad for London (the other ones I'm not even considering) for anyone that did it, was the experience good and did the classes fulfill the requirements to get all caught up? How were the classes if they were not taught by Brandeis staff? And with regard to advising, did you feel isolated from Brandeis, as in was Arcadia in the reigns wholly or was Brandeis practically breathing over your shoulder?\n3. How was the the adjustment to London, being in a foreign country at 18 years old with people you never met?\n4. How was the study abroad socially? Did it seem easy to connect with people? I read another post on this subreddit talking about how the study abroad in London was \"cliquey\" and with the \"popular people\". How true is this?\n5. Does the London program have gender inclusive housing?\n6. Was entering in a cohort of 100 people an advantage or a disadvantage?\n7. If you did not do the London program, can you speak to what you did instead?\n8. What are some additional pros and cons to both the midyear and the London program?\n9. I know this is not the University's official policy, but is it possible to enter in the fall by asking them or by giving them an excuse?\n\nThanks for your response.",

So I can\u2019t answer your questions about integrating but I can tell you I won\u2019t be traveling to Philly, London, or Florence (even though I speak Italian so I almost did) because being in a foreign country for the first semester of college I thought was not the best way to stay focused on getting good grades. I am applying to take classes at Columbia as a visiting student for a semester and will take freshman classes that will transfer into credit for Brandeis.",

            "comment": "I am an international student accepted as a midyear so...\n\n1. Dunno, I chose London for my first semester, but when I got back I did not find anything not integrated, so probably not a problem at all.\n\n2. As a person never been to England and even Europe, I found it a great experience. Living in London can be expensive, but most of the time I feel like taking a great long trip in London, exploring anything I am interested in. Great scenery and a lot of things to do! \n\nThe classes are okay, not really difficult, and mostly like a tour of London too (My sociology class included a live soccer match in the stadium and my London diversity class included a curry feast in a Bangladesh restaurant). But, most likely they will not fulfill any of the requirements back at Brandeis (apart from UWS).\n\nThere isn't much about advertising \"college pride\" in either Arcadia London or Brandeis in my opinion.\n\n3. It's okay I guess, as a Chinese I had my first roommate American, and he was a nice guy. We got along quite well, and you could also get a single room. Living in London is convenient, some residence rooms are studios with a kitchen (I was lucky to get one) so you can easily cook or order takeout or eat out.\n\n4. I am not a social person so I don't know it well. At least among the many Chinese students, we had several nighttime chats with tea and games during the orientation week. If you can make friends in your classes I think you are good. \n\n5. I think everyone regardless of gender live in one big house called Princess Elizabeth House.\n\n6. You will get to know your fellow midyears a little more and maybe connect with them more when you start your first semester at Brandeis. Those relationships may continue or gradually wear out depending on you I guess.\n\n7. N/A\n\n8. Speaking from a transcript perspective nothing really good, as your Midyear status almost guaranteed that you could not graduate early unless you do more than a standard number of classes every semester. One can only have a maximum of 16 credits from transfers (4 courses, one standard semester), so if you have AP or IB credit that could have been transferred to Brandeis, your Arcadia courses will exceed the maximum limit so your AP/IB ones are wasted.\n\nHowever, after the gains and losses, I still think the London experience is great enough to mitigate that little problem, as living in London for half a year (before the pandemic) was one of the best moments of my life so far. \n\n9. I really don't know, maybe you could ask the staff.",

A bunch of my friends this semester are midyears. It is a little bit more difficult though, since you\u2019re coming into an already established space - you do need to make the effort to make new friends. People will be happy to oblige though! And of course you have your midyear cohort to fall back on.\n\n9. (this is 9 but it\u2019s displaying 2 for some reason and I can\u2019t change it) You should ask if you\u2019re interested in this! Worst they can do is tell you no.\n\nHope to see you on campus next spring!",

Are you happy with the teaching style of the professors? Do you ever have live zoom meetings? What is the reputation of the program in the industry? Are you able to utilize what you learn at your current job?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you,\n\nJudit",

I had a broad understanding, but I felt I wanted a deeper knowledge of tools and hard skills. I have gained so much confidence in these areas.\n\nThe vast majority of the teachers have been great to work with, most are industry professionals and talk about their own experience and background.  Every week there are reading assignments, a discussion post (and follow up) and an assignment due. Typically there is a weekly recorded lecture/slide deck.\n\nThe classes are all online/ at your own pace. Students are all over the country, pretty much everyone works full time and takes one class at a time. There will occasionally be live \"open door sessions\" where students can meet with professors to ask questions. These are kind of like an optional bonus lecture. Or when working on a group project, you might get together via Zoom with your team. Some classes have Slack channels set up for communication as well, which is helpful when you are in different time zones.\n\nStudents will often post discussions or choose to work on assignments related to the work in current role. You will definitely be able to directly utilize what you learn to your job.\n\nThis program is unlike some other HCI programs in that it is truly UX focused. It is great for someone wanting to get a career in UX or advance in their role. Many people will compare Brandeis with Bentley, the rival school next door. Bentley has a highly regarded UX program but at a much higher price. From what I can tell the classes have been filling up more quickly lately and they are offering more classes each semester. It seems the program has become increasingly popular since I started in 2020.\n\nThe downside of the program is the lack of networking and career resources that you might get from another full-time or in-person program. But I have personally seen peers land great jobs by building a portfolio from the work they have done in class.\n\nHope this helps!",

I'm currently in an MFA program, and I'm not getting enough UX Design classes, so I thought about transferring to Brandeis as well. I, too, have taken \"BootCamp\" style UX classes online and want to learn more for a proper career pivot. I also want to teach PT in the future. I thought Brandeis would be a good program and fit for my needs. Thank you! =)",

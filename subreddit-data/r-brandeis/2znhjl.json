In fact it's better than many Freshman dorms in other  schools that I've visited. The castle is fine, too. Currently posting from my dorm room inside castle. It's getting renovated over the summer so it will look awesome from the inside as well as the outside.\n\nWhat IS important is that you make friends during orientation. The more the better. Be open to everyone, cause it's a small school and everyone sort of knows each other. The first-month friends stick to you for the 4 years.\n\nYeah, there's a lot of weird people and SJWs here. It's super easy to avoid the culture after a while.\n\nYes, it's a comparably rigorous school and people are VERY motivated here.\n\nAll in all, don't stress about anything. Even making friends here is ridiculously -- people are so friendly they will come across as insincere at first (they aren't!).",

            "comment": "Having done a neuro major (which definitely helped me into med school) I can say Neuro is a pretty tough major. A lot of the classes are grad level classes so there will be a healthy amount of masters and PhD students in your class (at least on the neurobiology side of classes). There are a ton of prereqs to the neurobiology classes (at least there were when I was there-1 year of gen Chem and 1 year of biology so 2 years before you actually can tackle classes toward your major) but the best thing I did was pass out of gen Chem with APs. If you can do that you are going to have such an easier time. You can also knock out some of the neuropsych classes en route to the prereqs for the neurobio classes if you want. I don't know too much about CS classes, but one of my best friends was a CS major and he loved it. Plus it got him an amazing job right out of undergrad. \n\nAs I am a few years out, I can't comment on current campus goings on (no idea what the rape thing is either) but I can tell you Brandeis was the best four years of my life. Best of luck! If you have any other questions feel free to ask",

Brandeis has had incidents as well. Some students feel the administration handled it poorly, and in many respects it did mishandle some cases. \n\nhowever, to just haphazardly lob out that the school is lenient on rapists is just inflammatory and lazy. \n\nOn the other hand it is a very very accurate depiction of the grandstanding you will find among the student body around every corner. The loudest students at Brandeis are the activists, so just be aware of that. \n\nAlso, if you can handle the course load of a neuro CS double and get decent grades then you will absolutely find success after school.

Lots of college have the same incentives, but all I wanted to say was that this is known to be the case, specifically at Brandeis. I don't mean to be obnoxious or to grandstand, but it is true. And if it affects your safety, this is not a superfluous thing. It is something you should absolutely consider when looking at colleges.

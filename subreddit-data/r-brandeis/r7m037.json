    "postText": "Hi! I applied ED to Brandeis and I'm just trying to find ppl who also EDed or are already attending. We'll see if I get in. I'm super nervous about getting in and I think it'll help if I talk to people going through the same thing with the same school. Or just to meet people who attend if I get in.\n\nUpdate: They sent me an email saying they'll tell me if i got in on Thursday!",

            "comment": "It depends on how much you expect to eat dining hall food (swipes) vs. buy your own food on campus (points). I think a lot of people usually overestimate how often they\u2019ll be eating at the dining hall, or frankly at all, so the 12 is probably fine to start out. There\u2019s also a brief period early in the semester where you can change your plan and get a prorated charge/refund within that window, so you\u2019re not locked in.",

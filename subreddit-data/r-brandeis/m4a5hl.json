    "postText": "Exactly as the title says, looking for the tallest continuous staircase/stairwell that we have so I can do some running on them. Don't really want to do the rabb steps since they're unevenly spaced out. The skyline fire escapes are 4 stories, but if there are any other similarly tall or taller ones, I'd love to know",

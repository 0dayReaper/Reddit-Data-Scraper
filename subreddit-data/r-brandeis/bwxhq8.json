While I am a center-left liberal, I am just kind of scared to apply to a campus where other political thoughts are stiffled and discouraged. Is this the case?",

            "comment": " As many of the other answers seem short and uninformative I will try to be as through as I can. It is bad (at least from my perspective as a conservative alumni), but I would say it is slightly better than places like Middlebury, Brown, and Berkeley. The majority perhaps (65%) of students are tolerant and willing to hear different viewpoints. However, a vocal minority of students (35% or so) who actively engage in shaming those who disagree control the space. A 2016 poll conducted by the [Hoot](http://brandeishoot.com/2016/10/07/political-poll-reveals-student-reluctance-to-speak/) found 50% of students never shared their views and another 27% were usually not willing to share them. The top reasons for their feelings were fear of verbal insults and peer judgment. I can personally attest that I saw many of my vocal libertarian friends actively stigmatized after writing op-eds for \"highly controversial\" topics like \"diversity of ideas\" and not just diversity of skin color. To address these problems the administration has \"tried\" to have [free speech panels](https://www.thejustice.org/article/2017/03/task-force-free-expression) although ironically these often lead to accusations of \"anti-blackness\" by the hardcore social justice groups.  \n\nAdditionally, this group of students advocated and won things like like mandatory [\"bystander intervention\"](http://brandeishoot.com/2015/12/11/club-leaders-must-participate-in-bystander-intervention-training/) and \"racial sensitivity sessions\" for all faculty and club leaders. Unfortunately, the administration often capitulates to these demands under the \"guise of progress\". The [\"Concerned Student Protests\"](https://www.brandeis.edu/president/past/lynch-letters/2015-concerned-students-demands.html)  back in 2015 were a great example of this phenomena. This essentially involved a group of students forcefully occupying a building and refusing to leave unless more black students were admitted and a racial diversity officer was hired. [Full syllabus here](https://www.brandeis.edu/faculty-senate/pdfs/4WorkingSyllabusIAmFordHall2015.pdf). Brandeis administration capitulated fairly easily after just a few days. The majority of the faculty supported the protestors. This cycle of protests has continued [to present](https://www.thejustice.org/article/2019/05/students-protest-racist-policies-brandeis).\n\nMoving on to the faculty side professors particularly in places like Political Science, African American Studies are often an echo chamber of social justice ideas. However, I've never actually seen them punish conservative viewpoints with lower grades. There are small pockets of conservative faculty however they generally stay quiet.\n\nIn summary, it is bad however it isn't as bad as Middlebury where there is actual violence (at least not yet). Although these events affect the entire campus they are fairly ignorable. As I said before you can find plenty of people (particularly in the sciences) that just don't talk about politics at all.",

However, in my experience they generally refrain from devolving into politics too much unless it is the subject of the course. Most of the stigma and negative consequences of thinking outside the box come from the  \"activist\" student groups and student government. But this is primarily true for Conservatives and Libertarians if you are a standard run of the mill liberal I doubt you'll be ostracized too much if at all.",

The only time I had professors get political was during the last election, and they were just asking students to get out and vote. I'm sure if it was a social science class those discussions might come up more, but I was a business / computer science student.",

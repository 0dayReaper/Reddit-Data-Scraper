    "postText": "Hello, I'm considering Brandeis as an incoming freshman and was wondering about the campus life. How has it been meeting people you connect with and making friends? Are there lots of activities to do on campus? Does it ever feel lonely or anything like that? I'm considering between Brandeis and Uconn honors, Brandeis, academically, seems to be a better fit for me but I was unsure about the campus life and social situation at Brandeis. Any information would be appreciated!",

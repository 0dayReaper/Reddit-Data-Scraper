    "postText": "I know it's late, but I thought about applying ED to Brandeis. However, is premed/biology here harder than other schools? I've heard good things about Brandeis, but I also want to know if science courses at Brandeis are graded harshly, and if the STEM students here have lower GPAs than students at comparable schools.",

I know four people getting their MDs at HMS right now, and pretty much everyone I know who applied to med school got in (me included). There\u2019s also none of that toxic nonsense you\u2019ll find at some of the bigger schools, and we have dedicated pre health advisors and much better research than the smaller schools.",

I will say this, as a patient, I really don't want my potential physicians avoiding difficult classes to beef-up their GPA. I want a physician who is confident enough in their abilities to seek out and excel in the most challenging coursework available.\n\n  \nJust my $0.02.",

    "postText": "I was recently accepted into Brandeis and I was wondering how hard it would be to declare a CS major. I've heard a lot from different schools about how it's extremely competitive and difficult to declare, but I don't know what the case is for Brandeis.",

Not hard at all, you just have to meet with a particular professor from the department you want to major in.\n\nAlmost nobody does this before their sophomore year, by the way. You're meant to spend your first year exploring and figuring out what you might want to go deeper into.",

Make sure to take the opportunity to look into more than just CS as part of your education. It'll help you in CS if you also learn about a new area to apply your CS skills towards.",

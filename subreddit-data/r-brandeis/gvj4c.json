They primarily do sleep research there\n* Einstein initially supported his name being associated with the school, but only on the condition that the school only admit Jews.  The Board refused, saying that Brandeis should be open to all, and so Einstein withdrew his support.\n* Central Perk is **not** based on Chum's.\n* Bernstein did indeed teach at Brandeis.",

Usually people organize their social life around pretty close knit and small groups of people, typically around academics (ppl in your class), who they live with (dorm dynamics), and clubs.  There are few clubs but they are generally very good to excellent.    I dont know what else to say without more deets.",

I'm a student who parties almost every friday/saturday + it's not that hard to find/go to parties at other Boston schools (BU, Harvard, MIT, etc.). Everyone is pretty close at Brandeis, and it seems that friend groups are tighter than they are at other schools. It's a school where you choose what you want to do. If you want to party, then you can party. If you don't want to, then you don't have to.",

I have a tight knit group of a few friends and then friends scattered over lots of social groups/clubs/whatever. Everyone is pretty chill for the most part and wind up hanging with new people a lot. Also, if the party scene is important to you, there's pretty much something to go to every Friday and Saturday. The parties aren't crazy but they're still usually pretty fun. Also, not everyone is super serious and academically focused. There are plenty of people looking to have fun, you just have to put in a little work to find them.",

Because of the change in schedules, a lot of people (including non-midyears) even try new clubs too.\n\nDon't be afraid to try, and enjoy your years at Brandeis!",

You definitely should try to talk to the people in your dorm, and go to the activity fair to try to meet people. Feel free to pm me if you want any more advice :)",

After a few weeks, you'll barely even think about it. \n\n- Do join clubs (you can join them any time of year. I'd highly suggest attending the winter involvement fair to sign up for club listservs -- lots of them. Your options are as open in the middle of the year as they are in the beginning)\n- invite friends (and prospective friends) to grab a bite of food or study someplace on campus on weeknights\n- try to find ways to stay busy on the weekends when you aren't studying, campus always has something happening\n- be your truest self! That's who people want to meet! \n\nYou were admitted because you already are a perfect fit for Brandeis. Midyear student arrival is a great infusion of life to campus. You'll find your people!\n\nedit: forgot to add, welcome to Brandeis!!!",

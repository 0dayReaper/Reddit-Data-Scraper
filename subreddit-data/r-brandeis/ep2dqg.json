    "postText": " Hello, I am an international at an IB school. Right now I have an unweighted GPA of 3.3 an ACT of 28 (super scored to 31), taking full IB with HL Physics, Economics and Lang and Lit, with a 33/42 predict. For extra-curricular I lead MUN, Track captain, Leader of a Service group, Radio show club as well as a member of Stu-Co. I'm pretty scared cause my GPA and ACT are on the lower end and I will be applying as an Econ major and i'm not sure how much they value IB and extra-curriculars.\n\nDo I have a shot of getting in as RD?",

I'd say just being in an IB program and having strong extracurricular are a big advantage to you.  I knew a ton of former IB students at Brandeis who didn't necessarily have the best grades.Brandeis also tends to accept a lot of international students, so I'd say you have a pretty good chance.",

We're going to the Skating Club of Boston's brand new facility.  It's $10 to skate and $5 for rentals.  The ice time we are going to is 4:50-5:40pm and it's a 20ish minute drive from campus.  If you're interested in going with us, please reach out to me or fill out this form for transport help (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmiXAr9rNz3rDjxINqL4HE4ANI4WCTEoXu5mZTIg0MOBYUUA/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0).",

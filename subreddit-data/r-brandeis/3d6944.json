But I assume you know you're not getting into it in order to get rich. \n\nWhat do you see yourself doing with the degree? Those I know who have seemed to do the best financially afterward did it as a dual MA/MBA in nonprofit management from the Heller School and then promptly left the Boston/NY/SF areas to somewhere more affordable. Or went to Israel, which is a great option as well. ",

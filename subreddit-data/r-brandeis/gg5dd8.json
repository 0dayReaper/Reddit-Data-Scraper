            "comment": "If you\u2019ve been taking APs like Bio, chem and physics and are comfortable with those courses you\u2019ll have an easier transition than others. \n\nThe thing about pre-med is that ALOT of students come in thinking they\u2019ll be able to do it, but most of them end up changing course. This is usually due to Gen Chem with professor Novak. It\u2019s a weed out course and is difficult on purpose. If you can get through that, changes are you can get through any class. \n\nThat being said, if you are determined and know how you learn best you\u2019ll be able to handle the workload of these intro classes. As for competitiveness, I thought it was a competitive atmosphere. It also depends on the study/friend group you make. \n\nAs you can see all of this varies depending on who you are. The best advice I can give is don\u2019t compare yourself with others and be honest with yourself in your first year.",

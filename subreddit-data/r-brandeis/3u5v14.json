            "comment": " the more you read through the students\u2019 demands, the more they look curiously like a full-employment program for the faculty who just happen to be egging on these naive youngsters.\n\nA key theme in the demands is the creation of new posts in the university for jobs that consist of promoting a leftist agenda. Students at Brandeis demand, among other new positions, a \u201cVice President of Diversity and Inclusion.\u201d Boston College protesters demand that the school \u201cappoint a diversity officer at every college\u201d and \u201cincrease recruitment and retention of students, faculty, staff, board of trustee members of color, international status, and female and/or gender nonconforming.\u201d\n\nStudents at Guilford College, in addition to proposing show trials in which \u201cevery week a faculty member come forward and publicly admit their participation in racism inside the classroom\u201d\u2014Mao Zedong, please call your office\u2014also demand \u201cthe creation of a sovereign Office of Diversity and Inclusion to enforce these demands and keep the administration accountable\u2014these tasks should not solely be carried out through the unpaid labor of students and faculty of color.\u201d",

It's so frustrating to see this whole thing go down. There are legitimate complaints that could be made but the children rather throw tantrums than work with the administration. ",

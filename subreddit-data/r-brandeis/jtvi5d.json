Anyways I am a prospective student looking to double major in history and applied math. Is there any current student or graduate who would like to share their opinion on the program?",

Honestly, I have not heard great things about the math department. My linear algebra teacher was really fucking difficult and kind of a dick, but I learned a ton from that class (study group really helped me). My multi variable calc teacher, Keith Merrill is fucking awesome. Superrrr passionate about math anddd even more passionate about teaching math. His wife is in the hospital right now and he literally is teaching class, hosting office hours, and review sessions from the hallway in the hospital. That is how dedicated he is to his students. But overall I think professors in the math dept are hit or miss.",

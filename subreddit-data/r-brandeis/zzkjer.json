Sometimes they'll do a special dessert for a special occasion.\n\nOn the other hand, the regular chocolate chip cookies are pretty good.",

Nothing insanely gourmet unless it\u2019s parents weekend, thanksgiving, etc. but frankly the desserts are far more predictably good than other food options. Almost always cookies and cupcakes, plus some form of cheesecake or fruit bars, or little pie things. One of the dining halls also has a waffle bar, the other has self-serve ice cream, and both will always have cereal.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone! So my college decision process has been  one of the worst experiences of my life. My family and I were deciding between Brandeis and another school. I preferred the other school to Brandeis while my parents wanted to send me to Brandeis. I got mom on my side but dad controls all the money. Ill spare you the details. Long story short, I am committed to Brandeis. \n\nI know its a good school. It has great academics and  resources as a research school and great professors. It is also very close to Boston. The only downside for me was the campus and the doubts I have about the social atmosphere. \n\nIm sad and frustrated about my college decision and that is not how I want to spend my summer or how I want to arrive at school (I am also a midyear student) tell me things you like about Brandeis and if you can ease my fears. Thanks guys!",

I took my fall semester and worked for an old employer but you can really do whatever. The midyear orientation programming is fine but after your second week, you basically assimilate with the rest of the class. Keep in mind most of the freshman are still meeting each other too so you aren\u2019t missing much plus there\u2019s a extracurricular fair so you can get into clubs when you get on campus. \n\nI\u2019m from Boston, so I have a lot of friends at the colleges back in town too, and there\u2019s a shuttle I used a lot to stay in touch with old friends on weekends. Graduating in 7 semesters isn\u2019t that bad even if you\u2019re going stem, just plan out ahead of time. It\u2019s also looking like fall might be virtual, so chances are you\u2019ll be meeting the rest of the freshmen the same time they are. Anyway, don\u2019t be bummed about being a midyear, Brandeis is still a fun place. Happy to delve into specifics if ya need, I\u2019m procrastinating studying for my calc final and could use a distraction",

Also I know it\u2019s really close, but I was wondering how much interaction yall get with Boston as a city and kids from the other schools around the area.",

Takes between 30-45 min to get into the city with the bus. There are busses till 3AM if you ever want to go to party\u2019s at Harvard or BU for example or are out late. But you definitely need to plan on trips into the city, since the bus times are about once an hour. \n\nThere\u2019s a good combo of on and off campus stuff that a lot of people don\u2019t go to Boston too often though. Brandeis is more involved with organizations in Waltham. But basically it\u2019s up to you if you want to branch out or not with people from other schools. I personally went in to Boston a lot but that\u2019s because I lived like 5 seconds Fromm stop, and because a lot of my friends from hs stayed in the area.\n\nA couple of my friends did study abroad at Florence and London and they loved their time there. Covid like you said will probably affect it unfortunately, so definitely consider if the costs are worth it if it\u2019s virtual.",

            "comment": "So with another poster I graduated a while ago (12 years geez) and Brandeis was hands down one of the best decisions I have made. I had a great time and had a wonderful social life. I met my best friends there and we still, 12 years later, meet up at least once a year (this year was Portugal) despite living in different parts of the country.\n\nI think at the end of the day college is what you make of it. If you're looking for Greek row and parties encompassing multiple blocks, etc, then no way is Brandeis great. But parties, alcohol, friends, shenanagins, etc. do happen regularly (or at least did but I doubt that changed) and I know many friends did take advantage of the proximity to Boston and NYC",

Not sure what your other school was nor what you want to do (that would help!), but Brandeis is an incredibly strong school with a great community. You can easily take the commuter rail downtown and enjoy Boston. Waltham itself has some cool stuff, particularly on Moody Street.\n\nThe campus? It's a pretty average college campus. Walking up the hill to the north side of campus, you will get FIT, man. Just don't take the branvan up there and you'll get your daily exercise even if you stay home the rest of the day.",

They know you\u2019ll integrate well so they have you start halfway because you don\u2019t have social anxiety. Consequently, our dorm had the dopest parties and we all made friends very quickly. My six best friends (14 years after starting at Brandeis) were all midyears with me.",

It\u2019s like a great way to break the ice because then you get to school in January already knowing each other. You get to do whatever the fuck uou want first semester (I worked full time which was VERY HELPFUL having money at school). You guys are all the new kids in January so everyone else wants to meet you and make friends. And you can still graduate on time with the rest of the grade, so you graduate in 3.5 years and save an entire semesters tuition.",

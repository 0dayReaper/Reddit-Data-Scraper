    "postText": "Hey! I'm currently 1st year at neu and trying to figure out what I should do next year. I was really debating going to Brandeis or neu last year. \n\nI struggled A LOT this year, mainly because of the social scene, the size of the class (about 4,000 I believe), the overwhelmingness of seeing so many strangers and the city, and difficulty making the close friendships I hoped for. Generally, I feel like everyone is really busy at neu, and everything moves really fast, and the connections were really surface level. I really hoped to feel a part of a community and have deeper, more meaningful connections. I have always thought about Brandeis and how the campus feel would have made it better. But, I feel it might be another whole adjustment and frustrating trying to join the community as a transfer as a sophomore. And I feel like I have so much freedom right now, being in Boston and I'm not sure if it would be a little bit of a let down not being in Boston anymore.   \n\n\nThanks for any advice you can give me! I really appreciate it.",

I found it really welcoming and accepting, so I think its worthy of further thought for sure",

It was honestly one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nAs you said, I never felt like there was much of a traditional undergrad community at NEU. At Brandeis, the school, surroundings, and social scene really exceeded my expectations. In my short time at NEU, I also felt like students didn't take academics seriously. Quite the opposite at Brandeis.\n\nFeel free to reach out via DM if you have any specific questions.",

Yea class sizes are small but thats for the more advanced classes. The lower classes still have 100 student auditoriums. Also scheduling is really bad. There's basically only one time schedule you can take for each course. Some have 2 tho. One thing I really like about this school is everybody is dilligent. I have never had problems in doing group projects, everyone does their job and shows up. \n\nBut this is just my opinion and experience",

If they wake up in agony, stress and pain, you put em back into coma to try later. If they wake up: are they able to communicate? Is there any reaction from them or not. Sometimes you also reduce em because people have better respiratory functions if they breath on their own instead solely relying on the respirator to do the breathing. Also staying to long intubated causes some problems. That\u2019s why u wanna remove it asap. Otherwise you will get an tracheostomy.",

He fell down the stairs while drunk, got up fine, walked up to his room, went to sleep and never woke up again. They said it was head trauma (they didn't reveal much to everyone). \n\nMy best friend's aunt also died in a similar way when we were still toddlers. Was mugged walking home and hit on the head during the altercation, got taken to the hospital after she reported it to police as she had a few cuts and grazes on her arms and hands they recommended she get checked just to be on the safe side. No sign of anything wrong with her head at the time. While in the waiting room she fell unconscious and died a couple of hours later. They told her family it was the head injuries that killed her. \n\nThe combo of these two stories means to this day I freak out (internally) whenever myself or anyone close to me falls and/or hits their head.",

Getting it wrong in the Premier League can equal relegation and missing out on the millions from the TV money gravy train. Selling an asset that has helped keep us here will always come with risk.

Still remember that picture of him on crutches accepting his player of the season award.)\n\nMaybe I just need to accept that things are fundamentally different now but I still think this perspective on club atmosphere and churn remains valid for us and most teams. I trust Benham but think I can voice my discontent all the same. The margins are finer, and a disgruntled player and his replacement + Toney\u2019s suspension could put the club in a precarious situation.

I\u2019ve said it before, but this is more than just about how much Raya goes for. \n\nGetting it wrong is relegation. There is never ever a guarantee that a new player hits the ground running. That for me is ultimately why the fee to sell the established asset needs to be chunky. It must reflect that risk. I don\u2019t care how good Flekken looks. Replacing someone in such a crucial position brings with it risk. Flekken looks fantastic. But Alvaro had pedigree too and that turned out poorly. \n\nI think you\u2019re just getting this a bit wrong imo, or just reading too much into the fee we apparently want. Asking for \u00a340m for Raya is hardly telling possible signings that we\u2019re no longer an \u201cincubator\u201d type club. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. We made it very clear he can go, be it now, or in a year. Spurs are kicking up a fuss. That\u2019s priced in. It\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve tried to haggle with a deal. \n\nAnd I would stray away from separating Benham\u2019s business acumen and sports psychology and what his dealings mean for squad morale. Every player in that squad speaks so highly if him. He was one of the first to get a thank you in Jansson\u2019s departure speech after the City match. To imply that he isn\u2019t mindful of the psychological aspect or morale is doing Benham a huge disservice.",

You keep repeating this note on finer margins which I categorically agree on but take a different perspective on. It\u2019s true we don\u2019t know about Flekken, but we also don\u2019t know about a disappointed Raya and Hickey, who now takes note that he might be priced out of a move when he wants to leave. \n\nI think you\u2019re just getting it a bit wrong too?

Sarr is highly rated and has been great whenever he's given a chance at only 19. Spence is unknown but was highly rated before arriving, Conte was just a dickhead. Richarlison is Brazil's starting striker over Jesus for a reason and has just struggled under Conte, like everyone else. Royal was very good towards the end of the season. Bryan is a good player, his full potential is unknown. Devine is our most highly rated talent, and despite calls of our academy being poor, it's more our academy management as Madueke now players for Chelsea, Edwards is crucial for Sporting, etc. Scarlett is very talented as well. Porro was/is also considered a wonderkid and has good G/A after just arriving. \n\nI get that you're biased as fuck but come on. I don't think Arsenal has some elite team, but you definitely have some good players. If I can admit that, so should you. It's purely delusional to act as though our numerous young talents are inadequate when they were all deemed wonder kids or very important players for their teams before arriving and getting fucked by Conte.",

It's obviously great to have world class players, but when they go they can be near impossible to replace. We never really replaced Henry or Vieira.

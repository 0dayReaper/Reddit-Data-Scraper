            "comment": "Outrage after Football Champions Trophy  \n\n\n  \nOne of the biggest youth soccer tournaments in the world descended into chaos this weekend in St. P\u00f6lten. At the \"Champions Trophy\" there have been too few parking spaces, mountains of garbage and missing goals. The city sports facility has even been closed.\n\n  \nOnline since today, 14.46 clock  \n\n\n  \n3,500 children and young people from all over Europe aged between eight and 13 years were registered with their teams. Among them top clubs like Juventus Turin, Atletico Madrid and Benfica Lisbon. This organizational challenge could not be met, organizer Gerald Berger confirmed to noe.ORF.at. \"Some partners dropped out at short notice. For example, soccer goals were not delivered as agreed,\" Berger explains.  \n\n\n  \nThe missing soccer goals resulted in a chaotic game schedule that could no longer be kept. For this reason, numerous teams left and the referees were also no longer prepared to deal with the chaos. They stopped their activities in the course of the first day of the tournament.  \n\n\n  \nThe waste disposal and the parking concept in the area of the city sports facility were also deficient. This was closed on Saturday. \"The organizer must ensure that everything runs smoothly. The city has demanded measures in advance regarding parking system, steward services and rescue and pointed out the deficiencies on the first day of the event. After that brought no success, we have closed the facility,\" explains Thomas Kainz from the city of St. P\u00f6lten.  \n\n\n  \nAfter the facility was no longer playable on Saturday and numerous teams left, the tournament was canceled. On Sunday, a few more games were played at the ASV Spratzern facility in order to offer the talents a stage after all. However, this could not alleviate the anger of the parents and coaches. Many were very disappointed after the chaotic conditions.\n\n  \n\"Never experienced anything like this before\"  \n\n\n  \nA coach from Munich vented his anger to noe.ORF.at. \"The entire tournament is a single disaster. We are extremely disappointed. Our boys had to sleep partly on sun loungers because there were too few beds in the quarters.\" The work of ASV Spratzern was highlighted positively, because the club had organized a replacement program within a very short time.  \n\n\n  \nOrganizer Gerald Berger wants to work through the grievances with all those involved in the coming days. But one thing is already certain for him: \"The excellent reputation of the Champions Tour has been ruined in one fell swoop. I fully understand the anger.\"  \n\n\n  \nKlaus Fischer, noe.ORF.at",

Full disclaimer: I didn\u2019t watch the match but based off the clip here it looks like she\u2019s raging at I assume the referee and she was just spitting as athletes tend to do. I know I build up spit when engaging in sport and i find myself subconsciously spitting if I\u2019m hooping outside. She doesn\u2019t even break eye contact when she spits which makes me think she didn\u2019t even realize it landed on the English player.",

Like if the follow through attempted kick to the face woman got a straight red, maybe they would tone it down, instead they get away with it and get encouraged to continue that behaviour.",

Then the uproar after the second goal and claiming FIFA are racist in the tunnel at half time... I honestly thought they were going to walk off after their goal was (rightfully) ruled out for offside. Not to mention the spitting and the awful tackle at the end of the game. \n\nThe referee lost all control of them... The number 3 who was going spare after the offside goal was chalked off should have been sent off... Two straight red challenges which only got yellows... The petulance of the players (spitting, screaming in players faces while on the ground)... Just  a horrible watch really. If you don't know the rules or are not strong enough to follow them then you shouldn't be refereeing in my opinion.. Quite possibly the single worst refereeing performance I've ever seen.\n\nEngland's ladies did well to keep their heads and get through the tie. Yes they were sloppy in places and the offside goal showed if Cameroon actually turned up to play and not piss and moan and be dirty then they could have hurt England, but if they aren't actually aware of the rules and how VAR works then they shouldn't be at the tournament. FIFA delegates had to speak with them at half time and full time. Their federation should be heavily fined and warned if there is any more instances like this then they will be banned from the next tournament.\n\nReal tough game for England next against Norway.",

She touches her arm before she spits, and then after her arms dodge the English players arms to protest the call. She knew where the English player was the whole time.",

It was just a spit, not meant for anywhere, just chance it hit her arm. Seriously before you start getting your pitchforks out please look at it from the side. You'll find yourselves probably wrong.\n\nEdit: like seriously for anyone who spits, just look at her mouth. That mouth action doesn't even represent someone spits downwards at all. She is just shit at spitting, it's as simple as that.",

He did well coaching Dutch clubs and the national team, but outside of the Netherlands his resume reads:   \n- Benfica \u201805-06: 1 season, UCL QF, 3rd in the league, knocked out domestic cup by Vitoria. Left for PSV    \n- Valencia \u201806-07: October to April, CdR victory but sacked with team 15th in the league.    \n- Southampton \u201814-16: his most successful stint outside the Netherlands, 7th then 6th in consecutive years. Several manager of the month awards, Europa League quali, clubs highest ever finish.       \n- Everton \u201816-17: Europa League quali, but did not replace Lukaku despite being given Everons largest ever war chest.  Sacked in October while in the relegation places.       \n- Barcelona \u201820-21: club admittedly in chaos mid-COVID, won a CdR but squandered an excellent opportunity to win La Liga. Terrible start to \u201821-22 season, sacked in October with club in 9th and first manager in almost 100 years w/ 3 consecutive Classico defeats. Xavi would get Barca back to second.       \n      \nI mostly know Koemans coaching since he started at Southampton. He overachieved a bit with those premier league squads and seemed more or less fine. But as a Barcelona supporter of nearly 20 years, he\u2019s easily the worst manager we\u2019ve had that I\u2019ve seen. Worse ideas and outcomes than setien, constantly spouting off and talking shit about players in press conferences, and asking for players that weren\u2019t up to task. People credit him with playing some of Barcelona\u2019s current youth, but the fact of the matter is he had no choice due to economic restraints following COVID and he was far from getting the best out of the squad he had.     \n      \nAll that to say I don\u2019t really put much stock on his opinion in these matters, and the guy is 23. Weird to call him for u-21s at all, and he clearly has other priorities.",

That being, in a dickish way as he always does. You don't want a player? Fine. But there is literally no reason to remove his number fucking twice.

When Puig refused to go on loan and didn't work hard in training Koeman reduced his playing time even more to reward those with good mentality. Don't see anything wrong here.\n\nPjanic: Koeman had a lot of faith in him initially, started him in every UCL group game but he never looked good enough so his playing time was eventually reduced. Pjanic's complaints were laughable, initially he complained that Koeman doesn't watch the fucking recovery sessions after games and then he just said that Koeman was awful tactically, which is completely opposite to what all other players have said about Koeman.",

He and Ansu were extremely promising (Ansu moreso of course) and the most exciting players to come out of La Masia in a while. He had an excellent game against Deportivo and it looked like he and Ansu would be playing in the CL but instead Setien decided to play a 4-4-2 with no wingers and they were curb stomped by Bayern. He got a ton of minutes at the end of that season. Why would he go out on on loan? Also were you there for the training? How do you know how hard he worked.",

His first start came when 4 midfielders ahead of him were unfit/suspended. When those midfielders returned (in the UCL), Setien's \"trust\" for Puig finished, he even gave Monchu minutes ahead of Riqui. \n\nAs for looking promising, it's way easier to look exciting when you're competing against Rakitic, Busquets, Roberto and Vidal (who hated the coach) than when your competition is Pedri, Coutinho, De Jong, Busquets and Ale\u00f1a.\n\n&gt;Also were you there for the training?

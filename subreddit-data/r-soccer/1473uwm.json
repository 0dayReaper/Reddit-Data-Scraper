He was very good for Villarreal before moving to Atleti, and was amazing for Uruguay already in World Cup 2010 and Copa America 2011\n\nHe was a top, top defender for a good 7-8 years at least just that people didn't watch him as much. And between the years 2013-2016 he was absolutely the best defender in the world, I don't understand how anyone can disagree with that. His 2014 year in particular is one of the best I have ever seen from a CB for club and country",

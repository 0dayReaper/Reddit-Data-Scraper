I hope they can keep their current level and make it to group stage at least even though it's not gonna be easy as they are unseeded. \n\nAdana is the capital of kebab by the way. One of the most popular kebabs is literally called \"Adana\" in T\u00fcrkiye because well, it originated from Adana. Imagine being the kebabest place of a kebab country. Imagine how good the cuisine must be for that. \n\nIt would be a psychedelic experience to have Adana Demir as your away trip.",

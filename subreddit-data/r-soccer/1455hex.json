Also knows how to work with big players and get them motivated. Benched an overweight underperforming higuain last season and convinced him to lose weight and become our best player\n\nTactics 100% he still needs to improve. But he\u2019s fantastic working with all kinds of personalities and getting them to bond and work together as a team. Perfect fit for part of an up and coming national team",

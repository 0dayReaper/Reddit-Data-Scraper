Outrage and anger over controversial views generates attention and has people talking about them.\n\nBesides, he also seems self aware and self critical. I admired how he felt sorry for how harsh he was about Maguire. Pundits showing vulnerability or regret over what they have said in the past isn't a weakness and it is sad that some perceive it that way.",

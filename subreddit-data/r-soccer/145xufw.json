If you want to be a well meaning, noblesse oblige type, you are going to part ways with a bit of coin. If you are a sociopath, you are going to be richer than everyone else. \n\nThat is what is screwed up about capitalism - it ultimately means the top ranked folks are all sociopaths. And there are people who think it is a good idea to keep accepting their advice and demands?",

They also made part of their opinions known before the final quidditch match\n\nAnd to be fair it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, the rest of times Harry is hated, the goblet of fire for sure goes along with what you said (in the eyes of the student there are preferences) but for the rest of the series it has nothing to do with preferential treatment, more the fact that the literal government and media are bashing him for\u2026telling the truth about a terrorist and mass murderer being back. \n\nPlus their parents are telling them all summer that the government is right and that Harry is a ego driven diva and that Dumbledore is an old fool past his prime. So for teens that is like open season lol",

There's no need for him to tell Slytherin they've won and then take it away from them immediately.",

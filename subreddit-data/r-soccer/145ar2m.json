While he's a good poacher he's pretty limited in most other aspects of the game and that's painfully evident here. \n\nIf I compare to Zlatan, he had hold up play, he could be a threat in multiple ways. Hernandez isn't that guy and his teammates don't always anticipate his runs or movement in the way they need to. \n\nPeople thought he'd blitz it here, but in truth, I was never convinced. I knew he'd post double digits, but like most leagues, your top strikers are typically posting 25 upwards.",

He was always used in a 2 striker system and often came as a super sub in the late game in order to tip the balance with his positioning. He always had Rooney with him, who could drop deep for him and help him get the balls to score the goals. \n\nChicharito is a natural poacher. This means his main attribute, is his positioning. A very similar player, was Inzaghi for AC Milan. Limited talents, yet deadly and loved by his fans.\n\n\nIn short, Chicharito wasn't meant to score 25 goals a season. He was meant to score important goals for your teams.",

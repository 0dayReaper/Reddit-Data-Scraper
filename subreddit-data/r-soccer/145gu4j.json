Lecce was amazing this season and UEFA youth League is one of the worst youth competition by talent because of team playing just because their first team is in champions league. Next season the others Italian teams will be Lazio (that played in the second tier this season), Napoli (got relegated this season), Milan (avoided relegation by a small margin). Only Inter was almost in the playoffs but they still ended out of a qualifying position. Milan got to the semifinals in youth League this season while being a laughing joke in Italy.\n\nMaybe they won't do well because of players leaving, but the current team is miles better that most teams playing the Youth league.",

Are them all considered trained outside Italy or is part of the team foreigners that played in Italy for two years and are eligible? Only three players like you says seems terrible to me. For example Fiorentina 4 foreigners would have been eligible (if not for age reason) because they have been playing a long time in Italy. Also sorry if my comment looked aggressive, it's just that the current Youth league shit format is one of my pet peeve.",

But they would all be 'fuori quota' next year so they might be loaned/promoted instead of playing.  \n\nAnd don't worry about your comment, I agree with you. It's partly why Italy haven't performed particularly well in the competition, as the best academies usually don't get to compete in it.",

The two defense were perfect for 90 minutes with Fiorentina dominating the game but because of injuries to the strikers \"i Viola\" couldn't do anything in the last third. In extra time we were too tired and Lecce managed to create chance after chance and deservedly scored in the last second. Also really good job from the ref, a couple small wrong choice but unbiased and controlled the game.\nPS: It's a little sad seeing a team win the Italian Youth league without a single Italian playing in that team.",

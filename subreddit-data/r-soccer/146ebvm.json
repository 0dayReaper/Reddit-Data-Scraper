So Celtic earned 6 points this year (4 for qualifying to the CL, 2 for 2 draws) but for their country they earned 1.2 points. Motherwell and Dundee Utd were quite poor this season so they didnt get Scotland a lot of points.\n\nLiechtenstein only have 1 team competing so their points are divided by 1. So any point they gain means Liechtenstein gets that full point. And Vaduz did quite well this year in the Conference league (3 wins and 3 draws in qualifying; 2 draws in the groups)",

It doesn't take away any additional spot from any of the countries lower ranked than them. If they someday start sending a second team, then the country is no longer evaluated solely by the quality of its strongest team.\n\n&gt; To demonstrate how equal weighting is a bad metric to compare performance of 2 sets of different size, let's say each of Germany's top 8 clubs gained 11+10+9+7+6+6+5+5 points, compared to France's top 6 gaining 10+9+8+7+6+5. \n\nThe purpose of the calculation is to measure overall strength/performance of the country's league. Sending 8 teams and only being able to score 59 points is not better than sending 6 teams and scoring 45 points. \n\n&gt; Germany's average is lower than France's despite each of its team outperforms their counterpart\n\nThis is such a skewed perception. There is no such thing as \"each of its team outperforms their counterpart\" because it's not 1v1 comparison between each team. It's 1v1 as a whole country's league.\n\n&gt; and none of them was worse than the worst French team.\n\nThis is another skewed view because we can simply flip it around by saying \"The three weakest French teams score more points than the three weakest German teams so why should Germany keep on getting the 7th and 8th spot instead of giving the 8th spot to send a 7th French team?\" It makes no sense to compare individual teams.\n\n\nOverall, you just have to understand that it's the whole league of the country that is being measured. Not individual teams.",

The highest of those 8 is FC Vaduz. They competed in the Swiss Challenge League this season, the second division. Liechtenstein enters a single team to European competition each season by electing the winner of the Liechtensteiner Cup. A small quirk of the fact that only one team from the nation qualifies, is that their points are not divided. They count for full. So when Vaduz entered the qualifying stages this season and began tearing through their opposition, the points piled up fast, and they ended up miraculously making it all the way to the group stage of the Conference League.",

I may be incorrect here, but I'm sure the representatives from each country in European competitions are technically nominations/invitations by the FA. The rules that determine those nominations are typically league/cup standings, but so long as Liechtenstein are an FA in UEFA they should be able to nominate a team to play in Uefa tournament, so long as they can nominate a team which meets the requirements.",

They might lose Kim, but Kvara just signed a new deal and if someone forks up 150m for Osimhen it's a great thing for Napoli\n\n&gt; Milan no money and Redbird probably selling players\n\nBeen no news whatsoever about us selling any players. Just 2 days ago our only tier 1 said Maignan wasn't for sale, Theo doesn't wanna leave Milan, VERY few teams can afford Leao and of those teams idk which one of them *needs* him, and finally there's Tonali who's never leaving the club. Beyond these players, losing anyone else bar, maybe Tomori, wouldn't be a loss to us\n\n&gt; Inter 1 billion in debt and fire sale/half the squad\u2019s contract expiring/old age\n\nPretty much every tier 1 source for Inter has said they don't need to sell anyone this summer. From their starting 11 yesterday, only Dzeko, Acerbi, and Darmain are over 30, and two of them aren't starting for Inter next season\n\n&gt; Juve banned from europe\n\nThey pulled away from the Super League, they're no longer banned and with them being in the COL they should realistically farm that competition even better than Roma did last year \n\nLazio is a lost cause and I have no faith in them, but Atalanta has always done well in Europe even when they've been stinking it up in Italy. Finally, there's Roma in EL and there's nothing to suggest that Mourinho and Roma won't get far in this competition again",

Then you have all the other games they played in the league, and against our top 3. In the latter they either smacked or got smacked.

If Carrasco scores his last minute penalty against Leverkusen, Atleti would have finished 3rd and would surely have reached the EL final with their second half of the season form\n\nVillarreal also lost Emery in the middle of the season. If he stayed, I'm 99% sure that they would have won the Conference League, but instead Setien comes in who is terrible in Europe\n\nAlmost everything went against Spanish teams this year, which hopefully won't happen again.

Partizan are in qualifying for Conference League but are in shambles right now so they might not even qualify.

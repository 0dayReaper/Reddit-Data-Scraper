Cagliari fully deserved to win today, Caprile did all he could. \n\nCompliments to Cagliari, compliments to Mister Ranieri who is a true man of honour, after the game he even told Cagliari fans off for a mild \"Bari, Bari vaffanculo\" chant which I didn't mind really, but it was a nice thing to do. \n\nWhat he did after coming in is deserving of Serie A and there are some players that have the ability to keep up Cagliari in Serie A for sure next year.\n\nNonetheless proud of the boys, many players have gone above and beyond their level over the season. If we would've went up it propably was way too soon for many players and our sporting director Polito can't work miracles every transfer window, can he. \n\nIt would've been a disaster like Cremonese or Sampdoria but it could've been our disaster. \n\nAt least tickets and season ticket prices will remain low, right? Prepared for a nice season battling relegation with Foggia next season after some of the better players will leave but that's what supporting this club is all about.\n\nAnd stadium security won't be overwhelmed like today for big games, in Curva Nord a lot of people got in without a ticket after knocking down some fences. It was a bit overcrowded lol\n\nThe blackout comes at a good time",

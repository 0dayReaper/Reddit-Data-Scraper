Him and El Wensh being out with ACLs fucks us hard.",

Extremely sad ending for the captain after an amazing season\u2026\n\nThing is that he went on to complete the match despite the injury taking place at the 50th minute. However he didn\u2019t play the next match. This gives us hope that the news may not be true and he suffered a less serious injury. Either way, we wish him a fast and speedy recovery!\n\nEdit: [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/145adeq/okaz_preliminary_examinations_show_that_ahmad/jnkc3p1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_term=22&amp;context=3)",

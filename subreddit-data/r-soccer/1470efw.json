I have no problem whatsoever with Steijn becoming our coach. He never had players to play attacking football with in the first place. At Sparta he just looked ar what he had after Fraser made a mess of it and played realistic football. And besides that, 4-3-3 is beatifull if you have dominant players, if not it\u2019s an opponent\u2019s dream to play against with all the space they get.",

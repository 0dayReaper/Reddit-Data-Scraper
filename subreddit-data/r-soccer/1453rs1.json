Same goes for most other central/northern/western european countries. There's a lot of nuance as to why a lot of immigrants families from \"further away\" or some eastern european countries still identify more with their ethnicity (which is completely fair) or general national pride (which is also fair), rather than their citizenship or country they grew up in. It's mostly to do with failed immigration policies but theres a million other factors and its a pretty complex topic that doesn't need to be discussed in a football subreddit.",

If one would actually be honest and not racist, on first sight Gosens looks more German than Dutch or Turkish, while Gundogan looks pretty Turkish. But in any way, I think Gosens could outlast Gundogan for 90 minutes, but Gundogan would outsmart him. I had no ill intention when I replied to Chelseablue1896 (have no idea how to tag users)",

It probably feels amazing for Pep to have both Gundogan AND Rodri on the middle of the pitch, they read the game so well. As for Inter winning, I have massive hope, but it would take full 90 minutes of concentration and focus and hard work all the time. You cannot afford even a single mistake against this City, and I've seen our midfield and defense make A LOT of mistakes in Italy, and this City team won't miss those chances as some teams in Serie A did. I just hope it won't be a walk in the park for Man City",

Mostly because it's at a level where many foreign fans would probably not really consider it to be fully professional. \n\nI get that strictly speaking a 'professional football player' is just anyone who plays football as their main job/income. However, the average Dutch second division player makes a reported ~\u20ac35.000 euros a year, which sits around the same as an entry-level white-collar job. Moreover, it's an average, meaning that after taking into account some of the higher paid players, a majority of players will make less than 35k, which is far below the median income of the Netherlands.",

At semi professional clubs in The Netherlands players train like 3 days a week and have another full time job. Players at that level going even to the level of the Eredivisie is almost unheard of. It's an entirely different situation.",

The best way to translate it into english is youth academy. More literally it would be translated as \"youth performance centre\". According to the German FA, \"in NLZs talented and promising players are systematically prepared and promoted for professional football in a highly professional environment.\"\n\n\nAll clubs from them 1. and 2. Bundesliga must have an NLZ in order to receive the proper licenses to play in these leagues. Currently, in addition to the 36 licensed clubs of the two top divisions, eleven clubs from the 3rd division, eight clubs from the 4th and two clubs from the 5th tier run a recognised NLZ.\n\n\nNLZs were introduced to German football in the early 2000s in order to improve the talent pool. Most players from Gosen's generation and after went through an NLZ. For a german professional footballer to not have gone through an NLZ is an exception these days, especially on the level Gosens is currently playing on. \n\n\nNLZs have been credited for being a key factor as to why German football produced so many talents in the late 2000s and early 2010s and why the German NT won the World Cup in 2014. But they have also been criticised for taking the creativity out of youth players and producing pros who, while tactically disciplined and highly capable, lack the personalities and characters previous generations of players had. Critics of NLZs often liken them to sort of football factories, where the soul is sucked out of youth players to turn them into robots. \n\n\nRobin Gosens has so far given off a public image of someone who is the exact opposite. Which is why people often mention the fact that he never went through an NLZ as one of the reasons for his interesting, more down to earth and approachable personality.",

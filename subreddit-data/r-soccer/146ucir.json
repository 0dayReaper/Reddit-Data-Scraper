It'll discourage clubs like PSG giving out Mbappe a contract no other club can compete with. But Chelsea would have still been able to comfortably renew Kante. If players want to move to Saudi Arabia it's because the Saudi's are offering up to 10x more than what they could expect at a European club (salary cap or not).",

Calling it a retirement league shows you know little about the league and hurts your argument.

Players at the top of their game won't go to retirement leagues like that even with the money they're offering for the simple reason there's no competition. It won't change over time either for the same reason the MLS can't grow and has a clear ceiling as a competition. There's no international incentive for players to compete, just like the CONCACAF level is a joke the Asia/African level is a joke. Saudi might become a league full of talent and yet nobody will watch because it's an isolated competition. Outside of the bubble the level drops to 0 and nobody wants to watch that so there's no interest either for the bubble itself. As much money they can offer, players on their prime also want the visibility and the opportunity to compete among the best in a place that isn't ignored by the world. I mean, how much people are watching the Saudi league after Ronaldo joined?",

Man City's revenue for the last season was about $800m, not far off Dallas Cowboys revenue of $1.1bn. It'll probably overtake them in a few years given that overseas TV money in football is growing exponentially and Man City always manage to consistently have industry leading sponsorship deals (lol), but the value of the club won't be anywhere near that of probably any NFL franchise because they don't make much of a profit.  \n\nWhy is this? Man City spend close to $400m on wages, and probably another $200m a year on agents and transfers. Dallas Cowboys spend $214m on wages. They make $500m in profit per year. It's obscene. Of course, anyone would say that the players are getting absolutely fucked, taking brain damage and giving entertainment in exchange for peanuts in return (compared to footballers). But they have no choice. There is no other league with another model, there is no other country that even plays American sports.",

They only need the competition to generate more TV revenue. Teams in Europe have their origins in member-owned clubs that usually started out as non-profit organisations (most clubs in Germany are e.V. with an additional company for the pro team). We can criticise the big clubs for dominating their leagues all day long, but it\u2019s in many cases the result of much better club management and transfer politics over long periods of time. E. g. Bayern deserves their success because they were significantly better run over decades compared to other Bundesliga clubs. European Football might be flawed, but it\u2019s at least honest, brutal capitalism and competition with real associated risks if you screw up as a club. I prefer this system over the Sports Entertainment approach.",

Cap spending on the team, and the money goes out of the game and into the pockets of the owners.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I can't see why anyone would think that's good for the sport.\n\nBecause you're only looking at top teams, and only in the short term.\n\nSure, if a club earns 1000m a year and the owner pockets 700m, that's money not going to the game. However, with a change like this, the club won't be able to use those 700m to gain a competitive advantage by outspending all the competition, which means it'll win less and its revenue will go down. So that's less money for that particular owner.\n\nAt the same time, mid sized clubs will be able to compete and win because they get to spend similar amounts as the top clubs. They win more and their profits grow. Over time, profits will be more evenly spread out and every competition will be more competitive.\n\nSo sure, this restricts how much money teams can reinvest back into the game, but that doesn't mean the sport as a whole won't be better for it.",

Also if you support ffp, it'd be weird to not support caps as they'd probably protect clubs from going under more\n\n\nIf you don't like ffp, you prob wont like caps as it just gives bigger clubs more of an advantage because if you're getting the same money either way, why join anyone else?\n\n\nOther concern is how on earth can you impose caps over several different countries and economies? Sounds like a massive clusterfuck waiting to happen, us sports rules become insanely complicated due to how much they try to enforce parity and caps",

For example, each club debt is at max 70% of its annual revenue. Can't go bust if you have relatively healthy debt.\n\nFor example, Leeds and Rangers won't go bust if its debt is low relative to its annual revenue. If rich benefactors want to invest money into the club in the form of equity instead of debt, that is great news for the fans. Mobility can also be achieved instead of pulling the ladder that FFP enable.  \n\nThe new FFP of 70% cap wages/transfer on annual revenue is more of the same.

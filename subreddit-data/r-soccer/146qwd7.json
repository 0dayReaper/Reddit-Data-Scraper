As a Spurs fan I saw this first hand too many times. He was quicker on the ball than most players off the ball for sure. However he also deliberately would receive a pass and slow down the play completely to a halt, shape to go one way, then out of nowhere go from 0 to 100 in the other way. That was what he did a lot which Mbappe if we call him the closest equivalent to Henry today doesn't really do. Henry would use his balance and close control to beat defenders on the outside a lot too which hardly anyone does these days anyway. This may be seen as biased but I think Son is the best at going on the outside of full backs in the last few years because he is so good on either foot that he's not all about cutting inside and shooting. And he has caused Walker a lot of problems in the matches we've played against City over the years.",

A lot of defenders back then would trip or tackle you from behind with impunity.  Strikers today have it very easy compared to 20-30 years ago. That' s why you see all these insane goals/game ratios. When you scored 20 goals as ST in that period it meant something. Today it's not that big of a deal. \n\nFor those who have doubts you should watch some fauls on Maradona in the 80's. Haaland even said that he'd be injured all the time when he saw the kind of tackles players made when his father was playing 20+ years ago.",

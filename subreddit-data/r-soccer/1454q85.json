Laimer has been offered an extension from what I remember as well, he just wanted a step up and especially since he's Austrian, Bayern is a logical step.",

Laimer was presented with an option to extend his contract at Leipzig but then Bayern swooped in and of course he chose Bayern.\n\nGuerreiro and Dortmund had already agreed to not extend the contract. Bayern appeared afterwards (and the deal isn't even done yet).",

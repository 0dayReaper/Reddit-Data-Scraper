Shaw has played well as a lcb, Rice in the Rodri role, Bellingham in an advanced position, being able to utilize the likes of Rashford/Grealish and Saka behind Kane, etc. I'd normally doubt that Southgate will take that risk but imo it does fit the team like a glove. We still play 3atb in possession now.",

There were a few reasons for that - it was coached by Aragones rather than del Bosque, they had 2 striker at their peak for the majority of the tournament and it was the start of their domination so fewer teams dropped off against them. It was interesting though that this side probably had the most variety in terms of the make-up of the squad",

England aren't going to facing national sides who have players playing with each other for 1000s of hours of training week in week out. Even if such a freak team exists it would be like 1 or 2 and even that is overselling it.\n\nMeaning this is a low order almost trivial levels of concern. Besides previous user rightly said, the players are already used to playing in those pitch-regions so at least that part of the equation is done and this is of non-trivial relevance.\n\nThis is why WC exists on the hierarchy that it does. Sure club football may have higher relative sporting performance in execution but that is different to the construct of \"Being-Tougher\". Nothing in football is harder than WC because the pressure variable is off the charts and doesn't have an equivalent at club level where like Inter in this case, in like 4 months will start another UCL campaign, while someone who exists a WC may never in their life even get to play in another.\n\nMeaning the angle about \"Practise\" is oversold, even by coaches because they are greedy since it is indeed a competitive edge but it is not found in International football for all (except outliers like Barca-Spain, Bayern-Germany, etc for few short years)",

Darmian has never been a player to set the world alight but that inter all Italian center back 3 looked very very good, with and without the ball. A lot to aggressive tackles high up the field and pinged diagonal balls.\n\nCity\u2019s all 4 cb back line was also super interesting. They weren\u2019t exposed for pace second to inters forward line. \n\nReally great showing of the defense being the first line of attack, both back lines controlled the game.",

That's why Stones was pushed up to interchange with Bernardo between the right wing and the right half space. I don't think it was necessarily a case of Rodri having a terrible game but rather a concsious tactical decision by Pep to nullify the Inter press and in turn create an overload on the right side of the pitch and force Inzaghi to react in the second half.",

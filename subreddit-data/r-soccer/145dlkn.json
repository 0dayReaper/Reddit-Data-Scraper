In the same way that a Gerrard kept and undermanned liverpool in contention Kante played the perfect foil and link man for 5 years so all managers had to do was focus on their offensive positioning. He\u2019s amazing and if he leaves for a far Saudi pay check I honestly believe he deserves it more than most.",

But Busi was unpressable too (just type in \u201cBusquets unpressable\u201d on Yt). \n\nThing is: when you have an Iniesta that drops deep and can dribble past the entire midfield, with some simple one-two\u2019s from Xavi and you, the only thing you need to do is drop deep to create a triangle, and then position yourself to always be available for a triangle and pass. \n\nBusquets was the dustpan at the end brush that was the pressing. He\u2019s gotten a lot of flack for not being fast enough to track back, but he\u2019s always been very important for stopping counters before they\u2019ve even started. \n\nBut no one ever acknowledged how good Busquets was. Sure \u201cwatch Busquets see the game\u201d has always been popular to say, but very few people actually truly believed that Busi was one of the most important players of the team. Because everyone else seemed to be better at what they did. \n\nBut: much like Casemiro, Busquets full range of qualities only showed when he was no longer among the midfield he used to be. I personally was surprise to find out that Casemiro was in fact great at passing and shooting. The reason probably is: if you\u2019re in a midfield with Modric and Kroos, your main contribution is going to be defending wise. Sure you can do it, but others can do it better. \n\nThe last few years have shown that Busquets is great as a starting pass to build from the back. Everyone knows he\u2019s got a man in his back pressuring him and the only passing option is to pass back, but he always manages to still do that. The reason probably is that Busi also has shown on multiple occasions that if you do pressure him, he\u2019ll simply do a faint and embarrass you in slow motion. \n\nTl;dr: Busquets wasn\u2019t the best dribbler in the famous midfield of Iniesta Busquets Xavi, nor was he the best passer, and he\u2019s not the best defending Dm of all time either, but he was so good at defending that the other midfielder were more free to play to their strengths (Casemiro) while Busi himself could still play incredible long balls (Pirlo), receive the ball and beat the press (Verratti) and engage in tikkie-takka. \n\nBusquets in his prime was never the greatest of all time in any of these things, but because he could do them all at a really, really high level, it was as if he was 2 players at once, at least, he could fulfil the role of 2 players at once, which gave Barca the extra midfield presence that made them dominant. \nAnd that\u2019s why Busquets is one of the most unique DM\u2019s of all time, and in my personal option the absolute Dm Goat",

There was an article years ago that showed Jose Mourinho's scouting report of Barca and literally all he had written under Messi was \"foul him and don't let him get into space.\"\n\nGo back and watch La Liga from 2011'ish-2016'ish (especially El Clasicos) and you'll be appalled at how much they targeted Messi in the open field. Holding, obstructing, and taking his legs out on literally every dribble attempt... and they reffed him different. It was the reverse-superstar treatment. You could get away with tugging his jersey or literally jumping on his back in the open field and you wouldn't see yellow cards. Because if refs actually booked those open field holds, preventing any sort of advantage, half the teams Messi encountered in that span would've had to forfeit due to not having enough field players due to double-yellow'ing out of the game.\n\nJust got watch La Liga. He's consistently being held and pulled down and yellows just stopped being given. They literally couldn't stop him and refereeing had to adjust to keep the opposition from fouling out against him.\n\nI wish I was joking but people tend to forget how good he was in those years and I saw it plain as day that the typical yellow for holding or obstruction in the open midfield was left in the refs pocket more often than normal.",

They had a really low number of goals from direct corners, but always scored whenever they went short and looped it in, because the defenders naturally began to back-off.\n\nHe also noticed some other things. If they went short, then they left less players back, so if you won the ball back and sprang the ball beyond the midfield line, then you'd effectively have an entire half with which to run into. He also knew that the outlet for the short-corner always took three touches, so if you took the ball off him on his second, you could spring the attack.\n\nHe made his team work on dealing with short corners in the build-up. As a result, Bayern were able to counter from the corner and scored and the opposition were taken aback that someone had finally figured them out.",

But because he does, he can do all his tactical shenanigans. \n\nI mean, he switched Bernardo from right wing to Center mid, then tried him out at leftback. He\u2019s played Cancello right wing, rightback, leftback, and the inverted version of fullbacks. He\u2019s played De Bruyne as second striker, has had Rodri at CB and Stones at DM. He\u2019s played a year without a striker, with little problem until the CL (and even there the problem wasn\u2019t really a lack of a striker). \n\nMy point is: genius managers can\u2019t do shit with mediocre players. It takes a special kind of manager to keep a near relegation team from relegation, but it takes an even more special manager to not only take the best players and improve them even more, but to also create a team technically so good that he can change his entire line-up, or everyone\u2019s positioning, just because he thinks doing so gives the team an extra 10% chance of winning. \n\n11 Moneybags without genius won\u2019t win trophies, but neither will genius alone",

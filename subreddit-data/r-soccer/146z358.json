If they can keep him &amp; rely on home-grown players (or develop them as well as they have done in recent past) they'll definitely get back at top sooner than later since Zenit are heavily reliant on oil money which might not be as abundant in the future. Too bad silverware doesn't mean much anymore without European football.",

With all the talk about their money (and yes, they have more than anyone else), they still managed to sign top qualities players who can give results. While teams like Spartak, Loko where spending ~15mil on dudes who couldn't adapt and were awful.\n\nSo yeah, they might have money, but now they have less options. All the political stuff, no CL football, so yeah, South Americans are still gonna come, but you have to find next Claudinho or Barrios. It's not easy.\n\nGonna be interesting, if Zenit indeed loses a lot of their core guys, next season could have like 5-7 teams contending for the 1st, depending on the stuff thats gonna happen in the summer.",

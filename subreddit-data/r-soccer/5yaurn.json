The joy stems from watching a generally low-quality team refuse to give up and then come back from the dead against one of the greatest clubs in football history. You came to play, we came to play, and we were lucky enough to finish as victors after that insane rollercoaster ride. Respect is due to both the winners and the losers of that game (besides, you got your revenge not long afterward). \n\nThis game? PSG should be ashamed of themselves for what amounted to 90 minutes of cowardice and \"we're boned, guys, this is Barca...they always win.\" Compare that to a cramp-crippled Gerrard making last-ditch tackles out of position at right back, or Carra giving every ounce of strength he had chasing after anything in range, or Jerzy refusing to let the three he let in do anything to his confidence, etc., etc. Every man on that team played out of his skin that night. Even Jimmy \"oh god no don't let him on the ball\" Traore, for goodness' sakes.\n\nYour lot lost to side who wouldn't surrender. Barca just beat a side who were too terrified of them to even try and win.",

No urgency to clear balls, defenders just ball watching, and when they tackled in the box, it didn't seem like they were doing it out of a desire to win, but rather, out of desperation and the fear of losing. They were FOUR NIL up, and yet, it looked like they were the ones that had a mountain to climb. Atrocious defending. Nevertheless, that was a masterclass from barca, considering they had 6 minutes to score 3 goals.",

            "comment": "Hello people from r/all. Here's a description about the importance of the goal.\n\nThere's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where both team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the second game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away).\n\nThen, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1 in the 88th minute with only few more minutes left to play. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Still need 2 goals in basically 5 minutes. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play and people were hyped again and began opening their eyes for the last seconds. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance, and it really happened. Score Barca 6-1 PSG (PSG 4-0 Barca from first match), a total of 6-5.\n\nAll in all, no one expected an advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals.",

                    "comment": "Great post. Just to add.\n\nIn the Champions League there is an 'away' goals rule. So the visiting team's goals count for pretty much 1.5 if the score line is tied on aggregate (total goals over both legs) at the end.\n\nWhen PSG scored at 3-1 it made the aggregate score Barcelona 3 - 5 PSG as previously mentioned PSG won 4-0 at home. If Barca only managed to score 2 more goals to tie the game at 5-5 over both legs that would have meant PSG advanced due to getting an 'away' goal when they scored to make it 3-1 this leg.\n\nEdit: That goal at 3-1 should have put the game to bed for PSG but apparently not.\n\nEdit 2: The 'away goal' doesn't necessarily count as 1.5 goals. It was just a way for me to quantify the 'advantage' of the away goals if there was a tie in the score line. The away goals don't count for anything unless the aggregate score is a draw.\n\nHope I didn't make it more confusing.",

                    "comment": "I would make it even more comparable by saying that this is like a team blowing a 3 touchdown lead within the 2 minute warning. Barca scored 3 goals within the last 7 minutes of the match. 7 min in soccer is probably comparable to 2 minutes in football (without seeing a timeout occur after every play that is).\n\nSo at the beginning of the game it would be like blowing a 4 TD lead. But since Neymar's goal came in the 88th minute, they scored all three of their goals in the final 7 minutes of the game. Blowing a 3 TD lead under the 2 min warning is what this is like, which I don't think has ever been done before.\n\nBasically: throw a bomb for a TD as the 2 min warning passes, get an onside kick recovery. Bomb for a 2nd TD. Get ANOTHER onside recovery. And bomb for the 3rd TD in the closing seconds. Maybe a play or two thrown in there toward the sideline to try and inch your way up after the onside kicks, but that is pretty what this was. Oh and it's getting your hail mary TDs while the defense plays prevent D (PSG with 11 men in the box defending) on every play as you try to hail mary it every time, so no 1v1 coverage type shit. They are defending the end zone with their entire backfield each time you throw it. It's just unheard of.\n\nBut I think it's even crazier because I think scoring a TD is easier than scoring in soccer, so the 1 goal to 1 TD comparison is alittle off (which is why I said these TDs have to be hail marys rather than a 1 yard run or some dinky type of TD like that, but I won't get petty with the comparison). Shit is unreal no matter how you divvy it up.      ",

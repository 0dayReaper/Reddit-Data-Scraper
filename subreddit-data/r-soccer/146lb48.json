It can sound crazy if you've never seen how weird dudes act around them but seriously give women the benefit of the doubt when they say they have to put up with a lotta shit because my goodness do they",

And what bothers me as well is that I was in a relationship with her so obviously she felt comfortable letting me know somebody was harassing her, but there have surely been a lot of other women to whom I'm just another man and why would they turn to me if they're feeling unsafe. I do my best to run a tight ship, I keep my eye on everything and it's incredibly easy to read a woman's body language and tell when she's not about the drunk dude aggressively hitting on her but sometimes a bunch of my responsibilities cascade and I'm not able to watch everything like a hawk and keep the safe environment I'd like to.\n\nI'm sorry don't mean to rant at you, or make it all about myself when I'm not even the victim, it's just something that has been weighing on me a lot and has had a genuine effect on me. Almost radicalizing in a way. Like you see it and there's no other reasonable conclusion than something must be fundamentally changed",

The best matches are when there\u2019s an emotional tension between two clubs and fan bases. But City? It\u2019s just City, they\u2019re cute, they\u2019re new money and throwing their weight around begging to be loved but it\u2019s just kind of sad. I mean yeah, ha, funny Pep, good guy Pep, silly guy! And\u2026 cool. He\u2019s just the figurehead on top of this joyless husk of a club. If we play them again next year I hope we beat them but like, you\u2019re basically kicking a wall and it\u2019s boring. There\u2019s nothing there, these trophies are kind of meaningless when the winner is a meaningless winner. There\u2019s never going to be a real rivalry with City to enjoy, and that sucks. It\u2019s a sad day. City is  just an efficient, brainless steamroller\u2014they\u2019re just there, determined to suck all the fun away from everyone.\n\nEdit: Hey, this made r/soccercirclejerk so hate all you want, I am very happy with this post",

You are the epitome of the \"I don't care about City\" /r/soccer poster. You were even going on other clubs subs to chat shit lol. Cheers for the laughs!",

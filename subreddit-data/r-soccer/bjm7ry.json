He made his name with dribbling and quickly became one of the best finesse finishers. At some point he then decided to become one of, if not the best, passer in the game (while competing with the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Ozil and Pirlo). It seems like the last 2 seasons he decided he now wants to become the best free kick taker in the world and now he easily is. He also at some point acquired some of the best positioning, he is literally never offside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can one man be so talented at not just a few aspects of the game but basically every relevant attacking aspect.",

That's a very basic description.\n\nLots of it is down to genetic luck, practice and lots of it is having psychological fortitude to build on raw biological ability and continued development of an acquired skill.

I don\u2019t know much about Euro soccer, but if you feel so inclined, pitch your team and why I should follow/support them. My family is originally French, so a French team would be cool, but I\u2019m not interested in following a team backed by oil money. The team being French definitely isn\u2019t a necessity.

A working-class club that used to be good in the 90s and early 2000s and produced some big players, but they've bounced up and down between Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 (2nd tier) the last decade.\n\nThey appointed a new coach, Franck Haise in 2020 and since then they gained promotion to Ligue 1 (French top league) in his first season, finished 7th twice the following years, and just finished 2nd in the league just 1 point behind PSG (the team with Messi, Neymar and Mbappe you know). They've also qualified for the Champions League next season.\n\nThey're doing all of this while playing some super entertaining football and I believe the 11th highest budget in the league. Just a fun team to watch, who knows what they can do next year.",

All that matters when it comes to comparing squad price vs team performance is how much you spent on the players that are currently available to you. If one teams squad cost 250% more then they should be better even if the net spend is lower.",

Their backups are kind of uninspiring. Watkins has some kid from America in case of injury. Bailey and Buendia have B. Traore and Coutinho as backup. Traore was sent out of loan last season because he did not impress. And Coutinho was barely used this season. Ramsey is not a winger. That is not sustainable. Emery is risking his job I tell you.",

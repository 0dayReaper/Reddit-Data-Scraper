The only way this isn't really worth the fee is if he flops so hard he's worse than Chiquinho, which doesn't seem likely, or gets the worst of injuries, which so far he doesn't have a bad record of injuries. If he plays well we'll profit, potentially massively. If he's just OK and doesn't get sold, that's still depth in midfield for several years.\n\nI'll be thrilled if Schmidt gets proper support in transfers this summer. We don't want a repeat of Bruno Lage having to replace Joao Felix and Jonas with Chiquinho, which was a missed opportunity to challenge for more titles.",

I was totally convinced Aursnes would succeed with you, because he is just that kind of player: he comes into the squad and plays great at every position you tell him to. Kokcu needs to be used in a certain way to be effective. Arne Slot changed his preferred style to suit Kokcu, because he was our best player. \n\nI think if Schmidt uses him like he should, he will be great.

Anthony and Mudryk are examples of how clubs are willing to overpay on talented wingers but yeah, there\u2019s examples of midfielders as well of course but that\u2019s usually after big CL campaigns or in the case of Enzo winning the World Cup. \n\nIf Feyenoord wants to reinforce the squad for CL we too are under pressure to sell. After last year\u2019s summer we managed to fix our shortages from corona a bit but we still don\u2019t have much equity. If we want to be able to buy proper reinforcements (and even if we want to fix the fucking toilets in our stadium unfortunately) we are still under pressure to sell. \n\nCL money is good, but if PSV manages to pull through to the group stages it\u2019s about 15-20 million only I believe? And we won\u2019t get it before the summer ends. \n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s a big risk to deny K\u00f6kc\u00fc this transfer and hope a midtable PL team comes along later on. We can miss out on our transfer targets and piss off our most valuable asset. I had hopes for more but knowing that K\u00f6kc\u00fc has his mind set on Benfica, we\u2019re just a bit unlucky.",

Cesare Casadei, Andrey Santos, and Kendry Paez will be brilliant after puberty is done with them, but the rest are either shit or injured weekly.",

Clubs need to see our players perform on the highest level. So hopefully we can have a nice CL campaign (aka make it out of the groups) next season and not have fire sale the next summer, but get decent money like Ajax usually gets.\n\nOn the other hand, it also helps us a lot to get this transfer done quickly so we can finish our transfer business early this summer instead of at the end of August. That we way we can start the season strong and not relatively slow like this season.",

He also said he respected everyone's choice regardless of who they are but that he wasn't the right person to wear it due to his beliefs, you're completely twisting the meaning of homophobic.",

He wasn't being a representative of homosexuality, he was a representative of respecting people. If someone opted out against a racism campaign and said it's against their beliefs to respect black people, no one would question that's a racist belief. If you are against gay rights, you're a homophobe. You're anti-gay. It's only a strange definition to anyone who's not being dishonest and obtuse in order to defend a homophobe.\n\nHe decided to actively take the stance against participating in a token statement against the discrimination and forceful, violent, suppression of gay people. He's now the bannerman for the social movement against gay people, the hero for all fundamentalists out there who hate the LGBTQ community. Look for even a second for how those groups reacted to his \"neutrality\" to see how neutral it really was.\n\nAlso, I am so tired of the religion excuse. He wears a betting sponsorship on his shirt. If you only care about your religion's beliefs when it comes to being homophobic, it's easier to say you're just homophobic.",

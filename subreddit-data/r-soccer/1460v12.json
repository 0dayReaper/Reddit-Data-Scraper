He made a strengh out of \"his weakness\".\n\nWhat i love the most about him though is his technique though. He became a master of one touch play. It's such a pity we didn't get to see more of Griezmann and Benzema together. Those two speak [the same football](https://youtu.be/7GDt2sMUR3s?t=225). Such a joy to watch as a football enthisast...",

He could be playing in the right CM, he could be playing as the main focus at 9, he\u2019ll get back to left back position to defend and does a long ball, he\u2019s literally everywhere doing everything. One game he\u2019ll play on the right space doing whatever like dribbling the ball, the same game he\u2019ll be on the left space collecting balls from counter attacks. \n\nHe would genuinely be every manager\u2019s dream",

Stat-wise Griezmann won\u2019t be even close.\n\nHowever, Griezmann at that time was simply the perfect forward in a counterattacking system. And he did led Atleti and France to finals with the most outstanding individual performance. With Atleti knocked out MSN Barca as well. \n\nThough all of them are forwards, it\u2019s really hard to compare since they excelled in different system. In Barca\u2019s tiki taka Griezmann probably is worse than Neymar and Suarez, but on the other hand Griezmann is better in counterattack teams. I really think they peaked at the same time and 15-16 was such a blessing to watch with so many great players.",

When a player gets as many touches as griezeman does and assists, goals, shots, yards ran, dribbles as griezeman adds, it's easy to see his role outproduces a role on Barcelona that I will reiterate, faces the least amount of goalscoring chances than any team in the top 5 leagues (after they upgraded their defense over the summer) and commands the most possession within La Liga.\n\nTo me, it's very easy to see which player is 1. Contributing to their respective teams success more and 2. Which player is harder to replace within their system. The answer is unequivocally Griezeman to both those questions, thus I am taking Griezeman's season over Ter Stegen's without much if any question. It seems like most of the sports analysts and pundits feel the same way.",

The only trophies he's won in his career are the Europa League and the Copa del Ray. More than anything, his move to Barca was an attempt to farm trophies. Before we signed Griezzman we had won 4 of the previous 5 LaLiga titles. Atleti won the league before Antoine joined them and after Antoine left. We then won a LaLiga right after Griezzman left. It's hard being called the best player when you don't win titles. (Similar to Kane, he's been a top 3 striker for a long time, but you could never mention him in the same conversation as Suarez, Benz, Lewy and Aguero because he wins nothing)",

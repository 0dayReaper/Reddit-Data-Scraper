However, the website also references an article from an old Cadbury works paper, which states that the name came from the guard of the Italian king, which consisted of 99 men and thus anything really special or first class was known as 99.\n\nPersonally I reckon it's just marketing. And it works, everyone in the UK knows what a 99 is despite not having a clue why it's called that",

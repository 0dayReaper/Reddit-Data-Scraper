But it\u2019s not so much that we think a French ref will think \u201cI want ze Italians to win bc we are brothers\u201d. But more like a lot Europeans have this perception of South Americans that they\u2019re the lesser version of them, and in soccer that translates to people thinking they\u2019re \u201cdirty\u201d or cheaters. This is especially frustrating when the actual results and big ref/var calls tend to go against us. The 2022 wc was the biggest example I\u2019ve seen for uruguay in the last few years.\n\nAnyways, what most people think it\u2019s that refs either have subconscious biases, or genuinely believe that South Americans are more likely to foul or cheat.",

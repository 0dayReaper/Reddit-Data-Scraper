Imo Inter have the best manager but weakest (at least for the moment, we\u2019ll see how well Conte can get Lukaku playing, etc.) squad. Dortmund have a very very decent manager and a good squad, tho a bit inexperienced/raw, especially at the back. And Barca have Valverde who I just don\u2019t think would have the same reputation he currently has had he been at another club. He\u2019s able to get his teams to control possession which is actually impressive but they can\u2019t do anything with it and as that crazy stat posted on here a couple weeks back showed, rely way too much on Messi.\n\nBasically I think if any of Dortmund/Barca/Inter play with heart then they\u2019ll have a 50/50 shot at winning the game so this group stage could end up turning real brutal lol. I predict the first few rounds everyone draws each other as they\u2019re afraid to lose and then the final two rounds just be absolute bloodbaths as one team goes from giving everything to stay in the competition to then defending for their lives while the other team puts up everything they have, and then etc.",

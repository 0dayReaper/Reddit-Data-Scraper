There were many defenders who used to talk about it as a badge of honour kind of thing and there is still a fairly persistent thinking that a defender should put in a \"hard challenge\" or two early in the game to make sure the opposition knows. Back then fouls were not particularly punished so they got away with all sorts of stuff. \n\nAs things evolved, attacking players who are typically a little bit smaller than defenders, realising that they had a better chance of being protected if they fell over, started falling over.. and once it was clear it was working...almost everyone started doing it.\n\nIn the modern game the problem is that people will do virtually anything to win and these types of behaviours have not been punished (it's only been a few years that referees have started giving out cards for diving).\n\nWhat football needs is to have a post match review and to punish bad behaviours all around with a tribunal process like many other sports have.",

They feel contact and their body overreacts.\n\nI grew up watching and playing Australian Rules football, and I'd say it would be similar with those who grew up watching rugby, I feel I've got a pretty good handle on which injuries are actually bad injuries and which aren't. Studs in an ankle could REALLY hurt, but a bump in their back during a heading contest, or shit like this tiny contact on the bottom of your foot...I just look at it and think what a waste of time. There seems to be some code with commentators and some fans though where we all see some weak contact but, as long as there's contact, we all go 'that could hurt'. No it fuckin' couldn't. Look at it, ffs. If someone bumped into you on the street with that force you wouldn't even need a sit down.\n\nI came to this sport a bit later in my adolescence, and I really love it, but there are still some Aussie Rules instincts that I can't shake.",

The amount of yellows and reds when two players are trying to play the same ball and one makes more contact with the other.\n\nSometimes it's the guy who actually gets the ball and his follow through hits the other player, sometimes it's the guy coming in a fraction of a second later who gets the ball winner. The first is often classified as reckless, the second as a 'horror tackle'.\n\nIn reality, it's neither. Players can't tell within a hundredth of a second if they're gonna be first or second to the ball, and they can't tell exactly where their opponent is gonna put their leg.\n\nI know the response is, well if you're unsure you shouldn't put your leg in where it COULD be dangerous but, in the moment, all that means is you're giving your opponent an unchallenged ball.",

And the punishment needs to be severe, preferably escalating multiple match bans.\n\nAs for what could be done about faking injury, it is more difficult. \n But perhaps someone who spends more than a certain amount of time on the floor (maybe 15-20 seconds or something) should be forced to the sideline for 2-3 minutes until they can return, forcing their team to play with ten.  And it would work well for time wasting at the end of matches if that 2 or 3 minutes was added on to stoppage time if it happens during stoppage time.  I suppose you might have to give the player a pass if he was fouled though.",

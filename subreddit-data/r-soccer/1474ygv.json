His main job would be striker for one season and helping Bellingham acclimatise.\n\nAt Bayern he would be the Number 9 for four or five seasons.\n\nLet's say he spends four years at Bayern. That's 4 cracks at the Champions League with a top squad being continually refreshed with the best talent in the Bundesliga.\n\nStay in the Premier League and the best he gets is an infographic on MOTD saying \"most goals\" for a bit, until Haaland takes it.",

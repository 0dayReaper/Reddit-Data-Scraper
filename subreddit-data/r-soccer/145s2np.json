Apparently, he wasn't that fussed about getting playing time. It was nice if he did, but mostly, he cared about getting paid. Also, free stuff. My friend had boxes of trainers and tracksuits. His son got all kinds of shit from his sponsors and used almost none of it.",

I recognized the social anxiety that I have in him. At least that\u2019s what it kinda looked like at times. I think there is something much deeper going on than we know, and Alli not the type of person to divulge any details. \n\nI spent most of my 20s going from one severe/suicidal depressive episode to another, and it takes a toll on your mental/physical health, education, work, career, social life, productivity. It\u2019s hard to explain how damaging and debilitating it was. And also constantly changing medications so your brain is in a constant state of flux. Nothing works right, your thinking and memory is never clear. No focus. Why even plan for the next few months, week, even today If you have plans to end it. When that thought is there you have trouble finding motivation to even do mundane things or keep a regular schedule. And to add to that i also had to battle through two different substance addictions. Truly been to places mentally and physically I wouldn\u2019t wish on my worst enemy. The worst part is nobody can understand what you have been through except other people who have been through it. \n\nIt takes your brain AGES to work through these things, if it ever does. You have to get on the perfect medications and set yourself up for success with routines, healthy living, etc. and it\u2019s a tightrope walk just to get back to \u201cnormal\u201d. My sister went through similar adversity and hardship like me, and we talked about how all of this suicidal ideation, depression, existential crises, and panic attacks\u2014on a daily basis\u2014honestly kind of presents and feels like past trauma\u2014and you develop PTSD once you recover. It\u2019s embarrassing, you didn\u2019t go to war, or get shot at. You had panic attacks every day and were suicidal. But the cortisol and adrenaline plus a raging sympathetic nervous system is the same in your situation. Not to mention how profoundly depression affects the wiring and neurochemistry in your brain. Certain areas are neglected and atrophied for example. Just kind of a theory of ours though. Maybe we will understand the brain better in the next couple of decades, but it is a strange complex machine.\n\nAnyway long winded way of saying (and this is pure speculation) I think Alli may have a form of severe depression and/or an active addiction. I\u2019m really hoping he opens up on the problems he\u2019s faced some day. But in the meantime I feel like dogpiling him and the way the press treats him is gross. His trajectory would make much more sense if that were the case. He may be lazy in training but no need to impugn his character because of that. \n\n\nEdit** I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with Dele obviously, just pure speculation. When you have depression, anxiety, or addiction, it becomes easy to recognize some of the patterns of behavior that indicate something is wrong, and I see that in Dele fwiw. Just wanted to make a point that you never know what someone is going through.",

Can\u2019t imagine trying to cope psychologically with this if you already have other demons. Just hope he has some good people in his corner to keep him grounded. That\u2019s the toughest part.

I\u2019m nearing the light at the end of the tunnel. Sober for years, depression in remission, panic attacks and anxiety treated well. What nobody tells you is that it just takes time. Your brain has to rewire and restructure itself and that is a mighty slow process. The rebuilding process is when you are most vulnerable. You are like a turtle without a shell. You don\u2019t have that strong exterior to reject bad thoughts and decisions easily. But every day of stability, sobriety, and routine feels better than the last. Those three things are the key. And ironically after having been to hell and back with my own body and mind for so long, I finally started to find happiness and appreciation in the simple things. Thankfully that different perception/disposition and a good antidepressant, plus the occasional ketamine, goes a long way :)",

But his playstyle means he absolutely requires a high workrate, otherwise it is hard to keep him on the field as he's not the best at press-resistance and despite making some flashy passes around the box, he wasn't really the best at dictating the midfield as much as some of the top midfielders. And when he lost his engine, all his weaknesses became that much more glaring as he couldn't do much after Dembele left followed Eriksen and Alderweireld, all the while his defensive contribution became nearly none, though there were flashes of  great performances as a CM in the first few games w/ Nuno but still showed glaring weaknesses in press resistance and buildup. \n\nAnd then w/ the injuries &amp; the break-in &amp; shit I think mentally it affected his strengths - the daring flicks, the creative little moves and daring shots he made in and around the box - disappeared as his touch seemed to get worse (and also the loss of the explosiveness meant that it was harder to thwart off the defender as well).\n\nAnd apparently dude wasn't the most dedicated in practice, so it also played a huge role in this cycle continuing, many top players change their playstyles after injuries etc (just look at how Ronaldo changed throughout the years for example, as well as the Brazilian Ronaldo too after 2 major surgeries that would've ended many other careers) but Dele Alli just couldn't do that.\n\nJust a sad sad story overall honestly.",

Dealing with that, drinking and passive drug use the man is just going through shit like any fucking human. \n\nAnd people change their lives around all the time and turn into their best selves. It starts at the personal level, and I could see him making a huge career turn around if he decides to and becoming a top player again. It\u2019s so possible, and also very well might not happen.

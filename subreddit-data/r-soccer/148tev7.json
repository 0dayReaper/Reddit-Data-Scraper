    "postText": "For the past 48 hours, /r/soccer was closed to all users, with [our community one of the many who participated in the site-wide Reddit Blackout](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/144306y/rsoccer_announcement_regarding_the_planned/). The 48-hour protest was in response to the changes to the Reddit admins to their APIs, which will have a hugely detrimental effect on third party apps, and many moderation tools - all of which will make Reddit more difficult to use and access for many people.\n\nWe wanted to provide an update of the situation following on from the initial 48-hour lockdown.\n\nThose leading the protest against the admins see the next step as an **indefinite blackout**. This would mean the situation of the past 48 hours continues - nobody can access /r/soccer (or other subreddits in the blackout), and that situation will continue until the site-wide protest is ended (which would be when those leading it are satisfied demands are met).\n\nWe would like to discuss with the community, before deciding our next steps - here are a few key points to consider:  \n\n\n* There has been no official response from the admins (yet) regarding the 48-hour blackout. [A leaked memo from the Reddit CEO suggests they are content to \"ride out\" the storm.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759559/reddit-internal-memo-api-pricing-changes-steve-huffman) The planned changes are due to come in at the end of June.\n* Our previous poll indicated the community of /r/soccer would be willing to continue an indefinite blackout.\n* Whilst there was a strong movement for the initial 48-hour blackout (approx 10,000 participated) - the consensus on an indefinite blackout from our fellow subreddits is less clear, and at the moment a coordinated response feels lacking. However, **this picture may become clearer in the coming days and a clearer consensus may emerge.**\n* We have some reluctance with committing to an indefinite blackout, as this means we have no means of communicating with our users to gauge the mood on what action we should be taking.\n* Our priority as moderators in this situation is to protect are community as we know it. Reddit admins have the right to evolve the platform they own, but we feel our duty in this is to safeguard what makes this forum what it is and serve the interests of our subscribers - and hence will look to take the action that most enables this. It is difficult to know where the potential action of indefinitely shutting down /r/soccer falls into this - whether this will be the action that does force the admins to compromise on the planned changes, or whether this would not change their position, and hence have a detrimental effect on those who wish to use /r/soccer. \n\nPlease use the below thread for any discussion or questions. This is an unprecedented situation for us as mods and you all as the community - we want to make the discussion as open as possible, before taking the decision on how best to proceed.\n\nIn the meantime, we will keep the subreddit closed to submissions, but will be posting a Daily Discussion Thread, to enable some limited use of the subreddit whilst a decision is being taken. If the decision has not been made by Friday, Free Talk Friday will be posted. There will be no other submissions, aside from any updates from ourselves. \n\nThank you for your co-operation, and patience.",

What would happen if there was a massive account erasing for example? Like, millions of accounts ceasing to exist at once.

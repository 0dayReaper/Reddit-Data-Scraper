He was even worse when H\u00fctter played him as a RWB. \n\nThen we moved him to the centre and he was on a completely different level. In the past season, he was out injured for a long time and then Glasner refused to play him. Only at the end of the season, after taking a game to settle back in, he got to play again and did a good job. He was reliable when we needed him. We honestly wouldn\u2019t have won EL without him. \nI\u2019m sad he\u2019s leaving. I hope he finds happiness and more minutes at his next club. He deserves it.",

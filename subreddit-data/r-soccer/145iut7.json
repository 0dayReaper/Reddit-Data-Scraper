Not a lone striker. He'd actually work well with Scamacca I'm sure, as his link up play is solid enough and his movement creates space. \n\nI predict we'll sell Antonio, keep Scamacca and bring in someone like Gyrokes for \u00a320m or so and have him /  Scamacca on rotation.\n\nIngs we'll probably look to shift but will struggle because some idiot signed off on giving him 100k a week",

We were trying to adjust our style of play whilst everyone was out of form, had loads of injuries (1 CB for the first couple months) and had Europe to worry about (including qualifiers before the group stage). The pressure was mounting and the world cup just around the corner caused even more disruption. \n\nAfter Scamacca got injured in January we reverted to our old style to just ground out results. It wasn't pretty but ultimately Moyes kept us up and won a European trophy so fair play to him.\n\nI am wary of how next season will go but Moyes has form for taking a team from relegation to Europe in consecutive seasons as he's done with both us and Everton. All the factors I listed above  really do show how difficult this season was. I really hope he can successfully integrate Scamacca like he has with Paqueta and Aguerd. In any case, Antonio is getting sold so I doubt we're looking to sell Scamacca.",

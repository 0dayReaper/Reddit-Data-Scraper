Rodri is clear by a country mile right now but Fabinho at his peak between 2019 and 2020 was as good as Rodri is now, if not better. He played an integral part in consecutive 95+ point seasons and a CL win. He's not really an energy machine and Liverpool not having decent rotation options to give him enough rest caused him to regress after that. He had a great first half of last season as well but again was overplayed and started regressing as the season went on.",

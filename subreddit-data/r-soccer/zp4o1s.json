His Dad asked the coach, \u2018Why does Lionel always suit up on Fridays?. And the coach told him \u2018Because Antonella always comes over to our house on Fridays while Messi is playing with my son\u2019. When he was 12, he wrote in a letter that it was his wish to get Antonella to be his girlfriend one day, but then he moved to Barca and lost contact with her. They re established contact when her boyfriend at the time died of a car crash when she was 17. Lionel took the first flight back to Newell from Barca at 18, comforted her and the rest is history.\n\nShe was also originally going to major as a dentist, and comes from a family of well off supermarket chain owners. But when Messi\u2019s career as a footballer popped off, she transitioned into majoring in Social Communications and models on the side while being a part of his PR team to this day.",

Game was sold out and the crowd went nuts when he came on, but the fervor at the time was nothing like this. Literally all my friends groups are chatting about it, including ones who don't care about the sport. Furthermore, the fact our parents were able to afford tickets for all five of us back then, in comparison to what tickets are going for for the rest of Miami's schedule now, says it all.",

What the fuck are they doing.\n\nIt\u2019s the most embarrassing and hyper-Americanism name imaginable. It\u2019s honestly that exact kinda thing that makes the rest of the worlds football fans lack respect for US fans, they\u2019re getting painted with the brush of embarrassment",

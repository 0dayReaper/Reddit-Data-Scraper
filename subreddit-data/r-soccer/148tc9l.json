Robbie Keane did too and had a successful loan spell at my club from LA Galaxy in 2012 (6 appearances, 3 goals).\n\n  Robbie Keane is forever underrated. I watched him at Soccer Aid the other night and he scored 2 goals and was the best retired player on the pitch by far. (Including Totti, Crespo, Nani, Scholes, Roberto Carlos, Neville, Wilshere, Nani, Defoe, Cahill)\n\n  But I say Defoe because he actually went back to the Prem full time and still had a long career after with Rangers aswell.",

No football fan in England considers MK Dons to be a genuine football club, every single football fan from every club despises them. Relocated clubs in America are accepted as genuine clubs, it's just a normal thing and so common over there.\n\n  The MK Dons thing only happened because Wimbledon were traditionally a smaller club from a small area with a small fan base that were non league for the majority of their history. There are large American clubs that have relocated with little to no serious pushback from the public. \n\n  If even a mid sized 3rd tier English club (Let's say Bolton Wanderers) tried to relocate to London, there would be mass sized full blown incredibly violent public riots.",

But this how finals are decided unfortunately. One side note that don't get mentioned in this sub is that Pep learned how to manage those pressure games, pragmatism has caught up with him and that is the reason why City kind of rode up the luck in the final minutes.",

He got his starting tactics spot on and really had Pep scratching his head\n\nThey really could have used another striker option today. Dzeko didn't contribute much and Lukaku wasn't fit enough to start. Could have used someone more mobile next to Lautaro, and Correa isn't good enough despite fitting that profile",

Luck of the draw and other things massively plays a part in individual European seasons where the margins are so tight. They may have had many teams capable of making deep runs in the past who just didn't get the chance due to unlucky draws\n\nThis time, all 3 Italian sides ending up on the same side of the quarter final bracket and avoiding Real Madrid/Man City/Bayern alltogether was a pretty incredible turn of events",

Mourinho is on a wage of more than 11.000.000\u20ac annually, Mendilibar's 3 month contract was for 200.000\u20ac. Roma is the richer club between the two by any metric.\n\nSevilla is not a big club, it just seems that way to outsiders because of our recent success.

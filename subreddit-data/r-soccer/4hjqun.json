I've been going with him since then and he always used to tell me after another season of abject shite that it could be worse.\n\nI've never felt so much unrivalled joy as I'm feeling at this moment.

In my early youth (~60 years ago) on a Saturday, my mum &amp; I would take the train to Leicester - she would go shopping and I would go to watch the foxes at Filbert St. The train ride would cost 2/6 (two and six) return - 2 shillings and sixpence. The train line no longer exists, but the foxes winning the Premier League today brought back lots of old Saturday memories.",

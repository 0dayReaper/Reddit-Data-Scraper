They threatened companies like Sony Music to stop them from from working with my company, by threatening not to hire their artists for any events. They *just* did the same for the building contractor of a venue for a festival we're holding, and the builder had to withdraw less than a month before we open. \n\n\nThey often engage in sabotage when they feel threatened by another company, and their reach is massive since they own a lot of the venues that the Saudi entertainment sector, worth nearly $2b, operates in. They deliberately delay construction, mess with maintenance, etc, just to have some things taken out of a different company's scope and added to theirs. \n\n\nTheir margins are close to 900% due to these practices and muscling people out of the market, and its creating a situation where everyone has to work for peanuts under Sela as a subcontractor while they sit back and reap the rewards. \n\n\nIt's also around 50% owned by PIF, fuck Sela.",

You cant inflate sponsor ship deals anymore.\n\nThis deal is 25m per season. 7th in the prem, which to me is under valued for a top 4 prem team in the champions league. However, i assume Sela and NUFC are just 'erring' on the side of caution with the valuation to not spook the delicate and fragile egos of the 'sky 6'.",

There are a finite number of things people want to legitimately sponsor clubs for, but when they're coming from self owned sources, there are no limits to the number of things a club can get a sponsor for. \n\n\nI know that a couple seasons ago, City had something like 15 more sponsors than any other club in the league and that's where the issue lies.\n\n\nSo, there really isn't an issue with this kit sponsorship.

Because he is an incredible tactician and it would be great to see how far he can take an average squad, better than seeing how far he can take the best squad in the league. Like, could he do a Leicester? We'll never know but I want to know.",

We all know he can get it done on a rainy Wednesday night in stoke. \n\nWhen Guardiola took over Bar\u00e7a B they had been relegated to the 4th division and he brought them back up to third division in one season. \n\nAfter that he got the Barcelona job. Here is an article with some interviews of some of the players on that Bar\u00e7a B (and Bar\u00e7a C team), you can see that despite not having billions at his disposal his methods and his way of coaching was always elite. \nHe was literally running Bar\u00e7a B better than the first team so they decided to sack Rijkaard and place him as first team coach and the rest is history.\n\nhttps://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11096/11200400/pep-guardiolas-title-victory-with-barcelona-b-should-not-be-ignored",

Mou won with Porto but it was decades ago. No top teams even want to touch him now. Klopp won the CL on a lower budget but look at Liv compared to ManC in the last 7 years lmao. Tuchel won with PSG and Chelsea, which are among the poorest clubs in the world. His trophy caninet at  Dormund was full of aluminium and bronze trophies. Carlo won with Real, a mid table team who always struggle in CL lmao",

            "comment": "Translation:\n\n&gt;Jens H\u00e4rtel will be the new head coach at Eintracht Braunschweig. The 54-year-old football coach signs a contract until 30 June 2025.\n\n&gt;The former professional footballer (91 appearances in the 2nd Bundesliga for FSV Zwickau and SV Babelsberg) began his coaching career at Berliner AK before becoming head coach at 1. FC Magdeburg via RB Leipzig's U19. H\u00e4rtel was in charge of FCM for more than four years from 2014 to 2018, during which time he led the club from the Regionalliga Nordost to the 2nd Bundesliga. Most recently, H\u00e4rtel was on the sidelines at F.C. Hansa Rostock from January 2019 until November 2022, and he was also able to promote the Kogge to the German Football Unterhaus. He received his football teaching licence at the Hennes Weisweiler Academy in March 2011.\n\n&gt;\"During the talks, it became clear that Jens H\u00e4rtel fits in very well with us in terms of his approach, his substantive work and his sporting orientation. He brings the experience and the necessary clarity on the sidelines to develop us further in sporting terms. We are very much looking forward to working together and will get started straight away,\" said Peter Vollmann, Eintracht's managing director of sport, about the new appointment on the coaching bench.\n\n&gt;Jens H\u00e4rtel added: \"I'm delighted to become part of Eintracht Braunschweig and thus of a special traditional club and can't wait to get to know and work with the team, staff and fans.\"\n\n&gt;Jens H\u00e4rtel will be officially introduced at a press conference tomorrow, Monday at 1pm.",

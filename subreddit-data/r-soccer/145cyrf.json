Fuming that they're driving arguably our most successful manager ever out of the club like that, in a season where we will have to rebuild the entire fucking team due to our entire midfield trio leaving on a free",

Such a display of incompetence would be even impressive, if it didn\u2019t have huge repercussions on both Milan and Toulouse. But seriously, he\u2019s trying so hard to run both teams into the ground and piss off two different sets of fans, what the hell is going through his head? All those algorithms must have burned his brain cells permanently",

On this list, add Tyreek Mitchell, Kyle Walker Peters, Dwight McNeil, Lloyd Kelly, Jaidon Anthony, Cameron Archer, Curtis Jones, Ben Godfrey, Reiss Nelson (he is Jamaican, [not Zimbabwean](https://www.soccer24.co.zw/2023/04/13/im-not-from-zimbabwe-says-arsenal-star-reiss-nelson/)), Mason Greenwood ([he just recently rejected an approach](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11819717/Mason-Greenwood-rejects-chance-play-Jamaica-despite-seeing-England-hopes-ended.html)) or Rico Lewis. \n\nGuys like Sinclair and Gayle may have been worthy of this list 6 or 7 years ago but it's been a while and they're not really the players they were - Sinclair would only really have a chance to make our side as a central attacking roleplayer, and even then that's a tough call. Gayle would be a 7th or 8th choice up front at this point with his recent form.\n\nRashford, Sancho, Calvert-Lewin, Kalvin Phillips, Callum Wilson and Ollie Watkins were all eligible for Jamaica before becoming full senior England internationals (Rashford and Sancho qualified for multiple Caribbean nations through grandparents, including St. Kitts and Guyana). Danny Simpson, Jason Puncheon, Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer were all relatively recent fringe England players who could also have played for Jamaica but ultimately never played for anyone. Brennan Johnson and Ashley Williams became Welsh internationals but could also have chosen Jamaica.",

Ravel persists because, even though he is well beyond his peak and isn't even playing regular club football right now, he is just better at what he does in the center of the pitch than our alternatives. The next best player doing what he does is probably Tyreek Magee, and he's just started a new stint in the American 2nd tier (the USL) after years of barely playing in Belgium. \n\nAfter that, maybe Kenardo Forbes gets a look (USL) or Devon Williams (also USL, but more of a defensive midfielder). Both of these guys are older.\n\nThere are a couple of British born EPL U21 players (Delano Splatt at Fulham, Brandon Cover at Leicester) who could, if they play their cards right, seriously push for playing time in the senior side. We are *that* thin at this position. The domestic league just doesn't produce these guys. \n\nIf a guy like Lewis Baker would commit (he was approached recently and turned us down), he'd own a starting position.\n\nIt's tough, but it is what it is.",

This compared to Pulisic, Balogun, Reyna,and Weah.\n\nAll of Jamaica's 4 are regular starters in the EPL, which is the best league in the world right now. Pulisic and Balogun are both EPL players, although only Pulisic actually plays in the EPL. Balogun, Reyna and Weah all play regularly in top 5 leagues, but none of those leagues are at the EPL level (Ligue 1 is a significant drop off from the EPL).\n\nI'd call it a wash on paper, personally. Which is a lot more than I really ever thought I'd ever be able to say as a Jamaica fan.",

Reyna has certainly shown a lot more in the Bundesliga than Gray. And I\u2019d value Baloguns 21 goals in France over the combined 9 (17 if you want to add all four together) scored by Reid and Antonio in the PL. And Pulisic has shown that he can perform for the NT regardless of club form. \n\nAs I said for me it\u2019s quite clear but feel free to disagree",

It is definitely true that being in the EPL doesnt make you better than everyone else, but the average level is what it is - being a regular at that tier is significant, and generally requires more than doing so at other levels. Gray has shown he can be a solid EPL starter, which is more than Reyna has done so far (Reyna is also over half a decade younger so that chapter certainly isn't written yet). Weah (who, fun fact, could have played for Jamaica - his mother is from the island) still has a long way to go - he's a decent starter in Ligue 1 right now, but still seems to be finding himself at that level. Pulisic doesn't have anything to prove on quality but right now, his recent form at the EPL level has not matched any of the 4 Jamaican players. Balogun had a great year in France, but he still has to prove that can happen at the highest level. Plenty of strikers have put up prolific numbers in Ligue 1 only to come to the EPL and score 7 or 8 goals in a season. \n\nAgain, when you add it all up, I don't see a clear advantage for the USA here on paper as it relates to the comparison of these 8 guys, but that's just me. The Jamaicans are all substantially older, which is also a factor - theres a lot more upside in the American group. Obviously the ball is round and games aren't played on paper so it will be whatever it will be - the Gold Cup will soon be upon us.",

Obviously a situation where one player is a great starter on a top Bundesliga team and another is an ok starter in a relegated EPL side would be covered by that. \n\nThat said, taking a broad view, on average, the level of the league is a factor. Demarai Gray may be a merely decent starter on a relegation threatened side, but he was once viewed as a guy who was going to be doing a lot more. there are a lot of younger players in smaller European leagues who may hit the same ceiling come their arrival at his age. That's obviously something time will tell, but it's a factor here since it complicates the comparison.\n\n&gt;Otherwise we can talk about Aaronson if playing badly as a starter on the low end of the Premier League is so impressive in your opinion\n\nI was just comparing the big 4 we initially mentioned. if you want to switch someone out that's cool, don't feel strongly either way. \n\n&gt;It\u2019s especially not that impressive as they all count as homegrown other than Bailey. You don\u2019t see people congratulating Spanish players for making it to La Liga\n\nWe have about 2% of the USAs population (including the diaspora) and maybe 0.01% of the money. That this conversation can take place at all without being laughed out of the room is pretty remarkable, imo.\n\nThat's a victory in itself for me.\n\n&gt;Pulisic &gt; Reid, Balogun &gt; Antonio, Reyna &gt; Bailey imo. \n\nTo each their own\n\nWeah or Gray tho?",

            "comment": "Haverfordwest County AFC are delighted to announce the signing of striker Martell Taylor-Crossdale.\r  \n\r  \nThe 23-year-old has put pen-to-paper on a one-year deal with the Bluebirds, having most recently played for the Metropolitan Police in the Southern League Premier Division South.\r  \n\r  \nA product of the academy system at Chelsea, where he spent the vast majority of his youth career and played with the likes of Callum Hudson-Odoi, the forward was a prolific goal scorer for the Blues in the developmental stage of his career.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2019, he was due to join German outfit Hofffenheim, having flown out to complete a medical, but instead decided to make the move across London to join Fulham, where he would spend two years. His time with the Craven Cottage side included a short loan spell with Colchester United, before he linked up with Weymouth in the National League.\r  \n\r  \nThe forward, who stands at 6ft 1in, represented England throughout the age groups, featuring for every team from the under-16s to the under-20s, where he proved to be a goal threat on the international stage too.\r  \n\r  \nWhile part of the under-18s squad, he played alongside the likes of Mason Mount, Reiss Nelson, Japhet Tanganga, Andre Dozzell, Elliot Embleton and Jonathan Leko.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, his career has taken him to Gloucester City and Hendon, before he joined the Met Police in December 2022. His time at Imber Court was a positive one, as he averaged just under a goal every other game.\r  \n\r  \nMartell will now be able to tick European football off his list of achievements, as he links up with the Bluebirds ahead of our pre-season preparations. We look forward to having him on board for the 2023-24 season, which promises to be one of the most exciting campaigns in the club\u2019s recent history.\r  \n\r  \nCommenting on the signing, manager Tony Pennock said: \u201cWe\u2019re extremely pleased to get Martell signed. We had talks this time last season, however it didn\u2019t quite work out for one reason or another, but we managed to work things out this time around.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe\u2019s a player who has a fantastic record right the way through the England age groups, but for one reason or another had lost his way slightly in recent years.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we can kickstart his career again with us, and allow him to show the potential he certainly has.\u201d",

They are also heavily linked to Rice which means even if they don't get Rice they are still looking for _another_ midfielder. That would be five players for two positions. I'm really curious whats gonna happen.\n\n My guess is they'll try to sell Goretzka and they are pondering if a loan or sale for Gravenberch would be better. Probably depends on the offers coming in. \n\n Allegedly bayern is looking to offload many players which will be super hard because almost all of them are on extremely high wages and none of them performed during the recent 6 month (which is why bayern is trying to offload them).",

Can\u2019t go too wrong\n\nIn a very different system than what Bayern is playing. Tuchel's gonna play a rather static, position-bound system while Leipzig usually plays more fluid. That's where Laimer's great strenghts are, he's good at pressing over 90 minutes and runs down any gaps anywhere.\n\nBayern is much more in control of the ball without the necessary pressing resistance for it. They struggle with building up from behind because everybody and their grandmother knows that if they take out Kimmich, there's nobody left to process the ball. Then they can press, intercept and overrun Bayern's defense. \n\nI hope Laimer proves me wrong but I don't see quite yet how he's gonna fix these problems (which of course isn't his job alone either).",

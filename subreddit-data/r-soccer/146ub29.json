He\u2019s still making the same mistakes he was in his first season under Fonseca. This year alone he cost us at least three or four games because of his direct screw ups.",

I agree that he is mostly good, but I've seen too many matches where he's nearly perfect and then gifts goals or massive chances because of some brain dead decision. Very confusing player.",

Maybe stones but sotnes is playing in midfield.\n\nHe is a huge goal threat on every set. Great at tackels, very very fast and physical.  You will not find a profile like him. He needs to eliminate mistakes from his game. And he ain't old for a Cb a lot of time to learn",

You mention the portrait of Queen Elizabeth, Leibowitzs have pointed out that she used Photoshop in that work. She has even credited Photoshop with a rejuvenation in her own work.\n\nAnd, she doesn't take fashion shoots very seriously. This is a fashion shoot -- so it is indeed very likely this is shopped.\n\nAnd, if you don't believe me about Leibowitzs love of Photoshop, please Google: \n\n*Leibowitzs shoot of Keira Knightley and Jeff Koons.*\n\n Now, do you seriously still think Leibowitz doesnt use Photoshop?",

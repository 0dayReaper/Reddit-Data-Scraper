PALOSCHI!! Then there's Cutrone. Emerson, Okaka. \n\nThe fact is that you have to look far in the past to find examples. \n\n&gt;? They simply don\u2019t go abroad. \n\nAnd why is that? Italians somehow like money less than other nationalities? Clubs are simply sceptical of British and Italian players because their styles do not work well abroad. British players lack technique and Italian players lack creativity. They have too much tactics ingrained in them from a young age. Their style is too square.",

Just because you do not get called up does not make you a bad player. And restricting the argument to NT players is also pointless as they are not representative of league players. \n\nWhat are we arguing about here? Italian players struggle abroad. Not whether World class Italian players struggle, not whether the best struggle, but whether the domestic players in general struggle. The BuLi and the French league consistently have players who get good performances abroad before ever being called up. Kolo Muani is one example. \n\nSo restricting it because it sounds better in your eye just doesn't cut it here. These players did well in Serie A. They got a move abroad and flopped. Cutrone was highly rated when he was still at Milan. Balotelli had his best top 4 seasons in the Serie A. He scored there consistently. More than at City.You are are just talking nonsense here.  And Paloschi spent 5 years at Chievo. You are acting like those in Serie A right now who are scoring less than him are better. The problem with your argument is that you want to cherry pick who gets compared. And you want them to be top 4 players who played in the NT. So are the other Italians in Serie A a joke to you? We are comparing leagues here. So we compare all teams. And the players are listed were even highly rated at one point. You need to stick to the topic of conversation. Do not make up new definitions because that is just a straw man.",

He deserves credit for the 2006/7 title. Real even tried to stop his transfer to LA for his performance",

If you etched how he played at Madrid, he didnt very well. He can't be considered a flop at all.\n\nThe clown saying he's not in the top 200 Madrid players is absolutely deluded, I can only imagine its a 12 year old making those comments lol",

The PL has the lowest in the top 4. So a larger percentage of British players are playing in the 2nd division compared to other countries. \n\nSo you can't tell me that playing in the Championship has more incentive than playing at a mid- or bottom-table club in Germany. The championship clubs cannot offer more money than BuLi or La Liga clubs. They get less tv money than top 4 leagues. \n\nThe other fallacy in your argument is that you focus on the best British players. That is not a representative sample. Do French players who do not play for PSG mean nothing to this argument? \n\n&gt;So, you'd expect the \"typical\" British player abroad to be someone who's failed to make it domestically, so they'd also struggle elsewhere.\n\nYou need to make a valid argument to support that theory. Why is that only true for British players but not for German or French players? You are using double standards in your argument. I am talking purely from an empirical point of view. It does not make sense that Brits will rather play in the championship unless they are simply not equipped to play in other 1st division leagues. Only in the Championship do you see players scoring  15-20 goals and no club outside the PL is looking at them. Meanwhile, we have seen some PL go after the top scorers in Ligue 2. \n\nThe criticism of the British training system is not something new. It has been criticized internally. There is a sever shortage of coaches in England compared to other countries. British players have the worst first touches in the top 4. That is why even though they have the NT with the highest market value, they resort to playing defensive football. England needs to modernize their football. Otherwise, less and less British players will play in the PL. And putting quotas is not going to solve the problem. The problem is that there are too few coaches and quotas will just promote mediocrity. And everyone there will tap themselves in the back as if they are no longer the idiots that they are.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Capello is also known for his right\u2013wing political views, despite having previously been a self\u2013described \"socialist\" in the 1960s, and subsequently a long\u2013time supporter of the Christian Democrats; he was later a long\u2013time supporter of Silvio Berlusconi and his centre\u2013right party Forza Italia. He attracted controversy when he expressed admiration for Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in 2006 and the \"legacy of order\" he believed him to have left in Spain. He later distanced himself from these comments, however, stating that he did not intend to praise dictatorships. In 2002 he also admitted to having voted for the Northern Italian right\u2013wing separatist political party La Lega once in the past, as well as the Italian Socialist Party and the Republicans in his youth. He has rejected the label of a \"conservative,\" however, noting that he supported the trade unions, stating: \"I have great respect for all they have done to alleviate the exploitation of workers.\"[161][167][168][169]",

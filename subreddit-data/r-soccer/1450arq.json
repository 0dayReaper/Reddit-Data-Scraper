TikTok was about 500k (estimate based on Wrexham's financial disclosure), and that was based solely on Ryan Reynold and Rob McIlhenny's clout. \n\nUnited also tends to only get involved with blue chip properties, such as the US Olympic teams, NFL football teams, NBA arenas, and the PGA (well, we'll ignore that last one now). So this is a huge get for Wrexham, because it isn't just the money, but the prestige.",

Not for league 2.\n\n3m sponsorship can probably be approved by the secretary to some junior marketing person.\n\nThis is Ryan Reynolds and the thing is going to be seen by probably 10 million people between the matches and the TV show. And then Ryan will wear the Jersey (probably) on big US talk shows etc.\n\nI dont believe this would go for less than 5-10 million ultimately. \n\nMaybe theres problems with FFP with doing that becusae the underlying club is in League 2?",

And then you get Neville (G) on Sky Sports talking about stability and stuff like that being important yet he's on the board of a club that have gone through 4 managers in 3 years as they think they can just get promoted again in a hurry, despite already being promoted four times in the nine full seasons since they took over the club. Plus him and his brother using the links with Beckham and Lim to get managerial gigs they're clearly not cut out for and wouldn't get in any other circumstances.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not particularly bothered with all the Wrexham stuff, but I can at least get why it excites and engages some people. Salford though? Pfff, rich retired ex-pros playing irl FM.\n\nE: FYI /u/SpectaSilver991 /u/Lenyngrad didn't want to just copy paste this to every reply.",

Foster is now the certain #1, Lainton for cups, and Howard as back up if anything goes wrong.\n\nI wouldn't worry about Howard too much, he's benefitting from being at this club as well with his own podcast.

Plus he joked about not being good enough for Newcastle and being a stiff old man. Would have likely been a very short term thing due to injuries to their other keepers. He already retired once. He only came out of retirement because Wrexham are a perfect match for him. \n\nI'm not entirely convinced. People underestimate league 2. Of course the standard is lower but you get some great players coming through. They usually come up and move on, or they come on loan and then go elsewhere, but at any given time there is a sprinkling of real quality in the league. I watch league 2 every week usually, I wouldn't expect him to automatically be streets ahead of every other keeper at 40 years old.  \n\nWill be interesting to see how he gets on anyway.",

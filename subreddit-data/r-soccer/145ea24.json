If you take that away, he would have played 34 games and \"only\" had 9 goals. \n\nTrue, but why would you take that away. Overall he did gather 11xG, so while there was slight overperformance, it's not wildly unsustainable.\n\nAnd we've gotta take the adjustment period into consideration too. He scored 2 goals in his first 13 games while adjusting to LL, and then 11 goals in the remaining 21 games.\n\n&gt; Taty prob isn't better than En-Nesyri \n\nThat's true, he's probably not displacing En-Nesyri there. But a club of Sevilla's level would be a reasonable landing spot for him rn.",

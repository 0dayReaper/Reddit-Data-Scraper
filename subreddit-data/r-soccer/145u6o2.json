And then comes a certain Zidane and scores two goals.\n\nThen there was this goal: https://youtu.be/XsZkCFoqSBs\n\nI actually remember that match, though not that goal. What's also funny is we're actually living close to the Dutch border and may have picked up Dutch TV via antenna. I'm sure we watched the German coverage, though and I assume our commentator wasn't quite as excited as his Dutch colleague.",

If you were a kid aspiring to be a GK, you had a Kahn jersey. If you made a great save you referenced Kahn just as any sweeper keeper action today gets referenced to Neuer.\n\nHe played on top level for two decades. In 2002 he single-handedly carried an awful German team (that would do fuck all at the Euros two years prior and two years later) to the WC final.\n\nTop 5 seems fair to me. Neuer and perhaps Buffon are ahead of him and then there are some legends like Jashin, Zoff or Banks in the mix who I didn't see play but are widely regarded as among the greatest ever.",

            "comment": "With the CAFA (Central Asia) Nations Cup and the SAFF (South Asian) Championship being held this month and the next, I wonder if AFF should consider organising the AFF Cup at the middle of the year. This is considering the issue of teams not getting their best players for the cup due to it being held at the end of the year, at a time when the leagues in Europe are still ongoing. \n\nAlso, considering how both of the aforementioned cups invited teams from outside of the region, maybe AFF could invite one as well so that all SEA teams can properly participate. AFF have 12 teams but Australia never participated in the cup so the worst two teams would have a play-off to determine the final team, leaving the losing team unable to compete in the proper tournament. Of course, if a team is invited then AFF may have to scrap the home-and-away format unless the invited team are close enough to SEA.",

The only reason it got shifted was because they didn't want to clash with the World Cup qualifiers.",

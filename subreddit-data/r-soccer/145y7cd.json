            "comment": "&gt; Teddy Teuma is being linked with a lucrative move to French Ligue 1 side Stade Rennes, reports in the international media said.\n\n&gt; Eurosport journalist Romain Collet-Gaudin announced on Wednesday that the Malta international is expected to leave Belgian side Royal Union Saint-Gilloise and make his move to French side Stade Rennes.\n\n&gt; \u201cTeddy Teuma should sign for Rennes,\u201d Collet-Gaudin said, without giving any details of the transfer.\n\n&gt; Teuma is coming from another excellent campaign for Royal Union Saint-Gilloise, which saw him amass 52 appearances, netting 14 goals and providing 17 assists.\n\n&gt; The Saint-Gilloise captain is tied with the Belgian side until 2025 but it is understood that although the club is keen to keep the 29-year-old midfielder, it is unlikely that the club would stand in his way if he receives a lucrative offer for him.\n\nI personally as a Maltese would love to see Malta represented in a top 5 league",

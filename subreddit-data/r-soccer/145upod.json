Guerrero then Grifo are the worst rated players in that team and Schlager should not make it due to amount of games missed. \n\nGuerrero is there due to lack of quality left back alternatives. Grifo they seem to have wanted a left midfielder. \n\nWould make more sense to have Shkiri and Kimmich over Schlager and Grifo.",

But guerreiro legit just feels like half a football player no matter how you play him (even if that half is borderline world class).\n\nThat being said, he'll undoubtedly be an asset to Bayern. For example, I could see him be more of a backup that they can bring from the bench on various positions when they are playing against a very defensive team that they fail to break down (something that has not come as easy to them as of late). We never really had that luxury due to our dire lack of depth on the fullback positions",

Since it's the job of a proper 6 to balance their defensive duties on all sides which allows for more flexibility and stability as a whole. In other words, your CBs and FBs can make runs forward and shift position to the side of the ball and your midfielders can press more intensely and play more aggressively.\n\nBut with Guerreiro as one of your 8s your 6 will have to be absolute world class because otherwise I don't see how they'd be able to do all that while having to constantly clean up for him ...\n\nThat's what I meant by \"half a player\". The amount that others have to compensate for him is far above average imo and *it will cost you* to the degree where it can negate his attacking prowess on average over a season.\n\nSo what is his best position? I'd say a wingback with a back 3 behind him because that way there *are* enough players to clean up for him while at the same time he doesn't have to play as a traditional winger. Though I don't think that's a formation bayern is going for with their focus on the wings",

For two years now Bayern's 8s, Kimmich and Goretzka haven't been able to arrange that one of them stays back when the other one moves forward. \n\nBut Guerreiro won't be more than a rotational player anyway so when and how he plays will depend more on the game situation than the underlying tactical system",

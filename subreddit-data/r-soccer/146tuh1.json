I Mean the biggest thing holding back Saudi Arabia are their archaic laws like no alcohol, insane punishment for small things like being with a unmarried women etc. I'm not going to go there just cause Neymar plays there since it's still run like a country in the dark ages and I doubt this somehow boosts it too,I really think this is just a massive dick swinging contest when they waste so much money since there's no way this translates to a return of investment from tourism since they're massively overpaying it. Paris tourism didn't massively increase just cause Neymar and Messi played and it won't happen to Saudi arabia too. Miami isn't going to see a insane windfall just cause Messi is going to play there",

For example, ads for Pepsi or Coca Cola sometimes have little to do with their own products. The ads are sometimes about people having fun and whatnot, and then they show their logo at the end. They hope to instill subconscious idea into people's minds. I think it could be the same here. If some people would start thinking about Ronaldo instead of oil or archaic muslim country when Saudi Arabia name comes up, that's already a win in their eyes.",

The plan they presented was in order to register players they couldn't register last season (or just couldn't register their new contracts) + Messi and new signings. Without that approved they can't register a single one, not even if they were playing for 1$.\n\nAnd the plan includes offloading a lot of players, lowering the salaries of others, and a lot of other things.\n\nWhich is why Messi didn't wait. He'd have to wait around until the end of the transfer window, and then he could end up in the same spot as when he left Barca for PSG. Without options.",

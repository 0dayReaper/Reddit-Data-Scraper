Probably saw his chance to become a Ferguson / Wenger type character who ran the entire show. What he wanted to do was probably correct, but too much too soon. A huge shame though, what a likable guy he was!",

They sugar coat Ranieri's statistics by using the date he was hired(23rd of December) rather than the date he started working (1st of January). Cagliari won their game between these dates.  \n\n2. Cagliari were joint 12th with 2 other teams on 23rd of December. They probably checked tables that ranked Cagliari by GD and goals scored, in which case Cagliari would've been 14th. In reality h2h matters first, and Cagliari beat both Benevento and Modena earlier in the season. Official tables would therefore have them 12th rather than 14th.",

It doesn't need any visionary mind for that, just the balls to do it. Having Schmidt's input surely helps as well.\n\nJury's still out on Rui Costa and the board, but this plays clearly in his favor. He may actually believe in it and \"had his hands tied\" in past, or just doing it for PR so that he stays in power longer, but can't really ignore that lots of things changed for the better.",

            "comment": "Mixed feelings about this. Very happy for him and I don't even care that much about the ridiculously low direct fee (25M with 5M add-ons). In 1 or 2 years benfica is almost certainly going to sell him for 80+ million even if he is at exactly the same level as right now. We'll get our money, and it's not like we directly need more. \n\nThe thing that really sucks about this is that even if he only stays at benfica for 1 year, he'll just be recognized as another amazing benfica talent instead of a Feyenoord talent, even though he's been at our club for 9 years. We need some more recognition as a club. On top of that, it's kind of a slap in the face for the Eredivisie in general that even though we've overtaken the Primeira Liga, the POTY is moving from the Eredivisie champions to the Portuguese champions. I know Benfica is bigger than we are but actively making a Portuguese club that competes in Europe better is not ideal for coeffici\u00ebntenpolonaise, especially since it could also influence other eredivisie talents' career decisions in the future. Idk, maybe I'm overthinking it but that's what bothers me the most.",

And Benfica also have Jorge Mendes in their side and that help can't be understated. Take into account this fact: Benfica have sold Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix and Enzo for 120M\u20ac each; have sold Darwin Nunez for 100M\u20ac (I think) and going back 10 years, they sold Witsel to Zenit for 40M\u20ac. Feyenoord's record sale was last summer - Luis Sinisterra to Leeds for 25M\u20ac.",

He has had immense games tbf, but also a fair few where he single-handedly threw the game.\n\nIt also helps to know the context of Benfica's GK record since 13/14: Oblak, J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Ederson... then a 1 or 2 dark years with the likes of Varela and Svilar for example. But Benfica was used to top keepers, and Ody has been here for 5 years and he's still not really what the fans like from a keeper. He's decent, but... eh. Benfica fans are ready to move on and bet on someone else.\n\nAs for Kerkez, seems the deal is dead, not sure if reports that Kerkez rejected the salary offer is true, but AZ seems to hold on to the 20M\u20ac valuation, which Benfica won't match. Lodi seems to be the latest rumour. Think this one will also be a hard transfer to make.",

Sure, he is very talented, but there are some weaknesses in his game that make me doubt that he will be sold on for the really big bugs. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something Benfica fans want to hear about today. Congratulations to him and Benfica for a great move.",

Aursnes filled in this role perfectly when they played together. He is absolutely not a 10, but more a low playing playmaker. \n\nHe took all our corner kicks and they were terrible. \n\nHe is a hot head and will be provoked a lot in the Portugese league. \n\nTo end with some positive points:\n\nHe is great at shooting from outside of the box. He has insane vision, can accelerate  the  play and can play insane balls out of defense through the lines. \n\nIf he develops under Schmidt he can be a 80 million player, but there is also a real chance you sent him to a midlevel Spanish team on loan next year. This move also is kind of a gamble for Benfica.",

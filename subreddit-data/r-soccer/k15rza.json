Our economy wasn't right, the democracy was in jeopardy everyday, but we had him. \n\nI lost my dad in 2018. As time passed, I've noticed a few things that I've shared with him were slowly dissapearing: places that have changed since, politicians who had retired, players in our starting XI that he never saw.\n\nToday I feel like a lost a little bit more.",

My family was talking about how they used to see those matches of Napoli and Argentina and ofc my father's First Wc experience being the 1986 Wc, he thinks that that Wc had an intensity that the later Wcs couldnt generate for him. Even though Argentina came painstakingly close to winning the wc in 2014(my first true wc experience) Baba felt like nothing could top '86 for him. Same for me this time being the 2014 WC. This was a great loss for the Calcuttan  Argentina fans as he was their God. RIP to one of my idol's idol.",

Terry Fuckwit especially, \"Oh I'll pretend to make a challange and just fall over\". The bellend.\n\nShilton getting out jumped and missing the punch was on Shilton, and what was that crap attempt at a clearance all about, set ourselves up to fail with that one.\n\n I dont blame Maradona for cheating, you see all kinds of cheating and gamesmanship in everygame played, you've got to be able to reset mentally and play the game. We're too salty about that goal, and have found something to bitch about in every tournament since. \n\nFor the record Maradona is one of my faves, once I grew out the childish \"Cheating Argie\" mentality and really looked at how bloody good he was.",

There's photos of him with Chavez while wearing a shirt calling Bush a war criminal.\n\nI suspect the Argentina sub leans heavily to the right and represents the richer elite of BAires.",

Specially given how fierce the rivalry between Boca and River is portrayed.\n\nI'm just curious because of how a similar situation with Eus\u00e9bio's death was handled here at Portugal. I think non-Benfica fans in general acknowledged Eus\u00e9bio's importance as one of the greatest footballers ever (and arguably the greatest Portuguese footballer bar Ronaldo), but still a lot of fans of Sporting and Porto showed little respect after his death. The ultras will even mock his death sometimes during matches against Benfica.",

He wouldn't hold praises for River Plate players if they were good.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen he retired from the National Team, Ortega (a River Plate player and fan) who was the guy that had to wear the number 10 right after Maradona retired from the national team, always mentions that Maradona called him to support him and he was always giving public praise to him.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was the same when he coached the national team, at the time Mascherano (identified with River Plate) was playing for the national team and Diego said some like \"Argentina is Mascherano + 10 others\". So I think Diego made pretty clear that for him Argentina was more important than Boca. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUs River Plate fans appreciate him a lot. Some people might mock his death, but if that happens that would be more related to his controversial personal life than for his Boca fanatism.",

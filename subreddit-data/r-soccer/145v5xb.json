It's an honour for me to lead our team as the captain on\n&gt; the field for the Champions League final tonight. You Cityzens have been\n&gt; there for us all season. Without your support, we wouldn't have been\n&gt; able to have the success that we've been able to accomplish.\n&gt; \n&gt; And tonight, we go out there on more time and fight for the badge on\n&gt; our shirt. For our city. For all Sky Blues. For all of you. I'm very grateful\n&gt; that you came together to watch us play in the final tonight and I hope\n&gt; you keep your fingers crossed for us once again.\n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to write you this letter to let you know that you are a true inspiration for me. Your strength, resilience, and zest for life are truly awe-inspiring. The challenges you face on a daily basis require immense courage, and your ability to overcome them is remarkable.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that life can be filled with obstacles and uncertainties, but please know that you are not alone. The bonds you have formed at Community Integrated Care, the laughter you share, and the support you provide to one another are testaments to the strength and beauty of our\n&gt; community and the human spirit. Let's continue to build a community\n&gt; that celebrates inclusivity and compassion.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all\n&gt; the employees of Community Integrated Care. Your dedication and outstanding work are truly commendable. Your efforts enable people to lead\n&gt; fulfilling lives and reach their full potential. Your professionalism, compassion, and empathy make a tremendous difference in the lives of many\n&gt; people. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your exceptional\n&gt; work and the positive impact you make in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; It's been a pleasure to have celebrated my birthday with all of you guys\n&gt; in 2020 and 2021 - it's been great to have spent this time together. I\n&gt; cannot be with you tonight and watch the UCL final together, but as a\n&gt; little present and to give something back, I have plenty of food and\n&gt; drinks for you guys. Enjoy it, have a good time tonight and I hope to see\n&gt; you soon!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; C'MON CITY\n&gt; \n&gt; All the best\n&gt; \n&gt; Ilkay",

It is only eaten with tomatoes, pickles and optionally lettuce. No sauces and in only pita bread or lava\u015f (tortilla). It is amazing. \n\nDont get me wrong, they are both good but they are just different dishes imo. There are a lot of places that make german style d\u00f6ner in Turkey now and Hatay D\u00f6ner is very popular in Turkey as well, it is from the city of Hatay on the border of Syria, it is made with chicken and a lot of tomato sauce, mayo, french fries, tomatoes and pickles. That one is amazing as well",

Germany is known for their bread, it's a noticeable difference. If you get the wrap version then the difference is less noticeable (or not at all)\n\nThe meat is debatable.  I've find the Turkish version is more flavorful but maybe Germans like to taste more of the natural meat flavor.  It's really up to personal preference.\n\nThe German version has a lot more veggies than the Turkish version.  I guess it depends on how much you value veggies, but I like having that freshness and the quality of veggies is quite good in Germany.\n\nFinally, the sauces.  Maybe you think it's overkill, I like it with the different sauces.  I don't think it overpowers it at all.  It's quite mild in taste other than the spicy sauce, and it adds a bit of fat to balance out all the veggies.",

Syria, oh well, and Morocco is very nice but imo kinda touristy in many areas (also politically that too is what it is). There's also Egypt or Saudi Arabia etc but *personally* I don't like the food as much, but that's highly personal taste obviously.\n\nFor me, after Arabian dishes come the vegetrian Indian dishes, and then those from South East Asia like Malay. Lots of meat in the local cuisine there too but due to various reasons there's a load of vegetarian ones too (at times a bit more niche maybe), and I always prefer the \"dish is vegetarian\" over \"meat dish without meat is vegetarian\" foods.",

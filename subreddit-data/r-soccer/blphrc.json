There was a point where I was in complete shock at how he would make pin point accurate passes without even looking up before making the pass. That's when I decided to zone out of the rest of the game and just watch Messi for a bit, and I realized he looks up waaaaaay before the ball even gets to the person that's gonna pass to him. He basically scans the area and knows what he's gonna do before the ball gets to him, so he doesn't need to look up again once he has it, he just executes right away to perfection. Worse part is that game is probably one of the matches nobody will remember from him, since he didn't score and also since he has had so many masterclasses. He has geniunely normalized greatness in football.",

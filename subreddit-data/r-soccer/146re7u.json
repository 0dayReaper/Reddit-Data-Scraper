The fact is that many great strikers scored a lot of goals because they got into scoring positions a lot, but they also missed a lot of good chances as well. But getting into scoring position is an immensely valuable skill for a striker, probably in many ways more valuable than their level of finishing (granted there's minimum levels needed). After all, in terms of creating chances it's usually a result of the quality of the supplying player(s) and the finishing player, like a good through-ball and a perfectly timed run.\n\nThe fact is that Lukaku has been very good towards the end of this season, even if we probably have to say his total season has been quite disappointing. When used correctly and when he's in form, he's absolutely a top striker, and I agree completely with you that yesterday his performance was good. \n\nIt's a shame that history often is remembered by single moments that stick in people's memories more than the overall career of a player. Like Roberto Baggio, possibly the greatest Italian (offensive) player of all time, is in the mind of average football fans probably mostly remembered for one of the most iconic penalty misses in the history of the game. A very special player with an exceptional career, haunted by a single moment that frankly could happen to anyone.",

It's more important in basketball because it's so much more one on one and getting past players you need the burst of acceleration all the time. And then you also have the dunking part.\n\nYou also use Owen as an example, a lightning quick striker, and Townsend as a winger. They need their pace and quick acceleration a lot more than someone like De Bruyne in his position.\n\nDe Bruyne can adapt into whatever role would fit him, he's done it numerous time in his career already and this won't be the defining moment either (in my opinion)",

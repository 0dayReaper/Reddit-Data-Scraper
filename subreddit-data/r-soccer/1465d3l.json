Mount for 70-80 mil with 1 yr contract.havertz for 60-70mil for whom they payed a little more than this asking price. But he was at his peak when they brought him and been very average in his tenure , with 2 yr left don't know if he justify the value. Colwell with 2 yr contract left and when brighton offered 40 mil , they think it's a laughable offer and quote cucu transfer a yr back. Chelsea went into a bidding war with City and payed that price for the player of the season of Brighton, he might have gone downhill but at the time of purchase they just payed a little more . Chelsea may see him as a  starting 11 player in the future but at this moment he is not starting player for them  so he doesn't justify 70-80 mil which they payed for fofana who was a starting 11 for Leicester and had a long term contract.\nIan Maatsen- 2 yr contract left, never played in pl , not a starting 11 material for Chelsea. Burnley wants him for 15-20 mil but apparently they expect 30-40 mil . We have to wait and see how kovacic,RLC,pulisic transfer plays out.",

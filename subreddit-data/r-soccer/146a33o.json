Chipping it in isn't as simple as it looks, and you have to have the technical competence of the GOAT to pull it off in a high-pressure situation like that of and at that angle. I like Lautaro, but he is not Messi, and there's never been any indication he has those gifts. Had he tried and failed in that situation, he'd be rightly criticized for over estimating his abilities.\n\nYou've clearly not been watching the sport for a long time or played much if you believe that sort of nonsense.",

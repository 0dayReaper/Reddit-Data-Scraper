No accountability, no regulation, no fan input. I feel like it's the most visible manifestation of the UK being a willing playground for the ultra-wealthy and a place where reputations can be laundered and dirty money can circulate no questions asked. I think that's the state of the UK beyond football. It's most places, but the UK is pretty bad for it.\n\nYou know when you want some tax-dodging, fracking billionaire you probably wouldn't piss on if he was on fire to buy your club because morally he's actually the *lesser evil* the situation is waaaaay out of hand. And it's not going to get better.",

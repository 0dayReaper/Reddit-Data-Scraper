That means ban for clubs on structuring and bans for players and managers for backhanders.\n\nIf a hypothetical club were to say \"we'll give you an extra two hundred grand a week to sign for us, but it has to come from our owner's cousin's business that only has a PO box and 1 employee\" the player has to weigh that up against a ban from playing and anything he wins being stripped. It would also eliminate a lot of the agent backhanders as well.",

Pep only joined in 2013, so he only had a year in Bayern. Germany's football was nothing like Pep's tiki-taka and wasn't possession based at all - rather relied on energy and pressing, in spirit I'd say it was a lot more Klopp-like than Pep. A midfield of Schweinsteiger and Khedira is very far from a Pep style.\n\nThe only Pep influence I can see is Low trying Lahm as a DM, a move that clearly failed as the team reverted back to Lahm at RB before the knockouts. True they had a bunch of Bayern players, but Pep's effect on them after one season was still minimal (as Muller and Schweini struggled to adapt), and the style was clearly the same thing Low played since 2010.\n\nEngland is also debatable. Pep has some clear influence - Walker playing RCB is a huge one, Stones improving too - but the English style is very far from Pep possession too. Midfield of Rice-Belilngham/Phillips would never fly in a Pep team. Most of the key players and spine - Kane, Saka, Rice, Shaw, Trippier, Pickford, previously Mount, even Maguire - have very little to do with Pep, while his guys Foden and Grealish haven't really established themselves as key players to England. I really struggle to think of when England used \"4 City starters\".\n\nSo I'd say Spain was clearly modeled after Pep, England has some influence, Germany almost none.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m a bit done with all these premier league fans playing the victim of City\u2019s sports washing, while draining all other leagues of quality players. I\u2019m not defending City\u2019s dubious practices, but it\u2019s a bit hypocritical. City doesn\u2019t *get* the money legally, but they *spend* the same amount of money. \n\nAnd you know what they do with that? Draining other leagues of all their talent. I\u2019m Dutch and the whole league is basically a training league for premier league talents on loan, or for Ajax players, trying to make an impression to transfer to the prem. Ajax itself has basically become a middleman (a true Holland classic) for buying talents, making them big and selling them on. \n\nI know the Eredivisie isn\u2019t a big league and eventually anyone that\u2019s truly class will move on, but the last decade it\u2019s been moving faster and faster to the point where our whole league is basically the shopping window for 3 clubs. \n\nYou know how long Luis Suarez played in the Eredivisie? 7 Seasons! (2 at Groningen, 5 at Ajax). That\u2019s longer then he was in either the prem or in La Liga. Eventually he moved on, but until that time we could enjoy him. \nAntony played 1 season in the Eredivisie. That\u2019s an extreme, but it\u2019s more common then staying 4 seasons. \n\nAll Eredivisie players transfer to the prem, and for what? Most of them transfer so soon they aren\u2019t even developed enough to guarantee themselves a slot in the team. They\u2019ll just warm the bench alongside 20 other talents from different leagues, because anything that looks promising is yet immediately bought away. \n\nThe Manchester clubs are actually 2 of the better ones in that respect: city buys nothing they don\u2019t truly see playing as a starting player sometime and while it might take a season, most transfers do play (Ak\u00e9 for example).\nUnited on the other hand is in the middle of a rebuild and so mostly does the same (also a Martinez is basically guaranteed playtime when Maguire is the alternative). \n\nChelsea is one of the worst, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that Chelsea buys players that just aren\u2019t good enough, that the players simply can\u2019t make the leap, or that Chelsea just can\u2019t get the players ti work in their system. But either way, players like Ziyech, Madueke, Zakaria and previously Werner were all wasted. \n\nAs a matter of fact, the last few years the Prem has had as big of a hand in buying away players from Bayerns competitors as Bayern itself. \n\n\nI know my rant will probably fall on deaf ears or elicit a response like: \u201cwell it\u2019s inevitable, the Premier league is simply the best league\u201d. \nBut that\u2019s just simply it: like city is the best team in the Prem because they spend the most, the premier league is the best league, because they spend the most. \n\nGetting second in the Champions League final will get you more then \u20ac100 million. You know how much a recently promoted EFL team gets? \u20ac110 million! Promoting from EFL to CL gets you more then a 3rd or 4th place in the CL! \n\nSure, it\u2019s because it\u2019s fair to the promoting clubs, because how else are they supposed to compete with the other big clubs. But as a result, the amount of money in the premier league is simply ridiculous. \n\nYou know how big the prize money is for winning the Eredivisie? Well, technically 0, as the KNVB doesn\u2019t do prize money for first place. You get a bigger share of tv-rights money, which means something like 9 million. In total, the Eredivisie has 74 million of Tv-rights money to divide between 18 clubs. No the big money is in reaching the CL, which gets you at least 15 million euros. \n\nAssuming you consequently lose everything and end up 4th place, the Eredivisie winner gets roughly 25 million. A relegating premier league team will still get \u00a395 million in the season they relegate and \u00a344 million the first season in the EFL. \n\n\nThe English Premier League has too much money. Compensating promoting and relegating teams only inflates the league more. Bigger transfer sums mean nothing within the premier league, but increase the gap with other leagues. Players like Antony and Mudryk go for 100million, while a player making a lateral movement, like Kokc\u00fc to Benfica will go for 30 million (probably 45 if sold to a Premier league team). \nThe quality of Premier League football increases, but the quality of football literally everywhere else decreases alarmingly fast. \n\nI don\u2019t like comparing the Prem to the Saudi league, but ethical issues aside, moving to the prem is the European equivalent of going to the desert: it\u2019s just too much money for clubs and players to pass on. \n\nAnd with Premier league teams having so much more money, there is no reason not to buy 25 promising players. Because if 5 of them actually become true class, they\u2019ll still have bough them cheaper then waiting until they\u2019re class and then buying them. \n\nAnd I know it\u2019s been going on for a while and that La Liga was the dominant league for a long time and it did more or less the same, but the sheer scale at which the premier league does it is frightening. Players like Ziyech who would be considered the best in the Eredivisie aren\u2019t even playing. \n\nTl;dr: English football has too much money. I\u2019m sorry that City is using the FairPlay rules to wipe their ass, but they\u2019re the leaders in a squad depth and especially squad width-equivalent of an arms race. Leaders. As in, the most prominent offenders, but not the only ones. \n\nThe entire premier league is ruining other leagues by buying their quality players after 1 good season only to then store them on the bench. The best players in the world play in the prem? Fair. The second best play occasionally and are on the bench most of the time? Fair. But why do the 3rd and 4th best players also need to sit on the bench, or with the reserves?\n\nCity does illegally what the rest of the premier league does legally. And I think it\u2019s time to stop pointing the finger at city as if it gives yourself the moral high ground.",

You helped me realize it's like the reason a player like Bellingham can't come to Liverpool even if he wants because he is established at the highest transfer n wage brackets (at the age of 19). Where does the market go from valuations like that. Thats why as u said, teams will take risks on younger and younger players as prospects because if they blow up most teams get priced out quickly. Ultimately I want to think there are too many good players and managers in the world and enough intangibles in football that the EPL etc can't saturate and soak up all the top players endlessly. (But I fear I'm wrong)",

They don\u2019t spend a fraction of what Man Utd, Chelsea, West Ham or Arsenal spend but somehow everyone is convinced they are buying 500m worth of players every transfer window. \n\nThe main advantage of the UAE takeover was giving them a jumpstart and then investing in the facilities and the City Football Group (both of which they haven\u2019t exactly been taking full advantage of yet). After the initial jumpstart they basically became self sustainable in terms of transfer market and no further investment is needed there. You can\u2019t convince me a team that basically wins the league every year, plays in Champions League every year and has access to the PL TV money can\u2019t afford a -260m net spend over a 5 year period without having to be heavily bankrolled",

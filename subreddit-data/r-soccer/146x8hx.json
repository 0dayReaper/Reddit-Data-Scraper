Also you might actually be able to get rid of Umtiti(or at least a big chunk of his wages) since he had a great season in Serie A\n\nMessi going to Miami might even end up being a small blessing in disguise, surely the last thing Barca needs right now is more high earners taking up salary space. They need to rebuild with a younger team",

But transfer fees might be the more problematic part... But I'm not really sure how it's calculated in the SCL, so idk. We will know for sure in the incoming 2 months I guess.",

Marlon Gomes was supposedly desired by AC Milan in the start of the year but now that the club has changed after Maldini\u2019s departure who knows if they\u2019ll go after him.",

Damn.\n\nEDIT: 55 minutes in, the post has already cracked the 200 mark, officially 286th.\n\n1 hr EDIT: One hour in and the post is at 234th, marking a 52 place jump.\n\nEDIT 3: 1 hr and 5 mins in and the post is placed within the top 200 (197th), if it gets too big will catalogue from r/all.\n\nEDIT 4: Rising even faster now, officially 168th.\n\nEDIT 5: Nothing much to add on except breaking top 150. (138th)\n\nEDIT 6: As the post has to fight against 10k posts, it appers to be plateauing at 123rd.\n\nEDIT 7: An hour or so in it's fighting for top 100 (108th). \n\nEDIT 8: Post at 101st, but more importantly beat out the 6-1 thread (105th).\n\n**EDIT 9:** The post has reached the top 100! Currently 98th and shows no signs of stopping. \n\nEDIT 10: Currently 89th, and above the release clause post.\n\nEDIT 11: 77th right now, nothing special to say.\n\nEDIT 12: 72nd, plateau possible?\n\nEDIT 13: 68th right now, plateau is on :(\n\nEDIT 14: If you want to fuel the effort, then this is your chance! The post is sitting at 66th right now.\n\nEDIT 15: It's at 63rd currently, I think it will make it to top 50 at most.\n\nEDIT 16: Thread is picking up traction again, 58th currently.\n\nEDIT 17: 53rd right now, plateau is mostly over but #1 is highly unlikely.\n\nEDIT 18: 51st, top 50 99.6% likely at this stage.\n\n**EDIT 19:** Post is staying at 51st! I repeat! Post is staying at 51st!\n\nEDIT 20: Post is now 47th! This is a pretty big milestone because just under is the \"Chelsea win the PL\" post.\n\nEDIT 21: 46th right now, marking the slowest possible uptick. Won't become top 10 post as people were predicting...\n\nEDIT 22: 45th. Slowly but surely we are getting there. Competition from above is \"Hazard destroying a kid post-match\" and [ADO den Haag goalkeeper equaliser in the 94th minute vs PSV](https://streamable.com/axco).\n\nEDIT 23: 44th. Will be suprised to see it in top 30.\n\nEDIT 24: 41st! Pretty impressive compared to the army level crawl that we sat through for the past 20 minutes.\n\nEDIT 25: 40th. Back to where we are apparently.\n\nEDIT 26: 38th. Just above it is the match thread for 2014 WC Final, just under is Vardy's scorcher against Liverpool. You can tell we're heading to legendary status.\n\nEDIT 27: 37th! This has really suprised me. I really thought this was the limit but they keep on going just one more.\n\nEDIT 28: 34th right now. This is where the fun should end for the thread. The 29th most upvoted thread has 22k, meanwhile the 30th has 20k. Slow times are ahead.\n\n**EDIT 29:** The post is stuck at 34th, just like my prediction. Really want it up after 17 excruciating days, so sorry if I look like a Debbie downer.\n\nEDIT 30: 32nd, with 600 upvotes needed to move up one spot.\n\nEDIT 31: 32nd still, and we might see a bigger number in edits than post number.\n\nEDIT 32: This is the slowest crawl I've ever seen. By now, the post gains 200 upvotes per 5 minutes so next time should be higher. (32nd obviously)\n\nEDIT 33: Still 32nd. I actually refreshed multiple times to see, but nope. If it reaches top 30 within 10 posts will continue, otherwhise not.\n\nEdit 34: 32nd looks like the biggest it can get right now. I think it's frozen.\n\nEdit 35: I legit think it's frozen. It's been stuck on 20K for 5 edits now.\n\nEdit 36: Second to last edit if it doesn't advance.\n\n~~edit 37: Well RIP. After 17 days of will he-won't he Neymar's record breaking, almost law-defying, lawyer involving, Pique lying, standard setting, Qatari funded transfer bonanza is finally over. And so is my quest to see it's placement.~~\n\nEDIT 38: IGNORE WHAT I WAS SAYING. I WAS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER SO THOROUGHLY REDDIT BROKE. AFTER REFRESHING I FOUND THE POST IS NOW THE 19TH MOST UPVOTED POST ON REDDIT. MORE TO FOLLOW.\n\nEDIT 39: [Proof that shows I wasn't lying on the 32nd placement.](http://imgur.com/t5IVYcS)\n\nEDIT 40: This will be my last update as I feel all people who are interested have already upvoted. Will return one last time after the UEFA Champions League/Europa League draw to see if anything changes. \n\nAll in all it was a semi-succesful post, but I feel that it should have been a top 10 post, so a slight underachievement, but not like the 32nd I mistakenly I thought was the number.\n\nEDIT 41: If you're still interested in what I have to say then this is for you. The post isn't even a day old and it's in the top 5. I won't cross out the 40th edit because it's actually true this time and who knows what will happen within a couple of hours, maybe it crosses the top 3, but absolutely not #1. The amazement of Leicester's victory is something not even Neymar's transfer to PSG can overcome. \n\nMy over and under estimation was clearly shown throughout the history of this and it shows a real curve in how much every higher spot gets more and more important. For comparison when I first posted this the post it was 388th. The current 388th is [Deja vu ... Wenger having the same season again and again](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5te047/deja_vu_wenger_having_the_same_season_again_and/). The post above it, [The Worst Goals of the Season Compilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6e8u4g/the_worst_goals_of_the_season_compilation/) has only 30 more upvotes. This explains why the post jumped up 102 spots within 5 minutes. Little competition from the posts allowed it to move up faster. Another important factor was that when it became clear /u/guisasolaa 's thread was the one to break the news, a massive surge occured. If it was any other post from the top 100-200, it would have made big leaps, but nothing compared to 102 spots up.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a 2,500 point gap between the [4th post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5yaurn/barcelona_61_paris_sg_sergio_roberto_905/) and [6th most upvoted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6goyl5/michael_bradley_goal_against_mexico_01/) which shows why the post hasn't improved recently, bigger gaps. Another thing that doesn't help is all Europeans on r/all or browsers of r/soccer have most likely upvoted this post without enough interest from Americans. According to Google Trends in the past 30 days, Neymar is a hot topic in Brazil, West Africa and Western Europe. Not a single city in the US is interested in the transfer, which means that a small fraction of people who upvoted this were American. Considering that reddit is mostly American, it makes sense that the post wasn't upvoted by people browsing r/all, they most likely weren't interested.\n\nIf there is more interest, I will make a follow up post.",

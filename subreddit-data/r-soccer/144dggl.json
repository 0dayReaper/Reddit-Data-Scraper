Not just to get free kicks but seemingly to try and get players sent off with all the rolling around on the floor. Imagine not being that into football and watching that, you'd quickly turn away from the sport! I started the game kinda wanting them to win, but quickly changed my mind as a result. \n\nNone of that excuses the fans that threw stuff of course.",

A player is considered to have made their body unnaturally bigger when the position of their hand/arm is not a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player\u2019s body movement for that specific situation. By having their hand/arm in such a position, the player takes a risk of their hand/arm being hit by the ball and being penalised\n\nI get why it was given but it was kind of a natural motion. He was running with and battling with his arms and ended up hitting the ball. That's why I consider it harsh\n\nEdit : that's up to interpretation tho. Either actively trying to deflect the ball OR it was just a natural running motion and he got unlucky",

Have your mate stand in the middle of the pitch, and have him shout 'go' when he's ready. What you need to do is then sprint at full speed from one corner to the opposite corner. As you cross the pitch, have your mate push you over. As soon as you get up, you have to start jogging around the pitch again. \n\nDo this a few times and see how long it takes you to get up.",

But we never, ever screamed in agony, rolled around like a fish out of water, trying to get players booked and sent off. That takes more effort than just getting up again lol.\n\nCheating is trying to con the ref. That is what they were doing all game. Benny did it and deservedly got a yellow. Half Fiorentina's squad should have been booked for faking serious, life threatening injuries that required surgeons, ERs, morphine and emergency care.\n\nOr they can just wince, sit down a second or two, then get helped like most players.",

If that's not enough for you, have them randomly take your legs out, or shin you, and you not only pop right back up, but you do so without a sound of pain. \n\nThe screaming in agony is usually a response to being caught badly, and then you're straight up lying if you can say you'll get caught by studs and happily run on. \n\nThe premier league is a rougher because we don't apply the rules as strictly as other leagues when it comes to fouls. But a simple rule is you don't go down when fouled and you dont get the foul. \n\nEven looking at the final, Antonio got his legs taken out, and it wasn't called as a foul because he pulled himself back to his feet to stay after the ball.",

If he only faked a concussion there's a decent chance Fiorentina would have been the **UECL champion** now, UEFA probably would have given them a 0-3 win due to that absurd incident.\n\n\nPeople probably underrate the gravity of it because of Biraghi light reaction but a Napoli player did what I suggested in 1990 at minute 80 in a decisive game for Scudetto when the result was still 0-0, second last game of the season.. As a result Napoli got the win and then proceeded to win the Scudetto, 1 or 2 points ahead of AC Milan",

So in a way, they didn't fail to control them once it began. It's not like security and such can tell the future. BUT, this seems to be the stance leagues and governing bodies take these days regardless.",

Objects were thrown everytime a fiorentina player was anywhere near the west ham goal, and it only stopped once the fans knew they would get in deep trouble if they continued doing it. \n\nGiving credit to the West Ham players calming them down is an absolute joke because they only cared for their own sakes, not out of any sort of sportsmanship or respect for their opponents.",

It's a **very** serious problem, especially when you start to deal with death(s) that occur directly in your line of work. If you can't depersonalize that feeling, you're not going to have a good life, and you're going to burn out very quickly in that line of work. Medics especially have a high burn-out rate, and high PTSD rates. It's unfortunate, because all you want to do is help people, but taking your work home with you can ruin your career, and it's incredibly hard not to.",

Which actually brings up a question for any firefighters that might be in here: are there different levels of urgency in calls going to firefighting stations? As in, if someone calls in about a cat, is that relayed to the dudes in the big engines the same way as if someone was dying in a house fire, or is there a 'ok guys no need to risk anything by driving like madmen on the road, it's just a cat' setting?\n\nEdit: wow, lots of responses there, thanks for the information!

Response levels for medical calls go through EMD which gives prearrival instructions to the caller and also sets a level of response (basic, advance, intercept, multiple units, etc).\n\n\nI've worked in all areas of public safety (fire, emergency management, police, and dispatch manager) over the years, most on fire and emergency management though. \n",

If it's another department calling for a \"lift assist\" because the patient is too fat for 5 grown men to lift, then we are going to take the extra 5 minutes to drive there normally.\n\n\n\nIf it's an address that we've heard a million times and know it's not a real emergency, then we tend to slow things down, even if protocols dont tell us to. On the other hand, if we hear the mayor's address, we speed things up. (I got called to the mayor's house because his grandson stubbed his toe. Ended up cleaning his yard while we were there.)\n\n\n\nAlso, the \"cat in a tree\" cliche doesn't actually happen.  As my old chief use to say: \"I've never seen a cat skeleton in a tree. It'll find a way back down.\"\n\nI did get called for a kite in a tree once. Small department. Biggest truck was a 45' ladder truck. Kite was twice that height. Dude was pissed when we told him there wasn't anything we could do.\n",

The roles vary from country to country, but in large, paid fire departments, when an emergency call comes into a fire station, there are a couple of people who stay behind and don't go to the emergency. Their role is to manage the station. \n\nWhen a call comes in, they start the fire trucks while everyone else is gearing up. They open the garage bay doors. They close the doors when the trucks are out safely. They may move equipment out of the way, direct traffic if the fire station is located in a busy area, etc. \n\nWhen the crews come back, they'll often be the ones to check all of the equipment on the trucks, make sure anything is replaced that needs to be, and perform light maintenance (fuel being the biggest).",

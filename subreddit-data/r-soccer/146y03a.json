Through his City career he averages a 55% success rate in the league, not the 16.7% we saw this year.\n\nIn the CL this season his rate was 77%. Only Ruben Dias' had a higher success rate on City. The statistic matters, but the only reason why it's misleading is because its a career anomaly.",

This is about tackle success, not tackles attempted. Maldini still had a high tackle success rate even though he made fewer tackles than one would expect. They didn\u2019t measure these statistics back then, but from the hundreds of games I\u2019ve seen him play (because I\u2019m old) he rarely missed, and tbh he still made loads of tackles per game especially when he played LB.\n\nFurthermore, letting an opponent progress with a ball isn\u2019t considered a missed tackle. Missed tackles are generally given when a player either makes an attempt to play either the ball or player and either misses or makes contact without winning back possession. Walker intentionally letting an opponent pass him out wide isn\u2019t going to count against him here. Bumping them and letting them pass might though, I\u2019m not sure. \n\nEither way i still think it\u2019s an interesting statistic even though slightly misleading, that a player considered to be one of the best defensive FBs in the world has lowest 1v1 success rate in the league. It shows that with certain characteristics in the right system, a defender can miss the majority of their tackles and still barely ever concede a goal.",

It's measured by dribblers tackled divided by number of attempts to challenge an opposition dribbler. Walker has 16% this season (4 tackles out of 24 attempts), way below the 55% average during the rest of his City career.\n\nAccording to my understanding, allowing a player to pass him without a challenge so that he can win the ball in recovery does not count as a missed tackle attempt. There needs to be a genuine attempt to play the ball/man and a failure to disrupt possession to count as a failed tackle.",

The statistic is measuring challenge % success, which is literally calculated by dividing the number of \"successful tackles\" by the number of total \"tackles attempted\". Walker has 4 successful tackles in 24 total attempts this season; a 16.7% success rate, which is a massive drop off compared to the 55% he has averaged during his other 5 seasons. You're saying that's because of his positioning and style; but his career numbers don't support that claim. \n\nAnd I'm still not sure why you're comparing him to Maldini or what you think that proves. We're not talking about the number of challenges a player makes, we're talking about their success rate when they attempt one. Maldini's success rate was probably 80-90%. If he committed to a tackle, as calculated, strong, fast, and precise as he was, he almost always won it.",

His team also plays a high line cuz they are comfortable with the knowledge that Walker will always mop up any inefficiencies in their high press tactics.

You need context to fully grasp the value of many of these stats. That would explain why some players will register good stats on specific metrics yet turnout to be mediocre players in general.",

The statistic says that when Walker attempts to win the ball 1v1, he does not succeed more than 4/5 times. His total tackles per 90 in the league this year is .88, which is in the bottom 2% of other fullbacks, supports that he not a strong tackler. That\u2019s an interesting statistic for a player considered to be one of the best RBs in the world. To extrapolate the statistic into \u201cWalker is a bad defender\u201d is wrong, but OP never said that, so I\u2019m surprised at how much debate there is. He said Walker is a poor 1v1 tackler, which is hard to argue this season considering the data.

I didn't read all of his comments. \n\nBut the \"misleading stat based on the way in which he defends\" that this thread keeps parroting is just not true at all. \n\nThe only reason why this stat is misleading is because it's a career anomaly. Walker's City average for the same stat is **55%**, with **66.7%** as his career best in 20/21 (6th highest in the league), not the **16.7%** we saw this season (literally the lowest percentage in the entire league). It's not about his method of defending, i.e. allowing a defender to pass him so that he can win the ball in recovery (which even still, does NOT count as a missed tackle attempt). It's because he was simply poor in the challenge this year with only 4 tackles out of 24 attempts. Way below what Walker usually does.",

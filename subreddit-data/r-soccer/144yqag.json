Given that Tottenham are likely to sell Kane it would make up for the lack of creativity they have in their midfield that losing him will create. Considering this I think they will at least get close to the board's valuation of Madders so if Newcastle want him they will likely need to match whatever Spurs offer.\n\nI think he would be a good player for you, the main issue you had this year was trying to break down teams once they started taking Newcastle seriously and started playing low blocks that Willock and Almiron couldn't break down. Maddison's ability to pass through these defenses is one of his main strengths, you can argue how worth the money he is, but he certainly solves the main issue Newcastle will face from the bottom 10 or so sides in the PL next year.",

Howe's style requires quite a lot of pressing, we really wanted to do that more this season but after there were injuries because of a lack of rotation we couldn't. We had better results when doing that high press but just struggled with the intensity of the game really. If we get a more rounded player in an attacking sense than Maddison I think it would be more suited to where we want to be. When I seen Maddison he really didn't seem to be that type.",

The vast majority will rarely drink during the season, they'll be on a strict diet so high end restaurants will be a rare occurrence and twice a week they they stay in a hotel with the team.   \n\nIt probably doesn't make much difference to a player's life outside football where they live, which is why clubs in the north of England seem to do just fine, despite everyone half the internet thinking that they all want to live in Mayfair.",

The majority of footballers playing for London clubs would live in London. \n\n2. Over time London clubs would become more dominant, as the effect of this magnetic London attraction exerted a flywheel type effect, as slightly better players moved there for less money and in turn led to the clubs achieving more success over time and being able to generate higher revenues.  \n\nNeither of those things are true. Honestly, London clubs have done pretty poorly considering they already have one obvious benefit of a much larger and moderately wealthier (in PPP terms) population.",

There are currently 7 London teams in the top division of English football, and 10 total in the south (counting the midlands as part of the north for this). Half the division. In for example 80/81 there were only 3 London clubs and 7 from the south total. If you\u2019re Brighton you a location advantage over Burnley. \n\nYou also don\u2019t seem to understand that living *near* London means access to London in a way living in the north does not have. You can\u2019t just rule out players living in Surrey. They have the opportunity to live in nice areas and have easy access to a mega city. You do not get the second bit if you live elsewhere. Additionally the weather is much nicer around London than around Manchester. \n\nIt\u2019s objective fact that players do on average prefer London. You are failing to grasp that something being A factor doesn\u2019t make it the ONLY factor. Some players may just prefer other places, some will choose what\u2019s best for their career. And it certainly isn\u2019t bad living basically anywhere if you\u2019re a rich footballer. But it DOES make a difference.",

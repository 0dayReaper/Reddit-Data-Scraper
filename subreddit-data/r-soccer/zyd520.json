            "comment": "RIP to the King of Football!   \n\n\nHere is what some legends had to say about him back in the days:   \n\n\n**Johan Cruyff**: I can be a new Di Stefano, but I can't be a new Pel\u00e9. He is the only one who goes beyond the limits of logic.\r  \n\r  \n**Eric Cantona**: An artist in my eyes is someone who can light up a dark room. I have never found and will never find a difference between Pel\u00e9's pass to Carlos Alberto in the 1970 World Cup final and the poetry of the young Rimbaud. There is in each of these human manifestations an expression of beauty that touches us and gives us a sense of eternity.\r  \n\r  \n**Bobby Moore**: Pel\u00e9 was the most complete player I've ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Fast. Powerful. He could beat people with skill. He could outrun people. He was only 5ft 7in, yet he looked like a giant athlete on the field. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the biggest because he could do anything and everything on a football field. I remember Saldhana, the manager, being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pele. In his opinion, the man could play any position. Sometimes I feel like football was invented for this magical player.\r  \n\r  \n**Michel Platin**i: There's Pel\u00e9, the man, and then Pel\u00e9, the player. And to play like Pel\u00e9 is to play like God.\r  \n\r  \n**Eusebio**: Pel\u00e9 played in an era that had many great players and in that environment he stood out above the rest. He was a complete player in every way, as well as being a kind human being. Cristiano Ronaldo is still young, and has many years ahead of him. But so far, I don't see anyone who compares to Pele.\r  \n\r  \n**Franz Beckenbauer**: Pel\u00e9 is the greatest player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. All others - Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini - are below him. There is no one who compares to Pele.\r  \n\r  \n**Cesar Luis Menotti**: It's ugly to compare, but the greatest was Pel\u00e9. If we believe that God made man, God made Pel\u00e9 perfect. Gave it all to him. Nothing was missing, heading, physical strength, dribbling, finishing, inspiration, genius, temperament, vision, goal. All.\r  \n\r  \n**Gianni Rivera**: However, I think there is someone who was even better (than Messi) and that is Pel\u00e9. He used both feet on the field. He was just as dangerous with his right as he was with his left. He was strong in the air too, and created a lot of chances.\r  \n\r  \n**Hugo Gatti:** Pel\u00e9 had the skin of a player, head, rhythm, everything. It was a panther dressed in white, I played with him. He came in to play at the last minute and managed to turn the game around. And the big difference is that Pel\u00e9 created fear on the field, Maradona didn't... For me it's Pel\u00e9, Alfredo Di Stefano and Maradona, in that order. Thanks to Diego, he's a great player. But Pel\u00e9 was from another planet. \r  \n\r  \n**Tarcisio Burgnich**: I said to myself before the game, 'he's made of skin and bones like everyone else'. But I was wrong.\r  \n\r  \n**Ferenc Puskas**: The greatest player in history was Di Stefano. I refuse to classify Pel\u00e9 as a player. He was above that.\r  \n\r  \n**Sigge Parling**: After the fifth goal, even I had to applaud him.\r  \n\r  \n**Costa Pereira**: I arrived with the hope of stopping a great man, but I left convinced that we just had been destroyed by someone who was not born on the same planet as the rest of us.\r  \n\r  \n**Tost\u00e3o**: Pel\u00e9 was the greatest - just perfect. And off the field he was always smiling and excited. You never see him moody. He loves being Pele.\r  \n\r  \n**Just Fontaine:** When I saw Pel\u00e9 play, I felt like I should hang up my boots, I've never felt so dominated and outclassed like that.\r  \n\r  \n**Andy Warhol**: Pel\u00e9 was one of the few who contradicted my theory: instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.",

A who's who of the world's biggest.\n\nBut when the New York Cosmos sensationally brought Pele out of retirement in 1975, soccer\u2019s popularity exploded, the Cosmos became the most glamorous club on the planet and \u2018The King\u2019 became the VIP of VIPs in NYC.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely everybody wanted to shake his hand, to get a photo with him,\u201d said Mick Jagger of Pele\u2019s presence at Studio 54. \u201cSaying you had partied with Pele was the biggest badge of honour going.\u201d\n\nPele\u2019s presence drew mind-blowing crowds to matches, seduced Muhammad Ali, Peter Frampton, Jagger, Elton John, Diane Keaton, Henry Kissinger, Robert Redford, Rod Stewart and Barbra Streisand into being Cosmos fans, coaxed Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto and Giorgio Chinaglia to the \u2018Big Apple\u2019, and inspired the club to the Soccer Bowl in his swan song.\n\nSource: https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/a-tribute-to-pele-brazil-santos-new-york-cosmos-legend-fifa-world-cup",

                                    "comment": "Then keep in mind he never played a full world cup in his prime.\n\nIn 1958 there were no subs, and he wasn't the starter in the beginning. Legend has it that after the 0-0 draw with England the players themselves decided that whoever was playing ahead of him (I don't remember who it was) would feign injury so that Pele would play. The rest is history, but that history was written in only 4 games, not 6.\n\nBut he was only 17 then though, so not yet in his prime.\n\nHis prime was the early 1960s.\n\nHowever, in 1962 he got injured in the second game. Brazil still won, but he didn't feature.\n\nIn 1966 Brazil went out in the groups, but he was again hacked so much he played quite literally on one leg and was greatly diminished.\n\n1966 is also the year after which all that butchery starts to take its toll (he missed a lot of games then) and his numbers decline a lot compared to the previous years.\n\nSo what you see in 1970 is a very different version of Pele. Still the best in the world, but not the player who would tear through the defense all on his own. \n\nKind of like R9 in 2002 vs. R9 in 1997 or Messi in 2022 vs. Messi in 2012.\n\nSo yeah, three WCs won and the greatest career ever, and people don't even realize that career was never what it could have been with the protection players get today, as in the real world timeline the real prime Pele was gone after he was only 26. Which people don't realize precisely because he was the greatest ever even as it is, so it doesn't get talked about as a \"what if\" the way it is with R9",

It's like if a player like Traore or Lukaku had Messi's technique.

Teams just picked whoever was good with the ball, without a lot of focus on physical traits. E.g Puskas, one of the worlds greatest, was famously short and overweight",

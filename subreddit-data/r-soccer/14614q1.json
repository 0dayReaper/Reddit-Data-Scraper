Then his performances plummeted and he was shipped off to Turkey. A better example is Valencia.",

Even if he played 50 seasons in the super league, he can score 15 goals in 5-6 at most. He can never perform his performance this season again. He scored 7 goals last season and 12 goals the previous season. He has scored 12 penalty goals in the league alone this season. If Icardi had taken the time in Galatasaray in any league, he could have scored 15+ goals. \n\nException players may be Diagne. Borini is already playing like the brain of the team. His team is also an extremely offensive team. That's why they are the 3rd team that conceded the most goals in the league. Diagne can't catch this number of goals anywhere except Turkey. There is also Cenk Tosun. There are also examples to the contrary. Delle Ali is not an single example we have encountered for the first time. Joao Pedro has scored 10+ goals in 3 seasons in Seria A. He scored 18 goals, 16 goals, 12 goals in the last 3 seasons. In Turkey, only 4 goals. His Game quality was extremly poor. So the number of goals scored cannot be an indicator. Just because the quality is low doesn't mean these players will play much better here.",

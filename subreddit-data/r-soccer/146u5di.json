I still feel confident in our chances , I don\u2019t fear Liverpool/Chelsea/Utd/Spurs and I think a treble is as good as it gets for City. They can\u2019t/won\u2019t top this and if there\u2019s any time that they\u2019ll take foot off the pedal or fail to build on greatness or Pep seeking out a new challenge .. then it\u2019ll happen within the next 5 years.   \n\nThis is a good time to be an Arsenal fan personally.",

Not sure what he did exactly, but some offence saw him get pulled from the startting lineup and if I am not mistaken he did not feature at all for quite a few games(Fell behind Dzeko and Kun anyway). Then  Mancini finds himself 2-0 down in a game City needed to win and had no choice but to bring the man on haha",

I mentioned it elsewhere but I'm a season ticket holder at a 7th tier club as well, and you can very visibly notice the increases and decreases in attendance as the club's season varies between looking like its heading for promotion or relegation. Yeah, you had a much more visible core of \"passionate\" regular match-goers, but there were still plenty of non-British fans who I'm sure would be labelled as plastics.\n\nAround the year 2000 a fan survey already claimed that most of our fanbase was non-British. We've had a big (comparatively) following in Denmark &amp; Norway since the 80s when First Division games were first shown there. And look at the explosion of English football abroad now. In a day and age when even League Two clubs boast of their US fan clubs and such, we would definitely have plastics around. Every club has plastics.\n\nMore importantly, though, I think you need to understand what the fanbase was like before the takeover - and by this I am, again, referring largely to the online representation, since that's what's important to reddit, and to a lesser extent to the match-going fan base in general.\n\nI saw a really good article only a few weeks ago (can't remember where it was sadly - maybe The Athletic?) which talked about how the way fan bases are are functions not only of their level but more importantly of the level those clubs believe they should be at. I know people like to peddle the \"City have no history, they are a nothing club\" line but at the point of the takeover we were still the 10th most successful club in English history by trophies won, and 7th in the all-time top division table. We still were the club with the record for the largest English home game attendance of all time.\n\nPoint is, none of the fans were happy with where we were. Even when we were still in the PL, we knew we were underperforming. Sure, we didn't believe we should've been title contenders, but we did feel we should've been good enough to be regular contenders for the lower European spots, instead of constantly flirting with, and frequently failing to avoid, relegation. The club was being chronically mismanaged with no real end in sight and we were beset by money issues. Given all of that, the fanbase was pretty toxic at the time. It only took slight dips in form for the fans to turn on each other and there was basically no faith in the club to ever achieve anything at all. There were constant stories of people going to the ticket office to publicly shred their season tickets over the latest ridiculous turn of events.\n\nPeople act like there's a certain nobility to being a club which \"fails, but fails  the right way\" so to speak, but there was really no nobility there at all, just constant acrimony threatening to boil over.\n\nGiven the choice, I know which I prefer.",

I'm only caught up enough with City history to know that 1999 playoff finale has a special, special place in many City fans' hearts, having chatted to many older Danish fans.",

For me plastic refers to the adults that pick a team only because it is the best without knowing much more or being interested in anything else about the team, as well as those that switch to a different team the moment an old team of theirs starts to underperform. I think one notices genuine fans by how they behave when the team starts underperforming, plastics are quick to switch - Saw that with quite a few friends that switched to United when we started struggling, something I have never thought of doing.",

I've invested so much time and money into following City, from watching matches and debating online and at sports pubs, to visiting Manchester and buying merch, don't think I could ever fall out of love with the club or follow a different foreign club. Money and success was never a factor for me (although had they not have had a relatively strong squad in FIFA 12, I might not have picked them), and I had no idea about the takeover and oil money and what not. I think 10-year-old me was more invested in Minecraft and Pok\u00e9mon at the time than football lol",

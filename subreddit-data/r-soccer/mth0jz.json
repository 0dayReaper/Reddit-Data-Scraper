Maybe with football. The energy, time, passion the fans put  into their teams, it's nothing but a \"market\" to these owners. They are fat vampires leeching on the pride we have for our teams. These American billionaires, these oil merchants, they know they are making a solid investment because of the love us fans have for our clubs. The only way to punish them is to stop caring. It'll be painful. Difficult. Heart-wrenching. But it will be better than supporting these fucks who are trying to literally destroy the greatest game in the world so they can buy another super yacht. Fuck them all.",

There have been definite suspicions since rumblings of this came through in the past year.\n\nThe penny has definitely now dropped for them that, as u/snortingbull said, their audiences reaction to this has gone down about as well as a fart in a lift. They, along with the clubs that compete in the ESL, would see a collapse in support. As such, they've dpne an about turn. They have an almost-monopoly on sports coverage here and in a bunch of other markets, but vitally none of those markets are going to have any interest in a Super League - quite the opposite, a completely justified hatred of the idea.\n\nI've just seen my team get through to their first FA Cup final in half a century, yet I'm sat here absolutely seething. \n\nI'd like to invite fans of these chode-gobblers that there are other clubs in your area. \n\n* For Man Utd and Man City's actual non-plastic fans, you may want to consider Salford or FC United. Further afield, Stockport could definitely use the support. I'd also point you east to the many town clubs just outside Manchester, though for an actual fan it'd take a fair bit of bottle to go cap in hand to an Oldham or a Bolton seeking refuge, lol.\n\n* Liverpool have Tranmere, Marine or Skelmersdale nearby. \n\n* Arsenal and Tottenham fans are in a bit of a desert where they are, but Hendon and Haringey Borough are both close-ish, as is Leyton Orient for a \"bigger\" club to follow. The ridiculous alternative would be to try not to murder each other for five minutes and form a phoenix club between them for the area. Or two, and keep the rivalry alive lower in the league pyramid.\n\n* Chelsea are the ones that would have to swallow their pride and follow a more direct traditional rival - Fulham, Brentford or QPR are the only clubs nearby.\n\nHonestly makes me sick to my stomach. But the game will live on, even if the Premier League eventually eats itself thanks to these greedy suits.",

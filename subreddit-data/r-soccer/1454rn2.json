Not to mention that West Ham have an old squad by PL terms and are going to sell their youngest regular starter and replace him with\u2026 significantly older players. It\u2019s all so slapdash.",

I also want to point out (or how I am rationalizing this) that the pre-season was awful. Loads of injuries to start the season. Aguerd has been wonderful and he wasn't able to set his defense. Scammaca and Paqueta both had injuries early on then we had the World Cup. I am hoping that he can settle this team and work with them to push on. It's what it is. I am too happy.",

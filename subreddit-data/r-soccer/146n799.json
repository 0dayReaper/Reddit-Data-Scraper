He's been for over 3 years and barely done anything. The expectations are literally not that high and he's still doing worse than the baseline\n\nI mean more than his attacking runs, his stamina, hold up play, strength with holding the ball, tracking back consistently etc. This is the level expected, being good at one facet isn't going to work in the prem.....\n\nAlso no one expects him to be amazing lol, if anything just be an above average player that contributes, which he hasn't done...idk what u expect?",

In City's second Premier League winning season, Aguero and Negredo were both injured for the 2nd half of the season, and Dzeko lead City to the title scoring a heap of goals as a starter. Dzeko and Yaya carried City that season.\n\nI don't know why people always have to underrate Dzeko. \n\nEven this clickbait title is wrong. If you read the article Aguero mainly talked about Dzeko.\n\n&gt; \"Today he is still that dangerous player who can score at any time. No wonder he had such a good season at Inter. He always demands, he is very important in the passing game. Surely he will be one of those that City have to be especially careful of.\"",

It doesn't yet make him a master tactician, but he knows when he sees threat and quality beyond popular believes and meme -level scouting. This was at least the case against the Saudis.\n\nIt's a crystal ball question on how Lukaku will perform, but as we know he has actually been in pretty alright form, has a lot to prove before the transfer window and he definitely knows City and the PL way of playing. Sure there is a lot of media buzz about him going either way, but at least Kun acknowledges that City is actually facing a striker that has 5 goals against them, and close to hundred goals on PL. When stars are aligned that sort of player can always be a credible threat.",

And I will always stand by my opinion that in the last 5 years, Neymar was the 3rd best player in the world by a margin. He even had some stretches where you could argue he was the most in form. Imo one of the most wasted talents, his injuries prevented him from going far in the CL with PSG and now he's getting older and brazilians aren't known for going long after their 30s at the top level of performances. I hope he breaks the mold and keeps going like Ronaldo and Messi, he's too good.",

If you visit /r/soccer frequently, you not only know people want this kind of clip but also know this kind of clip (drbbling/skills) is sent and accepted every single day.\n\n\nAll in all, I smell bullshit from this mod team and ask the mod, if he's not a coward, to come explain his bullshit actions.

You\u2019re right that the formation wasn\u2019t great, so I think it best to blame Bowser but also the tactics employed by the newly appointed Shy Guy.",

Sure, he doesn't get the limelight for flashy tricks and skills, but what he does do in terms of controlling tempo and bringing other teammates into the game is essential. Sometimes you need a player with this discipline to take a team to the next level. Eggman is that player, and he's proved it again this season.",

I don't know the cut off, but typically young player is defined as turning 21 the year that the tournament starts.  \n\nPast the age of 20, young player is all relative. Khvicha comes from a minor country and has never played CL. The biggest league he's played in is the Russian league, and he even went back to the Georgian league due to the invasion last year. Haaland and Vinicius have loads of experience at this point. If the age restriction is higher than 21, you simply have to consider a lot more factors than just quality when giving an award like this.",

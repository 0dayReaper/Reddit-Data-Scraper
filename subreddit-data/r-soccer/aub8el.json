That's what someone like SAF would have done (and pretty much did do, with players a lot better than Kepa). No player is bigger than the club, and this is completely unprofessional. If Sarri doesn't punish him like this, then that's it for him, he'd have lost all respect as a leader.",

Absolutely disgusting.\n\nWhether you\u2019re fit or not, if your manager wants you off the pitch... you\u2019re off the pitch. \n\nWhat made is worse is all the Chelsea players seemingly rallying around Kepa and isolating Sarri, rather than having the managers back. I would be absolutely ashamed if I was Azpi and I was captain while a player **refused** manager instruction.\n\nIt actually made me root for City just to see the aftermath. Chelsea are a toxic club through and through ",

I'm not a sarri fan, but I have now completely 180'd. If the club has any real leadership, they will strip that dressing room of its toxic players and give the manager 100% support. Today is the result of YEARS of players disrespecting managers. Chelsea fans should be absolutely disgusted by that display today. Single worst thing I have witnessed in 25 years of watching the game.",

It is not appropriate on the training ground, and sure as shit not in the cup final at fucking Wembley.\n\n2. Azpi, as captain, should have pushed Kepa off the pitch. Sarri is the manager and wanted Kepa off. When it quickly became apparent that Kepa was not going to listen, Azpi should have walked/pushed/dragged Kepa off the fucking pitch. He failed as a captain and team leader.\n\n3. Willy is amazing at penalties anyway, and I would have made the tactical decision to bring him on. I don't know Kepa's record, but fuck it.\n",

The Xperia 10 demonstrating how thin their batteries are.\n\nTo be fair it\u2019s successful, almost every phone uses a Sony camera.

In my opinion he is the best striker of this century after Ronaldo9 and Henry, he just got unlucky with the two GOATS peaking around the same time as him and not getting a proper chance at a real top 3 club (Pep basically disposing him after 6 months).",

It's funny how some of us weren't convinced that we'll get promoted until the game with Arka has ended due to the Krykun trauma. Wis\u0142a fans on the other hand were confident that they're going to demolish the league and yet the only thing that they've dominated is Player of the Month surveys lol\n\nBTW do you remember Moskal mocking Puszcza after we smashed Chrobry?",

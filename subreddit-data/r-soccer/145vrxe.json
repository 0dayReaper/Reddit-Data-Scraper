Also, we've stopped letting kids until they're ~14 but that means they don't get a chance to learn proper technique early when it will do them literally zero damage. \n\nThe deformation of the head isn't the cause of a concussion... It's the jostling of the head. If you hit the ball (rather than letting the ball hit you), that's what should minimize CTE. But to do that, you need to have good technique and be not afraid. And I worry we're squeezing that out of the game.",

The second part is absolutely not true and has no basis in science. Please don\u2019t do spread that info. Either way your brain will be affected, technique or no technique. Only a shock absorbent headband/headgear would nullify some of its affects. But again, none of that matters too much, it\u2019s the pure repetition of hitting the ball over and over. At a young age when your body is still forming the damage could be even worse. Heading is the least important thing in the sport and is easiest skill to master.",

The acceleration variances on your head will be dramatically less if you're the one driving the contact (vs simply receiving the hit). You also are more likely to hit the ball correctly (your forehead vs the dangerous top of the head). \n\nAs for the links, neither are particularly persuasive as one is an anecdotal study on a single individual, the other is largely conjecture and pulls numerous sources with vague connections. The reality is that we don't have great studies that actually isolate heading as the causative impetus for the heightened CTE. We don't have baselines from other contact sports (basketball, etc) to judge. We also know that CTE is present in virtually all competitive athletes (even swimming for reasons I can't fathom) though to a lesser degree than soccer. And NONE of them attempt to differentiate poor heading technique as a potential cause (though we know that poor heading technique DOES lead to higher concussion risk). \n\nRegardless of the causes of CTE, it's that last item (poor technique leads to heightened concussion risk) that I'm more concerned about as a coach. Rules that would limit the most impactful heading (from punta and defending free kicks) seem far more useful than telling a 10 year old girl to duck (and therefore never overcome their fear) when a teammate does a throw in.\n\nI spent most of my youth wearing a pair of sports goggles. The lenses were too big for the frames (I'm REALLY blind) and so when I would head the ball properly, the edge of the ball would sometimes catch the top of the frames and cause the lens to bite into my forehead. I still have a faint scarline from it happening five or six times. Despite my height, I LEARNED to be afraid of the ball. That isn't an easy fear to get over at 15 when suddenly the ball is coming faster and harder than ever. \n\nIf we want to get rid of heading in soccer altogether that's a conversation worth having. If nothing else, it would reduce concussions from poor headers on the top of the head that are frighteningly common. But if heading remains a part of the game, I'm unconvinced with the evidence that the tradeoff we're currently choosing is going to be the optimal health care one.",

A plank of wood on top of a roller skate. One plank is bolted firmly to the roller skate (so it can only be vertical). The other plank is on a pivot (so it can oscillate like a metronome).\n\nNow throw a baseball horizontally at the top of the wooden plank in each one. Both will slide back on the roller skate but the one with the plank on the pivot will slide back a lot less because much of the momentum is transferred to the top of the board, snapping it backwards (essentially transferring the horizontal momentum into angular momentum) while the second will have all of its energy transferred to the entire object (but critically for our purposes resulting in the top of the plank moving much less quickly when measured in isolation).\n\nThat's effectively what happens when you keep your neck muscles rigid on a header. You remove the ability for your neck to pivot and instead guarantee the energy is transferred to your entire body.",

People will-understandably-be sceptical about removing it or limiting it asp art of the game because it's been part of football for so long and it's such a big part of the footballing experience as a whole, but the studies don't lie. Repeated, low-impact head trauma over many years causes significant brain damage and conditions like CTE, dementia, etc. \n\nIt will take someone with severe CTE, maybe someone who loses their mind and commits an act of horrific violence like Chris Benoit or Phillip Adams-before changes are made most likely. It's good that some youth level orgs are limiting heading (particularly in the US) though I imagine most won't follow suit until the senior game changes because it'll lead to a competitive disadvantage and, therefore, less money.\n\nIt is a serious issue though and as more studies come out about the impact of heading on long-term football players there will be more pressure to change.",

When you head the ball, you engage your neck muscles to shove your head into the ball. By doing that, you are keeping your head from jostling at the point of impact. Imagine a baseball bat hitting a ball. The speed of the bat doesn't change much over the course of the swing. Now compare that to me just holding a bat and you throwing a ball at it. When the ball hits, the jerk in the bat (change in acceleration) is going to be MUCH higher than when I swung the bat.\n\nTechnique is important too. If you're doing a proper header, the forehead is making contact with the ball. Poor technique tends to result in impact at the top of the head which GREATLY increases concussion risk (see Andreas Christensen's header when he was with Chelsea for an example).",

It's more that the harder they hit the ball (an object that easily deforms), the more control over their own head they have and therefore the less jarring they motion and less jostling of the brain. Obviously there's some point at which their own acceleration of their head could theoretically concuss themselves but I doubt that's a material part of this equation.",

An easy enough change would be to make it against the rules to head the ball from a kick from the keeper. I also don't know about their efficacy, but if those stupid halo things are effective, those could become required kit. Most head injuries are from head-to-head contact, and those halo things cover the areas most likely to come into contact.",

I am saying, it's not impossible to give Muric his chance be it in the preseason or first games. \n\nSometimes you have to be careful with these things. You replace your number 1 from promotion so unceremoniously like that without even a chance to show he can do it and you can upset the dressing room. \n\nMuric has never really had a shot at the league. Fulham did this exact thing with Bernd Leno. He sat on the bench for two games while Rodak started. It's a respect thing. Now look, if this guy comes in June 11 and blitzes Muric in preseason it's a different story.",

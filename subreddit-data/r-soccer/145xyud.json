    "postText": "Once again, I went through [fbref.com](https://fbref.com) to write down the stats for all goalkeepers who conceded at least 172 goals (I found 243 GKs who reached that hurdle) in the Big 5 European Leagues including how many games they have played to compute the average per game.\n\nThe ones with an average of 1.00 goals or fewer conceded per game:\n\n|Goals conceded per Game|Goalkeeper|\n|:-|:-|\n|0.71|Jan Oblak|\n|0.81|Gianluigi Buffon|\n|0.82|Manuel Neuer, Alisson|\n|0.85|Petr Cech|\n|0.86|V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s|\n|0.89|Oliver Kahn, Thibaut Courtois|\n|0.90|Santiago Ca\u00f1izares, Gr\u00e9gory Coupet|\n|0.91|Lionel Letizi|\n|0.92|Edwin van der Sar|\n|0.93|Mike Maignan, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Ter Stegen|\n|0.95|J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, Christian Abbiati|\n|0.96|Danijel Subasic, Ulrich Ram\u00e9|\n|0.97|Jens Lehmann|\n|0.99|Keylor Navas, C\u00e9dric Carrasso|\n|1.00|Alphonse Areola, Angelo Peruzzi|\n\nIt's insane just how far Jan Oblak is apart from the rest of the pack.\n\nThe ones with an average of 1.62 goals or more conceded per game:\n\n|Goals conceded per Game|Goalkeeper|\n|:-|:-|\n|1.90|Alex Cordaz|\n|1.85|Illan Meslier|\n|1.79|Alexander Schwolow|\n|1.75|Paul Bernardoni, Rub\u00e9n|\n|1.72|Boaz Myhill, Markus Pr\u00f6ll|\n|1.70|Baptiste Reynet, Florian M\u00fcller|\n|1.69|Guillermo Ochoa|\n|1.67|Tim Krul, Alex McCarthy, Brad Guzan|\n|1.67|Tomislav Piplica, Wayne Hennessey|\n|1.65|Richard Golz, Rafal Gikiewicz|\n|1.63|Michael Rensing|\n|1.62|Robert Green, Jiri Pavlenka|\n|1.62|Roberto, Ali Al-Habsi|\n\nrandom info: Alex Cordaz lowered his ratio from 1.92 to 1.90 with the sub appearance last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nActually, I did the research on this a few months ago and only updated the numbers now after the season for the GKs who are still active. I realized now that it would have probably been smarter to take \"games played\" instead of \"goals conceded\" as a qualification hurdle to be included, but it would be too much work to go through all of it again now in all honesty. I coincidentally noticed that Dida for example would rank 2nd with 0.80 but didn't concede enough goals, but he played (a lot) more games than some Goalkeepers who made it into the list because they conceded more goals.",

Keepers generally have longer careers at the top level and anything can happen, but you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who explicitly rates him very highly now.\n\nThe sheer no. of blunders or saveable instances where he directly or indirectly turned into a goal were ridiculous and played a big part in Leeds getting relegated. And those things are majority on the keeper, even if you factor the idea that they're somehow less confident to save shots because they don't trust their own defence, so the defence argument can't be used as much.\n\nThe fact that the limited time with Robles showed an improvement in the saves one should be **expected** to make must've been frustrating. For a keeper as big as he is, just like De Gea Meslier doesn't have good command in his box and often parried simple threats directly into the path of attackers.",

The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a \"no/minor developments\" report.   \n\nIf there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment.

In AZ's most recent games that I watched I'd rank him as the 9th or 10th best player from their starting 11.\n\nThis is just my opinion though. I'm sure AZ supporters who watch every single game for the full 90 minutes can give you a better insight.",

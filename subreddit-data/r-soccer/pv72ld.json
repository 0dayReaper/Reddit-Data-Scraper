Young enough that looking back now in my 30s I shudder at myself.  \n\nThe Time: 2 a.m. \n\nPlace: back room at a dive bar.\n\nSetting: the Finals of a five hour long beer pong tournament. \n\nTo stage left are rows of plastic fold-out tables littered with red solo cups, spilled beer, and the tears of those I'd conquered. Stage right: the bar. And in between I stand with my partner\u2014a 5'11\" Amazonian goddess named Alexandria. Just the single hottest thing I'd ever witnessed on two legs. A woman who, I later found out, \"really valued my friendship.\" But at that beer pong table I was none the wiser.\n\nJust like we'd done all evening, our opponents' cups fell with almost every shot we took. And being 18, maybe younger, you start doing some bad math in your head when you're winning like that with a girl like Alexandria. \"We make such a great team,\" you confide quietly to yourself with every high five she gives you. Your mind wanders to how you might divvy up household chores. \n\nThat magical naivety, I've come to accept, conferred onto me, for one fleeting moment, a shining beacon of glory. I imagine it's how Bird felt when that shot went in. But unlike Bird I've spent my life chasing that dragon, just to get a little taste of how it felt in the moment, and my efforts have been comedically in vain.\n\nWith the last cup standing in doomed vigil at the opposite end of the table, I'm struck by a single ray of brilliant hubris. \n\nTurning to the Amazon I ask, \"Have you ever heard of the 'Wink n' Sink'?\" \n\nI hadn't heard of it either until that very moment.\n\n\"What's that?\" she says. \n\nWithout breaking eye contact I take my shot, and as the ball is arching through the air I give her the slyest, sexiest wink a man could possibly muster. Ball goes in. We win. She leaps into my arms to hug me.\n\nI'm 30 now. Well past my beer pong prime. But when beer pong does show up, I will inevitably ask that same question. And boy oh boy is it not very cool when it doesn't work. And it hasn't. Ever. You might say it's rather sad to be chasing that high so blatantly. But you weren't there, man. You don't know what it felt like to be that cool in front of a woman that fine. That was my nirvana.",

Never seen a worse professional team as far as I remember. Truly shocking. And still Zlatan got almost a goal per game. While LAFC had a decent team all around for example, and still Galaxy would beat them more than they should've. But that's because Ibracadabra. \n\nIf people missed it, they should really watch some of the goals Zlatan scored in the MLS. They are truly crazy, but it feels like many people missed them because it was in the MLS\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/PAzliiJJDFU\n\nBut make sure to watch until the end, the best might be last. And no, it's not the debut goal lol",

Vela's best seasons had Diego Rossi as a complementary attacking threat and a very good pressing team around them; Giovinco had Altidore as a big man to play off of and Bradley as a deep distributor to supply them; Zlatan didn't have anyone worth mentioning until Pavon arrived in late 2019.",

The MLS is seeing a ton of teams build youth facilities in their cities to improve the pipeline and get homegrown talent. Teams that have these tend to be better here. If Messi went to Philadelphia Union, LAFC, Cincinnati, etc then he would dominate because those teams are good. Miami is so far behind.",

In stadium atmosphere is supposedly amazing from the half dozen or more people I know with season tickets. Obviously being historically good to start the season helped it all along, but they already feel like a major beloved local club not even halfway through their inaugural season. Wild stuff.",

I'm beginning to believe that the faster pace will go against Messi who will try to control pace but doesn't have team to actually be effective at this. He's never had to play at the pace that MLS is touted or physically the same game in game out. Especially if Miami make the concacaf championship league where tackles are horrible\n\nWill he score goals? Yes - but probably no more than 20 in a full season in MLS. I think and a reason Messi came to MLS is because it's less pressure but he will find out real quick that there's a shit ton of pressure on him",

If he has problems it will be from the travel. The trip to LA in September will account for pretty close to the entire km traveled in an entire season for Barca or psg. The travel is really sneaky west and tear, so it may slow him down a bit at his age.   \n\nThe ball will get to him often enough. Since the defensive side is under funded games tend to go wide open at times. \n\nMiami is pretty bad, he may be able to bring them up to mid table to complete this season, but that is best case scenario. He can probably carry them through a game or two at a time, but roster rules really promote parity over everything else, and that does a lot to negate what a single player can do.",

Don't know whether these rankings are bullshit are not.\n\nSPI:\n&gt; ESPN's\u00a0Soccer Power Index\u00a0(SPI) is an international and club rating system designed to be the best possible representation of a team's current overall skill level. As opposed to other systems like the FIFA rankings, SPI is forward-looking and predictive.\n\nInter Miami is the lowest ranked team in MLS at 30.3 SPI. Only one team had a worse SPI in the championship.\n\nFuck me, Messi who probably still had a few years left as an elite playmaker is going to the worst team in the MLS. I guess they'll at least make a few signings in anticipation for him. Suarez, Busquets, Jordi Alba, the gang goes to America?",

I wouldnt blame him if my 9 is Mbappe.\n\nWith his current physical condition where he exerts in shorts burst to be able to play all game, he wont be able to do both at the same time. What worries me is that when condition A doesnt happen (eg, Argentina NT of the 2010-2014 era) he walks back to midfield just to get contact with the ball, which forces you to have someone competent as a striker as like I said, he wont be able to do both consistently (obviously still has in it to do it once in a while because the talent is still there).",

Like relegation, salary caps in their own way create excitement league wide, by giving every team a fighting chance to win their title.\n\nA player draft is the way that new talent makes their way into most North American leagues. Instead of teams developing their talent from a young age through youth programs, players instead  play in unaffiliated junior leagues, where they can then be drafted by a pro team once they hit a given leagues minimum age requirements. \n\nDraft selection is typically done through seeding, so the worst team in a league at the end of the season gets the first pick in the draft, followed by the second worst getting the second pick and so on and so forth. Some leagues have what's called a draft lottery which helps eliminate deliberate throwing of games (also called tanking), where the worst team just has the best % chance of receiving that coveted first overall pick.\n\nLike a salary cap, this also helps create parity, by giving the worst teams the best new players and lessening large market teams from just shoving as much cash into their system and out developing the competition. \n\nThe draft lottery and the subsequent draft are usually big in person and televised events, that fans of low standing teams are generally quite excited for each season.\n\nHaving a draft though, isn't compatible with relegation, for I think obvious reasons.",

If they\u2019re asking for more than the players are worth and let teams talk them down a bit. \n\nTake the Mount situation for example. Chelsea are probably asking a bit too much for him, but United are definitely lowballing with their valuation too. It\u2019s all just negotiation tactics. The teams aren\u2019t stupid, they definitely know what they are doing with these ultra high and ultra low valuations/bids.",

I didn't want Havertz when we bought him and can't wait for him to go.\n\nHes definitely talented, but he's a luxury player. There are players like Kante, Enzo, and Silva who will perform well even when the rest of the team is playing like shit, but that's not who Havertz is. Tactically, he's not super flexible and you're only going to get the best out of him when the rest of the team is already performing well.\n\nChelsea need to rebuild and I believe we're at least a few years off really being a good stable team again. Until we hit that point, I think Havertz at Chelsea is bad for both parties. Maybe there's a chance Poch can do with Havertz what he did with Deli Alli, but if we can get a decent offer, why risk it? \n\nLike I said above, I do think he's talented, but I just think it's a bad fit. I'm almost certain if we sold him to Madrid, he'd absolutely shine there.",

He's unlikely to make individuals prolific, but he will make the team as a whole very successful. \n\n\n\nThere is no reason to believe that under Poch, someone who absolutely has made individuals prolific scorers, Havertz wouldn't go back to the level he was before joining us. He was just too good and you don't lose that overnight. \n\n\n\nIf he stays and is used next to Nkunku and we bring in a striker, I really think he'll shine again. He's a quality player who has been put in a shitty situation with us not really having a striker for the whole time he's been here. \n\n\n\nThat being said, if we're planning on using him as a striker again next year and he's told that, I'd fully back him fucking the club over to ensure he gets out. He was too good before he started being jammed in there and I'm sure he'll do it again once used properly (as he's already shown the few times he's played there, usually behind Lukaku last year)",

Tuchel was our last world class manager, and ever since then we\u2019ve only had idiots in charge telling world class talent how to kick the ball. Which obviously leads to them playing like a Sunday league team. \n&gt;Lad hasn\u2019t looked to be worth more than \u00a335m at any point in his Chelsea career. \n\nNot even the CL final when he scored the winning goal? Do people only remember 6 weeks ago or something? What is happening? Do people just love to shit on people?",

As an Arsenal fan, if we were to get them, I'd consider anything above \u00a360m combined an overpay.",

Maybe not a creator himself, but when it comes to picking up on the cheeky ideas of others, he excels. Chelsea were missing a player like Brandt. The understanding those two had at Leverkusen was a joy to watch. Maybe they have such a player in Enzo now, if they can bring in true DM, so he can be moved to 8, and the two get a string of games to foster their relationship. Havertz would still be a much better match for Madrid, though.",

We aren't approaching any club to buy them, that's just our price for them, if clubs don't want to pay, maybe find another players, rather than their fans crying over here. We are not telling other clubs to bail us, are we? ManU is trying to buy Mount on their own, we aren't begging them to give us their mighty 40m for Mount, same for Real and Havertz. Maybe we are just overpricing because these players aren't our priority to sell, but are open if someone overpays? If Brighton ask over the top, they are entitled to ask what they want for their player, but when we do it, it's shameful that we aren't serving our player to interested clubs on platter.\n\nToo bad these clubs can't or won't pay what we want for players they are trying to buy, no one forced them too, they want our players, they will only get them if they pay up, otherwise as everyone thinks, there are better ones out there, they are welcome to buy these other better players. And honestly if these clubs were as smart as their fans here act they are, then they should be in for those batter players in the first place, not in for overpriced flops as the public here proclaim.\n\nAnd maybe just maybe we know not many will pay these fees, and are okay if none does? But hey the experts on reddit think otherwise, so they must be correct.",

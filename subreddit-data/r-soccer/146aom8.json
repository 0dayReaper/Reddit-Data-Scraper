I can't say that City aren't deserved winners but Inter certainly did more than enough IMO and were perhaps even a bit unlucky. Lukaku was just shocking. The difference between him and Dzeko was staggering.\n\nI really liked Inter's tactics very much, especially the usage of the auxiliary CB to mark the free City midfielder in the half space, and alternate their positions to and fro from the back line like a yo-yo. They were also very clearly very well drilled. The best evidence IMO was the first time pass from the right wing from Dzeko to di Marco in acres of space in the left wing.\n\nBut City won't care as they shouldn't. On balance, they really deserved it in the season and perhaps even on the night.",

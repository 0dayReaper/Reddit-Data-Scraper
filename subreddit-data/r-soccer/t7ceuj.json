Then at Inter when he was struggling early on, still never heard him complain and always was giving his all when subbed on.",

S\u00e3o Paulo started to struggle paying him in full after the pandemic started,  and once the board changed (the previous one was awfully generous towards Alves, the new not so much), he started being really petty, constantly exposing the club in interviews, actively looked to leave the club for the fucking olympics before 2 super important knockouts while the club was in relegation zone, shitting on the club in plain olympic podium, and then refusing to return to the club after he won the gold, all while putting out some totally humble quotes like \"I brought S\u00e3o Paulo to the world\" and \"I did more for the club than what they did for me\". Finally, it was rumored after the new board came he started to be not that cool of a guy in the dressing room.\n\nTo put it shortly, dude chose the most shitty way to deal with a financial issue, and also he has an ego the size of West Ham, since the new board didn't treat him like a superstar he started lashing out at every single chance, even aware of the club's situation. You could argue this is just a rant defending my club that didn't pay him but thing is not a single club in Brazil looked to sign him after he was free despite right back being an extinct position in Brazil. Rejection from everywhere  since having someone like that in the dressing room is totally unpredictable. Imagine you owing a lot of money to a player and rivals pick your side instead of his.",

Happy for them and all the fans, it looked like they were playing at the Centenario. On the other hand Italy just embarrassing today. Scared and toothless. We played the worst game of the tournament at the wrong time but big credit to Uruguayans.",

                    "comment": "For Uruguay, I'd say so. Our youth structure works in such a way that we essentially expand the bottleneck to get talent. We made damn sure that the best 11 players we could play, were on the pitch tonight. Through years of filtering, of rummaging. A lot of these kids already have roughly a decade and a half of youth level football experience, so we know who our best are, and they're these guys\n\n\nFor an example, the 2017 U-20 Uruguay team made the semis, and from that team we've gotten Federico Valverde, Rodrigo Bentancur, Diego Laxalt, Santiago Bueno, Santiago Mele, Mathias Olivera, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez, Nicol\u00e1s De La Cruz, Agust\u00edn Rogel, Matias Vi\u00f1a, and Agust\u00edn Canobbio\n\nI realize that to an outsider, these guys might not be well known, but iirc, every single one of these players has been called up to the Uruguayan National Team, and a vast majority of them have debuted and are still regular names. Most of these guys play in the top 5 leagues, and those that don't, still play at a much, much higher level than the Uruguayan League. Most of all, these guys are currently in or entering their primes, and are only getting better. We got 11 players from one youth squad (10 really cuz Laxalt is MIA since like 2019)\n\n\n\nNow, that 2017 squad only got 4th, whereas this squad won the tournament, and arguably without some of our best players. \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez, Real Madrid's striker, wasn't allowed to go, and Luciano Rodriguez, our star player, was suspended during the QF and SF stages. We only had 15 available players vs Israel. \n\nIn my opinion (which is biased, obviously), 7-9 of these guys have the potential to be absolute world beaters, and the rest still seem like they'll be very serviceable squad players or competition for depth at the very least. \n\nFabricio Diaz\nAlan Maturro\nSebasti\u00e1n Boselli\nLuciano Rodriguez\nFranco Gonzalez\nFacundo Gonz\u00e1lez\nRandall Rodriguez\nMateo Ponte \nAndr\u00e9s Ferrari\n\n\nFrom what I've seen, these are the names with the most potential, and that's leaving off \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez, who has already debuted for Real Madrid and scored a late Madrid Derby goal. Aside from these 9, you have the guys who can be serviceable in the future\n\nDe Ritis\nChagas\nDuarte\nDami\u00e1n Garc\u00eda\nNacho Sosa\nJC De Los Santos\nAbaldo\n\n\nNow, obviously, there are a million hurdles to the success of young players. This is the time when the sponsorships, and the money, and the parties, and the drinks, and the drugs, and all of those vices start to appear. Whether these guys will be able to ignore all of that remains to be seen. Also, injuries, bad luck. A million things could go wrong. But, for what it's worth, we managed to get 11 players from a 4th placed squad. This time around, we won the tournament with a squad that was arguably weaker than what we had in qualifiers. There's absolutely no way that we don't at least get 3-4 mainstays in the team for the next decade or so. Knowing our youth system, it just has to be. If not, then we at least have Marcelo Broli, who seems like a coach that we've never really seen before in Uruguay. Uruguayan football is very defensive. You don't usually have managers who prefer attacking football, nor managers who have an exceptional read of the game. Marcelo Broli, however, seems to be a coach that is just unaffected by pressure, and one that can motivate as well as outfox. He did it with Pe\u00f1arol's U-20 team, and he's doing it here. \n\n\nEither way, we're sure to get something really good from this generation, I'm sure\n\n\nSorry for the absolute essay, I'm just very excited about our future prospects",

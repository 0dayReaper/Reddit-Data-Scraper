If he ends up being a top 5-10 striker in the world, which he might already be, you\u2019d think he\u2019s going to want to start games like yesterday. He could be starting for a lot of top clubs right now. If Haaland sticks around and re-ups his contract, I\u2019d imagine Alvarez will eventually push for a move.\n\nI know some City fans will say he gets rotation time and also some time on the wings. If he is a world class 9, then getting some cup matches and time on the wing isn\u2019t going to cut it long term. These guys have egos and want to be best and play in the biggest matches.",

His time in the attacking midfield is a bit overblown as I think it was just one or two matches he did that, and it was a late sub at that. He\u2019s not an attacking midfielder, he\u2019s a guy with an elite nose for goal. As someone else said sure City will love having two world class strikers, but how long will Alvarez be happy being a rotation/cup player when he could be starting for clubs like Bayern or Real Madrid right now.",

They want journalists to write articles about all the money they are going to spend, all the players they are going to sign and how great next season is going to go.

The truth is that I felt during all this time the affection of the people from the Copa to here. That we are living incredible moments with that. (I think he means the affection. Spanish speakers can help.) \n\nAnd I think that this group beyond the fact that we all want to be champions and we want it to happen to us and finish in the best way, we made a flawless process from the Copa America to here. \n\nArriving to this World Cup, receiving a very hard blow in the first match, getting up again and ending up in the final. I think that this group was an example from the beginning to the end and I hope it does not happen to us (losing), but football is football and anything can happen. \n\nThe good thing is that I think that we, the Argentinians, have learned a little about is that it's not only the result, but the whole path traveled before, so we should value that whether we win or lose.\n\nAnd I think that people value a lot more something else, but they have no doubt that we will go out and play as a team.\"",

Go back in time to 2015 and you\u2019d find Argentina flairs all over r/soccer saying this about him. I agree it\u2019s so sad. It just reeked of jealousy/bitterness from Argentinians that Messi\u2019s genius was able to win trophies for Barca but not Argentina. As if it\u2019s his fault Barca gave him Ronaldinho, Xavi, Iniesta, Henry, Villa, Neymar, Suarez and he didn\u2019t have that kind of help with the Albiceleste.\n\nJust look at what he\u2019s able to accomplish with adequate teammates. It\u2019s sad he wasn\u2019t given the help he needed sooner. He clearly loves the NT.",

He achieved his goal and won a tourney with his NT. Of course, coming this close again and not winning will be heartbreaking, but Messi knows he won't go home as a failure or Argentina as failures. He's leading the golden boot and leading assists. He's POTT win or lose against his opponent in the final. Any form of GOAT debate between him and Maradona/Pele will remain open from a \"legends of the game\" perspective. But it's clear he as no modern equal. And I think that resonates with her words. That to the kids of Argentina, he is the best and carries all the inspiration that a Maradona carried for their (grand)parents. He's isn't lesser in anyway. He's fulfilled his duty to his country (and moreso the world), win or lose. He's the best in the modern game, just as Pele was the best in previous generations, as Maradona was in the 80s.\n\nThe underlying message is that the GOAT pedestal will always have a Pele or Maradona mentioned. And win or lose this weekend, Messi is part of that trifecta because of his play and career, BUT also because he's been an inspiration to the sport, multiple generations, etc just as Pele was. He's a Pele. He's a Maradona. He has no modern equal. Win or lose, he's a legend that will always sit at the top and \"our\" modern game will have him crowned as the GOAT, just as previous generations crowned Pele with the same title.",

No doubt he's the trailblazer and the one who paved the way for 'the beautiful game' and propelled football to global status. He'll forever hold that status.\n\nBut personally, seeing how Messi has dominated the world for 15 years as a prolific goalscorer and playmaker in a time where sports science and analytics has transformed football and raised the calibre of players &amp; teams (on average), I can't help but think it's an even more remarkable achievement to me. To score 91 goals in a calendar year. To score the most goals for a single club. To score the most assists in football. Records that are absolutely gargantuan in an era where teams, are on average, better than before. That's what for me makes him the definitive GOAT.\n\nI could see why someone might rate Pele's success and achievements higher in that they came *despite* the modern day advancements in training, fitness, equipment that gives players an edge today. But I don't think he faced the  same calibre of opposition that Messi does today. Yes people are quick to point out that he faced the likes of Beckenbauer &amp; Moore in defense and other forwards like Platini &amp; Puskas but rosy introspection means there's a tendency to embellish how challenging the game was back then (much more chaotic &amp; disorganized) compared to today (without taking away from the fact that Pele was still so good relative to everyone else).\n\nTo me at least, this is why Messi is the GOAT across history, even without a WC to his name (hot take). For everything he's done and is still doing in the most advanced time of the game. That said, you're right that GOAT status continue to have Pele, Maradona and Messi in contention but for the modern era, it's indisputably Messi. No question about his contribution and efforts for Argentina. Hoping they go all the way this WC, for him.",

Arriving here to this World Cup, getting a hard hit the first game, it is beautiful to get back up and end up reaching the final. I believe this group was an exemplar from start to finish and hopefully it all works out but anything can happen in football and the good thing I believe is that us argentinian's have learned this, is that it's not just the result but the whole road travelled to get there..before we valued more just the win or lose and today I feel people value much more, and the last thing is that alright, we have no doubt that we'll keep playing as we have, trying to give our best and to give the most like we've done these last five games.\n\nlink to the full interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o47KPb8DRSc",

WHY the fuck do 90% of sports video posters on reddit have ZERO awareness or ability to appreciate a moment and consistently cut clips as short as possible, often cutting them off right in the middle of incredibly climatic moments or right at the millisecond a score happens, not allowing the moment to breathe at all and allow us to soak up the roar of the crowd and the weight of the moment?? Why do we tolerate this? Fuck all these dudes posting the shittiest highlights possible just so they can be first and get the most imaginary internet points...",

Arriving here to this World Cup, getting a hard hit the first game, it is beautiful to get back up and end up reaching the final. I believe this group was an exemplar from start to finish and hopefully it all works out but anything can happen in football and the good thing I believe is that us argentinian's have learned this, is that it's not just the result but the whole road travelled to get there..before we valued more just the win or lose and today I feel people value much more, and the last thing is that alright, we have no doubt that we'll keep playing as we have, trying to give our best and to give the most like we've done these last five games.",

            "comment": "This is exactly what I say to Messi in my mind before every match he plays even though i am not an Argentinian. Those Messi Ronaldo debates are such a waste of time. I just want to enjoy the pleasure which I get every time he touches the ball on the field. Thank you so much for all these magical moments across the years...\nMuchas muchas gracias!",

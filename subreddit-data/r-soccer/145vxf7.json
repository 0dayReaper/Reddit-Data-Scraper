The best Portuguese midfielder for a decade, 146 caps for Portugal (only second to Ronaldo himself), he formed the backbone of the dreadful 2011-2015 Portugal squad along with Pepe, Ronaldo and Nani. Age caught up to him, of course, but he was pure class and honestly an underrated midfielder of the 2010s.",

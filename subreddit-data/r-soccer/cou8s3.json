I have spent years, decades, studying comedic theory to master the craft of making people laugh. You have insulted me and brought dishonor to my bloodline. My career is now in shambles because of you. You have ruined me. My days of being an internet funny man are no more. I can no longer sustain my family. This calls for a punishment of the highest degree. Since you have shamed me in front of the masses, I shall do the same to you. And all I need to do is utter three simple syllables. R. Slash. Woosh. Good luck recovering from that.",

They can't seem to fathom that some Americans have their own reasons for supporting Bayern Tmobile other than \"glory hunting\", like living in Germany or so on. And it's even worse if you're a newer fan. Crud you for just getting into the sport and choosing a franchise you have some connection to, right?  Only bought that Dortmund jersey so I could burn it in contempt.\n\nReally though, it's better to just expect to not find much intelligent discussion there and a general hostility towards new fans and fans of top franchises, because screw that and MIA SAN MIA.",

Especially that polish people are super cynical and will just shit on other polish teams instead of supporting each other. For me when it\u2019s Europe time, I support all teams no matter who it is because we need to build up our league and the only way to do that is to start regularly having multiple teams in European competitions. That\u2019s like the starting block for improving our league and the NT. Sorry for the rant but it\u2019s just so frustrating.",

They look for boys that grow earlier and to win in lower leagues and then you end up with a bunch of dudes who have zero mentality, no creativity and are not even very fit because they used to be stronger than their peers so they aren't used to the gym at all. So the best Polish footballers are either goalkeepers (but only the old-fashioned shot stoppers because kicking the ball is already a problem), ~~headless horsemen~~ wingers (cuz as long as you can run fast it's good enough) and strikers (shooting instinct is something that doesn't go away). Exceptions are guys that had innate strong work ethic or ones that left Poland early in their development. Literally only creative midfield that Poland has produced in the recent memory is Zieli\u0144ski who seems to be not so strong mentally. And this is the Polish NT, in the Polish league it's a total and utter catastrophe.",

            "comment": "&gt;BBC Sport understands Al-Khelaifi was contacted by the Glazer family a month ago as United's owners tried to get Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani to raise his offer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The conversation with Al-Khelaifi has led to suggestions of a wider Qatari involvement in Sheikh Jassim's bid.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sheikh Jassim has repeatedly said his offer was made in a personal capacity.\n\nLooks like it was the Glazers that contacted NAK to get him to increase Jassim's bid, which Jassim didn't do and who has said he's willing to walk away rather than go beyond the valuation.\n\nSo, either NAK is telling the truth and didn't do as the Glazers asked, or he did raise it with Jassim and Jassim has not done as suggested as he has his own plans.\n\nI think people are tempted to see 'The Qataris' as one big blob, when they aren't. NAK is a close childhood friend and advisor to the current Emir of Qatar (Tamim al-Thani), whereas Jassim is the son of a former Qatari Prime Minister (Hama al-Thani) who was overthrown when Tamim led a palace coup against his father, and got rid of his father's ministers including Hamad.\n\nNow while Jassim is a member of the royal family, and Qatar as a whole certainly benefits from owning a cultural asset like Man United, actual analysts see Jassim's bid as an attempt for that branch of the family to prove they are not has-beens with no pull and that they are still capable of projecting economic power beyond Qatar - as Jassim's father, as PM, he was the one who started Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and began the policy of investing heavily abroad e.g. in London, buying property, the Shard, Harrods etc.\n\nEdit: I'd also add, if analysis about this being an intra-family rivalry is anyway true, then there is a motivation for Jassim to own and run Man United 'better' than PSG, both as a club and in terms of success. But not sure how that tracks with him not wanting to go above a certain amount. What is an extra billion to someone of his family's means? It could be because he actually doesn't have unlimited financing and is not being backed by the state as much as people might assume - but even then, his family is probably one of the richest after the Emir's own. Or it could be a negotiating ploy, the 'anchor strategy', with the Glazers calling NAK might prove that they do want his bid but just want a bit more, and this is Jassim saying he won't go any further. Additionally, Jassim's bid includes further spending above the purchase price, e.g. clearing debts, infrastructure upgrades on training and stadium facilities, 'community spending' and extra transfers; so maybe Jassim is actually at his limit.",

Just to win after failing before?\n\n\nI mean, can\u2019t we say that about literally every single club that wins their first ever CL title? That is just a lame point all around to respect a club for. \n\n\nMaybe I can make sense of resiliency in terms of a team like chapecoense or United after plane disasters wipe out their teams and they need to reassemble?\n\n&gt;It took them over 15 years to lift that trophy, a lot of tough losses taken and lessons learned. Sure they have money but it didn\u2019t happen overnight in the UCL.\n\n\nYou\u2019re right, it didn\u2019t happen over night, it just took a couple more hundreds of millions. \n\n\n\n&gt;Their played development is admirable, so is their medical staff and shrewd business. It\u2019s all first class.\n\n\nYou want us to respect their medical staff, you want that to be a clincher for why we shouldn\u2019t hate Man City the club? \n\n\nTheir shrewd business is subject to an absurd number of financial violations. It\u2019s easy to do shrewd business and sign great players when you can offer them astronomical wages, more than any other clubs of similar stature before you. Shrewd business to respect is a club like Dortmund, who are actually cultivating the 100m players like Haaland, Jude, Lewandowski, Sancho, etc. Why respect Man City for a category like shrewd business that they\u2019re not even a top player in?\n\n\n\n&gt;I get it though, fans want what they\u2019re familiar with. It\u2019s comfortable watching Madrid win every year lol\n\n\nNobody ever said that though, but of course that\u2019s the takeaway for you.\n\n\nWhy not flip it back on you? \u201cI get it, you just want to see state-backed clubs dominate every year, a CL that is a proxy for gulf-Arab cock fights.\u201d",

You mentioned resiliency in terms of winning after trying to win one for so long. I pointed out how ridiculous that is if any club that wins their first ever CL automatically gain that distinction. \n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what happens often or rarely. You made a point, I showed it\u2019s an absurd premise. \n\n\n&gt;Yeah, shrewd business. while Liverpool is blowing their load on Darwin Nunez and Diaz, City is actually doing their homework and making smart signings like Akanji and Alvarez. City is selling guys like Sterling while other clubs cling to their has beens.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s so many things fundamentally misunderstood here. Other clubs, including Liverpool, were in for Akanji. Other clubs were also in for Alvarez. All you are pointing out is how one club could offer more to clinch these signings. Not that City were shrewd in being the only ones to look at these markets. If you want to bring up a case of shrewd business, look at BVB signing Lewandowski while he was an absolutely \u201cnobody\u201d who hadn\u2019t even played in the bundesliga, with no other top clubs comparable to BVB in for him. Ultimately, you suck at bringing up actual shrewd business because City and most top clubs just aren\u2019t that shrewd. People talk like they are, but it all breaks down under closer scrutiny. \n\n\nFinally, City hung on to a Sterling who was already a \u201chas been\u201d for at least 2 seasons too long. Sterling was never the quality to take a pep-level side to the next level. Isn\u2019t it so convenient that only when they finally sell him you can claim \u201clook at that, a club who clearly doesn\u2019t hold on to has beens!!\u201d. Give me a fucking break, you reek of someone woefully uninformed. \n\n\n&gt;doesn\u2019t even have a top five wage bill \n\n\nAt every turn today you\u2019ve shown you simply don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. \n\n\n&gt;Europe has one of the nastiest history\u2019s in the world. A couple \u201c stop racism \u201c banners and rainbow flags isn\u2019t changing the the evil that many European countries have produced.\n\n\nEuropean countries don\u2019t own football clubs you fucking imbecile.

We stuck with him up until his convictions. \n\nTorres was sold for big profit because he was pushing for a move. Spanish player to Barca / Madrid is hard to stop if they come knocking. Same with San\u00e9 and Bayern.\n\nWalker has 250+ apps for City in across 6 seasons. Come off it.\n\nLaporte has found himself on the bench quite a bit this season but he has played a big role in other seasons he's been at the club.\n\nCancelo has attitude problems. It's a good move from City to get rid of such toxicity. Before that he had some great seasons with the club.\n\nThe jury is still out on Phillips who just finished his first season but it seems like Pep will stick with him and give him a chance.\n\n&gt; I've noticed another tactic that Pep has used at all clubs he's been at. Which is: 'Ruin the up and coming team, so that they can't be a threat' As in - Buy Mahrez, so Leicester go to bits.\n\nLol that's a take I haven't heard before. You make it sound like City invented tapping up players. Chelsea bough Kant\u00e9 and Drinkwater immediately after Leicester won the league. We got Mahrez two seasons later when he was already looking for a way out of the club and Leicester had shafted him massively when he had almost joined Roma a season before. Also what about Southampton and Liverpool? They're basically your feeder club at this stage.\n\nYou're grasping at straws here mate but haters gonna hate \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I feel like your argument applies much more to Chelsea or United.\n\n&gt; For example: Nunez at Liverpool HAS to come good, because we can't afford an \u00a380m loss.\n\nI hate this Liverpool \"can't afford\" argument. You're one of the richest clubs in the world. Your owners are worth $21.4 billion. They're just stingy af and somehow that's other club's fault. \n\nCity would also stick with an \u00a380m player for few seasons or try to snag a deal that's somewhat decent if said player became a flop.",

It also doesn\u2019t change how they even got to the position they are in, having been winning most league titles for 5 years already. \n\n\nLook at it over 10 years and things are different. Look at it over since the new ownership came in and it\u2019s even worse.\n\n\nYou mention United being ahead over 10 years like it\u2019s a gotcha, but that is nothing strange or unusual given they probably rival only Real Madrid as the most commercially powerful and profitable club in the world. They got there through decades of sustained success. United are arguably the most well-known football club in the world.",

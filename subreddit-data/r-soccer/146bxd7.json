From reading one of his biographies, it seems a lot of the reason he left Barcelona was due to a lot of political issues that come with being their manager, not necessarily the stress of actually coaching. City has the perfect environment to make his job as stress-free as possible (assuming they don't get hit with some massive punishments due to the financial charges). The whole club is built around him. Everyone in the club seems completely dedicated to meeting his demands. He gets any player he wants, they're always more than happy to get rid of any players who might be causing trouble in the dressing room. Winning the CL was the last big hurdle for him to get over. Could very well see this being his last club job given he's said multiple times he wants to retire from club management relatively early",

People talk about how the team was already good. But it really wasn't. Ronaldinho had gained weight and was showing signs of decline. Same with Deco. Our midfield and defense were a mess. We had no truly world class fullbacks. And Messi was getting injured more often than we would like.  Pep came in and had the balls to get rid of a lot of big players, or at least reduce their roles, in favor of bringing in new, untested players. Think about how insane it is that Pep began to bench Yaya freaking Toure in order to give a then rookie Sergio Busquets time in the first team. Same with Pedro getting more and more time despite being a nobody at the time, at the expense of playing time for players like Eto'o or Henry.  Or the fact that Pep brough back Pique from Man Utd, despite his underwhelming performances there.  Or the signing of Dani Alves? \n\nAll of these names are now famous of course. But back then they were nobodies. Pep is the one who saw their potential and integrated them into the first team.  And that's not even counting how he made Messi into the best player in the world.  He got Messi to begin taking his training seriously, and got him to stop eating so much red meat because it was contributing to his injuries (as am Argentine surely you can understand how big a deal that is). Messi was good before Pep, but after he was the best player in the world.",

Sodas, pizzas, etc. I also suspect it was the type of meats he was eating (milanesas, steaks, etc.). When Guardiola joined he began fighting for Messi to change his habits because they undoubtedly affected his fitness. It took a few years for Messi to really commit to changing his diet, but he finally did, and it has prolonged his career significantly.  You can Google articles about it.  I'm not scientist so I would not be able to tell you the exact reasons certain diets were bad, but generally it was the usual suspects--fatty and sugary foods are not good for you.",

How many managers have been given unlimited funds at Chelsea, PSG, etc and failed to do even half of what he's accomplished? You can say \"well he has the best players...\" all you want, but the man is simply extremely good at coaching football. For all the crazy expensive big names: Ak\u00e9 was a player people were laughing at Chelsea for wanting to spend big money on in the summer, Akanji was seen as some last-minute squad filler player at the start of the season, Cancelo was supposed to be an amazing left back and crucial to City's team and he fucked off mid-season. Yes, he has access to players 99% of manager couldn't hope to, but he still gets more out of every one of his players than just about anyone else could",

So that obviously increases the chances, as you can now enter the CL without winning the league the previous year.\n\nBefore ~96 the teams couldn't have more than 3 foreigners (I'm simplifying, there's exceptions) on your team. So you could only get the best players of your country at best, and then 3 others. Which made it harder to have an extremely dominant side, because you depended on local talent being good and that was limiting. Nowadays you can have like 17 foreigners (plus homegrown ones).\n\nMoney injection/uneven money distribution, has made big teams bigger or newer teams also able to compete.\n\n\nAdd the three factors together, and after a few years you get this. The differences between clubs are more massive than ever. So you end up with super clubs that when they have a good season, are more likely to win it all. They have maybe one or two competitors domestically, and then the CL. So it's bound to happen that the winner of the CL has also won one or two of the domestic tournaments, as they are much better than the rest.",

A lot of the suggestions and ideas for rule changes he made while working for the UEFA initiative were based in the idea to keep the game from being \"watered down\".\n\nVan Basten worked on VAR and suggested a three phase introduction. One phase to let referees and technicians get used to the technology, one phase to implement all the red cards/penalties/offside issues and one phase to introduce yellows for time wasting (VAR reviews for dives) and unsportsmanlike behaviour (crowding the ref).",

So you know how this will eventually end.\n\n[But European channels have laws on how many ads can be shown in an hour.](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52004XC0428\\(01\\)&amp;from=DE)\n\n&gt; In the light of the original wording of the television without frontiers Directive, the Member States differed in their interpretation of the provision of Article 18 that \"the amount of spot advertising within a given one-hour period shall not exceed 20%\". According to the sliding hour criterion adopted by some Member States, a broadcaster could not broadcast more than 20 % advertising, regardless of the precise moment from which a given one-hour period was deemed to run. This interpretation amounted to an **absolute ban on the broadcast of advertising for a continuous period of more than 12 minutes**. However, according to the clock hour criterion adopted by other Member States, a reference hour constituted a period of 60 consecutive minutes, starting at minute 0 and ending at minute 59 (natural clock hour) or starting at any time after minute 0, for example where a broadcaster's broadcasts start at 6.05 on any given day (overlapping clock hour). In this latter case, consecutive clock hours would run from 6.05 to 7.04, from 7.05 to 8.04, and so on.\n\n--\n\n&gt; Article 11(4) provides that where programmes, other than those covered by paragraph 2, are interrupted by advertising or teleshopping spots, **a period of at least 20 minutes should elapse between each successive advertising break within the programme.**\n\n---\n\n&gt; Sports programmes. The Commission would like to clarify how the provisions of Article 11 apply to sports programmes. In this respect, it should be recalled that Article 11(2) applies only to \"sports programmes ... containing intervals\". The interval must be natural and recurring and directly linked to the structure of the performance or event, as suggested by the explicit reference to \"similarly structured events and performances\". The explanatory report specifies that the notion of \"autonomous part\" during sports programmes must, generally speaking, correspond to natural breaks which are in keeping with the sport in question(28). This does not cover single accidental breaks, since all conceivable programmes would otherwise be covered by Article 11(2) of the Directive and not only those specifically mentioned. **For instance, concerning football, it follows from this interpretation that a corner, a free kick, a player replacement, etc., which does not entail a break in the game, does not constitute an interruption within the meaning of Article 11(2).**\n\nNow the European leagues could timeout the game until US or other countries broadcasters have taken ads, but there would be a hell of a lot of useless waiting around for Europe and people would tune out.",

But you're gonna have to play every single second that you wasted as added time.\n\nYou want stopped clocked, just that doesn't look like it's stopped.\n\nAnd it's not realistic, because the _actual_ play time today is around 30 minutes per half. Doing what you are saying is increasing actual game time by 50%. That's why it's not doable.\n\nYou want to do 30 running minutes then, and the clock never stops, but you have _another_ clock that counts the time the ball wasn't in play... and then you add _that_ time to the time. And then for the extra 5 minutes you also have that clock counting... and then you add the time lost during that time... and then again and again in smaller and smaller increments?\n\nIt's literally clock stopping with extra steps.\n\n&gt; And more yellow cards of course for intentional time wasting even if it's the 5th minute.\n\nThe cards should still be given because you still interrupt the flow, even if the game time is still accounted for.",

Also, broadcasters will shove adverts in their regions regardless, they're not going to wait for stopclocks for that opportunity.\n\nExamples: The Super League (top division of rugby league in UK) was set up in the 90s with Sky, in a very similar story to the Premier League's breakaway. It has adopted far more intrusive commercialisation than football, such as changing club names (most teams adopted a mascot-style name like Wigan Warriors or Leeds Rhinos), and multiple shirt and shorts sponsors. Even the [video ref decisions on the big screen are sponsored (this example is from the Australian NRL, but it's a very similar style of sponsoring the TRY and NO TRY decisions)](https://youtu.be/RAxHmRdutkc?t=55). It uses a stopclock when the ball is out of play. It would have been ripe for that additional advertising when the clock is stopped, and **it does not have additional advertising here**. The clock is stopped, but the break is no longer than natural, ie. The ball goes out, the clock stops whilst the player runs to get the ball to restart play, the clock restarts. From the style of commercialisation already happening in Super League, you'd be forgiven for thinking it would be ripe for yet another advert break here, but it doesn't happen because it would clearly intrude on and interrupt the actual gameplay, which isn't the design of the stopclock.\n\nIn contrast, if I watch an American or South African broadcast of a Premier League match, I will already see additional adverts when they make the screen 30% smaller to force an advert around the sides during live play. \n\nBroadcasters will force adverts into live play if they want to, they don't need stopclocks for that. But when adverts have a genuine impact on live play, (responsible) broadcasters will not have it interrupt the actual sport.",

That means it's still not flowing, the clock is just paused when players are acting out whatever they need to break up the game. \n\nCompletely agree on the communication with refs. Only the captain should approach, if the rest do, hand put yellows, if someone already has one give them a 2nd.

Refs would have all the rights in the world to just stand up for themselves and hand out 2nd yellows for aggressive arguing, shouting etc. Yet they are put in this mad situation by the players, their respective associations and football in general that if they red card somebody for being an absolute aggressor they are tipping the scales of the game, but if they hand out a second yellow or a red for a rule breach they barely saw or what is highly subjective (like a tackle or a hand ball situation), they are instantly backed by their higher ups.\n\nOf course I know what people mean under refs tipping the scales and it absolutely happens, but everybody (the ref himself especially) should understand that when a player gets sent off for spitting in the mouth of the ref then its them whould tip the scales and not the ref.",

Give the other team a choice of where to kick from outside of the box.\n\n2 - Embellishments, if a referee determines that you're exaggerating they can give you a penalty as well. This includes if a player actually committed a foul on you. In that situation the ref will give both players penalties. Dunno how offsetting penalties would be handled in football though.",

If lets say Thomas M\u00fcller can get away with bullying the ref in front of a multi million audience, why shouldn't the amateur player be able to do the same when only a handful of people are watching?\n\nKids being the same, why not fakeing a injury like Neymar or shithouse like Atletico when they are successful with this?\n\nOf course we need a change at grassroot levels but in my eyes these changes are bound to changes in the professional levels as well.",

It's the same thing. When there's a fight, or long injuries, or lights go out, or a dog comes into the field, or anything else that interrupts the game, the time is added later... So if are actually compensating from the wasted time one way or another, you would end up with a similar amount of play time.\n\nSo why not doing it the most efficient and transparent way?\n\nIt might actually be better since with injury time players will still act it up. With stop clock the do the same.\n\nYou still schedule the same window time for games as you do now. The idea is to keep the same average actual play time, but across the board.",

That's 8 timeouts for a total of 25 _forced_ tv breaks, then you have the normal timeouts, plus half time and the other two intervals... In total it's around 60 minutes of not playing, without even touching the ball.\n\nThere's a lot of dead time in NBA.\n\nDo this math, you have 48 minutes of actual play in the NBA. In soccer it's between 50 and 60 of actual play for ~95 minutes of \"clock time\", depending the game. And the overall time is around 2 hours including the half time.\n\nIf we were to use NBA numbers, for the 48 minutes of real play it would be like a soccer game lasting 75-90 minutes on the always running clock. If you add the hour of non play time I talked about before... then you get... from 2 to 3 hours of duration...\n\nAs you can see, the difference is the forced tv timeouts, the normal timeouts, and the two extra breaks in the quarters.

Offside wasn't even a part of the rules at first. Then it changed multiple times.\n\nThen we added VAR to review it and get way better and fairer outcomes.\n\nWhat's the \"pure\" football? Which version of offside should we go back? Shall we remove VAR go back to having unfair offside goals?\n\nAnd that's not the only change. The freaking starting kick was changed.

The Commission would like to clarify how the provisions of Article 11 apply to sports programmes. In this respect, it should be recalled that Article 11(2) applies only to \"sports programmes ... containing intervals\". The interval must be natural and recurring and directly linked to the structure of the performance or event, as suggested by the explicit reference to \"similarly structured events and performances\". The explanatory report specifies that the notion of \"autonomous part\" during sports programmes must, generally speaking, correspond to natural breaks which are in keeping with the sport in question(28). This does not cover single accidental breaks, since all conceivable programmes would otherwise be covered by Article 11(2) of the Directive and not only those specifically mentioned. **For instance, concerning football, it follows from this interpretation that a corner, a free kick, a player replacement, etc., which does not entail a break in the game, does not constitute an interruption within the meaning of Article 11(2).**",

The sport would be come unwatchable to me. \n\n\nOne of the best things about football is that I can pretty much pinpoint when a game ends. This is extremely helpful not only when I schedule to watch a match on tv, but especially when I attend one at the stadium. It's also much more entertaining to watch as interruptions feel like a natural part of the game flow and not like actual interruptions for which the clock has to be stopped every single instance, making an interruption feel much more boring to sit through. I can also the risk of such interruptions being used as an opportunity to show ads mid-game since it would be more practical for broadcasters to plan and schedule when to show how many ads, adding to the boredom aspect. \n\n\nSo overall it's a strong no from me on effective playing time.",

It is infuriating to support a club that is banged by FFP every single year when wealthy Arab states can buy clubs and instantly bypass the same laws without a single point being withdrawn.  \n\n\nAs I see it the shithousery is something the less rich clubs use to compete with the infinitely wealthy clubs to drag them down to their level.  \n\n\nThe harassment of the officials is however something that absolutely has to stop, even though the refs can seem like corrupt buckets of farts it absolutely melts my brain when I have to watch massage therapists and goalkeeping coaches getting red carded because it's the norm to harass the ref every time a throw in happens.",

I think it\u2019s silly to expect a team like Elche to go toe to toe in open flowing football against a team like Real Madrid. Might not be best example because I don\u2019t know how Elche play but point is teams with smaller resources and less quality in their team can consciously chose to time waste in order to get a point, or three if they go up. It\u2019s not very entertaining but all that matters is taking as much as you can in points",

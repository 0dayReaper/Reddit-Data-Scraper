You can't plan on Tchouameni when Real wants him and he wants them. Last summer they went for Skriniar and Inter said no. So we were short on CBs all season. We end up signing rotational/bench players, but not the quality needed.\n\nAnyway, I'm not down on Campos yet. We seem to have a good budget this summer, because we got rid of Messi's and Ramos' wages. If we manage to finally sell some dead weight coming back from loan, this could go well. \n\nYou just got to forgive a PSG fan for not trusting that the clown show is finally over ;)",

A decently sized portion of the fans want him to stay and honestly he should. He just got surgery for his metatarsal injury (the one that keeps coming back) so he should hopefully be injured less and when on the pitch he gives it his all which is why he\u2019s rarely been booed (sad that is still happens when he clearly wants to win and does everything in his power to do so but hey)z",

He crashed out of the UCL against Villareal in the first season, and Bayern\u2019s league campaign was already quite problematic under him. \n\nDoes he have potential as a manger? Obviously.

Anyways, out of this list, going for Jose is the best option.\n\nWhat PSG needs right now is someone coming in and injecting them with a winning mentality. Someone that changes the culture and will be undisputed by the players. In the 2000s, Real Madrid was a pushover in the UCL - Jose came and changed the culture. \n\nNagelsmann is the new shiny toy on the managerial market, but when looking at his profile (young manager that plays offensive football), he isn\u2019t that much different compared to Tuchel and Pochettino when they were brought in - only that the other two had better credentials. Yet they still failed at PSG. \n\nIn the modern day managers very rarely stay at the same club for longer than 2-3 seasons anyways, so Mourinho eventually falling out with the club seems like a non-issue.",

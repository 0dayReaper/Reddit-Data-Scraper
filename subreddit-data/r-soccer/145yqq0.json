We turned that down for Russo - which tbf was nice to see because this season was our best chance at a major trophy for a while.\n\nJust for a bit of context, she averages a goal every other game pretty much between us and England. That\u2019s a great record given we\u2019re not really one of the powerhouses of women\u2019s football.",

But if your board was semicompetent you could get England for example, who scored more in half a season with spurs than russo the whole season, and she wouldn't be missed",

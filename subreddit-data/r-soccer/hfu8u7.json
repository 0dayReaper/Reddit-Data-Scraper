It's unbelievable how much he's done in what 4.5 years? Build that man a statue. \n\nA lot of people deserve credit but Klopp was and is the glue that holds it all together.

But also because I know my friend (hi, Colin, if you're reading this!) will be happy.\n\nThere's no doubt that this Liverpool team is exceptional. And not only have they played winning football, they've played attractive football as well. And even when it's not quite worked for them, they've been able to find what's needed to win without playing ugly football.\n\nNot only that, but the club has shown class off-pitch too. Jurgen Klopp gets more likeable every time I see him interviewed.\n\nIt's been a pleasure to watch you, except when you've played us, and I look forward to challenging you for the title (I can dream, right?) next year.\n\nParty hard, you've deserved it.

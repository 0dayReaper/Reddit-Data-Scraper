I checked Haaland, and his average for the group stage is 7.73 and for knockouts 7.46.\n\nEdit. Checked Vini out of curiosity and his numbers are pretty 50/50. 7.75 for the group stage and 7.77 for the knockouts.",

Valverde has been the engine of the team and when he had to play alongside Kroos and Modric all the time he simply burned out. He had too much work to do on their behalf. Then you see some fans slandering him for literally allowing Kroos on Modric to walk around the pitch. Valverde is our most important midfielder for past two seasons. He just doesnt have the luxury of playing besides Valverde.",

The problem these days is that you cannot really shut down the opposition the way Mou and Simeone used to do it - Since in the VAR era lots of contact in your half ultimately means a penalty or free-kick sooner or later. Atleast back then you could get away with a few dark arts here and there that would not be noticed by the ref. It has also made defending much more ehausting - Alltoooften feels like defenders tire(Both mentally and physically) quicker than the oppposing attackers when playing against a team like City because of how easy keeping the ball comes to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If Inter had gone in all defensive the would have lost by even more.",

Then you see some fans slandering him for literally allowing Kroos on Modric to walk around the pitch. Valverde is our most important midfielder for past two seasons. He just doesnt have the luxury of playing besides Valverde.",

However, I assume someone said the quote that you are replying to in his defence to justify the claim that he is 'world class' when in reality he was never considered that highly, and the majority of the 'saves' he made in that record breaking game were shot right at him. He still did make some incredible saves that day, and this is all from memory as like I said, this was 4 years ago, so I could be wrong with some of this. It is the internet after all, I could be talking complete shit for all you know. ",

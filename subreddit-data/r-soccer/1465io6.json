It was 2010, and he had just returned to play for Flamengo after being too depressed to play in Europe. He then appeared in the newspapers posing with a golden AK-47 along with his old buddies from the local gang.\n\nedit: it was a Saturday night (technically early Sunday morning) party, and Flamengo had a match kicking off just 12 hours later. He didn't play.",

He recovered at S\u00e3o Paulo, went back to Inter and scored some important goals but he was a shadow of himself already and again got really depressive and alcoholic. Then he stopped playing as he fell out of love for playing and went back to his family at the Favela. Finally, even if not 100% fit at the end of his career (like at 27 years old lol) in 2009 at Flamengo he had a great season being the top scorer, winning the title and scoring bangers. After that it really was just attempts that failed like his Roma season.",

Debatable with 2010 probably.\n\n- 2006 it had one of the best squads ever but managing issues.\n\n- 2010 was rough, Dunga was a strong leader, a mediocre manager, and terribly stubborn calling weird names when we had like Neymar, Ganso and Ronaldinho flying waiting to be called. We could have a better squad.\n\n- 2014 it was weird. It had great names like Marcelo, Daniel Alves, Thiago Silva, David Luiz was on a good time of his career, Fernandinho, Neymar, Hulk\u2026 but also lots of weaker names that didn\u2019t bring much to the table and succumbed at the big game. Didn\u2019t help we lost Neymar and Thiago Silva for that game, the two best players. The pressure was too high also, and a complete shutdown of emotions when things went south. The country was heavy in political warfare, needing a win, and it was a tough toll on them.\n\n- 2018 it seemed like the return of a good quality squad, modernized, where most players were key players on european teams. Great football all around, the match against Belgium could go either way and we had our chances but Courtois was amazing, and the whole golden age of Belgium squad too. Bad luck.\n\n- 2022, again a very good squad, even better than 2018, more mature with lots of quality players. Neymar, Vini, Rodrygo, Martinelli, Richarlison on a good moment, a very balanced team. But again an european team had the superior mentality. Brazil made a very fatal mistake not holding the ball properly, not making a fault to stop the counter attack, and the mental aspect was key for penalties. A shame tbh it would be amazing to see Brazil x Argentina in the semifinal.",

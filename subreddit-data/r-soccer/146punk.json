Also Videoton could have really used him in this season instead of just retiring his number and dropping him.",

He still has his moments like forcing an own goal vs Iceland in 2016 Euros, coming in for injured Szalai last Euros vs France; but like we really struggled for goals for a while and he would just not get play time over the Marton Eppels of the world for some reason.",

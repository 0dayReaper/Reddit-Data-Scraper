Not just because he did badly, but because \n\na) everyone at the club hated him. He made no effort to connect with the fans. He picked fights with the whole squad including his captain. The football he played was awful and turgid and the results were very bad\n\nb) it doesn\u2019t help that the next manager came in and instantly got that team winning - it shows it wasn\u2019t a bad squad he had \n\nHe\u2019s not written off, but I think he\u2019s going to need to take a job outside the PL first to restablish himself before a prem team comes knocking \n\nIt\u2019s not gonna help that because of how he got on at Villa basically no teams\u2019 fans want him, so any board thinking of hiring him has to factor in fan backlash",

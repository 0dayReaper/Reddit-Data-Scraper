Both parties deeply regret that in the end it will not be possible to fulfil the wishes of both the player and the Club.**\n\n**Bar\u00e7a would like to thank the player for his contribution to the growth of the institution and wishes him all the best in his personal and professional life\".**   \n  \n----  \n  \n(for those that like us can't see the page, as it, well, colapsed.)",

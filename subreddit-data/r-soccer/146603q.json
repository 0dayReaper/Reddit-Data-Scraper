With Mac we now currently have 15 internationals, Henderson as association trained, and Trent, Curtis, Kelleher, Gomez, Phillips and a bunch youngsters who could qualify as club trained. Now the fan sentiment in general is that we should be looking at signing at least 2 more midfielders and a CB, and seeing as we are probably priced out of Mount, Bellingham and Rice transfers, I must admit I\u2019m not quite sure how we can do it without a departure. The simplest way would have been to keep Kelleher or sign a HG keeper for 2nd choice as I\u2019m sure we have at least one youth keeper ready to be 3rd choice, but now I would assume the plan is to look for suitors to Matip or Thiago, or postpone parts of the rebuild until next summer. I\u2019m not certain what the best move is in this situation, but I\u2019m sure the club will pull something off.",

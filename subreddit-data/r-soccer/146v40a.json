Did you see what the standards at the club looked like before he got there? You think all those young British players would have reacted to a kick up the arse from Mick Beale the same way they would for Steven Gerrard? I don't. \n\nI fully admit Stevie is more of a captain in a suit on the sideline, but this rush to totally discredit his time at Rangers is going too far imo. Wouldn't have won the league and made it to back to back European knockout stages without him re-setting the tone around the club, any Rangers fan telling you different is just scared his getting found out as an actual manager makes us look bad.",

Maybe the context that Rangers, up until then, and since then, hadn't won the title?

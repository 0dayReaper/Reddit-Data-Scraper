I'm sure you guys will pick out great quotes but the one that sticks with me that I've never heard: \"The eyes are useless when the mind is blind.\" Powerful stuff, love Henry \u2764\ufe0f",

Meaning you might as well not have seen it in the first place. So you might aswell be blind.\n\nFor example I blindly believe that the world is flat and choose to ignore everything I've seen to disprove that belief.",

Playing under empty stadiums, 2. Forfeiting games, 3. Point deductions, 4. Relegation, 5. Expulsion from league. \n\nIf they hurt the fan base where it hurts the most, the fan base organically will revel against this type of behavior as unacceptable, and unequivocally. But the effort to go these lengths have not been put in place because FIFA has not enacted the most forceful, overwhelming and devastating consequences to a club\u2019s ultimate livelihood and bottom line. \n\nThe moment the mere bloodline of a club is threatened, everybody- from the grounds crew to the board of directors- will galvanize against this issue. Until then, nothing will change.",

Teams get point deductions and players get booted from the game at any level for the rest of the their lives. \n\nTheres a line in breaking bad that is so on point for so much of life today \"No half measures\". Scorch the fucking earth with these cunts. No more pointless slogans that do nothing. No more talking to black players and ex players like they are the only ones who have any kind of idea how to tackle bigotry. We all know how to tackle it, with extreme prejudice. It's not rocket science. If you keep giving slaps on the wrist or \"education seminars\" you wont make any dent in this shit in the sport. \n\n1. All clubs are responsible for the actions of their respective supporters in and around stadiums and designated fans areas. Any instance of bigotry will be met with unlimited fines that start at the base income made by the club for the previous year, point deductions and in some cases expulsion from all leagues. \n2. Any supporter of any club found to be guilty or bigotry of any kind well be fined a minimum of 1 million GBP or equivalent. Or unlimited jail time. You want to be a racist piece of shit? Do it at your own house. \n3. Any player racially abusing another player or supporter or club staff member will be banned for life at all levels of football and be fined an amount not less than their entire monetary gain they have made directly or indirectly through football since the age of 16. \n\nNo more half measures. You wanna be a footballer? This is in your contract. You wanna own a club? This is in your contract. You wanna ticket to a game? This is part of the shit you sign to get that ticket. You must agree to all of this to take part in football at any level. Fuck racist, fuck sexists, and fuck the anti LGBT dipshits. You can all stay home jerk off at old Hitler videos for all I care. Just get the fuck out of our game.",

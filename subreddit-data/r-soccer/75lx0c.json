Lusson sees this every week as he moves between the teenage girls team he coaches in the wealthy San Francisco enclave of Pacific Heights, and the teams he manages in lower-income Hayward. One night, a few weeks ago, he listened as girls on the Pacific Heights team talked excitedly about applications to elite east coast colleges. The next day, in Hayward, nobody talked about college.\n\n&gt;And yet he is amazed by the skill of his Hayward players, who he says would crush the Pacific Heights team in a match. These are the players who could be the future of American soccer, perhaps even rising as high as a national team. But he also knows that the Pacific Heights players will be the ones to play on their college teams and will be identified by US Soccer. They are the ones who will get a chance that the Hayward kids won\u2019t. And this strikes Lusson as very wrong.\n\n&gt;The other day, he went to watch a match between a team made up of mostly upper-income San Francisco-area college players against a group of players from poorer neighborhoods in the East Bay and Fresno three hours away. For a few minutes, the college players controlled the game until their untrained opponents deciphered their system, and then ripped it apart by half-time. In the second half, the East Bay-Fresno team trampled the San Francisco team",

I have played Sunday pick-up for the past decade with portions of my time being spent on the bench due to two ACL tears. While not very good for my agility, it has enabled me to coach my drunkard friends to back-to-back 0-11 seasons. I know I may not look promising, but my god did we have heart. We started out games sober, but when we finished a game, I was barely intelligible and our goalie was curled up in the side of the net. I inspired him so that his head would stick over the goal line, somehow stopping nine out of ten shots on average. ",

That said, this team should have got a result tonight anyway. It appeared to lack effort in many areas of play. The players lost, but the coach did them no favors. ",

You couldn't beat a team with a population of one of our small cities, and will still come up with some B.S reason for keeping this incompetent staff around. Twellman said it best \"If you can't beat Trinidad, you don't deserve to go to the World Cup\" Not a single player gave a care in the world, and Bradley, Gonzales, and several other should be nowhere near this team. This was a needed wake up call, and shows us how far away we still are from being able to actually become a consistent World Cup contender. This is also even more proof that Klinsman was not the problem. After the embarrassing start to qualifying, the one person that was decided the be \"the weak link\" was the only person who had actual pedigree. If that was Arena at the time, there is no way he would've gotten sacked because the federation still looks at him like he is the savior of U.S soccer. I'm almost glad that we won't be going, simply because we are saved of further embarrassment\n\nTLDR: everything associated with USMNT is awful\n\nEdit: Additionallty, if our players actually want to improve, then why don't you go work your butt off in Europe instead of collecting your paycheck in the MLS. The MLS makes mediocre players feel like stars (Altidore, Zardes, ETC) Then again, with the way we played tonight, most of the side couldn't even break into the first team at Wycombe.",

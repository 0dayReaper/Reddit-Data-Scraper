He coached bafana to their first trophy and then guided us to the world cup.\n\n Unfortunately the thugs running the soccer federation removed him just before the world cup to put one and unknown inexperienced person in charge who would cause the biggest humiliation we've seen at that point. \n\nIf Clive was coach at the 98 world cup we would have definitely progressed past the first round",

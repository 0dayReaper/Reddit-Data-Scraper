His goal is to finish somewhere between 7-10th seed so that he doesn\u2019t have to watch a terrible team, but also doesn\u2019t have to actually make changes to the organization that would be uncomfortable to his Yes men. Who fucking knows why he feels the need to show loyalty to the people around him responsible for keeping the wizards mired in mediocrity for literal decades, but he has. He did the same crap with Arenas (which was a great deal until arenas decided that the locker room was actually the streets, and pulled out his handgun in front of now-convicted murderer javaris crittendon), Porter, and now Beal. He also gave enormous contracts to Ian Mahimni, who contributed less to the team than I did, and Andrew Nicholson who was a 12th man. \n\nThe bottom line is that he simply refused to hire from outside of the organization. Finally, something broke this off-season. He fired the GM and brought in 3 new faces from the thunder and clippers, and is emphasizing a willingness to rebuild and acknowledge that a lot of losing is gonna happen before a championship team appears. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.",

Plus you'll sell masses of merch because he's easily the biggest draw in the sport.\n\nThere are stars, there are superstars, and then there are superstars that the superstars should thank for making the entire league richer. Karl Malone just sold a bunch of memorabilia and the highest fetching item by far was a Jordan piece. That's Ohtani and Messi's level.",

It really puts into perspective the difference between recreational and professional soccer. There are a group of guys that play (11v11 with referee and all) in the field in the middle of the track I walk and it's crazy how TFC players, even being some of the shittiest in the league right now would run circles around any of these guys. \n\nBy \"objectively\" I just mean that unlike the 3rd stringers in top European clubs, I don't think these guys would have much of a career anyway if they left this league (maybe they could play in Central America, but the salaries would be *waaay* worse).

And this is for a sport that nobody outside of the US watches. There's a lot of unlikely levers MLS can pull now that Messi has joined. Firstly his pals might join too, Suarez etc. Secondly, maybe MLS will be able to pull a few Mexican teams or have more interactions with Liga MX. Thirdly if they play their cards right their TV contract exceeding the French league's contract is inevitable and MLS will be able to be seen as a 'top league' as well, in the same breath as the Portuguese, Dutch and French leagues. Finally if it really grows that much in prominence you'll start seeing much much more investment, but this all hinges on MLS reaching MLB/NHL/NBA levels of popularity in the US, which I think is possible. The key is through shows like Drive to Survive and Wrexham",

Far from it, just one of the most error prone.\n\nHis last season was probably his most stable and it looks like he's been continuing that form ever since",

People are going crazy everywhere saying things like '**football is dead**\", \"**oil money club**\" \"**115 charges boooo**\"and everything but I would like to believe that it was destined to be (For all the troll they have been getting these years.).\n\n\"Money doesn't mean everything in modern football\", well it's an integral part for success but you can't win everything with only money, look at the shambaholic state Chelsea are in this season. You need \n\nGonna end by congratulating Pep Guardiola, my favourite manager for winning the treble, \n\n(Ultimately I am just saying city has won the treble and you can't change anything about it.

Before that it was pretty rare for players to have long and successful careers in both continents so it gets pretty unlikely. Also for European players since very few of them came to play in South America to win a Libertadores and corresponding national titles (specially considering they must have also won the WC which narrows the possibilities a lot). The only two that came to mind were Trezeguet ('98 champion) and De Rossi ('06 champion), Trezeguet came to River Plate at a time the club was in a horrible shape so he of course did not win a Libertadores, De Rossi was somewhat close because was playing for Boca Juniors in 2019 when the club lost against River Plate in the Libertadores semifinals.\n\nEDIT: I was wrong, Dida was the first player to achieve that. He won Brasileirao Serie A, Copa do Brasil and Libertadores with Cruzeiro and Corinthians and Copa Italia, Italian Serie A and Champions League with Milan, also Club World Cup with both Corinthians and Milan, and of course won the WC 2002, Confedereations 2005 and Copa America 1999.",

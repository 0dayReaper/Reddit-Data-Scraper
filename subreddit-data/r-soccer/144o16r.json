He won the PL POTY, Ligue1 POTY as a kid, twice, WC Silver Ball. The 14/15 and 16/17 season were the best I've seen a footballer beyond Messi/Ronaldo. This is all while he never played for goals and gave the bare minimum in training etc",

But, given it's the internet, suit yourself.\n\nI don't think people understand the amount of powerful and famous people that live in and around D.C., in many of our neighborhoods, and go to the same types of restaurants, bars, and clubs that we like to go to, as locals. On average, I probably see one or two famous/high-profile people a week - whether they live near me or they're out in the same area. Nothing new, we are used to it and give them our respect and their privacy.",

I\u2019d argue in the 2010s, no PL winning team had a player carry more of an offensive load than Hazard. And he did it twice. \n\nPlus his body took a beating every single game. He was THE most fouled player in Europe for several seasons and still continued to play the way he did, putting his ankles in harms way, until it gave out.\n\nHe was probably below average in in-season training in his mid-late 20s but he played every single minute of every single game for us. And at that point he\u2019s already racked up thousands of hours of reps as a child, on the field as a senior. Spending time with the physios probably made more sense after a tough game\n\nHonestly never feel like someone who didn\u2019t give a shit about football to me. He wasn\u2019t perfect, but he definitely cares",

It hasn't helped but it's well known he's also not the most motivated player out there. \n\nHe's said himself he doesn't have much drive to be the best he can be, if he gets a goal he relaxes and thinks \"job done\". He's become overweight at several points in his career. Former team-mates like Eto'o and Mikel have said he ate too much and called him the laziest player they know. \n\nHis former manager Mourinho said:\n\n&gt;You can only imagine what he could be with a super-professional attitude in training. He gets onto the pitch every morning and\u2026 he doesn\u2019t work much. When he gets onto the pitch you don\u2019t see the reflection of a week of work, you just see a reflection of his talent. In terms of his fitness, his speed, his condition, he would be a much better player if he trained properly. What you see is just the talent that got Eden to where he is.\n\nIt's hard not to interpret all that as him just not caring about football as much as he probably should. He's apparently a nice guy who likes playing football but that's it.",

I don't think he was fined or anything like that, either.\n\nThe stories were typically the opposite: Hazard was professional and the club and manager appreciated his commitment, but he didn't have the level to contribute anymore. That's why the club was never aggressive about kicking him out.",

Not helping is the injuries plus his transfer fee and number 7 so there were huge expectations on him.\n\nI wonder if any mid table EPL clubs can gamble on him based on his unplayable periods for Chelsea. With low or no expectations and hopefully healthy bill, he could turn out to be good again for perhaps a few years.",

The guy just couldn't stay healthy.\n\nThe Ancelotti era, where the manager looked at him for a bit, decided \"this ain't it\", and benched him pretty much forever.

It didn't.\n\nI just looked at his fbref stat for the last 2 seasons. His shots creating actions and goal creating actions are really high, almost on par with his period at Chelsea. \n\nObviously it's from a very small sample (this season he only managed to play in equivalent of 4.4 90mins) but if he can maintain that, I think he can still contribute, perhaps in mid table teams.",

The two defense were perfect for 90 minutes with Fiorentina dominating the game but because of injuries to the strikers \"i Viola\" couldn't do anything in the last third. In extra time we were too tired and Lecce managed to create chance after chance and deservedly scored in the last second. Also really good job from the ref, a couple small wrong choice but unbiased and controlled the game.\nPS: It's a little sad seeing a team win the Italian Youth league without a single Italian playing in that team.",

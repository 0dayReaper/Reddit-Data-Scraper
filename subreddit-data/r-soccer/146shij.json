Dortmund was the clear underdog against Juve (and [Ricken's goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poE5Vu4tc-4) will always be a classic.) And the less said about ManU's treble, the less chance for a Solksjaer corner goal.\n\nJuventus and Milan are the only \"predictable\" winners IMHO given how far ahead Italian club football was at the time.\n\nI fucking loved that decade of UCL.",

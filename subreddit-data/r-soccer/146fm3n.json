Maybe Napoli wouldn't have won without the moves made following his departure.\n\nHe did what he felt was best for himself and his family, so no bad feelings there.\n\nMLS also isn't as terrible as it used to be. American and Canadian player development has greatly improved and the league itself is very competitive.",

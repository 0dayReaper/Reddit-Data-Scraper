                    "comment": "According to the media, he was about to go to Newcastle for 25 million euros a few weeks ago. But when there were other offers, Fenerbah\u00e7e gave up selling for now. Arda wants to go if Jorge Jesus stays. If Jorge Jesus leaves, he may stay for another year. There are also clubs that see it as a risky transfer because the player is 18 years old. He filled the 1500th minute this season in this match. If we count the national team matches, he played for 1600 or something minutes. It's been the last 10 games or something, the first 11 starts and plays 80-90 minutes in most of them. 12 weeks ago he played just 600-700 minutes in this season. \n\nAccording to another journalist's claim, Fenerbah\u00e7e rejected Borussia Dortmund's offer of 27 million. Arda's family had also reported that they absolutely do not want Dortmund. It was mentioned in the news that Arda's family welcomed Ajax and Leipzig, but that the decision belonged to Arda. Since Fenerbah\u00e7e wants to make too many transfers, they can let Arda go to create financial resources.\n\nHe is not expected to go to bigger teams at the moment. Napoli is the most likely candidate for me. It was even claimed before that Napoli thought of Ferdi Kad\u0131o\u011flu and Arda together. Maybe they can consider these 2 players after Eljif Elmas and Kim Min Jae. While there is a quota for foreign players, it does not seem easy for Fenerbah\u00e7e to send 2 Turkish players at once.",

Or they may not think he has Dortmund-level athleticism yet. They may think that Dortmund's style of play consists of very athletic players. That's why they can be suspicious about the Premier League too. Players close to Arda's age take 15-20 minutes in the Premier League. Only Buonanotte and Garnacho are over 500 minutes, but they are both 1 year older than Arda. \n\nArda is a very technical and talented player, but he is not a very fast runner. His physical capacity is not very strong either. Maybe they'll consider Dortmund after Bellingham leaves. They may also think that Leipzig and Ajax will both find a chance and move from these clubs to other clubs. It is more difficult to get a chance in Dortmund and to go to a higher level club than in Dortmund.Dortmund is already very high level club. I think he wants to play regularly.",

Even going to watch decent teams playing at a good level like Teutonia, they were playing on mud or gravel flats. My work started a 7 a side team to compete locally, expecting to play on grass or 4g pitches, and again, it was just a mud heap and the referee did a sweep of the pitch before the game for broken glass. We ended up playing our own self-organised games at an indoor football centre 20 minutes south of the city, and even then these facilities were really rough and worn out. I don't understand how Germany so consistently produces world-beating talent, because finding places to play was much harder than in Scotland or England for me, and tbh the whole UK has its own national debate on a lack of decent pitches.\n\nEdit: just saw you were negatively comapring the UK to Germany, sorry! That's funny, because I had the opposite experience, where finding a decent pitch in Hamburg was a nightmare. But yeh, the UK has a dearth of good places, so many good pitches have been built on in the last ten years.",

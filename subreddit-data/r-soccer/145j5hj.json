Teams drilled in this system defend the little half spaces well that KdB drops into and City can\u2019t work those overloads. Spurs and Wolves had very good records vs City with a back 3, Lyon did well against City, Chelsea under Tuchel, etc. They have enough quality in midfield to play through any City press too, or to stop it becoming an onslaught. \n\nI also thought City looked a lot like a side lacking rhythm against United last week. They didn\u2019t really connect in the final third and were uncharacteristically sloppy with the ball. Winning the title a week early meant City realistically went 2 straight weeks without meaningful games, and I always think they\u2019re best when they just play every 3 days and chalk up some momentum. \n\nI really don\u2019t think it\u2019s as straightforward as people think it will be. I hope I\u2019m wrong but I can see a really tight game.",

De Vrij was still a starter and Inzaghi even used Dimarco in the back 3, Onana was playing his first games and didn't even start in the league. Since then Inzaghi has changed the approach to the games because at the beginning he wanted to keep more possession but without having the players for that. Overall you can't judge the current team based on that matchup, but this doesn't mean Inter can't get destroyed tonight obviously.",

He tried 2 strikers with Aguero/Jesus and Sterling a few times though when Mendy was fit but that didn\u2019t last long of course.\n\nA one off game I can definitely see how Inter can win it, especially with that performance against United.",

City gets a ton of chances Haaland scores but it\u2019s dissalowed. Haaland gets in a low cross from Ak\u00e8 but Traore clears it off the line. De Bruyne takes a shot but cleared off the line by De Vrij. \n\nExtra time begins\n\nIn the 117th minute Haaland takes a shot but Onana saves, but he couldn\u2019t hold onto the ball and Haaland gets the rebound but somehow Onana denies him\n\n\nOn to pens\n\nInter are up 3-2 \n\nHaaland has to step up if he misses inter wins\u2026\n\n\nHe takes the pen \n\nSaved by Onana! \n\nInter are champions of Europe for the 4th time",

We know City will dominate possession and most of the game will be played in Inter's half, so it will come down to Inter's ability to defend and score on the break. Stones played as almost a free-roaming 10 in possession against United, and to devastating effect. I think the game will be decided by:\n\n1) Inter's ability to cope with his interplay around (and even in) the box, since he creates such an extreme overload by being there (and is exceptionally press resistant, reliable in possession, and creating space for the more dangerous players with his movement and one-twos), and: \n\n2) If he is able to get back in time when Inter break",

As long as inter suffocate the game plan and take the 0-0 to halftime the game will be as close as 50-50 it can get",

Anyone who has actually watched this inter side knows they step up against good teams and are in their best form all season. It\u2019s not a league 2 side here, it\u2019s experienced Internationals from the biggest countries in the world. City on the other hand have only won a single away game this entire CL campaign. They are big favorites, but favorites sometimes lose\u2026",

Outside of that maybe their 3-1 win against lazio in april. I cant take any win against milan as proof they will be a match up vs city because milan play with no midfield whilst city have one of the best midfields in world football. \n\nAlso beating juve 1-0 is not even worth mentioning considering how fucking dogshit they are against any club with a semblance of quality, and inter lost to this juve twice this season somehow. Absolutely mind boggling",

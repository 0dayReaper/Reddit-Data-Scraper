As with any of us our mental health can really impact performance and this, combined with the pressure of playing for the club of his dreams, really seemed to feed into his time at Celtic. One of my favourite Brighton players and hope he smashes it with Norwich.",

Celtic at the time needed a defender who was comfortable on the ball and could play out from the back, Duffy was neither of those things as was evident from his performances. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not the players fault he was asked to do things he clearly wasn\u2019t capable of, I\u2019d personally put it down to poor management and Celtic having a \u201che gets the club\u201d signing mentality during that deal (something Rangers fans know all too well)",

All of our attacking play comes through MGW so wasn't huge amounts for either fullback to do. I think Steve is trying to move us back to his preferred 5 at the back next year - we won promotion with it but were shredded early on last year with the amount of new faces learning their roles.\n\nLodi just became a very likeable, extremely hardworking, consistent performer. After his first couple of games he rarely gave a performance below 7.5/10. He sat deep and considering how much possession we gave opponents last year, they found it very difficult to get crosses in from either fullback zones.",

International football is a much lower level, and a lot of players look world class for their national teams despite not being so great such as Pogba and Matuidi",

His achievements were still very recent for us so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m talking about some distant past. \n\nAll I\u2019ve said is that for us, Jorginho was the better player. We haven\u2019t seen anything to really suggest that Enzo is better than him. Our performances have dropped, we have a worse PPG, we score less and concede more, and struggle to maintain possession even against relegation level sides. Maybe you can chime in - how much has benfica really missed Enzo? How well has Chiquinho replaced his role?",

I think I recall the instance you\u2019re talking about and he got done ONCE and kept him quiet for the rest of the games, but of course he gets hounded for it. Happens to every defender. Happens to Hall about 5 times a game though if he happens to be in position to defend for a change",

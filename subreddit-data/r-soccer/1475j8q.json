The Andalusian team made good the 2-0 first leg win over Alav\u00e9s B, with a 1-0 victory in the second leg of the tie that provoked jubilation among the visiting fans. The curious thing is who the scorer was: Francisco Franco.\n\nThe right winger, who wears 'Franco Jr.' on his shirt and is listed as 'Franco Santana', sealed the tie with a goal that has gone viral on social media, drawing the attention of many people to his name. A story that the player recently told in an interview to ElDesmarque.\n\n\"My name is after my father, who has the same name as me and decided to name me after him. On the back of my shirt he put Franco Jr. on me,\" the San Roque de Lepe player pointed out in that interview, in which he also revealed that they made jokes with the subject of his name.\n\n\"You can't imagine what they gave me when I joined C\u00e1diz. I take it well, as a joke. People like it, my teammates make some jokes, but I take it well. I'm very proud to carry this name because it's for my family,\" added Francisco, who often appears as 'Fran Franco'. A story at the Atl\u00e9tico Sanluque\u00f1o party.",

For the past few weeks he's been talking about how cool it is that a goalie can come down and score if they wanted to. I've told him it's not common and something that doesn't really happen. The story of the goalies father passing away grabbed his attention even further and he talked about how happy he was for him.. what an amazing experience to watch and it was his first",

When you signed up for an email it gave your username an unique Id that it stored in your browser and updates after login if it is not found. When you visit transfermarkt it will indicate you visited a site that had to deal with soccer/football and you looked up information regarding which clubs and players. The add service will then retrieve your Id and provide ads for products sold by companies or that use those players in ads. The companies that buy those ads pay more for an ad being served to a targeted user. \n\nHave you ever searched for a term or a place then seen ads selling travel or items from that location? Ads are the most common use but there are other uses for data mining.",

Might connect your reddit login, to your work computer, to that throwaway, then track to your personal. Not saying it would because it all costs money to do. I used to work within the automotive industry. The creepiest thing i've see was the ability to serve up vehicle specific tv spots. Say you were looking for a specific model online. If we connected your IP to your television subscription, we could then have 5 ads, each for a specific vehicle for company X. If company X  bought and used this service, we would show a vehicle specific ad that you searched for, during the time slot they bought. You and your neighbors could all see a car commercial for company X, but with the specific model you searched.",

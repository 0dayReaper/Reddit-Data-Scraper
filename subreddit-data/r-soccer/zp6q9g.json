That just doesn\u00b4t happen during a whole match and, if it does, it means your team is playing at a whole different level of intensity, which is what Argentina does. Now, how long can you keep that up against a team where most if not all the players are stronger, bigger and faster... from minute 70 Argentina reduced the offensive pressure and when the goals came they just couldn\u00b4t keep up anymore. The change of De Paul and Alvarez gave the team much needed air (and legs).",

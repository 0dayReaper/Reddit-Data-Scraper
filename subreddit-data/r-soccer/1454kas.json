Vinicius is better on the ball, better at dribbling, better at creating chances and better defensively as well with a much better work rate. Both are equally quick. Let's not forget Vinicius can score 25 goals a season as well in a variety of ways. He's elite in scoring and creating which makes him more versatile than Mbappe.",

Vinicius has the most dribbles in the world by far and is lethal when he's on the ball and has some historic dribbling numbers. \n\nHe has more than double the assists and chances created than Mbappe. How is Mbappe better in either of these categories?",

Vinicius' game is pretty straightforward: get his defender's back through speed or dribbling and score or pass. He is great at that and pretty much just that. Mbappe can do that but he is also a huge threat due to his shooting and his plays vary massively. \n\nAlso, if we look at xA (since you brought up data, let's use that) Mbappe has 0.25 to Vini's 0.30 this season.

Even if he didn\u2019t join Madrid, staying in PSG is just killing his growth.

He also tracks back. \n\nOf last Vini's semi final goals have come vs CIty in a counterattacking display. \n\nAlso Madrid progressed the ball a bit slower under Zidane, under Ancelotti its very quick.\n\n\nAlso great players can play in any system, even Messi Cristiano can fit in Simeone's defensive/offensive setup.

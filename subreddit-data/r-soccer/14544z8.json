                    "comment": "We don\u2019t have the funds for a big striker unless we sell, which is definitely a possibility. Plus, personally I feel there are more pressing issues to upgrade or solidify at the moment like the whole entire back line, midfield and wings. Back line needs overhaul, which is happening with the exception Molina(who knows how Reinildo will be after injury). The Midfield was inconsistent,very slow and weak getting steam rolled by lower level clubs. There\u2019s a lot question marks on the wings. Carrasco may leave, Lino may come back, Llorente can\u2019t stay healthy, and we\u2019re already talking about loaning out most of our young players again. I would like to see Morata and a healthy Memphis pairing for a season.",

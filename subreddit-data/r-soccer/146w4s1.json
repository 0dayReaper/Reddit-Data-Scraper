He has been there since 2011 and Real Madrid have bought countless defenders instead of making him a starter and he has never been an automatic starter under any manager.\n\nHe is a great utility player and every club should be so lucky to have someone like Nacho but do not kid yourself. Even at the national level, he was never called up to a major tournament. He is of great value to the club but Real Madrid is a cut above the rest in what they expect from players.",

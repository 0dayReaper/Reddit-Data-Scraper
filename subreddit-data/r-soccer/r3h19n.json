Just so you know, I was with the Eintracht [Frankfurt] in the first league and we still won against the Offenbachers [local rival], there I alone scored over 300 goals. Furthermore I can steal apples like no other dirtbag [ebbelwoi or apple wine is the national drink of Hessians], and the ashtrays aren't safe from me either. To me you're just another little pisser who wants to pee with the big dogs but can't even lift his leg. I'm always above, you can bet on that. [unsure about that sentence] And you think you can blabber nonsense about me on the internet? You can forget about it, sucker. While we're talking I already got my knifemen, who are canvassing every line in Kassel, you can bet on that, my boy. And this is going to be your last, then. Because then you can look at the radish from below, boy. Because I can be everywhere, everytime, and kill you in more ways than the Handk\u00e4se has music [[Handk\u00e4se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handk%C3%A4se) with \"music\" is a Hessian dish], and I can do it with just my hands and ashtrays. Because I don't just have years-long stadium experience, but I also know a few rowdies of the hooligans, they're gonna rough you up real good, until you can't look straight anymore, you little filthy bugger. If only you had known what terrible thing you unleashed upon yourself with your small \"funny\" talk, maybe you wouldn't have opened your snout so wide. But that's what you get now, now you're really gonna suffer, you dumb schmuck. I'll shit you full with wrath until you drown in it. [didn't know what Zonn is so interpreted it as Zorn - wrath/anger]. Ill rough you up, casper.\n\nany Hessian is free to correct any mistakes",

He was voted the 17th best player in the world in 2016, and for that I would have to put him just behind Dec.\n\nI believe that players that specialise in the defensive side of football are often overlooked when discussing who the best players are, so that is why I would put Rice just in front of Payet. Payet specialised in moments of brilliance, but his consistency was nowhere near the level of Rice, who puts in minimum 8/10 performances in every game.\n\nI'm only in my 20s, so it would be worth an older fan sharing their thoughts on where Di Canio and Brooking would rank in this list. However, I am a believer that most current premier league players would be classed as world class in Brooking's era, but for the time Brooking was very highly rated. My Dad speaks of him very highly.",

I think a lot of people don't realise how good he is at progressing the ball and just see him as another destroyer but IMO he would suit a myriad of playstyles, up to and including more possession orientated ones. \n\nAny United fan who thinks that he doesn't instantly take Fred, McTominay, VDBs minutes is delusional, and IMO he instantly fights for, and more than likely gets Eriksen's spot. We have Bruno for creativity, an #8 who's both comfortable receiving the ball in our defensive third *and* capable of carrying it into our attacking third *and* is excellent defensively? Fucking sign me up. \n\nHe would make a brilliant partner to Casemiro, not to mention that if needed, he can even fill in for Casemiro, although personally I think his best role would be one with the freedom to get forward. You don't have to be a #10 to be useful in the attacking phase and IMO while he isn't going to replicate what Eriksen does creatively, it's a smaller difference than people think, and he offers a tonne more defensively and in transition. \n\nI'd love it if we signed Rice and he would definitely be appreciated. Look at how the fans gush over Bruno, Martinez, Casemiro etc. Any player who has a combination of intensity and talent will be adored, even if people are (incorrectly) underwhelmed at first, he'd have them singing after 5 games. He's categorically **not** overrated.",

To use your parlance, I don't this he is overrated.  Miss rated or misunderstood perhaps.\n\nI'm probably going to get downvoted for this but I'm genuinely okay with it and I'm going to say it anyway.  His touch and passing isn't good enough to perform in the way your suggesting. \n\n&gt;Id love it if we signed Rice and he would definitely be appreciated. Look at how the fans gush over Bruno, Martinez, Casemiro etc.  He would make a brilliant partner to Casemiro\n\nThe things that those guys you have listed have in common is that they are all technically good and have passing ability Rice just doesn't.  I feel like not enough people talking about him actually watch him play.  He miss controls the ball a lot.  His physicality usually gets him out of trouble but it baffles me how this isn't talked about more.  \n\nThe media and therefore a portion of the fanbase has this idea about Rice that just doesn't match reality.  He isn't a scoring midfielder.  He isn't a box-to-box player who will bag a bunch of goals arriving late.  He also isn't a playmaker of any sort.  He simply doesn't have the range of passing or vision for it.  He does other things very well but the type of play you are talking about is not one of them.  His qualities lie in his reading of the game and his physicality.",

When did I mention his passing? When I say \"progressing the ball\" I don't mean only by passing it, I also mean ball carrying, and Rice is an adept ball carrier. I used the Eriksen comparison to try and hammer the point home, yes, he *isn't* a player with the technical ability of someone like Eriksen, but I still think that he would be more impactful even to our attack. \n\nI've watched him a lot, he is a *huge* part of West Ham's build up and is always involved in their attacking plays. You shouldn't have to be the person who directly scores/assists to be recognised as an integral part of how a team constructs attacks. I don't know how you can watch him play and think that he can't play as an #8 for most teams tbh. \n\nI don't think I implied anywhere that I think Rice is a great passer, nor that he's creative, that's why I said \"we have Bruno for creativity\" I'm implying that I think he'd work well with us precisely because we have someone who's so creative, we wouldn't depend on Rice to create. \n \nI don't even necessarily disagree with some of the criticisms you've put forward, there are plenty of players with far better technical ability than Rice, I don't think he's a perfect player, but he *is* adept defensively and carrying the ball from deep, and he's definitely good enough with the ball to play in a team that wants more possession. \n\n&gt; The media and therefore a portion of the fanbase has this idea about Rice that just doesn't match reality.  He isn't a scoring midfielder.  He isn't a box-to-box player who will bag a bunch of goals arriving late.  He also isn't a playmaker of any sort.  He simply doesn't have the range of passing or vision for it.\n\nOK? That's why I never said \"we should sign Rice because of his late runs in the box and vision\"? \n\n&gt; He does other things very well but the type of play you are talking about is not one of them.\n\nThe type of play I was talking about was both being able to progress the ball to help our attack and to contribute defensively as an #8, both of which he does at an elite level, why are you talking about whether or not he arrives late in the box or has the vision to play creative passes lol? \n\nAlso, Rice has been playing with more freedom and less like an \"anchor\" DM for like 2 years now, and he's improved immensely in that period. If you made this exact comment a couple years ago, I don't think I'd disagree that he might be overrated, but if you can't see how much better and more complete a player he's become in that time, I doubt I'll convince you now mate!",

No, but his touch is comparable to most central midfielders in world class teams. \n\nEvery West Ham fan has seen constant improvement in his ability over the past few years. \n\nYou being his underage coach (again, lmao) doesn't make you more knowledgeable of his ability today. \n\nI'm his dad btw.",

For me, that's what football is about. Me and you could sign for City and get a trophy. But having a club adore you and appreciate you as much as Rice (and Kane) money can't buy that.

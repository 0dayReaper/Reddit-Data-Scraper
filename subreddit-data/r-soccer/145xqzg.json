The structure slightly changed:\n\n- About 180M\u20ac are the interest Bar\u00e7a has to pay during the construction. Bear in mind, repayment of the actual bond will start after stadium construction. One way or the other, this has to be paid. This probably gives investors the security that bar\u00e7a will be able to.\n\n\n- About 200M\u20ac of contingencies. Includes the worst case scenario: Limak unable to complete the stadium leading to a change of constructor. If all goes as planed, not a cent should be used.\n\n\n- About 50M\u20ac left to reach the 1500M\u20ac.\n\n\nIf anything, this gives me tranquility. Imagine doing everything at the same time, and then not having money in case something went worng. I.e. Nou Mestalla.",

Also, if the worst case scenario were to happen, the Palau would not be built with the 1450M that we borrowed, the club would need to ask for more. \n\nin the hypothetical that we build the Nou Palau too, that still leaves us 100-200M short for the office buildings, the hotel and the rest of the campus. \n\nAll I'm saying is, the board told everyone that the Palau was included as part of the construction works in the financing, and that is a lie. That's what they've should've done, choose the right project or modify the one chosen by the board before them, calculate the extra revenue that it would generate, etc. Just like they did with the Camp Nou.",

The instalments could also be variable, the reports are not in agreement on that either. The only thing that doesn't seem to be disputed so far is that the loan could be restructured after just five years. There also seems to be no mortgage, guarantee against assets or collateral. Which is a bit strange.\n\nYou are right about one thing though, there doesnt seem to be a specific breakdown of the allocation of the loan. There is no budget, not anything that has been made public anyway. There are only some promises and assurances.\n\nThe suit seems to be mostly procedural though, it doesn't appear to cover the specifics of the renovation proposal at this point. But maybe that is something that will follow after the documents are filed in court and become public.",

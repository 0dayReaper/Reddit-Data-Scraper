It can be intended both as a classification of strength and a codified probability for the outcome, for instance a ELO difference of 100 between the two teams is 64-36 probability split, difference of 200 is 76-24.\n\nFor those who want to read more, there are better ways to rank football squads. ELO doesn\u2019t really work as well for team sports, or for sports where the score can be an indicator of a team relative strength (i.e. winning 4-0 should be a bigger score gain than winning 1-0).\n\n-\t[Sports ratings on Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_rating_system)\n-\t[pi-ratings paper](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Development-of-the-pi-ratings-assuming_fig6_236944354)",

On the other hand, most La Liga teams are only considered to be in positions 51-100 in the overall rankings, meaning any wins against those teams score fewer ELO points.",

The elo system works better when groups aren't so segregated from one another. If the relative strength of La Liga has improved against the Premier League, Real Madrid and Barcelona can only prove that by having the opportunity to beat high ranking teams. Unfortunately that didn't happen this season because they didn't really play many high ranking teams and lost the games when they did. \n\nPSG are a good example. By underachieving in Europe for years their ELO has been kept low. If they had more opportunity to play the top teams the ELO rating would become more reflective of their actual standing.",

Madrid have a slightly better record against what is deemed to be much easier teams. Look at West Ham being relegation candidates for almost the entire season but ended up winning the Conference League.\n\nFor simplicity I\u2019ll just look at league points in the last 5 years to go further. Yes, Madrid are very successful but Liverpool are only a little lower and there\u2019s a small amount of games so the difference Champions League makes is much smaller and the group stage could even flip it.\n\nLiverpool 424 vs Madrid 403. Elo is a long term ranking not a single season ranking and it focuses purely on matches not trophies. That\u2019s why Liverpool, with the better results in harder games are above. Real are a quality side who show up when it matters but those one off occasions rank equally to the every week league game",

The only way one league should have more points than another is through point transfer between leagues through European matches.\n\nThe top 6-7 of each league get the chance to gain bring points to the league by beating competition in Europe, then the points can spread within their league when a lower team draws or beats them.\n\nBut EPL hasn't had dominant success in European competition over the last few years, so why would they have so many points?",

Burnley's results, for example, apparently go back to the 1950s.\n\nIn essence, if you beat a team that's rated higher than you, you win more points off them than you'd win if you beat a team that's rated lower than you. And if you lose to a team that's rated higher than you, then you give fewer points to them than if you lost to a team that has a lower rating than you. Elo point totals and changes are calculated in order to give rise to a probability interpretation.\n\nLast year Antwerp was on 1501 and Brugge was on 1647. Antwerp's now on 1625 and Brugge 1618. If I look at the league results, where most games were played, then I see Club Brugge's had a very bad season compared to last season, whilst Antwerp's significantly improved. The late losses to St Gillis, Genk (twice) and Antwerp at the end of the season seem to be the main difference. [You can see that here.](http://clubelo.com/Brugge)",

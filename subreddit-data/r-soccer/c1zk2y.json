I thought they were gonna die from the temps in orlando. \n\nQatar in nov is nice compared the sauna that a lot of the games in 1994 were played in and what 2026 will be playeed in assuming a june/july tourny. \n\nand we learneed nothing.   Houston, orlando, kansas, miami and montery mexico are all possible locations for 2026.  Alll are outtdoors and get really hot in june/july.",

Of course this event is in a much larger scale, since it involves many cities coordinating their efforts together, but it is not impossible. Portugal and Spain should do it together, we got the stadiums and a cooperation between both countries to host it seems doable. Portugal got at least 4 stadiums that would be ready for the WC - Porto, Benfica, Sporting and Braga stadiums - and in Spain Real, Atletico, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla and Bilbao probably. This makes 10 stadiums, more than enough.",

But England and Germany at least have good transportation links and a lot of hotels etc for fans and players already. London had the 2012 Olympics and Germany the 2006 WC, so it wouldn\u2019t be beyond those countries to produce something similar given they\u2019ve done a \u2018big event\u2019 recently. \n\nI think either of those two countries would produce a better 2022 if they were told at short notice than Qatar would with 12 years notice.",

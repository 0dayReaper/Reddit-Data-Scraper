Everything about this qualifying process for Italy was underwhelming. Are we really surprised?\n\nThe saddest part about all this is that Italy has talented players. Ventura just didn't pick them or put them in positions to thrive. Insigne literally sat there on a cooler. Unbelievable. The FIGC, who gave Ventura an extension, is just as culpable for this embarrassment.\n\nJune 7th, 2016: Gian Piero Ventura was named Coach of the Italian National Team. That\u2019s the day we failed to qualify for World Cup 2018.",

    "postText": "Britain has two aircraft carriers with no planes for them, because we're idiots.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth-class_aircraft_carrier\n\nThe flight deck is 284 x 73m, they each have a crew compliment of 679. And they're not doing anything.\n\n284x73m, twice, is comfortably four football pitches.\n\n20 Premier League teams, squads of 25, that's 500. Let's say each team gets an allowance of another 25 staff. 1,000, with 358 left over. Plenty of room for camera crew, technical sorts.\n\nTwo week testing and quarantine period, we move the Premier League off-shore, I collect my OBE for services to British sports. Done.",

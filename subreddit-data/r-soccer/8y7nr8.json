Fair play and \"not looking like a fucking cunt\" aside - as a soccer player on *any* level you know that the ref has the last word. Period. He decides when to start or stop the play. He decides what goes and what doesn't. You cannot decide for yourself to just resume playing when noone's looking, when the other team isn't even on the field and the ref hasn't given you the whistle.\n\nLike... a 6yr old who played soccer in a club for a month would know that. That whole scene was so fucking absurd I can't even.",

It happens mostly in amateur because the ref needs to have more control since he has no ref team. So usually refs threaten you to hurry up after scoring, saying he'll start the game. I've never seen a ref actually allow it, but it might be this myth just stays with players all their lives and through professional even. At least it's my two cents because I played for like 25 years and just realized yesterday this wasn't an actual rule either. Plus add in the stage and the desperation and you get this sad excuse for an attempt at goal lmao. ",

I like making highlight threads, I think it\u2019s fun to do. If they\u2019re not a highlight I\u2019ll just delete them myself.\n\nBut it\u2019s ridiculous to have a couple mods (spass and that 9 guy) moderate when they\u2019re clearly awful at it. ",

Jesse \"Dab University\" Lingard has always been a clown but I expected better from Rashford.\n\nFor all the talk of progress this tournament with new tactics and a young generation coming through, England still have an infantile, kick and rush footballing mentality. This is the sort of stunt you'd pull when you're 10 years old and down the park.\n\nSo much for three brave lions!",

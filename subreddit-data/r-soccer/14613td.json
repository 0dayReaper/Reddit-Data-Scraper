            "comment": "Haverfordwest County AFC are delighted to announce the signing of midfielder Tyrese Owen.\r  \n\r  \nThe 23-year-old links up with the Bluebirds on a one-year deal, having most recently played for Slough Town in the Vanarama National League South.\r  \n\r  \nOwen, who plays in midfield but can also operate in the defensive line, featured 33 times for Kingstonian in the Isthmian League Premier last season, with the latter part of his time with The Ks spent on dual registration with Slough.\r  \n\r  \nAn imposing figure at 6ft 6in, Owen played a significant role in Kingstonian\u2019s 2022-23 campaign, as he netted 10 goals in 33 appearances throughout the course of the season, helping the southwest London side to preserve their place in the seventh tier of English football.\r  \n\r  \nHaving also represented the likes of Hemel Hempstead Town, Haringey Borough and Carshalton Athletic, Owen has picked up plenty of experience, and will offer an added dimension to the Bluebirds midfield.\r  \n\r  \nWhile capable of offering a physical presence in the midfield \u2013 something which the JD Cymru Premier demands \u2013 his technical ability also catches the eye, with his willingness to beat players with his quick feet being another important attribute.\r  \n\r  \nTyrese will join up with the club ahead of the start of our pre-season preparations, as we begin to gear up for our first European campaign in 19 years, and we look forward to having him on board for what promises to be an exciting 2023-24 season!\r  \n\r  \nCommenting on the signing, manager Tony Pennock said: \u201cTyrese is a ball-carrying midfielder, which is exactly what we\u2019ve been looking for, so we\u2019re extremely pleased to get him in.\r  \n\u201cHis path into football was slightly different, he didn\u2019t come through an academy system as such. But, he has spent time out in Sweden, which speaks volumes of his attitude and commitment.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHeight is an area we aren\u2019t particularly blessed in, so Tyrese will certainly help the team out in that regard.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHaving lost some experience this summer, it was important we went some way to rectifying this, and Tyrese coming in will help to do just that.\u201d",

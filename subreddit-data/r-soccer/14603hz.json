We have seen with China that just giving ridiculous wages will not attract talents in your league. Because the CSL was still considered unattractive to most players. My guess is that this is an expensive publicity stunt to make the league attractive to players. Ronaldo has been talking BS recently about how the level there was high and they would be one of the best very soon. That is obviously a paid endorsement imo. \n\nSo what is the economic incentive? Saud A's economy is in danger with the decarbonization trend. Therefore, they are investing heavily in diversifying their economy. Sports entertainment is one of such areas where they see their future. They want to get that PL TV money in the future. But offering high wages alone is not enough. Players still prefer Europe even if they could earn more in the Middle East. But now, everyone is talking about S.A and their outrageous wages. This is the way to do it according to mainstream business practices. When you cannot produce a better product than your competitor, you can still beat them if you spend a lot in marketing. Look at the pharmaceutical companies where their products aren't really that superior to the generic medication on the market. Those who spend shit tons on marketing get the most of the market share. \n\nFor them, spending 1 or 2bns a year on marketing for a while is better than doing nothing with it and having no revenue in the future. They have too much money and too few places to invest in. So they spend big on their choices. S.A was a big investor in Softbank's first vision fund.",

All it takes is a couple of comments with a few upvotes, which are naturally supported in the immediate aftermath of a bad result, and neutrals who very understandably watch the team very occasionally, have their biases confirmed on that extremely small sample set and they wrongly extrapolate them over the entire season.\n\nIt's true that Carlo still trusts experience over youth in the biggest of games but it's not unfair given the quality they still have and their experience, which is a difference maker in those very crucial moments in European nights. [Here is the list of minutes played over the last season (tap on the header of the minutes column to sort it if it isn't pre-sorted).](https://www.transfermarkt.co.in/real-madrid/leistungsdaten/verein/418) I have seen people claim vehemently here that Tchouam\u00e9ni has been a disappointment and barely received any minutes, that Luka was run into the ground (in general but especially when he was injured in the lead up to City), that Fede is the most overrated player in the world who hit form for a few games and was propped up by the Madrid hype machine, that Karim had a poor season, Vini (and especially) Rodrygo are insane finishers (none of the 3 of Karim, Vini, Rodrygo are but Rodrygo massively underperformed his xG which is where we suffered in la Liga, especially during Karim's absence; but people have seen him during CL where he often comes from the bench against teams that are infinitely more open than the teams in La Liga) etc. etc.\n\nJust speaking of the minutes, Fede played 40% **more** minutes than Luka and Tchouam\u00e9ni was in the same ball park as Luka. Camavinga also had almost 1/6 more minutes than Luka.",

Last season in the knockouts we were -6 when it comes to goals with our starters and turned the game around with the younger players. You need legs, you just can't compete otherwise and with both modric and kroos on the pitch you can clearly see it with your own eyes.",

Carlo is stubborn as fuck and if he stays he is going to keep playing favorites. For example Tchoumeni had some struggles with injury/sickness in january after the world cup and after that he never got the chance to come back into form because Carlo just kept benching him, but even \"out of form\" he wasn't even bad. Meanwhile Fede was even worse since the worldcup, absolutely horrible in a lot of games and he kept starting even when injured.",

With the amount of games the top players play, there is bound to be a burn-out phase were performances drop. Real just had the problem that a lot of their pivotal players were going through bad spells after the world cup.\n\nThere's not really something you can do about it. Guardiola has managed it, admittedly, but that has led to players wanting to leave after a few seasons. Which results in clubs needing to buy replacements, who take time to get up to speed and a drop in results. It's the cyclical nature of football.",

We lost 3 games in a row against Barca and he tried the same thing over and over again until in the 4th game against a Barca missing important players it worked out, so now in his head we were just \"unlucky\" in the games before and everything is fine. Im also in general a little bit in the camp that i want us to play a bit more proactive, with the young midfielders and young brazilian attackers not playing a pressing game is malpractice, but carlo can't coach that. Its going to get even worse next season with Bellingham in the squad. We are still going to give up initiative in the big games and it will piss me off.",

In my view it's excellent coaching to make use of Benzema's other qualities and try to hide his weaknesses by being less proactive.\n\n&gt;but carlo can't coach that\n\nI haven't seen his teams play that way yeah, even his Napoli was less proactive than the Sarri version. \n\n&gt;Its going to get even worse next season with Bellingham in the squad. We are still going to give up initiative in the big games and it will piss me off.\n\nIsn't that a bit in the nature of Real? For a proactive playstyle you need a coach who can mould compatible players together, and for Real the players are more important, so the coach takes a more backseat role. It has worked well in terms of cups.",

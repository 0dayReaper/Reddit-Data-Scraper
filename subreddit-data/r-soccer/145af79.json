            "comment": "&gt; Liverpool\u2019s pursuit of Mac Allister was helped by their long-standing relationship with the agent Juan Gemelli, who represents him alongside the player\u2019s father Carlos. He also looks after Alexis\u2019 older brothers Kevin and Francis, who play professionally in Argentina.\n\n\n&gt;Gemelli is the nephew of former agent Gustavo Arribas and assisted his uncle with Philippe Coutinho\u2019s transfer to Liverpool from Inter Milan in January 2013. He has been a frequent visitor to Merseyside in the decade since.\n\n&gt;Senior Anfield figures were impressed by the professionalism and attention to detail shown by Gemelli as the negotiations swiftly progressed.\n\nIt's fascinating how much happens behind closed doors that we are completely unaware of - stuff that makes these sort of deals happen",

A club always likes players like these, because they are hard working and hungry for success. But, that doesn\u2019t mean Liverpool will not sign other players who have great ability and did not have to struggle that much, e.g.- Alisson, Henderson.",

And still was wanted by Brighton?\n\nAmpadu has had decent to good time in Italy, even at relegation teams, I had even seen few higher up Italian clubs' fans want their club to go for him. And that after his last couple of loans have been kneejerk end of the window decisions from us, to teams where defensive players will just be used as punching bags by the league. Ofcourse now it's negative so all the wise comments will declare him useless.\n\nI always believe that fans of the loan team are worth more when talking about a youngster, but the way Norwich used Billy and their fans pinned their blame on a kid for their team being absolutely horrible, tells me these fans are highly biased and to take their view with a bit salt.\n\nAmpadu is a fine player, and in a bit more stable team we'll see it more. Not Chelsea level, but those who wanted him here never wanted him as a starter, but as a youngsters getting sime minutes to see if he deserves to stay or not. There is a difference.",

Its definitely a massive help that Pep himself played the position as he can break down the intricacies of the position in a way that someone without his experience cannot.",

In terms of statistics, his career (even his peak) has been fully eclipsed by Messi and Ronaldo, but the difference between his game and theirs is that those two seem to have a much more clean and efficient style, which is still entertaining, but Ronaldinho had that playfulness and flair to his game that really hasn't been matched yet by anyone since.  If I had the choice of going out every weekend to watch one of these three at their best, I'd pick Dino hands down.",

Ronaldinho looked like he was having fun and was always smiling. Neymar, on the other hand, when he isn't getting fouled and rolling around, raising his hands at the ref, bumping chests with opposing players, and acting like a jackass towards his own teammates, then.... He and Ronaldinho look alike. Neymar is a man baby. ",

But, again, his recent antics made me view him in a different light. He always had this thought about leaving BVB but he kept it professional for most of the time. Hopefully he'll shine at Arsenal, would be great for him and soccer in general. He's an incredible striker, very fast and still finds artistic ways to get the ball into the net when he has his mind straight. One of those players where the french commentary will go \"oh lala lalaa\" for many goals he scores.",

                    "comment": "I'm Atleticano. He played for my club for two years, from mid-2012 to mid-2014. I probably watched him in the stadium twenty or so times. He was a beast. A true legend.\n\nIn 2011, six months before he came to our club, we lost a pretty important match to Cruzeiro, our biggest rivals. The score? 6-1. Had we won we would've probably relegated them. They won and stayed in S\u00e9rie A. We were and are mocked relentlessly until today. It hurt a lot. \n\nSix months later I go online and read that he just signed with my club after leaving Flamengo. What the fuck? At that point, his career was over. He had been involved in a lot of controversies in Rio. Partying too hard, not playing well most games. He was simply not giving a shit.\n\nI was against the signing. Most were. There was no fuss. No media shit show. He came to Cidade do Galo, put on the uniform and went to the pitch. That's it.\n\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmem-EbrXzE) is how it happened. (video in Portuguese)\n\nHis first match was against Palmeiras. We won, 0-1. Bernard (today at Shakhtar) had an assist and J\u00f4 (that one from Manchester City) scored the winning goal.\n\nSlowly he started showing the player everyone knew him to be. A fucking genius. Unpredictable, entertaining, skillful. Ronaldinho was fun and he played for my club. \n\nHe scored his first goal in a penalty, against N\u00e1utico. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XnqVDQY5jg)'s the video: \n\nHis first goal in a really big game was in our local derby. And what a gola\u00e7o it was. To this day one of my favorites. It was very barcelona-era like, as you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMoOKayH4E)\n\nThen came his first masterpiece. But first, you need a like backstory. He lost his dad at a young age and Assis, his brother/agent/dad took over. He was is very connected to his family and, back in 2012, his mom was battling cancer. The fans hear about it and put up a big sign showing him our support. He was clearly touched by it and proceeded to play one of his best games careerwise. I shit you not. He did everything. It was magical. You can see the highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkkTW3dt6IY) \n\n[Here](http://s.glbimg.com/es/ge/f/original/2012/09/23/torcidaatleticomg_cristianomonteiro_tvglobominas.jpg)'s the sign for his mom: \n\nIt reads \"faith in God\".\n\nBut he is Ronaldinho and that didn't change him. While playing he also threw earth-shattering parties. Got drunk very often, showed up late and whatnot. Our president wanted him gone. Some players, led by Victor (my username is because of him) and L\u00e9o Silva asked the president to give him a chance a chance he was given.\n\nHe was a beast in the next match, of course. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeqYIRdsYn8) are the highlights\n\nThe year ended.\n\n2013 comes and with it Libertadores.\n\nI won't get into many details for each match because this post is already awfully long. I'll summarize his feats with a few words instead.\n\nGalo 2 x 1 S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n[I'm thirsty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuFa154QgJM) \n\nI was about 30 feet from him. It was insane.\n\nArsenal de Sarandi 2 x 5 Galo\n\n[A great assist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-E7K7TqSqw) \n\nThe Strongest 1 x 2 Galo\n\n[A bolivian national](http://s2.glbimg.com/Ewk8fIVT5rdH2G_Ytgko1U4XM-KKz6cH-Wxl1rfxoxOhipm7Am1ft2u-MM8sVTxW/s.glbimg.com/es/ge/f/original/2013/03/12/ronaldinho_leosimonini.jpg)\n\nGalo 5 x 2 Arsenal de Sarandi\n\n[One of his most beautiful goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha8pnpKmHF8) \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo 1 x 2 Galo\n\n[AQUI \u00c9 GALO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwmAgGcVUJU) \n\nHe didn't play so well during the quarter, semi and finals. Don't get me wrong, though. He was still important, but far less than he had been up until that point.\n\nWe were Libertadores champions (I was at the stadium, paid 50% of my monthly salary for two tickets with a scalper, best decision of my life) I watched the match with my best friend and wife. It was glorious.\n\nThen there was Raja and all that fuckup. Don't want to talk about it.\n\nCame 2014 and he wasn't as good as he had been. Started partying again, got fatter and started to, believe it or not, piss some of us fans off. \n\nHis last match was in Recopa, against Lan\u00fas. He wasn't the most important of all players but did a great job. This is his last [picture](http://www.novacruzoficialrn.com.br/images/noticias/2551/no-twitter-r10-fala-em-tom-de-despedida-galo-vai-estar-sempre-no-meu-coracao1406288510.jpg) in the pitch.\n\nYep, that's Jemerson in the back. Miss him every day.\n\n---\n\nI fucking love Ronaldinho and I'll defend him to death. A true legend. The most entertaining player to ever walk this Earth. Will forever be missed here in Minas Gerais.\n\nI'll forever be thankful for having had the opportunity to watch him so many times. Vai pra gandaia, Bruxo. Voc\u00ea merece.\n\n",

Match reports of Garrincha's time said that he would often skin a full-back, stop the ball, run back at the full-back and skin him again just for the fun of it.   \n\nBut of the past 20-25 years, I would say Jay Jay best pure entertainer, and Ronaldinho best entertainer who also combined it with purpose.

But he was played every week with the instructions of pretty much \"just do whatever\". Which meant he'd often forget the context of the match - he famously thought Brazil would have to play all the teams again after they beat Sweden in the 58 final - and so he'd end up just doing tricks and skills for the fun of it.  \n\nHe really was a legendary figure, and one of Brazil's most tragic characters sadly",

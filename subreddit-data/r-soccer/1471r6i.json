I've watched him in a couple of games. \n\nWhat I've deduced from the games. His main strength is his speed. Which he relies on it, a lot. His positioning and decision making, and sometimes passing can get him in a lot of problems. He is prone to mistakes. But I guess that's kinda normal due to his age. He is still an uncut diamon so to say. There is potential in him. \n\nIn my opinion, Barca splashed a lot of money for an unproven, 2nd division, player. They could've gotten him for cheaper in my opinion. 5M even for 1st division players is big money if you are not Dinamo Z.",

And if we believe one of our ITK who is right about our youth most times, then we have decided to not pursue him now as Poch thinks highly of Broja and Datro fofana and thinks he will have no place, which I frankly think is a mistake, but we are all imside Poch now, so. So we aren't even in the race now.",

The idea was always to quickly sell him, they spoke about it as soon as they signed him in winter. Their coach was singing loud praises and was comparing him to Gvardiol a few days ago.\n\nIs he really that good? Are they trustworthy? I am not sure. I hope he is just some get-rich-quick scheme but I may be biased. \n\nWhatever the case may be, they all are laughing on the way to the bank.",

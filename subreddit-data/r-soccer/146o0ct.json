Although it is of course sad to see any of our subscribers       struggling with their health - be it mental or physical - we have been greatly encouraged to see how supportive our community has been regarding these issues, and heartened that people have found /r/soccer a safe place in which they feel able to open up regarding issues which sadly do remain stigmatised in society at large. \n\nRegardless of the colour of your shirt (or the flair next to your username) we are all living, breathing human beings - and we all love the beautiful game. Everyone on /r/soccer deserves to be happy and well - so be kind. It can be a tough old world out there, and that kindness can go a long way.\n\nIf there's anything you would iike to get off your chest, we are listening.

I've narrowed it down to 3 options (out of 8) but it feels like each one has some pretty big downsides, and they kind of all cancel each other out in terms of pluses and minuses.

It's a really highly rated school with generally strong graduate outcomes, so I would theoretically be better positioned for a future career. It's also in a slightly cheaper city than where I live now, but is in the same basic region, roughly 45 minutes to an hour away. The company I work for also has a location there so I can easily transfer. **But** it's at the upper boundary of what I can afford and would mean paying more back in loans, so I'm basically gambling on whether or not it works out for me that that reputation pays off career-wise.\n\nThe second is a pretty good school, is roughly the same distance away but in the opposite direction, and they're offering me the most money so it would be the cheapest of the three to attend. My job also has a location there so again I can easily transfer. **But** it's in a more expensive area than where I already live right now, and every time I check listings I'm not sure that I can afford anywhere to live in the area on my current salary. It's semi-close enough that I could theoretically commute but there's the time commitment + actual commuting costs, so I don't want to do that forever. So I'm basically gambling on can I scrape enough together to not get evicted *or* can I find a higher paying job while I study.\n\nThe third is another good school (better than the second, worse than the first) and is marginally more expensive than the second school (they're actually pretty close on cost), but still substantially cheaper than my first choice school. The city that it's in is also substantially cheaper than the area where I live now; median rents are about 40% lower and there's just way more stock of affordable housing in general. **But** it's roughly six hours away, which is quite a big move. It's in a city I've been to before multiple times and just personally don't like very much; if I went I would definitely try to finish my degree and immediately fuck off. My job does not have any locations remotely nearby to there so I would absolutely have to find something new to do for work and quickly. There's the logistics involved of moving all my stuff that far, and having to just do normal day-to-day stuff like finding a new mechanic and a new vet for my dog and all that. Once I get settled it would definitely be much less of a burden than the other two, but it's a question of getting settled.\n\nOptions 2 and 3 are giving me a bit more time to make a decision but if I'm going to commit to my first choice I have to decide by the end of the day Friday, and I just keep going back and forth.",

Before I'd heard back from my first choice I was softly leaning towards option 3 because it's only about 2k total between 2 &amp; 3 by the time I finish my degree, but then city 3 is much cheaper. For comparison my first choice would be over 10k more than both. So it's a lot! But I really wanted to go there irrespective of its reputation, it's really the sort of environment I feel I do well in, and I keep trying to sort of psych myself up that the long term payoff is worth the higher cost but idk. Everything's just in a weird cost vs convenience equilibrium where nobody wins on both to make it nice and simple.",

You will regret it after some time and realise you wasted some good years.

            "comment": "City winning the Champions League was symbolically important to me. It feels kinda ridiculous to type this so I ask that you humour me.\n\nI live with a guy who is a Southend superfan. He lives and breathes Southend. He doesn't care about any other teams than Southend. He wants Southend to succeed at the expense of every other team in football. And I kinda understand that. Football, and all sport, are selfish by their very nature. You cannot succeed without a plethora of others failing. But that is where our opinions stop aligning.\n\nHe wants the super league to happen, simply because it would mean that the obscene, foreign autocrat money would have somewhere to fuck off to. It would, in theory, mean that Southend are more likely to win a game that is a meritocracy. He thinks that the country (and the sport) is so far gone that a super league would actually bring football back to many people. Of course, he didn't even mention the fans of the teams that would be in the super league.\n\nSo we watched the final last night, and I wanted Inter to win. Because I knew that, symbolically, City winning would be a watershed moment for football. It would prove beyond all doubt that you *can* get away with it, that you *can* pump infinite money into a club and win everything, that you *can* sportswash a country with an appalling human rights record. Last night, to me, set a precedent for clubs like PSG, Newcastle, and very possibly Manchester United. \n\nI know that last night wasn't the death of football. Football died probably about twenty years ago. Abramovic was obviously the first true football sugar daddy (and there's an argument to be made that United set the wheels in motion by beginning the true commercialisation of the sport), and he was the first man to 'buy the league'. But City *feels* different. So when they kept losing in spectacular fashion, when they were overwhelming favourites every year but still couldn't win, there was a part of me that felt like there was *something* keeping the integrity of the sport just about alive. I know that's ridiculous, before anyone mentions that.\n\nLast night broke that for me. Football has been a shining light in a very difficult few years for me, as I am not just a Southend fan but tbh probably a Liverpool fan since 2016. In moments of awful mental health, watching the Prem every week made me feel significantly better. I could focus my brain on at least two hours of football every week, and pretend that things were going to be okay. Because the world is fucked. My country is run by borderline fascists, the planet is on fire, there's always threat of a global war with Russia. I want to have a family in the future but I feel like I can't, in good conscience, bring a child into this world until there is some indication, some hope that I will be leaving them a place they can actually live in.\n\nI feel like football is a very simple window into the way the world works. The obscenely rich pay enormous amounts of money to win, and they will lie and cheat and steal in order to achieve their goals. There isn't much room for the little guy anymore, and when the little guy does find some success, it's not long before they either become one of the liars and cheaters, or get pushed back into their lane. \n\nMy flatmate doesn't care about any of this. He's completely nihilistic, completely resigned to everything that is going on in the world around him. If it doesn't concern Southend United, he's not interested. And that rubs me the wrong way. I want to care about things. If I can make the slightest positive difference to one person then that is what matters to me. I want to believe that there is hope for the future, because what's the point of anything if there isn't? Last night crumbled the facade that things might get better in our sport, and by extension our country and world. I know how ridiculously dramatic that is, but whatever. It felt symbolic. I just feel empty.",

                    "comment": "Very nice writeup. Allow me to offer a different perspective on this:\n\nI am a fan of a lower division South American club. The European sphere of football is completely beyond me. The only European football matches I watch all year are finals or really important matches; otherwise, I'd rather watch a local match, and I won't watch these finals if my club is playing at the same time. \n\nSure, Manchester City's owners are an obscenely oil-rich state with a dubious human rights record, but Inter's owners are an ultra-rich corporation backed by the Chinese Communist Party. It's not an underdog fighting against a giant.\n\nI completely understand your flatmate's football nihilism. I only care about what happens to Aldosivi, and to the Argentine league in general. I only get my European football news through this sub and my friends, I never actively seek them out unless it concerns a relevant Argentine player.\n\nI view the fans of these massive clubs with complete apathy. Them complaining about Saudi Arabia or other leagues taking all their players, because that's literally what happens to us when a player gets too good; we get pilfered every year in the dead middle of the season because of the disaligned calendars.\n\nThings will never get better down here. Even if Europe somehow manages to boot all of these mega-rich dubious owners out, aggressively enforces FFP, every single league moves to 50+1, etc. they'll still be ransacking our leagues for all their good players. It's just how the world is now, and unless a miracle happens and our economy improves the only league with a decent chance of retaining good players is Brazil.\n\nIn 1978, only 1 Argentine was playing in Europe. In 1986, it was 7. In 2022, only 1 of them was playing in Argentina, and that was a substitute goalkeeper.\n\nGame's been gone for a long time here. I can't do anything about it, so why care?",

So thank you. \n\nModern football to me depresses the hell out of me. As much as I don't want to follow it, I can't help it. \n\n\"There isn't much room for the little guy anymore, and when the little guy does find some success, it's not long before they either become one of the liars and cheaters, or get pushed back into their lane.\"\n\nIf I could give an extra like alone, it would be about this part. I've seen this a few times over the past few years and the epitome of it is Leicester City and what's happened to them since their win. If course, City had a hand in that too by buying Mahrez from them. But I've also seen it with my own club who I'm supposed to support when it doesn't depress me to - Leeds. \n\nPromotion to the Premier League was one of the worst things to happen to the club in my opinion. Not just because of how poorly they've performed, but because of how the big clubs picked the corpse of the club dry over the past 3 years. Worst of it, again, was Man City buying Phillips. Just to sit on the bench. And I argued with so many other fans about how bad it was and I was considered so extreme for hating it. \n\nMy interest in top flight football is so low and last night confirmed it for me. To the extent I'm considering abandoning the football league and concentrating on non league football or even getting back into Rugby.",

He has 5-6 good games in a season, otherwise mediocre.\n\nIn terms of attacking, the man is nearly finished. The team doesn't have a proper rw, so it's carvajal's responsibility to provide the width, and he's done a very poor job in offence.\n\nDefensively he's fine, ideally he should play the defensive rb/rcb role like azpilicueta did later in his career. But then a proper rw will be needed to balance the attack",

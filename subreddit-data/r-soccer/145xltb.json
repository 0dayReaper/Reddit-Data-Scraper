As a Swede our record was Alexander Isak for slightly less than \u20ac8 million a few years back, until Eintracht Frankfurt bought Hugo Larsson a few weeks back for \u20ac11,5 million.\n\nKind of telling how much Ajax actually paid for Zlatan when they bought him for about \u20ac7,8 million back in 2001. Adjusted for inflation it would be about \u20ac12 million today, but it's worth adding (as we all know) how much more expensive players are today in general. That kind of money for a Swedish club back in 2001 was basically insane, and I'm sure it was quite wild from an Ajax-supporter's perspective as well.",

Think that might play on the mental aspect. i love his workrate and he's quite unlucky so i havent given up on him, but he's a flop so far.\n\n17 mil down the drain, Yaremchuck misses again.",

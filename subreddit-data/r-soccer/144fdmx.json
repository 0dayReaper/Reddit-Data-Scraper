Rice has got a lot of the right attributes for that left 8 role - good ball carrier, defensively sound, tactically flexible, good work rate, decent passing and finishing. Much of the creativity would come from zinchenko, Odegaard and the wingers. Caicedo could potentially be used as an inverted rb as well, in case white/Saliba/zinchenko are injured while the backline resets.

I think it\u2019s a mix of not being the perfect fit for the system as an inverted full back and Tierney being too good (and not wanting) to come off the bench for most of the year. Because of that I\u2019d assume Arteta is willing to let him go if the price is right but I don\u2019t doubt that he would be happy to keep him. Tierney probably wants more minutes and Arteta can\u2019t promise him that",

We want our fullbacks to play as additional midfielders, coming inside to support build up.

He hasn\u2019t looked comfortable at all this year when he\u2019s been asked to play the underlapping role.\n\nArsenal fans all love and rate Tierney. We would not be upset to keep him as a backup because he is still a great player, but he seemingly wants to play. Newcastle are rumoured to be interested, which seems like a natural fit, and we\u2019ve set a price at \u00a330 million.",

Of course winning the thing would be nice but I don\u2019t think anyone (sensible) would be disappointed in a solid top 4 performance. It\u2019s all about guaranteeing champions league - cash flow and attracting big players.\n\nIt\u2019s valuable to be the only London club in the champions league.",

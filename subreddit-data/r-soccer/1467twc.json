I still remember the first time in Spanish class my Uruguayan teacher taught us the word \"tuvo\", but the whole time he was saying \"tubo\" and I couldn't understand why. It's even worse when they don't even pronounce the consonants at all, and Argentines and Uruguayans absolutely love doing that. \"Este abogado\" is usually pronounced \"ete aogao\", which makes communication in South American servers quite confusing when gaming online, even for a Brazilian like me who has lived near the border with both those countries most of his life and has met countless of their citizens. In European Portuguese they do the same thing with the vowels, so \"diferente\" becomes \"dfrent\", and that's also kinda annoying.\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese the pronunciation of each letter isn't always consistent and some vary immensely from one accent to another, but we usually pronounce every single letter and syllable in the word we are saying. I wish more languages did this.",

Languages diverge.\n\nThere might be some characteristic of Spanish that allows it to drop the v/b distinction or there might be something about Portuguese that doesn't allow for such a change. Or it might be that Spanish never had such distinction and it's something that Portuguese acquired on its own. [These people at asklinguistics can't seem to agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklinguistics/comments/z3vys2/did_spanish_lose_its_phonetic_bv_distinction_or/).\n\nAs for your difficulties, you seem to be hung up on the \"not pronouncing every single letter\" issue but I think that it's difficult to get used to people talking differently no matter what features they change. I've met people from Chile and I would swear they are talking a completely different language to what we speak in Buenos Aires. But it's Spanish, alright. And they are not omitting any sounds.",

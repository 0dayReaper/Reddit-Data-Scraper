Curious how they fit him, Enciso, Ferguson, Mitoma, Undav, Buonanotte, and March together going forward, their squad looks a bit forward heavy, especially so with Mac Allister/Colwill leaving and Caicedo/Estupinan linked away.",

I don't think Estupinan will leave this season with Mac and Caicedo looking likely to leave. They will probably need one more good cm, but they badly need reinforcements in defence - backups in cb, lb and a starting rb. Also maybe a gk, depending on their plan for steele cuz Sanchez looks to be leaving as well. They were rumoured for Boey and Fratessi but haven't seen much in regards to that lately",

Welbeck is on the verge of aging out but you also have to factor him in as he performed very well for them last year. \n\nBrighton fans seem split on Lamptey, some think he regain form, some think he's done. While we're naming names Cameron Peupion is another highly-rated midfielder but some fans online, but we also haven't seen that much out of him so I can't really assess as a neutral. I'm not sure if Milner's any more than a rotational option/locker room presence at his age, he looked thoroughly washed for Liverpool at times this year. I also don't rate Billy Gilmour but I know some of their fans do.",

Think they'll start off with Mitoma, Pedro, March behind Ferguson with Welbeck, Buonanotte, Enciso, Sarmiento and Undav as backups to cover the 4 attacking positions - good enough for rotation imo with all the games they have \n\nI think Lamptey is done as well, he's just had way too many injuries to ever be reliable as a starter for a team. I haven't seen much of Peupion as well so can't give an opinion there. I completely forgot about Billy Gilmour being at Brighton haha, he's done much better at Brighton than he did at Norwich so i think there is a player there. \nMilner is definitely a rotational player, and more likely to be used like Lallana has for Brighton. An experienced dressing room leader that can mentor the young guys.",

Like I said he did a great job there and Real were undoubtedly glad when he left - he\u2019s a fantastic coach for big clubs. But no that wasn\u2019t a challenge in the traditional sense, merely taking an already massive and very successful club to an even higher level of success and consistency.

He is the first Swiss player since 26 years who is in the starting 11 of a CL final and he wins it!  He more often than not is a stabilizing factor in the currently best club team in the world. \n\nFor sure Guardiola\u2019s coaching talent plays a role. Akanji himself though is considered a super smart guy, always willing to learn and adapt. Qualities which Pep loves\u2026 For me one of the stories of this City team in 2023.",

Because no matter how many UCLs they win they will never be treated as a big club by other fans. They have three-peated the PL and won the treble this season. The team might have gained your respect for their performance, but do u actually give 2 fucks about Man City the club? Do u actually think they are becoming bigger the same way liverpool would if they had done a 3peat and a treble? \n\nPeople use them for bantering other clubs. Instead of talking about city's 3peat everyone was talking about Arsenal's bottling. And they aren't gonna continue like this, because there are sugar daddies out there that are far richer than them. Most likely they will form some plastic rivalry with Newcastle and people will only compare those 2 instead of comparing either with other clubs. Also if this business of oil daddies keeps proving to be successful, who knows maybe big clubs sell themselves to Arabs as well. Man United is already in talks with Qatar isn't it.",

You can save 9 piss easy saves and let in one worldie while another keeper lets in 5 goals but they are all unsaveable. I can't remember all the goals in particular. Mbappe's second today was so good because he took it so early. He had so much space and time that 9/10 times you take it down and then shoot after, taking it early gave Martinez no time and because of his body shape it was harder to read/react to. It looked easier to get to than it really was, the others may have been the same.\n\nHis penalty saving though is straight up legendary, never seen better that I can recall. He waits for the shot before reacting which is why he went the right way basically every time and the distance he gets despite the late reaction is crazy good. \n\nLloris by comparison, mother fucker almost starts diving when they begin the run up, ludicrously easy to wait for him to start his dive before slowly passing it to the other side. I think Lloris was legit at 45 degrees by the time the final guy actually touched the ball.",

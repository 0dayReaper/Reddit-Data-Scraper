Poch thinks him to be one of the best strikers in the world\n- Many players look to leave the club with Chelsea targeting at least one midfielder (additions of three and six expected)\n- Caicedo is a name on the midfielder list\nReal targets replacements for Benzema, with Kane primary target\n- Kai is a player of interest for Real, Kovacic seems to be set to leave (having given permission to speak with ManCity)\n- RLC likely to leave with AC Milan most likely destination, Mount is wanted by ManU (Chelsea wants \u00a370M+@, ManU more likely to offer between \u00a350-60M)",

Description:

The football subreddit. 

News, results and discussion about the beautiful game.

Rules:

Follow reddiquette: You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/%20reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). Essentially, don't be an arsehole. On that note please downvote responsibly. The key to creating a strong, quality community is seeing past flairs and tolerating opinions you think are wrong.

Read the full version of r/soccer's rules [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/rules#wiki_community_rules)


No racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism or other offensive behaviour: No racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism or other offensive language will be tolerated on r/soccer. Do not abuse other users or troll. Offenders will attract bans. Inconsiderate use of tragedies, social and political issues is considered trolling.

Be on topic: This subreddit is for the discussion of soccer/football.  GIF requests, and threads about betting, video games, surveys, fantasy football, kits, line-ups, buying/selling/trading merchandise or tickets, fundraising, or meta discussion of /r/soccer are not allowed and will be removed. *Quotes/GIFs/videos should only be submitted if they are interesting for footballing reasons*. If you want to make a meta post then message the mods first. Historical posts are only allowed on anniversaries.

No shit-posting: Jokes, memes, TILs, ELI5s, reaction GIFs, comments disguised as submissions, novelty accounts, useless bots, trolling or other content detrimental to the subreddit will be removed.

No Duplicates: Check /r/soccer/new! Sometimes mods will allow the same news story to be posted if the new article offers new/valuable information that the previous thread didn't or the duplicate was submitted long enough after the original that readers may not have seen the original. As a rule of thumb, if you're not sure, then don't post a duplicate.

No NSFW content: Content with gore, nudity or sexual themes is not welcome.

You must link sources for news, quotes and stats: No URLs that obscure the actual source (e.g. URL shorteners, archiving sites, and tweets that just link to an article), screenshots where links suffice (e.g. a screenshot of a tweet instead of linking the tweet directly). Tweets must be from the direct source; post the original tweet, not a re-tweet or second hand source. Unverified tweets must mention who the author is (e.g. reporter for the Times, or player for X team).

Only valuable image and stat submissions: Images that promote newsworthy discussion are permitted (e.g. infographics) and images that are just 'look at this cool thing' are removed. See [the faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/faq#wiki_why_was_my_image_submission_removed.3F) for more details. Only very significant stats (eg: world records) will be allowed during matches. After matches, we'll be less strict, but statistics should be significant in some way, and otherwise should go in the post-match thread.

Please use factual and objective titles: Submissions may be removed if the title is too vague, inflammatory or partisan, or editorialized.

If you are posting a recent goal then you must mention the player and opposition, it's also preferred if you put the current score of the match in the title. If you post a video from the past then mention when it's from and what players/teams are involved. The more information the better.

All tweets must include the author's name in brackets at the start of the title: "[John Smith] ..."

No low-effort questions as top-level submissions: Low-effort questions (eg: questions that are answered with a simple search, comparison questions, questions that have an obvious answer rather than provoking discussion) are banned as top-level submissions. If you have a question you'd like to ask, please do so in that day's [Daily Discussion Thread](/r/soccer/search?q=flair%3ADaily+Discussion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new).

If you think your question was wrongly removed, then [message the mods](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsoccer)


Hard paywalled content should be summarised, but not copied.: We will allow hard paywalled content if the OP summarises the main points of the article within the comments. You may not copy-and-paste the article from the pay-walled site or provide links to sites that bypass paywalls. You should post the summary shortly after submitting the article, or your post will be removed. This includes links to tweets from the author in which their paywalled article is linked. A hard paywalled site is one that requires a subscription before viewing any articles.

No Baiting/Trolling: Comments made in bad faith to start arguments, derail discussion, and/or provoke other users are against the rules of the sub and will be removed. The moderation team reserves the right to take further action against the user if needed.

If you think your comment was removed or you were banned in error, please contact the mods through modmail

Follow the Submission Guidelines and use the correct Flair creating a new post.: In addition to the overall rules of the sub, remember that you also need to follow the [Submission Guidelines](https://new.reddit.com/r/soccer/wiki/rules/#wiki_submission_guidelines) when posting a new thread. There are 13 of them, so read them carefully so we don't need to remove your post and/or take further action.  
  
Also remember that we have a mandatory Flair system for posts that activate different Automod commands, so please use the right one when posting.

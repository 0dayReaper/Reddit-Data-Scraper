He's actually been tackled more than anyone else in the graph, 153 times to Mbappe's (2nd most) 109.\n\nEdit again: As pointed out in this thread Vini has carried into the penalty area 140 times, the next best is Salah with 87.",

Obviously, not everyone is the same.",

Doesn't get as many opportunities to drive into the box and less space, and he doesn't make nearly as many runs into or near the box. His dribbling is more geared towards making space to take advantage of his passing to play others into the positions Salah takes up.",

If you can't see that the way Messi and Salah entered the penalty box with the ball was vastly different even at the same age I don't know what to say. \n\nNowhere does my comment come remotely close to describing him as a deep lying playmaker (???), I don't even know what to say to that nonsense. The comparison was for forwards so when I say he makes less runs, it's in comparison to other forwards. His workrate is shite, we all know that",

Taking on and beating a midfielder or forward around the halfway line or just inside the other team's half is not the same thing as a successful take on that gets you into the penalty area with a chance to create a goal scoring opportunity.",

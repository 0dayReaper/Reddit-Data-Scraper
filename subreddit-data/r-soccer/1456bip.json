            "comment": "&gt;KV Kortrijk is selling defender Tsuyoshi Watanabe to AA Gent for 3.5 million. So much for the good news. On Monday, KVK will start preparations without a head coach, incoming transfers, chairman or CEO. Without a buyer, Kortrijk is a rudderless ship.  \n\n&gt;Owner Vincent Tan wants to sell the club, but because the Malaysian did not want to accept foreign offers to take over KVK, chairman Ronny Verhelst and general manager Matthias Leterme announced in late April that they would leave. \n\n&gt;Vincent Kompany's Burnley visited the club a few months ago. But Tan is pursuing other avenues. The Kaminski Group, among others, are said to be showing far-reaching interest. The Americans are keen to build a European football network. It is up to Tan to decide who it will be. The Malaysian bought KVK for \u20ac5 million at the time and is now hoping for a multiple of that amount. \n\n&gt;Kortrijk have not yet been able to appoint a new coach. Talks were already underway with several candidates, but everything depends on the new owner. The first training session is scheduled for Monday, which is why Joseph Akpala will take over from former coach Bernd Storck for the time being. The former striker of Charleroi, Club Brugge and KV Oostende, among others, acted as assistant coach last season and is now taking his first steps as head coach.  \n\n&gt;Transfers\n\n&gt;After a rock-solid season, Tsuyoshi Watanabe was hotly sought after on the transfer market. Hein Vanhaezebrouck, in particular, is a huge fan of the Japanese central defender. Hence, AA Gent plunked down 3.5 million (bonuses included). Besides Watanabe, other star players like Fa\u00efz Selemani and Abdelkahar Kadri also seem to be closing the door at KVK.\n\n&gt;On the incoming front, things are quiet in South-West Flanders for the time being. The great uncertainty makes it difficult to convince players to choose KV Kortrijk. The players and their agents want to know how things stand now - which makes sense. In any case, Akpala does not seem to welcome many people on Monday. Lease players Marin Wasinski, Dorian Dessoleil, Nikolas Dhyr, Oleksiy Sych, Satoshi Tanaka, Stjepan Loncar and Habib Keita returned to their parent club. Captain Kristof D'Haene said goodbye to professional football and Fa\u00efz Selemani, Nayel Mehssatou and David Henen have international commitments. \n\n&gt;The only positive is that Youssef Challouk will be back at the club. He was loaned out by KVK to RWDM and was one of last season's flagship players in the Challenger Pro League. So KVK still has a lot of work ahead of it, as barely a fat month before the start of the league, it still does not have new players, owner, coach, chairman and CEO. Time is running out.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",

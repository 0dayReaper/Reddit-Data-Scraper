First half year with us was basically getting fit and after that he made massive steps and was an important part for us almost winning the conference league.\n\nBut then also he does seem to see his opportunity in Arsenal and I doubt Arsenal gives a 4 year contract for someone they don\u2019t see as a first team prospect.",

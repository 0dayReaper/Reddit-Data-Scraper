That's BIG money for polish league team. It will lead to us (and other leagues) being eventually competitive enough to get CL groups more often, because you can attract players more easily to league that plays in Europe in spring.\n\nTLDR: I understand fans of top5 leagues being \"meh\" about LKE, because it's not big money, and it's not qualifying for CL. But for lower leagues like Ekstraklasa it's a ladder that WILL get us closer to top10 leagues in Europe.",

That is what Football is.\n\nI was happy when we got in ECL and enjoyed all of it. \n\nA dream come true, a life time wish fulfilled. Can't  believe I got to see West Ham lift a Cup.\n\nHopefully the prize money continues to grow, smaller league teams continue to make more, improving their teams and leagues. Making the ECL and EL even more competitive.",

If you polled I'm sure this would be the majority view\n\n2nd place is a memorable season but the novelty just doesn't last like a trophy does. Especially for a club going 43 years without a major trophy, it could very easily have been another 43 years. Arsenal aren't ending a significant drought, and they are above Conference level. So of course they wouldn't trade it. It's different for clubs like West Ham\n\n[Watch this](https://twitter.com/BBCBreakfast/status/1666689330692145153) and try say that this kid would trade that feeling for 2nd place and a couple CL games that end in disapointment. There is zero chance he has this level of emotion for 2nd. He would be over the moon sure, and he could gloat. But as soon as the next season gets started that feeling dies down. Seasons start fresh, trophies are forever\n\nHe and thousands of others are going to vividly remember last night for the rest of their lives. It is a solid part of their clubs history, if they never see another trophy lift at least they saw this. Qualifying for the CL only means something if you can actually win it or at the very least go deep and keep coming back to competition. They are not the kind of club that can do that (right now). They would have to be lunatics to trade this for that",

You don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem when a league has half of its teams at like 1/3 of the payroll as the top 5? You don\u2019t think the past 20 years minus the one offs of Blackburn and Leicester are like the same 4 teams? What type of league do u want where your cheering for your team to finish 8th lmao it\u2019s not competitive",

That being said there\u2019s a giant disparity between quality for mid and lower table teams compared to the top teams in the league.its a valid critisism that\u2019s brushed off by teams that are fans of mid to lower teams because they want to be part of the league with the top teams. It\u2019s not the best vs the best. On what earth do you want a league that the bottom 10 of the league is like a third of the payroll of the top 5 teams. It\u2019s not even fair and shouldnt be that way. \n\nAlso the Americans not understanding football culture is bullshit. How you guys view your teams is the same way we view our highschool/college teams. It\u2019s all fun and all but when it comes to pro sports it\u2019s not optimal. In our big 4 sports here we get behind our teams with just as much.",

If they win a championship, but not the National Championship, do you not celebrate because its not the top prize?\n\nYou try to win every competition you are put in. When you win it, its amazing. It doesn;t matter what it is, that is what sports is all about.\n\nYou mocked a tournament because it wasn't the TOP tournament. No sports fan would do that. Thats like saying \"LMAO thats just a PL title, not the World Cup\"",

This is a pat on the back sad trophy to win, but I may be west hams only trophy that it can actually compete for so go nuts. That being said my point is west ham shouldn\u2019t even be considered a professional team because it lack quality \n\nAlso a giant leap in logic. Your not listening to what I\u2019m saying.\n\nWe don\u2019t have championships and tournaments like this in the states. We don\u2019t do loser brackets and dogshit teams win nothing but better draft picks to even things out and create parity in a league. Since the way soccer operates, bad teams are essentially farmer teams where good teams go to buy players that could eventually emerge. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a sad reality that west ham can never actually compete for a legitimate trophy? One where they are beating the best? There\u2019s no route too that unless a crazy financial take over happens or the stars align. Like seriously how does it feel going into every season knowing that you have no shot at the title and have to worry about a potential relegation, where majority of teams play for draws and hold on for dear life against the top teams because they really don\u2019t have a lot of quality in there starting lineup?",

Although this is something that a few people have mentioned, so maybe there's fire to the smoke.\n\nSecond, it would be absolutely idiotic to sell him now (unless someone crazy enough pays us 30m for him or something). He still hasn't adapted to the team or the environment. Plus, it still remains to be seen if he actually fits Pioli's tactics.\n\nCharles isn't a CAM, which is where Pioli played him, and he isn't a RW. He's mostly a false 9 with some positional freedom. So will Pioli give him minutes over Giroud? (or Thuram if we actually get him).\n\nI would say give him another season and try to make the best out of this.

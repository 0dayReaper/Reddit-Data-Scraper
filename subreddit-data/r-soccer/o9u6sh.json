I've seen teams come back from bad performances etc many times, but I have never seen a team lead and play better for most of the match, be on the brink of winning it, miss a penalty, COMPLETELY COLLAPSE after that miss while their opponent suddenly starts playing world-class football. \n\nAnd then after all that somehow pick themselves back up, come back to within 1 goal, get the goal, lose it to offside decision, STILL manage to score in extra-time and then survive a scare of a Coman's shot hitting the bar. \n\nSimply crazy, crazy game.",

I wasn't one of the takers but standing on the pitch arms linked with my teammates is so anxiety inducing when you're waiting for the next penalty to be taken. \n\nAt like four different points either team could have won it, it was horrible knowing one kick and it could all be over. Thankfully we won it and it was one of the best feelings of my life but the nerves just from a fucking university tournament were insane. \n\nTo this day I still think about that shootout and little scenarios like \"what if our keeper dived the other way and we lost\". The margins between success and failure are so slim. Can't imagine the nerves during a shootout in a European or international cup final.",

Usually I support underdogs so I take my shirt bought from a souvenir shop in Bern 3 years ago and I 'infiltrated' among the Swiss. Their fans and their teams were awesome. They played real football and heart win over talent. I saw after missed penalty(in match) that they colapssed mentally and goal(s) were imminent. If they had scored from the penalty spot I don't think France can back in this game. France played nicely only 10-15 minutes after missed penalty when Swiss were groggy. But they manage somehow to get over this 3 goals conceded and to make it 3-3. Also neutral spectators switched from supporting Mbappe, Pogba and Griezmann(that's why they came) to support the real MVP of this game: entire football team of Switzerland. That was fantastic, that's what football is about. Chapeau bas, Switzerland, thank you for this amazing come back and good luck with Spain, I hope you cand advance to semifinal!",

I am aslo not super excited for someone who looked like he didn't even slightly give a toss\n\nHe is not getting in ahead of McGinn, Luiz, Ramsey or Kamara without proving himself a lot so he will be cheap deapth as a squad player. The midfield spine we have is the strongest area of our squad and the least in desperate need of imropving so a freebie makes sense I guess. Means we can go heavy into areas we need quality additions, RB, CF, wingers",

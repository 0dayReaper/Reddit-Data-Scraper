So basically no Americans. \n\n2 - Who will plow as much money as is humanly possible into a team to ensure they win. This disqualifies mere billionaires like Tony Bloom who owns Brighton because even he has a cap on how much he can spend. \n\n3 - Who's also isn't a James Bond-level villain. So no Middle Eastern oilmen, no Russian oligarchs, no shady Chinese businessmen, I assume cryptobillionaires and rogue states like North Korea are also out of the picture here.\n\nIt seems like everyone wants owners like the ones who own Brighton and Brentford but they have to be trillionaires as well.\n\nHere's the solutions, each one comes with a dilemma. None of them are perfect.\n\n1 - 50+1 like the Bundesliga\n\n2 - Salary caps like North American sports\n\n3 - Barring certain owners from being allowed to own football clubs - kinda like North American sports.\n\n4 - Do nothing, current environment is fine.",

I don't think it's staying in your lane as much as having common sense. \n\nI'm a biologist and have a PhD, and I can't for the love of god configure my wifi printer, same as I don't know shit about managing a football club. I would still give my opinion on how printers suck and HP should stick it up their arse, but even having more than layman knowledge about virology, I wouldn't just randomly speak about it in a public platform without taking the time to do proper research on it.",

So you're basically not just sharing your opinion, but actively influencing people eventhough you're not a specialist on the matter. That may be the viewers fault, but that's how people are wired. \n\nPlus the asymmetrical influence. There will always be different opinions, but only those who are currently embraced by the public will be shared, due to negative PR. Perfect example is Trump and Hillary Clinton in the last election. Trump got so much shit in the news, hardly any public figure openly wrote about him. Whereas a lot of stars openly supported Hillary. \n\nSo basically the vote count was only marginally favouring Hillary, but the narrative in media/on seocial networks suggested it would be 95 to 5 or something.",

Almost 100 years later, vast majority of the countries are not even doing the bare mininum to prevent ecological collapse due to global warming. \n\nNo one cares about experts.",

People don't often remember the specific of most people, they have a general idea of that person and will stick with it. And in Lebron's case, as long as the amount of good he brings triumph the bad's, then most wouldn't care. \n\nA great example for this would be when Micheal Jackson or (more recently) Kobe died, sure they had some shady shit in the past (MJ with the pedo or Kobe with the rape thing), but in the end, most people don't remember them for that. They remember them as good people that influenced others and bring the world together. \n\n&gt; they speak only when its a great PR move\n\nAnd this is why PR move ain't that bad. I'm sure most celebrities that say PR shit doesn't really care about the issues, but it doesn't matter to the mass. They will just see it as good actions and energize them, which in the end would mean a net positive.\n\nAnother example of this would be the ice bucket challenge. I'm pretty sure most people doing that shit don't even know what it stands for, but it still brought a lot of funds and awareness to the ALS than ever before. And I think that's all it matters.",

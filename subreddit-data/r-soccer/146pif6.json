Shankly built the club up and is rightly praised for that, but Paisley was the tactician, and was the one who kept them dominant for the best part of a decade when Shankly left. Look at other clubs and you can see how difficult that is when a long-serving and successful manager leaves - Man Utd, arsenal, and Forest are good examples of that.",

It's not a win for the so called little guy when one club has broken the rules that all the other clubs have followed (or attempted to follow to varying degrees of success), and while other clubs have either tried to live within their means or been punished for not doing so, one club has been able to run roughshod over the rules that others have abided by or been punished for breaching. Every other football fan should be fuming over this, because whether you agree or not with FFP rules, the rules *are* still in place and need to be adhered to whether you like it or not.",

City on the other hand are above the rules and will go around them not following what all other clubs had to do before them. They can\u2019t beat the actual teams by following the rules so they just ignore them so they can win. The team I am referring to is all teams that don\u2019t have 115 breaches. Arsenal United Liverpool have been hurt in England by them the most and Inter in Europe this year along with all other teams they beat. If they followed the same rules other clubs did and beat them then fair play but that\u2019s not what is happening. They already have the advantage of owners with unlimited funds which there are maybe only a couple other clubs in the world like that but on top of that cheat to make it even more fair.",

Anybody can always come up with good stats by changing some of the parameters (e.g. by picking the exact number of years that would fit your position). \n\nNo matter how you look at it, spending money has the strongest correlation with success. But this does not mean that I\u2019m discounting Fergie. Of course you need the manager who is able to optimize the available capital. For example, in the oil era before Pep, we won like 5 trophies. With Pep we have won  12 trophies. The managers in the oil era before Pep had access to the same capital that Pep did, but Pep has more than doubled the rate at which we win trophies. \n\nSo I am definitely not arguing that extremely talented managers do not have a significant impact. However, the club usually has to be among the big spenders if they are going to see any real sustained success regardless of how good the manager is",

His reputation was awful in France so he went to Leeds. Leeds weren't happy with him off the pitch either and shipped him off to Man Utd for the same price they bought him just to be rid of him. He only hit the heights he's now known for under Ferguson. \n\nJean-Pierre Papin was the top French striker of the early 90s and a star. Cantona was a Balotelli-like figure before he settled down at Man Utd. Now no one remembers Papin and everyone thinks Cantona was always the star player he was at Man Utd.\n\nYou'd be better off pointing to Andy Cole. 7m was ridiculous money at the time and he was coming off a 50 goal season with Newcastle. Cantona was a gamble that paid off and came from a club that didn't want him.",

The class of 92 weren't the spine of that early succes. United bought their leagues like everyone else and the academy graduates then developed into the spine as they then bought around them. United consistently spent lots of money for their titles and the teams trying to compete had to try and outspend them to catch up. Leeds, Blackburn, Newcastle, Arsenal and Liverpool all spent heavy and regularly took turns outspending united in summer windows just to compete. Only difference was when clubs could sustain the spending to compete like Chelsea and City as no one can naturally compete with the juggernaut that is United's commercial power.",

The league reformatted at the end of his first season, with St Mirren remaining in the second tier, which was then known as the First Division (a new top division called the Premier Division was created). Two years later we won the First Division, and were promoted to the Premier Division. It is also worth noting that St Mirren is historically a top flight club with resources and a fanbase requisite with a club of that size. Fergie did a good job as our manager, but we probably did have the second largest budget in that league that promotion season, behind only Dundee, and indeed in every other that he managed but the last, where we finished in the spot directly above relegation and both relegated teams (Ayr and Clydebank) were far smaller. It wasn't like he did miracles in Paisley like he did in Aberdeen (sadly).",

But a big signing was due by then as Di Maria was the only big name attacker they had bought in the 3 years before. Also Ozil and Higuain left for a combined 100 million. \nNext year James Rodriguez and Kroos joined. That's also right after Di Maria and Xabi Alonso for combined 90 million.\nSecond stint only spendings were Tchouamani and Canavinga. Madrid's aging midfield was long due. \n\nZidane\nSolid core didn't spend much in first stint. \nSecond stint got Hazard and Jovic mostly from the Ronaldo cash.\n\nThe end.",

He tore shit up and stormed off like a toddler having a tantrum because HE failed to succeed with this team. \n\nHe blamed all but himself. If he had an ounce of humility and said it was a group failure, then fair. But it was everyone else's fault but his. \n\n(And that's including Nuno's brief reign but expectations were far lower).",

Not only this year top four, the other teams like Brighton, Chelsea and Villa will do better than Spurs due to stability &amp; proven coach in Chelsea.

Did anyone think last season that that Arsenal team was good enough to challenge for the title? If Kane stays and Tottenham buy a centre-back and maybe a more offensive-minded midfielder, we're in the conversation for top 4. We were 4th for a decent part of the season until we collapsed in the last 10 games. Add in the lack of European football, and I think it's not implausible that we do better than that.",

If he gets another chance at a top club he will absolutely have to earn it, just like getting the job at Everton off the back of his Chelsea time.

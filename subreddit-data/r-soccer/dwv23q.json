Markku Kanerva, the national team's current coach. Their captain back then? Tim Sparv, the national team's current captain. Two men leading Finland's football twice to the uncharted glory.\n\nTheir Euro 2009 squad also included Teemu Pukki, Joona Toivio and Jukka Raitala from this current national team, all irreplaceable players in the starting lineup now.",

But on the Sunday of the festival all bands stopped playing and the organisers distributed televisions around the festival area and everyone was watching the fairytale final. And the place went fucking nuts. I became a supporter of the Danish team then and there. Fast forward to 2003, hockey World Championships in Finland, 2003. We lost to the Danes and had a mediocre tournament overall but I had so much fun drinking with the Danish fans. Bought the Danish national team hockey jersey. Forward to Euro 2004, me and my friend drove from Finland to Braga Portugal in a 15 year old Toyota van to support Denmark, saw them play Bulgaria and Italy. Wore my hockey jersey, ended up talking to a Danish dude who had played for the national team. Good times, hygge \n\nTL;DR: Danes are awesome but finally I get to support my own team. Still have and wear the jersey.",

            "comment": "As i posted in game thread. This is what the beautiful game of football is we all love about. A Small nation going through for the first time in our history and celebrating it like king of the worlds right now with vodka and beer flowing through every city!! I understand some people are annoyed about the new change but as we smaller countries we dont give a FUCK about those opinions. You have to understand that football is loved everywhere in the world and if more nations is available for competitions its more spectators etc. And excitement for the games! Please dont make us feel bad about our achievement and be happy for us!",

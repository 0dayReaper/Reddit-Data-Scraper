And it would make more sense to me that we're trying to keep Endo when Schiele hasn't even played a system where he actually fits in. Still think he could be good for us if we play a system where he actually fits in though, I'm just afraid that we're going to end up keeping him to play in Pherais position when he leaves despite not fitting there.\n\nEdit: Vollmann apparently said that the new manager will be announced soon, hope it's true.",

Vollmann sagt: \u201eEs wird kein gro\u00dfer Zeitraum zwischen den beiden Entscheidungen liegen.\u201c\n\nWhich makes me a bit nervous as he talks about decisions and not announcements.",

We got outplayed by Sandhausen and Regensburg at home lmao. I still have no idea how we won against Sandhausen, still feels like the most undeserved win from us that I've seen in a long time. And I have no idea how we started that well against Regensburg just to pretty much not doing anything after the first few minutes. While it is great that we avoided relegation and it is true that we had a shit squad overall (other than players like Pherai and Benkovic of course), it isn't a excuse for the way we played in the last few matches imo.",

With him, we have achieved direct promotion in the first \nfirst season and finally managed to stay in the league. We took an extraordinary amount of time on the decision-making side at the club to analyze intensively what went on at the various sporting levels last season. We have individual facts and came to the conclusion that further development through new impulses and changes is necessary. \nWe wish Michael all the best for his career,\" explains Eintracht's sports managing director Peter Vollmann the decision.\n\n&gt;Michael Schiele had taken over the team in the summer of 2021 after relegation \nfrom the 2nd Bundesliga and achieved immediate promotion. Two weeks ago, the team managed to stay in the league on the last match day.",

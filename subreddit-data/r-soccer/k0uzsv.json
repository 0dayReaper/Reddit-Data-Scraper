He made us feel patriotism. Italians (I know, not everyone, I do not hate italians, MOST ARGENTINIANS ARE 2ND OR 3RD GENERATION ITALIANS) whistle our national anthem? Just pass it to Diego, he will win the match. We went to a moronic war against the English and got our asses kicked? No problem, give the ball to Diego, he will make something and then you will feel happy.\n\nHe was the greatest ever, and a cheater. He was so incredibly smart, and made the dumbest decisions ever. He had everything he needed to be happy, to be the best, yet he always took a wrong turn and ended up badly, but not without having touched greatness moments before.\n\nMaradona was Argentina. Thank you Diego. I'm sorry we as a nation couldn't help you, but I guess we just couldn't, like we can't help ourselves.",

The sad tale of squandered riches and potential, reflected in the mottled greatness of Argentina's most beloved son. There may be other countries like, but not quite like Argentina, but there never has been nor will be someone like Maradona for any other people. There is not enough history or circumstance to permit this. \n\nIt is late, and my addictions are claiming my energy and focus, so I will leave with one last parting word. \n\nThank you, Maradona.

He took me to the stadium to see many matches, from 4th division games, local cups, Sunday league, to Copa Libertadores and Copa Am\u00e9rica events... and he always said that there wouldn't be another one like Maradona.\n\nAs a fan of both, I feel like it's almost poetic that they both died at 60, the same day. \n\nHope they'll meet wherever they are.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver and huuuuuge thanks to everyone that replied to this comment showing their support in these tough times.

You can't have Maradona without his flaws or imagine his career if he hadn't become a drug addict. He was someone who knew how to be relatable, passional and earn the love of supporters and living life to its extremes. There are plenty of amazing docs, books and films to find if anyone wants to understand why Maradona is such a mythological figure and why his legacy is eternal and transcends football more than any other player ever.\n\nArgentina vs. England in 1986, for example, was the ultimate f**k you to England after Argentina lost the war for the Falklands' Island and England was very disliked, hated even, by argentinians. And England is still not a very sympathetic country from a South-American perspective. England is seen as stiff, arrogant, possessing superiority complex and unique smugness.\n\nAnd then we have what Maradona did for Napoli, a region historically discriminated by the rest of Italy and also financially poorer. He is an eternal idol there!",

Thanks to my team being Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a I have seen many of the very best footballers in history. AC Milan during their height (when they played both finals against Liverpool), both Barcelonas that completed the treble, Mourinho's and Zidane's Real Madrid, the rise of Cholismo, I have seen Ronaldinho, Kak\u00e1, Cristiano Ronaldo, Xavi, the whole spanish squad that dominated all the competitions... Many times, many many times on the field, just 20 meters, at best, from me.\n\nBut trust me... I always tried to imagine the feeling of watching Maradona libe. Not Pele, not Di Stefano, Eusebio or any other.\n\nI watched Messi live and always thought that I was glad that at least my children and grand children will get to hear from him directly from me.\n\nAlways loved seeing Banega, Gago, Riquelme and Redondo and trying to think that, in their very best day they might get close to the playstyle that Diego had.\n\nDiego just feels like the creator of the game that I love, a romantic style to it, the ball close to your foot, a player that fights for the ball, that knows how to dribble in short distances...\n\nHe might have made many, and I mean many, mistakes in live, for sure. And I am not trying to say: man, lets forget it. But he was joy to the people and created a culture behind him for a reason.\n\nI just hope that he was happy during his life and want to show my sincere admiration for making me feel like football was more than just a sport just by watching his main matches, tons of clips yes..., and all the documentaries avaliable in the world.\n\nMy number as a player was always 4, but always wanted to be the one wearing his number 10.",

            "comment": "Messi is the main character of football. Born with HGH deficiency with a good chance he might not even play football unless he's given super expensive injections which he couldn't afford. But his talent gave him a contract with Barcelona. Got a red card in his first game for Argentina. But he slowly rose up into one of the best players in the world eventually become *the* best. He carries his team to the World Cup final in 2014 but his team just isn't good enough to support him. So close to the one trophy he values the most but is out of his reach. Heart break. Won everything for his club but people called him a fraud for not winning anything with his national team.\n\nHe decides he can't take it anymore and quits. But changes his decision. Suddenly he learns that the club that gave him everything can't re sign him because of financial regulations. This is the lowest point of his career and the point where the main character is the weakest.\n\nHe finally manages to win Copa America and prove he's still not finished. He's still one of the best. He finds an unlikely new team in PSG. Even though he struggles in the first season, soon he adapts and starts an amazing run of form in the next season. His starts his last ever World Cup but immediately is hit with a setback when they lose to Saudi Arabia. He's subject to jokes and ridicule all around the world. But they come back stronger. And even stronger in the next game. And even stronger still in the one after that. Meanwhile on the other side of the bracket France is running amok amount their opponents and look genuinely unstoppable. France is the final boss.\n\nThey meet in the final. His very last World Cup game. It's all or nothing. His team goes up 2-0 and dominate France for a good 75 minutes. But Mbappe scores a double and pulls France back in the game. Messi tries his all and scores another goal in extra time. But Mbappe isn't going to let it end so easily. He equalizes immediately. The match is going to penalties. Now at this point Messi can't do it himself. He needs his teammates to show up. But unlike 2014 this team is different. They're hungrier. They want to fight. They won't give up so easily.\n\nMessi does his part. He converts his penalty kick. Now all he can do is wait...\n\nHis teammates finally do it. They win it. They beat the final boss. The unstoppable juggernaut, France. They do it for Argentina and for Messi. Messi on his last World Cup game wins the biggest trophy in the world. The one he coveted above all else. He wins *the* trophy.\n\nIf this isn't the story if the main character of football then I don't know what is.",

The main character dominating club football so hard and not winning at international level, one of the biggest and most successful club in recent time going through financial trouble, MC not scoring 50 goals in weaker league and then the recovery arc with Messi finding his form with the new club with a new coach, and going on to the world cup final. Then the final is perfectly written climax scene with ups and downs and then the main character winning it all!",

Yes, I knew he was insanely good at Barcelona, and knew he was out of this world, but I stood my ground and said Ronaldo was better.\n\nBut this World Cup and watching him, what he did to the ball, vision, ball handling, and how he outperformed and outplayed opponents by a single body move is insane. His vision is out of this world, also how deadly he is when he gets the space. The dribble and assist to Alvarez agains Croatia is absurd and insane.\n\nAfter watching him for a month now, I changed my mind. Highly as I respect Ronaldo, Messi is actually out of this world. I wanted Argentina to win agains France, and they did. Now I\u2019m happy because he actually have won everything now.\n\nThe GOAT!",

It maybe controversial but I think Mac is the most underrated midfielder in Europe right now.\n\nI also think people who ask why did Liverpool not go after Bellingham who costs \u00a388M + \u00a325M should consider wages in question! Interesting to read Bellingham's salary will increase over time to \u20ac18M-\u20ac20M gross if all bonuses are fullfilled but currently is below it.\n\nAccording to TheAthletic (Ornstein, Cortegana and more): https://theathletic.com/4590265/2023/06/08/jude-bellingham-real-madrid-transfer-3/\n\n&gt; two Madrid sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their positions, say it will not \u2014 at least for the start of the contract \u2014 reach \u20ac10million-\u20ac12million net per year, and could be a little below.\n\n(Gross/Pre-Tax) So by the time he is 24-25, he will be making \u20ac350K (\u00a3300K) a week, but currently is be at around \u20ac300K (\u00a3250K) a week.\n\nLiverpool would have made him 2nd highest wage earner after Salah! That would destroy the wage structure while Madrid already have a higher structure because of being richest club in the world.",

The fact it knew about the Argentina win when the training data cut off predates that, the use of colloquialisms, putting words over the instrumental part of the song. Whilst individually each of these could be potentially explainable, for instance the guy might have told the ai about the Argentina win and asked it to be incorporated, or specifically asked it to rhyme ya with Argentina- but all the red flags together just leads me to believe its fake.",

I can't believe we're in an era where I can say Brighton had a World cup winner in their squad. \u00a355m is probably a fair price for him too IMO, in today's market if you take out the insane over valuing of players. \n\nLiverpool fans I'm curious, you don't play with a #10, but he's been VERY clear that's where he wants to play and honestly why most Brighton fans won't be concerned about the starting 11 with him gone, he's miles better alongside Caicedo than he is at the #10 where we found him a little disappointing. Do you think you'll make an effort to play him at 10 or do you think he's going to play deeper? I feel like with numerous clubs interested and him only wanting you, you must have plans to let him play in that CAM role.\n\nEdit: why am I getting downvotes and Reddit cares for asking Liverpool fans about where he's going to fit in the 11? I'm genuinely interested and want him to succeed \ud83d\ude06",

Press resistance and work rate to win the ball are key, but helping to break the lines is a secondary trait needed whether that\u2019s through passing (like Thiago), carrying the ball (Ox/Keita but they were rarely fit) or making runs behind (Jones in the last few weeks did this brilliantly).\n\nDon\u2019t worry about downvoted, they\u2019re inevitable sometimes on a sub with many rivals.

What we call pants are really underpants, which of course is something you'd wear under your... pants.  \n\n\nSoccer is another obvious example here, it's a Victorian English abbreviation of \"Association Football\" which was needed at the time to differentiate it from Rugby Football, or *Rugger.*  Rugby Football then split into Rugby Union and Rugby League meaning that Association Football basically got to use the word Football for free and Soccer faded into the background.",

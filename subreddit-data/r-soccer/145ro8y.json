Towards the end of his first tenure, he grew increasingly conservative in his tactics and that was one of the reasons that we parted with him for the first time.\n\nHe took over again after Juventus changed two more coaches every year. However, he is now playing absolutely sleep-inducing ugly counter-attacking pure opportunist football that has no real attacking ideas at all and is torture to watch. Our players can often struggle to string five passes in a row on opponents' half, and it makes you wonder do they even train together.\n\nBy some estimations, Juventus player's total value has depreciated by 34%, the second worst of Serie A teams. Allegri isn't the sole factor but is a big reason of it.\n\nFrom the start of the 22/23 season, fewer and fewer Juventus fans are defending Allegri. And I am also one of the people that changed side.",

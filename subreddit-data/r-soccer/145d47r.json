Obviously we aren't going to give up every match but I can't see us splashing lots of cash on players when we have other priorities (stadium, academy improvements etc).\n\n\n10 mil is a huge fee for us with Morris being our record at 2mil (plus add ons) I am guessing Philips is going to be on an astronomical wage compared to what we offer (top earners will be in the 5-10k bracket).\n\n\nThe club have had a lot of success scouring the lower league for talents and that will probably continue rather than looking to pick up too many PL players (Nakamba being the obvious exception).",

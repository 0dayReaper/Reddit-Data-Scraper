There was also fatigue kicking in regardless for numerous players including Saka, White, Zini, and others. \n\nStill agree that this is on par with signing a marquee player like Rice.",

Seems like his greatest weakness is trouble deviating from a proven starting 11.

Hopefully Arteta gives Nelson and ESR more games next season alongside the addition of 2 more central midfielders can help with that. Hoping Balogun isn't sold either or else Trossard is given more games as striker.",

The guy took things so impersonally he was basically a shield for underperformers for years, and too few of them eventually repaid his faith.\n\nArteta has notoriously frozen out players he didn't think would work or who didn't contribute at the level he expected. Aubameyang, Pepe, Bellerin, Cedric, Lacazette... the list goes on. He has instilled a necessary but ruthless ethic for the first team and dropped anyone who couldn't match it (Tierney, Nuno). If anything it seems as if NOW the attitude is \"this is Arsenal, you should be proud and glad to be part of the project and if not, there is the door\", as you say.",

Just baffling.\nChelsea finished in the bottom half. And it wasn't a fluke. Their metrics are bad. Their team needs a rebuild. And saying that they'll mount a title challenge just because conte did it in a different era is laughable really. We're meant to believe that Chelsea will magically get all their signings right, and poch will develop a system to optimize them in 1 and a half months. I think chelsea will improve btw but to predict a title challenge for them right now isn't based on any facts.\nAnnoying that arsenal have to be good for 2-3 years before people believe in this team but chelsea and man united get all the benefit of the doubt.",

If you look at their reactions and predictions about Arsenal's trajectory so many of them see Arsenal as being still in the late Unai Emery, early Arteta years - and plenty of rival fans too. It's like a mental block. Very few saw Arsenal reaching top 4 being on the cards this season - BBC article had 8 pundits out of 23 pundits predicting 4th (for added context, two of those pundits have an Arsenal bias and a 3rd probably a slight bias). \n\nNo pundits predicted 3rd (18/23 predicted Spurs would get 3rd btw). The predictions for next season will be interesting. \n\nCompare that to people who actually know what's going on in the game like opposition players and managers -they were all seeing it last season, this season was not as much of a surprise for them.",

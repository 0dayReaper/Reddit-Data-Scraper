Champo gives such a huge financial boost, and a winning run, with all their games getting coverage as well, is enough to line their pockets and might not lead to them getting any overly dodgy sponsorships, even if their wage bill explodes with all the champions league winning increases to their contracts",

His potential hasn\u2019t stalled , he just plays under the system manager Pep Guardiola and plays a role that requires great technical ability &amp; reading of the game to fulfil.      \nBut yeah, he\u2019s outgrown the youngster label now .. so there are no excuses anymore.",

City will play in 7 competitions next year, the player with the most games this year was Bruno Fernandes playing almost 70 games, and thats without ManU having a deep CL run.\n\nPoint is, City got lucky that it was more or less spared of major injuries this season. But you cant count on that. If Dias goes down, City is in big trouble - adding Gvardiol would at least soften the blow a bit.\n\nRight now they have Alvarez for the robot, Foden (Palmer) for KDB, Mahrez for Silva and Walker for Akanji and thats about it, the others like Phillips, Perrone, Gomez or Lewis are wildcards. So City adding a quality CB/LB in Gvardiol, a CM for Gundogan (Kovacic) and a LW for Grealish will likely be the priority. Maybe another CB or LB, depending on where Pep sees Gvardiol.",

The stacking of oil money and it was already said to be getting out of hand (no reprocussions for current fraud charges, the fuck?)\n\nAnd we all said they will slowly delay because city still brings in money, and the argument is \u201cdulled\u201d the longer things aren\u2019t addressed, a la, City are about to sign the best potential defender in the world after lying and spending so much. This is the reason, this is why it\u2019s bad- the Halaands and Gvardiol go there after years of lying, none of it\u2019s real and the sport dies. \n\nNo one who follows football doesn\u2019t understand depth or a strong bench haha, the mental gymnastics is wild, there\u2019s no excuses for this stuff to be happening. There are no more fuck off prices, yeah every team has to spend to win- this is insanity now. If there was ever a sign nothings going to happen, it\u2019s this\n\nThe centurions basically get to add a generation striker and generational defender without a blink of an issue haha, all for fake numbers. Anyone comparing them to a Real of Barca or ManU just doesn\u2019t want to accept it, it\u2019s a club on a balloon of fraudulence.",

The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a \"no/minor developments\" report.   \n\nIf there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment. Please help us reporting unnecessary threads for being duplicates. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

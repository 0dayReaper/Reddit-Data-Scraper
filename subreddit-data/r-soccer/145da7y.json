Italiano football is scoring one more that the opponent, but if the striker can't finish you can't do that. Our defenders (outside of Igor late this season for whatever reason) aren't that bad. It's just that with an high line a single mistake is going to be punished, our defenders are at the top in Serie A in defensive tackles won and opponent chances stopped.",

Neither goal against inter was because of high line, just very very mediocre defense. Italianos football is also about high press, winning possession right after losing it and being able to track down through balls when high press is breached. That last one is especially something our defenders struggle with. They are way too error prone for that.",

Also Italiano's whole style is about high press and high line. If you expect him to start coaching our team to park the bus for 89 minutes like Mourinho does for example, its not going to happen. Instead Prade needs to find a CB that complements Milenkovic and who can execute a high line without making a catastrophic error at every turn like LMQ and especially Igor does.",

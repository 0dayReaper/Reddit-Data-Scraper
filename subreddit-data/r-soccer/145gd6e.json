They see a manager that has underperformed at his last few clubs. And that's not me saying he is a bad coach per definition, it's just that it would be somewhat reasonable if that makes him less appealing to Mislintat.\n\nThe one thing I will say though is that, from what I've read online, Knutsen his way of playing also gets described as 'kamikaze' football. So I'm not sure if that plays a massive role in the decision to not appoint Bosz. Might just be that they see more potential in Knutsen.",

If Mislintat has his doubts about Bosz then I would much rather have him go with a \"risky\" coach that he does have full faith in. An immediate lack of faith in the project would be setting us up for failure even more. \n\nAlso mere speculation from my side, but Mislintat was clear about the fact that he wants to build a team and then find a coach that is capable of managing the team he built. Bosz seems like the type of coach who really wants input himself so it wouldn't surprise me if that was part of the issue.",

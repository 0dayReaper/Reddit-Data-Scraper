There is no name for a syndrome of someone staying with an abusive partner, because that's just normal human behavior. Someone you love slowly starts abusing you, and it slowly gets worse and worse, and you justify it to yourself each step of the way. Like a frog boil. It's called the cycle of abuse, and it causes people to get back together with abusive partners thinking it will be different.",

It's important to point out imo, because so many people still trot out the 'why don't they just leave' rhetoric because fundamentally a lot of society really do not understand abusive relationships (even many people who have experienced them to some degree).\n\nBy the time something appears to be an abusive relationship...that just walk away option is already gone, you've already justified staying enough times (and often been blamed by the partner, to be made into the guilty party).",

He was considered one of the best young forwards in the world.\n\nUnited don't want to take a 50m+ loss, so they're trying their best to keep his value up so he can either play for them again or so they can sell him.\n\nPersonally, I 100% expect him to play for Manchester United next season.",

I don't think Man U would ever be able to reintroduce him into their team at this point *and* they can't just terminate his contract either without paying him full sum + god knows how much extra. As a club, in a purely business sense, they're at an impasse.\n\nThat said, they should just terminate his contract and be done with it - they have the money.",

Yes there\u2019s no legal reason to terminate his contract, but what about paying him the remainder in full? Is that not legal given it\u2019s the same wage they agreed to initially? Also, is Greenwood going to sue them if they simply pay him what\u2019s left and tear up the contract, and what could he even sue for? You paid me my contract but didn\u2019t let me work long enough?\n\nI totally get there\u2019s no easy clause that saves United money, but this really seems like they just don\u2019t want to pay up and are trying to find a way to get rid of him without just paying out his contract. Surely this has happened in the UK where one party wants to end a contract prematurely, but with the fully agreed upon wage being paid out. Is that illegal if one party doesn\u2019t agree?",

Italy, Spain and Turkey are thought to be the three likeliest options.\n\n\nUnited are understood to have stepped up their probe into Greenwood \u2013 who has two years remaining on his \u00a375,000-a-week contract - following the conclusion of their campaign on Saturday. \n\nThey could decide to release the player should they find he brought the club into disrepute, or they could complete the review and send him overseas to allow themselves a further period of reflection. \n\nManchester United are exploring the option of sending Mason Greenwood on loan for the entirety of next season\n\nManchester United are exploring the option of sending Mason Greenwood on loan for the entirety of next season\nMan United boss Erik ten Hag (pictured) has rarely given updates on the club's position on Greenwood\n\nMan United boss Erik ten Hag (pictured) has rarely given updates on the club's position on Greenwood\nGreenwood is currently suspended from all Man United duties pending the outcome of an internal investigation\n\nGreenwood is currently suspended from all Man United duties pending the outcome of an internal investigation\n\nSuch a prospect would also allow them to gauge public reaction along with Greenwood\u2019s mental health and performance levels. They could also send him to Europe where he would secure playing time while the investigation continues.\n\n\nGreenwood, who has an England cap, was suspended by United when the allegations were first made in January of last year and remains out of the picture.\n\nThe likelihood of the Bradford-born academy product heading to another Premier League club is remote.\n\nAnd while United have had offers from Turkey, Greenwood may prefer to play at a higher level. As such, a move to Italy or Spain could be on the cards. \n\nHowever, the optics of bringing Greenwood onboard may pose a problem for some ownership groups. Those with knowledge of the situation say a move to an American-owned club, such as AC Milan, might prove difficult.\n\nThere would also have to be an agreement over salary. Greenwood has been on full pay throughout the process.\n\nThe situation is a complex one. United are wary of the views of the dressing rooms of both their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. It is also further complicated by the ongoing takeover process at Old Trafford. \n\nUnited have effectively been for sale since November and while the process has dragged on, a conclusion \u2013 with Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and British petrochemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe both in the hunt \u2013 is likely over the coming days.\n\n\nThe situation regarding Greenwood's future at Old Trafford is a complex one due to views of the dressing rooms of both their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams and the ongoing takeover\n\n\nThe situation regarding Greenwood's future at Old Trafford is a complex one due to views of the dressing rooms of both their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams and the ongoing takeover\nThe likelihood of the United academy product heading to another Premier League club is remote\n\n\nThe likelihood of the United academy product heading to another Premier League club is remote\nGreenwood has been spoken to by United as part of their investigation. Police opened their probe after audio was released on social media last January. A video \u2013 which appeared to show a woman with multiple injuries and a blooded face \u2013 was also posted.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges in February, citing the withdrawal of key witnesses and \u2018new material\u2019 which \u2018meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction\u2019.\n\nIn a recent interview manager Erik ten Hag said Greenwood, who has scored 36 goals in 130 games for United, had \u2018showed in the past he is capable of doing that\u2019 when asked if he needed another striker to take the weight off Marcus Rashford\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\nThe Dutchman added: \u2018What we need besides Marcus Rashford is one extra player with scoring abilities whether it\u2019s coming out of our own squad or we have to sign one. \u2019United declined to comment.",

Here are some facts on what is a complex issue: \n\n* Whatever you think about Greenwood, you have less information than the Police who DECLINED to prosecute what you all think is a cut and dry case. \n* New Information came to light (in addition to key witnesses dropping out) that led to the Police declining to prosecute the case\n* You don't know that new information.\n* Whatever you think about Greenwood, he is LEGALLY innocent. \n* Baseless speculations as to why Greenwood and the girl in question got married are just that, baseless. You don't know anything about these people. Whether you think she is only there for money, pressure from dad, stockholm syndrome, being in an abusive vortex where she loses her free will, all this is baseless.\n* Greenwood has never given an explanation of the incident\n* Greenwood has always maintained his innocence.\n\nEverything stated above is a fact. Now given he was Utd's biggest asset talent wise prior to his arrest, he is 21, married to the lady in question and has a kid, does he deserve at least a chance to explain himself, own the situation to whatever level he can and rehabilitate himself and his mental health. Or does the mob want him never to play football gain at Utd because they have never seen kids make monumental mistakes in life and change their ways (whatever you believe about Greenwood). \n\nNow the charges against Greenwood were very serious so I do understand the gravity of the feelings against him. But as the charges were dropped, he does deserve a fresh start. He can only do so by giving an explanation of the clip, apologizing publically, taking efforts to help himself (therapy) and focusing fully on football (avoiding any other issues).",

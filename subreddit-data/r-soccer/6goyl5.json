It's much more fun to be a part of a group of friends supporting a club than just being alone with your niche club. So find some bars or groups in San Diego that watch the games together and check if you like their atmosphere.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with picking a winning club. The only wrong thing is changing clubs when they stop winning. ",

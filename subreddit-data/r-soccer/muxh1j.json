They could just continue on with another 'Woodward' running things and take their yearly dividends. They could get ugly and deprive us of wealth to hurt the club and strip us of assets until they truly bleed us to a point where they can sell. I don't know. This could get ugly. \n\nFWIW I think the 2nd option is most likely, but who knows. Maybe the Glazers had this ESL plan as the end goal and now what?",

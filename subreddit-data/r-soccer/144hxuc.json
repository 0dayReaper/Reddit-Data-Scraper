The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a \"no/minor developments\" report.   \n\nIf there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment. Please help us reporting unnecessary threads for being duplicates. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That's the reverse of common sense. I think very highly of Rice, and he's irreplaceable in my eyes. \n\nThat said, I think that Paqueta has provided a fresh progression option in the middle this year which should lessen the sting of losing Rice's forward passes and carries. It's not going to be a good loss, but in this instance with Paqueta (and to some extent Downes), Hammers have planned the midfield well for the future. \n\nNow if only you could get your striker position sorted...",

I use the scare quotes because People see the classic 3 man midfield and assume traditional 6-8-10 roles, but they really do so much overlapping to the point where it\u2019s almost just 3 mids.\n\nHowever, that being said, he\u2019s genuinely a top 3 presser in the league and his ability to create turnovers in opposition 3rds was second only to Casemiro by quite some distance (he was closer to 1 than 3 was to him.) he also has a bit of an underrated long shot on him. His off-ball positioning sense is so good though that it comes through in niche ways like being there for rebounds and set piece headers etc",

He always demonstrated positional intelligence so it never really surprised me that his pressing would instantly transition well to the Prem. That quote specifically is wrong, you're only using one single year of his career there when his context can very well vary depending on the team's system.\n\nIn the end his ball playing is nowhere terrible as you're claiming but a player like him that tends to go scorched earth everywhere on the pitch definitely has to be paired with a ball playing midfielder (during his most recent stint here, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio and then Matheus Nunes). Only difference is that he always played behind them, sitting deeper, while the B2B just ran around connecting stuff around him if needed.",

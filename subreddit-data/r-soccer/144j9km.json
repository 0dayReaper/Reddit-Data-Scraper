Maybe Zidedine Zidane",

Surprisingly, I think Argentina is the next smallest WC champion in population today (we are sort of even with Spain I think right now), obviously the gap is much smaller than Uruguay's, buy you made me realiza that.\n\nAnyway, there's maaaybe a tiny argument you could make for Croatia? Since they have a similar population, but they've been a FIFA country for only ~30 years and got two 3rd places and a 2nd place in 7 tournaments. You had the chance to qualify and play in all of them. \n\nBut I still think that yeah, it's you easily.",

He has the beard, he has the scowl, he's a monster defensively and works so well with the rest of his backline. Facu is another absolute warrior. He may have been born in Spain, but he's more Uruguayan than bitter mate\n\nI'm most excited about Maturro, though. He has qualities of a DM, he can play as a CB, he can play as a LB, and can both attack and defend from there. Aside from that, he's just got such a passionate way of playing. He's such a perfect iteration of what a modern Uruguay should be, as this entire team is, from Broli and his staff, to every player that's been a part of this process, whether they're here right now or not.\n\n\nAdd all of that to the spine of players we currently have, who are among the European elite, and playing critical roles for their clubs (although Araujo could stand to give more of a shit about us), and Bielsa's notorious ability to raise the floor for a NT, and I'm incredibly excited about the future. Bielsa probably isn't the man to take us to where we ultimately want to be, but he'll absolutely push us along and set a good foundation for a future in which Broli or Pezzolano probably take over. Those are two incredible coaches, and Broli absolutely exudes passion and intelligence. He's a rare breed of coach that can motivate, but can also outthink. \n\n\nWith the World Cup potentially coming here in 2030, I can't help but dream, I can't help but feel as though we're on the cusp of something grand. First, let's see how we do on Sunday, though\n\n\nAlso sorry to ramble on so long, I'm just so excited by our prospects for the future",

The CB spot will be very competitive, Gimenez will hold it down maybe until the World Cup but I don't see him starting in 2026.\n\nAraujo will be on the RB for awhile as well, the RB group of Varela, Pumita, Zorro Suarez and Gio Gonzales have not impressed.\n\nThe GK spot as well is bright due to Rochet, Isreal and Melee all competing for the spot. The ideal middle would be Ugarte, Bentancur Valverde and I think that is where we stop being Elite.\n\nNunez has not stepped up yet to the level we are used to, and the wingers are young and do not play for important clubs. Our attack is what has me still with my feet on the ground.",

Ponte is coming along nicely, Chagas seems to be a jack of all trades, and I still have some faith in guys like Gio Gonzalez. Our CB pairing should probably be Josema+Boselli, with Olivera or Maturro on the left, and the other on the bench with Coates, Facu Gonzalez, Santi Bueno, etc. Obviously the GK spot is great. De Arruabarrena, Randall, Mele, Rochet, Israel, Mele. They'll generate an insane amount of competition, I'm sure. And our midfield is also great, I agree. Not only those 3, but guys like GDA, DLC, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Leo Fern\u00e1ndez, Felipe Carballo, and others who provide a good amount of depth.\n\n\nBut I'm not too worried about our attack. Darwin is young still, much like the rest of our attack. \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez is slowly carving out a place for himself in Madrid, Luciano shows some tremendous promise, Duarte seems to be a more intelligent Darwin, Borbas is doing great for RB Bragantino, Arezo is experiencing a resurgence here, Andr\u00e9s Ferrarri, while we may not have seen too much of him, is already bound for Europe. Players like Facu Torres, Facu Pellistri, and Terans look good in the time they do get to play against opposition of note. Hell, Valverde can even do a job on the wing, and free the midfield up for a more traditional 10 like GDA or Franco Gonzalez. We could also play Araujo as a CB, and have Maturro as RB to Valverde's RW role. That duo would get up and down the wing in a matter of seconds. Maturro has shown the ability to play centrally and out wide both in defense and higher up the pitch. There's no reason as to why he wouldn't be able to put in at least a decent shift as an inverted fullback of sorts. \n\n\nWe have ways to plug the gaps, and we have an incredible amount of depth. Perhaps most importantly, we have a group that is going to generate a lot of competition, which will make it so that no spot is safe, and no complacency sets in, like it did with guys like Godin and C\u00e1ceres",

I could see him moving Araujo to CB and GDA to the midfield, as well as putting a goalkeeper who's better with his feet\n\n\nSomething like\n\n\n                                   Randall Rodriguez \n          Maturro Ronald Araujo Josema Mathias Olivera\n                             Bentancur Manuel Ugarte\n                                Giorgian De Arrascaeta \n                   Valverde- Darwin Nu\u00f1ez- ???\n\n\nI think the base of a 4-3-3 system is probably correct, except he'll probably want a hardworking 10 who can score and assist. That was his bread and butter at Leeds. I reckon Maturro's ability to get up, and Valverde's ability to get down the pitch will synchronize very well down the right flank. Ugarte and Bentancur can probably take turns playing that Kalvin Phillips role, with someone like Fabricio Diaz also being a potential candidate for that role.\n\nMy only worry is the left wing. I've half a mind to put Pellistri on there just for his work rate, but Bielsa would probably want an out and out left winger who can cover for Olivera and vice versa. Maybe Darwin plays on the left, and we get someone like \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez or Anderson Duarte in. Strikers with good movement, or who are fast or tall enough to be in good positions at good times.",

That's pretty much what happened to the US in the first half of the QFs, lots of possession but no chances created, ended up 1-0 and it could've easily been 3-0 if our players had been more clinical with the finishing.",

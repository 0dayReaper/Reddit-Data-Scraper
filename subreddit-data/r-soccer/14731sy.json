That's how equal opportunities looks like. Just imagine a jewish player in the palestinian national team. Can't imagine? Yeah figured so. The israeli audience, at least most of it, appreciates anan, and every singe arab on the team and in general. You don't see even close to this level of tolerence in the other side. Now don't get me wrong, i criticise israel in many ways, as a left-leaning person, but accusing israel of \"aparthide\" and stuff like that is a total bs propaganda.

If you need urgent medical treatment in Israel, the West Bank or overseas \u2013 we\u2019re on your tail.

In a training course we actually learned and memorized the different Arabic words for homosexual.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"That is quite ridiculous, which I can say from my experience as a human rights lawyer. There are many cases of LGBT people from the Palestinian territories who get to Israel and try to get refuge after the Shin Bet blackmailed them, and they get to the point when they are known to Palestinian society as homosexuals or traitors, and \\[Palestinians\\] presume they\u2019re informers. This phenomenon was known for a long time, but it was thought to be marginal. What these soldiers allow us to say is that it\u2019s a general thing \u2026 a general policy. \\[Unit 8200\\]  gathers information on \\[Palestinian\\] homosexuals and uses it to turn them against family members or friends.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In Yedioth, Israel\u2019s leading print journalist, Nahum Barnea, fully defended the truthfulness (though not the judgment) of the dissidents:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"One would have expected the military to respond to this claim \\[of spying on innocent Palestinians to blackmail them into collaborating\\] with a commitment to examine it and correct any failings. Instead we got a wholesale denial \u2013 a denial that brought a cynical grin to the face of everyone who is familiar with the reality of the \\[intelligence-gathering\\] system. \u2026The occupation corrupts, say the refuseniks of 8200, and they\u2019re telling the truth. In the best case, the information they pick up prevents terror; in many other cases it serves the malice, arbitrariness and stupidity of the occupation, or it provides a presentable wrapping for some deceitful government policy.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To balance out Noa Levy on the radio program, I asked Eitan Meirsdorf, a reserve Israeli soldier and head of the far-right Im Tirtzu organization at Bar-Ilan University, what he thought of Unit 8200 spying on Palestinian innocents for the purpose of blackmail. Meirsdorf, at least, was candid enough to say what the Israeli establishment is not: that he has no problem with it:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"This is not specific to Israel \u2013 every single intelligence unit in the world does it. \\[Unit 8200\\] is trying to catch terrorists, and at the end of the day, as an Israeli citizen, if there\u2019s a chance that a terrorist is going to blow up my house, my family, then yeah, I would try to do everything I could to stop them. For them to pass up a chance to catch a terrorist and then that terrorist kills Israelis \u2013 that doesn\u2019t seem very moral to me.\"\n\n[https://www.972mag.com/against-spy-revelations-israel-doth-protest-too-much/](https://www.972mag.com/against-spy-revelations-israel-doth-protest-too-much/)  \n\n\n[https://www.vice.com/en/article/av8b5j/gay-palestinians-are-being-blackmailed-into-working-as-informants](https://www.vice.com/en/article/av8b5j/gay-palestinians-are-being-blackmailed-into-working-as-informants)  \n\n\nZuhair Al Ghaleeth, a 23-year-old gay Palestinian was blackmailed by Israelis (had a video of him with his partner) to give up intel about Palestinian militants: [https://twitter.com/FalahSaab/status/1644968073210867712](https://twitter.com/FalahSaab/status/1644968073210867712)  \n\n\nI don't think \"your honour, the ethnically cleansed were homophobic\" is a good defense for settler colonialism and this pinkwashing falls apart when you look at how Israelis treat LGBT Palestinians.",

The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a \"no/minor developments\" report.   \n\nIf there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment.

Bar\u00e7a would have to sell for near 160m(!!!) euros worth to be able to register him, or raise similar amounts of money in some other way.

That is to say, each year, one in six deaths in this age group is a suicide.\" Compare this to some stats I found about the US:\"Suicides make up 1.5 of every 100 deaths\".\n\nTo clarify, I still believe in free mental health support being available to all despite these figures - It's just something i found interesting/odd.

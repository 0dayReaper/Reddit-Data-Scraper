Lens has zero reasons to sell him if not for an overpay, they should be able to convince him to stay if it's to a club like that, and that's not usually how Brighton do things. \n\nConsidering the rumored price for Disasi (aka allegedly 40 to 50M), there would be no reasons for Lens to sell for less than that for a much better player. Would Brighton be willing to pay that much ?",

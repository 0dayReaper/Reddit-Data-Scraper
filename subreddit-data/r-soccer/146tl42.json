He should have left Lyon 2-3 seasons ago if it wasn't for his brother and his bad decisions. He seemed really unmotivated the past couple years and hopefully this move will help find himself again. He also just switched playing for Algeria instead of France too so should see quite bit more game time as Deschamps clearly didn't see him playing much with us. There's a good player in there somewhere.",

It's a good thing, the issue of gambling addiction is clearly something that needs to be addressed and talked about more. It's just that in Germany I barely ever hear anyone talk about sports gambling in such a critical manner. Not fans and not media people either. Like alcohol, it's something that's completely normalised here.",

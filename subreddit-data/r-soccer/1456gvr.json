Last year AFA decided to relegate 1 extra team per year until we eventually go back down to 22, though inevitably something will happen to bring the number up again.",

Mancini has gone on record saying that he was paid under the table via offshore accounts. I'm sure they stopped that. Numerous fake sponsorship deals. Somehow City has the most revenue in the world. \n\nNewcastle takeover was encouraged by the British government as it will lead to \u00a324b towards the economy over a 10 year period - no conflict of interest to \"encourage\" them to do well when the government is telling them to make it happen. \n\nIt's a failure of the media and the leagues though. The press have the power to really put the real pressure on these clubs but instead they gloat how City have financially doped to a potential treble, how Roman was \"a great custodian\" and how Newcastle's rise was a fairy tale. \n\nNah, it's all rotten to the core but let's stay distracted with the tribalism and get distracted by the poor officiating every week.",

            "comment": "Summary: \n\n&gt;Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has played a significant role in the discussions surrounding the potential purchase of Manchester United by a group led by Qatari royal Sheikh Jassim. The Glazer family, the majority owners of United, put the club up for sale in November. The bidding contest narrowed down to Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation and British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n&gt;**Initially, Sheikh Jassim's bid team sought advice from Al-Khelaifi on United's valuation, as the Glazers indicated a desired price of $8 billion. However, the Glazers reached out to Al-Khelaifi in an attempt to persuade Sheikh Jassim to increase his bid. Acting in an advisory capacity, Al-Khelaifi has met with the Glazers and Raine Group, the American bank overseeing the sale, to discuss the proposed takeover.**\n\n&gt;Sheikh Jassim's group submitted what they described as their final bid, approximately \u00a35 billion, for the entire club, including shares held by minority shareholders. This bid aims to take United back into private ownership, removing the need for public financial reporting. Ratcliffe's bid values the club slightly higher but proposes a staged takeover, potentially leaving the Glazer siblings as minority shareholders initially.\n\n&gt;Concerns have arisen about the involvement of Al-Khelaifi, given his influential positions in the beIN Media Group, the European Club Association, and Qatar Sports Investments. Some Premier League clubs worry about potential state ownership if United were to be acquired by Sheikh Jassim. However, representatives deny any state involvement, emphasizing Al-Khelaifi's advisory role.\n\n&gt;While Premier League rules allow for Al-Khelaifi, QSI, or QIA ownership of United, UEFA has a regulation prohibiting two clubs under the same control from competing in the same tournament. If common ownership were established, PSG and United could not participate in the Champions League simultaneously. UEFA's stance on multi-club ownership is being questioned.\n\n&gt;Regulatory concerns make some observers speculate that Ratcliffe's bid may face fewer obstacles. Ratcliffe already owns OGC Nice in France, which has participated in European competitions, and may need to sell or reduce his stake if his bid for United succeeds.\n\n&gt;All parties involved in the takeover talks, including the Glazers, are aware of these concerns. Neither Al-Khelaifi, the Glazers, Raine, nor Sheikh Jassim provided comments on the matter.",

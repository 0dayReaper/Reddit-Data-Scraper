City used to overpay 15 years ago, but now they've learned and if they feel they're getting rinsed they just pull out, like with Harry Kane. \n\nIMO knowing that Barcelona was sitting on 222M in cold hard cash definitely made every club raise the price of their wingers by 50% because they knew that Barcelona was desperate to find a replacement.",

A year later thanks to a growing worldwide recognition through kits sales and social media, they had a deal with Jordan, making them the only football club to feature the jumpman in their unforms. Even though Neymar didn't help the team to win any trophy outside France, PSG rose to a merchandise club that can be equal to Manchester United, Bayern and Real Madrid when it comes to selling their name. Even non football fans are attracted to PSG. And that's thanks to Neymar and later Mbappe.",

By the time Neymar was officially moved in August, Real Madrid had dropped out of signing Mbapp\u00e9 that summer as he couldn\u2019t be guaranteed a spot with BBC still there.\n\nWas it a question of them not believing in what he would turn out to be at that point or they just thought Dembele was the better player? He would have been perfect for them. 3 failed 100+ mil transfers is insane",

They went with Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 who was being rated at a similar level to Mbapp\u00e9 at the time. Little did we know how that would turn out. Vamos Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 \ud83d\ude91",

Always in their top 5 performing players every season bar the 1 he was injured for 80% of it (The one where he returned in January, played a month, got injured for another 9 and led to the Braithwaite signing). He also seems pretty loyal and passionate for Barcelona, he cut his salary demands on his contract renewal to help with the wage cap and the way he talks to the media now after maturing shows a lot of class - he is looks to be a good influence and role model for the squad now\nIf he stays at this level and plays for 5/6/7 more years the fee would be perfectly justified.",

Like you can almost argue that Pogba isn't even in the bottom half, despite all the nonsense that happened there. That's how terrible this list is. At least Pogba has his 2017/18 season. Players like Coutinho have literally nothing. \n\nSo yeah, Ronaldo's transfer is easily among the more successful ones. I mean, compare him to Neymar. Neymar cost twice as much. He spend twice as long at PSG than Ronaldo did at Juve. And he scored one more league goal for PSG than Ronaldo did for Juve.",

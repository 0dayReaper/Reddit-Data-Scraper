He has had a decent start and will only get better.",

Darwin was expensive, sure, but haaland would have been closer to mbappe than Darwin and the pundits were acting like they were expected to be similar quality. Haaland is a much more finished product, as young as he also is.\n\nNot to say Nunez has lived up to his fee, but he has been promising, especially if you compare him to Antony rather than haaland",

[His first official start as LB came a couple games later in the Gold Cup 7-0 demolition against Cuba.](https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/539226) I vividly recall how Herdman making that move made a lot of noise and had a lot of people questioning it at the time. If Davies is now known primarily as a LB the switch obviously has paid off for both club/country.",

The game was originally only going to use the lower 2 levels of seating (commonly done for most of the season), but adding 25,000+ seats starting at $125 each would be the revenue generating equivalent of hosting another match.",

And since Atlanta plays Miami at home at least once per season, this will probably become an annual occurrence.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve been to mid-week matches this season where the mission was to pay as little as we can to get in the building. Last week we bought 10 minutes before kickoff and got in for under $10 (fees included) for 200 level seats. That\u2019s not the norm though.",

Plus all games this year pretty much start at 7:30 PM local time, so it\u2019s usually cooled down a little by kickoff. And it\u2019s soccer, both teams use one side line, they\u2019d use the sideline the dolphins usually use. But I\u2019d imagine the hold up is that they have concerts and other events that have the stadium booked out. Sure they would do some games there at some point if they can work out an agreement.",

Too good of an opportunity to pass up. But seems like it would be hard to permanently make it their home field",

Even College football teams have bigger stadiums, the Big House where the University of Michigan plays American football and the Shoe (the horseshoe) where The Ohio State University plays are bigger, but those sizes of stadiums wouldn't work for the University of Miami (the U, their logo is just a green and orange U) because their fan base isn't as big either.",

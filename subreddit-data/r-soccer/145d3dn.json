So last 80 years there have been only 7, that averages to about one every 12 years. Of this 7, 4 were less than 31 when they debutted. Of the remaining 3, one was Cannavaro, that had just won wc and ballon d'or but was in a club going to play in second division, so quite an exceptional case. And we are left then with Puskas, that's one of the greatest and end up paying for other 7 years or so, and Ricardo Carvalho, that I guess was bought on Mourinho request? So yeah, basically last 80 years, Real Madrid has bought only Carvalho more than 31 and not exceptional. That's quite something tbh.",

I didn't believe it at first, but I checked and you are right.\n\n7 players are Pjanic, Alves, Luuk, Aguero, Auba, Alonso, Lewy\n\nOne could argue that most of them are not really bad signings.\n\nPjanic was clearly a shady deal to balance the finances. Aguero was very unlucky with his heart problems. Alonso is an okay backup given that he was a free signing as well.\n\nOthers have been quite good tbh. Auba was excellent since we sold him after he performed quite well with us after joining us for a free transfer. Luuk was on loan and did his part. Alves had had the lowest possible wages allowed so he didn't cost much at all. Lewy is so far so good.",

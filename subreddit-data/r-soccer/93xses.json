He was once talking in an interview about how the team was unsure about themselves after a streak of losses and needs to keep their head up, and then the interviewer asked him, if he was also unconfident in himself. Kahn just looks at him with complete bewilderment: \"Me? No.\" His tone just indicated that he didn't even understand the question, he was Kahn the Titan (that rhymes in German) and he was never not confident. Just the fucking funniest thing I've ever seen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QPxAkNujcs",

I ended up at  keeper for the rest of the season and that was the only game we won all year, but that was still a great memory to look  back on. \n\n*edit for clarity",

I was just like I\u2019m gonna keep that shit out the fuckin goal let\u2019s go bitches.\n\nSo my team made it to the final and I was on fire. I was a chubby little monster between the posts. 4 clean sheets and I even saved a penalty. I was on top of the world... if only I had known.\n\nSo I think most of us are familiar with the rules regarding passing back to the keeper? Well middle school me absolutely was not well versed in these finer details. I was too busy side-hugging thots. So in approximately the 85\u2019 of the final, our best player is tracking back to our own end and he\u2019s forced to pass it to me. As it\u2019s rolling to me, I stoop down to pick it up and he belts out for me to stop, knowing if would give them an indirect free kick. So I do stop.\n\nAnd I let the ball roll through my legs\n\nWe lost 1-0\n\nI\u2019ve played friendly games of soccer plenty of times since then, and more than once I\u2019ve been asked to be the goalie. Never again.\n\nNever. Again.",

Not to laugh, just to remind myself that even pros make amateur-like fuck-ups sometimes.\n\nMy worst goalkeeper mistake is definitely something along the lines though. Back-pass, go to kick it straight away as I see an opposition player approaching, proceeds to kick the air instead of the ball, ball rolls into the net. This one was 10+ years ago and it still pains to write.\n\n[Remember Sven Ulreich?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5h1sIAvQqU&amp;t=21s)",

Sometimes I'll hit a rocket that hits them straight in the chest and they just get back up haha. \n\nAnother cool thing is teaching them how to dive. The look on their face when they fully extend for the first time is really cool. \n\nAlso, one time a parent came up to me and said that his shy son yelled for the first time in a game to claim the ball, something I kept encouraging him to do in practice. Makes you feel proud as a coach. He was the hardest worker and the most improved. By the end of training, he was fully diving in one direction, getting up and saving a follow up shot in the other direction",

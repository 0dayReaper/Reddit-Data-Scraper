One was a defensive mid and the other was a number 10 type of player. The number 10 was by far the best player I had ever played with or against, and would average like 2 goals a game for the whole season. The mid was okay, consistent but nothing special or flashy.\n\nWell, the DM was the one who ended up professional, playing in the A League for ten years. The 10? Furthest he got was playing for Basingstoke Town FC in division 8 of the pyramid. I don't know whether it was just lack of drive or discipline or whether he just peaked really early, but my point is you can never tell exactly what's going to happen.",

He came round and spent at least 15 minutes with every kid, not just talking to them out of some sort of press deal, no one was there. Just because he was genuinely interested in their lives. There was a kid with severe spinal deformaties and he literally took his shirt off and signed it for him. I'll always think of him as a legend because of how he made every one of those children feel.",

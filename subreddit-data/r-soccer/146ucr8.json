    "postText": "I\u2019ve been grieving since yesterday, today I\u2019ve found this article which tries to analyze the more technical aspect of the game. I know this is not a kind of popular content in this subreddit, but hopefully somebody else can enjoy this article, since I saw a couple of users disappointed at the whole \u201cFootball has lost\u201d narrative of the last couple of hours.\n\n[Original here](https://www.ultimouomo.com/inter-manchester-city-finale-champions-league-analisi-tattica-inzaghi-guardiola/), DeepL translation below.\n\n**Manchester City-Inter, victory of the fittest**\n\n*Despite a misguided approach, Guardiola's team wins the Champions League.*\n\nWe forget too often and too easily that athletes are men and as such feel emotions. That they are not defined solely by their technical abilities and are not pawns that a coach moves at will to win a chess game with the opposing coach. The emotional aspect is probably the most unfathomable of the infinite factors that influence a sports performance. And while it is sometimes abused in invoking explanations pertaining to the emotional sphere-motivation, grit, determination, even the \"DNA of a club\"-to lazily describe a team's performance, its very unmeasurable dimension sometimes causes it to slip into the background compared to the technical, tactical and athletic aspects of a match.\n \nIt is minute 19 of the Champions League final. The ball is at the feet of Rodri in the middle of the field, who is not too pressured by the Inter players lined up in their own half to defend their own area. Rodri chooses to play a horizontal pass to Bernardo Silva, who is stationary at the same height as his partner on the right sideline. The pass is slow and predictable and is read to perfection by Di Marco, who anticipates Bernardo Silva and starts a restart that ends with a shot from outside the box by Brozovic. The seemingly insignificant action is instead paradigmatic of City's game. Rodri's mistake is not so much that the pass is predictable.\n\nIn the best moments, the passes and movements of Guardiola's men appear so exact that they draw the best of the infinite possibilities of developing a maneuver, so adherent to their coach's principles of play that they skirt the line between beauty and predictability. Rodri's mistake is surprising for the intention of the pass, for the choice made among the many possible ones. There would have been no benefit, either immediate or future for City's maneuver even if the pass had come between Bernardo Silva's feet. Rodri's pass was not part of a larger design, not aimed at generating advantages for his team. Quite simply, the City halfback had gotten the ball out of his feet, in a trivial and sloppy manner. If the transmission of the ball is a form of communication between players, Rodri's pass amounted to blasphemy in Guardiola's vocabulary. An obvious sign from the tension that gripped City's players in the Champions League final against Inter Milan.\n \n[[1]](https://i.imgur.com/XV1hyht.jpg) *Rodri has three more complex but possible passing lines that would have brought positional advantages for City (red lines). He chooses a lazy lateral pass for Bernardo Silva, who is stationary on the sideline in a backward position. Di Marco anticipates the Portuguese and launches Inter's offensive transition.*\n\nBefore and after that passage, Manchester City had given ample evidence that it was not at its brightest, and the impression was that, rather than suffering from tactical or technical problems, the performance of its players was affected by the terror of not winning a final in which the odds were totally skewed on their side. The ball traveled slower than usual, the solutions of play were conservative by tactical choice, but mostly trivial by fear of making mistakes, the technical brilliance needed to play Guardiola's soccer, which aims to manipulate opponents with the ball, soiled by the weight of the final.\n \nOn the other side of the field, Inzaghi's Inter, benefiting from City's difficulties, did not have too much difficulty containing their opponents' offensive maneuver. The mix of high-pressing blitzes and positional defense in their own half was more than enough to minimize the danger to Onana's goal. At the same time, Inter, with the ball between their feet, was also not as brilliant as at other times and did not take advantage offensively of the difficulties in City's ball circulation. City's defensive transition, a phase of the game on which Guardiola has relied heavily, prevailed over Inter's offensive one, which, before the goal conceded by Rodri, can only reproach itself for lacking courage in attacking the opponent's defensive line with more determination and more quality.\n\n**The choices of the two coaches**\n\nSimone Inzaghi did not give up Brozovic in the starting eleven, deployed \u00c7alhano\u011flu as left halfback and confirmed Dzeko paired with Lautaro in his 3-5-2 attack, with Lukaku and Mkhitaryan (back from a minor injury) on the bench. Pep Guardiola, often accused of overthinking in finals, fielded what can be considered his starting eleven in the final third of the season, with Ak\u00e9 on the field to complete the defensive quartet and Walker on the bench. However, the Catalan coach varied the position and duties of what has become since February his tactical pick, John Stones, altering the set-up of his team. In recent times, Stones had been employed as a central defender in the possession phase and, rising on the midfield line alongside Rodri, he drew the 3+2 build-up structure in City's 3-2-4-1 offensive phase. Against Inter Milan, however, Guardiola deployed Stones formally at right-back, with Akanji in the center of defense. In the possession phase, Stones did not flank Rodri by forming a structure with a doble pivote, but instead rose to the position of right half-back, with the team drawing a kind of 3-4-3 in the attacking phase with a rhombus midfield and the two very open offensive outfielders. In the midfield rhombus, at least until the middle of the first half, it was, rather surprisingly, De Bruyne who occupied the position of left halfback, with Gundogan acting as the advanced vertex.\n \n[[2]](https://i.imgur.com/SJkWGA6.jpg) *The 3-4-3 with City's rhombus midfield, with Stones rising to the position of right halfback, De Bruyne a left halfback and Gundogan a high vertex. Out of frame left outside back Grealish.*\n\nOne can only try to imagine the reasons why Pep Guardiola chose to deploy his midfield with a rhombus structure, rather than the square drawn by his more usual 3-2-4-1. It is possible that the City coach tried to take away close references from the two outside defenders of Inter's back trio - Darmian and Bastoni - who would have found in the two advanced 3-2-4-1 midfielders close opponents to orient themselves to, thus allowing Brozovic to focus, with a shielding job, in supporting Acerbi in controlling Haaland. Instead, the deployment with a single centre-half, set up centrally and vertically on the City striker, could perhaps have taken away references from Darmian and Bastoni, who would have had to stand up more to counter the two midfielders in City's midfield rhombus, and would have engaged Brozovic, freeing up space for Haaland.\n \n[[3]](https://i.imgur.com/lOZAHFY.jpg) *This is what Guardiola was probably looking for by deploying a midfield rhombus. Bastoni has to get up a lot on Stones, Brozovic is engaged by trequartista Gundogan, space is created for Haaland, isolating him, against Acerbi.*\n\nAt the same time, by removing Stones from the midfield line, Guardiola has theoretically weakened the embankment of his defensive transition, but he will probably have found this an all-too-manageable inconvenience. Inter's offensive transition generally prefers vertical balls to the forwards and therefore should not be countered too much in the middle of the field, but it is perhaps more important, by raising more men above the ball line in the possession phase, to quickly attack the ball carrier after losing possession in order to prevent him from triggering the attackers with a vertical play.\n \nHowever, City's tactical plan, as mentioned, clashed with its concrete application on the field: perhaps due to the emotion and fear of the performers, City's often rich and unpredictable ball circulation was as if neutered, ending up being mundane and incapable of generating advantages. Surprisingly, the man who was most able to raise the quality of Guardiola's team's play for almost the entire match was John Stones, a (former?) defender. Deployed as a halfback, he played his role with great dynamism, showing a remarkable understanding of space and resourcefulness that his teammates lacked. His movements, often timely and precise, gave City passing lines and set the stage for creating chances. Stones was the player with the most dribbles in the match (5 successful on 6 attempts) but his good offensive effort was not capitalized on by his teammates, with City finishing with only 7 shots on goal.\n \nGuardiola seemed to have solved some of his team's problems by swapping positions between De Bruyne and Gundogan midway through the first half, so as to have his best passer in more decisive positions. Not surprisingly, soon after, City created its best chance of the first half, thanks to Gundogan's reception behind Barella and De Bruyne's key pass to Haaland.\n \n[[4]](https://i.imgur.com/0CB0XNt.jpg) *Gundogan moved behind Barella and forced Darmian to get up to counter his reception. This time Rodri chooses a filtering pass that reaches his teammate who, first, serves De Bruyne who pulls Acerbi out of position and serves Haaland's deep cutback.*\n\nHaaland's very chance, propitiated by De Bruyne's new field position, provides the measure of how much City has potentially lost, in terms of offensive effectiveness, with the injury to the Belgian, who was unlucky and once again forced to leave a Champions League final after the injury caused to him by Rudiger in the game against Chelsea two years ago.\n \n**Inter's responses.**\n\nInter were not too surprised by the deployment adopted by City in the ball possession phase and, if they had not already been foreseen by Inzaghi during the preparation for the final, they were immediately able to find the appropriate countermeasures to the 3-4-3 rhombus formation of Guardiola's men.\n \nSimone Inzaghi's response was quite courageous and, although aided by City's lackluster day, very well implemented. Inter often varied the height of its pressure on City's first build-up, but, even at times when it lowered its center of gravity the most, its defense was never passive and pure space-occupation, but was always geared toward bringing pressure to bear on opposing ball-carriers. Of the two half-backs, it was Barella who, preferably, got up on the line of attackers to press in numerical parity the three City back players deputed to building. Rather bravely, Brozovic often abandoned his function as a screen in front of the defense, going into advanced aggression on Rodri. On the strong side, behind Barella, Darmian constantly shortened on City's left half-balance, while on the weak side, it was \u00c7alhano\u011flu who sewed the distances to cover the position left by Brozovic's advanced pressure, leaving free space, on the weak side, for City's right half-balance.\n \n[[5]](https://i.imgur.com/vRPs0qz.jpg) *Inter's pressing system with Barella getting up on Ak\u00e9, Darmian aggressive on left halfback De Bruyne, Brozovic high on Rodri, and \u00c7alhano\u011flu's inward scramble leaving the right halfback Stones free on the weak side.*\n\nOn the other side of the field, the pressure was not symmetrical to that on the right side, because with Dzeko central on Ruben Dias, on Akanji went Lautaro's pressure. Unlike Barella, \u00c7alhano\u011flu was thus able to take a more cautious position, which, in turn, allowed Bastoni to limit the exits on the opponent's halfback and thus support Acerbi in controlling Haaland.\n \nCity then tried to initiate the action predominantly on the left (Ak\u00e8 was the player who made the most passes in the, 74, and the line of passing from Ruben Dias and the Dutchman was the one most beaten) and the system of climbing triggered by Barella's high exit under pressure on Ak\u00e8 ended up freeing Stones on the weak side and also because of that he was so involved in the offensive phase. City's maneuvering, however, was not fluid and thus the rising of the ball lost its effectiveness, favoring Inter's work. Inzaghi's team, in any case, also helped itself: remarkable, for example, was the work of Acerbi (supported by Bastoni) on Haaland, who had very few opportunities to show off and receive balls (only 19 touches for the Norwegian, with 3 successful passes out of 8 attempted).\n \nIf Inter's non-possession phase appeared brave and well implemented, the same cannot be said for the possession and offensive transition phase. In the ball-possession phase, the Nerazzurri suffered from City's high and well-carried pressing, which pressed the low build-up of Inzaghi's men with four men, with the three forwards against the three defenders and De Bruyne in control of Brozovic. With Grealish and Bernardo Silva busy shielding the pass to the outside, directing the opponent's development inward, Gundogan and Rodri took care of Barella and \u00c7alhano\u011flu, with the full-backs ready to climb outward on any receptions by Dumfries and Dimarco.\n \n[[6]](https://i.imgur.com/IiflcsT.jpg) *City presses Inter's back three and Brozovic high with its four offensive men. Behind, Rodri and Gundogan take care of \u00c7alhano\u011flu's control.*\n\nTo overcome more easily the pressure brought in numerical parity by City, Inter, as usual, involved Onana in the construction of the game, but this was not enough to avoid too many long throws to the forwards, who then had to deal with a battery of central defenders all capable of not going under in individual duels.\n \nAt this stage Inter lacked the technical and tactical brilliance and courage that in other matches allowed it to get the better of the opponent's pressing thanks to dribbling and a marked fluidity of maneuver. Yesterday, Inzaghi's team took refuge too often - both in more structured phases of possession and in transition - in vertical plays towards Lautaro and Dzeko, who, however, were not able to make their usual contribution to bring the team up.\nThe entry of Lukaku, who also arrived a few minutes earlier than expected due to a problem for Dzeko, had seemed to be able to change the inertia of Inter's attack: on the first ball touched, the Belgian won an aerial duel with Ruber Dias, spiking an interesting ball toward Dumfries, who was, however, inaccurate in his handling.\n \n[[7]](https://i.imgur.com/LFyGSTA.jpg) *Lukaku's spurt gave a numerical superiority situation in the open field for Iter, which was wasted by Dumfries' errant pass, who looked for Lautaro with a cross, but found Akanji.*",

            "comment": "Immediately afterwards, a glaring mistake by Akanji, who let a ball flow backwards convinced of Ederson's intervention, gave Lautaro the best chance of the match so far. The Argentine, very defensively, tried his shot - hitting Ederson in the body - instead of trying (as invoked in the commentary) a pass to the center for Lukaku and Brozovic, which would not have been easy anyway.\n \nThis opportunity was like a wake-up call for City, which for a few minutes managed to turn up its offensive pressure and thus find the goal. The decisive action of the match is perhaps the most iconic symbol of Guardiola's team, with the finish coming from the back, almost on the edge of the small area. It was quite a long play, with City, after crushing Inter in their own area, pulling the ball out to restart on the weak side with Akanji leading the way. Bastoni on the edge of the area was perhaps too hasty and, instead of waiting for \u00c7alhano\u011flu to arrive to counter the Swiss defender, he was attracted by the ball and moved toward the opponent. Bernardo Silva, a true master of this movement, then slipped behind and was served by Akanji's filtering cross. Silva's cross, deflected by Acerbi, ended up in an empty area of the box where Rodri arrived like a hawk and coolly put the ball behind Onana.\n \n[[8]](https://i.imgur.com/IthW1PD.jpg), [[9]](https://i.imgur.com/ZjQ040J.jpg) *Akanji led, Bastoni was drawn to the ball, did not wait for \u00c7alhano\u011flu's rescue, and was slotted in behind by Bernardo Silva. Inter loses its Champions League final.*\n\nThe goal scored certainly did not appease City, who, in an advantageous situation, thus even more favored and with even more to lose, became, if possible, more stiffened. Guardiola's men were not able to keep the ball using possession as a defensive weapon (39% possession for City after Rodri's goal), they lowered the line of their pressing, giving away the field to Inter, and, despite the approximation of the opponent's attacks, the defense, with its insecurity, allowed a couple of rather sensational chances for the Nerazzurri to equalize.\n \nInter began to attack, but in a rather confused manner, relying more and more as the minutes passed on Onana's contribution in launching long shots toward the opponent's defense. The first of the two chances came from a steeple in the City penalty area lifted by a header from Dumfries. Akanji, pressed by Lukaku, failed to intervene and Dimarco pounced on the ball and with a lob header made after the ball had touched the ground hit the crossbar. The ball then returned to the head of the Inter outfielder, whose near-safe header was unintentionally blocked by Romelu Lukaku near the goal line (there was, however, a City defender behind him).\n \nIf that were not enough, in a tragic revival of other particularly unlucky matches for the Belgian - the Europa League final against Sevilla two years ago or the match with his national team against Croatia at last World Cup - Lukaku also missed, with two minutes left, an easy chance with which Inter, who by that point in the match had lifted Acerbi into a center forward position, could have equalized. Lukaku was served into the small area by the header from Gosens, who had entered the field precisely to attack the second post on crosses coming from the right, and, with the mirror practically wide open he directed his header into the exact spot of the goal where Ederson was placed, who managed to get the right reflex to repel the ball.\n \nAfter that occasion, suffering and defending their penalty area like a fort, Manchester City managed to hold on to the lead goal in the final minutes and win the first Champions League in their history.\n\n**Guardiola was right**\n\nWith the goal of winning his first Champions League outside Barcelona in mind, Guardiola had ended his tactical experiments by presenting himself at the knockout stage of the European competition with his surprising version with 4 central midfielders and a very strong focus on the defensive transition phase. The decision to armor this phase of the game affected not only the structure of the team and the choice of the starting XI - with 4 defensive center-backs and Mahrez and Foden on the bench in favor of more control-oriented rather than breakaway players - but also the ball possession phase, which became more cautious and conservative, albeit fully within Guardiola's principles of play.\n \nWith the exception of the fantastic return match in the semifinal with Real Madrid, Manchester City's Champions League was a particularly solid and offensively less brilliant team, because it was different, than other versions of City. Against Inter Milan, crushed by odds-on favorites, the memory of the final lost two years ago to Chelsea and, perhaps, their coach's obsession with winning the Cup, City added to tactical prudence an unnatural fear of making mistakes that sterilized its play. In the end, one well-played play was enough to win the first Champions League in the club's history.\n \nHowever, City's victory also came through its defensive phase, its ability to minimize risks with effective high pressing and excellent defensive transition. With the exception of Lukaku's chance - which remains a great one - the other two conceded came from individual errors, again more attributable to fear than to structural or tactical flaws. So, we can say, that even in the final it was the attention Guardiola placed on minimizing risks that made City win. From this point the Catalan coach was right: he won by going down a road that was not trivial for him, deciding, after analyzing all the possibilities, to give up something of his playing identity to add a new element. He did so because of Haaland's arrival, certainly, but also with his innovative spirit, which does not mean that one must always innovate to attack better.\n \nInter can take home the excellent game done with a courage and resourcefulness that almost annihilated the best team of the season. They lacked a bit of boldness and quality when they had to attack, but - trivially - it can also be explained by the characteristics of the men at Inzaghi's disposal, the fatigue of playing at the end of a season that seemed never-ending, and the strength of the opponent, which certainly invited attention. A bit of luck in the final, perhaps, could have changed the story of the match.\n\nThe assessment of his season, especially of his Champions League run, remains extremely positive. In his second year on the bench, Inzaghi has shown that he is a coach with clear ideas and capable of conveying them to his players. Inter, in a different way, played well and deserved every passage to the round until the final in Istanbul, both in direct clashes but also in the round. In the final it was not enough, because, as often happens in sports, the strongest won.\n\n___\n\nFWIW, the journo here is a UEFA-B coach. Not top level or anything, but it\u2019s refreshing reading something that has at least some technical background to it.",

The rest is just negotiation, and if Perez really took his word when he was allowed to sign a pre contract he\u2019s an idiot. Fans read waaaay too many headlines and none of them involved words from Mbappe.\n\nPerez feels burned because the insane financial offer he was able to put forward as one of the largest clubs in the world, was dwarfed by the new football power: nation states. It\u2019s not even about Mbappe at that point, just retaining the power within European football they\u2019ve enjoyed for a long time now. Not really the case anymore when it comes to signing the absolute biggest names in the world. Mbappe and Halaand play outside of Spain now",

Vinicius, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Camavinga, Tchouameni, Valverde, Araujo, Pedri, Gavi, De Jong, Kound\u00e9, Bald\u00e9 etc are all world class talents for the future. Barca signed Lewandowski just last summer.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 will play for Madrid sooner or later it's just a question of time. They had to literally get the Emir of Qatar and president of France to put political pressure on him and offer him whatever he wanted in order to stop the deal happening and still he didn't commit with a long term deal. Haaland will also play for Barca or Madrid at some point, they will be first in line as soon as he wants to try something new\n\nLa Liga has the best young players in the world and will definitely add more star names in their peak during the coming years",

All those players you listed are fantastic and La Liga has a tremendous amount of quality, but there\u2019s a certain level of status that the league and top clubs had when Ronaldo and Messi and before that R9 etc. treble winning sides who dominated Europe with the best superstars. Hell, half the Real Madrid project is about projecting the idea that they\u2019re the best club and the best players choose to come there.\n\nBenzema is a great example because he\u2019s part of the old guard, now exiting la Liga. Realistically, even for Vinicius and Bellingham, the next few Ballon d\u2019Or winners are not likely to come from Spain. This is only the beginning, City have now just won a treble with the highest goal scorer in all of Europe. PSG were able to overcome all the arguments in favor of following in the footsteps of many other galactico\u2019s.\n\nThey\u2019ve not signed top prospects before, but I think Flo was incensed they were even able to lose out on Mbappe in the first place",

That was a time when role of wingers was changing from being crossers to inside cutting forwards so left footed Bale on RW and left footed Ronaldo on the LW was literally the most logical trajectory forward for them as goalscorers.\n\nIn the case of Mbappe he's made very clear he doesn't like playing as the lone forward and keeps throwing tantrums regarding that regularly. I'm honestly just waiting for the shit show if and when he brings that drama to Madrid. They've done a great job with recruitment so far and it would be hilarious for them to get Mbappe now to fuck up the balance of that forward line instead of getting a real 9.",

Benzema would have never developed the balls he had last season without Ancelloti too. \n\nAncelloti\u2019s influence may be subtle, but it\u2019s there and it saddens me they can't see it.

Off the pitch there are plenty of unsubstantiated rumours that are usually shot down, but interviews\u2026he\u2019s fine. Recall that over the course of his formative years the only two players who can safely be considered to be at a level above him are pretty abnormal  in their attitude - they are utterly hilarious in their excessive humility and narcissism. In comparison he seems to be at a normal level of self awareness for a guy that gets offered half a billion euro contracts!",

It doesn't seem like United's striker woes would get addressed with a surefire top quality goalscorer this window. It's likely going to a gamble on a younger player and/or a semi-proven yet untested in the PL player. Ask anyone and their nan, and they'll tell you how we're aweful at transfer negotiations. Selling him in a year or two probably won't be a cake walk but shouldn't too hard either. It's not entirely out of the realm of possibility.  I don't see why people think Kane now means no Mbappe later or the other way around.",

However, I do touch upon very briefly on it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/13lk27o/-/jkqj0sm) Mbapp\u00e9 will be on the end of what Vini creates and will have a heat map very similar to Karim's with plenty of combinations with Vini. Vini hugs the touchline and picks the ball up in the middle third to dribble into the final third. Kylian plays much more advanced, off the shoulder in the half spaces to cut in and shoot.\n\nE - I just looked at the other comments in the thread and the other commenter is sort of right. Just compare the heat maps of the 3 players, but especially Karim and Kylian. Here are the league heat maps for this season. The point becomes even clearer when you keep in mind that the scale isn't consistent among players and go further seasons back.\n\n[Karim](https://www.sofascore.com/player/karim-benzema/3306)\n\n[Kylian](https://www.sofascore.com/player/kylian-mbappe/826643)\n\n[Vini](https://www.sofascore.com/player/vinicius-junior/868812)",

Further addition of Griezmann adds to the growing wage bill.\n\nThe wages pile up over the years. The Covid-19 pandemic hastens the arrival of the inevitable, a massive collapse of the hugely unsustainable wage structure. \n\nLaLiga\u2019s new rules and guidelines result in Barcelona being unable to register any new players. \n\nMessi\u2019s contract finally runs out and he too is left unable to sign a new one as a result.\n\nPSG swoop in at the opportunity and completes one of the most momentous transfer sagas of recent years.",

            "comment": "\"**According to the ruling, \"the Assembly was convened in breach of the Statutes\" and \"the documentation provided to the clubs was incomplete\".\"**\n\n**\"Madrid Court of First Instance number 47 has declared the nullity of the agreement between LaLiga and CVC at the Extraordinary General Assembly held on 12 August 2021. The judge upheld \"in its entirety the lawsuit filed\" by Real Madrid CF, FC Barcelona and Athletic Club de Bilbao. \"**\r  \n\r  \n**\"According to the ruling, to which EL ESPA\u00d1OL has had access, \"the rules of the call were violated and an operation of great magnitude, seasonal and economic, was submitted to vocation without providing all the necessary data to understand and assess its scope\".\"**\n\n**\"Javier Tebas infringed the Statutes of LaLiga by convening the Assembly and \"not motivating the urgency\". Likewise, \"the documentation provided to the clubs was incomplete\". In addition, the judge adds that \"the timing of the delivery of the Rothschild report, given the importance of the operation, did not allow for its correct analysis\".\"**\n\n\"**During the Assembly itself, \"a factor altering the terms of the Term Sheet submitted for discussion and the accompanying reports\" was introduced. This ruling is a milestone for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Athletic in their fight against the agreement between LaLiga and CVC. These three entities took legal action, both civil and criminal, against the president of LaLiga, against Javier de Jaime Guijarro, head of the CVC Fund, and against the CVC Capital Partners SICAV-FIS Fund itself.\"**\r  \n\r  \n**\"This ruling does not invalidate the agreement between LaLiga and CVC that was voted on 10 December 2021, which is denounced by the same three clubs as a \"misleading structure\". However, this ruling makes it more difficult for the LaLiga Impulso project and, as published by EL ESPA\u00d1OL, CVC is considering breaking the contract due to the lack of legal certainty using the exit clause it has.\"**\n\n\\[1/3\\]",

Surely they're not going to be okay with just calling that 2-3 billion a sunk cost. Would the clubs that took the money be on the hook for paying back the money they received? That'd break a majority of those clubs.",

The ruling states that this is \"consistent with the statement expressed\" by the entity presided over by Florentino P\u00e9rez during the assembly. \"**\r  \n\r\n\n**\"In addition, the judge considers it \"indisputable that during the Assembly an alteration was introduced in the operation that was on the agenda, consisting of the clubs that did not want to vote in favour retaining their television rights and being left out of the economic operation\". The ruling states that this \"alteration is not trivial\", and in fact the LaLiga representatives present at the Assembly used words such as \"reconfigure\" the operation and \"readapt\" the agreement.\"**\r  \n\r  \n**\"Therefore, that alteration in itself rendered the Term Sheet put to the vote no longer valid. The content of item 4 of the agenda was therefore modified. Athletic Club's representative, according to the letter, stated: \"The proposal is presented to us, in one week it is approved in the Delegate, in two weeks you have to vote it yes or no in the Assembly.... It's lentils. An operation on a fixed amount of 150 billion euros over 50 years, I think it really distorts a bit the supposed goodness of the competition\". \"**\r  \n\r  \n**\"The adjustment that was made to the operation left \"the reports provided in support of the operation invalid, both in economic, fiscal and legal terms\". Therefore, \"if the terms of the Term Sheet were altered, the valuation was no longer suitable to know the consequences of the operation\".\"**\n\n\\[2/3\\]",

To a question from the Espanyol representative, he showed his doubts and lack of knowledge: \"We don't know exactly, I can't tell you that\".  Despite this, \u00d3scar Mayo affirmed that \"the Term Sheet was binding\".\"**\n\n**\"Despite these irregularities in the adoption of the agreement, in the convening of the Assembly and in the modification of the agenda, LaLiga's Compliance department, headed by Esperanza Bernal-Quir\u00f3s, at no time warned of the illegalities, thus absolving itself of its responsibility. \"**\r  \n\r  \n**\"In a letter sent to the clubs on Friday, LaLiga has limited itself to indicating that this ruling does not affect the agreement of the Assembly of 10 December 2021. This is also being prosecuted in the Provincial Court of Madrid. Furthermore, according to its letter, \"this is limited to assessing whether or not there was a formal defect in the conditions of the call and in the adoption of the agreement\".\"**\r  \n\n\n\\[3/3\\]",

They're there in order to protect the clubs, as much as Barca/Real Madrid would have you believe otherwise.\n\nThe Premier League losing 1B during COVID and La Liga losing 900M during COVID are not the same 1:1 issue considering there are different TV deals, different distribution rights, and different ways of generating revenue. \n\nThese threads are dominated by fans of Barcelona/Real Madrid, but the reality is that 37 of Spain\u2019s 42 first and second-tier clubs voted in favour of the deal. It's nonsense to pretend the motivation was to pocket money, this is 37 football clubs all with their own finance teams who reviewed the deal themselves. I'm sure some people were selfish but that's not why the deal went through",

            "comment": "(LONG READ):\n\nAlright so having read a bit into this I must say a couple of things:\n\n- The headline is a tad misleading in that the agreement that was struck down was just the preliminary/first one and the reasons for its dismissal are formal defects during the process. It shouldn't affect the validity of the deal because the original August agreement was later \"ratified\" or properly signed later in December of that same year. In theory this should \"heal\" the formal defects that led to the August agreement being struck down by this ruling. \n\n- The reasons it was struck down have to do with the assembly being improperly convened and then improperly modifying the points of discussion. Also the right of information of the clubs was also violated given that many clubs barely had time to review the documents before it was voted on. The ruling is also not firm and could likely still be invalidated by a higher court since there's still 2 or 3 tribunals up the chain. \n\n- The December agreement is the subject of a different judicial process that will come at a later date. From what I understand, here the arguments are a tad different in that they aren't appealing against the formal procedure but against the structural core elements of the deal itself. So far the judge in that case has already denied the application of cautionary measures 3 times, with the latest coming last March.\n\n- This ruling paints Tebas in a VERY bad light for now because it seems to confirm numerous irregularities in the negotiating process, how some clubs were selectively kept in the dark and only informed last minute (like Real or Athletic) and how they scrambled to change the terms last minute when some clubs opposed. This is my personal opinion but for me this is a reason for Tebas resigning but of course he won't. \n\nThese are just some clarifications and if there's anyone who sees anything wrong feel free to correct me since I only have a basic grasp on Spanish Law (had to drop my degree halfway).",

Why would Barcelona and Madrid want a guy that wants them to share in the TV rights pot? Why would they want a guy that reduces the rest of the leagues dependence on the sale of their top players to the top 2 teams?\n\nWhen he took over, the biggest beneficiaries of Spanish welfare were the Spanish football clubs. Most of the clubs in the league had massive back tax debt including us (which was something like 8 or 9 times the amount that sent Glasgow Rangers into administration). The debt crisis in Spanish football has drastically been reduced.\n\nLaLiga TV rights were sold individually (massively benefiting Madrid and Barcelona since they can sell their brand and keep all the money). Even now with the centralized rights deals, Madrid and Barcelona have a favoured nations clause meaning they\u2019re going to be the top 2 paid in the league no matter where they finish on the table. Just imagine how encircled the league was by these two teams then, if even during the reign of the guy who supposedly despises them; they\u2019re getting favoured.",

Anyone who watched Barca during his last few years saw how insanely Messi was carrying the team (people who say Lewa was robbed of the Ballon d'Or Messi won are blind). The last 5 or so years of Messi's club career has been a \"what if?\" Neymar should've never left.\n\nAt least the World Cup is what he goes out on.\n\nBut even now, he still has a few years left in the tank for Europe as mostly a playmaker. Will be interesting to see how it goes with Argentina.\n\nIt's a pipe dream, but I've thought that there's a tiny, tiny chance he can do a Zlatan and go back to Barca in a few years. It would be predicted on Messi still performing at high levels in 2025 and wanting to gain extra sharpness for the 2026 World Cup.",

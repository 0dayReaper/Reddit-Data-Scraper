    "postText": "To be included in this table the player had to score at least 30 league goals in a single season since the year 2000 and the league, in which he did it, must have been a Top5 league at that time based on the [official UEFA country coefficients ranking](https://www.uefa.com/nationalassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2023).\n\nIn order to create a clearer overview, I split the seasons, which meet the criteria, into 2 tables: One showing seasons by Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and one showing seasons by everybody else. To no-one's surprise, Messi and CR7 have scored 30+ goals in the league most often by far and, in fact, would have made up almost half the table on their own if they had been included in the same table as the other players (17 out of total 40 seasons).\n\nWithout further ado, here are the stats for every 30+ league goals season by a Top5 league player since 2000 not named Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo:\n\nSeason|Player   |Goals (penalties)|Games|Goals per 90 min.|Games with at least 1 goal|3+ goals games\n:------:|:----------|:------:|:------:|:---------------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:\n2020/21 |  [](#sprite1-p8) Lewandowski| 41 (8)| 29| 1,50| 25/29 (86,2%)| 5/29 (17,2%)\n2015/16 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Su\u00e1rez|  40 (3)|  35|  1,14|  22/35 (62,9%)|  6/35 (17,1%)\n2022/23 |  [](#sprite1-p10) Haaland| 36 (7)| 35| 1,17| 23/35 (65,7%)| 4/35 (11,4%)\n2015/16 |  [](#sprite1-p75) Higua\u00edn|  36 (3)|  35|  1,09|  25/35 (71,4%)|  1/35 (2,9%)\n2021/22 |  [](#sprite1-p8) Lewandowski| 35 (5)| 29| 1,07| 24/34 (70,6%)| 2/34 (5,9%)\n2019/20 |  [](#sprite1-p189) Immobile|  36 (14)|  37|  1,02|  25/37 (67,6%)|  2/37 (5,4%)\n2016/17 |  [](#sprite1-p52) Dost|  34 (7)|  31|  1,13|  19/31 (61,3%)|  4/31 (12,9%)\n2019/20 |  [](#sprite1-p8) Lewandowski| 34 (5)|  31|  1,11|  25/31 (80,6%)|  1/31 (3,2%)\n2018/19 |  [](#sprite1-p35) Mbapp\u00e9|  33 (1)|  29|  1,28|  22/29 (75,9%)|  3/29 (10,3%)\n2008/09 |  [](#sprite1-p76) Forl\u00e1n|  32 (6)|  33|  1,02|  22/33 (66,7%)|  1/33 (3%)\n2015/16 |  [](#sprite1-p26) Jonas|  32 (7)|  34|  1,01|  20/34 (58,8%)|  1/34 (2,9%)\n2017/18 |  [](#sprite1-p3) Salah|  32 (1)|  36|  0,99|  24/36 (66,7%)|  1/36 (2,8%)\n2016/17 |  [](#sprite1-p12) Aubameyang| 31 (2)| 32| 1,00|  22/32 (68,8%)|  1/32 (3,1%)\n2013/14 |  [](#sprite1-p3) Su\u00e1rez|  31 (0)|  33|  0,94|  18/33 (54,5%)|  3/33 (9,1%)\n2005/06 |  [](#sprite1-p149) Toni| 31 (2)| 38| 0,86| 23/38 (60,5%)| 1/38 (2,6%)\n2015/16 |  [](#sprite1-p8) Lewandowski| 30 (2)|  32|  1,02|  19/32 (59,4%)|  1/32 (3,1%)\n2016/17 |  [](#sprite1-p8) Lewandowski| 30 (5)|  33|  0,97|  16/33 (48,5%)|  3/33 (9,1%)\n2008/09 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Eto'o| 30 (2)| 36| 0,92| 19/36 (52,8%)| 2/36 (5,6%)\n2017/18 |  [](#sprite1-p5) Kane| 30 (2)| 37| 0,88| 19/37 (51,4%)| 2/37 (5,4%)\n1999/00 |  [](#sprite1-p46) Phillips| 30 (6)| 36| 0,84| 20/36 (55,6%)| 1/36 (2,8%)\n2003/04 |  [](#sprite1-p1) Henry| 30 (7)| 37| 0,81| 20/37 (54,1%)| 2/37 (5,4%)\n2011/12 |  [](#sprite1-p1) van Persie| 30 (2)| 38| 0,81| 20/38 (52,6%)| 2/38 (5,3%)\n2022/23 |  [](#sprite1-p5) Kane| 30 (5)| 38| 0,79| 26/38 (68,4%)| 0\n\nFacts not considering Messi and CR7:\n\n* Out of the 23 times a player has scored 30+ league goals it has happened most often in England (8 times) and Germany (6), followed by Spain and Italy (3), Portugal (2) and France (1). Keep in mind that Bundesliga and Primeira Liga only have 34 matchdays instead of 38 like all the other leagues (Ligue 1 since 2002/03 and Serie A since 2004/05)\n* Only 3 players have done it more than once: Lewandowski (5 times), Su\u00e1rez and Kane (2 times each)\n* Su\u00e1rez is the only player who has done it not only for different clubs, but also in different leagues\n* Su\u00e1rez for Liverpool is the only player to finish a season without a penalty goal\n* Kane is the only player who has done it without scoring a hattrick\n* Lewandowski is the only player who has scored at least 1 goal in 80% of his league games (he has done it twice)\n* Lewy's 2020/21 season percentage of 86,2% games with at least 1 goal is the highest of all players even if you include Messi, who is the only other player to reach at least 80% (84,4% in 2012/13)\n* Even though both Cavani and Ibrahimovi\u0107 had remarkable seasons in Ligue 1 (Zlatan scored 30 and 38 goals in the 2012/13 and 2015/16 seasons; Cavani scored 35 goals in the 2016/17 season), they have to content themselves with only an honorable mention here since the French league was not a Top5 league at the time they had those seasons\n* Another honorable mention is due to Jardel who scored 37 goals in the Portuguese Primeira Liga\u2018s 1999/00 season and 42 goals in the 2001/02 season. However, he also did not make it into the table due to the fact that the Portuguese leauge was not a Top5 league back then\n\n\n______________________________________________________________\nNow let's take a look at \"the other half\" of the table which highlights how much better / more consistent Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi are than the rest of the forwards:\n\nSeason|Player   |Goals (penalties)|Games|Goals per 90 min.|Games with at least 1 goal|3+ goals games\n:------:|:-------------|:------:|:------:|:---------------:|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------:\n2011/12 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi|  50 (10)|  37|  1,38|  25/37 (67,6%)|  8/37 (21,6%)\n2014/15 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo|  48 (10)|  35|  1,39|  25/35 (71,4%)|  8/35 (22,9%)\n2012/13 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi|  46 (4)|  32|  1,58|  27/32 (84,4%)|  2/32 (6,3%)\n2011/12 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo| 46 (12)| 38| 1,23| 27/38 (71,1%)| 7/38 (18,4%)\n2014/15 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 43 (5)| 38| 1,15| 25/38 (65,8%)| 5/38 (13,2%)\n2010/11 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo| 40 (8)| 34| 1,24| 18/34 (52,9%)| 6/34 (17,6%)\n2016/17 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 37 (6)| 34| 1,18| 24/34 (70,6%)| 0\n2018/19 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 36 (4)| 34| 1,20| 23/34 (67,7%)| 3/34 (8,8%)\n2015/16 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo| 35 (6)| 36| 0,99| 20/36 (55,6%)| 3/36 (8,3%)\n2012/13 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo| 34 (6)| 34| 1,13| 20/34 (58,8%)| 3/34 (8,8%)\n2009/10 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 34 (1)| 35| 1,08| 20/35 (57,1%)| 3/35 (8,6%)\n2017/18 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 34 (2)| 36| 1,02| 21/36 (58,3%)| 4/36 (11,1%)\n2013/14 |  [](#sprite1-p9) Ronaldo| 31 (6)| 30| 1,10| 22/30 (73,3%)| 2/30 (6,7%)\n2007/08 |  [](#sprite1-p2) Ronaldo|  31 (4)|  34|  1,02|  21/34 (61,8%)|  1/34 (2,9%)\n2010/11 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 31 (4)| 33| 0,98| 20/33 (60,6%)| 2/33 (6,1%)\n2019/20 |  [](#sprite1-p17) Ronaldo| 31 (12)| 33| 0,96| 24/33 (72,7%)| 1/33 (3%)\n2020/21 |  [](#sprite1-p6) Messi| 30 (3)| 35| 0,89| 21/35 (60%)| 0\n\nFacts including all players:\n\n* Messi has the most 30+ league goals seasons (9) and the only player close to him is Cristiano Ronaldo (8)\n* Cristiano Ronaldo is the only player who has done it not only for 3 different clubs, but also in 3 different leagues\n* The Top3 highest goals per 90: Messi (1,58 in 2012/13), Lewandowski (1,50 in 2020/21), Cristiano Ronaldo (1,39 in 2014/15)\n* 12 years separate the first and the most recent of CR7's 30+ league goals seasons\n* Messi is the only player to score 30+ league goals without a single hattrick on two different occasions\n* Both Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored 40+ league goals 3 times in their careers\n* Messi holds the all-time record for most goals in a single La Liga season (50 in 2011/12), Lewandowski the all-time record for most goals in a single Bundesliga season (41 in 2020/21), Immobile and Higua\u00edn the all-time joint-record for most goals in a single Serie A season (36 in 2019/20 and 2015/16 respectively) and Haaland the all-time record for most goals in a single Premier League season (36 in 2022/23)\n______________________________________________________________\n\nTables sorted by Goals (minutes per goal as the tiebreaker)\n\nSources: https://www.transfermarkt.com, https://www.worldfootball.net/",

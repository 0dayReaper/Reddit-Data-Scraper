He is renowned for his tactical prowess and has managed FC Porto, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United. He has won a domestic title in a record four different countries (Portugal, England, Italy and Spain) and is one of only three managers to have won the UEFA Champions League twice with two clubs, FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010. He is also a three-time Premier League Champion with Chelsea (2005, 2006, 2015).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Commenting on the appointment, Chairman Daniel Levy said: \u201cIn Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.\u201d\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Speaking on his appointment, Jose said: \u201cI am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.\u201d",

Especially as it feels like we clearly engaged Jose behind his back. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure how to feel about Mourinho. My gut is that he\u2019s a very short term appointment; we\u2019ll likely see an improvement in performance (it can hardly deteriorate), and we may even challenge for a cup this season (which obviously isn\u2019t to be sniffed at), but long term, I can\u2019t see it working out amazingly.\n\nHowever, I think we need to be objective and accept that things with Poch may have past the point of return. Mourinho is a proven winner and we\u2019d have dreamed of a coach like him 5 years ago...It\u2019s ironic that Poch\u2019s legacy is making us relevant enough that Jose wants to manage us (and a large majority of the fans are upset about it).\n\nUltimately, all we can do now is get behind Mourinho and the boys and see where this goes. It might not be pretty, but it could definitely be effective.",

Also we're turning the World Cup into a 180 team competition with 24 rounds of qualifiers and 30 groups of 6 teams. \n\nWhy is there so many muscle injuries? Do you guys actually not enjoy seeing your best players stretchered off in crucial games and missing half the season, causing you to drop points you wouldn't otherwise have dropped?",

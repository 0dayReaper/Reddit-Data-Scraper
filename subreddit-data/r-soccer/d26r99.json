From day to day things like singing somebody happy birthday to bigger events like weddings and parties, there is just a different atmosphere here in Brazil. And this goes the other way too; I am more of a homebody and significantly less extroverted than anybody I know. I struggle mightily day to day because I simply do not have the disposition to be \"on\" all of the time like everybody else. Brazil just might be the worst country to be an introvert in the world. And that is not a bad thing, really; people always say Brazil is a shithole from afar (it is in many apsects), but every foreigner I meet that visited the country loved it.",

The only high level games I'm able to watch up close and really experience in a way more visceral than TV are my university's games (top 20 ranked D1 school). I'm amazed at how much faster, stronger, composed, and skilled these guys are than me. But only 1 or 2 guys on the field is good enough to have a chance at playing in a league like MLS. And then your standard average player on an MLS squad is nowhere near being able to hack it in one of the big 4 European leagues. The number of distinct tiers of ability in any competitive venture is astounding",

My job wasn\u2019t to score at this level, it was to get us a power play so the good guys could score. \n\nAnd these guys were *good*. Lightning fast, amazing hands, etc.  \n\nWell, our best player led the conference in goals and points and won the conference MVP. Absolute stud, best player I\u2019ve ever played with. He got signed to go play for the top league in Sweden. \n\nHe filled out my role.  \n\nHe became a bottom six pest, defensive minded player.  And he wasn\u2019t good enough for it. \n\nGot sent down. \n\nEnded up leaving for the German League. \n\nTwo years later he\u2019s out of professional hockey. \n\nThe skill that these professionals have is so absolutely insane.  I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like playing with NHLers or KHLers.",

He\u2019d score goals from the half way line at least once a match and he honestly strolled around dominating whilst not even breaking a sweat. I remember one time he was running to get the ball and a fast player tried to get it from him, and the he just ran even faster meaning he was just jogging before.\n\nThe thing was that he eventually was inches away from signing a pro contract but didn\u2019t make it and is now in the lower leagues iirc. You need to be super good and also have some luck on your side.",

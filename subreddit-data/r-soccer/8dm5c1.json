Working miracles with kids and small means compared to for example oil money. Close to winning the league on at least two occasions.\n- The end with 3 FA cups and maybe, maybe an EL title to crown in all.\n\nGive it a few years and most people will forget about the struggles.\n\nNow Arsene, get to writing those memoirs!\n\n\n\nEdit: transition, not transgression.

When they first decided to build a new stadium and move away from Highbury it was back when having a big stadium with lots of expensive tickets was one of the key figures on the clubs balance sheet. But then TV money went crazy, and so it became less important to have a big stadium so the rewards Arsenal were anticipating never fully occurred. They may have still had similar issues but if they had waited 10 years it would have been easier for them to buy more players as they could more easily cover costs. In comparison to Juventus and Bayern I don't really know their situations and how they raised money and shit. ",

At that age I didn't care or know much about football, but I never had a good relationship with my parents but every 3rd day I got to see him in the stands, watch his team play and I fell in love with Arsenal later in my years, and I realized that he was a good father figure, he took care of the young players at the club and gave them a chance with his faith. And these last years I've watch a man that I loved, turn into a broken man, a punching bag for everyone to take a jab at, it wasn't right, and he didn't deserve it!\n\n\nI am glad that Wenger is leaving the club so he, himself can live the life that he deserve. Off on an island with his wine and books that he enjoys here in life. He will always be a great mentor and most importantly a great human being.\n\n\nIf he decides to stay in football, I will for sure watch every single game of his newest team. \n\n\nTo Wenger!",

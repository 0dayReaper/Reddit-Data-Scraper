Basically, if over a presidential term the club registers losses, they have to be pocketed by the board of directors OR the president (don't remember exactly).\n\nAt least that's the rule for Madrid, and I'd expect it to be the same for barcelona since they have the same legal status. That's why every madrid president needs to bring a big fat check with him as \"guarantee\" that he can indeed support the club's eventual losses.",

Last year was a rare moment. We have a history of being trouble to Feyenoord or PSV but never Ajax.\n\nI hope we can do something nice this season, but i'm not getting my hopes up. half our team consists of youth players that are barely can play KKD let alone eredivisie. Just hope that Anita and van der Wiel kan bring a solid defense cause we are still heavily lacking in offense.",

            "comment": " This whole saga eerily reminds me of dysfunctional relationships. In the end it is for the best, Barca can now enter a post-Messi era in earnest and make most of the talent they have (and the talent they will continue to entice) without having to bend over backwards to keep an insidiously fragile and imbalanced dynamic out on the pitch and in their managerial structure\u2014which despite having the capability to compete at high levels, I think it was pretty clear internally people weren\u2019t in the same page at all.  \n \n\nAs for Messi, this doesn\u2019t change the broad picture of his legacy in my opinion. He will always be about Barca, he has given everything he possibly could for the club he loves, some would argue even to the point of undermining some of his potential to be more dominant at the collective level (which I don\u2019t think is fair--moving to a different club has its own challenges, like Ronaldo and Neymar have experienced). And of course this is his childhood club, the city he loves, where his kids are growing up\u2026 there is an undeniable romantic notion in him being with the club through hell or high water. But if we earnestly look at his career, what more is there for him to prove? The Barca he inherited in Rijkaard\u2019s and Ronaldinho\u2019s wake had its own set of issues, and while the club was undeniably in an upward trend, this extent of European dominance Barca has enjoyed has been built on the back of h im (and of course the genius of that golden generation + Pep). I prefer to think that the calamitous fall against Bayern is also a kind of romantic ending, upsetting and bitter, but also candid and real.  \n \\`  \n Barca fans should take heart. Messi will always be linked to the club and city he loves, moving somewhere else won\u2019t change that. Once his playing career is over, who is to say he won\u2019t come back to the club in some (less overbearing) capacity? And it may be a challenge for Barcelona in the immediate future, but they have the heritage, talent, and devotion of people waiting in the wings, once Barto leaves, to see things through",

Not seeing him at Liverpool either. I could see Real going all in for him because it would be an absolute banger signing for them and Messi + family could stay in spain... \n\nImo it's City&gt;&gt;&gt; PSG &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Real&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bayern and Liverpool\n\nIt's prolly the biggest signing in football history, if it actually happens",

Good old times when a team like CSKA could win international titles on the back of epic performances of a young, talented goalkeeper. I reckon it was just a case of \"why go abroad when big money home do trick\" like many other Russian players - Russian football had a significant influx of cash &amp; investment from early 2000s and the wealth gap in football was not as big. Top Russian players could remain in their comfort zone, be treated like kings and still make almost as much as they would in Europe. He probably didn't wanna risk it while things were good in Moscow. Maybe he would indeed turn into one of the best GKs but I think he doesn't regret being a club legend. The dude was playing for CSKA before the term \"Rus\" existed.",

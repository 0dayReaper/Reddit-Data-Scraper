He has spent enough time touching and kicking soccer balls in every which way that he can make shit up on the fly and have it work out well\n\nI juggle soccer balls with my feet, and after a time you learn enough basic interactions between the ball, the air, the ground and your feet that you can freestyle and mess about with the ball, improvising.      \nLike a jazz musician is able to improvise if they spend their time practicing the fundamentals of music enough that they can instantly call on their muscle memory at a moment's notice without thinking.",

His takes as a pundit are good and you can see he genuinely loves the game and understands it. He is one of Mbappes idols so could only help in keeping him here longer and he isn\u2019t afraid of being critical about different things. He also has a good amount of experience as assman for belgium and he seemed to help Lukaku a lot, and Lukaku was an absolute machine for them.",

The gk coach which was in the club forever and favored Manuel and was a close friend to him. Got sacked by Nagel bc he didn't pay attention to the other gks. Ofc that didn't go well with manual. And since then reports started coming out of fractions in the locker room. But that apparently was just bs bc when Nagel got sacked. Players came out supporting him",

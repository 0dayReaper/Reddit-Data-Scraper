I remember trying to analyze him as a soccer player when he was a child. He has always been my idol. Then as a technician I looked very hard at him. He was a technician who had the ability to get the most out of practically all the players I directed and that perhaps many of them did not have the talent. He had the ability to maximize them. He is a reference for me\n\nhttps://sportsfinding.com/bordalas-im-surprised-they-call-me-little-mourinho/19631/\n\nand\n\n&gt; Bordal\u00e1s is 55 years old and grew up with Cruijff as a football player. \u201cI remember watching all the games back then. We went to an uncle's bar where there was a colour television. We didn't have one at home. We saw the World Cup in colour and then Cruijff noticed me,' says Bordal\u00e1s. After that I saw him at FC Barcelona. He was my idol. I tried to imitate Cruijff as well.\u201d\n\n&gt; As a trainer Cruijff also made a big impression on the current trainer of Getafe CF. \u201cHe knew how to get the most out of his players\u201d. They then talked about the Dream Team. \u201cThey had players who were perhaps not as talented as other players. They had players like Bakero and Goicoetxea who weren't very talented, but Cruijff managed to get the most out of them. The perfect trainer is a trainer who knows how to get the most out of his players\u201d.\n\n&gt; The names of Rinus Michels, Johan Neeskens, John Rep, Ruud Krol and Cruijff soon fall. \u201cThey are Dutch people who made the whole world feast on great football. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola still applies Cruijff's style on a daily basis. They talked about total football and that's it. It has had a fundamental influence on the football that was later developed at FC Barcelona\u201d, says Bordal\u00e1s, who has seen FC Barcelona play football in the same way for years now.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/f6glpm/getafe_coach_bord%C3%A1las_im_surprised_i_get_called/fi4mft7/",

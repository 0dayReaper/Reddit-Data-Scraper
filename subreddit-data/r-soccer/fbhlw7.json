You can talk about how they didn't get nearly as many points as Liverpool/City last season, and how easily Liverpool will pass their points tally this season and what not, but that Arsenal team achieved a unique feat that is almost impossible to break, not even by this Liverpool side that is on course to break the total points record in English top flight history. To not slip up once in 38 games against all these teams that are fighting for their lives to beat you is so impressive.",

Finding a community and then with that community engaging in conflict with other communities.\n\nHumans are the only species we know of that has the unique capacity to control their instinctual drives but their lives are still heavily dominated by them. We've evolved these really complex social structures based off these instinutal drives but also a self and societal imposed moral restriction and desire to control these instinutal drives to what we've set our own priorities to be.\n\nWe really don't have any other example of that to relate too so it's kind of hard to see stuck in the middle of it.\n\nLong winded way of saying you'll always find someone that will object to anything in this super connected world because we are wired that way to improve the species as a whole and its being expressed in this artifical scenario that we've created that human genetics can't keep up with.\n\nSo in this age of social media people feel more and more removed from a community and thus desperately want to latch on to something that feels tangible and identifiable. Nothing brings social creatures together more then aggresion against anything. It's not rooted in evolved reasoned logic it's rooted in a very ancient and simple part of the brain.",

Back down to Earth it may not be, but with Emery's 5 captain's stuff it looked like he didn't want any single team-leader but player power spread out, following on from his rant about Neymar owning/calling the shots it looked like he wanted to be a normal in-control manager, almost scarred by it, and targeted the highest earner, Mesut, to make a point out of him, made him captain, took it away, played him, dropped him, week in week out, made a proper (if pointless) example of him, showing everybody who is boss.\n\nMesut, say what you want, doesn't seem to be the player who has a mentality suited to this. And I feel this has contributed a good deal to it.\n\nAt any rate, if you just want a fun cartoon this is what I refer to: [https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jan/23/david-squires-on-mesut-ozil-and-unai-emerys-relationship](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jan/23/david-squires-on-mesut-ozil-and-unai-emerys-relationship)",

He is not a leader and you\u2019d be blind as a gooner not to see the problems we\u2019ve had with him, but he is my favorite player because of his style and skill which even this season he has shown a handful of times. Personally, I think a lot people forget that Arsenal football club as a whole was always struggling when Ozil was.",

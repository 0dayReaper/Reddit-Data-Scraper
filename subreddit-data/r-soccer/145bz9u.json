GUESS WHAT. AJAX ALSO WON THEIR ONLY TREBLE THAT YEAR, AND BECAME THE SECOND EUROPEAN CLUB TO DO SO. \n\nHAHAHAHAHA I fucking love football man\n\nEdit - one replier enlightened me that barca juve 2015 final was also a guaranteed treblemaker like 2010, thanks. \n\nAnother replier enlightened me that, devastatingly, neither real in 64 or benfica in 65 actually won their doubles those seasons! They both won their titles, and then lost those European cup finals to inter while still being in their cup competitions, and Then both got knocked out of their cups afterwards. So inter Did derail 2 treble charges, but it's not quite as amazing as we first thought. Lmao \n\nIn for a penny, in for a pound, in that case. In the 2010 round of last 16, they also knocked out Chelsea, who went on to win the double that year for the first time. So, just to shimmy my fucking club into this conversation, there's another treble that inter potentially killed. Football, bloody hell",

I missed most of maldini's career because I'm not a 100 years old, but by the time I started enjoying televised football around 06, Nesta was the most serious defender around. A one man wall playing alongside one of games biggest legends, Maldini. Was a sight.",

Sometimes it would be Nesta &amp; Stam, Maldini on the left side.\nAnd then later it would be Nesta &amp; prime Thiago Silva.\n\nInsane amount of historically world class defenders there.",

To make matters worse they had Gattuso shielding them in front.\n\nWhat an absolute monstrosity of a defence. That doesn't even touch on the fact that they had Dida in goal, Pirlo and Seedorf in midfield, and then Shevchenko, Crespo, and Inzaghi up top.\n\nEdit: You can tell that's a mental lineup because I forget their fucking Ballon D'Or winner... Kaka as well.",

They're clearly the best team in Europe. And Inter lost to Monza, so what are they even doing in the CL if even Monza is better than them.\n\nNot to mention that you're completely disregarding the fact that City's attacking players simply played a bad game yesterday. They're a team that scored 152 goals this season.",

He has taken tips from Cholo(and signing Trippier from there surely helps)",

Did you know that they are one of the highest scoring teams in Europe since the World Cup?\n\nThe fact that you instantly leap from a comparison with Simeone(one of the best coaches in the world) to taking it as an insult shows your utter ignorance lmao",

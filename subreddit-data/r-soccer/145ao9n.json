As Guardiola said if the game is 0-0 City is not losing so I dont expect City go all out from min 1. Also, i think Dzeko is better than Lukaku from corner kick and set pieces. Truth is no one knows how the game is going to play out. I agree with you that if City goes high pressing all out from min 1, Lukaku might be better choice because of his speed. Of course Inzaghi can do wrong. He has done it with Gagliardini over and over again but choice Dzeko over Lukaku is not as simple as everyone seem to think.",

Any Chelsea fan arguing taking him was a bad choice should rather be thankful or get called an ungrateful whining spoiled brat.\n\nFor any club in the world it'd be worth it a thousand percent to get a godlike keeper for a year if it allowed you to win the Champions' League that year. The level of entitlement is beyond the stratosphere.\n\nKeepers that strong are a rariry among gems. And those who can keep that level of performance consistently are even rarer. Onana too had a small drop after his highlight season with Ajax. Predicting how good and reliable a keeper is gonna be is never an easy task. And reasoning after the fact is always the dumbest way to make conclusions.",

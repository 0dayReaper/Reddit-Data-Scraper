We've seen him hit another level with Belgium and he will do the same on a much better club team with a higher level of play and player talent.",

He\u2019s been the only competent attacker for most of the season and could flourish in a better team. Can\u2019t do progressive passes when no teammates come up to support him. For 5m there\u2019s going to be a lot more suitors I\u2019d imagine",

            "comment": "&gt;KAA Gent is pleased to announce the arrival of Japanese Tsuyoshi Watanabe. The 26-year-old central defender comes over from KV Kortrijk and signed a contract for four seasons. \n\n&gt;Last season, Watanabe was the mainstay of KV Kortrijk. He played all matches and did not miss a single minute throughout the season. The Kortrijk supporters therefore rightly voted their star player Player of the Year.\n\n&gt;At 1m86, Watanabe is a physically strong defender. He joined Kortrijk in January 2022 from FC Tokyo, where he would stay for a season and a half. Earlier in his career, \"Tsu\" was also selected for Japan's national team.\n\n&gt;&gt;\"Tsuyoshi proved his qualities at KV Kortrijk last season and was therefore automatically on the radar of KAA Gent and our coach. We always strive to add players who are hungry and have something to prove.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;\"With Tsuyoshi, we bring in such a player. He is a reliable central defender, a professional at heart, and has a great will to win. We look forward to seeing him in our defence next season\" - Samuel Cardenas, Head of Scouting\n\n&gt;We wish Tsuyoshi every success, welcome!",

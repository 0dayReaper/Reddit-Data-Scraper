If there is any chance we win, it would bring great joy knowing that he knows he didn't make any valuable contribution to getting us the cup.",

At which point, he used his calculator and easily came to the conclusion of signing for PSG.\n\nFirst thing you learn in sales is not to sell on price, but to sell on value. We had Skriniar sold on a lower wage, but higher non financial benefits, but when we shat all over those terms and treated him like a number, he treated us like a number and we lost.\n\nAnyway, he's gone now. It's unfortunate, it's sad, and I wish he stayed, buttttt, he's dead to me now, Inter comes first. Fuck Skriniar.",

They hamstrung Suning by changing the foreign sports investment rules. At the start they allowed them (meaning Chinese billionaires) to spend money on sports outside of China hoping it would grow the game inside the country and eventually become a football powerhouse. It hasn\u2019t yielded any results so the CCP stopped them from doing so. \n\nAny Chinese billionaire that owns or partially owns a sports club/team is because they want to move their money out of China and CCP control. The CCP figured out what they were doing and halted it. \n\nInter\u2019s debt is prior to Suning\u2019s take over. Suning spent a pretty penny on the club prior to the new regulations and now it is effecting the club by a large margin. \n\nSo really the anger should be pointed at the CCP and not the Zhang family. Ya they are getting sued left and right but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that they can get their money out of China.",

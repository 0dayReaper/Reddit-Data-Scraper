That didn\u2019t stop them from nearly winning this world cup and essentially shutting down a superb France team for most of the final. If we can learn anything from this world cup, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t need a bunch of superstars to be a winning team. A solid lineup with good chemistry and smart game planning can go a long way. Thats what a team like Argentina lacked, despite having one of the best players in the world in Messi as well as other well established players from successful clubs. \n\nThe England team looks promising, and I can definitely see the lads making another deep run in four years if they can utilize the many talents that their players showed in this world cup.",

You didn't play cynical and park the bus hoping and praying for a France slip-up. You guys went out there and played like fucking lions from the start. You were not even slightly intimidated. You played through injuries, on 1 day less rest, and after having already played 90 more minutes than your opponent. You even got a couple of terrible calls going against you as well imo.\n\nDespite all that, you played a spectacular game. A beautiful game.\n\nCroatia, you're Rocky Balboa in Rocky 1. You lost the fight to Apollo Creed, but you gave us an unforgettable fucking show! Respect.",

Seeing tens of thousands of Belgians celebrating when our squad returned to Brussels has stimulated a feeling of one united country.

That is, what sets them apart from other smaller nations making deep runs into the world cup. At some point it didn't feel like a surprise anymore when they won, it felt nearly natural, as if a big soccer nation advanced to the final.\n\nAlso, I completely forgot about Croatia at the beginning of the world cup, until I saw their line-up for the first time.

To be 2nd placed team in most popular competition in the world where privilege is to just be amongst 32 teams competing, let alone to be a finalist is simply amazing.\n\n I was also depressed as fuck when game ended (especially having 'what if' moments and those 2 decisions leaving a bit of a bitter taste in mouth), but still at the end I'm proud as fuck because when you look at it realistically this is amazing achievement and before WC started I would bit someone's hand off for 2nd place.",

They out manouvered every opponent from a tactical perspective, they outworked ever my team in terms of sheer effort on the field, they had better composure than any other team, they played together more and supported each other like brothers. Combine that all with an incredible spirit, mental toughness,100% relentlessness and refusal to lose, and honestly I feel it should go down (from a team perspective) as one of the greatest performances in the entire history of sport. \n\n\n\n\n",

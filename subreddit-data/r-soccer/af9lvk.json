    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom now on The Sun will no longer be a source allowed on the sub.\n\nThe Sun as a publication has been boycotted by 70 sets of fans of English clubs over the coverage of Hillsborough and other pieces of coverage. Clubs themselves have also joined in this protest by banning the publication from conferences.\n\nWe firmly believe that nothing of value will be lost here. The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead.\n\nThis ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria. The reliability and content quality of sources should still be governed by the community using upvotes and downvotes.  \n\n\nWe'll update everyone in a few days about the rest of the meta thread, just thought this is worth its own post first as it would obviously dominate the comments, which is understandable.

Hillsborough coverage gives the mods a reason to ban the paper that does not set precedent of mods deciding which paper is good and which is bad, as the reason uniquely applies to The Sun.\n\nBasically, mods want to avoid being policing nazis, while still banning shit papers that add nothing of value.

(Portsmouth FA cup final, and Blackpool in Championship playoffs). \n\nBut the Liverpool one was most enjoyable. Took you to penalties, and only lost because Anthony Gerrard wanted to do his cousin a favour ;). \n\nI did enjoy singing \u2018we\u2019ve been here three times....we\u2019ll show you the way\u2019 in Wembley station. \n\nAnd you guys are always a good laugh. I spent one Boxing Day in the Kop with my mate who is a Liverpool fan. Had a great time of it. ",

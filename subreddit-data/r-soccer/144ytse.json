And the historically successful clubs haven't gone away, we've just added an even more insurmountable mountain for the smaller clubs to climb above the existing ones.",

Yes United would make way more than Villa each year but Villa has breathing space to improve and catchup. You can't do that when you are in a league with multiple oil clubs that not only can offer more money for players but can do it year on year without risk of going bust.",

They were amazing. \n\nI say when we played Red Star in the 91 European super cup that was by far the best club side I ever saw play at old Trafford. Amazing.. Other world like.\n\nWe absolutely robbed them that night 1.0, but I would put that red star team up against any team I've seen United play in the 46 years I've seen my team play",

Of course more clubs will win it for the first time in the early years of a competition. \n\nIf a different team won it every year for 10 years and the same teams all won it again over the next 10 years then both 10 years would be exactly the same, except the first period had 10 new winners and the second had 0.",

The way I look at it is we should just erase titles won with Ronaldo or Messi, because they were both so unfair to any competition. If we do that, no team can really win more than once a decade. Madrid did it around 2000 and Milan also won a lot in the 90s and 2000s. But otherwise, once a decade is the best a team can hope for, and that's pretty good disparity, if you ask me. \n\nChelsea - 2012, 2021\n\nMunich - 2001, 2013, 2020\n\nLiverpool - 2005, 2019\n\nMan U - 1999, 2008\n\nOn top of that, many teams have been perpetual contenders year after year, but never even won it in my life time. Arsenal were invincibles and had an all-time great team in the early 2000s, Juventus had two finals with fantastic teams that probably deserved a win, PSG have been contenders for years, Atl\u00e9tico also had two finals. \n\nOnce per decade. Only Milan, Madrid, and Messi can do better than that. We still have to see how it plays out in the power vacuum with no Ronaldo and Messi, but we are about to have 5 different winners in five years, which hasn't happened since 2010-2014. I find the rotation of winners, except for Madrid with Ronaldo, to be satisfactory.",

Have we become so used to the current hegemony that we think this is actually fine and how it has always been?\n\nOnly the big two from Spain, the PL and Bayern have won the CL now for 12 years straight (since the introduction of FFP, funnily enough). And barring a minor miracle on Saturday -- which is only a faint possibility to begin with because the draw dumped all the richest teams on one side -- that's not stopping any time soon.\n\nThe current world of top-level football, whether you look at revenue, wage bills, squad value etc. is entirely dominated by eight sides: Real, Barcelona, Bayern, PSG, Man City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man Utd. Arsenal have begun spending heavily and surprise, surprise, they're now entering the conversation too, as will Newcastle in the coming years as well.\n\nEveryone else trying to reach the top level needn't bother, you are wasting your time. European club football isn't cyclical anymore, it's static, fixed in place. And the only way to break that status quo is to get an extremely rich new owner, and then toss FFP out the window like it's a hot turd.",

But the league being dominated by two or three wealthy teams has been the case for the whole Premier League era. \n\nBarring the occasional Blackburn or Leicester miracle, basically only a couple of teams have ever had any realistic chance of winning things. Man U were just as dominant as City are now in the 90s and early 2000s.\n\nIf City had never got money, that problem would still exist, it would just be a different one of the usual candidates winning.",

They made sure that smaller clubs have to go through a crazy number of games just to qualify for the competition. Europa was advertised as the solution to the problem they created and now the same thing occured to it - so we now have the Conference League, which will probably have the same fate. \n\nThese format changes to the big competitions, alongside the crazy amounts of dirty money being poured into the sport has turned it into what it is today. \n\nUEFA does not want smaller teams to reach the big stages as they dont bring in nearly as much money. They want the big teams that have already built strong brands to play as many games as possible. EVERY format change since has encouraged this. They disguise it as making the competition more \"fair\" and \"less random\". It is, in fact, less random - also safer to predict how much money they will make off it.\n\nTeams like City, Chelsea and PSG are just the bi-product of the football landscape that was created by UEFA's greed. These owners saw the opportunity to have their brand associated to ones that already had a big following. To cheat their way to the top and have the future generations accept them as the norm. \n\nI'm worried something like the Super League is almost inevitable in the future. It's something that all the big club owners want. UEFA just wants to organise it.",

There is so much meat to get into, why blow hot air instead?\n\nYou don't need to write a Pulitzer Prize winning piece to know that the art and form in which City rose from being a lower Premier League mid-table side to the outright best team in the world within 15 years is incredibly problematic, that state owned clubs sponsoring themselves through other state owned companies is wrong, that owning multiple clubs is wrong, that totalitarian regimes using cultural institutions as soft power leverage hurts the spirit of sport, that having players and managers sign double contracts is wrong, that signing partnerships with shell corporations is wrong, on and on it goes.\n\nAt the same time people who pretend football was always this fair, competitive, organised utopia are delusional, but that shouldn't take away from the average fan to want to strive for a better future where there is at least some resemblence of a better system that prioritises football and human beings above anything else.",

In generally it is just that the highest level of football (CL-calibre teams) is moving in a direction where there are essentially a small number of uber-elite teams and then everyone else and only when the stars align perfectly, is another club able to challenge their supremacy.  This isn't a new trend, it has been going on for decades, but it is just making top-level football rather boring.  I've stopped going to top flight games.   The only matches I actually attend these days are for local lower-league sides.  At the end of the day I don't see a solution, thus my complaint is simply that this is making football boring and too predictable.  \n\n- In the last 10 years there have been only 5 different clubs to win the CL.  In the 10 years prior there were 7 different winners. In the 10 years prior to that there were 8.\n\n- In the 31 years of the premier league era.  Man City, Man United, Arsenal, and Chelsea have won the league 28 of 31 times.\n\n- You have to go back 20 years in Spain to find a winner that isn't Real Madrid, Barca or Atletico.\n\n- Bayern basically own the Bundesliga.\n\nThere isn't really any point or argument I'm trying to make beyond, the concentration of wealth among a handful of clubs is making the game boring.  The only solutions I guess are either stricter financial rules, or just hope that more and more super wealthy people start buying more and more football clubs.",

I\u2019d rather see the money go into the players pockets even if it means that clubs who generate more revenue will remain the only ones consistently competitive. However, if there was a salary cap in combination ticket prices and tv revenue was also made cheaper for consumers as the operating costs for clubs will be reduced significantly, especially for the bigger clubs with large wage bills, then this would be ideal, players would still rightly get a good portion of the revenue and consumers would get cheaper access to the product we all love.",

            "comment": "This is a really poor article. There's two separate discussions. It briefly engages with the financing issues/alleged rule breaking with a link to the wrong FFP rules, but the main discussion surrounds the argument that City are dominating in a way that has changed the game. This is bullshit.\n\nA single team has dominated English football for more than 50 years.  Before that we had the anarchy of the Post War periods, but there were dominant periods when the game was stable. \n\nWe had roughly , 20 years of Liverpool dominance, 20 years of Man Utd dominance, and now 10 years of City dominance. City over the last 12 years of title winning had been **less** dominant than Liverpool and Utd were in their periods. (see image below)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KZcO5kg.jpg\n\nThere has never been the concept of a 8 potential title winners. The article on this point is simply wrong. There is a concept of the Top Four, a historical term that for the fact that winners were likely to come from a small group of teams and it took a few years to create a title challenging team. We've recently had the concept of the BIG 4 or BIG 6, referring to a group of clubs that dominate the top of the league through extra European competitions money.\n\nI would argue that it is now far less likely that a team from outside the main title challengers can win the league. But that is due to the Big 4/5 getting extra money from European appearances, and nothing to with City. That was particularly bad during the 00's but a slightly improved with an increase in Premiership money levelling it partially out, but the imbalance is still there.",

Haaland is a monster and demands so much attention that teams can\u2019t play high up the pitch. Even if he doesn\u2019t score he is constantly running around pulling defenders deep. And if they don\u2019t have the ball he is hassling them right up to midfield. \n\nCity are blessed right now to have Haaland, KDB, and Rodri. The three best players at their positions right now.",

De Bruyne and Haaland are like the extra bit that makes city unbeatable. But rodri is the spine of the team",

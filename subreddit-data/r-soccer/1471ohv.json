Sponsorship has *next to fuck all to do* with state ownership of clubs.There's an ocean between taking \u00a320m to put a logo on a shirt and literally operating as the fully funded sportswashing arm of a human rights abusing theocracy, and the people who are claiming they're just two shades of the same colour are those that need to give their heads a wobble. This \"yr just jealous\" angle is particularly toxic because it assumes everyone obviously just wants to completely sell themselves out for infinite money, and would if they could - I think it speaks more about the accuser than the accused.",

Bayern's was 378m.\n\nThe discrepancy between them comes almost entirely from the advantage in broadcasting revenue City get from playing in the premiership; 294m vs 207m. \n\nBayern's \"inability\" to compete (already dubious given their overall revenue was still 90% of City's claimed) has absolutely nothing to do with City or their ownership, but it's much easier to use them as a scape goat than it is to take a step back and ask why it might be no one outside Germany wants to watch the Bundesliga.",

In fact, they ended up just using it to pay for Mane, who's on 423k a week vs Haaland who's on the equivalent of 468k. \n\nThis idea that they can't compete financially is just a pretence so they can justify concessions to the 50+1 rule, and you people are falling for it because you never bother to look up the actual figures.",

We've already seen Australia move to the AFC and there's precedent of Israel playing in the European league.      \nThe Arabian league is always going to be very limited in its audience, regardless of how much money they spend and while the AFC has a huge population, it seems more difficult to make its Champions League equivalent a big thing. Having just the Club World Cup as a chance to play one major European club, once a year, just doesn't seem worth it.",

I would keep him just for set pieces alone given how reliant we are on them for goals.\n\nHis dribbling for a CB is quite insane. As long as mourinho benches him against lazio we should be fine.\n\nBut problem is we need money now we can't sell tammy or kumbulla. Bournemouth aren't buying vina. \n\nSo he prime candidate for getting sold.",

Roma has a negative net spend on transfers every year. So to me it's not that strange they got a FFP restriction.

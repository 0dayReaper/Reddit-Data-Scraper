For elite academies, you can't recruit players under 12 who live more than 60 mins away. It's a common phrase in England (e.g. lots of schools will have a catchment area too)\n\nSpurs' problem is that their catchment area obviously overlaps heavily with Arsenal's, and they've made the problem worse with the placement of their new facilities. No idea if it was an oversight or pure arrogance.",

Conte was always win now but couldn't do it. Mourinho was a strange choice and the less said about Nuno the better. It's a big step up for Ange but if it works it could reap benefits for them. He plays attractive effective football that might work. If I was Kane I'd still be looking for the door, though giving it one last dash might be worth it. The problem for him is teams like Bayern and Real will look for a top striker now and if he doesn't jump ship to them then he might never get the chance.\n\nOfc football is hard to predict, but he really has to think about it. And if he goes, god knows Spurs are going to be in really bad shape.",

There's beens lots of progress in respect of methods and intent the last decade; nevermind the last two decades.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the other hand, he barely played any kids for Celtic - even when they were clear in the league/ had wrapped it up and when they were winning games by large margins. Now, there need to be kids quality enough to play mind, so it's perhaps not all on him as head coach. There's also talk that he was acting in a more DOF / Director of Academy role at Celtic too - which means he was more involved - however theres only slight murmurings on that though and nothing notable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHis success at Celtic was based on his style, man management and spending a LOT of money (well).",

He was the Australia u20s coach for like 5 years. \n\nAnd one thing you're missing is that maybe Celtics youth players just aren't very good. All the the decent ones get poached before they're 18",

Spurs have backed managers to a certain degree and there have been some pretty significant misses in the market which has hurt the team.\n\nBut Levy has also set parameters to work within that managers clearly find frustrating.  Mourinho and Conte are quite temperamental, but it's also not a coincidence that they literally complained about the same sort of thing.  An unmotivated squad and a restrictive transfer policy which resulted in an noncompetitive team.\n\nI don't know what Spurs fans and Spurs board really expect at this point.  Are they expecting to win a title?  Finish top 4?  Finish top 6?  What's the realistic goal for their team if you want to work under these conditions?\n\nRealistically, it seems like Spurs have regressed to a top 7 side who can occasionally get into the top 4 if they get a bit lucky.  Newcastle's money and United's improved competence has pushed Spurs down the pecking order unless they really buy extremely well.",

Richarlison has been played out of position to ensure he gets minutes but he's not as good as Kulusevski on the wing.\n\nPeople meme the signing as one of the worst signings of the season, but when you look at it, the odds were always against Richarlison. To expect someone to adapt to a new position in order to get minutes and still have the same impact they were having for Everton and Brazil is insane. As for the \u00a360 million, it is definitely a high price, but if Kane gets injured, I'm relieved in knowing there is another number 9 to take up his position.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong I enjoyed the disaster that was Conte\u2019s final couple months at Spurs, but it\u2019s really hard to argue it was anyone\u2019s fault besides his. Levy doesn\u2019t tend to be right very often but he absolutely is here. Not only did Conte\u2019s purchases almost all flop, but most of them are at an age where it will be almost impossible to turn a profit on them and they\u2019re now stuck with a bunch of guys Conte wanted while he\u2019s long gone. That\u2019s of course ignoring his outright refusal to play the literal one player the club asked for even though their RB options were shite for 2/3rds of the year. \n\nIt\u2019s probably the one time I\u2019ve been annoyed about everyone always making fun of Spurs. He made horrible signings, was completely out of his depth tactically, and yet he accepted no public responsibility, blamed the players, and repeatedly insulted the club and its fans in an attempt to deflect from the fact that the entire league had figured out his dinosaur tactics in less than 6 months. Like I said, it takes a whole lot for me to stand up for Spurs but the guy is a complete prick and it\u2019ll always make me laugh that he had a go at them for their history having managed Juve and Chelsea lmfao. Their history may not be trophy filled but at least it\u2019s not filled with cheating and stretched beyond this century.\n\nEdit: this sub is so fucking broken man how are people trying to argue this when I have spurs fans agreeing with me?",

Can he do it effectively? Sure, he\u2019s a really good player, but that\u2019s objectively not good investment. The only positive signing has been Bentancur, and even he was ran into the ground by Conte until his knee gave out. \n\nI don\u2019t care how much a big 6 team invests, they can spend as much and as little as they want and ultimately that won\u2019t matter much because it\u2019s about how you invest the money. Conte\u2019s well known to have a reputation as someone who forces his clubs to buy \u201chis type\u201d of players who are often old and one dimensional and sometimes it works but when it doesn\u2019t it leaves you in the absolute shit show that Spurs are in right now from a squad stand point and that\u2019s 100% on Conte.\n\nEdit: also, even if it wasn\u2019t on Conte. He has no right to go at the club, its fans, and it\u2019s players, when his tactics and investment were the biggest reason why they were struggling. He\u2019s a complete dickhead who embarrassed himself massively and just happened to get lucky that the club he was at was Tottenham so he could spin the public against them easily.

Your play was smooth, natural and open - just so beautiful to watch. Goes to show this style of play is both practical and enjoyable to watch.\n\nI honestly don't blame Levy for Conte at all. We were in dire straits with Nuno, on the back of humiliating losses to Chelsea, Arsenal and United within the span of a month. It reached a fever pitch in the United game when Spurs' fans practically boo'd the team out of the stadium. Any sensible person would have chosen Conte at that point to relieve us of Nuno - he was/is a serial winner and gets results. We actually looked good with him to close out that season, until this year when the \"pragmatic\" defensive footballing took a toll. \n\nI'm glad we're through this stage though with Mourinho and Conte. Hopefully it serves as a hard precedent in the future that this philosophy of play is NOT something we should experiment with again. Cheers!",

Our fast and lethal direct counter attacks through the middle were replaced by giving the ball to the wing backs and then having them fire off unsuccessful crosses over and over. \n\nBasically, last season was a hybrid style based on how we were playing before Conte arrived, whereas this season was full-on Conteball.",

Potch, their best manager in years, never received appropriate backing, significant signings started happening after he left. Not to mention how imbalanced the squad is, signing big money Richy for the bench, while the backline is in shambles. I personally feel that each of these things greatly hampered spurs in winning a trophy: imagine if Mou got to play the cup final (his record is good), imagine if potch wasnt working with scraps, imagine is Konte had the right quality defenders for his system, etc. Levy is on course to become an Arsenal legend at this point, surely hes a double agent",

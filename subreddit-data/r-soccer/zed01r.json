[It\u2019s buried in an article ](https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/does-bringing-substitutes-on-for-penalty-shootouts-ever-work) but someone counted.  From 1986 to 2021 (so after the finals of the Euros) in major tournaments the success rate of players bought on in the last minute is 40% whereas the success rate of players bought on after the 100th minute (so deep into extra time but not *right* at the death) is 77%, which I believe is pretty much where the xG for a penalty is.  \n\n**TLDR**: if you\u2019re bringing a guy on to take a penalty it will probably be fine if he gets more than ten minutes to get into the game.",

The epitome of tiki-taka! The keeper eagerly waits as Spain maintains possession in his area during the taking of the penalty. It\u2019s 5 against him and Spain keeps passing around trying to find an opening. This is how the game is supposed to be played! Suddenly, after 30 minutes, there\u2019s an opening! After the 120th pass, the ball makes it\u2019s way to the striker. Outside the box and struggling for balance he manages a weak shot that goes wide. The penalty shootout lasts 2 hours. Spain manage over 800 passes (a new record in penalty shootouts)! Final score 3-0 for Marroco.",

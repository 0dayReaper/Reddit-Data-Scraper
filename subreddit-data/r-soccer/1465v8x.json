Eliminated by Fiorentina and West Ham, the finalists.\n\nOh and last year your delegation lost to Tottenham (okay, that can happen, but Vitesse did beat them) and Partizan, while ours only lost to AS Roma, who won the damn thing.\n\nYour top teams will still end up in the EL like we get PSV, Feyenoord and often AZ in there. We'll see if they do better there. We'll also see if you're as good at harvesting points in the conference league as we have been.\n\nBut no need to dunk on us for being \"conference league merchants\" when we're well aware of how it helped us.",

Roma lost to a dirty English ref, Inter lost because  Lukaku was playing for City.\n\nUnlike your club who basically had their 1st chance of winning the league in 10 years, but instead as usual you decided to bend over and play dead just to gift the league trophy once again to Bayern. Schadenfreude.",

You'd expect them to have chances then and city could have found space on the break plenty of times but we kept players back to defend. \n\nInter played really well defensively but they weren't the better team.",

Inzaghi obliterated pep and the players played to perfection. Unlucky on your goal and unlucky to miss our chances, but xG 0.9-2 says more than enough",

Because you know that any mistake at any moment can crush people's lifelong dream, and that the margin between glory and failure is so incredibly thin\n\nJust think you have a strange perspective if you actually care about that stuff in a CL final.

Pep was obviously uncomfortable on the sideline, he wasn't happy with what he saw at all. And City literally gave up 3 100% chances(counting Lautaro's chance from the backpass, where he could have played in Brozovic for an open goal). City didn't even defend well yesterday and anyone who thinks that they were in control are kidding themselves. Even after Rodri's goal they looked extremely nervous at the back\n\n&gt;Secondly I watch a lot of football and that was just a meh game\n\nIf you watch a lot of football, surely you would know that it is just standard for a big final. 9 out of 10 times the matches are very cautious that is nothing new. If free flowing football is all you are looking for, then you probably shouldn't even watch CL finals lol",

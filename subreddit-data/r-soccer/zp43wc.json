Truly one of the all time greats, a legend, and I am relieved to see him lift the trophy.\n\nMost of the France squad still have a few world cups in them or already have the prize from 2018.

Enzo and Mac Allister impressed me the most, they will be stalwarts in their midfield for years.\n\nMbappe, take a bow. Holy shit what a player, what a menace. He will be have a stronghold on the Ballon d\u2019or for the next decade.\n\nAnd lastly, Lionel Messi\u2026first time I watched him was Chelsea-Barcelona 2006 UCL QF. Instantly became my favourite player, followed his career and saw his rise to become the greatest ever. Now he is a world champion. After 2018 I thought we would never see this happen.

Specially when he has an history of decisions which will make clubs less interested in buying him.",

Our league and finances will never bring us back that status. We are one of the best second line clubs in Europe. But the very top is becoming smaller and smaller.\n\nWe appear to have stability now but our finances usually aren't secure enough for big mistakes. If the guy flops 30M can compromise the club for a while. A 5-10M flop is much different to a 30M one on large wages. Mendes can move everyone but let's not make it harder.\n\nAnd less face it, he isn't moving to Benfica because he likes the project, he is moving to us because we are the best catapult club in Europe secure a big move later. Like Darwin, Enzo etc.\n\nWe are a selling club and always will be because our league isn't big enough. We have the advantage that we have nice weather and a great infrastructure and a reputation of getting players big moves. It is great to see us take advantage of that but we have to be careful, a couple of failed projects can ruin that.\n\nWe all dream of a good European run. We had one this year where there was a clear pathway to the final.  But one injury in the league to Bah was enough to throw away any chance and almost the league itself.\n\nYes we need to find someone so we don't have to play the chiquinhos on the big matches but i am sure there are players for much cheaper who can do the job.\n\nMaybe he will come in and be incredible. But 30M is a huge risk for us imo.",

It's Enzo's position and after Enzo left, Schmidt took Chiquinho, who never played in that role and was a fringe player, and made him a starter and playing great. \n\nIm excited to see what he does with a better player. It's also a role teams are needy for right now. If he plays well for Benfica, many clubs will be interested",

I don't think it's a bad decision at all from his perspective though, and I understand if it was matter of the club not wanting to stand in his way.",

The guy is far from a tactical genius, even with great players Porto lacked big time and he has a kink for overpriced shitty players. \"Garra\" only goes so far. \n\nIt is kinda remarkable how by pure sheer will Porto battled for the first spot, but even with him, with a much better squad, we already saw his team being really shit and still winning because there wasnt any competition but a Benfica also trying to sabotage themselves in the second Lage season. Season where he gone from giving his place and having SD wanting to beat him up to loved because he was the least bad.",

He barely even played this season, having like what, maybe 80 min or less. He wasn\u2019t even on the bench of most matches. Zaidu, Marcano and Wendell are awful too.\n\nIt\u2019s not really the manager\u2019s fault. He maybe asked for a couple of players, but it\u2019s Porto\u2019s sporting director who controls who comes and goes. S\u00e9rgio eventually got mad and said if this next season he doesn\u2019t get the players he wants, he\u2019ll leave.\n\nOn the other hand, Benfica had LFV before and we got the new president Rui Costa which had to adapt and change things (especially the shit ex-president LFV did). So Jorge Jesus got kicked out, cuz he was utter garbage since he came back. Many players he had hired were also not good enough and had to go. Some of them costed a fortune like 20M, and just weren\u2019t good enough, didn\u2019t even cut it half of what they should\u2019ve been.\n\nSo, you can see now how every factor contributes to a clusterfuck of entangled shit. Also, Lage got ran out the next season, because I believe the squad was underwhelming and not good enough, he barely got any reinforcements, and we also had a very basic style of game. It didn\u2019t took long to our opponents to start to understand how we played and to counter that.",

Oh, and the Ze Luis debacle with the Porto Canal interview and etc.\n\nMaybe it's me, but, besides not liking him as a man, I just don't rate him high and any football fan can understand that tactically we always were really lackluster, mega basic and rudimental. I guess he is a great motivator and the most impressive year for him was this year because of the squad lack of quality, even tho Porto got a lot of penalties in the end of games to bail them out or it would be a lot more lopsided. But with much better teams he almost failed or failed and was near being fired, he is not this supra sumo he wants people to think he is.",

One could argue that right now Feyenoord is just as good though (+ CL) and they might have a point, but generally speaking Benfica is still slightly more appealing.",

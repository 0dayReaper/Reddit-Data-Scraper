Qatar granted the right to vote to both women and men in the context of the 1999 elections to a \"Central City Council\" 25,26. These elections - the first ever held in Qatar - were deliberately held on March 8, 1999, International Women's Day.\n\nQatar sent female athletes to the 2012 Summer Olympics, which began in London on 27 July.\n\nSince the 1990s, the status of Qatari women has improved significantly, both in terms of their place in society and in terms of rights. Sheikha Mozah has been particularly vocal in advocating for the cause of women by encouraging conferences on the subject, advocating for better education, and calling for the creation of a position on the status of women in the office. Ministerial.\n\nAs a result of these advances, Qatari women have been able to secure career opportunities, including leadership positions in education, banking, health services, humanitarian organizations, right, and even diplomacy. According to the Qatari Embassy28, women are present in the fields of education, health, journalism, aviation, banking, politics, finance and tourism. Between 36 and 42 per cent of Qatari women are employed, and experts say women's rights are strengthening29,30.\n\nIn 1999, Qatar granted women the right to vote, as well as the possibility of gaining access to important positions in the government, whether in appointments or elective terms. In 2015, two women are elected to sit among the 29 members of the country's Municipal Council. In November 2017, Qatar appointed 4 women to the Shura Advisory Council, a first in the history of this institution.\n\nNo special clothing is imposed on women, who can dress as they wish in public (although in practice Qatari women usually wear the black abaya).\n\nThey also have the right to drive in Qatar (this right existed long before the arrival of Hamad). Except for women members of the Emir's family, who can not drive themselves for reasons of \"royal order\", which wants the women of the ruling family to benefit from drivers.\n\nIn April 2018, Qatar allows women over the age of 18 to perform military service for the first time, even though some already have administrative functions in the military.\"",

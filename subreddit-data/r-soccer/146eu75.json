Earlier 00s I feel like we (South Americans) were falling behind, but still competing and putting up with stronger teams. After that the money concentration became so much worse. The tactical shift with juego de posicion and gegenpress didn't help either. I feel like in Brazil we're still trying to catch up with that.",

However it's unlikely that Julian would beat his record since the carabao cup final might be held after his 24th birthday. He needs to win community shield , carabao , super cup and club world cup. He can't win confederations cup though.",

He reminds me of Morata or higuian. Both have had many successes but also has that \u201cmeme\u201d feeling about them\n\nAlvarez seems genuinely good. Had he been in any other team that doesn\u2019t have a man named haaland ahead of him, he would be starting and making an even bigger name for himself.

Doesn't matter how many chances he misses, it doesn't affect him and just keeps going. That is a very underrated quality to have",

He can play anywhere in the front 3, even crazy impactful as a sub, creativity, clinical finishing, link-up play, he does everything really well.\n\nHe's miles more versatile than Lautaro can ever be.\n\nLautaro is better in the air I'll say and probably has better movement but Julian scores 35 goals if he starts for City, he has 17 being a sub, that's crazy output considering Pep rarely likes subbing his starters. \n\nWe'll see a 30-goal season very soon and I know Pep will use him more next season. Objectively right now Julian is the better forward ability wise but he still needs to establish some stats with more responsibility to be considered indefinitely better.",

The submission in question also needs to contain relevant new information regarding the potential move, and not just being a \"no/minor developments\" report.   \n\nIf there are important/official developments or new valuable information about a saga, we will allow extra threads in the same day, but for the rest of minor news please just comment them as a reply to this comment.

What I feel like is that they do all the work mid season so when transfer window opens it's easy to secure him. Also because their rivals aren't interested in their players for some reason.\n\nAt least that is what I speculate.",

I think we finished above Villa in all but one of the last 7 seasons but oh how the tables have turned. It didn\u2019t need to be like this, relegation was entirely avoidable but the club owners sleepwalked into it. I wish Tielemans the best given he finally brought home the FA Cup to Fosse Way but given he never signed a contract extension with us because he wanted to play Champions League and then really took his foot of the gas this season it doesn\u2019t leave a pleasant taste. \n\nAt the end of the day the lesson for mid table clubs is to cash in on your best players when you can and have succession planning in place. Brighton showing us how it\u2019s supposed to be done. \n\nI think he\u2019ll be a good signing for Villa. The player was clearly not motivated for us but he will be for them.",

The first two seasons of \"Champions League\" (which is now considered CL but at the time it was in varying phases) only had the Champions competing.\n\nEven the first \"proper\" CL where it was the CL all throughout in 94-95, had still the champions and it did for two more seasons.\n\nThe first where you had 2 teams from the same country competing was 97-98. Then in 99-2000 you had up to 4 teams from the same country.\n\nSo where do make the cut? On the first name change with the same format? On the second name change ? On the first tournament with full CL branding? On the first tournament with non-Champions allowed? On the first time with 4 teams from the same country?\n\nMaybe we should just make it easy and start from scratch with the 24/25 format and that's it. Simpler.",

Or you don't understand what clutch means.\n\n2018 final, 0 goals.\n\n2017 final, 2 goals.\n\n2016 final, 0 goals.\n\n2014 final, 1 penalty with the game 3-1 on the minute 120+.\n\n2009 final, 0 goals.\n\n2008 final, 1 goal, 1 missed penalty on the shootout.\n\nA clutch player in the final was Sergio Ramos. He scored the 1-1 on minute 90+ on 2014. And scored his team's only goal on the 2016 final as well. That's clutch, a defender showing up on the finals and score crucial goals.",

What are you expecting him to do?\n\nHe goes for the header on the corner, and he falls. He's literally standing up when the pass to Godin happens. He follows the ball and sees Khedira jumping for it... And Godin heads it in a way that beats Casillas who was out of position.\n\nWhat did you realistically expect Ramos to do?\n\nHere, [watch the play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji021RYgGXQ&amp;t=25s).\n\nI can't believe you are faulting Ramos for that goal. It's such a weird take.\n\n&gt; being clutch for a centre back includes defending properly\n\nWhat you are saying is that if a forward misses a chance, then his goals only compensate, they are not clutch anymore. So since an attacker job is to score, if Cristiano miss any chance, whichever goal he scored gets cancelled? \n\nThere has to be no clutch players ever.\n\n&gt; if you wanted to pick someone more clutch Bale is literally right there\n\nIf I wanted to pick someone that scores on all finals that's Di Mar\u00eda for Argentina, that's the easy pick.\n\nI decided to someone that represents the biggest definition of clutch, that is scoring at the hardest moment when everything was lost to save the team. That's why I chose that Ramos goal.",

It is more often than not decided by 1-2 goals. Opponents are likely to try and mark out the likes of Ronaldo and play with their chances. You don't need to score in every final to be clutch.

Missing one _is_ important, because that makes you certainly not clutch.\n\nIt's not that hard to understand. You are expected to score the penalty. You didn't create the chance, nothing, you just took it. Missing though is important as you shouldn't be missing a key penalty if you are \"clutch\".\n\nAlso, the winning one is actually the least clutch. Literally by definition, if you miss then you would be even with the other team, otherwise it wouldn't be the winning one. So yeah, it's even less clutch.",

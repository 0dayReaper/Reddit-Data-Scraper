It just seems so weird to me, I can't imagine being in a relationship where sex wasn't mutual and just a given basically. If I'd have to earn it like this and feel like I've been given a \"prize\" I'd be completely shocked.\n\nIs it a thing in some cultures? Maybe in the US? (I'm not American sorry).\n\nEdit: I'm not talking about comments like this about people who weren't already in a relationship. That's legitimate and funny. I'm talking about the concept, or at least feeling I get, that sex is some holy grail thing that you have to earn in relationships for some. And considering it's a pretty mainstream joke, it seems to be the norm.\n\nSorry again for sounding really clueless, I just had to ask..",

I also nearly got bulldozed by Jacques Maghoma as he was barged over the ad boards but luckily landed in the row of teenage lads right in front of me and broke a chair.",

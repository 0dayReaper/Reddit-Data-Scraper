    "postText": "Luka Modric's continuity at Real Madrid is not as clear as it seemed a few weeks ago. As reported by Miguel \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz in Tiempo de Juego, the Croatian has a very tempting offer from Saudi Arabia on the table that has grown considerably over the last few days, and the feeling on the table is that his departure is possible.\n\nSpecifically, according to Miguel Angel Diaz, one of the ambitions of the Saudi Arabian league is that the last Golden Ball players play in their league. They achieved this with Cristiano Ronaldo and Benzema, but it could not be so with Messi, who has escaped them and has chosen to sign for Inter Miami of Major League Soccer. This has meant that the offer has increased from the country, to the point where it is almost an offer that can\u2019t be refused for Modric.\n\nIt is a similar case to that of Benzema. Just a few days ago, his continuity seemed 100% confirmed and half signed, but now there are so many doubts that anything can happen in the next few hours. The signing of Bellingham also favours having the future of the midfield assured, with Tchouam\u00e9ni, Camavinga and the Englishman. It remains to be seen what happens in a long summer market.",

He didn't  film the incident himself, access his phone, come up with the idea, ask to be involved, or threaten Valbuena. Benzema's fault for keeping bad company, but all he \"did to Valbuena\" was get roped in and give questionable advice (suggesting to meet with and pay someone). The main issue for Valbuena was that such a scandal could cause him to miss Euro 2016, which it did. He obviously wasn't happy about that but he just wants to move on at this point. \"For me the most important thing is to be able to move on, because 7 years is a long time. I\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m not bitter against anyway, everyone can simply go off on their merry way.\u201d (June 2022 interview with RMC Sport)\n\nI'm not saying that Benzema is an exemplary human off the pitch, but there's also going too far in the other direction. What he did in that case was stupid, not malicious, and he doesn't have any other pending criminal charges or history (besides the Zahia Dehar case in which the charges were dropped).",

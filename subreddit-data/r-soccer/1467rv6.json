The disparity between the top 4 or 5, and the rest of the league, in ALL of the big 4 leagues in Europe, is  downright ridiculous and shameful, and somehow people keep sticking up for that system. Where teams can swoop in, buy great players, and buy a championship. It's exactly why everyone hates the new York Yankees. The NHL has a HARD salary cap, and also a salary FLOOR.... a minimum amount that HAS to get spent on the team. And that's what makes it so great. So much parity in the league",

If half of it was one sided the last half was certainly great. Anyways, I'm happy to see Pep win and Messi win end of the day so I'm not complaining about either",

On the other side Lukaku and Lautaro just don't have enough (which is why Alvarez played in most WC games). That's probably why WC final was more Topsy-turvy\n\nArgentina maybe had more hype but France is better in most all positions and were the defending champs. I think most people would say France is the most stacked national team by far currently so in my eyes they were favorites",

Sure he's got all the money to spend, so do PSG, yet City back Pep despite their obsession with the UCL and not having won it for such a long time under him. Any team would be willing to pick up Pep, coz teams that are willing to spend will always love to have him as an option. People talk about unlimited funds, but not about the scrutiny that comes with it. Pep clearly looks like the manager you bring when u got the money to spend but need that to coach to get it through",

However to claim that he is the goat manager is a stretch considering that there are other managers who also achieved remarkable heights but without the same resources pep has.",

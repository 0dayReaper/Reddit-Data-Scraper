But the summer is long, and if Lens hold to their position long enough, I'm confident there will be some good PL team that will show interest in him. And then Leipzig won't be able to compete with the offer they will do to Lens, and to Openda as well.",

Openda probably wouldn't just accept any offer though. He's too good for a team risking relegation. If he wants to play in the Champions League next season, Leipzig or staying at Lens are likely the only options as I don't see any of the top 4 PL teams going for him. For what it's worth, our sporting director has been in contact with him for moths a he's already been \"convinced of the project\" since visiting Leipzig 5 weeks ago.",

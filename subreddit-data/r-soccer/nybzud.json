F1 is so safe nowadays that the chances of anyone being even slightly hurt in a 'routine' accident is incredibly small. It is the strange crashes that are dangerous - if it looks surreal, it is more likely to be a problem. And in football, when a player goes down off the ball unexpectedly it is typically something worse than a normal tackle.",

If Erikson even gets attention 5 minutes later, he could have ended up with brain damage or worse. Its a game of time when someone has a cardiac episode, so those medics could have very well saved his life. If you haven't done a CPR training I'd say its worth it to know how to act in these situations and what procedures to take.",

I quit soon after (actually I was forced to quit my job as a nurse because I was so traumatized I couldn't do my job properly anymore and used to be a benzo (xanax, lexomil) addict and I suffer from PTSD from watching all those patients die, with the exact eyes Eriksen had after he collapsed.). \n\nI remember the reason I wanted to be a nurse was when I saw Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 die on the pitch, I was 13 back then. The same \"dead eyes\" as Eriksen on this day. I'm glad Eriksen is okay now, but my PTSD is now back and after a year of sobriety, I'm going to waste myself with alcohol just so I can sleep without dreaming about the dead eyes I've dreamt so much more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm glad he's okay, I'm just devastated, I swore to myself after being unable to be a nurse anymore that I wouldn't have to watch the dead eyes stare.

I believe it would be one of the biggest changes to the offside rule since its invention to prevent goal-hanging.\n\nThe last major change to the offside was in 1925.  It is one of the major defining change to football.\n\nThe two-player rule was one of the more significant rule changes in the history of the game during the 20th century. It led to an immediate change in the style of play, with the game becoming more stretched, \"short passing giv[ing] way to longer balls\", and the development of the W-M formation.[99] It also led to an increase in goalscoring: 4,700 goals were scored in 1,848 Football League games in 1924\u201325. This number rose to 6,373 goals (from the same number of games) in 1925\u201326.[25]\n\n\n-----\n\nAs for stopping marginal call, this change is not aimed at that.  Marginal call mean that the defender line (offside line) and the attacker line are very close.  Hence marginal.\n\nThere is no physical law on earth that would undo that.",

Nobody know until it is implemented.  That is why FIFA is currently trialing it with over 500 matches.  The data from these 500 matches will inform those in charge of IFAB to make an informed decision whether to adopt it or not.\n\nIf this change is good for football, why not do it?  Similar to how in 1925, IFAB decided that 2 defenders offside law is better for football compare to 3 defenders offside law.  Anyone want to revert back to that offside law that favored the defenders heavily?\n\nWorse case scenario:  500 matches trial show that it is good for football.  IFAB adopts it and it SUCKS bad for some reason.  Good news is that we won't be stuck with it since IFAB can always reverse it back a year later.",

I would not be surprised if IFAB adopt it and most football would love it after seeing it in action for a few years.  \n\nJust like how in 1926, football loves it when IFAB changed the offside rule from 3 defenders to 2 defenders.  Goals went up from 2.54 goals per match (4700 goals in 1848 Football League matches in 1924-25 season) to 3.45 goals per match (6,373 goals in 1848 Football Leagues matches in 1925-26 season).\n\nFor fans and hardcore fans like us who are on soccer subreddit, we don't need more goals to be entertained.  But FIFA want to attract more casuals and none-fans and more youth who are more into tiktok and gaming.  For casual/none-fans, they probably prefer to watch 2-1,2-2,3-2 matches over 0-0,1-0,1-1 matches.  Hardcore fans like us love 0-0, 1-0, 1-1 matches just as much as 2-1,2-2,3-2 matches so this rule change is not targeted for us.\n\nFIFA don't want to rest on its laurel as the most popular sport.  It wants to the sport to be better like it did back in 1925.  FIFA probably want football to be more popular in China where basketball is now more popular than football when it was not the case some 20 years ago.",

In 1972, the rule was changed so that the attacking player was only offside if he or she was beyond the second-last opponent rather than the third last - the same change that football had made in 1925.\n\nBut hockey went further. From 1987, offside only applied inside the 25-yard area. By 1998, it had been dispensed with entirely. It did not mark the death of the game. It improved it.\n\nKate Richardson-Walsh, captain of the Great Britain team that won gold at the 2016 Olympics, grew up playing the sport during the era of offsides. She is just old enough to recall the naysayers, those who said it would not work but eventually accepted that it did.\n\n\"It was hard for some people,\" Richardson-Walsh tells Sky Sports. \"I did not feel the extreme change whereas for people who had been playing a long time it would obviously have been a massive change in terms of tactics, formations, skills and style of play.\n\n\"The game was very confined. There was a need to open the game up and make it faster just to develop the game. It also coincided with the time when hockey started to be played on astroturf instead of grass. That added to the speed element of it. Everything changed.\"\n\nBefore the removal of hockey's offside rule, much of the flow of the game was shaped and influenced by its tactical ramifications just as football is today. It was a seismic shift.\n\n\"Defenders needed to be disciplined to play a high line. They needed to be very mindful of the ball coming through you and over the top a little bit, particularly in the '80s. Those skills, the timing of those runs by the forward off the back of the defender, they just changed.\n\n\"Without offside, you then have more running skills, more dribbling with the ball, more one-on-ones and ball carries. Now you see that big outlet shape, stretching play as much as possible to stretch defences so you can then play either around teams or through teams.\"\n\nAs Van Basten predicts with football, coaches adapted",

Demonstrated in the offside trial in Italy last year.  \n\nSame thing happened in history when IFAB change the offside rule in 1925 that gave attackers huge advantage over defenders.  \n\nIt also led to an increase in goalscoring: 4,700 goals were scored in 1,848 Football League games in 1924\u201325. This number rose to 6,373 goals (from the same number of games) in 1925\u201326.[25]\n\nConjectures can be made on paper.  But real life might be different.\n\nSome people in 1925 probably said the same thing.  \"changing the offside rule from last 3 defenders to last 2 defenders will give striker a big advantage.  But the easier it is for the striker to be onside, the more powerful putting more defenders behind the ball is, therefore two teams will just sitting deep and fuck all happens.\"",

                    "comment": "at least FIFA is doing its due diligence. \n\nLast time when IFAB trial the offside rule (from last 3 defenders to last 2 defenders), the trial was one match.\n\nOn 30 March 1925, the FA arranged a trial match at Highbury where two proposed changes to the offside rules were tested. During the first half, a player could not be offside unless within forty yards of the opponents' goal-line. In the second half, the two-player rule was used.[96]\n\nThe two-player proposal was considered by the FA at its annual meeting on 8 June. Proponents cited the new rule's potential to reduce stoppages, avoid refereeing errors, and improve the spectacle, while opponents complained that it would give \"undue advantage to attackers\"; referees were overwhelmingly opposed to the change. The two-player rule was nevertheless approved by the FA by a large majority.[97] At IFAB's meeting later that month, the two-player rule finally became part of the Laws of the Game.[98]\n\nThe two-player rule was one of the more significant rule changes in the history of the game during the 20th century. It led to an immediate change in the style of play, with the game becoming more stretched, \"short passing giv[ing] way to longer balls\", and the development of the W-M formation.[99] It also led to an increase in goalscoring: 4,700 goals were scored in 1,848 Football League games in 1924\u201325. This number rose to 6,373 goals (from the same number of games) in 1925\u201326.[25]",

All attacking players is \"out of play\" immediately he is in front of the ball and must return behind the ball as soon as possible\n\n- Three players rule (1866) player is offside \"unless there are at least three of his opponents between him and their own goal;\n\n- Two-player rule (1925) The Scottish FA urged the change from a three-player to a two-player offside rule as early as 1893.[79] Such a change was first proposed at a meeting of IFAB in 1894, where it was rejected.  \n\nIt took almost 30 years before that proposal (which pretty much what we have today) was adopted in 1925 after a 1 match trial.\n\n\nThe daylight offside rule that is currently in trial is also a variation of the two-player offside rule.  Attacking player is offside if his whole body which he can score is in front of the defender.",

Attacker just park by the goal and wait for a long pass.  \n\nMotivation\n\nThe motivations for offside rules varied at different times, and were not always clearly stated when the rules were changed.\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of a November 1863 newspaper article in the Sporting Gazette, \"[f]or a player to place himself nearer his opponent's goal than the ball, and to wait for it to be kicked to him, is not anywhere recognised but as being decidedly unfair\".[15] Curry and Dunning suggest that offside play was considered \"highly ungentlemanly\" at some schools; this attitude may have been reflected in the use of terminology such as \"sneaking\" at Eton and \"loiter[ing]\" at Cambridge.[16][17][18]\n\nIn general, offside rules intend to prevent players from \"goal-hanging\"\u2013staying near the opponent's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to them directly. This was considered to be unsportsmanlike and made the game boring. In contrast, the offside rules force players not to get ahead of the ball, and thus favour dribbling the ball and short passes over few long passes.[19]",

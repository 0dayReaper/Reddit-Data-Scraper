Because I can't imagine that we make equally as much as Ajax and more money on business seats than PSV with our ancient facilities.\n\nOne of the reasons our merchandise is so much lower is that Adidas forbids or blocks Feyenoord shirts being sold outside the official fanshops. For example, we can't sell any Gimenez shirts in Mexico even though we have gained a lot of popularity there since Santi arrived.",

Deze stijging is het gevolg het spelen van meer Europese thuiswedstrijden en minder thuiswedstijden met beperkt of zonder publiek als gevolg van COVID-19.\n\nSource: https://acties.feyenoord.nl//media/2209091054%20-%20Jaarverslag%202021-222%20Feyenoord%20Rotterdam%20NV-V9.pdf",

Bij Feyenoord hebben een aantal relatief kleine onbekende bedrijven business units. Ik kan me voorstellen dat je als bedrijf sneller geneigd bent om meer geld uit te geven aan een partnership als je er ook topkwaliteit faciliteiten voor terugkrijgt. Dan kan je je zakenrelaties ook meer bieden dan een koude kroket.",

Daarnaast heeft Ajax ook veel internationale partnerships, die zal je niet zo snel een business seat aanbieden. Partnerships is bij Ajax 2,5x zoveel als bij Feyenoord",

            "comment": "**Ajax has things commercially in excellent shape. The Amsterdam club earns more commercially than PSV and Feyenoord combined. De Telegraaf wrote earlier on Friday about Ajax's commercial successes since 2015, when (2015/16 season) Menno Geelen became commercially responsible.**\n\nAjax Showtime dived deeper into the figures, noting big differences between Ajax on the one hand and the two biggest title rivals PSV and Feyenoord on the other. That Ajax has experienced significant growth in the commercial area since Geelen took over as commercial director is beyond doubt.\n\nIn the 2014/15 season, Ajax earned 22.4 million euros in the area of partnerships, while merchandise revenues were 12.1 million euros. Based on the annual figures for the 2021/22 season, we can see the differences are huge: partnership revenues rose to 39.2 million euros and merchandise revenues increased to 35.5 million euros.\n\nWhen Ajax's commercial revenues are compared with those of PSV and Feyenoord, big differences are visible. When these revenues - where there is a big difference especially on the basis of partnerships and merchandise - are added up, Ajax has more than Feyenoord and PSV combined. In doing so, the Amsterdam club lays a huge foundation for a bigger budget than its two rivals. After all, the higher the commercial revenues, the higher the salaries Ajax can offer its players.\n\nCommercial revenues include ticket sales for national and European matches, business seat sales and income from partnerships, TV fees and merchandise. At Ajax, based on the 2021/22 season, all these revenues added up to 119,541,000 million. At PSV (56,440,000) and Feyenoord (61,948,000) combined, revenues were found to be 118,388,000, showing that commercial revenues at Ajax are higher than at the two title rivals combined. See table below for the overview:\n\n| | Ajax | PSV | Feyenoord | PSV + Feyenoord |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ticket revenue NL | 15,042,000 | 7,972,000 | 9,400,000 | 17,372,000\n| Ticket revenue EU | 7,544,000 | 3,149,000 | 5,992,000 | 9,141,000\n| Business-seats | 11,610,000 | 7,830,000 | 11,600,000 | 19,430,000\n| Partnerships | 39,207,000 | 22,202,000 | 16,000,000 | 38,202,000\n| TV-revenue | 10,594,000 | 9,538,000 | 9,256,000 | 18,794,000\n| Merchandise | 35,544,000 | 5,749,000 | 9,700,000 | 15,449,000\n| **Total** | **119,541,000** | **56,440,000** | **61,948,000** | **118,388,000**\n\n!ping Ajax",

To me that\u2019s different from bringing in Saudi investors and evading FFP regulations. \n\nYou guys getting a lot of tv money: good for you, can\u2019t complain about that as the PL earned it by being the most popular league in the world.",

We wouldn't have had our financial troubles if it wasn't.\n\nAnd whilst we are part of the top three, we've dropped the ball so many times.\n\nReally hoping that our recent management and leadership is turning this ship around and create a Feyenoord dynasty to bring glory to the club, but also help lift the Eredivisie.",

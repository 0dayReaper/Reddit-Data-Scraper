Got to the point that she's completely lost interest in all food no matter what I try to give her and she won't touch milk when I try to give it to her when normally she loved it. The other day I noticed I hadn't seen her in a while and thought she slipped out of the house and found her hiding in the back corner of the guest room closet, where I've never seen her go before, and she keeps going and spending all her time just laying in there. Won't play with anything anymore. Not so long ago she was kicking her one catnip toy around the house and now I brought it to her in the closet and she won't touch it or even sniff it. She just lays there and doesn't play or eat or anything.\n\nI had another cat who started acting similarly before he died and I waited too long to make the call and he wound up dying in pain overnight the day that I was due to take him. I don't want that to happen again so I'm really trying to be proactive but it's hard.",

There is no \"greatest film of all time\", and such label has only given Citizen Kane a lot of unfairly harsh thoughts from many people over the years.\n\nThe cinematography is amazing, the filmmaking is technically impeccable and filled with great shot compositions, but what will you determine if you will actually love the film is how much you connect with Charles Foster Kane's story. I personally find him, and the themes surrounding him, fascinating, but I admit it is not one of the most widely compelling and thrilling at the surface. Citizen Kane has the feel of a documentary even though its story and main character are fictional, its narrative is framed like that, it is a great representative of realism in cinema (and reason why very influential french film critic Andre Bazin revered the movie so much, and Orson Welles' filmography overall). And like any documentary, your enjoyment will heavily depend on how much you are interested in the topics it covers. \n\nI personally was interested in learning more about Charles Foster Kane from the moment of the opening \"News On The March\" segment, the whole opening actually. It's also a film that truly rewards rewatches, a slow-burn. I'll strongly disagree with anyone that says that Citizen Kane is nothing more than cold technical exercise, I was genuinely moved and teary-eyed by a scene towards the ending, but I won't spoil it.",

He just believed that \"if the human eye can see it, I think the camera can capture it as well\".\n\nWhat do you think of this other comment I made on Citizen Kane?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/144zzln/free_talk_friday/jnlegd8/",

If you still have the energy, head out the south entrance of Greenwich park and east to The Point for the best view of London.\n\nFrom there you can walk down to Deptford/Newcross for more pubs or cheap dinners, and get the train back to London Bridge and back to where-ever you're staying.\n\nIf you want to see all the big sights. Start on Trafalgar Square, Walk down the Mall to Buckingham palace, then down Birdcage to Westminster, then up Whitehall back to Trafalgar square. It'll take you an 40 minutes and you'll see Nelson's Column, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Downing Street and Horseguards Parade.\n\nIf the weather is good. Go to the swimming ponds in Hampstead Heath, then go to the Southampton Arms for cheap pints and a roast pork sandwich.\n\nAlso, all the museums and gallerys are free. If its not free, its probably not worth it. tate Modern, tate Britain, National Gallery, Portrait Gallery, British Museum, Imperial War Museum, Design Museum, V&amp;A, Natural History Museum, National Maritime Museum. All will cost you sweet fuck all.\n\nLondon can be really expensive but the best things to do are cheap or free. If you have a contactless credit/debit card use that for transport. It automatically caps at the price of a daily travel card, and is always cheaper than the paper tickets. If you really want to save, use buses. Its \u00a31.70 for an hour of unlimited travel.",

As an advanced island nation imo we should have had a lot less deaths. \n\nNone of this is to say Truss was better. The fact they decided to sub her 2 mins after kick off never to be seen again is telling.",

The only exception I know of that is not from his Tommy Dorsey years (the very early 1940s) is his 1955 recording of the song \"Weep They Will\". At 2:35 of the song, he sings \"Oh, Weep They Will\" in full voice, and then he sings \"Oh, Weep\" softly and in falsetto to really gorgeous effect. I love this whole recording. Supposedly, it is Tony Bennett's favorite Sinatra recording.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/42Jg9Q5PRfo",

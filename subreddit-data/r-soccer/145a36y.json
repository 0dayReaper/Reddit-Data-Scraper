Hasn't provided many assists either. I can't remember any but I'm not supremely confident in that claim. However still, that's almost 6 years (5 because he didn't have us this season).\n\nUp until that 0-4 at the Bernab\u00e9u, Bar\u00e7a hadn't beaten us for 4 seasons IINM. People just don't seem to remember while Bar\u00e7a fans seem to pretend otherwise, which is natural and understandable. I guess for the neutrals, the simple explanation is that our victories aren't as memorable on account of the scorelines.",

As I had mentioned, I was going off on memory but the last defeat I remembered was the Suarez hat trick one, where Lope was sacked.\n\nLet me just attach the list for everyone's reference in fact.\n\n[List of El Cl\u00e1sico matches.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_El_Cl%C3%A1sico_matches)\n\nYou were correct, mostly. 2 and a half season for us. Previous 3 for Bar\u00e7a without loss. I think bias aside, my memory could also have been clouded by those 2 SuperCopa games where we beat them 5-1. The fixture is a glorified friendly (nobody even took notice until Mourinho) Messi also scored for the succeeding 2 Cl\u00e1sicos after the 2-3 but never after that. October 2018. Then didn't score with PSG although his penalty was a very crucial moment. Kylian single handedly made up for it in the dying embers of that game but still, in the larger scheme of things, that penalty was crucial.\n\nIMO it's actually good he has returned to Bar\u00e7a. He's still fabulous but I do think that he would have been detrimental to them sportingly as we seemed for Cristiano after Juventus. I'm just happy to see the back of him.",

I hope for your sake and his sake things work out but there is a reason why a free agent of his stature is signing for you guys to begin with. Keita was supposed to be the guy we built our midfield around for the long term when he joined. I don't think we under Klopp has ever gone to the extreme lengths we did to get this guy at the time. We basically agreed to over pay on his release clause one year earlier and struck a deal with Leipzig. But at Liverpool he was for me the most frustrating player I have witnessed under Klopp. He had such a bizarre injury record. And when he did play his performances were so inconsistent. It was only towards the 2nd half of 2022 that he really started to make his mark at Liverpool and we all thought he would kick on and deliver on his potential this season. But then, it was another injury and then another until he barely played. I would say of all our signings under Klopp, he was the one that disappointed us the most. Sure Ox was also similar in his injury record and availability, but atleast we knew what we were getting when we signed him and he was always looked at as a great squad option with potential, but Keita was supposed to be the heart of our midfield and had such hype surrounding him, but then had such a frustrating career. In a way he reminds me a lot of Daniel Sturridge, another immensely talented player who didn't reach the heights he should have due to fitness...\nAnd that's the biggest threat for you guys with him. If he is barely available and sucking up a big part of your wage bill, then it would end up as a horrible deal and you will find it hard to move him on.",

So even if it somehow doesn't work out at all the whole deal including wages costs more or less the same as any \"average\" Bundesliga player. And he definitely is better than the average Bundesliga player.\n\nThe expectations for Werder are just wildly different than the ones for Liverpool. We're nowhere near international competitions and slowly have to crawl out of the relegation battle the next years.\n\nIn a rough and lacking comparison Werder is on the level of Nottingham or Bournemouth just without any money to spend and just go Keita for free and on lower wages than the top earners of the club. The risk is minimal while the potential is massive.",

                            "comment": "In 2021, Bremen got relegated for the first time in 40 years. They got Markus Anfang as their new coach to lead them to promotion, who had a decent 2nd division campaign with Darmstadt the year prior. Bremen (and Schalke) were the clear favorites for promotion, they could keep most players, and despite struggling to find a footing in the 2nd division, Bremen kept Anfang. \n\nMatchday 14, they are on a disappointing 9th place, with performances to indicate that they won't get near promotion this year. While the focus should be on the game against Schalke, rumor has it that Bremen's coach supposedly bought a fake vaccination card to circumvent the Covid vaccination, which would be bad now but especially November 2021, during the height of the first vaccine rollout and a new Covid wave. Anfang had to step down as manager and Bremen was looking to become the new Hertha/HSV, failing to perform and now total chaos on the management side. \n\nA week later, Bremen announced that their new manager was going to be the 33 year-old Ole Werner. Werner supposedly was their manager of choice when relegated in the summer iirc, back then, he still was with Holstein Kiel, and after a successful season, they couldn't get him, but they had a rough early season and Werner chose to step down himself in September of 2021. What came then was a total turnaround for Bremen, they won 9 out of the next 10 games, 1 draw (making them the most in-form team out of the European top leagues) and, ultimately, the promotion, which had seemed out of reach even before all the chaos ensued with Anfang. This season, they played better than expected, never really in doubt of relegation, and their striker was nominated to play in the World Cup for the German national team for the first time (and was one of the few bright spots).\n\nOh, yeah, and now they've signed Naby Keita who in 2018 was one of Bundesliga's biggest stars (among other things scored 2 against Bremen) and signed for Liverpool for 60 million Euros.",

His injury history + age would have scared a LOT of teams off, i.e. mid-table and above in every league, basically. Dude was happy and at his best when playing in the BuLi, so I'm guessing part of the relatively low wages for a player of his profile is him hoping to rebuild his career a bit.\n\nFantastic player when he could stay healthy consistently, which only really happened for one good stretch while he was at Liverpool. It's a damn shame, too, because he was an exciting signing for us, and I had such high hopes for what he could bring.\n\nHopefully he can get his body sorted out and regain his form with Werder, because skill and raw talent wise, he's class. Just never had the consistency of form with us because of the constant injuries.",

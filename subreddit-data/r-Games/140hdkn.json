Fall of Rome: a compact turn based game where you build a new kingdom in the ashes of the Roman Empire. Every choice matters! \n\nRecently we\u2019ve been upgrading the look of our UI, making it more suited for PC. \n\nWe\u2019ve had over 1800 downloads of our demo, which is available for free on Steam. \n\nWhat\u2019s so cool about our game?\n\n\u2022  The game is accessible, yet complex. There\u2019s a lot of strategy to learn and develop through gameplay\n\u2022  Compact gameplay lets you do all the fun stuff over and over again!\n\u2022  Designed to have a board game feel with a unique style of art and shader magic that I\u2019m calling \u201cliving miniature\u201d \u263a\ufe0f\n\n\nWishlist on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1561960/Yield/)\n\nWe\u2019re super appreciative of every wishlist as it helps with visibility ahead of our release so more people can check out our project! \n\nRelease: 2024",

And it's nearly always before asking me whether I want to continue the previous game or start a new one.\n\nOne bug I noticed early and that is really annoying is that the gold amount you have does not refresh half the time you spend it : \nIf I have 7 gold and build a sheep farm, the gold at the top of the map will still display 7 gold. The game knows I do not have that many anymore (I can not build another 5 gold thing), and going to the research screen will tell me I have only 2 Gold, but this is so frustating.\n\nI also have a question : do the AI play with the same rules as the player ?\nIt seems that sometimes the AI has an enhanced king (or one of the heroes available with stars) after only a few turns (before I can get a star).",

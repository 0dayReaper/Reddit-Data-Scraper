Love the tone/setting of it. \n\nCompulsion is a really cool studio, they were founded by a guy from Arkane and basically had no money to start due to a massive deal falling through but they kept on chugging. They were a small studio who made Contrast and then started work on We Happy Few and that ended up evolving so much during its development from a survival game to a more immersive sim story game. I hated the survival aspect of WHF but the actual story and world building was incredible imo. Now they\u2019ve grown even more after being acquired and they\u2019re getting to make a game without having to worry about size or budgets and can really show off what they\u2019re capable of. So happy for Compulsion, this looks great!",

PlayStation got shit on because there were too many trailers that didn't show the game, specifically first party. Concord, Fairgames, Marathon, etc. As a cheeky \"own\" Xbox made a tweet claiming no CGI trailers, all in-engine/gameplay. But here on their showcase while they're technically showing in-engine footage, it's identical to the PS show that there is no gameplay, or any indication as to how they play. Idk how that's hard to understand for you.",

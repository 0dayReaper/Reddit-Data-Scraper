    "postText": "Let me take 5 minutes out of your day to fill you in on why I'm so fucking pissed.\n\nLike many of you, I started gaming as young as 6 years old. As far as I can recall, my first game ever was Petz Horsez for my bright pink Gameboy Advance SP. As a little girl who was completely new to gaming, this was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. Complete with shitty chiptune music on an 8 second loop and comedically awful sound effects, this game blew my mind despite the fact that it was mind numbingly boring. The seed was planted, this was only the beginning.\n\nFast forward about 3 years. I've played nearly every horse game in the Petz franchise a hundred times over, primarily on the Wii, DS, and DSI. Of course the stories are pointless, the gameplay is repetitive and obnoxious, but I was still happy. It had horses in it. I branched out to some other titles, most of them liscensed by Nintendo, but nothing was exciting me like it had before. Every horse game was a copy of another horse game, which was a copy of another horse game. This happens to be the same year that I actually touched a real horse. I liked it so much, I decided I wanted to give riding lessons a try. My wonderful parents humored me, and I sat on a horse and walked around with her once a week. Consider me enamored at this point, I wanted to do this for the rest of my life! Unfortunately, that's not how budgets work. Back to the handheld ranch. \n\nAt 9 my expectations were still low, but the fog of childhood wonder was beginning to lift. My horse games were boring, unrealistic, sugarcoated, and obnoxiously catered towards little girls that didn't know a damn thing about the equestrian world! With the newfound glory of the internet at my side, I set out on a mission to find it. The ultimate horse game. Wiimote in hand, I scoured the internet. I read every top ten list, bought every 4 star 2 review horse game off of Amazon, braved my local gamestop for any sign of a halfway decent horse game. After years of trials, I only found one horse game that was tolerable as far as progression, realism, and gameplay are concerned... Gallop &amp; Ride for the Wii.\n\nThis was an underwhelming result, but it was something. After playing the game to death, I could say with confidence it was the best game I'd ever played in the genre, but that wasn't a huge achievement. It did some things right. In the game you play as the heir and manager of a sort of dude ranch. Guests come to stay at your inn, ride your horses, and enjoy the scenery. The game introduced some impressive concepts, such as vaccination, strain on your working horses, and a fun points system besides the regular currency. The controls were obnoxious, as every wii horse game demands you hold the Wiimote and nunchuk as if they were reigns, but this beautiful game gave you the option to toggle your riding controls to a basic joystick and A button. Already 10x better. I have reason to believe other competitors in the horse genre thought little girls were too stupid to even navigate to the settings, since no other game had this possibility. Thank you, Gallop &amp; Ride. You didn't suck so much.\n\nHere's why I'm pissed. While Gallop &amp; Ride was one of the most mature equestrian games I've ever played, it's basically a unicorn. As a 19 year old woman who is still shamelessly infatuated with horse games, I cannot find a single game on any console, much less PC, that boasts the same performance. Star Stable? Are you kidding me? Howrse? It doesn't even have gameplay. You know your favorite genre is suffering when the only tolerable way to play it is IN OTHER GENRES. While Horsez did get me started, I thankfully moved on to greener pastures. I discovered Pok\u00e9mon, The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, all the games I love as an adult. I can say with confidence, Breath of the Wild does horse physics and mannerisms better than any specialized horse game. If you google \"horse games\" some of your top results will consist of Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of the Colossus, and Breath of the Wild... My friends, these are obviously not horse games.\n\nI didn't enter the horse gaming world to make friends. I'm here to make champions, bank, and a helluva reputation. I want to see my horses die, I want to break out of this pocket dimension that every horse game seems to be stuck in and watch my estate age as it would in reality. A serious equestrian gamer doesn't have time for projectile hearts and 5 minute long nose rubs, we want gameplay. Where is the strategic breeding? The real world illnesses and dilemmas, the branching careers, the satisfaction of rising to the occasion and being the best goddamn manager and equestrian you can be? Where is the soul? I truly believe this is a game that hasn't been made yet. I can't say with certainty whether there is or isn't an equestrian game demand. Maybe I'm the only one who gives a shit, and I'm destined to be angry about this for the rest of my life. But, should anybody else share in this passion, there is a serious genre to be fulfilled here. I won't lose hope, and as someone interested in game design, I won't abandon my own ideas for what the ultimate horse game should look like, but for god's sake, give the weird horse girls and guys of the world something to look forward to.\n\nThank you.\n\nHere is a link to the presentation that inspired me to raise hell. Please check it out.\n\nhttps://www.themanequest.com/blog/2018/11/28/game-z-festival-talk-about-the-best-horse-game-of-my-childhood-mein-pferdehof\n\nEdit: Another excellent link to The Mane Quest, start here if you're interested in learning more!\n\nhttps://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/2/2/ludicious19-talk-all-horse-games-are-bad-and-heres-why-you-should-care-about-that",

I loved horses growing up, and played a ton of horse games but was deeply frustrated by the pure garbage that was out there.  It was clear the creators wanted to make games for young girls, not about horses. Nothing wrong with games for young girls but I wanted a place to talk to actual adults, and to not waste my life cleaning up virtual poop.\n\nThe focus of my game is a very intense realistic genetics system with gameplay designed for working adults. We have a month-long breeding season, no need to log in every day, your horses don't vanish if you don't log in or anything like that and no little kids. We keep the community very friendly and toss out jerks and immature folks. (I have a 4-year-old, I have enough of that kind of drama in my life already.) The average player age is mid 20s.\n\nFor my horsey credentials, I started riding when I was 9. Owned horses for 20 years.  I competed at state and national levels in horse judging, horse bowl and educational demonstrations while in 4H.\n\nOn the game design side, I have done browser-based games for almost 2 decades (HuntAndJump is 13 years old).  I also am a TTRPG author currently working on King Author Pendragon for Chaosium.\n\n(New account, so you lot can't see all the ~~freaky~~  \"totally normal\" stuff I am into on Reddit! )  \n\n\nETA: If anyone wants to listen to my interview with Ken and Robin it starts at 30:41  \n [https://www.podbean.com/ew/dir-zg2q8-7010f6f](https://www.podbean.com/ew/dir-zg2q8-7010f6f?fbclid=IwAR1wHNcq-COp0Zo3Jmwx4CkecaKi3428WDc8lignVqWRiopBkxMAX71EXbk)",

Farming are missing from this game where you cruise around happily in the tractor. There is zero challenge.\n\nWhere is the hail? Where is the rest of the weather for that matter? Where are the diseases and resistant weeds? How come the combine never seems to eat a rock and the baler never half-ties a bale and jams with rain on the way in 2 hours?\n\nThere is no actual pressure in the game, and the pressure is what puts the sport in farming. It's the most boring game ever...\n\nEdit: it also needs a racing section where you drive the farm truck too fast over muddy roads to buy another hitch pin before the store closes in 10 minutes",

Meanwhile someone has gotten impatient with all the BS and made a run over to the semi with their combine and now is in the way of everyone.\n\nThe terrible thing is that there are people out there who would think this is great fun.\n\nGlad to know it's not just my tractors that have broken AC though",

Every company is too scared to do it but cities skylines shows that you actually can make a lot of money just by having a better game/price than EA. And sims isn't just a game for casuals/little girls etc.   I know so many people that love Sims but don't play it because let's be honest: the game is only fun with a lot of dlc's",

Think incrementally, start with an old-school, spreadsheet UI, then once you have your management loop down, you can attract more people to help you with the riding portion. Or go the other way around, really, building a riding simulator in Unity may actually be a good way to dip your toes into game development.\n\nWe know why most horse games suck. They are made by developers that would rather be doing another game, so there is definitely a comfortable niche for a game made with passion. In the worst case, you'll learn a bit about software development and project management, which will probably be useful in the future no matter what you decide to do.",

The number of consumers that might not necessarily be interested in horses, but are interested in simulators, would only be substantial if the game was actually well-made and offered interesting and fitting mechanics as a horse-related simulator. There's also the matter of whether or not there exists a dev or group of devs that are both passionate about horses and game making. \n\nIf you look at the games that actually have deep and complex horse-riding emulation, animation and texture mapping are extremely complex for the best games. RDR2 features extremely detailed musculature, for which animation dictates when certain parts of a bump-map or shading is shown, to simulate flexing muscles as the horse moves. Animation transitions are a different story as well. \n\nIt's a tall order if you want the best.",

Thank you for posting here /u/emus-with-teeth, because I was not aware this subreddit was such a good target for this topic. \n\nFor years (I'm 27, and have been looking for a good horse game since I was like 9 or something), I have seen this subject go so goddamn unaddressed that last year I finally decided to dedicate a significant portion of my free time to it:\n\n**I am the speaker in the talk you linked at the end of your post, and the creator of [The Mane Quest](https://www.themanequest.com/), a website dedicated to taking horse games and the people who play them seriously**, and I am every bit as pissed of as you, except I have to try and stay polite about it so the developers of horse games will keep talking to me for interviews \ud83d\ude05\n\nHorse game fans exist, they are \"serious\" gamers and they are a completely and utterly untapped market. You and I (as well as the few hundred people in the discord and facebook communities I've started to build) are proof of that, and I dearly dearly hope some day the gaming industry will realize it too. \n\nFor anyone interested in this subject, may I suggest:  \n\n* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuJKGNbLsu0&amp;t=42s) for a simple overview of what's wrong with horse games.  \n* Checking out the [Reviews section on The Mane Quest](https://www.themanequest.com/reviews) to see the kind of shit OP is referring to  \n* joining any of the [horses in games communities](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/11/23/new-facebook-group-join-the-horses-amp-video-games-communities-to-meet-fellow-horse-game-lovers) that I've been starting to build up (among them: /r/GamesWithHorses)  \n* The two game projects that I currently have relatively high hopes for are [Equestrian](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/5/1/horses-are-already-magical-they-dont-need-fairy-dust-interview-with-the-team-of-equestrian-a-horse-game-for-adults) and [Stable Girl](https://www.themanequest.com/blog/2019/12/9/windstorm-studio-announces-new-open-world-horse-riding-adventure) (that last one is a working title). Although I don't expect these to be perfect, I hope they will show that there is a valid market strategy in catering to a more mature (as in non-kids, not nsfw) horse game audience.   \n* For other ways to support TMQ and its quest for better horse games, see [here](https://www.themanequest.com/support).\n\nOP, thank you for bringing attention to this problem and to my work &lt;3\n\nA ton of love to you from a fellow frustrated horse girl gamer \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

They also make fun of some of the quirks and glitches that Roach was infamous for, and it's a pretty subtle and hilarious way of breaking the forth wall with their writing and humor. \n\nPlus you can summon Roach from anywhere, and that lack of that convenience in BOTW was a huge reason why I almost never used horses. Too much of a hassle to deal with for the most part. Roach will even follow a trail automatically so you can just look around and enjoy the scenery, which is a great touch.",

It\u2019s refreshing to see some well-thought out, original content/discussion on this sub rather than people just talking about release dates and sales figures, so kudos for that!\n\nAs for speaking about the actual topic, you bring up some really good points. There are niche games for just about every mundane job imaginable (truck simulator, football manager, etc) and there are tons of other \u201cpet\u201d games like nintendogs, so it seems like there is definitely a market for that.\n\nI think the two biggest issues right now are both about perception: that horseback riding/care/competition is viewed  as a feminine/female dominated interest, and that gaming is still viewed as masculine/male dominated interest. Obviously both are incorrect, but as with anything, if those that control the purse strings don\u2019t *believe* a product will be financially viable (weather it would be successful or not is an entirely different thing)then it\u2019s not gonna get funding.

Even if...All of it is kinda in the context of horse racing.\n\nIf you speak the langauge, perhaps you want to check out games like Winning Post? Latest one is yet to be released, I think.\n\n[https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/winning-post-9-2020-announced-for-ps4-switch-and-pc](https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/winning-post-9-2020-announced-for-ps4-switch-and-pc)\n\nAnd to a much smaller degree, Kairosoft did a horse manager game for Android and iOS named Pocket Stables. I think it's also out for the Switch, but not sure.  \n\n\nEdit ; Winning Post 9 trailer  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV\\_iWVfQUfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eV_iWVfQUfw)",

I\u2019m also a big horse game fan (more on the racing side than the breeding side) and all the best games, or really the only games, that focus on down to earth derby racing are in Japanese these days. There used to be English support for some of the older titles in the Gallop Racer series back during the ps2 era, but these days you\u2019re hard pressed to find anything in English. \n\nI own a copy of Champion Jockey Special on Switch, but being in all Japanese I\u2019m limited to memorizing menu orders and playing challenge races, since everything else requires Japanese to really sink your teeth into. It\u2019s a shame too because Champion Jockey on ps3 *did* have English support. So I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t do it for Special. \n\nIn the end I\u2019m stuck going back to Stakes Winner 1 and 2 on Switch, but that can only take you so far. I\u2019d kill for an English translation of Champion Jockey Special, or an English made arcade style, but still grounded, horse racing game.",

            "comment": "I love this post. I've been a gamer for 40 years, and my sister has been a rider for exactly the same length of time. I can tell you why there are no deep, 'proper' horse games: People who love horses generally end up riding them, and if you are a rider you just don't have time for anything else. You work to pay for riding, you go without any kind of luxuries or other hobbies because riding costs horrendous amounts of money. And you spend every spare moment with your horses, either riding them or cleaning up after them. I can't think of anyone I know who rides seriously who has any interest or time for gaming.\n\nHowever, it does seem that there is this huge untapped market: Millions of people would \\*love\\* to ride but can't afford either the time or money to do it. The vast majority of young kids who love horses end up forgetting about that completely as they become adults and have to face the realities of earning money and paying for the basics of living.\n\nWouldn't all \\*these\\* people be a market for a 'real' horse-riding/owning/breeding game? Maybe.\n\nBut you are going to have to make it. I don't think anyone else is going to do it for you. If anyone else decides to make a 'serious' horse game, it won't be the one \\*you\\* want to play. It's really up to you. But I believe the payoff could be pretty spectacular if you got it right, because of all those people I mentioned who would love to be 'horsey people' if they could afford it.",

I was ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED with horse games as a kid and have been craving for a somewhat decent horse game my whole life. I also agree Gallop &amp; Ride was one of the only decent ones, and I also found the settings change as well and it made me love it even more! Another one I kinda liked was Petz Horsez 2, but waving around my arms like a maniac just so the horse will veer left every so slightly would always piss me off.\n\nSome of the ones I played were also all the Petz Horsez iterations, Gallop &amp; Ride, My Horse and Me (1+2), Barbie Horse Adventures, Time to Ride: Saddles and Stables, Saddle Up: Time to Ride, Champion Dreams: First to Ride, May King's Riding Star, and so many more.\n\nA couple I remember really slapped were Pippa Funnell: Take the Reins, and Lucinda Green's Equestrian Challenge. There was another PC horse racing one I got one Christmas that was amazing but I have never been able to find it online since. It had a breeding function and you could focus one stamina, speed, and other skills like leaving the gate quickly and stuff and slowly over the course of several generations make a great race horse line. It was like early 2000s so probably looks shitty now, but in my kid memory it's as hi-res as Red Dead Redemption 2. God that game was fun, wish I could find it.\n\nHorse games were my life blood. Like the success of Christmas every year was whether I got a horse game or not. I'm glad more people out there still care about this poor, poor genre in 2020 haha.\n\nI complained about inadequate video game ponies in modern games in a zine not too long ago if you wanna check it out haha, it can be downloaded here [https://game-query.itch.io/game-query-issue-1](https://game-query.itch.io/game-query-issue-1).",

There were some moments in the run cycle where I was like \"Woah, that doesn't bend that way\", but weirdly enough, it worked. You have to maintain the fun factor for a galloping horse, even if it means sacrificing some realism. Don't quote me on this, but I believe Agro's run cycle was procedurally generated and had its own REAL physics vs. just having a predetermined run cycle animation. That is innovative, and I would love to learn more.",

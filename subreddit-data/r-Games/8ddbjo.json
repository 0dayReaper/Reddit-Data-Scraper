The news is staying up as on-topic for this sub.  To clarify further: this is a human being dying of cancer, and discussion about cancer and other non-gaming topics _in this thread_ are on-topic _in this thread_.  Reports on those comments will be ignored.\n\nHave some empathy.  Please treat the subject with the respect is deserves.",

He was a fan, and implored people to help us out, buy our games, and wrote to me personally saying he was not okay at all with us struggling.\n\nI felt like I was drowning at the time, and this random act of kindness by someone who was at the time a complete stranger to me meant so incredibly much. He and I talked a few times over the years since, but in general not much. Mainly because I think he just has always been a consummate professional and didn't want to taint any reviews he did for my future stuff. That earned him even more respect in my book.\n\nHe's good people. Just through and through, he's a consumer advocate, but not the warmongering kind. He just genuinely wants companies and people to be the best versions of themselves, and calls them out when they aren't.",

I came across his Blue Plz (I believe that was the name) show early on in the WoW days at a time where I was hanging out with friends and guildies that were all relentless enthusiastic and upbeat about the game and the way Blizzard was doing everything. Then I hear this guy being super critical of so many things in the game, to the point where I'm thinking \"Why does he play if he hates it so much?\"\n\nBut I soon realized that he was being harsh on the game because he cared about it deeply and wanted it to be better. I had seen critical opinions being given before, but he really stood out as someone who could be harshly critical yet constructive with his feedback and thoughts on a game that was generally considered nothing but incredible and amazing by everyone I knew.\n\nI don't follow his current content too closely but he's definitely an internet personality that has stuck with me for a long time and made a lasting impression on me. I hope he can find success with this clinical trial he's going to undertake, and I hope he makes a full recovery soon - for his and his family's sake.",

Most of these trials never become drugs and if they do there is a reason they are not approved yet. Also, by the time you try this you are close to dying. Clinical trials can also kill the patient. Since the science is not fully worked out. \n\nThe good news is that over the last decade there have been a small number if successes in clinical trials for cancers where people have gone into remission. The success has been for specific cancers. I wish him the best of luck.\n\nIf you are interested in what it is like for someone dying of cancer I recommend reading Jay Lakes blog.

It was his outlet to the world. \n\nhttp://www.jlake.com/blog/\n\n\nOne advantage he has is the Brittish national health system.

Last I'd heard, he'd been doing really well with his chemo and the cancer had shrunk and was more managable, and his prognosis was looking better. Wishing him and his family the best, he's been fighting this for a long time now and it doesn't look like it's letting up.. but here's to hoping he can keep fighting it.",

Every person who has lost someone to cancer, and everyone who has survived it, and all of the people who watched that fight- all of us have her back and stand with her. She's fighting one of the hardest battles put to a person, and she has our respect and awe. I saw my friend at his weakest, and also when he was stronger than anyone I've ever known. It's been years but still, I'm crying. Cancer is personal. Once it touches you, and you see the enemy, you see how everyone is fighting **your** enemy. I'm grateful to her. We'll be cheering when the bell rings for her- all of us.  Fuck cancer.\n\nOnce cancer becomes a personal issue, you feel it forever.  Every person fighting cancer is a chance at revenge, at taking one soul away from the disease, and stealing a few more years from the hourglass.  I want them to beat cancer.  Do it for you, do it for me- do it for the ones we lost already.  We're all trying to beat and beat up cancer, because it's the fucking worst.  I want to see TB live for his sake, and also so that I can see Vijay's smile one more time, on another face.  \n\nEven if none of his weapons work and the cancer wins -and in the end, we're all in the same race to die happy before the cancer can take us- we'll keep fighting and keep trying to claw back days and months from the tumors.  For him and for everyone.  Fuck, my eyes.  \n\nI'll always be there for anyone with cancer, because I owe it to them.  They were forced into *my* fight.  They were conscripted and sent against the most evil, insidious force on earth, with no warning.  Cancer tore apart Vijay's mind and body.  It's merciless.  I hate it.  ",

It has no concept of the damage done, or why it has to stop. I can't personify cancer because it's not a separate organism - part of what makes it so hard to treat. \n\nI survived it once, but I can't hate it, to do so would be to hate my own broken body. Now I just work where it counts, and provide tests that diagnose and stage those like me. I don't know if it helps, but it helps me. I think. \n\nGood luck to TB, I hope science is on his side. ",

TotalBiscuit most likely will not survive; I do hope his last days are not as painful as some other ones I've seen.\n\nThis is why it is absolutely imperative to get regular cancer screenings, if cancer can be caught early enough, than the survivability rate is much higher, and there is far lower risk that the cancer has spread through the bloodstream to other parts of the body.",

I've worked in both businesses and hospitals and believe me, if there's two things that can turn people irrational very quickly, it's money and health.  If either of those are at risk, all of a sudden the world is against you, and the organisation/person is either completely incompetent or trying to screw you over.  In the vast majority of cases, either the customer is completely in the wrong or it's just a messy situation in which no-one is immediately at fault.  \n\nHowever, occasionally the organisation is very at fault.  Doctors and health professionals do make mistakes, and it's unfortunate that sometimes those mistakes can lead to something very serious.

Like what the actual experience is like, is there game affecting bugs, do game mechanics work as intended and so on and so forth. To me he started new era of deciding of the actual experience is game worth it or not with often spot on critique. Used to read magazines to help making decisions... not so much after finding out there's whole new world in tube I didn't know about. Also got to love him for his sarcastic/ironic/cynical approach, which isn\u2019t that common. May have been a blessing and curse in this politically correct era\u2026\n\n\nHope he makes it, all the best to his struggle.\n",

She was hospitalized so many times, back pain all the time, pain meds barely making it manageable, and then getting pneumonia which ultimately was the cause of her passing from having no immune system. \n\nCancer sucks, My younger brother passed from it, my grandpa had it and recovered, my grandma had it once, and got it again a month ago. It sucks. So much. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, especially after seeing my mother go through it 4 times. The treatments to fight it make you worse, but it's all we have right now to fight back.\n\nI really hope he pulls through, not because I enjoy him and everything he has done(I do), but because no one deserves to suffer like this.",

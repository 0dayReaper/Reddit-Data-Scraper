I was just wandering around this mansion looking for these things for like 15 20 minutes. I was like \u2018I don\u2019t know where this is\u2019 I like this\u201d \u201cI really enjoyed playing this game single player\u201d \u201cthe world was cozy. It was so nice roaming around. Combat was cool. Any time you\u2019d fight a vamp, Brad, it was just so intense.\u201d \u201cI am pleased. I\u2019m still very hyped on this game.\u201d \u201cThe combat itself was really fun cuz it was so, like, visceral\u201d \u201cThe exploration seems really good\u201d \u201cthe world and environments, just looking at it, looks really cool\u201d \u201cThe side quests seemed interesting too\u201d\n\nThey had a few negative things to say as well and it would be disingenuous of me not to mention them.\n\n\u201cThe guns all kind of sound the same\u201d \u201cthere was no stealth kill, which I was really bummed on\u201d \u201cArkane AI during combat [\u2026] weird disconnect [\u2026] lifelessly run at you\u201d This one was immediately followed by assurances that they had time to fix it. \u201cThere was a little too much loot for me\u201d \u201cNo lock pick mini game which is kind of weird. Just hold X\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, he brought up how the character select screen selected the wrong character on accident and he expressed worry as to how the loot system would ultimately be implemented since that is something that many games get wrong. The guy\u2019s tone throughout the overwhelming majority of the video is one of great enthusiasm for the game.",

In the books, they're almost always freakishly tall compared to Earthers, and have strange proportions due to the effects of growing up in low-to-no gravity. They have to take bone-growth medicine and exercise consistently to avoid having their bodies crumble in even the low-G spin gravity they have on stations. The TV show is amazing, but belters are supposed to look extremely different as to how they're portrayed. They're supposed to be so lanky and tall and their bodies so used to low gravity that a significant majority of them would die in Earth-like gravity.",

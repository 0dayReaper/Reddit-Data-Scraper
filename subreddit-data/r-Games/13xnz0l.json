See [part one of my Expanse coverage](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-a-telltale-series-is-a-love-letter-to-fans-of-the-franchise/1100-6514442/) for more info on the preview event, the game, and the folks behind it. Suffice it to say that fans of both the show/books and the genre itself are unlikely to be disappointed by Telltale and Deck Nine's latest offering. Very similar to Alien: Isolation in terms of nailing the overall vibe of the show.",

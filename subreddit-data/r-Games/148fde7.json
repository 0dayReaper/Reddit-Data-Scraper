Fallout 4 was a noticeable step-up over 3 and New Vegas, and that makes sense since Todd said that Id *did* give them some pointers for that game's combat. So while they didn't specifically help with Starfield's combat, they have improved due to help from them still.",

It's a damn shame that Bethesda was so impatient with 76's release. If they had held it off a few years, it would have been much, much better received. Two years after its launch, it had received so much content and patches that it was barely recognizable compared to its launch state.\n\nPart of me really wonders if MS had been showing interest in purchasing Bethesda around the time of 76's release, and Bethesda wanted to push out a GaaS game to try to inflate their value during negotiations.",

Zenimax had been having consistent cash flow problems and was seeking to get acquired. In order to make the company more appealing (and thus get the owners a better price) they pushed live service games at most of their subsidiaries ahead of any sale, regardless of if they had any experience in that kind of game, resulting in things like FO76, Wolfenstein Youngblood, and Redfall.",

So it's not like it's just out of a spirit of co operation across the industry. But it's still nice to see, of course. Especially since there was also word that QA across Microsoft were pitching in with Starfield. It's basically all hands on deck for this flagship title which is exciting",

The major part is Starfield is getting assistance from Xbox *engineers*. \n\n\"From a development side, I like the ability to focus and have help from them, the top engineers at Xbox, to say we're gonna make this look incredible on the new systems. From my standpoint, that's just awesome\" - From Todd Howards interview with [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9AAnV59ddE)",

Rebel good. \n\nBut have a think about it. Is that really the case? \n\nTruly immerse yourself into it. You wake up to a strange new world, you\u2019re told by your saviour that the ruling govt is evil. \n\nWhen you first head into town, you find out your saviour is a wanted terrorist. \n\nWould you as a rational person continue siding with them? \n\nThen let\u2019s look at your options. While doing your quests you end up killing a lot of corpo troopers. \n\nWho are these troopers tho? Are they evil? No. They are not. They are simply working class stiffs. So how can you justify the mass murder and mayhem welles has you commit? Sure, a lot of them seem selfish.. but is that reason enough to execute the lot of them? \n\nNext. What guarantee do you have that Welles will save the colony. By his own admission, you were a fluke. Everyone before you died. Is it a smart bet to place all your hopes on him and disrupt the boards research? \n\nOk. Now look at the board. They are actively researching into the problem. But their stop gap solution is to freeze people first while they slowly find a solution. Logistically, this is significantly less risky than Welles plan to unfreeze everyone and hope to find great minds who can fix the problems, since unfreezing everyone would place massive burden on an already strained colony. \n\nWith the gift of plot armor, we know welles will succeed. But if we are actually immersed into role play, it really isn\u2019t obvious at all. \n\nWhat about Akande? She seems fucking mental doesn\u2019t she? Ordering an entire town to be wiped off the map just to \u201ccut losses\u201d. But she, like Welles believes she\u2019s doing the right thing. She believes firmly that the only hope for the colony is via the board. She is well intentioned but comes off with really bad actions. In the best possible ending for the game, she actually donates her wealth to help fund welles. (You need to pass several skill checks thru out the game) so she\u2019s not flat out evil either. \n\nWhat about Chatrand? She also means well but ends up fucking over her colleagues. \n\nA good majority of folks will also choose to let Adelaide rule over Edgewater and have Reed sacrifice himself. But in the ending cutscenes, this is actually bad for Edgewater. Between the two leaders, there\u2019s absolutely no difference to the development of the towns nutrition despite Adelaide\u2019s green fingers. On the other hand, once in power she will oust several people out of the town to their demise. Whereas if you leave Reed in charge, the town survives AND he introduced the concept of a weekend for the townsfolk to have some rest instead of constantly working. This is a systemic issue caused by the good intentions of most players as they seek to fix the towns nutrition problem and it\u2019s only across different playthrus with different choices that we come to realise our good intentions ended up harming the people instead. \n\nSo there is actually depth to the game. But it\u2019s deep to the point that most players don\u2019t uncover it and think it shallow.",

Despite the nuance in some the quests it ultimately boils down to board = bad ending and Welles = good ending. \n\nThe first planet actually has the best option requiring you to convince the deserters to go back to town and keep working the factory. And it makes everything better. Productivity shoots up and the board rewards them with more supplies and medicine. So I decided based on that first quest line that maybe the board is a necessary evil for the colonies. So I sided with them.\n\nLike you said the game was full of nuance and plenty of moral greyness. But then I chose the board at the end and the game basically went \u201coh you expected more nuance? Sucks to suck, you chose the greedy billionaires so now every one dies. The end\u201d",

Each pairing has different banter with each other and they also occasionally have unique quest interactions. The game doesn\u2019t tell you so you won\u2019t know until you travel around with different companions thru different playthrus. For this reason, I highly recommend supernova difficulty. It makes the game feel a lot more \u201ccomplete\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. The game definitely could use more detail and fleshing out, just pointing out that it isn\u2019t as barren as what most folks believe. \n\nNext, regarding suicidal npcs, it\u2019s actually in line with them being marauders and being high on adrenatime/having their brains reduced to mush.

It obviously pales in comparison to what Bethesda is able to do, but that's a compliment to Bethesda, not necessarily a knock on Outer Worlds. \n\nThis is exactly why no one else makes games like this. Even a game like Outer Worlds is a huge, incredibly complex undertaking. But when compared to Bethesda, the response from consumers is \"meh.\" It's really difficult to overstate how incredible Bethesda is at what they do. The fact is that anyone else trying to do even a fraction of it *is* being ambitious.",

            "comment": "It makes sense... Obsidian has always been more about linear paths, about specific narratives that take you from a place to another. \n\nNew Vegas showed that fully. The narratives were great, but the open world was bland and empty. It really felt like a linear game plopped into an open world. Hell, the opening part of the game (until Boulder City) really railroads the player in a single direction, including the geography of the map.\n\nA semi-open, semi-linear game... something more hub-based... it's really more suitable for Obsidian. It allows them to focus on the depth.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it will be enough. Outer Worlds didn't have exactly much depth and the writing was all over the place. We can hope that that was a fluke... but it can also be a symptom of Obsidian losing their touch.\n\nAnd the trailer didn't help. Nothing about it felt special. Even the teased story felt like a generic \"a gifted chosen one has become an outcast because of their gift\".",

Then you leave with the macguffin to the next planet.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game is how predictable the structure got after the first planet. That's going to be really hard to judge before Avowed releases.",

Multiple planets are Faction A vs Faction B, with some kind of golden option that will satisfy both hidden behind exploration.  I hated that.  I would have preferred if golden options required different skill checks of increasing difficulty, so that no one character could please everyone (unless you built your character *specifically to do that* for your third or fourth play through).\n\nIt killed the replayability.  The only reason to go back for another play through was if you wanted to see factions lose.  The strength of New Vegas' plot structure was that *you couldn't please everyone.*  Someone had to win, and someone had to lose, no matter what.  It made you want to go back and see what the other endings were like.",

You can immediately go in directions that the game tells you not to go and you\u2019ll be fine. Instead of going from Goodsprings to Primm, you can turn right around and go into Red Rock Canyon if you make it past the Cazadores which is completely possible. You can find a Vault and Sloan immediately.\n\nAnd tons of quests branch out, relate to other quests, or start at the locations of other quests. \n\nI do agree that NV Vanilla is a bit lacking in the world/visual storytelling that Bethesda really excels at (they have a real thing for notes and bones telling stories), but NV does a much better job of that in the DLCs so Obsidian is fully capable.",

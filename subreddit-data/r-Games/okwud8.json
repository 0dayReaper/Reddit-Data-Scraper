Can use it as a very good regular touch pad, combine it to enable other buttons/gyro, 1:1 map to the screen (i.e. touch top left of pad is like touching top left of screen), have it bring up menu or instant activate a button split into 4/8/16 sections (and have new sections if button is pressed) etc.\n\nThe Steam Controller really has amazing versatility, the problem is the ballache of setting it up per game or adapting to popular setups every time. Even using it like an Xbox controller and just adding a couple minor quality of life tweaks was useful though (which I imagine will be most common with this Steam Deck).\n\nEDIT: They claim 55% less latency than controller touchpads but they were already instantaneous to me.",

In all honesty, no one probably knows, because a lot of things sell for a \"loss\" for book keeping purposes and none of us are accountants for billion dollar companies.\n\nThere's a recent example with [Xbox](https://www.businessinsider.com/xbox-consoles-not-profitable-microsoft-says-2021-5) saying its consoles have never made money.\n\nThen there is the PS4 which started making a profit soon after [release](https://www.cnbc.com/2013/11/19/sony-close-to-making-a-profit-on-playstation-4.html), but the PS3 reportedly did take nearly its whole lifespan to make a profit. Likewise the Switch turned a profit from day one, as have most Nintendo systems.\n\nAll three of those console makers you almost have to take with a grain of salt though. Particularly Xbox. They're backed by Microsoft - one of the largest companies to ever exist. Hard to think every Xbox has sold for a loss while the competition has sold for profit. Either way though, they all exist to get customers into their ecosystems and then start making some serious cash. \n\nMy two cents: buying something for $400 that should be sold at $600 according to the company makes a consumer feel like the company is cutting them a deal.",

I've always thought that a PC capable of the same would run you *at least* $400, let alone a PC that you can take on the go. \n\nSo, like...can this act like a replacement to an entry-level gaming PC? I've been dying to just ditch my Xbox this generation to make the jump to PC, but the pandemic/crypto/scalping fiasco has driven the price of parts outside my budget. But $500 for this plus a dock is *definitely* in my budget.",

That\u2019s the killer feature that Steam Machines needed if they were going to be successful.\n\nAlthough, let\u2019s face it: it was quite clear from the get-go that Steam Machines were purely intended to be ammo in the fight between Microsoft and Valve, as they launched right after the whole Windows RT debacle where it looked like Microsoft was trying to vie for a store monopoly on Windows and Valve wanted to prove that they didn\u2019t need Microsoft but Microsoft sure as hell needed them. (After all, Gabe Newell first became well-known when he, while still working at Microsoft, proposed that he and a small team port Doom from DOS to Windows on id\u2019s behalf, free of charge, to prove the viability of Microsoft\u2019s new OS as a gaming platform, which he did and proved to be an incredibly good decision on Microsoft\u2019s part as it finally let Windows make in-roads in the consumer market that was still stuck on DOS at that time.) On that front, the Steam Machines were a huge success, and Microsoft hasn\u2019t tried locking down the Windows platform in that fashion ever again.",

Hell on linux, driver updates are super streamlined, and memory usage doesn't change to such a degree, plus it doesn't do anything in the background.",

Now Valve comes out with this and the cheapest model is $50 more than the OLED Switch but offers actual PC games in a similar experience AND has a dock to play on the TV just like the Switch.",

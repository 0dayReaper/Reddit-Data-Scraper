Maybe they just don't want spoilers... but maybe is something like not letting that cloud people's judgment.\n\nI guess that was something they agreed with all the teams beforehand, because it sounds like it took some convincing and they all thought it was a bit of a crazy idea to mix all these different people with different creative processes. So it was also maybe to protect them if it didn't worked... they would leave and no one would know and it wouldn't hurt their reputation.",

Their solution was as dead simple as it was effective: take those bright gradients in the UI and turn them all into dark outlines to make everything very obviously contrasting.",

The patent is less personalized settings, which implies user control, and more the game making changes based on the players interactions with the world to adjust color blind settings on the fly with no additional user input. The article doesn't include an example but I would think a tutorial section would have a bunch of items in different colours and based on order or time to pick up it makes adjustments to future items to make them stand out more.",

The usual \"let's recolor the whole game based on filters\" should not be the standard since that is not how we see the world. The easiest and most flexible solution is to allow players to assign colors themselves to things. This way it is specific to the user and it won't recolor the whole game. You can also go beyond and let players assign different shapes to UI that breaks the color and makes it easy to recognize with glance. This is helpful for normal people too and better customization is always a win.",

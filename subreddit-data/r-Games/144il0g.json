To clarify a few things:\n\n* This is an FPS roguelite\n* It is made by folks who did both Painkiller and The Vanishing of Ethan Carter\n* You don't get locked into arenas (at least not according to a recent dev diary)\n* Yes, Destiny gunplay (of hand cannons in particular) was mentioned as a major influence\n* Similarly, the lore/worldbuilding of Dark Souls has been referenced a bunch\n* There is only a single difficulty setting; it's tailored around that \n\nI can't wait for this game.",

The way the camera subtly zooms and narrows in when you aim down sights and the snappy nature in which it happens. The way enemies flinch and recoil when struck by your shots and explode in a very satisfying way when you land a headshot. All the different audio cues and feedback from reloading, zooming, running out of ammo, and even the way it sounds hitting and killing enemies. The seamless transitions from 1st person to 3rd person and back again as you use certain weapons or your powerful abilities. The way the game conveys your sense and weight of movement as you run and jump around the environment. Even things like your screen having a slight shaking effect when you fire heavy weapons or your camera slightly flinching when you take damage. \n\nIt's all of these things and so much more. It's all about the tiny little details you never really notice but when they all combine it's magic at engaging you. Obviously Bungie isn't the only developer capable of making a good ass feeling FPS game but damn if they haven't been in the zone for over 2 decades now (at least in terms of feel).",

The most hit reaction you'll get is that enemies will stumble before exploding into glitter. \n\nThey have some of the most interesting art direction in mainstream gaming, but Destiny shooting doesn't feel good worth shit and I'll never understand the popular sentiment that it's incredible; it's about the most unattractive way you could describe your 'gunfeel' to me -- gives me immense pause.\n\nI'll take a BLACK, Brutal Doom, F.E.A.R. 1, Titanfall 2 over Destiny any day of the week.",

We'll see which pile this one ends up on.",

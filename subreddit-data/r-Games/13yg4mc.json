Every FF14 expansion has had a different take on the classic prelude, which also manage to stand out from those present in other FF games. To say nothing of the dozens of other tracks in the game that he manages to make several unique renditions of.\n\nThe Heavensward prelude is probably the most well regarded, though I have an appreciation for the muted cello melody in the Shadowbringers prelude that is overshadowed by its bombastic intro.",

He's got a wonderful style in capturing tiny nuances and using motifs, both new and old, but makes them feel so unique every time. The music of FF16 is what I'm most excited for. Gonna be playing with headphones and BGM on max.",

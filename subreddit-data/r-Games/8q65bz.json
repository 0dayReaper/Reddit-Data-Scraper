Considering that prices of consoles are dropping even further and that the manufcaturing processes are still about a year off where they need to be for the new transistor density requirements for new chips, we're probably going to be entering Gen 9 by late 2020, or Summer 2021 if there are delays in getting the costs down for memory and general materials (which right now seems quite likely).",

Morrowind was an incredibly imaginative and evocative game, but the ES games since then have all felt a lot less distinctive.  Even Online was frustratingly hesitant to include elements that didn't either appear in previous games or are standard fantasy tropes.\n\nWith Highrock, I kind of feel like it's a setting I've already explored in other games- just a lot of ordinary medieval castles and villages.  If Bethesda was willing to take a risk on a setting like Black Marsh or Elsweyr- a glowing jungle with sentient trees and Aztec-inspired cities or a mix of desert and rainforest with a cat people and a sort of Persian/Indian-inspired culture- those would be settings I'd be really be excited to explore.",

So I figured they'd do Somerset Isle or Valenwood, which would both be at least somewhat different than usual fantasy RPGs. But High Rock just seems like the least interesting choice, since they already set a game there and it's the most similar to the province they did last time.",

Morrowind would have giant mushrooms and would be more ...ashy given it's 4th era predicament. So both of those are unlikely on the outset. Hammerfell was largely explored in ESO and doesnt have coastal scrublands. It just goes straight to desert. Doesn't mean it's not Hammerfell, just less likely. Still could be and if I were a betting person, I would bet on Hammerfell because the next 2 ideas are straight fucked. Akavir or Yokuda. Yokuda sank unbto the sea in the first Era. So an unlikely candidate. We've always wanted to go to Akavir and it still has relevance unlike places like Yokuda, Pyandonea, or Atmora. Interactions between Tamriel and Akavir were going on in the 2nd and 3rd era. \n\nOne more thing I'm noticing. Morrowind's title was written in gold. Oblivion's was written in Oblivion gate rock. Skyrim's was written in steel. This title looks not like brass, but maybe bronze or more like aged and pitted iron. Don't know if that implies anything yet or not. ",

ESO has touched every major province (Reaper's March and Khenarti's Roost for Elsweyr, Summerset has been fully covered, Morrowind has pretty big chunks, Eastern Skyrim, all of High Rock and Valenwood, a large chunk of Hammerfell, most of Cyrodiil and Shadowfen for Black Marsh) so wherever they go it's not gonna be 100% new if you've played ESO.\n\nHigh Rock hasn't been covered in a modern ES game except for ESO and it seems like a good possibility. It's a mountainous region mostly populated by humans and pretty tame compared to most others which would mean it would be easy to do. Morrowind was the last game where Bethesda went for a more alien province so setting it on a tame one again seems like a very real possibility. Hammerfell could have some regions like that near Hew's Bane, we have only explored about half of it.\n\nAkavir is by far the most alien area they could bring the game into so I don't see them doing it, specially with how they set up a second Great War in Skyrim.\n\nThe crater could place it in Azra's Crossing, which straddles the border between Hammerfell and High Rock. It's pretty much a toss up between the two.\n\nOr they could throw a curveball and go for something completely out there like Pyandonea, but like Akavir it would be such a stretch and so alien that I don't see it being possible, specially since the races players are used to wouldn't be around.",

None of the Elder Scrolls games have been in a similar timeline as any other one. \nAside from history and lore they really don't touch on eachother. I'd personally love if they did Akavir, or Black Marsh &amp; Elswyr as they'd be by far the most interesting. ",

I could see it as more of a buzz word as starfield would be designed for the Xbox X and PS4 Pro, and then TES6 would be a true next gen release with the PS5 as what would be a launch title or a year 2 title.\n\nMy main thing is that i understand teasing TES6, its a huge fan base and everything. But why would you announce a NEW IP that has, by definition, no fan base? The only thing that makes sense is if you want hype before it releases obviously and hype doesn't last 4 years. I think you see starfield sooner rather than later, I think you see starfield gameplay at E3 2019 with a release date in spring 2020 at the latest  and then you see a shift in the culture of Bethesda as they start to get ready for the release of TES6 1-2 years after Starfield.\n\nIts weird to think that PS4 and Xbox One will not have a console specific Elder Scrolls Game",

If not then you'd also have to accept that cryengine is 16 years old, id tech is 25 years old, and frostbite is 10 years old.",

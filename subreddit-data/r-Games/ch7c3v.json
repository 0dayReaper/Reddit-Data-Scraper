A decade ago gamers were up in arms over click bait and sensationalistic gaming \u201cjournalism\u201d. The stuff that simply was written to tap into the latest outrage, or flame the console wars, or was just blatant speculation passed off as fact. Today we have cut out the middle man and run with those stories ourselves. In short we\u2019ve become what we claimed to hate.\n\nA great current example is the epic game store. It\u2019s a lightning rod and has many shortcomings, but the number of submissions that are proven patently false and still receive thousands of upvotes and comments ( hi /r/pcgaming ) is absurd. They will be corrected a day or less later, and nobody bats an eye.\n\nThe danger is people will run with these falsehoods as fact and perpetuate them doing us all a great disservice.\n\nI\u2019m not sure of the fix, but it is definitely a problem from my view. I am skeptical of every claim that doesn\u2019t have solid proof, or hasn\u2019t been recreated by more than one person.",

They will be ridiculed here as clickbait, contrarian trash. Some people will take it too seriously and send them death threats. We have reached peak hype.\n\nThere will be a few redditors with mild complaints, who will be immediately downvoted to invisibility. They will be called nitpickers with unrealistic expectations that probably haven't even played the game.\n\nHype will continue at a high, but slightly declining level for about 2-3 months. More people will have some complaints about the game, and Reddit will be more receptive to their opinions.\n\n\nThen as the next big thing starts gaining hype, people will stop talking about Cyberpunk for a while. That's when the flip happens. Around 4-6 months after release, there will start to be a rising number of \"DAE feel Cyberpunk 2077 didn't live up to it's promise?\" posts. \n\nOld critiques once dismissed as overblown nitpicks are now embraced and magnified as the popular consensus.

It happens every time there is a big-budget open world game set in an urban environment. Developers will talk about how making explorable environments and trying to fill the game with side content is important, then fans will take that concept and take it past the point of parody. \n\nPeople don't realize that when developers give interviews about their games, they are treating it as marketing. Their agenda isn't to fully inform consumers about the true state of the project, it's to build hype and increase sales. \n\nNo one is going to sit down with an interviewer and talk about how they have been trying to get the enemy AI to work correctly for six months, and if they can't make progress soon, they'll have to ship the game with enemies that stand still in the middle of a room and shoot directly at the player. No, they are going to highlight the game's strengths with as much embellishment as they feel comfortable with (some present a pretty realistic expectation of the final product, then there are the Peter Molyneuxs and Sean Murrays that... don't). \n\nThen fans take these best-case-scenarios presented by the developers, take it at face value, and let their imaginations run wild. \n\nI remember when GTA III was in development, one of the prominent members of the dev team talked about how they wanted the police to have the best AIs possible to react to the player's actions and make crimes have consequences. Here in the light of day, almost 20 years after the fact, we can see he was talking about things like police pursuit, but message boards went crazy with their expectations back then. There were months of people theorizing that you could murder an NPC and police would have pieced together evidence to discover it was you that murdered them, and that you would have to change up your behavior to avoid having detectives figure out your identity, among other outlandish expectations.\n\nThis sort of stuff has been going on for as long as video games have existed, but the upvote/downvote system of Reddit makes it so the more unrealistically optimistic voices get magnified for telling people what they want to hear, while the voices of pessimism, or even realism, get buried for being \"downers\". Then the hype feedback loop intensifies.",

Technically, the situation you mentioned is possible, but this is all about the choices made by the player.\"\n\nThis is in response, from what I understand, to someone asking if there would be the ability to find yourself in a church and start shooting up the place.\n\nNow, the cynic in me says that they will restrict the ability to do that because you are restricted in some game from being able to hurt certain protected individuals (kids, etc.).  This comes up when interest groups get involved in the appearance of the game as a source for people to \"act out their fantasies\" or whatever.  If you release a game that allows you to go into a school and murder all the kids, you become the game that allows you to train kids to do school shootings.  I think we're all adult enough here to know that's not necessarily the case, but if they allow people to find themselves inside a church, with a gun, whether by direction of the game or by incidental cause (the AI retreated to the building, while a large congregation of people were inside... etc) then Mom or Dad walk in on their kid who probably shouldn't be playing this game.  Now adults look at this game where their kid is shooting into a crowd of people inside a church and all of the sudden, this becomes a problem for some.\n\nThis is why I think they will either have to put restrictions on the game, hold fast to the age ratings and get very adamant about it, or be ready to face the backlash that this becomes.",

Not arguing against you just curious.\n\nBioshock Infinite comes to mind with Christian fundamentalists. But it isn't really against christianity just people who bend it to their own needs, and fundamentalist in general. I also feel that some the modern shooters in the mid 2000 where you fought terrorists have to feature Islamic fundamentalists. It is hazy but I think *Beyond Two Souls* did as well.\n\nEDIT: One of the latest Far Cry games featured a Christian sect as well right? Or was is just a sect that had nothing to do with christianity?",

Probably no one will argue that this habit is unfair to politicians, and likely few would argue this for businessmen, but the religious leaders are commonly Christian characatures with extraordinarily few featuring other religions. I think you'd have to be pretty unfamiliar with mainstream tv, movies, and games to not see the pattern, but I'm sure I could find some kind of list for you as examples later.",

Comstock's religion borrowed the architecture, the language, the music, the culture, etc, all they did was exclude Jesus. Heck, they even included a baptism in the opening scene. Far Cry 5 did the same thing, but with more of a midwestern flair. Taking everything about Christianity *except* the core of it doesn't absolve you of mocking religion, just embrace it and call a spade a spade.",

From there he went on to create Colombia and his own pesudo-religion that mirrors all the aspects of Christianity, except doesn't mention Christ or... really anything important. But anyone who wasn't familiar with the actual theology of the Bible would definitely see the architecture and symbology and recognize it superficially as Christianity.\n\nHonestly, with the whole angel prophecy bit and the multiple universes it seems more like Mormonism than the (most likely) Baptist revival Booker attended.

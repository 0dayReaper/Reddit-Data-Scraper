The degree of success they\u2019ve had is pretty incredible.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame. Most of the great figures of the American labor movement have been working class people of exactly the kind of stock you\u2019ll see screaming about union dues taking their money now. If Bloody Harlan happened today, a bunch of the miners would just hop back in the pit to own the libs or somesuch bullshit.",

Then some political violence (bombs were *mailed* to government officials of all levels) happened, leading to the Palmer Raids in the early 1920s.\n\nThe FBI and police agencies also kept dossiers as well on 'radical leftists' throughout the Second World War and the Cold War periods.

I am fully within my right still to have a salary negotiation and go above what the union specified minimum is.\n\nThe unions I've worked for in the U.S. weren't this way. You got paid based on the union scale, and dependent on tenure, and that was pretty much it. People in skilled jobs might have more leeway in those scenarios, but if you're not... you really don't have a voice of your own, the union speaks for you.    \n     \nIt's good and bad. You make a reliable amount of guaranteed money, although even [that can be complicated,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2021/08/28/union-incomes-may-seem-better-than-non-union-but-are-they-really/?sh=2fbf1d3d6b5b) your job is generally safer, and benefits and leave time are negotiated for you (often meaning you actually get them, when non-union jobs tend not to). If you're older, union protection is extremely helpful at keeping you from being downsized; something that was a major issue in the tech fields for the corporations I worked for, one in particular, but that union had almost no power and people were laid off regularly anyway.    \n    \nWhen I was younger, it was frustrating. One company I worked for being tied to the union meant being the new guy was an absolute shit thing to be; you worked the longer hours because the longer tenured guy gets to go home first, every time. You didn't get the new, better, non-shit positions for the same reason, no matter if you were better at the job or not or more qualified or whatever. Benefits were worse than the older guys you worked with and you often paid more out of pocket, because their plans were negotiated at a different time.   \n     \nIt gets left out of the conversation in the U.S. a lot because of the political divide and bias in the conversations over union and non-union backing, but not all unions are even remotely equal here. It's not the black and white issue as it's portrayed; they *should* be good, and the idea definitely IS good, but here it can depend on the union and especially the union leadership due in no small part to union power being constantly eroded over the last half century or so.",

You aren't signing shit over to the CWA because each and every member can be involved in the bargaining process if they so choose, as a member of that union. Members are constantly consulted over what is on the table at bargains and initially for the conditions they want to see bargained for on their collective behalf.

Its no different to them patching a game on day 2 or 400. There is now a massive amount of data so a first balance pass (even if some parts might not be what players are happy with) happened and likely there will be another in a few days. We aren't calling everything before the very last patch of a game \"beta\" either.\n\nEdit: In my opinion the egregious part about the \"play early\" is that it was \"pay to get to play over the weekend\"",

Apparently its been the release day for physical media since the 80s or so?\n\nStill, as the games industry makes very clear, we are well past \"physical\" media not to mention a global market so I wouldn't be surprised if it is really starting to become a monetization choice in some cases.",

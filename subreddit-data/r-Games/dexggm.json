But everything else is great, the Magic-esque gameplay, the creative mechanics, the sheer generosity of the pricing model compared to other card games, the jank you can pull.

The raffle was the first step of viability and there is a system being designed to keep play to earn in place. I'm far from an economist myself so I can't go into specifics but I can assure you that the play to earn aspect will be viable after launch.\n\n2) Alternative play styles! That's something I can answer properly. Power creeping annoys me more than anything else in card games. I hate seeing cards devalued because there is a strictly better version. We actually have some of the worlds best TCG players such as Hoej, Xixo, Pascal Maynard, Jon Stern etc who are balance testing the game for us and we will continue to get professional players to do that for future expansions. Part of our policy is to have extremely open, honest communication with our users and the balance of the game is one of the front lines for that. I can say with confidence that power creep will be avoided at all costs.",

            "comment": "High chance that I am way too late to this thread but a word of warning about this *game*. I followed it closely when it was announced just because I thought it had a strong scam vibe behind it. I still don't believe on the longevity of what the dev is offering. A few point in no particular order that I'd like to share:\n\n- This is a Hearthstone clone. If you want more of the same, that'll be this game. The stats of a lot of cards have their counterpart in HS, specially the classic set.\n\n- The game currently have only one card set as far as I know and it has been this way since the game was announced around 1.5 year ago.\n\n- The price, in Ethereum, of the packs have always been fixed but, as you know, its not the case of ETH.\n\n- You can buy different card packs for the single card set. The most costly packs guarantees legendary cards. The price was always fixed at 0.012ETH, 0.075ETH, 0.112ETH and 1ETH **per pack**. At launch, this was equivalent to around $4.80, $30.00, $44.80 and $400 **per pack**. Today the price point is $2.10, $13.13, $19.60 and $175 per pack.\n\n- The dev claims that once a card is sold, it is unique to the blockchain it was sold to and that card can never chance. As in even if the dev decides to balance the card, the version that was sold will never be affected since it is 'in the blockchain' after it is sold. I know I probably butchered that sentence but allow me to make an analogy. Think of buying a pack of card from Hearthstone with your Credit Card. Think of the process. You buy a pack, a unique transaction ID is generated from your bank. What Gods Unchained dev supposedly do is any cards that comes out of that pack of card now have the unique transaction ID imprinted on it. So, in their server, Transaction ID 1234 has Cards X, Y and Z. That's it. People seems to think that, somehow, the transaction ID is now the card since it is easy to convince gullible people it is the case. So, the general belief is that dev will never be able to change a card because it now belongs to the *blockchain* rather than dev holding back from changing the said card *for now*.\n\n- The dev announced a $1.6m tournament at launch. The prize pool is financed by taking a 10% split from all sales of the card packs. Currently the counter is sitting at around $500k. There's no set date, nothing. You just hope that the number displayed on the website is correct and that the dev will honor their promise one day if it ever hit that amount.\n\n- Card packs were sold before there ever was any game. There was literally nothing and the dev was selling card packs. People were buying. Well more like, people were *investing* since most people back then were riding the cryptocurrency craze.\n\n- Naspers, ~~subsidiary of~~ investor in Tencent, invested $15m in this game recently. If you're sleeping under a rock, Tencent is the largest Chinese conglomerate. This bit actually makes the Tweet even more questionable.\n\nFor sure Gods Unchained dev managed to slip just in time for a good exposure by throwing shades at Blizzard but I see people singing the praise of Gods Unchained's dev in here which makes me wonder whether people are even aware what the hell they're even praising in the first place.\n\nEdit: Ugh of course this is sitting at -4 for no apparent reason/post contradicting anything I said. The amount of support in this thread for this game looked suspicious but now doubt removed after seeing how fast this dipped to the bottom.",

I don't mean to be disrespectful, since your game looks cool, but [on September 23](https://medium.com/@immutable/immutable-raises-15-million-for-gods-unchained-b235e1963fba) your company **announced on Medium that you had raised $15M USD ~~from~~ in a financing round led by Naspers, the biggest shareholder in the chinese company Tencent**. Would this be a conflict of interest, because of the political implications of your current announcement? \n\nJust to make it clear, **I am aware that you did not take money directly from Tencent**. But with Naspers being the biggest shareholder in Tencent, I'd imagine that the assumed support of Hong Kong would be a problem?\n\n---\n\n*To be as transparent as possible: I'm a big supporter of what you've just done here, and I personally stand with Hong Kong.*\n\n---\n\nEdit: *\"$15M USD from Naspers\"* to *\"$15M USD in a financing round led by Naspers\"*",

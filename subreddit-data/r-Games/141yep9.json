There were several versions that were functionally remakes of earlier games, but with a female protagonist instead of a male protagonist and with several of the male characters able to be married. [Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Back_to_Nature) this title was literally re-released as \"\u7267\u5834\u7269\u8a9e\uff5e\u30cf\u30fc\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\uff5efor\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\" which I don't know if you know katakana, but the last bit of that is literally \"for gaa-ru\" or \"for girl\".",

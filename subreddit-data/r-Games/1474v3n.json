It'll still be a good chance to see how it actually plays though.\n\nSeems like a safe guess that there'll be one race from each Grand Alliance, and I'm pretty sure a Tzeentch unit was spotted in one of the initial screenshots released.  Last one is probably some Death race.  Plus the trailer talks about Death and Fate so these predictions seem even more likely now.",

I know Elite was rocky but everything else they put out afaik has been acceptable even if not mind blowing.",

No base building. It effectively was more about capture the hill combat over resources and reacting in time with the right counters, while cutting your losses and recouperating when you needed to. Based on this trailer, this seems to go that direction.",

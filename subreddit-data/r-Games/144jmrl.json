Most people stream movies rather than buy them and most of those that don't either pirate or buy physical because they have a collection. The digital copy is convenient but doesn't replace a physical copy and used physical copies are near worthless so there's not really a market for people buying blu-rays, using the code and selling off the disc. \n\nWith games, piracy and streaming aren't nearly as much of a factor since piracy for console games is practically nonexistent and most subscriptions don't offer the newest big releases. This makes a digital code much more valuable and for some people, preferable to a physical copy. \n\nYou can easily resell a physical game for just $10 less than you paid if you sell it right at launch. Even if it was only half, would you rather buy a game for $70 or $35?",

Maybe Anti-Ock too.\n\nThey've still got a bunch of designs from the comics and shows to run through, mind.\n\n* Sensational\n\n* Cosmic\n\n* Identity Crisis suits\n\n* whatever Symbiote suits they add (at the bare minimum their design, a classic more cloth-like look, Raimi, Go Down Swinging. I wouldn't be surprised if they saved stuff like Spectacular and Ultimate suits for this game so they can immediately add Symbiote variations)\n\n* Superior suits (assuming those plot beats aren't a part of the third game)\n\n* Alex Ross movie design (if Superior suits make it into the game)\n\n* as mentioned before: an Ultimate/Bagley design with Symbiote\n\n* and Spectacular with Symbiote\n\n* Unlimited\n\n* maybe classic suit variations for major artists like Ditko and McFarlane. If they're going to add colour variations for some suits I can see them using a similar system to allow for artist design variations - maybe you could also see this done just for swapping out the logos and such. (I really want the second Romita Sr. design officially in the game, definitive Spider-Man to me)\n\n* while there's definitely other stuff I've forgotten, I also think there's a fair chance they'll introduce a female Spider-Man in the third game (personally hoping for MJ as Spinneret but of course I wouldn't be surprised if it was nu-Gwen as she's conspicuously absent from the series so far). In that case there's a bunch more suits they could do - if it's Gwen, Spinneret, Mayday, Earth X Venom, Ultimate Jessica Drew, Julia Carpenter, Silk, blah blah blah.",

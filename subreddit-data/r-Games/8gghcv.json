    "postText": "The hypetrain is about to start for Rockstar and Take2s next AAA title Red Dead Redemption 2. I hope I am not alone in wanting an honest discussion around the role Rockstars publisher Take2 and Rockstars monetary miracle GTAO will play here. There are many sides to this debate but I think we all can agree it needs to be adressed. If you do not agree with some of these points I will list below, just provide input, as some of them are highly debatable. Here is what I gathered so far:\n\n* [5 years of no single player titles.](https://i.redd.it/d114qxtarp401.jpg) \n\n* [Scraps promised single player DLC that then quietly is converted to MMO material.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgbCSmtYUZs)\n\n* [Rockstar sent the creative community of modders a cease and desist even though modders have kept their games alive through mods through the years, effectively marketing the game and generating Rockstar income.](https://www.vg247.com/2017/06/14/popular-gta-mod-openiv-has-been-shut-down-by-rockstar-lawyers-after-10-years/)\n\n* [Scrapping everything else to work on a model that contributes to gaming spending addiction among kids.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/06/fears-children-addicted-online-games)\n\n* [They designed GTAO so that it favours the rich and big spending gamer, and not the most skilled, effectively making it pay2win.](https://kotaku.com/in-gta-online-the-rich-are-ruining-games-with-expensiv-1821821192)\n\n* [Items in GTAO have become ridiculously expensive, making it so that you have to buy shark cards unless you can treat the grind like a full time job.](https://kotaku.com/the-good-and-bad-of-gta-online-four-years-later-1819080293)\n\n* [A plan for the future by publisher CEO Strauss Zelnick to focus more on MTA and \"consumer spending hooks\".](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/309190/TakeTwo_plans_to_only_release_games_with_recurrent_consumer_spending_hooks.php)\n\nHow do you view these things, should we be alarmed for RDR2 or should we trust Rockstar, since they don't usually disappoint? Feel free to provide your input as well as additional sources, since these were just from the top of my head.",

Benzies had no role in its making until, he says, things started to fall apart\n\n&gt; Benzies alleges that Sam Houser sent him the following email message. \"PLEASE help me/us get [Read Dead Redemption] into shape.

The GTA series has some of the most incredible attention to detail of any games made. As an example, in GTA IV, your radio would get GSM interference right before receiving a phone call, just like in real life. That's dedication on the part of the sound design team.\n\nRemember the promotional material for the first RDR? They had a whole series of videos focused on the attention to detail in recreating the old West, from the horses, to the towns.\n\nThe talent that contributes to those sorts of experiences isn't necessarily going to be the same given the long period of profiteering on GTA: Online.\n\nTempering expectations is a smart idea. Development teams change over time, and the company label on the box isn't the marker of consistency many treat it as. Look what happened with Infinity Ward, or BioWare, or any of the other many studios where a parent company disrupted the development ecosystem.\n\nI really, really want to see Rockstar maintain their level of quality, as there's no one else out there doing what they did best (sandbox masterpieces). But we can't just assume that to be the case given the company operations and workforce shifts over the past years.",

So someone sees that they are going on strike and wonders why they need too. All it is is talking, right?  So obviously theyre just being greedy.\n\nAnd that isnt actually true, but most people just don't know any better. Same goes for game devs honestly. Most people that dont look into it would probably assume that its like any other corporate office job with reasonable hours, maybe some occasional overtime, and it had the upside that youre making something cool! So how dare you complain.\n\nAnd thats just what will keep happening until theres enough widespread knowledge to actually galvanize some change.",

But that was a kneejerk reaction from folks who had never really taken the idea of video game industry unions seriously. By the end of the strike, the conversation had moved toward, \"well hey, devs have it worse, so maybe they should unionize too.\"",

If GTAO wasn't so successful and didn't have such a high ROI, we'd have gotten SP DLC for GTA 5. I fear the same thing will happen to RDR 2.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I feel I got my 60\u20ac worth (and then some) of entertainment out of GTA 5 without ever touching the multiplayer. I would have gladly paid for good quality SP DLC, but sadly that wasn't an option.",

The game just isn\u2019t fun to play and dick around in unless you\u2019ve got this stuff because you end up so outclassed by these people.\n\nCoupled with the fact that hackers and cheaters are absolutely rampant still, and rockstar has done very little to combat them besides issuing massive ban waves that often catch innocent players. Of course R$ focused on preventing money duping glitches though, but they don\u2019t give a fuck if someone spawns a hundred ferris wheels and crashes the lobby, or people simply making themselves invincible.

This is so there is a punishment for when you decide to drown your Bugatti or APC in the ocean. However, if someone destroys your vehicle they have to pay the insurance premium instead. Which in a game that seems to be all about griefing nowadays is a little bit unfair. Say you\u2019re a new player, some douche nozzle in his super flying bike is harassing you, but you manage to actually destroy it and kill him. Too bad for you, all your money is gone now to pay for the vehicle you just destroyed.",

What people would do it's kill you and destroy your car. You'd respawn near where you were killed and then have to try and recover your car from the in-game insurance company before being murdered again. \n\nIf you did manage to recover it, you'd likely get killed by a hacker moments later anyway. Combined with cool down times on vehicle summons, your never really be able to get your car.\n\nTo combat this Rockstar made it so that the person who destroy the vehicle has to pay a percentage of it's cost as punishment. Now, with some cars costing several million in-game, accidently destroying a player car can bankrupt some players. In the end this system never made a difference anyway as, in my experience, the griefers are also either working with a hacker or are on themselves - they have infinite money so the punishment only hurts honest players.",

Personally, I'd pay (and previously have paid) $10-15 for quality story missions that expand on the game lore and maybe threw in a couple cosmetics/toys. Then again, I play for the story foremost, so character customization doesn't do much for me. Well, aside from developers' relatively recent knowledge that not everyone is a white male, it's been nice being able to play as a character that looks a little more like me. Not a political statement, I genuinely appreciate being able to play as a brown guy these days in most games and don't really have a problem if the character is fixed for story reasons (Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia, Tomb Raider, Uncharted, RDR1, etc.).",

The problem is that if you watch videos of people doing fun stuff in GTAO then often they are doing things or playing with things that can be gated behind having \"earned\" enough cash, which of course requires dedication or buying Shark Cards, and believe me, it is a major, major grind to do it without SCs\n\nI have played a serious number of hours online exclusively with friends without paying for cards, as well as running through the single player storyline and I have to say that whilst neither aspect is completely satisfying, both have independently provided excellent value for money and lots of fun\n\nGrinding is seriously painful though. If your aim is to own everything in GTAO then you are not going to have fun doing it. If you are happy to pick things up just based on what you have earned whilst having fun then you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it\n\nPS Fuck Shark cards! Don't buy them. Please!",

All of the business and bunker stuff works fine regardless of if you're alone, or playing with friends. The problem is you kind of need to do the heists in order to make enough money to buy your first business. Once you have one, however, the grind gets a lot easier and you don't need to have 3 friends on to do them reliably. I personally don't mind the grind once you have a business or two. The things about GTA:O that really bother me are the hackers on PC (which can be easily avoided by doing public solo sessions) and how shark cards are offensively over priced. $100 should get you multiple DLCs worth of content instead it allows you to buy two or three expensive vehicles before you're out of money.",

GTA/Red Dead's sales numbers are enormous just for the single player component, and it stands to reason that a large portion of their online player base originally bought the game for the single player, and from that decided to give online a try. \n\nIf they decided to ditch the important single player aspects (A long story driven campaign with a lot of diverse missions and characters) and only focus on multi player I think their multiplayer audience for that game would take a massive hit. \n\nI imagine they can get away with merging singleplayer and multiplayer in interesting ways though (something akin to Dark Souls.)

If you're seriously trying to compare the BF and COD developers to RockStar, I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you just don't play video games.",

Rockstar has seen the most financial success for the game in setting higher and higher price points on in-game things and locking some GTAO content behind it. The lesson Rockstar learned is that shark cards and multiplayer updates were much more beneficial than anything they could have done with single-player DLCs.\n\nI think the fear here is of these MTAs bleeding into the single-player game. For sure, you have the option to be a responsible consumer and not buy into whatever MTAs might show up. However, there's a right to be concerned that the single-player experience might be designed with MTAs purchases in mind, much like Shadow of War was.",

With those in place it's not difficult to play for a few hours every now and again to build up enough money for the new, important stuff that gets released.\n\nI don't know how many shark cards are sold on PC, but I can't imagine it's anywhere near as high as on console because of how easy it has been for hackers to give (or in some cases, remove) money to everyone in the lobby. Perhaps it's a different world on PC, for some reason it keeps dragging me back in (and I haven't spent a penny).",

Things change all the time, its not like they took money from people for single player DLC, they said they would do some then changed their mind. This is allowed.\n\nI don't think OP is saying that its illegal/unethical for them to do this. For me, I take that as evidence that they are moving away from traditional story focused single player games (which you pay for up front and that's that) towards the 'live service' model that is defined by the kind of 'recurrent consumer spending hooks' Zelnick wants. The same is true for the\n\n&gt; 5 years\n\nthing. Yeah OP may have been being disingenuous to further his point, but I think you are as well by splitting hairs like this. Not releasing any games in 5 years is still very revealing that they are going for the live service model - milking the gamers as much as they can with microtransactions rather than releasing games. I mean the timeline in OP's post is pretty damning. From 1997-2013 they released 33 full games (not counting many excellent DLC's like Episodes from Liberty City or RDR Zombies). That's 2 a year on average. They've gone from that to 1 in 5 years. A literal tenfold decrease in game output, undoubtedly because they're milking the GTAO cash cow.\n\nI think this (and Zelnick's own words) means that OP is justified in being concerned about Take 2/Rockstar ruining RDR2 with microtransactions.",

We had GTA IV, GTA V, RDR and Max Payne 3... none of those would really fit the \"smaller sp games\" unless you call out MP3 for being linear.  Oh and I Table Tennis.... but that was more of a tech demo for RAGE.\n\nUnless you're talking about last-last gen on the PS2... then yes, they had a lot of things like Manhunt 1 and 2, The Warriors, Bully, that racing game and all of the GTA games.\n\nBut those games were far less detailed and easier for their teams to throw together.  Hell, the GTA games almost came out yearly.\n\nGames like GTA IV and V take a lot more time and resources due to the insane level of detail in the cities alone.  So I don't expect them to put out games PS2-quick.\n\nAre they cashing in on shark cards?  Yes.  Do I think that's going to hurt the base single player experience in their games?  No.  Will it stop single player DLC?  Unfortunately, it appears so.  But as long as the base game is great (as GTA V was imo) then I don't care.",

I have every expectation that this will be a very very good single player game. Lets be honest, for a lot of people, they could just re release the last one with modern graphics improvements, and it would be on the top sellers list for a while, but I digress.\n\nHowever, I have absolutely zero expectation of anything ever being added to the single player game beyond whatever comes on the original disc/download. GTAO has changed everything for them regarding how a game ages. Initial sales are still based on the quality of the game, an they will be fine in that regard. But they are not going to waste resources on developing 1st person DLC at $15-20 a pop for a fair bit of work, when they can sell different horses, hats, coats, and pistols for years and years instead, make more money on it, and not have to spend nearly as much developing it.\n\nIt is a great shame, but this is the way of the world now for gaming. Its not all bad. 15 years ago there was no DLC either and we all got by just fine remember",

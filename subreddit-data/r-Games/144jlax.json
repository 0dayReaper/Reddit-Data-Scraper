And if you were to have both digital code as well as a physical disc in the collection, one person could buy one game for two people. \n\nBut on the other hand, I guess they could make two different versions of the collectors edition.

Also, sooner or later, the game will most likely available for 10\u20ac or less which imo is an ok price to pay for being able to play the game after psn was shutdown",

The knickknacks are the whole point of it. If you only care about the game, then the standard edition exists. If you absolutely need the disk, you can sell the code and buy the disk.\n\n&gt; In 15 years people who want to play Spider-Man 2 on PS5 will be having some interesting stuff to work through.\n\nWhat \"interesting stuff?\" It's literally just log in, download, and play.

Hopefully it will be for PC and by then it surely will, but that's beside the point.

We all know backwards compatibility doesn't matter to these companies, so I'm in the camp of if you've owned it play it how you want.",

But even after HFW and GOWR i don't get the complaints about \"why is there a steelbook without a disc?\" Because it looks pretty and has been a standard in 99% of CEs of the past 15 years.\n\nI own almost 200 Steelbooks from movies and games and almost none of them contain their discs. Why? Because the steelbooks are in sleeves to prevent scratches or other damages. And beeing empty makes them not one bit less good to look at.",

Eddie because spider-man ruined his career by catching the real killer after he publicly exposed someone else as being the killer. While the symbiote hates Peter for rejecting it. So Eddie goes to a church to possibly commit suicide that happens to be the same church spider man uses to get rid of the symbiote. \n\nWhile it may be jarring all Eddie has to be is some disgraced journalist in the area to get the base of it. Hell eddie worked for tabloids before he bonded. Maybe he\u2019s JJJ\u2019s new intern. \n\nWould be interesting",

I\u2019m going to throw a Hail Mary and say we\u2019re going assume Venom is Harry throughout the game, but instead they change it up and deliver a twist and it\u2019s Norman Osborn as Venom. \n\nIn the Ultimate Comics, Norman Osborn\u2019s Green Goblin is more mutant/monstrous and less tech based. So, they take elements and adapt Venom differently for this games rendition of the character. \n\nSo, they leave Harry Osborn to become the Green Goblin in the third game. I think Dr. Connor\u2019s \u201ccures\u201d Harry\u2019s illness, but it will have other side effects, which will then form the Green Goblin personality.\n\nSo, the first game is Doc Ock. The second game is Venom. The third game is Green Goblin. Spider-Man\u2019s three main arch-nemesis centered around each game.",

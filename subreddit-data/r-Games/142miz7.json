You can play through almost the entire campaign with friends, with only a small tutorial section in the beginning requiring SP.",

There are some really cool but short side quests. The setting is what drove me to play it. Tokyo is really well realised and it looks great. There\u2019s a point where you unlock a power that enables vertical movement and gliding, and the game opens up a bit but eventually that gets boring too cos all you\u2019re doing is collecting stuff.",

I've been living in Tokyo for the past 6 years (I actually live 10 minutes from Shibuya, the area that the game takes place in) and they absolutely nailed the look and feel of the city, down to the fire escapes and faucets and shit. It's insanely well-crafted. Also all the urban legends, yokai, and Shinto influence in the game is so rich and unique. Loved every second of it.",

                    "comment": "Ghostwire Tokyo - combat system is solid enough, but it doesn't expand much beyond what you get early on in the game. There's one or two upgrades you can pick up that makes things flow a little better, but you're essentially playing the same way through most of the game. Traversal is decent, and it's definitely cool exploring Tokyo. My favorite part of the game was the side quests - there are some pretty cool stories for the first encounter, but every subsequent encounter becomes less interesting and feels more copy-pasted. In a nutshell, there's a decent foundation there that keeps you going early on, but the systems and quests don't expand enough later on to keep your attention and everything ultimately boils down to a checklist of things to do.\n\nRemnant From the Ashes - was one of my favorite games when I got it, and the co-op is no different. Maps are procedurally generated, but the combat system, unique encounters and customizations are broad enough to keep you trying out lots of different playstyles. I had a blast playing around with different builds and guns, and even dipped into more supportive playstyles when doing coop.",

Trying to mess with the settings over and over and not getting anywhere wasn't something I wanted to keep spending time on.\n\nIt's weird that this is a problem we've seen crop up more recently.  I didn't even used to need to adjust sensitivities and such back in the 360 days and games worked fine.\n\nControls aside, there's a whole bunch of notes to collect, and I got fixated on those to the point of distraction from the actual environment and progressing missions.\n\nCutscenes, at least initially, felt pretty long, but maybe that's a western perspective.",

Ok, maybe the latter would've been a weird title, but I've seen weirder. Grime should be a great game, too. I'll buy this one just for it and Ghostwire.",

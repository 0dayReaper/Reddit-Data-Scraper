The entire thing took place in corridors that were disguised as open spaces, but you actually had very little room maneuver most of the time. This probably lends itself well to VR where navigation and movement are some of the biggest challenges.",

The reduced FoV helps people somehow.\n\nAnother option is to add some kind of HUD to the screen to give the player a central focus that isn't moving (more-or-less like the cockpit of a mech or race car).\n\nAlso, walking in place while in-game movement happens helps for a ton of people - as well as exiting the game and taking a break when you start to feel 'forehead sweats' (that feeling you get before nausea starts to really kick in).\n\nA lot of VR games now will give you a menu with different comfort options you can turn on or off depending on your personal needs.",

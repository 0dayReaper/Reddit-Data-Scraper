It looks great.\n\nNot sure what engine they made this in but it makes me wonder if as much of it as they showed in the video is complete, I imagine they could also swap in CS and DoD assets and make a decently fun competitive multiplayer game out of it.",

As long as you're not infringing their trademarks in a way that makes it look like it's their game, they're generally pretty relaxed about people using their IP.",

Whether the quality is \"Hunt Down the Freeman\" or \"Black Mesa\", they are not showing a preferential bias towards one artist or another.\n\nLegally, I would think its not the wisest move, but as fans, we always talk about how mega-conglomerates like Nintendo, for example, stomp on the necks of really interesting projects, presumably to protect their IP. While Valve is out here saying \"Yeah, sure, use that shit. In fact, go ahead and sell it if it meets the requirements to be on the Steam storefront.\"",

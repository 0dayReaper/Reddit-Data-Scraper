            "comment": "So for those curious about FFXVI's music direction, [there's a snippet in Gameinformer's FFXVI-feature with an interview with FFXVI's composer Masayoshi Soken](https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-feature/2023/06/05/the-music-of-final-fantasy-16-part-3-finding-a-main-theme), and where they detail for instance that FFXVI's music doesn't have a single centered main theme to derivative its leitmotif towards other tracks, aiming instead on multiplying it by having a specific theme being for each major character, and allowing that character theme being the leitmotif of for other tracks. As an example, [Cid's theme has an epic, orchestral version](https://twitter.com/FF16_JP/status/1667109290350460929), as well as a more [calmer version with strings and drums for the Hideaway-HUB area that he is the leader of.](https://youtu.be/UfP_3UD5qF8?t=790) I suspect a similar case will be made for Clive's theme, where he has his triumphant moments being played out along with the downtime-moments.\n\nFFXVI's Japanese Twitter-account seems to also be currently making daily 15-second long character introduction, and where each video is speculated having snippets of each character's \"theme\" as well. Beside Clive's and Cid's themes that has been mentioned previously, there has so far also been showing up [Joshua Rosfield's theme](https://twitter.com/FF16_JP/status/1666067416236056576), [Jill Warrick's theme](https://twitter.com/FF16_JP/status/1666384510135721987) and [Torgal's theme](https://twitter.com/FF16_JP/status/1666746892879896578), with future characters and their themes most likely being revealed at a later date.\n\nIn addition, it is worth mentioning that FFXVI does have a dedicated theme song to it, akin to it in the style of [*Kingdom Hearts II*'s song *Sanctuary* by artist Utada Hikaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTUq3Ik1GHM), that is a licensed music composed and written by another artist dedicated for the game, to which for FFXVI it will be the song [*Tsuki Wo Miteita* (\"*Moongazing*\") by artist Kenshi Yonezu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ScSEP42Bf0), and which was composed and written by Yonezu after he had played FFXVI.\n\nThere's some additional tid-bits of news surrounding the music, such as [how FFXVI's victory fanfare will, for the first time in the series, have lyrics added to them](https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-16-fanfare-lyrics-ancient-greek/), and in line with FFXVI's historical atmosphere, have the lyrics being written in ancient Greek, which apparently has major spoilers surrounding its meaning, but unless you know ancient Greek it is a big likelihood that it is something that will go way over your head.",

It's definitely not as immediately distinctive as some of the earlier games, more like big Hollywood music (although with a lot more melody).\n\nPersonally I didn't get the appeal of Soken's work at all until I actually played FFXIV. It can be really flat in terms of dynamics, and sometimes feels like a big impenetrable wall of sound when he's going full force. But he tends to use motifs heavily, and I feel like being familiar with them lets you digest the song in pieces and makes them come to life.",

I think it\u2019s a combination of flat dynamics, the whole song is just forte with mostly no break, sitting in the key aside from the cool progression at 1:45ish, and the use of the 3/3/3/3/2/2 8th note rhythm repeating over and over, which (again, in my personal opinion) I\u2019ve heard a million times. It feels pretty bland to me. \n\nCompare that to Uematsu\u2019s haunting progressions and non-diatonic chords, or the beautiful jazz of Hamauzu (Pulse de Chocobo absolutely slaps). Even when I didn\u2019t love every single piece it felt distinctly Final Fantasy and memorable.\n\nI\u2019m a fan of Soken\u2019s work in FFXIV, though I will admit I haven\u2019t yet finished the expansions or listened to all of the soundtrack. But this is supposed to be the main theme of the main character, and honestly I had to go listen to it again to collect my thoughts because I forgot it almost as soon as I heard it the first time.\n\nI\u2019m super hyped for this game and I think that Soken will most likely do a good job overall on the soundtrack. This one just didn\u2019t do it for me.",

SE admitted in their interviews that the idea for XVI was inspired by Game Of Thrones and they deliberately made the game based on it.\n\nEven if you want to claim Game Of Thrones was fresh and genre-defining and pioneered the \"dark fantasy\" genre when it came out (which is debatable), by this point something that tries to clone it is just going to be that - a clone, just another entry in the genre. They even went full European-lookalike aesthetic and ethnicity similar to GoT.\n\nDoesn't help that the battle system is also cited to be inspired heavily by God of War and Devil May Cry, to the point they brought the guy who worked the DMC5 system to help make it. So even the combat mechanics are cloned from other famous games in the genre.\n\nPeople are expecting it to be highly polished and high quality, but certainly not mechanically fresh or new.",

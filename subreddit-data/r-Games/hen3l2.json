Strangely enough though, Blizzard backpedaled and claimed he refused to sign an event NDA which he claims he had never heard of. Still a slimey company.",

WW isn't even in the wrong there: TS2 is an *amazing* game that holds up in quality compared to HL but also sold gangbusters compared to HL, but it goes to show that the mindset of oversimplification that killed Spore (Which Maxis never really recovered from) wasn't just coming from EA, yet quite a few people still hold then singularly responsible for the direction that Maxis took and The Sims took/continues to take.\n\nI don't even like EA as a company, I'd basically sworn them off until we had all that good news coming in...Now I'm watching to see what they do, if they do something big like announce a TS5 that's directly aimed at fixing the long-running issues with the franchise then I might be looking at actually purchasing their games again.

It's not that these game companies all of a sudden got shit, I mean remember the drama over horse armor dlc in Oblivion, even then they were trying to figure out more ways to monetize.\n\nIt's the same story at every company Bioware, Bethesda, Rockstar, Blizzard, Valve pioneered most of the cross over monetization methods even and mastered it. You can make cool games only if you add some continuing monetization scheme. Sometimes it works out and is okay like RDR2 and GTA5 we get a great, sprawling single player experience albeit with no single player dlc anymore or it works out horribly like Fallout 76.",

They finally realized what many players are willing to pay through years of experimentation and research (not that this doesn't happen all the time, but there were a ton of bigger changes in how it approaches the market recently). I could go on and on because I really love that game, but haven't been able to play in months. I haven't been able to play as competitively in years.\n\nI feel like you could go through this thought process with most everything and track 90% of products back to unethical practices. I compromised (gave up) and went the \"don't give them much money, but still play their games\" route when it comes to Legends of Runeterra.",

Bad corporate management is usually \"Sure we could make money but how minimal can we spend in order to make the maximum short-term profit?\"\n\nThere can be a lot of reasons for this flawed mentality, but generally it often has to do with a lack of passion for the company they work in.  If you have a reputation for putting out good games, you don't just have a value in how much you can get for any given game you release - you have consumer trust.  A shitty manager will  come into a company oblivious of what the standards are, and just try to shovel out whatever the fuck so that they can have nice pretty numbers to demand a raise or promotion with while downplaying the backlash.",

I'm sure there are talented and passionate devs, but culture is established at the top, and scumbags in general hire/promote other scumbags. And when you have Bobby Kotick and 'You think you do, but you don't' Allen Brack running the show, well...\n\nJust within the past few years alone, we've had the death of HotS, Blitzchung/HK \"tough\" HS esports moment, Diablo Immoral, War3Refunded, 800 layoffs despite 'record profits,' investors appalled at Kotick's reimbursement, we \"totally support\" black lives matter, among many more I'm sure I'm missing.\n\nHow many more 'controversies' does it take to finally realize, it's not a PR or image problem, it's a rot at the very heart of the company.",

Sociologically the US is already starting to meet the criteria of fascism/statism at this stage (mass demonization of separate demographics, defined from the top-down by the administration).",

Its veracity wouldn't surprise me. I doubt it's for her [support of unionization](https://twitter.com/ZerinaX/status/1120749220128890881).\n\n----\n\nAnd a thought: Is this Blizzard implying \"Keep your woman in line, or else?\" Punishing men for their wives voicing their opinion?",

I played through slow/no updates or balance changes, copy/paste expansions, removal of \"free\" updates, increase on overall annual cost to maintain standard decks.\n\nBlizzard really has nothing left.  With POE being so community oriented, Diablo 4 isn't something I will waste money on.  Their MOBA died.  Overwatch is dying, despite dressing up a content patch as Overwatch 2.\n\nTheir final flame is WoW Classic.  That flame is dwindling as they are completely deaf to the community.\n\nIt's clear across all of their games, every expansion, sequel, or update, that is 100% profit driven with nothing for players.",

Every season, laddered hit legend a couple times etc. But boy did you hit the nail on the head. They really made it a chore to keep up with that game and everything seemed driven by money/profits. Somehow one of my favorite games ever became a shell of itself and I quickly lost any desire to play. Sad stuff.",

The original FF7 instead, is not written with Crisis Core in mind, and you can play it without it.  \n\n\nOf course, it' s additional material, the main story is still gonna be 100% understandable, but some of the plot elements could be lost on you.",

You can probably get away with it, but you may miss some finer details. CC is a lot more fun to actually play now, but the dialogue is really really rough. The actual plot is fine, but it's not presented well. I played it again early this year, and while I enjoyed it, it was absolutely a mid-2000s square game.",

The game being a straight up action game is also generic in an era where 90% of big RPGs have switched to action combat. But I expect the story to be better than FF7Rs story for sure and hopefully the gameplay turns out to be interesting.",

Now I don't know how well that experience would translate to a single player game, but I have faith in the team that have created what is considered to be one of the greatest stories told in all of gaming, not just in Final Fantasy. \n\nIn comparison, I was very disappointed in part 1 of FF7. I did not like the changes to the story, but let's not get into that. The combat while fine for the most part, had several instances where it just did not work for me (flying enemies in particular). The pacing was just awful in several parts such as Hojo's lab. I understand that they wanted to stretch the few opening hours of the original into a full game, but they really didn't need to. The only major benefit I saw to that was expanding upon and greater developing the members of Avalanche. I was sad how the song remixes mostly failed to capture the feelings of the original songs. Most of the music just felt generic and unimpressive to me. Then I wanted to get all the trophies so I forced myself to play through hard mode, which was a major mistake. That was what probably tainted the experience most for me.",

And with how she talks like in the chapter 14 dream sequence, she *knows* she has to die. Tifa dying has an impact on Cloud and his friends, Aerith dying has an impact on *the planet.*!&lt;\n\nI feel like a lot of FF7R is about retreading ground in a way to try and make use feel the same way about these new experiences that we did with the original. For example how we have a new mystery around &gt;!Zack, this time it's less about who he is (though of course that mystery still exists for newcomers to FF7) and more on what he's doing alive in another timeline.!&lt; So I'm imagining something like &gt;!Sephiroth knowing not to kill Aerith because doing that messes up his plans, so to make us feel similarly either Aerith has to willingly sacrifice herself or maybe Cloud has to be the one to kill her.!&lt;\n\nGranted, from the Yuffie DLC it almost seems to be implying that &gt;!Aerith is dead in Zack's timeline so something could be done with that.!&lt;\n\nThe story for the vast majority of Remake was done super well and an excellent retelling and fleshing out of the events of the original, so I expect more of the same from Rebirth.",

Some stuff might get cut or handled badly, I don't see that as a reason to be overly pessimistic. \n\nOn the other hand, there's also probably going to be good new additions like the Avalance stuff in the first part. With Yuffie being a non-optional member, Wutai has promise to be more interesting than it was in the original, for example.",

Still, unlike some who proclaim it not a remake at all and feel like they ruined the game completely, as a whole I was very pleased with what we got, and enjoy it as an adaptation of the original story.\n\nFor that reason I'd hate for them not to adapt such a pivotal scene of the original game. *Maybe* they'd be able to write their way into something narratively satisfying even without it, but it seems much more likely that they'd trade off an iconic scene for a moment of shock and awe but an overall weaker story.",

It's basically a new, full game where the entire Midgard section from the original FF7 is basically double or triple the length of the original game now, including the DLC story featuring Yuffie. It's three acts split up into full fledged games on their own that make up a new trilogy.\n\nAs for the actual reasons why its a completely \"new\" story I think that's quite divisive. I personally love it cause like, fuck it, if you're going to do this again may as well go do some crazy shit to make it fun and new again.",

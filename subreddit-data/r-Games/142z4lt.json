For example, Diablo 3 on consoles - different mechanics (roll), different camera with AI that functions differently, powers have different cooldowns, different number of enemies on screen, etc.   So you cant implement pad support in Diablo 3 because its a different game on PC than on consoles.  It would mess up the gameplay and balance in a massive way",

There is no button to map to, the inventory system is fully mouse-based, and that's the problem.\n\nLike in the inventory grid, you have items of different sizes, and for a good controller experience there would need to be a selection highlight on the currently selected item and pressing one of the D-pad buttons would switch to the nearest item in that direction.",

I know there are controller guidelines on consoles and they can be a little picky with certain things so with something like this it might be a big deal. One can hope it gets improved either way though",

It fulfills a childhood wish I've had ever since I played Duke Nukem 3D with my grandpa: just a huge, futuristic, detailed space station to explore. I'd say that so far, it's my favorite game this year, ahead of the fun yet too-safe TotK and the massive yet extremely unstable Jedi Survivor.",

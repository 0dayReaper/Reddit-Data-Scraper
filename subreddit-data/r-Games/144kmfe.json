Transformers Rise of the Beasts is soon to release and the theme of the season feels as equal as the setting of the upcoming movie.\n\nThe motivation of playing Fortnite for me was the lore and the feeling that you\u2019re are participating on something unique. Now the game feels like a next-gen advertising platform, with all those collabs, TikTok dances, celebrities, etc.",

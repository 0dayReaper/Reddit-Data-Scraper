    "postText": "According to tweets today, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre game's publisher says adding content from movies is not easy due to licensing rights \n\n&gt; \"Friendly reminder. We have the interactive rights to the 1974 film. We can't put characters or locations in from other TX films because we don't have those rights. \n&gt; \n&gt; Demanding we add them is not how Hollywood works. Licensing in general is usually a total mess.\n&gt; \n&gt; My advice to you:\n&gt; \n&gt; Get hyped for what's there. Tell everyone you know. Post on social, retweet, and discuss the game. \n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience Hollywood reacts to buzz, not demands.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/weskeltner/status/1664638997111488515\n\nhttps://twitter.com/weskeltner/status/1664641189654429707",

The right\u2019s situation for the film is a complete clusterfuck due to it being split between Dario Argento and his family for the international rights and Richard P. Rubinstein for the domestic rights. And considering Rubinstein has been blocking a home release of the movie in the us because he wants to put out his own 3D print of the film, it looks like import or bootleg is the only realistic way to watch the film in the US.",

Likeness rights are also not the same as character rights always. It\u2019s weird. \n\nLike take Avatar. Mostly they\u2019re blue giant people, but one is also sigourney weaver - the person. \n\nSo if I wanted to do some thing with that character, I have all the rights to Navi Sigourney, but the human one I have to get permissions for. Wild right?\n\nFor entire sequels different studios might have different rights. Even Star Wars! When lucasfiln sold to Disney, Fox still had the rights to the original films. Not the content but the movies. So if Disney wanted to do a new Blu-ray or rerelease ahead of ep7, they could not without fox permission.  Of course they own fox now so they control it totally. \n\nOlder films are the worst tho. There are entire franchises that because of rights management we won\u2019t see new shit made because they literally don\u2019t know who owns the rights anymore!",

You might have a case where that one film you want to add into your game is owned by a studio that is stubborn just because they can be and won't even field phone calls.",

Companies go out of business, which leads to law firms ending up with movie rights as payment and sometimes they dont even know who has the rights to something. Evil Dead is a great example because each of the first 3 films have different rights holders.",

It wasn't strictly a movie tie in, it was based off the comics, and all designs were based on existing comic designs, including likenesses. Anyone claiming it looked like a \"bootleg team\" just has never paid attention to the comics past the 60s and 70s. Why pay for actor likenesses when they had a huge amount of references to choose from, all of which were free in comparison?",

When I looked up the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (TCM) game and hearing the dev is having trouble to even acquire license to explore that very IP, it does paint a bleak picture.\n\nI watched the gameplay of TCM and I feel the novelty would wear off very fast given there's only one location (correct me if I am wrong) and the location itself is very straight forward in the sense there's very little variation it seems. You're also forced into a tiny set of characters and the characters on the Killer side looks so goofy when they run around. Adding all this together makes it an easy pass for me.\n\nI really wish there was more competition against DBD but I feel DBD sits on a rather high pedestal at this point and it would take at least a game with a decent gameplay loop with a nice variety to convince people to even try it.",

It's not flawless, but it does provide a fun, skill-based experience for both parties that you want to return to. It's addicting like Quake or Smash Bros. All the other asyms feel extremely clunky, slow and just plain unpolished in comparison - in other words, they don't feel good to play.\n\n&gt; I really wish there was more competition against DBD\n\nSame. Haven't played it in a couple of years because I got tired of the lack of anticheat, and I don't think that's ever improving until BHVR are scared through healthy competition.

The reason they were advised to not create anymore content for f13th is because all the sequel movies licensing was in dispute from the original creator. Should the game have been based solely around the first movie (with additional custom content), the game would have lived on. But since the game already had sequel content, this created a licensing issue. Even the mere presence of Jason was an issue because he wasn't in the first movie outside of the last 2 seconds. Fun fact, the creator said Jason was never supposed to be a killer but a victim of abuse and bullying which was one of his main motivators in sueing.\n\n\nThis is why the developers only got the license for the first TCM. If the licensing for any of the sequels was to be up in the air for whatever reason, the game wont have the same problems as F13th as it doesnt contain any content from the sequel films. If they create content around any of the sequels, then the game could potentially be in trouble later down the track. This is the reason why the devs are saying it's very unlikely they'll use any sequel content and will focus purely on custom.",

They quite clearly can create whatever custom content they like, even perhaps inspired by the sequels. For example a carnival or a theme park, local network station, abandoned mine, a factory, local school set during prom, etc.\n\nVictim content can obviously be limitless, the only concern that I potentially have is how many killers can they realistically keep creating? They'd have to start developing ones outside of the family (neighboring family, or people who succumbed to stockholm) which might be a little weird at first - but I think after a while people would stop caring so much about the lore as long as it somewhat fits and it keeps on coming.",

Launch plans haven't been released yet, but it'll probably include 3-4 maps, 6 family members (killers) and 5-6 victims, plus the inclusion of customization and progression which weren't available in the test.\n\n**There won't be anything from the other movies ever added to the game unless they secure additional rights down the line**, and the devs have indicated the goal for their game is to stay true to just the first movie, but they're totally free to add an endless amount of original maps, family members (killers) and victims, but no word on frequency. Price hasn't been announced yet either, but I wouldn't expect anything less than $40 tbh.\n\nProbably better to wait until closer to release when they release more info to be sure, or, yeah, just play it on Game Pass if you have it",

Weeks, sometimes months, would go by with not a word from him, but his reddit account was always commenting on knife, car, and watch subreddits.\n\nWhenever someone on the official forums had any kind of criticism to give, they'd drop a ban. When he finally did make an appearance on the subreddit, it was always dismissive and minimal language to explain a fix.\n\nHe eventually got either fired or moved, and a better person temporarily replaced him. Then that person vanished and got replaced, etc etc three or four times until Gun finally stopped updating altogether.\n\nMany individuals have never received Kickstarter rewards that were promised to them, as well such as Savini codes, and the artbooks. Gun is just an all-around awful company, and anyone would be smart to wait for the reviews on this one. They don't deserve any kind of trust.",

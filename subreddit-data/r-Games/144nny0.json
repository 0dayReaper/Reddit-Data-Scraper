The PSP version is better than P1 PSP, but they still changed some things to the point it is still not a substitute of the original.\n\nPersona 2: Eternal Punishment was localized okay-ish, but it's old and doesn't fit with Innocent Sin PSP localization. And the PSP version is the best of the PSP remasters AFAIK, but it wasn't localized.\n\nSo you basically can't play those games without some caveat. Which is a shame.",

It's pretty telling given this is going to be announced at the Xbox games showcase first, a western game show. 10 years ago you would have expected something like this to be TGS first with no English trailer at all.\n\nFinal Fantasy went from 13 being I think almost a year between WW and JP release to 15 being same day JP and WW. It seems like Sega/Atlus are going to follow same path. As they did with P5R and P5S. \n\nI mean that being said, I still don't think this would be an Xbox exclusive but I don't think we should think about Japan studios as they acted 10-20 years ago.",

So if they 'remake' Persona 3 without the female MC/the Portable content, those party members are outta luck.\n\nThat said, I think Persona 3 does a better job than 4 or 5 of having the other party members actually have their own stories and plot relevance, so Junpei still gets solid development even without a Social Link (although having one is much better). 4 and 5 feel more segmented - here's the Yukiko section, here's the Makoto section, etc.",

Which is 264 floors of mind numbing garbage where you're running looking for a stair case.\n\nAlso outside of the full moon events which are basically a small run to a boss, it's **the only non social content in the entire game**. Tartarus *is* the game. Meanwhile by the time you need to clear Mementos, you've played tons of dungeons that were unique and interesting, and are vastly more powerful than it requires.",

Yeah, sure, I'm down.\n\nHopefully they make some properly designed dungeons like P5's too; the endless boring corridors of Tartarus did not age well at all. They really should have the female MC in at as well. Sure, they'd have to make some different Social Link scenes, but if they're already remaking a massive game like this, what's a few more scenes that are 90% just unvoiced dialogue anyway?",

Would be a big miss not to include this content that was already created before.\n\nAt least we get full exploration, cutscenes (no sign of animated cutscenes yet though) and the ability to control party members (presumably) in one game.",

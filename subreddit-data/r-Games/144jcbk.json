That the game has co-op makes it even better! Very much looking forward to the game. \n\nDo prefer the more Calm, stoic, competent, professional Titus from Mark Strong in the original game from what we've seen so far, new version comes across more like a completely different character that isn't trying to be Titus.",

They're from a place called Ultramar.\n\n3. \"Ultramarine\" is the medieval Latin name for the vividly blue colored \"Lapis Lazuli\" mineral, which was at the time of the renaissance only found in Afghanistan; it came from \"over the sea\" or \"ultra marine\". Lapis Lazuli was crushed to make into vibrant blue paint... like the color of their armor. Sometimes a shade of blue paint resembling lapis lazuli is *called* ultramarine, and that's the paint recommended for painting minis of that chapter.",

There is no out-of-universe source stating that their belief is the *cause* of why Red is faster, what the codex actually says is \"Orks believe Red vehicles are faster. For some reason, Red vehicles tend to be faster\" - correlation does not imply causation.\n\nThe only time there has been a direct connection because the gestalt field and things like that, has been 2 biased in-universe mechanicus source speculating based on conjecture and with caveats. The first of these where the idea originated is outright said in the very same piece of lore to be unreliable and he even suggests a rational explanation, only to contradict what he just said and push his own theory named after himself. \n\nThe very, very original lore for \"Red One Go Faster\" back in Rogue Traders Waaagh the Orks gave a logical explanation for why Red Vehicles are faster, even.\n\nOrks being able to believe whatever they want into happening is meme lore, it's not actually the case for them.",

You're not meant to read every single book and know every bit of background detail, most 40k novels are meant to be read as standalone novels where the point is having a fun book to read. All that's really *meant* to be known by people into the setting is in Codexes. When people see the lore as the end in itself you get weird ideas like clonegrim and the daemonculaba being super important things and not just one off plot elements. They're consuming lore videos with details out of context.\n\nIt's also why you'll notice people who get into reading the books will transition into \"I want more fun ork books\", \"it'd be cool to see more well written admech novels) or similar because they're goal is to read something they enjoy not do homework.",

I love Warhammer and am well acquainted with the lore (be it 40K or Fantasy), but I just started out with Dawn of War back in the day and went from there. It's mostly just super cool mech suits, demons, tanks and whatnot fighting eachother and you'll get the vibe as you go along. \n\nIt's super accessible, and the core of each faction is real plain and simple that you'll immediately get the moment you hear their battlecries and grunts or see their obviously consistent and thematic aesthetics, but if you end up liking the atmosphere there's so much lore you can optionally dive into.",

This means it's quite easy to write for them.\n\n2. They're super-powerful. This easily means you can have them do ridiculous things in books and lore, and it still makes some degree of sense. This allows writers or developers to engage in power fantasies.\n\n3. From a tabletop point of view, their armies aren't too big, and they're quite easy to paint (at least the basic SMs). This has the advantage of not overwhelming people with way too many plastic minies, and making it relatively easy to paint up a sizable force.\n\nAs a T'au enjoyer, I can say that the little blue Space Communists are also pretty good, from a lore and story-telling perspective. They just lack the power fantasy part that Spesh Muhrines give you.\n\nThe Imperial Guard are just unwashed, unnamed masses being thrown into the grinder.\n\nEldars are ageless psykers, meaning they're harder to relate to, as characters.\n\nTyranids go \"nom\".\n\nOrks are fun and dakka is good, but they're quite intimidating to collect and paint, due to their large number of Boyz.\n\nThe Dark Eldar are kinky and not PG.\n\nAnd Chaos are all raving loons.",

It looks like this does too; we need more coop shooters, and the first game of this series got the feel and sound of the universe so correct, I have difficulty imagining they get this one wrong.",

This game has done a remarkable job holding back ANY of the Tyranids' higher grade monstrosities.  \n\n\nIn almost every trailer, we've only seen Gaunts and Warriors as the cannon fodder.  \n\n\nIt's incredibly exciting to see the danger of a Lictor foreshadowed.",

    "postText": "Hey reddit!  \nWe just announced Wild City, the new title we're working on!\n\nYou play as the mayor of a colorful town inhabited by cartoon creatures.  \nChoose to welcome citizens (add the to your deck), kick them out, and collect taxes by playing them!  \nIt's both cute and brutal... think of Cult of the Lamb or Happy Tree Friends.\n\nAs for the gameplay it basically plays as a mix of Slay the Spire (deckbuilding+progression) and Dorf Romantik (tile placement and adjacency mechanics).\n\nIt's still very early for us but we'll announce a demo soon, in the meantime you can wishlist it and join our Discord so you don't miss it!  \nSteam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2436970?utm\\_source=reddit",

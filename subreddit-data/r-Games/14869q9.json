Within just this article you have\n\n* Invasion bundle\n* Ultimate invasion bundle\n* Starter bundle\n* Ultimate hero collection\n* and the new battle pass\n\nThere were arguably more ways to spend money in this article than there were reveals of new content.",

            "comment": "In one of the bundles, it mentions \u201cPermanent access to Invasion Story Missions\u201d and it makes me curious of the implications of that. Are story missions now attached to the seasonal Battle Pass? Do you lose the ability to access the content after the season is over if you didn\u2019t buy it during the season? Will the pricing of the missions change in the seasons following their introduction?  \n  \nDepending on how this goes, it makes me think that they got rid of the skill-tree, single purchase version of PVE in favor for a handful of missions every now and then that they can more heavily monetize.",

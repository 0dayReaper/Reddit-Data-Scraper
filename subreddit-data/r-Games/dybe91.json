They've been coasting on love and respect they earned many years ago and I'm hoping they'll learn it's not unconditional. *It's been a looong time*, if you will. All I associate with them now is disappointment and frustration. They're like an abusive ex who sends you a text once a year to try and reel you back in.\n\nThey could bring me back with good games. But gaming is a lot different now than it was 10 years ago. I'd wish them goodluck but they can't \"fail\" anyways.",

In my opinion, the replacement VA was much worse. I wonder whether she's not doing voice acting anymore, or whether they've just been unable to contact her, since the majority of heroes had the same voice actor across every game.\n\nIt would be a bit of a letdown to have a full game focusing on a well-liked character, but not have her original voice.",

I believe this title is Valve dipping their toes in the water. I honestly don\u2019t really care if HL3 ever is a thing, but I do believe that we will see it eventually. I think Half-Life: Alyx is valve seeing if they can make a substantial single-player VR game, built from the ground up for VR, without feeling like a glorified tech demo. If we\u2019re going to see Half-Life 3, it probably won\u2019t be until VR is a lot more common and accessible to the public.",

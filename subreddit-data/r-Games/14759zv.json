    "postText": "**Learn Japanese RPG: Hiragana Forbidden Speech** is in Early Access on Steam for PC.  **Free demo** is also available!\n\n**Steam Page:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114950/Learn\\_Japanese\\_RPG\\_Hiragana\\_Forbidden\\_Speech?utm\\_source=indiesunday](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114950/Learn_Japanese_RPG_Hiragana_Forbidden_Speech?utm_source=indiesunday)\n\nWhen I was first learning Japanese, I really wanted a game like this. My frustration with other Japanese learning games is that while they teach hiragana (a Japanese alphabet) and vocabulary words, they rarely (if ever) use these learnings in actual conversations. Almost everything is out of context. A random character, word, or sentence here or there. On the other hand, trying to learn Japanese by watching anime or reading manga is overwhelming (for a beginner).\n\nI try to strike a balance between these two worlds.\n\nFirst, this game strives for **\u201cMild Immersion.\u201d** I want to immerse you in Japanese as much as possible, but only beginner Japanese. I want you to feel confident that any Japanese that comes your way is something you\u2019ve been taught and are capable of understanding at a basic level.\n\nSecond, this game also strives for **\u201cSmall Step Immersion.\u201d** I want to immerse you in Japanese one small step at a time. After learning a new hiragana, you will soon learn words spelled with that hiragana and immediately start seeing and hearing those words in dialogue. The game also teaches basic grammar. Slowly, but surely, your vocabulary and reading ability will grow as the game gently immerses you, more and more.\n\nThe game also features over 4000 lines of dialogue voiced by pro Japanese voice actors.\n\nPlease **wishlist** it on Steam!\n\nDMs or comments are welcome if you have questions.\n\nThanks!",

In fact, all through Early Access I haven't had any save-breaking changes. \n\nAdditionally, if you play the demo and later buy the full game, you can continue from your last save point in the demo.  Demo is about 2-3 hours long.",

The early stages of language learning can be very frustrating and confusing.  I tried to use my own frustration with other approaches to make this project something special, so I hope it will be fun and effective for your wife and many others!",

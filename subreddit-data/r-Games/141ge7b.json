    "postText": "I am a couple of months late but 3 years ago in Q1 2020, Xbox and Playstation revealed the technical details of their next generation consoles - the Xbox Series X (and S) and the PS5.\n\nOf course the full details like the look of the consoles (at least in PS5's case) and the pricing, launch titles and games in general, product ecosystem etc came later in the year, but by this time 3 years ago we knew the technical details about both consoles. \n\nI remember there being fierce discussion and conjecture devolving into console wars (as it often does) around this time regarding the capabilities of each system. \n\n3 years on, I'm curious about what people think about each console and whether each company has lived up to the promises made by them during the reveal stage. \n\nSome specific questions that I had are:\n\n1. What is audio like? Specifically, what is PS5's Tempest 3D audio like? Sony touted it as a major differentiator for this generation and Mark Cerny in particular seemed very passionate about it - has it lived up to the hype? Does it work with non-headphone output devices? Is it possible to generate customised HRTF profiles? And what of Xbox audio - while Xbox themselves didn't talk about audio much, I remember there being a lot of conjecture around it - is Xbox audio comparable to PS5s? \n\n\n2. Has the power difference made a, uh, difference? The Series X is more powerful than the PS5. During the last generation the PS4 being more powerful did make a difference in performance with some early gen games even running at a lower resolution on the Xbox. What has been the case this gen? \n\n\n3. Has the SSD made a difference? The PS5 having a faster SSD - has that made any noticeable difference? In terms of expandability - are drives for the PS5 affordable to purchase and easy to use? Have the Series X expansion drives gotten more affordable? \n\n\n\n4. How has the PS5's constant power-variable frequency approach worked out? I remember this being quite an interesting decision from Sony's design team, and they justified it by stating that it will allow them to operate the console at the same power draw, fan noise and heat generation for the entirety of the PS5's lifespan. Detractors stated that this would lead to performance drops in games and that Sony was doing this just to boost their teraflop numbers in comparison to Xbox. Do you find Sony's decision to be justified? Does the PS5 have a constant operating temperature and fan speed? \n\n\n\n5. Opinions on the Series S? Has it been sufficient for 'next gen'? Is it holding back 'next gen'? What has the experience been like? \n\n\n6. Have the haptic made a big difference? \n\n\n7. Any other thoughts or opinions on this console generation so far?",

Part of that is due to the pandemic delaying a lot of games, and another part of that is the fact that AAA game development has become way more complex and time consuming since 2013.\n\nAnother factor is the similarity of the new consoles to their predecessors. If your game is light on resources then making a version for both PS4 and PS5 is not nearly as time consuming as makinig PS3 and PS4 versions would have been back in 2015.\n\nGames *are* coming.\n\nThe real savior of this generation though has been *exceptional* backwards compatiblity. So many of my old PS4 games not only work on my PS5 but look and run considerably better.",

What exactly am I supposed to be excited for?\n\nThe FPS is the trailer looked kinda chunky at some spots, but did you see the trailer with FFXVI's combat? It kinda knocks it out of the park of displaying what feels like \"next-gen\", where the effects are approaching the realm of incredibly high budget CGI in movies. \n\nThat said, I do dislike the graphical approach going on. The best looking games in the past few years were like that because of art and world design that had to occur because of hard-ware limitations. Meanwhile the games that touting about how good they looked have came out ranging from mediocre to utterly terrible. \n\nGraphical fidelity just seems like more of a drain on resources than it should be in producing a good game. Like it's reaching the point where maybe that money would be better spent investing in more developers on the content side of things so games have more to do in them. Games looking good outside of artstyle approach is just going to be a constant moving target because eventually people get used to it, no matter how nice it looks.",

I'll focus on one:\n\nI think ray traced lighting is a huge deal, and you don't need to sacrifice 60 FPS on the consoles to get good results with it (See Fortnite's UE5 update).\n\nRemember how good the lighting in *Assassin's Creed Unity* looked in 2015? Doing that on last gen hardware required significant sacrifices. Lighting was all pre-calculated, so you couldn't have real day/night cycles. All that pre-calculated data took up a lot of storage space, and it made designing levels a very labor-intensive process because seemingly minor changes would often require the whole scene to be re-baked before you can see the results. The lighting was also static, so non-static objects like NPCs or the player are nigh impossible to light correctly with separate dynamic lighting.\n\nReal time path traced lighting gets us the same or better results, without all those drawbacks.",

Many of the games with performance RT modes end up not doing reflections at all, which IMO is the primary thing that makes ray tracing visually impressive. I'll take a crisp, 4k game with prebaked lighting over a blurry one whose lighting is technically impressive any day.\n\nI ended up playing through R&amp;C Rift Apart in the 1440p no-RT mode and honestly? I barely noticed a difference between the ray tracing and the prebaked lighting and that game was *made* to show off the PS5's features. Somewhat fancier lighting just isn't worth playing at 1080p.\n\nI could *maybe* see it becoming more important on a hypothetical PS5 Pro, but we're struggling to get 4k even on games without ray tracing so I suspect the focus would end up being on that. It's not going to be worth the performance hit until at least the PS6 imo, except in super visually simplistic games like Paradise Killer.",

I would imagine you mean more gimmicky, interactive environments, but that again isn't really a next gen thing; Dishonored 2 had plenty of extremely complicated levels. The reason most games don't is that it takes a ridiculous amount of effort. The only thing I could think of is gimmicks with rapidly changing environments, like Rift Apart, but even that game couldn't fit in that many of them. If you mean more detailed environments in terms of scene density and such, well... I would much rather have a clearer scene to view an environment through, even if that environment suffers a bit.\n\nPeople underplay how important graphics are in gaming. Resolution, sure, you can argue that beyond a certain minimum point it's a frivolity, but most people don't want to play games at 480p no matter how little they claim to care about graphics. And framerate is absolutely vital as it fundamentally changes the feel of most games",

Optimization and processing ability progress hand in hand with graphic fidelity. There is an ebb and flow as each goes through iterations but they both move forward at a steady pace.\n\nThis has been happening in the industry for the last 20 years, so no, it's not unlikely.\n\nWe're currently experiencing a weird transition between gens due in a large part to Covid along with some paradigm shifting software solutions like DLSS and Ray/Path tracing requiring very specific hardware which creates some bottlenecks. Those will be solved over time.\n\nAll this along with the fact the big optimization tech of this generation built into things like UE5 is only just now being utilized.\n\nYes, some companies are going to prioritize fast development over optimization while others will invest in a more long term approach. But again, that's always been the case.\n\n30fps used to be the gold standard. Now it's 60fps. Next gen it'll be higher.",

The jump in hardware performance was one of the best, but developers decided they didn't want to lose sales from last-gen's player base. This meant leveraging engines and techniques that simply would never take advantage of the hardware gain. This meant bespoke, poorly optimized RT and UE4 quirks. UE5 is a tremendous engine, capable of things UE4 can't be pushed to achieve. The last generation just needs to be sunset.",

I think you might be referring to the game keeping it's save state in memory (probably on the hard drive, tbh) when you powered down and yes that was cool, but only having one \"slot\" for it basically meant it just saved me a minute or so of loading when I first launched, which I usually did while doing pre-game prep of getting water and going pee. Now I do all that and the game is just sitting there waiting for me which is...better I guess, but it didn't change my personal relationship to thing.

I don't think the resume features suffered that problem. You're right that reading data from storage takes time, but dumping 8 GB from the HDD to RAM shouldn't take more than a few seconds and that's...basically how long it took. It was never *instant*, just super fast. If it was instant then I'd think it was stored in RAM.",

That works by keeping the game in RAM and the console powered on but in a low-power state, it doesn\u2019t store it on the hard drive. Reading 8 GB from the hard drive takes around 1.5 minutes on the PS4, it\u2019s a 5400rpm spinning drive that does around 100 MB/s sequential. (And external drives can\u2019t be faster even if you use an SSD, the bottleneck is the USB 2.0 port.) If it only took a few seconds you\u2019d never have the minute-long loading times you do often get. \n\nThe Nintendo Switch works the same way. The reason the PS4 takes that few seconds to start and the Nintendo Switch doesn\u2019t is because the PS4 OS is programmed to power the hard drive on and spin it up to full speed before resuming, in case the game wants to quickly stream assets from it. They *could* program it to instantly resume like the Switch does, but if the game you\u2019re resuming tries to load something from the drive within that window (and it\u2019s very common for games like Horizon to be constantly loading things in) it\u2019ll create janky looking problems, anything from the game totally freezing for a few seconds to unrendered textures or objects popping in and potentially even crashes depending on how the game was written. Games expect the hard drive to be spun up and ready so the PS4 waits until it is, even though the sleep mode function itself doesn\u2019t use the hard drive.\n\nThe new modes on the Series X (I haven\u2019t got a PS5 yet but I think it supports this too?) do use the storage drive and that\u2019s why they work for multiple games at once and can survive unplugging the console. Sometimes I hear this called \u201chibernation\u201d to distinguish it from the RAM-only \u201csleep.\u201d",

The fact that you don't need to be tethered makes the Q2 feel as advanced as higher quality wired sets IMO (And you can always plug it into a PC to get the performance needed for PCVR games)",

I've seen games with *elements* that can't run on PS4 (like Rift Apart's portals mechanic, or Burning Shores' final boss), and I've seen plenty of games that certainly benefit from the new hardware in order to run more smoothly and look prettier. But I haven't yet seen a single game - NOT ONE - where I felt \"Oh yeah, that's just way too much for the PS4 to handle even if you downscale the framerate and graphical fidelity\". Obviously I don't know how the development process of each individual games went, so I'm probably factually wrong, but this is more about emotions than fact. I haven't found a game that FEELS next-gen yet. \n\nContrast this with last-gen, where were getting truly next-gen experiences pretty much from the get-go. AC Unity released only a year after next-gen and it truly felt like a leap forward not only in graphical fidelity and presentation, but in its very gameplay. I can't imagine that game ever running on PS3 even if you significantly gimp it graphically, not in the way it was designed at least. And that's just one example, there were plenty of games that truly felt next-gen, while the cross-gen games felt like they were already being outdated (Watch\\_Dogs comes to mind).\n\nBut most new releeases for the last 3 years were cross-gen, and as late as a few months ago we were still getting big-budget AAA games that released for both PS4 and PS5 (and thus nothing about them felt next-gen at all). I'm hoping that FFXVI's release will mark the turning point where next-gen only will become the norm, but even if it does, it's a bummer that this will happen 3 years into the generation. Hell, we're apparently getting a PS5 Pro next year despite the fact that there's barely anything out there to challenge the current PS5.",

It just looks/feels like a super charged PS4 game  (fully aware the speed of traversal is not possible on PS4, needs more than that to feel next gen though). \n\n&gt; Contrast this with last-gen, where were getting truly next-gen experiences pretty much from the get-go.\n\nI didn't really feel this until Battlefield 1 in 2016. That game had incredible sound design and vast highly detailed landscapes compared to PS3 gen. All around it was a giant leap compared to similar games from the prior generation.

Whether it's early SNES games compared to NES or early PS4 games compared to PS3, the leap is ALWAYS noticeable. Like, you can't tell me that you didn't notice the stark jump in quality between, say, Super Mario World 2 (1995) and Super Mario 64 (1996). You can say the same for most gens (for example, Final Fantasy IX in 2000 vs FFX in 2001, GIGANTIC leap). The claim that a noticeable leap in game quality as generations change is \"just not often a thing\" is very false.\n\n&gt;the fact that rift apart featured a central plot point around the ability to use the SSD for fast loading just flies in the face of your entire argument.\n\nHave you played Rift Apart? Outside of one sequence near the beginning of the game where Ratchet is flung through multiple dimensions, the concept of rifts doesn't really use the hardware to its full potential. For the most part rifts serve as just portals that can instantly transport you from one place on the map to another if you hookshot into them, which was already a thing that Portal figured out in 2007 on PS3-level hardware.",

I think even keeping visual parity with last gen with the likes of Horizon and doubling the frames is my preference, but I'm okay with leaving it to the studios to decide.

It was touted to have visual parity with Series X but with lower resolution, which was a pipe dream from day 1. I was hoping at least that having two consoles would improve scalability for PC since studios would already need to accommodate the Xbox, but this has definitely not been the case.\n\nIt's cheap, I get that, but the marketing was completely overblown and studios have not been able to get current gen games on it without substantial compromises.

And I don't think there have been enough high quality first party games on Xbox to really take advantage of the X's performance. \n\nDifferent story on the PS5. I'm loving just about every first party title and the power increase is made obvious by the contrast to my Switch. Switch used to be good. Now it's bad to fine.\n\n&gt; Has the SSD made a difference?\n\nBig time. SSDs have been around for a long time but developers didn't create games around them because consoles didn't have them. Now they are and I hope they never go back. Low load times are awesome and allow for clever tricks like we see in God of War Ragnar\u00f6k or Ratchet and Clank.\n\n&gt; Opinions on the Series S?\n\nI don't personally have one (or an X for that matter) because I have a PC. Xbox made an interesting decision when they made PC basically the same as an Xbox. I know PC players are still the minority, but it also means I don't get much of an opinion on the consoles.\n\nStill, I wouldn't say the S is holding back next gen. The focus for game developers is on PS5/Series X. My understanding is it's not difficult to get games running on the S. \n\nAlso, if anything is holding back next gen on the Xbox side, it's not the consoles, it's the lack of big games.\n\n&gt; Have the haptic made a big difference?\n\nLess than I thought it would. It's not utilized to the degree I'd hoped. Astrobot remains the coolest experience with the haptics though.\n\nPSVR2 might change my opinion on that, though I don't see a big reason to buy one.\n\n&gt; Any other thoughts or opinions on this console generation so far?\n\nI had hoped we'd all get away from \"console wars\" and grow up, but Xbox seems to keep shooting themselves in the foot while PS5 is showing up with great games. It's honestly annoying that that's still the story.",

            "comment": "&gt;What is audio like? Specifically, what is PS5's Tempest 3D audio like? Sony touted it as a major differentiator for this generation and Mark Cerny in particular seemed very passionate about it - has it lived up to the hype? Does it work with non-headphone output devices? Is it possible to generate customised HRTF profiles? And what of Xbox audio - while Xbox themselves didn't talk about audio much, I remember there being a lot of conjecture around it - is Xbox audio comparable to PS5s?\n\nI tried out the Tempest tech, but didn't get much use out of it. It seemed more of a gimmick than anything else at the end of the day. It also worked only with headphones out of the box, but it's been updated to work with speakers now. I use a 5.1 setup (soundbar with two satellite rear speakers) for what it's worth.\n\n&gt;Has the power difference made a, uh, difference? The Series X is more powerful than the PS5. During the last generation the PS4 being more powerful did make a difference in performance with some early gen games even running at a lower resolution on the Xbox. What has been the case this gen?\n\nSeries X and PS5 power differences haven't been too different for me to notice at the end of the day. Some games run better XSX, others PS5. I've not directly compared anything side by side myself, I usually just go where Digital Foundry says the framerate is more stable even if the resolution might be lower. If equal, I go to Xbox for single player, PS5 for multiplayer, with some exceptions.\n\n&gt;Has the SSD made a difference? The PS5 having a faster SSD - has that made any noticeable difference? In terms of expandability - are drives for the PS5 affordable to purchase and easy to use? Have the Series X expansion drives gotten more affordable?\n\nBig difference with SSDs. Games loading nearly instantly versus 30 seconds or so on HDD, better load times, it's great. PS5's drives are more affordable but they're a little harder to install, and you have to do a small bit of homework on what's compatible and know if it has a heatsink and all that. It's not hard to do, but someone not tech savvy may get intimidated.  Compare that to the Series X cards, where it's just plug and play. They're more expensive but more convenient at that, although I'd say the price is excessive for that convenience. \n\n&gt;How has the PS5's constant power-variable frequency approach worked out? I remember this being quite an interesting decision from Sony's design team, and they justified it by stating that it will allow them to operate the console at the same power draw, fan noise and heat generation for the entirety of the PS5's lifespan. Detractors stated that this would lead to performance drops in games and that Sony was doing this just to boost their teraflop numbers in comparison to Xbox. Do you find Sony's decision to be justified? Does the PS5 have a constant operating temperature and fan speed?\n\nI've not noticed any real problems or advantages to this tbh. I'm sorry, I'm kind of an idiot and can't answer this. For what it's worth I rarely if never hear either system's fans, whereas my PS4 Pro could have sent a pirate ship to sea with it's fan.\n\n&gt;Opinions on the Series S? Has it been sufficient for 'next gen'? Is it holding back 'next gen'? What has the experience been like?\n\nI have no experience with the Series S. I have a decently sized collection of XB1, 360, and original Xbox games that are backwards compatible, so I felt it wouldn't be the right fit for me. From what I know though, some games that run worse on Xbox do so because there are basically two different SKUs for the Xbox versions of games. I don't think the Series X is holding back next gen though, but I think Microsoft should have just did what Sony did with the digital only PS5, even if it would have cost another $100.\n\n&gt;Have the haptic made a big difference?\n\nI feel like I might be in a minority, but I hate the haptic triggers in most situations. The better vibration is nice, and I appreciated in Returnal how a half-press may do one thing while a full-press would do something else. Sort of like some Gamecube games would work.  So far though, I've found most games just use the haptic triggers to make it marginally harder to shoot in games. Switching from PS4 CoD BOCW to PS5, I had to disable the haptics just because I'd shoot just slower enough to die more.\n\n&gt;Any other thoughts or opinions on this console generation so far?\n\nWell, the first few years have just felt like the previous generation remastered. Better framerates and resolutions in games released a few years prior. Fine by me tbh. My graphics card in my PC can't handle raytracing, but seeing it on PS5 &amp; Series X has been pretty amazing. Watch Dogs Legion has a lot of problems, but the rain-soaked London streets and the reflections in the puddles are really nice to look at.  I also appreciate having Freesync in my games, since my TV can handle it and games feel a lot smoother when it's implemented well.",

It's not a generation that really impresses in any meaningful way, the new tech mostly boils down to nice QOL improvements that do make gaming better, but don't really blow you away as the marketing and the fanboys would like you to believe it does. \n\nAnd while I do believe that we will see more games showcasing impressive stuff in the next coming years. It's really not a \"now\" situation and we don't even know if those machines will even be the target when they do actually release. \n\nAnother point that I'm not particularly fond of, is the dumbing down of games that we saw starting last gen and is continuing now. The amount of hand-holding and just overall simplification that we are seeing in the AAA space, both in the mechanics as in the plot and overall gaming structure is just sad. Especially because the technical gap between AA/Indies and AAA is extremely large, so even with those games still carrying the torch in that regard, they don't really have the resources to do that while also using the new tech in an impressive way.",

The graphical leap isn't substantial enough for me to justify getting either console when it feels like a better investment is a better PC. None of the new features really entice me much. The dual sense features are kind of neat, but ultimately not a must have for me.\n\nAnother reason is that new games don't feel next gen right now. For me, it's a bit like \"OOO that's pretty\" and then the game can't hold my attention. Pair that with a wholehearted embracing of battle passes, poor release performance, and  increased base price for these games, it just doesn't seem worth it. Multiple friends of mine have pretty much let their PS5 consoles become a once per week boot up for the same games they've been playing machine. I don't really know anyone that bought the latest Xbox, though I can't see it having much of a leg up against the PS5 with its exclusives. \n\nLike others have said, that might change in the future with new releases. I'm personally not too hyped or invested, but I want to be. Cautiously optimistic maybe?",

PS5 seems to have the best use of features with their audio and haptics being really good when utilized but what I usually enjoy seeing most between generations is a jump in graphical fidelity. This time it just isn\u2019t very big. \n\nThe biggest disappointment is their inability to deliver on the trifecta of graphics nowadays: high frame rate, ray tracing, and high resolutions. \n\nThey just don\u2019t seem capable of delivering on all three of these at once. They seem to be in a \u201cpick two\u201d situation where you can chose to have high fps and ray tracing but low resolution, or ray tracing and high resolution but low fps. Sometimes it\u2019s only one they can deliver where you can chose to have either 60fps(at 1080p without RT) , ray tracing (at 30fps and 1080p), or 4K (at 30fps and no RT). They were selling these machines as next gen ray tracing machines but the reality is that they can\u2019t really do this without a lot of compromises. In that way I\u2019m underwhelmed by this generation. \n\nAlso games like Tears of the Kingdom have really brought into focus that I don\u2019t even need ray tracing: I just want good art design, and good game design. PS5 and XBOX are so focused on giving the best graphical fidelity (that they can\u2019t even fully deliver) that they\u2019re not focusing on innovating with great game design. I want them to focus on that for awhile and see what they come up with. Nintendo spanked them hard in the creativity department.",

I'd love to hear more on this point from others' experiences\n\n1. I've not played any Xbox, but my assumption is the answer to this question is \"no the power disparity between xbox and playstation has not made a difference\" - there have been a number of discussions around how lackluster most people have felt about the xbox first-party titles, and generally I agree, so without any significant titles taking advantage of the extra power I think most people would say no to this question. I mention first-party titles specifically because developers publishing on more than one platform are going to be doing feature-parity exercises to ensure the game runs relatively the same on both consoles so in my mind these are unlikely candidates to take advantage of one console being more powerful\n\n1. The improved storage on the PS5 has made a big difference in my experience, my loadtimes in Bloodborne or God of War are barely noticeable if I look back through my memory and instead I remember loving those games. I imagine many answers will range from \"yes\" to \"Very yes\" on this point which should be no surprise to anyone with computer science background knowledge around how time-expensive any storage action is\n\n1. I have no clue on this point so again I'm more interested to hear what people think about the power usage you've mentioned, I hadn't heard about it at all pre-launch either so I've got nothing to add here\n\n1. The Series S devices are supposed to be technologically-weaker consoles than the PS5 or Series X devices but at a more acceptable price point, right? Has it been sufficient for next-gen, let's hear from folks who have actually used it here but in my opinion yes it has held things back but it didn't do so alone: IMO the generation has been held back by hardware fragmentation. First-party exclusives might move consoles in reddit game fans' minds, but multiple platform releases is the standard for your average consumer and that's difficult for a lot of companies because they're not developing for 2 platforms (\"PC\"/xbox or playstation), they're developing for SIX platforms: switch, PC, xbox X, xbox S, PS4, **AND** PS5 (7 with mobile too) all of which have different hardware capabilities\n\nThat's a lot of effort for companies to ensure a consistent game experience for their customers. In future generations I hope we ditch this style of device ecosystem, I understand why we got here, but I don't think it worked out as well as if devs had fewer options to build for. IMO companies tried to do something similar in the past but this time around didn't succeed as much compared to past efforts like the 360 Arcade, which was a cheaper pricepoint for consumers achieved through less-good accessories and peripherals, but it was still fundamentally the same console so no extra work was made for devs\n\n6. Haptic feedback in the PS5 controller IS FRICKIN' AWESOME. It makes a HUGE difference in your gameplay, spend fifteen minutes with it in Astro's Playroom or Demon's Souls (PS5) and you'll know right away that it's really cool. Now did this make a difference in the video game ecosystem in general? Not in my opinion. This was my first ever Sony console so I took advantage of the backwards compatibility to play a lot of PS4 games, especially since they handed me a big library of their greatest hits for owning a PS5 so unfortunately I didn't get a ton of PS5-only games, but generally, I haven't seen a lot of dev uptake on this feature. Very unfortunate that something like Elden Ring didn't do so but not surprising, see my previous points on how much work there already is to ensure a game works well on all the consoles one is releasing for\n\n1. Finally, IDK what happened to my numbering list formatting \ud83d\ude02 sorry!",

I don't know if devs need to do some extra work to use the feature or something but I don't see significant differences between my pc and ps5 on more recent games.\n\nThe haptic feedbacks on the ps5 are soo good, but they make my hands tingle in the long run, so I had to turn it off. Also the ps5 controller is probably the most uncomfortable controller since the n64. My hands hurts if I play more than an hours on the ps5, the handles are just too big I think or not in the right angle to accomodate the joysticks being so far.\n\nSo yea, I regret buying a ps5, I think I played a total of 4 games on it and I don't see myself booting it up in the foreseeable future.",

            "comment": "Speaking from the PS5 perspective, it's worth it so far. I got it two years after launch, so maybe that helped since I had quite a few quality games to catch up on (Demon's Souls, Returnal, Ratchet, Astro Playroom, etc.).\n\nIt definitely isn't an insane jump like PS2 to PS3, but the emphasis on 60 FPS so far has been nice. I hope it continues, but I can see companies reverting back to their ways to shove as much shiny graphics as they can into these units.\n\nSSD integration is nice and you can really feel how much more responsive everything is compared to the older spinning disk drives in use prior. \n\nThe memory expansion (in my opinion) is an overall better solution for the consumer for the PS5. YEs, the Xbox solution is easier to install, but is MUCH more expensive now due to having a proprietary connection compared to the generic M.2 slot for the PS5. Only thing users need to be concerned about is using a drive with enough speed, and being able to slide a panel off and doing one single screw for the drive.\n\nController for PS5 is a nice improvement. Bigger, haptics are sweet and the overall shape is more pleasing (to me). Xbox is more of the same that they've done for basically a decade now. Heck even longer if you include the Xbox 360 concept. If it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess. I personally wished that they would try to add something though.\n\nMy only real main worry is how the Xbox Series S will last in the long run. Console gens typically last like 7 years or so, so I wonder how much will need to be sacrificed by third party devs to be able to function on that console as games become higher in fidelity and complexity.\n\nI am not saying it is singularly holding gaming back, but releasing a weaker console on purpose was certainly a choice by Microsoft.",

A shame if so and hopefully they can work out a solution.\n\nSome exciting and cool hits are coming this year however like Starfield and Spider-Man 2, hopefully they\u2019re really fun!\n\nHopefully Spider-Man 2 because the release date wasn\u2019t mentioned, isn\u2019t delayed again, but personally, the textures and animations looked a little messy and rushed and might need one.",

Sony is showing a pattern of whinging up their line up for hardware launches and then doing the bare minimum in support. They\u2019re canceling games instead of getting them out the door and taking risks. They\u2019re not willing to invest in their platform, expecting us to bear the burden of the risk of their attempted platform building (Dreams failure, PSVR1 abandoned). \n\nThere is no reason to have given Sony another $600 at this point. And we all know that they\u2019re gonna launch a PS5 slim next year alongside a bunch of their studios announcing games to push it as being necessary, despite the PS5 still not being necessary. And those games they\u2019ll spend the next five years trickling out with logos that lead to cinematic that lead to falsely marketed feature sets that change in a blog post right before launch. \n\nAnd then you have this generations pheromone on of Capcom and Blizzard launching their games without reviewers seeing their monetization strategies so they aren\u2019t part of the reviews, preventing customers from making informed purchases decisions. And evry company in existence is suddenly expecting us to be happy with procedurally generated content, AI artwork, and working for free as \u201ccontent creators\u201d to build levels and full features games for them without any revenue sharing plans or even discussions (Dreams, Everywhere, Fortnite). These guys also brag about having small companies and low employee counts. Meanwhile, paid content is being dumped from live service games and not carried over to forced sequels once the sales start slowing down.\n\nYea, this generation is shit and filled with genuine criminal fraud.",

            "comment": "PS5 has been solid, though a little underwhelming. They've been wrapping up most of their big franchises that made the PS4 what it was - so we're still waiting to see what games will truly define the PS5 generation. Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank, Demons Souls and Horzon Burning Shores have shown the graphical capability of the console, but I imagine it will still be a few years out before we get our hands on a new Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica release.\n\nXbox has been dismal on all fronts, from first party games, delays, cancellations, and even 3rd party support despite having an edge in hardware. They're trapped in a vicious cycle of hardware sales being low, which translates to games sales being low, which then translates to developers and publishers being less inclined to focus their development on the console, which in turn leads to less releasing on the platform, less sales, less interest, etc.\n\nDespite Phil Spencer's comments, Xbox really just needs some must play AAA games on their platform. Its been 15 years since a great game made its way exclusively to the Xbox and it doesn't really look like that streak is going to be broken soon.",

            "comment": "PlayStation 5 is a fantastic console. The audio, the graphics, the SSD fast loads, and even the controller are all great. The console exclusive games like Returnal and Ratchet Rift Apart showcase the console really well. But the problem is, that's really the only two new console exclusive games. Most other PS5 exclusives are either great remakes or directors cut of PS4 exclusives. There's not much new content.\n\nAs for the Xbox Series X, I dunno what I can say about it. The controller fine but just a bit too clicky. I don't think I've played a game that showcases the XSX's power. Speaking of games, that's one thing Xbox is lacking. Not games in general, they definitely have hundreds and hundreds on it. But in terms of console only titles, I honestly can't think of any. And honestly, can't think of much Xbox exclusives in the past 3 years other than Hi Fi Rush, Redfall, Halo Infinite and Forza Horizon 5. Xbox's output of exclusives is quite lacking compared to PlayStation's.\n\nAt the moment, PS5 is the far superior console as there's just not much of a reason to get an XSX while there is a reason to buy PS5. The while small but fantastic console exclusives is one. The fast loads is another. The controller is also another. Oh, and the console is quiet. That's a pretty good reason.",

I skipped out on the last gen sans Switch, so getting to go through the PS4 catalogue during which even Insomniac famously went \"it's fine if our flagship Ratchet title is 30fps\" and play through all those games on PS5 at 60fps (sans Bloodborne) has been a real treat. All the extra graphical bells and whistles haven't amounted to much, but they never do. It's just great to have responsive AAA games again.",

I was supposed to be out of town for a bachelor party but ended up changing my plans and left the party around 10. Was talking with my gf pretty frequently throughout the night and then all of sudden, she was bombed and could hardly talk. I ended up hightailing it to the bar that she was at and nearly threw hands with a bouncer that had 100 lbs. on me because there was a line and $10 cover that I was absolutely going to bypass to get in. I ended up not getting in but saw a coworker of hers (she was out with coworkers) and he helped bring her to the door where I basically carried her to the car and home. My blood still boils when I think about that night and that if I hadn\u2019t made an uncharacteristic decision to bail on the bachelor party, something terrible would have happened to the person I care about most in life.",

It\u2019s an odd clash of culture\u2026 computer science was mainly pursued by niche nerd pursuits and international (Indian/ Asian) students who kept to their  own circles. In absence of \u201cnormies\u201d in their arenas they believe they have a superior talent that other just couldn\u2019t keep up with because computer science is totally a high IQ, savant major to pursue, bjt the reality is everyone knows information science and computer science are where the money is at and lots of non-obsessive fandom types who have no respect for that type of subculture are going to become increasingly common in their worlds\u2026 it comes as a shock \u201cWHAAAAT! A NORMIE IS CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING RELATIONAL DATABASES AND DISCRETE MATHEMATICS?!?!\u201d\n\nI kept my opinion to myself but I always wanted to sass back at them and be like \u201cyou stupid fucking under developed bitchass, stinky mother fuckers. You are not enlightened because you understand all the meta of the Pokemon games, anyone can learn that shit, millions of children learn it every year. You are not special because you read rage comic panels before they hit Facebook. You are mentally immature and under developed in core adult competencies and put too much of your time into tribal \u201cgamer\u201d lifestyle cliches.",

A lot of the stuff I heard that wasn\u2019t directed at me specifically was stuff directed at any poor woman who happened to be in there instead, and the fan base seems pretty young and immature in general, so they\u2019re often even worse because they\u2019ve never known consequences for any of this misogynistic shit.\n\nI\u2019m gonna wean myself off it, but I\u2019d already decided not to play OW2 because of all the bullshit changes they\u2019re making anyway.

This is the actual sexism:\n\n\"One of the Blizzard employees first asked if she was lost, another one asked if she was at the conference with her boyfriend, and another one asked if she even knew what pentesting was.\"\n\nSexism: prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.\n\nThat is my issue with them focusing on that aspect of it solely because its sensational and a \"dirty joke\" but they clearly were prejudice toward her knowledge and qualifications just because she was a female. Which is the more fucked up part IMO, not some nerd making a stupid joke based off her shirt. The jokes are disgusting but the prejudice is infuriating.",

Nowadays I keep a professional distance from everyone, I don't want friends in the workplace.\n\nMy point is, companies can't function like this. Colleagues just have to be professional to each other. They might think they're creating a fun working environment by behaving like this, but it gets out of hand really fast and there is a difference between being 'victim' of a joke or the butt of all jokes.\n\nI think Blizzard's situation began somewhat like this and progressed from a few sex jokes and comments between friends to this shitshow.",

I went through the BfA expansion and they had no shits to give about telling the story in any coherent way. All quest lines were disconnected, even if the story beats were supposed to happen in a certain order. You could reach a whole zone that was supposed to happen after a raid before you even completed the part of the plot that led up to the raid.\n\nFull disclosure, I play FFXIV and so I'm used to a very linear main story, but like... goddamn.

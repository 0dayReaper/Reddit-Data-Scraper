It is pretty much perfectly suited for the X-com gameplay style and loop.\n\nYou could start off as a small tribe with basic weapons and a few troops. And then you start expanding out with the more territory you capture the more you can produce advanced weapons and armor for your tribe. And you could face a variety of opponents, with low-risk, low-reward battles against raiders. Or tough battles against groups like the Brotherhood of Steel where can get rarer equipment and perhaps Power Armor. All the while antagonist factions also grow in power.\n\nAnd it leads to a nice variety of troop times. The setting already has animal and robot companions, stealth technology and heavy armor. Not to mention potential rare recruits like super mutants. \n\nHonestly, the more I think about it, I think Fallout might be better suited to a X-com style game than even an alien invasion.",

It's just unfortunate that it wasn't really what people were expecting -- I know I went into it expecting Marvel XCOM, and I ended up getting Marvel Slay the Spire, with Marvel Fire Emblem between missions. Not what I expected, not what I wanted, but when I accepted it for what it was, I had to admit it was really good.\n\nWould an XCOM game have sold better? Hard to say. Midnight Suns has its license to carry it, but ironically, after Avengers, that license might well be toxic.\n\nEither way, while I'd like a new XCOM game, I *am* glad we have Midnight Suns too.",

But the core gameplay was there to potentially be a success. I hope to see something similar but in a different setting in the future (from whichever studio takes that risk).",

If you give me a cast of 12 characters, force me to build up only a few, then focus on making me play as all of them, your game requires low power growth to be balanced. Rather than the exponential power growth you get in any turn based game ever, we ended up with a 10 card hero's with certain characters feeling borderline pointless. \n\nI played with mods to accelerate all aspects of the economy at a certain point, and even then it felt way too slow. And the social aspect of the game did not respect my time. I want 10 minutes of good writing, not 2 hours of absolute filler. \n\nInstead of an all time classic we got a minor cult classic for those with interests in turn based, third person puzzle, marvel, and social aspects. \n\nThe worst thing is it was still good despite these insane flaws, so if they'd just applied better game design choices it would have been globally amazing.",

Were people excited to play Star-Lord or were they looking for Chris Pratts Star-Lord? The cast isn't star power like Iron-Man, Thor and Captain America and even those had some complaints of not being the movie VAs.\n\nCombine this with the $60 price tag you run into some problems. The dedicated fan base of GotG was small with the team used in the movies (which was written by Dan Abnett,...) even being \"replaced\" right as the movies came out. It expect they aren't really targeting that small fanbase with a game in 2021, but they also don't target the MCU fan group due to outright saying its not the MCU ones.\n\nI would say its a great game that many would buy at a 50-75% discount rather than full price and it has had a long tail with sales as a result (the last 30 days has the highest player average since it released). Thats also highlighted because the game has done better than Avengers in the long run. On steam it sits at 94% recommened with more reviews in total.",

It\u2019s not about the \u201ccards\u201d metaphor, it is about where the random generation of numbers (RNG) occurs. \n\nIn Xcom you move your units to places around the map and take actions. Those actions have a percentage chance to work, but they\u2019re always available to you. You can plan 10-20 turns ahead in Xcom. The action economy is about spending your tactical moves wisely across the long strategy of the encounter.\n\nIn Midnight Suns, the RNG is moved to the actions you have available each turn. That means you can move a character somewhere and not have the action you need. Or, as it works in practice, you can only plan to move a character as many turns ahead as you have cards this turn. The action economy is about managing the output of your randomly available options each turn.\n\nThe two games are fundamentally different. The cards aren\u2019t the problem for Xcom fans. It\u2019s ok that Midnight Suns is it\u2019s own thing, but it\u2019s not a satisfying tactical strategy game just because it has a grid.",

Midnight suns is a big financial investment for someone who has no idea if they'll like 100+ hours of turn based card battling.\n\nIt's too bad, as much as I'm not a marvel fan, I really enjoyed this game and getting to play a \"AAA\" style big budget turn based RPG. \n\nAs much as I'm wanting XCOM 3, I enjoyed Midnight Suns and I'm glad it was made.",

I also recall it launched in a somewhat busy period which didnt help matters.

You just have to look at the shitty Activision tie-ins from ages ago to see that even though the brand will carry it so far, it won't poft it to the heights Sony has seen with the past two titles.",

I know several for myself that just show up every few months at a theater to see a superhero movie. It's not a big investment.\n\nFor the streaming shows, well, because of how the human brain works they don't feel like they're \"paying\" for those shows. It also feels like a small investment to turn their brains off and binge some show every month. Something to talk about at work.\n\nBut for a game you need to spend money for it explicitly. It's not a tradition. I can also speak from personal experience that, for whatever reason, most people I know under 30 have long since stopped giving a shit about superheroes. My boss in his 60's never stops talking about what's out but my friends and I just don't really care anymore.\n\nGames tend to appeal to people under the age of 40. 50 at max. Even then it's young adults that really power the 60$ game market. So when that group doesn't care then it doesn't matter how many tickets Marvel Movie X sold, the game won't.",

Midnight suns is 'sorta' a card game and 'sorta' a hanging out with heroes thing but it still doesn't really explain it so it scares off anyone who isn't into Firaxis games or into some comic arc called 'Midnight Suns' which is a terrible name as it doesn't tell you who the heck is in it unless you've read it.  Sad thing was it wasn't a cheap game by any means, it just had no way to market this passion project as strategy/super heroes isn't a popular genre (marvel snap is trying but its F2P) and likely scared most people away.",

If you have a counter example I'd be interested.\n\nIf you're just trying to say the layoffs are for the express purpose of increasing profits for the people who own the company, well, yes. That's not a secret, they're literally legally obligated to do that and frequently release reports that are basically titled \"here is a status update on the state on your pockets\"",

Their shares in companies are not directly owned by them but by the clients of theirs whose money the are investing. \n\nI guess in a sense it could sort of be lining the pockets of Vangaurd and Blackrock because those firms charge a management fee so if they stocks go up they do make more money. Most money goes into the hands of casual investors (think a lot of 401Ks and such). \n\nBelieve it or not, firms are not always just interested in a quick buck. They do look forward and are looking for sustainable ways to grow revenue or reduce costs. At the end of the day, we're seeing a period of contraction in the economy and especially so in the tech sector. That's going to mean that companies that grew with the economy are likewise going to contract a bit via layoffs.",

And I find the writing by far not as 'cringe', as a lot of people have described it. \n\nBut that's just me. I'm sad the game didn't sell well. I'd love nothing more than a season pass 2, and/or a sequel.",

That's the general consensus I've heard when XCOM fans are continually disappointed to not hear any news coming down the pipeline year after year -- but Civilization keeps on trucking. Granted it's a world renowned IP compared to XCOM, but still.",

And the enemies lacked any _real_ variation. You need way more variation in enemies for a tactical game like that.\n\nWhen you factor in the Marvel tax, I can imagine it was not good on a balance sheet.",

Has a chromed left cyberarm that looks a lot like the one pictured but otherwise looks more like David Bowie in the drawing. In 2020 he had a hacker girlfriend named Alt, but it also says he has a history of messy breakups.",

In the past, a lot of these sorts of cameos would just be an easy payday for the actors, but it seems more and more actors are actually interested and invested in video game projects.\n\nEdit: yes I'm well aware that the games industry makes more money than movies. I'm talking about the perception of working on a game as a noteworthy and prestigious endeavour for actors vs. working in film or television.",

            "comment": "Theres a secret message from a SSH-Server you can connect to:\n\nFinally, after months of preparation, we can share with you two big things we have been hard at work on \u2014 CP2077's cinematic story trailer and a brand new gameplay demo! Yes, yes, we know \u2014 for now, the demo is only available to the lucky ones who managed to get tickets to E3 and the rest of you will have to wait until gamescom or the public dev Q&amp;A unveiling stream at PAX in August. Yeah, we can already feel the bashing you're gonna give us online :(. \"Why are you not treating us fair\", \"why is the gameplay not being released right away?\". The reason is we want to make the most out of the months of work we put into the demo and first showcase gameplay live at E3 and gamescom. Releasing gameplay right away would make the gamescom presentations pointless and would significantly limit our chance to build hype. Why do we need to build hype? To get more gamers interested in CP2077 and, hopefully, convince them to give it a go. We are putting our hearts and souls into making CP2077 a great game and we would like as many gamers as possible to find out about it and experience its amazing story. Also, hype can turn into sales (after all, we are not a charity), and good sales allow us to grow, take creative risks and deliver new, great games for you to enjoy.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about one more super important announcement \u2014 the release date. Less than a year from now, on April 16th, 2020, you\u2019ll finally be able to sink your teeth into Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nAs you probably noticed, we prepared 2 editions of the game. Why only two? Because when we pre-order ourselves, we don\u2019t like to go to Wikipedia to compare content. We have a simple deal: there\u2019s the standard edition, the one we think most gamers will choose, and a limited Collector\u2019s Edition. While we're pretty proud of the CE, we'd like to turn your attention to that first one. Why? Because we have really maxed out the physical capacity of the box with goodies. We think this raises the bar for \"standard\" and we hope you'll think so, too. Also, since pre-orders are live, you might be wondering if there\u2019s any point in placing an order now. Yes, if you want to give us some extra support. Pre-orders help us build anticipation \u2014 the more copies you pre-order, the more likely it is for us to get retail (both digital and physical) behind the game. Therefore, if you like what you see, we will appreciate you \"voting yes\" for CP2077 with a pre-order. If you are still hesitating though, we would rather you wait for more materials or reviews. Our goal is for you to truly enjoy CP2077 and not regret a pre-order.\n\nTake care and looking forward to seeing you in Night City! CD PROJEKT RED team",

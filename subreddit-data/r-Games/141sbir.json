So I'm glad they're in the \"safe\" category. I hear good things about CK and EU, they're on my \"one day I'll play you\" list.",

Games like EU and CK are set in a time period where it's easier for players to mess around if they want to. So on the one hand they can recreate a historically accurate HRE, but on the other they can take over the world as an Irish count. \n\nWith vicky 3 it feels like the time period is just too set in stone. It's more set in historic realism and while that appeals to a lot of people, it also really restricts what you can do in the game.",

I think they've kinda screwed themselves by making Eu4 expansions so much about mission trees and power creep for the selected nations because now people think that's what the game's content are about, when in reality the games have always been about systems and specific \"flavor\" was sort of an afterthought that got tossed in via DLC.\n\n\nLiterally every Paradox game has launched without much in the way of \"unique national events and decisions,\" it wasn't even a question until people started playing heavily DLCed EU4.  The fact that EU4 came with different national idea sets for a bunch of nations at launch was a huge shift and actually decried by a lot of veterans for being railroading and basically giving nations superpowers.",

I started playing when CK2 was released but we have to deal with the Paradox of today and the audience they have now. I stick mostly to Anbennar, Old World Blues, Kaiserreich, After the End and Stellaris. \n\nI bounced off Victoria 3 mainly due to the performance issues when it launched. I mainly play Paradox games, cycle through then every few months. Right now I am in another Anbennar phase. I really want to like Victoria 3 but it is missing the flavor all the mods I play have.",

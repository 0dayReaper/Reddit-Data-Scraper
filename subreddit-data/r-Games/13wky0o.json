Once you got the swing of things it started amping up (hello overpowered taser), but so many encounters before you get acquainted with all the nuances were passed by the skin of your teeth.\n\nGorky17 was published as Odium in North America (still have my CD), but now its just always Gorky 17. [https://store.steampowered.com/app/253920/Gorky\\_17/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/253920/Gorky_17/) Actually on sale for $2, high recommend but will note that like other older games of this type, you either need to have an ability to power through older jank or have played it when it was current. Will say though that overall aesthetics/feel is a bit like Fallout 1/2 mixed with Resident Evil.",

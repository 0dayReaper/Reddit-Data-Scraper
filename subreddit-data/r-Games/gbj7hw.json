You just dive in, except for a few campaign missions where are are a regular battle Droid or don't have jet troopers or something. The heroes aren't something you play as. Instead they're just there. Either an ally you try to outperform, or a Jason-esque enemy you can't really take down.\n\nIt's just pure action with you fighting the fights. Your skill is what turns the tide of the fight, not your Uber class party members or whatever.\n\nBattlefront 2, as well as the EA games, moved away from that with perks, customizable weapons, and killstreak based things.",

The pistol is probably the best weapon in the game, change my mind. Kills in a couple shots, stupidly accurate, and fires as quickly as you can click the mouse - the only drawback is the limited ammo. The award rifle is also great, it fires a 3 shot burst like Bobba Fett's gun (in the game), and will kill if you land a full burst. Also can't forget the shotgun. It's about the same as the stock one but more damage and maybe more ammo(?). \n\nYou need to get the award ~70 times or so (going off memory) to get them permanently - it will say \"legendary\" next to it in your service record. There are damage boosts and reductions and stuff you can get too which make you even more powerful. You become a god by the time you unlock everything, which feels so satisfying when you started out with the same shitty equipment as everyone else.\n\nDefinitely wouldn't call it a \"weapon customization system\" though.",

The different sides having slightly different classes (like one side having a sniper with two zooms but less ammo) made it a bit more interesting. Having all the classes unlocked from the start also helps, and I think the new classes in BF2 are mostly not that interesting. The crosshairs all being the same in BF2 also made the classes feel less special.",

It's not about the heroes with lightsabers or hip shooting blasters, it's about the grunts with the rifles. To this end, squad control plays a bigger part in the game, the maps are better, the army roles are more significant and all available at the start of battle, and it focuses on elements of full scale combat particular to these types of games - positioning, holding a front, pushing, retreating. The maps also help facilitate this, as they are designed to be balanced while also often asymmetric. And they have features which allow for emergent narrative in the battle - choke points, sniper roosts, various juxtaposed elevations, cover everywhere as well as wide open spaces for big pushes, etc. The maps are made for gameplay, not to emulate a movie.  \n\nSWBF2 is just a fucking brawl - change my mind.",

And every part of Geonosis, even the outlying rock spires where the damned separatists had their well defended turrets.\n\nI don\u2019t remember ANY specific locations in maps of SWBF2, I only remember the maps themselves, because they just weren\u2019t designed to have memorable locations.  Like, the crystal planet just looked like a crystal planet no matter where you went.  It had absolutely no memorable locations within the map.",

Mechanically, both are close to the Battlefield franchise in spirit, but Battlefront 2 kinda never *looks* that way.  Battlefront 1 totally does.\n\nIf you like either, then get the other one.

Battlefront 2 has a story mode which is pretty good.",

Basically just instant action (you with your AI bot team vs enemy bot team) with the enemy bot team being reskinned as Naboo guards/Gungans depending on the level. There\u2019s usually a clip from the respective movie that correlates with the mission beforehand or afterwards, but that\u2019s about it. Now the Battlefront 2 (2005) campaign? That\u2019s worth getting, even though it\u2019s not considered canon anymore.\n\nYou can play single player instant action at the planet and map of your choosing, but it\u2019s only one game mode and all bots other than yourself.",

I don't think it was this one, but if it was, I definitely wanna get it. \n\nI'm almost positive it was on PS2(EDIT: It's maybe possible I rented another console and it's one of the Rogue Squadron games, but I'm still unsure). I'm 99% sure the entire game was only fighting in ships. I remember flying Y-wings, various other ships(I'm not up on all my Star Wars ships, sorry). I remember a few different missions flying through canyons and shooting mines. I remember a level using the millenium falcon and having to wrap the legs of an AT-AT in a large crater type area. It was one of my favorite games ever, but I think I rented it from Blockbuster and can never recall the name or even figure it out looking at titles and vids. Anyone?",

Or the tanks and helping my infantry move forward. I still have no idea what I'm doing with jedi/heroes because I get to pick them so infrequently but it's definitely more often than before now that my scores higher and im getting more points.",

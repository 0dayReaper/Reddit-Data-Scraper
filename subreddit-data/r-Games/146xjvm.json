    "postText": "Hey r/Games!  After about two years of development, I am excited to show off the Steam page for **Doodle Dice Monsters**!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/LxZOTT1](https://imgur.com/a/LxZOTT1)\n\nI came up with this game concept when I was about 8, using RPG dice that I spent my allowance on because they were cool but had absolutely no idea what to do with. Now, many years later, I finally have the skills to soup up the game and make it into a full blown videogame!\n\nDDM is a fast and strategic turn-based game where you get to draw your own characters! Form your six character dream team, then fight in tag-team combat in either multi-player or single-player mode: the winner not only gets epic loot, but gets to take one of the defeated Doodlemon for their own!\n\nEach monster has one of 7 fighting styles, which gives them a double damage bonus against 2 other fighting styles, and belongs to one of 6 Tiers, each of which has a unique moveset. The way to win is to strategically choose the order your Doodlemon fight in and use your special abilities to take advantage of your strengths and your opponents weaknesses.\n\nMultiplayer is where the game really shines through. There is something really special about all the characters being drawn by (non-dev) people who care about them. You might be surprised how attached you get to your Doodlemon, even if they are poorly drawn, only to have one of them snatched away when you lose. The getting to steal one when you win totally makes up for that though!\n\n**Steam Page**: [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2454170/Doodle_Dice_Monsters) **Announcement Trailer / Gameplay Video:** [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGXU--BiGyQ) **Discord:** [Link](https://discord.gg/p4S9UxKQ9u)\n\nStill a lot of development to come, so be sure to let me know what you think!  \nWhat would YOU draw?",

People like to say certain games are \"like Dark Souls\" but they never really got the design down. They were either too simple or too convoluted. Unlike certain other games that lack in competition due to lineage of brand recognition or by having a head start, FromSoft stayed above the rest by just being better than them. At least gameplay-wise.",

You boot it up, are told virtually nothing, and just go off in whatever direction you choose. It's heartening to see something so divergent make such a splash.",

It's a game that lets the younger generation experience \"old school\" gaming without having to play something that is literally old. You really don't get that too much anymore.\n\nEven tabletop gaming has moved in the same direction, where stuff like D&amp;D 5e gives some classes functionally superhuman powers right at level 1... but that's a different discussion for another time.",

Not having the game constantly tell you where to go or litter the map with \"points of interest\" is why it's so fun to explore because there could be a new boss, NPC, weapon, weapon skill, summon, trinket, or armor around every corner... and you find it all organically if you're not following an online guide.

I've always liked the combat in Souls games, the lore etc. But haven't been able to make it too far because I'd get stuck and then burn out from having to run back to bosses and stuff (except Bloodborne, I beat that because the combat was easier for me). \n\nI love that in ER, you usually spawn close to the boss, that you can summon to give yourself a bit of help in combat, and especially that if you get stuck, there are tons of other things to do. \n\nI hope this is the formula going forward. I just want better co-op integration and performance issues corrected, and it'd be a 10/10 for me.",

(I'm speaking from the perspective of someone who has played all the Souls games and is currently level 99 and wrapping up the game.)\n\nLots of those folks are hyped that the map is so big and mentally extrapolate that the rest of the game is just going to be more of Limgrave, but that isn't really the case for better or worse. Obviously the next zones still look great and are fun to explore, but it's not quite the same experience as Limgrave at all in terms of either difficulty or open world POI density.\n\nProbably their increase in player numbers and the overwhelming popularity of Limgrave and the open world concept may inform the direction they go in the future though.",

After finishing it and well on my way to platinum, it is absolutely the best open world game I have ever played and I actually have a little post-game depression because I can't imagine another game will capture this feeling for awhile. Which is funny since I commented right before it came out how people saying things like \"Elden Ring will ruin all other games for me\" are kind of silly yet here I am with that feeling a little bit.\n\nThe sheer amount of stuff to find is insane. Not one area feels empty or like it was forgotten. There is nothing really useless that you find too. There's no dumbass collectibles (well, I guess the paintings are a collectible but they literally show you a place to go in the game to find an item so they aren't really).\n\nIt's the solid gameplay of Soulsborne on top of an incredible open world that has SO MUCH to find and explore. I mean, this might actually be a perfect game to me. It easily could have been a whatever open world but still a great game because of the gameplay and bosses but nope, they just nailed it on all fronts. Solid open world, solid bosses (a lot of bosses, and some no doubt suffer from some annoying design/mechanics but there's fucking EIGHTY THREE BOSSES so it's not surprising), so much cool shit to find. \n\nThe only thing I kind of wish was changed a bit was weapon upgrading/respeccing requiring an item. A game like this encourages you with finding all these cool weapons and items and spells but you have to pay a decent price to be able to utilize them with respeccing/upgrade walls. Even post-game I'm still wanting to try a bunch of weapons and builds but I'm running out of larval tears and I'm pretty sure the +10/+25 upgrade stones are exhausted for me since there's only a handful.",

I *think* every type of weapon can be found in  Limgrave, right?",

Then in June 2021 they released a trailer which made the ultra thirsty fans explode, and I think that explosion of excitement is which drew many eyes outside the fanbase onto it, and the overwhelming positive reaction when it released just boosted the hype even further. And here's the result.\n\nCongratulations, Elden Ring. I had seen only the E3 2019 teaser trailer before I started playing and it's been a blast.",

Like the man brings so much mixup potential that I imagine new players can easily feel overwhelmed by him (hell even as a vet I felt like something seemed off with how tricky he felt).\n\nThe counter balance to having such a beefed up moveset for beeing the first mandatory boss seems to be pretty much the fact you can do so much else than actually fighting him if you are stuck, which is pretty cool way to deal with people getting annoyed at bering hardstuck at a fight.",

He makes you understand that you shouldn't just try to power through bosses in ER the same way you would in other souls games. You should explore the world, get consumables, craft, get new ashes of war and summons, and THEN go back and try a boss if you're having trouble.\n\nIn that way, I think he's very effective and a good level of difficulty.",

Godrick actually requires you to learn the fight though or he'll wreck you.\n\nI suspect it's intentional. Fromsoft seems to want you to quickly make it to Margit and then bounce off so you'll go explore elsewhere for a while. Then Godrick is there to make sure you actually know what you're doing. Souls veterans will probably struggle more with Margit while people new to the series will struggle with Godrick",

The ability to jump is a game changer for sure and it'll be very VERY difficult to go back and play previous From games, because I'll be trying to jump everywhere and won't be able to. I also love that because of that jump, there's just way way more verticality to the areas and I've caught myself several times going 'hahaha I'm so clever I totally abused the system and got to a place they didn't intend' only to moments later see a thing that basically equates to From going \"Hey what's up, we actually explicitly meant for you to come here\" It's definitely my favourite of their games so far, and I am fanatical when it comes to home much I adore their previous games.",

I hear the late game bosses/areas are better in this regard, but there is something to be said about the refined perfection that is Central Yharnam and the lead up to Bloodborne's first mandatory boss, Father Gascoigne.\n\nWhat Elden Ring excels at is still nothing less then incredible, I just personally prefer the single perfectly prepared dish approach vs a the giant buffet that Elden Ring is.",

BotW has a gorgeous open world with an exploration structure that is open and rewarding, but it often feels like there's little depth outside of shrines and the physics system. \n\nElden Ring takes my primary BotW complaint - the lack of well designed, structured areas within the open world - and perfects it. We have a world as open and free at BotW with tons of small and large scale dungeons that provide the more structured experience From is known for. \n\nI'm honestly stunned at how well put together it all is.",

The amount of hidden dungeons and castles is absolutely wild. New biomes everywhere u go. Never mind the stunning music and other things that change through out an area or a day. \n\nWalking into a forest I lost my mind at the detail, and that included the scary voices that whisper to you as you adventure creating a captivating experience. \n\nOr even an enemy that is a bat with a human head. U know it\u2019s close by because it sings beautifully creepy Oprah music. \n\nAn absolutely impeccable game",

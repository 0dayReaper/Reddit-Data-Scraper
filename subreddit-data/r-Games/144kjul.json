You can find his letter to her in the piano in her house where you get her final limit break.*\n\nCloud and Zack were rounded up along with the other survivors from the town for use in Hojo's experiments. Cloud was near death and the injections of mako and Jenova cells were probably the only thing that kept him alive until Zack broke them out.\n\nMost of the other test subjects became the Sephiroth \"clones.\" Cloud retaining his individuality, albeit with intense PTSD, is a testament to his mental and physical strength, similar to actual members of SOLDIER, who, after Sephiroth, were also injected with Jenova cells.\n\n*How the note was preserved or restored after Shinra rebuilt the town isn't totally clear.",

Nibel, Cloud only got scraped knees and Tifa nearly died at the age of 7. \n\nSo Cloud's always had extraordinary durability. It was his own self doubt that made him weak, when he had the strength to rival Sephiroth all along.\n\nIt is still a fantasy game. In the original, the party is strong enough to fight off Ultima Weapon in Mideel and keep Diamond Weapon occupied.",

It was obviously - well, sort of - a thing in the original game as well, but the whole climax of Remake was predicated on Sephiroth tricking Cloud into unwriting the future where Sephiroth was doomed to lose. Like, normally these sorts of things are temporary setbacks that the party overcomes and the player can reasonably ignore, but this is the premise for the trilogy now.",

What if there was something like at the moment, Cloud has a vision, looks up to see Sephiroth dropping down. He blocks Sephiroth and you have a scene (or fight) that ends with Cloud running his sword through Sephiroth. But then it gets revealed that it was one of Sephiroth's mind games and it turns out this Sephiroth was actually Aerith.",

The first game gave players a lot of bonding time with this character in full HD, remade glory. Then when players think &gt;!they can finally save Aerith by rewriting fate, they're ultimately unsuccessful anyways!&lt;.\n\nKilling off a different character (especially a non party character) instead would be less impactful. You already have a whole other version of the game where that hypothetical stand in character lives, why do I care if they die in this alternate timeline?",

Aerith's death matters to VII's story, and if they're interested in retelling it - even in the broadest, most thematic strokes - she still needs to die by Sephiroth's hand. What they can afford to change is how the rest of the party interacts with it. They can't treat her death like a surprise anymore, so I doubt they will. It'll be the shadow hanging over the entirety of Rebirth.\n\nThe whole \"you couldn't save Tifa\" thing that Sephiroth is doing to Cloud will undoubtedly turn into \"you couldn't save Aerith\" as Cloud's memories of his past(s) become more clear. I'm sure we'll get some \"you're *not* my Aerith\" scenes as he struggles to confront the fact that she died in his arms in a way that rhymes with earlier his earlier confrontations with Tifa, and by the time that he accepts her into his heart a sword has gone through hers.

So whatever's going on with them being carried on stretchers is likely timeline fuckery in some way.\n\nI don't know that it's literally Zack's timeline like some people are proposing, but if it's at the beginning of the game, our party should already be far out of the way of being affected. And it's not unreasonable to assume the 'tornado' is a reference to the end of the last game.",

I didn't really 'get' staggering for a good chunk of the game, I'd always stagger when they were close to death.\n\nYou also get it when taking big chunks of damage, but IIRC you lose your limit break when dying. So if you kind of need to be in a state where you can take X damage but survive it + heal to actually be able to use your Limit Break. Fury Ring may help with that too, I don't know if it has a direct effect on top of that, but it does boost both your incoming and outgoing damage.\n\nOtherwise a 'safer' option is Transference Module combined with Cloud's Disorder/Tifa's Focused Strike. The item builds up Limit Break for ATB usage, and those two abilities give them back ~3/4s of an ATB bar assuming they hit, so they're fairly spammable. There are other options you have to max out ATB spam. \n\nNot counting Gotterdammerung.",

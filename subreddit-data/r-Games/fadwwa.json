Even most Mega Brutal guides start Saudi, with Egypt and India being the runner ups.",

China works from the top up completely and thus it deals with issues in a top down fashion. \n\nNo prefecture official has the ability to issue orders on an issue this serious, No town officials do either. Neither do regional officials and thus it gets passed up the totem pole to the people who have all the real power and the response reflected that and entire cities got quarantined\n\nEven the regional officials who have immense power are following the orders from the  top on this one",

That\u2019s why the controls and physics are all garbage; it was designed to be playable with touch controls first and foremost. \n\nSo sure, Sonic 4 was crap, but the studio already proved they could make fun Sonic games if they were designed for a normal control scheme.",

SEGA decided to combine the past remasters + the new Mania developed 3&amp;Knuckles remaster into one project. SEGA also integrated the Hedgehog engine to give it a 3D flare in menus as well as a mission mode.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say they had a breakup as they\u2019re back for origins plus, but I would say they\u2019re pissed over how SEGA rushed them.",

Unleashed onwards just shunted a gradually escalating percentage of the game into locked 2D planes despite being a 3D game. \n\nLike I think Forces was easily 60% 2D and Frontiers, while more open, had an entire island that was basically 2D only. It just feels increasingly lazy. This feels especially ass backwards in Generations which explicitly has a split between classic and modern Sonic, and yet modern Sonic still has at least a quarter of each stage locked on a 2D plane (Modern Planet Wisp is the most bastardized of all, being literally 90% 2D).",

Rise of Lyric on Wii U sold 500k copies, and Shattered Crystal on 3DS sold under 200k copies. The fact they decided to try again is pretty crazy, but I guess they hoped the popularity of the TV show would help support Fire &amp; Ice, the 3DS sequel. I cannot find any sales numbers, though.",

Sonic 1, 2 and 3 were classic platformers that rewarded precision jumps, with the occasional loop-de-loop or nice long straight to make the player feel fast. Momentum was built up gradually rather than being \"switched on\" with a button press. It's only really in the 3D games that moving at mach speed became an actual gameplay element, for better or worse.",

Mania was praised for its art, this has been immediately criticized. \n\nI just said that it didn't need to be pixel art but 2D would have looked significantly better. When you make a 3D title like this and it looks noticeably worse than other 3D games, it makes the whole thing feel incredibly cheap. \n\nI'm not saying that the game will be bad. It could be very fun. What I am saying is that the visuals are boring and uninspired and I wish they'd gone a different direction and judging by how people are reacting to this, that isn't an unpopular opinion.",

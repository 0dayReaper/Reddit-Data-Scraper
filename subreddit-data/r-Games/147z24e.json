Of course the gacha DNA is still very clear in its design, but the fact that you can just dedicate time to it at your own pace and unlock everything normally instead of being subjected to FOMO and whatnot is awesome.\n\nNot sure if the game's any good but here's hoping.",

You could pretty much play every level by closing your eyes and tapping the screen. There was almost no game there, I don't even know how to describe it.\n\nI got about far enough in to do some gacha pulls and try some of the higher start characters... who played exactly the same. \n\nHard pass",

I downloaded it thinking I could link to my mobile account and was mistaken.  Now they're creating an offline release while NebulaJoy's online environment (the one most mobile players have at this point) is behind content-wise but still running.  \n  \nWeird decisions all around, I guess.",

I don't know how much of the monetization and gacha and all of that bullshit they removed from it... but even if they removed all of it, it doesn't change that this is still a spreadsheet simulator-style phone game with phoned-in gameplay that is a shell of what the series is known for to give voice to the numbers on the spreadsheet and only exists to endlessly grind for more numbers to go on the spreadsheet.\n\nIt *looks* like Mega Man X.  It *sounds* like Mega Man X.  But, all the soul is gone and relatively all the gameplay design is gone.  Some of that is by necessity.  It's a phone game... I don't know how you actually play something like Mega Man X with touch controls, but that's kind of the point here.  Instead of making something specifically tailored for a phone or finding something better that would fit the limitations of a phone, like Battle Network for instance would be much more natural, they completely butcher something really gameplay-heavy like Mega Man X to turn it into something that just isn't Mega Man X no matter how hard they try to hide it.",

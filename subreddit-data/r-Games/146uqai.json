Plus obviously Halo and maybe general unexpected cool stuff.\n\nBut with what was missing,  lots of cool announcements.  And the Starfield thing was amazing.  It was a really good presentation,  and then starfield elevated all of it.  \n\nIf Starfield works as advertised,  that will be remarkable.",

There were a lot of vague release date announcements, which I gotta be honest, I don\u2019t really trust Microsoft when it comes to release dates. It\u2019s fine to delay games until finished, but with Xbox, I both expect delays and don\u2019t that they don\u2019t necessarily translate to a finished product when all is said and done.\n\nNow for the good. This showcase really sold me on Starfield. That is, I would definitely renew my Gamepass subscription for it. Plus, it also helps that the phenomenal Lies of P will be dropping in the same ballpark. September is a superb month. Avowed looks really fun, and despite seemingly pretty significant controversy about the art style, I\u2019m pretty excited to get my hands on it. Clockwork Revolution really has my interest too. I\u2019m not thrilled about Fable getting another trailer with no gameplay, but it established the vibe, and my impression of what little we got was really positive.",

The fable reboot especially was weird because I loved the older fables and this just felt so different from those.

At least Ill wait until I see the gameplay before I make full judgement.\n* South of Midnight\n   * I like stylistic games more than realistic ones, and its rare we get to see games set in swamps or bayous. Only one I can think of in recent times being Hunt Showdown (because I know there will be that one guy). So far looking like a hunting or at least high fantasy game, and Im all for it.\n* Fable\n   * This was insanely, and oddly charming. Idk how they managed to do it, but typically, unless I already knew about the game and what its about, I found it hard to care about cinematics. But this was so enjoyable to watch that I didnt ever care that no gameplay was shown. Also, oddly enough, and I dont know if its just me and the fact that I havent played a Fable game in over a decade, but the gameplay looked more \"human\" that what I remember being used to with Fable. I feel like it used to have a more cartoony vibe in the models, but this one looked more humanlike but at the same time having an animation feel, if that makes sense.\n* Clockwork Revolution\n   * This came out of nowhere and Im glad it did. It gave a Bioshock Infinite vibe. Im not sure whats going on, and it looks like a choice heavy game which I dont usually care about, but it  does like it could be fun which Im all for.\n* Avowed\n   * FINALLY. And what caught me off guard is guns! Guns in high fantasy, magically enchanted games like this are so rare that when I saw them I was literally thrown aback.",

Or let you set a cap on how much of something you want. Because there are a lot of games where I want to take almost everything but I don't need the wood because I already have 14 bajillion. So with games that have limited stacks I either have to sit there and take each item individually, or take all and constantly be cleaning out my inventory when I have too much of something and the game has created new stacks.\n\nMaybe there are games that already do this, but if so I've never seen one. Just seems like it would be a good quality of life feature.",

im annoyed at the missed opportunities that you can absolutely feel emanating from the things they showed during the deep dive. obviously ideally these stories would also incorporate the gameplay systems to reinforce the story like blood and hunger or doom or disco elysium or pathologic or hotline miami, but i think that is an unfair expectation.\n\nbecause if there are complex and well written stories that meaningfully interact with the systems of the game and the dynamics &amp; setting of the planet, you will put them on the mandatory path so the development time doesnt go to waste. and that leaves the rest of the planets more populated with pseudo-radiant quests. the scale is too large for a development team to fully think about how these cultures would develop on a thousand radically different environments and actually make them worth emotionally engaging with. \n\nspeaking of which, holy fucking shit some of these characters and lines they showed off in the \"Your Quest\" section of the deep dive were cringe inducing. im so tired of stunted video game writing. i think we all deserve better. &gt;!(on a similar note imo the facial animations on some characters, even the main quest factions ones they showed off, are more stilted than the outer worlds even though that game released 4 years ago and were not super impressive even back then)!&lt;\n\ngodd wants to establish exploration and worldbuilding and immersion as driving forces for you as a player, and i think that radiant 1000 planet concept completely flies against it. how are you meant to enjoy exploring when it brings you ubisoft outposts? be interested in the worldbuilding when the stories in these quests have to take it at such a surface level in order to fit in the radiant quest system? or be immersed when any giant intra- or inter-planetary distance travelled will bring you a combination of those two and not a genuinely well written and connected thriving world of interacting systems and characters? \n\nwhat conflicts and ideas will the main story try to dissect about this world? \"wuaoah 2020s capitalism but in space\" isnt enough to be interesting worldbuilding anymore. the most excited i got was at 11:13 when i saw two people wearing a conical hat in the chinatown of the \"pleasure city where anything goes!\" because it showed some flair, personality, and humanity among a sea of nasa-punk saturated architecture and fashion. which is annoying because now im imagining a setting that incorporates brick and wood and nature and life into its surroundings whilst still having nasa-punk technology and spaceships and space stations. i would fucking kill myself if this is what we end up building and have to live in on habitable earth-like planets. even the brick buildings at 12:07 are depressing! exotic planets obviously get more of a pass since they need to weather the elements. &gt;!(wow! anarcho capitalism city. how edgy, i cant wait for the interesting insights and thematic exploration the quests will give of how it would be to live in this city, and how it operates socioeconomically with the rest of the planet, and for the player to impart meaningful changes upon it by upsetting the intricate gang dynamics that keep it violently running. sarcasm aside it will probably be a le edgy boob flavour level where youre tasked to brainlessly engage in crime that escalates in severity over a questline and kill a gang leader or two as a finale while the city stays static except for flavour voice lines like \"wuaoh! i cant believe Jared is gone!\" before your rampage is completely forgotten across the planet and solar system and there are no loose ends from what youve done)!&lt;\n\nthe second i saw the health bar flash up so prominently in the UI for enemies that go down in 0.5 seconds and dont actually need it, i got an omen that the future \"challenges\" of the combat are going to be paint-by-numbers bullet sponges that barely make you engage in the \"probably more [weapon] mods and more weapons in this game than any other game we've done before\". wow. so much \"\"\"content\"\"\". sounds super fun and not beige-slop padding like every other weapon count boast from this industry. i want them to show off the gunplay and what it actually offers us. doom has the deadly resource and weapon-strategy + kiting dance, ultrakill has a multi-focus on parkour and 3d traversal, hotline miami has ultraviolent puzzle and strategy solving that culminates in a matrix-like trance if someone would perform it in real life, counter strike has pvp race to the top in honing your motor &amp; strategy &amp; communication skills. what they showed were enemies that operate the same way and die in 0.5 seconds whether theyre at level 8 or almost twice as high at level 14. what is there to be excited about? why would we use your thousands of guns if this is how youre showing us the combat works? are we as players going to fly around and shit once or twice because it looks cool and not because its fun? they seriously dropped the ball on that front.\n\nfucking hell. rant over. i could go on for hours. the game looks graphically beautiful, the modular ship building is cool, the space combat having energy resource management is interesting and cool, the planetary scales are massive and super immersive, planets as modders' platforms is cool, its exciting to see bethesda start development on a new engine in preparation for stuff like elder scrolls 6, zero g is cool and recoil pushing you back in zero g is even cooler, some of the interiors are really well done. i will cry and shit when the game releases and my negative impressions are proven wrong.",

They put emphasis on these being the biggest cities in a Bethesda game, which is impressive, but that does make me think.\n\nI prefer TES cities over FO Cities, because usually 90% of NPCs have names and unique dialogue. When you get to a town, part of the fun is chatting to everyone, learning their relationships and so on. While in FO, there's a few key NPCs and a bunch of filler ones to act as set dressing. Which is fine mind you, they go for scale and given bigger and better is what they're aiming for in Starfield, I imagine they'll lean closer to the FO side of it.\n\nBut I hope there's still those little hometown style interactions.",

Because if so, I would like to point out that their previous releases were Redfall as a publisher and Fallout 76 as a developer. Also there is literally no downside to waiting for reviews to see if their the game has everything the trailers promised and the game is a playable state (no gamebreaking bugs).\n\nTrusting a company will deliver what they promise is never a safe bet, even if they have been good on their promise in the past (eg Cyberpunk 2077). And unlike 30 years ago there is no company loyalty anymore.",

Regardless, it's still not the smartest move to preorder the game before reviews are released and even worse to pay for dlc when you don't even know what that dlc will be. Reviews are generally released before the launch date and often before the early access period too.",

Bethesda titles are some of the most fun titles I've played. Everything from their old Terminator titles like 2029, Rampage, Future Shock/SkyNET. The old Elder Scrolls stuff from Arena to ESO. And their Fallout stuff.\n\nI know I'm going to get something that I'm going to have a lot of fun with but hey guess what? It's going to have issues when it comes out as *every* Bethesda game tends to have issues. But guess what? I can look past those and still have fun.\n\nOh wait I'm sorry fun is a bad word with you kids now. God knows we should all be like you and not enjoying anything and just whining non-stop on the Internet about things that will never change.",

A lot more space for the human touch even on the procedural wasteland planets. It is very funny though how Starfield uses the same scanning feature and laser resource harvesting tool.",

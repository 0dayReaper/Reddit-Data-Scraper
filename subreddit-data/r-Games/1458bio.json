            "comment": "I can't say I really disagree with the fundamental idea behind this piece: A lot of gaming criticism is fairly narrow and comparative, with space more often given to explaining why a specific game is better or worse than other games in the genre rather than assessing whether the mechanics work in the context of the game. Similarly, discussions about what people want from a game often focus on specific mechanical systems they would like to see put together rather than what ideas/story/player experience they would want to see. Stuff like \"I want Pokemon but Octopath Traveler style combat\" is more descriptive and clearer than \"I want a game that utilizes limited move pools to keep the player feeling tense and considering party composition at all times\", but is it actually a better pitch?\n\nHowever, the way the essay is actually written makes that point pretty badly. It requires a familiarity with multiple different genres and terms that it bounces between rapidly, it spends much of its time on digression, and while I am also inclined to agree that \"girl games\" or more vibes-based low-challenge games in general don't get a lot of discussion relative to their popularity, that entire section feels almost like it belongs in another essay entirely. There's frustratingly little meat on the bones of this article, and the extremely large and frequent images don't help; it somehow feels both padded and extremely short.",

                    "comment": "It made a claim that terms like depth and immersion drove design away from femininity in games like socialization and dressing up but Im not seeing the connection? A lot of \"immersive\" games allow you to customize the physical expression of your character. For socialization, Im not quite sure what they are looking for. Many games have narrative trees for dialouge, but maybe thats not refined enough for the author, or Im just misinterpreting what they want, or we simply arent there with our technology? \n\n  \n\n\nOtherwise though I agree with a lot of the points the author made. Too often I see people talk about concepts like TTK in FPS games, saying it should be more like X or Y, without really considering what it means in the context of this game. As if there is a perfect TTK that can be fit into every game. \n\nRealism in games, for me, is another example most clear in GTAV and RDR2. Its like Rockstar has this drive to make the most realistic games, without considering if it really adds value. I really hate how hard it is to control your character, always having to take wide turns when walking around like a human boat. \n\nAtomic Hearts is another one that felt like it was made by a checklist. Instead of trying to find the most efficient way for players to empty a room of all its trash, maybe we should be looking at what purpose junk carries and why players should want or need to collect it. Because even though it was easier to empty out all the drawers, it was still tedious to feel the need to walk into every room and act like a human vacuum for 30 seconds before continuing. Or its open world sections that so many people felt detracted from the game. \n\nRedfall's solution to junk loot was having it immediately turn into cash as soon as you picked up anything. Which is easier but.... what does it add then? Why not have just enemies drop cash, or have big treasure caches to find? \n\nI do think that 'design by committee' is a major flaw in game development right now, and unfortunately it wont ever go away, itll just adjust to a slightly different paradigm because its the safest option for a product that costs a LOT to produce.",

            "comment": "There is a lot of obviousness to this, but at the same time I feel as people tend to hype the phrase way too much, and overlook the pitfalls it has also.\n\nTake any over the top difficult game, and you could easily argue that if it were easier, more people would play it/go further in the game and have a more enjoyable experience, but this is not the case. I would argue that even lowering the difficulty of many such games would make them too easy, and expose other flaws in them such, as lacking story or other elements. \n\nAnother example would be comparing say old Zelda games versus newer ones, in that you need to go into the menu to select a sub-item, versus being able to pull out the wheel, or a in-focus menu comes up like in ToTK when binding something to an arrow. People tend to equate more efficiency = good game design, and while I believe most agree with a lot of those choices, in that they make it a more seamless experience, it is not necessarily better overall for gaming to do so. There are plenty of games where pausing for a moment to review your inventory in a paused menu, and select things, is not a detraction but an improvement.\n\nAnother part of this problem is that people confuse AAA games with having the expectations of a better game design philosophy. Just because it is fully voiced, controls are modernized fully, and it has a ton of scripted sequences, then it must be at the pinnacle or forefront of design. \n\nThe worst thing I hate in that, is the expectation that only some games count as AAA experiences, because of this. People will say something like Atomic Heart is AAA while something like Persona is not. \n\nLook at this wiki for it, and then think about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)\n\nIt is not about the quality or design at all, but Revenue only. AAA refers to it being the Hollywood blockbuster of games, and that is proof positive how out of touch the idea is. Bioshock could have easily been seen like Atomic Heart or a number of others, if the timing was wrong or no one was interested in it, and would it be considered AAA? No.  Plenty of movies turned into cult classics, and plenty of others were expected to be giants and became overnight jokes, flopping hard and costing fortunes. This is also why supposed AAA titles are generally safe bets story/gameplay-wise and that is equated to be good design. \n\nGood game design will shine through, but even then, there are times bad game design leads to notable/quirky/different styles that come as a result. The phrase tries to homogenize development, but it is not that simple. There would be plenty of things that didn't exist if we just tried to focus on making 'perfect' designs in games. \n\nJust like many forms of Art, sometimes our bad decisions are as important as our good ones, when looking at the final outcome. Limitations can lead to growth in unexpected areas. This is where older games you see such a variety, due to shorter development cycle and turn around, when there were a ton of Mario/Space Invader/other clones. Along those lines, I personally think the easier it will be to make/design something that appears to be a AAA game, will lead to an explosion of variety of design choices, but the toolsets are not there yet/costs are too high, for now.\n\n*tl;dr: If good game design were everything, then every game would be the get closer to being the same in the end.*",

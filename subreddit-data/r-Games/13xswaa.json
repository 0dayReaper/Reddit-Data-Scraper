As you're saving civilians using clues around the radio station while cracking jokes and enjoying some retro-inspired tracks, it's hard not to get invested in the story and setting, especially as it features such strong performances from its wacky cast. The pace can be slow at times, but the twists and turns kept me eager to speak with every new caller. You can trust me as a seasoned producer and presenter: this is one radio program worth tuning in for.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameGrin](https://opencritic.com/outlet/436/gamegrin)** - [Artura Dawn](https://opencritic.com/critic/8647/artura-dawn) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/killer-frequency-review/)\n\n&gt;This is 189.16, The Scream, I am Forrest Nash, and I sincerely recommend you pick up this title! Simple puzzles and hilarious dialogue mean just about anyone should tune in to Killer Frequency.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamePitt](https://opencritic.com/outlet/633/gamepitt)** - [Rob Pitt](https://opencritic.com/critic/4974/rob-pitt) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamepitt.co.uk/killer-frequency-ps5-review-plus-ps4-impressions/)\n\n&gt;I really enjoyed Killer Frequency, having to search the studio for clues on how to guide the unlucky victims to safety was lots of fun and very creative. Although I would have liked some of the solutions to be more cryptic and challenging, I was still overcome with satisfaction upon working out the solutions and either saving or killing everyone that called in (depending on my mood). Outside of the imaginative puzzles, the banter and underlying story were very entertaining and an experience I won\u2019t soon forget.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gert Lush Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/413/gert-lush-gaming)** - [Jim Smale](https://opencritic.com/critic/2785/jim-smale) - [7.6 / 10](https://gertlushgaming.co.uk/killer-frequency-review-playstation-5/)\n\n&gt;brilliant little game and one that all 80s horror fans should definitely check out.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [Neil Bolt](https://opencritic.com/critic/838/neil-bolt) - [8 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/killer-frequency-review-ps5/)\n\n&gt;Killer Frequency is a refreshing puzzle adventure under the guise of an 80s slasher flick. Its flirtation with real-time life-or-death decision-making serves to keep it an interesting and varied horror experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Stephen Tailby](https://opencritic.com/critic/942/stephen-tailby) - [6 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/killer-frequency)\n\n&gt;Despite our complaints, though, Killer Frequency is lifted by its daft charm. It's an intriguing, unorthodox murder mystery that fans of narrative-driven games will certainly enjoy \u2014 it just needed a little bit more tuning.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Thumb Culture](https://opencritic.com/outlet/534/thumb-culture)** - [5 / 5 ](https://www.thumbculture.co.uk/killer-frequency-pc-review)\n\n&gt;If you pick up one game through the first half of the year, this one has to be right up at the top of the list. Killer Frequency tries something I have never experienced, and hits every single ball out the park. I haven\u2019t been this excited for gamers to get their hands on a game in a long time! Especially with this one being such a fun game to play through.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Use a Potion](https://opencritic.com/outlet/486/use-a-potion)** - [8.5 / 10](https://www.useapotion.com/2023/06/killer-frequency-pc-review/)\n\n&gt;Killer Frequency\u2019s slick twist of clever puzzling and comedy-horror is a whole lot of fun, even IF it isn\u2019t a particularly challenging experience. But hey, whilst the puzzles aren\u2019t too tricky, the way they\u2019re presented is undeniably cool, whilst the radio DJ role you play is wonderfully executed in-game. Add to that the 80s vibe and charming presentation and it\u2019ll be clear it definitely deserves your attention.\n&gt;\n&gt;I just had a really good time with the game, and whilst I\u2019ll admit that it might have been even more fun to play in VR, helping folks survive the wrath of a killer on a rampage was a blast.\n\n-------------\n\n**[WhatIfGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/842/whatifgaming)** - [Rizwan Anwer](https://opencritic.com/critic/9607/rizwan-anwer) - [8 / 10](https://whatifgaming.com/killer-frequency-review/)\n\n&gt;Killer Frequency is a fun title that you should get if you are really into puzzles, enjoy the 80's atmosphere, or enjoy games with multiple endings. With a decent cast of characters, the game is one you don't want to change stations on.\n\n-------------",

My main gripe with the game, is that a lot of the game systems didn\u2019t seem to be fully developed. \n\nTake for example the soundboard and the jingles, they were never made a part of the gameplay itself and only served to make the people I was streaming to laugh. It would have been much better if the game was more like Not for Broadcast. You could add a layer of complexity, where you have to maintain the quality of the broadcast, which would also add more things to do during long expositions",

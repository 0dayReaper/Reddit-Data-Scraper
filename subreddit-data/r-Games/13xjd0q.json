            "comment": "The original MGS3 voice acting is generally very high quality for a 2004 game. And it's not like remakes haven't done this before. Destroy All Humans 1/2 remake use the original voices from the original game, and design shiny new cutscenes around them. Sometimes the cutscenes are significantly different while using the same voice lines. The ending of DaH2 is ***very*** different to the original tonally.\n\nOne of the complications with rerecording is that several of the voice actors for the Japanese dub have died, and that dub is very important to the Japanese fanbase, and to the development team. So using the original audio lets them sidestep that.\n\nAt this point we don't really know how they plan to approach things like codec calls. Will they keep the same style, or let the player have calls while moving, or what? Or really how they plan to improve the user experience and flow of the game. They will reveal this stuff soon, though. Maybe this month.",

                            "comment": "I think it's important to consider the context of the codec calls.  They were written with this unbroken attention in mind. These aren't really comparable to say Bioshock audio logs, it's not like the technology for voice-over during gameplay didn't exist then. They're essentially short radio drama serials, with a ton of care and attention given to the delivery, direction, and their place in the plot/character progression.\n\nCodec calls are where many major plot points, revelations, and even memorable gags happen.  Not to mention the interactive easter eggs, like the additional info cards you can uncover for your contacts. They deserve, and earn, the full-screen treatment for the most part. \n\nI do think it would be appropriate to have a kind of hybrid system, where some minor/mechanic-based calls are given the MGSV treatment, allowing you to move as they play out.",

Story, character and world building stuff that's pretty interesting if you like the characters, but one major problem: you are so fast and the dialogue cuts off quite a bit with no ability to let it play out. You'll trigger a new event or scene while the previous one is still going. I loved the movement and speed of traversal (you can pretty much fly and you start the game very fast on foot) but it cut what felt like half the wandering dialogue off over the course of the full game. Very modern gaming problem.",

I really liked the fact that hunt marks always had fun spawn conditions. Like for example, Orthos is a clever play on the reoccurring lecherous octopus character Ultros, so the way to spawn him is to have *only* female characters in your party.",

Like, the game didn't even have a caution phase. And evasion phase lasted about 10 seconds and da-dinnggg back to normal.\n\nThe criticisms about the goofy cutscene changes are valid, but the gameplay was still definitely an improvement compared to how rudimentary the stealth was in the original game. Also the rerecorded voice acting def turned out to be a good choice with Naomi and Mei Ling losing their overcooked accents. MGS3 had fire voice acting from the start though so I'm fine with them reusing the old audio.",

It could be something already handled by contracts too, I dunno the specifics of those at all.

When I think residuals I think things like additional compensation based on copies sold or something. Here though it's a different product but they are using the same VA work. In another scenario, if we imagine that a VA signed on for some quick work to provide lines for Game A and then the company decided to reuse those lines in Game B is that legal per usual contracts? While we call this a remaster its still fundamentally a new game.\n\nI googled around a bit and it seems most contract work comes down to either being a buyout or residuals. So its likely based on how unions handled their contracts (though its definitely different for older contracts and who knows if the VAs were in a union then). From what I can tell, non-union work often is in a buyout contract so if those contracts weren't time-bound for reuse then they can reuse them in perpetuity. Union work nowadays varies but looks like it is more residuals based, so it could potentially be covered going forward.\n\nBut yeah, I mean big companies are gonna try to use stuff for free as much as they can. That's kinda what I think will continue to happen too until newer contracts start to hinder that. If we see a good number of remakes that try to employ this strategy I can imagine this becoming a bigger issue for VAs.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; Here though it's a different product but they are using the same VA work.\n\nLets say you write a story for a movie or tv show under a standard WAG contract. If the publishing company decides to re-use your script in the production of a re-creation of the product in the future, you are usually entitled to residual royalties.\n\nAnd of course, if the original piece is re-mastered and re-released to the same **OR DIFFERENT** medium, you are of course entitled to residuals.\n\nGeorge Lucas got residuals for his writing of Star Wars 4-6, even for the Remastered Editions where there was new stuff added, the film was remastered, and it was additionally released to DVDs after the theatrical run. This would have happened even if he did not do additional work on the Remastered Edition.\n\n&gt; From what I can tell, non-union work often is in a buyout contract so if those contracts weren't time-bound for reuse then they can reuse them in perpetuity.\n\nYes, that is correct. Video game VA work is not done under union contracts for the vast majority of the time. VA work for animated TV Series often (used to be usually) is.\n\n&gt; If we see a good number of remakes that try to employ this strategy I can imagine this becoming a bigger issue for VAs.\n\nIt already is for a different reason. If you notice, there is currently a WAG strike going on. They are striking because of how different streaming services metrics measure how much revenue individual pieces of work generate, they are often not getting residuals, even if it's in the contract.",

We saw that happen with Twin Snakes where it completely trivialized the game in a lot of ways since the game wasn't balanced around Snake having first person aiming and the ability to vault. Especially since a lot of the bosses in 3 barring the End, the Boss, and Volgin are fairly simple encounters that will be made even easier if Snake can strafe and dodge roll without endlag.\n\nI would've also like to have seen an expansion of the Camo system since in 3 it was a good idea that mostly boiled down to \"Scan menu for highest number, if number drops, equip the new best camo\". However I have no faith that Konami can do that, and that's not a good sign.",

Relegating him to a set piece makes him a whole lot less threatening.\n\nOriginally he wasn't even going to stalk you in that opening area to begin with, the team had to quickly shove him in there because of the reception to Mr. X.\n\n&gt;It was half as long as RE2 and my counter is that it was as long as a single campaign from RE2 and was naturally shorter because of that\n\nI don't know if I agree with that counter since it was half as long **because** they cut out numerous sections from the original game. That's not a defense, that's just making a game with significantly less content. The original RE3 even got cute with only having one campaign by introducing random elements to puzzles, enemy placements, weapon placements. Right there you could've added some unique horror to Nemesis by not having him show up at the same points every playthrough. Instead he would randomly show up based on a combination of RNG and how well the player is doing. Is the player doing really well? Throw Nemesis in there. Otherwise, hold back.",

But it's noticeably rare.\n\nAt this point it's difficult to pin down a concrete motivation for keeping the OG Japanese/English voices. It's just speculation. But I don't think it's a malicious move.",

I remember reading somewhere that for the Twin Snakes remake, reuse of original game lines would have been difficult due to the quality of the original recordings. Most of it was recorded in a house or something and there were background noises that would have been a problem.\n\nAlso some parts would have to be recast, like Eva for example. 'Suzetta Minet' was an alias for some mystery actress that still isnt known by the public. There's no guarantee she'd be willing or able to return.",

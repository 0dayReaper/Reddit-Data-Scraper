What about every Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram post?\n\nI sincerely hope they get knocked down several pegs for this. I love iOS and Apple devices in general, but the fact that they want complete control over every app that goes on their devices and who gets to make apps is about as anti-competitive as it gets. \n\nNot to mention, they way they've gone ahead and decided to go scorched Earth on Epic and hurt every developer that uses their engine is just plain evil.",

            "comment": "*tldr: \"Gaming developer experiences manager\" at Microsoft, Kevin Gammill, added a declaration to the Epic vs Apple case stating:*\n\n&gt;1. Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine is critical technology for numerous game creators including Microsoft.\n\n&gt;2. Denying Epic access to Apple\u2019s SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS, and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage.\n\n&gt;3. Apple\u2019s discontinuation of Epic\u2019s ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers.\n\n---\n\nI, Kevin Gammill, declare as follows:\n\n1.I am the General Manager, Gaming Developer Experiences for Microsoft. In this role, I oversee Microsoft\u2019s support of game creators (including game developers, audio engineers, level designers, game producers, etc.) within the Xbox ecosystem. Among other things, my team helps game creators achieve their creative goals. I have been an engineer for more than 30 years, including more than 20 years at Microsoft, and have more than 10 years of experience supporting game creators across multiple platforms.\n\n---\n\n2.**Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine is critical technology for numerous game creators including Microsoft.**\n\n(a) Game engines provide creators with a development environment that delivers the necessary graphics, rendering, physics, sound, networking, and other technologies that enable them to build games that run on multiple platforms.\n\n(b) Although some large game creators choose to develop their own proprietary game engines, many others, including small and independent game creators, utilize game engines built by and licensed from third parties. \n\n(c) Many of these creators do not have the resources or capabilities to build their own game engines and rely on the availability of third-party game engines, while other creators may choose to use third-party game engines to save development costs and utilize already-developed technologies. \n\n(d) As a result, Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine is one of the most popular third-party game engines available to game creators, and in Microsoft\u2019s view there are very few other options available for creators to license with as many features and as much functionality as Unreal Engine across multiple platforms, including iOS.  \n\n(e) Microsoft has an enterprise-wide, multi-year Unreal Engine license agreement and has invested significant resources and engineer time working with and customizing Unreal Engine for its own games on PC, Xbox consoles, and mobile devices (including iOS devices).  i.For example, Microsoft\u2019s racing game Forza Street is currently available on iOS and utilizes Unreal Engine.\n\n---\n\n3.**Denying Epic access to Apple\u2019s SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS, and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage.**\n\n(a) Developing a game using different game engines for different platforms may be prohibitively expensive and difficult. In any event, it is not as cost-effective as using a game engine that supports different platforms.\n\n(b) As a result, game creators, including Microsoft, that are preparing to develop a game targeted at multiple platforms generally choose game engines based both on the functionality they provide as well as their ability to support development for those platforms.\n\n(c) If Unreal Engine cannot support games for iOS or macOS, Microsoft would be required to choose between abandoning its customers and potential customers on the iOS and macOS platforms or choosing a different game engine when preparing to develop new games.\n\n(d) Because iOS is a large and growing market for games, Apple\u2019s discontinuation of Unreal Engine\u2019s ability to support iOS will be a material disadvantage for the Unreal Engine in future decisions by Microsoft and other game creators as to the choice of an engine for new games.\n\n(e) Even uncertainty about the Unreal Engine\u2019s ability to continue supporting iOS and macOS will make it less likely for Microsoft (and, I believe, other game creators) to select Unreal Engine for their projects. When game creators are planning development projects, which can last for years, it is important to have confidence that the chosen engine will continue to be available on and support all platforms on which the game creators plan to distribute their games.\n\n---\n\n4.**Apple\u2019s discontinuation of Epic\u2019s ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers.**\n\n(a) For game creators in the later stages of development utilizing Unreal Case Engine and targeting the iOS and/or macOS platform, Unreal Engine\u2019s sudden loss of support for iOS and macOS would create significant costs and difficult decisions. The creator would have significant sunk costs and lost time using Unreal Engine for game creation, and would have to choose between (a) starting development all over with a new game engine, (b) abandoning the iOS and macOS platforms, or (c) ceasing development entirely.  \n\n(b) Apple\u2019s removal of Unreal Engine\u2019s ability to develop updates and improvements for iOS and macOS could also harm already-launched iOS and macOS games built on Unreal Engine. If the game engine can no longer develop updates that take advantage of new iOS or macOS features, fix software bugs, or patch security flaws, this will harm games that have already launched on iOS and macOS (and, in turn, harm gamers). In addition, this situation could bifurcate a game\u2019s player base, such that gamers on iOS or macOS cannot play or communicate with friends or family who are playing on other platforms.\n\n---\n\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct and that I executed this declaration on August 22, 2020 on Lopez Island, Washington.\n\n---\n\n*I have not intentionally edited this declaration besides formatting it for reddit. This comes from pages 14-16 in the pdf.*",

XCloud was straight up not allowed on Apple devices at all unless each game on the service was individually reviewed by Apple. You know, completely ignoring that PEGI and ESRB ratings exist. Also ignoring video and music streaming services that existed on the devices before Apple had proper alternatives themselves with the Apple Music subscription and Apple TV+.\n\nApple see xCloud as a potential problem for them in the future and want to block it before it has a chance. Now *that* is an anti-competitive case waiting to happen.\n\nEdit: To add onto that, I believe most if not all of Microsoft Studios' games going forward are being built on Unreal. So Apple are blocking them on another front also, which is mostly the case Microsoft are bringing up now.\n\nEdit 2: [Eurogamer article on the subject of Apple's (crappy) reasoning.](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-07-apple-blocks-project-xcloud-on-ios)",

Now *that* is an anti-competitive case waiting to happen. \n\nA patent for \"Enabling Interactive Service for Cloud Rendering Gaming in 5G Systems\" belonging to Apple was recently sighted, so it seems like Apple are just blocking the competition to potentially start their own service later. Hard to know for sure because quite a few of their patents never eventuate into consumer products, but this seems all the more egregious when you see this and their stance on blocking xCloud.\n\nEither that, or Apple wants to implement their own framework within iOS, and then force xCloud etc to sign up for a new contract to handle game streaming. Probably with some extra IAP monetisation so Apple gets a cut of *everything*.",

If developers want more of the cut when selling their games, and more budget to put out a better product, they will go exclusive on EGS. Not to mention, both of these are FREE launchers that you can download anytime. This is not anti-competitive behavior.",

Microsoft is kind of shit at marketing, so they can\u2019t pull that off as easily.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s marketing strategy is the idea that their control over iOS and the App Store is in the user\u2019s best interest, even though in many cases it\u2019s clearly not (xcloud, stadia, and the presence of many apps that farm your data regardless). A LOT of people have bought into this unquestioningly, probably because they haven\u2019t tried anything different or just don\u2019t have enough time to care.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Apple hasn\u2019t done some innovative things in the name of privacy and security, but the reality is most of it is just a marketing gimmick to keep people on their platform, and extract as much money from their platform as they can get away with.",

You would be free to avail yourself of those options or not, as you see fit.  Epic being able to offer IAPs using their own choice of payment processor won't stop you from making payments via Apple if that's all you trust.  Epic being able to establish their own app store on iOS won't stop you from solely and exclusively using the official Apple App Store.\n\nPeople who like how things are will lose absolutely nothing, while everyone else will gain actual legitimate *choice*.",

A huge amount of progress has happened in terms of software design since then. It's like choosing between a fifteen year old version of Photoshop and a new one. The level editor that level designers use to make maps for CSGO is almost identical to what was used to make the levels for Half-life 2 close to twenty years ago.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd as others have said, it's not super well documented. Big engines like Unreal, Unity, Godot and, Crytek make a point about being as \"polished\" as possible, and putting out as much information as they can on how to use them. Conversely, \"in house\" engines, like EAs dreaded Frostbite engine, can be very rough around the edges, but in return, you have (or should have) a more or less direct line to the engine developers in case you need help (and you will).\n\n  \n\n\nJumping into Source is kind of the worst of both worlds. You get to use a very rough engine, with terrible documentation, and unless you throw enough money at Valve, chances are you're not getting a lot of helps.\n\n  \n\n\nAlso it runs like absolute dogshit unless you spend an eternity optimizing you game and even Valve can't get it to render anything more than 200 meters away.",

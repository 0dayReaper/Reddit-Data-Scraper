            "comment": "I played the first game only just last year and I think it lost a lot of punch to age because the gameplay got stale for me super fast, but the narrative was so captivating that I couldn't stop pushing forward. I'd probably hop into anything they made, at this point. Control was outstanding (if also perhaps suffering a little bit from stale gameplay and phenomenal narrative/world-building, but the staleness came far later), so I'm definitely looking forward to this.\n\nI didn't end up playing the DLC of the original or America Nightmare, though I do own both. Do they feel substantially different from the original base game? Should I go through them if only to be prepped for the Alan Wake 2?",

The mechanics were neat and the lighting elements were novel for the time, but it really did get stale after the first couple of acts. There's only so many ways you can spice up \"aim flashlight at humanoid blob then shoot with gun.\" I remember stopping after the first real night section, though I enjoyed my time with the game. I think the general consensus is that the game was niche but had its audience.",

I went back to it years later after loving Control and pushed through some of the clunkiness. The narrative really grabbed me and got me through the repetitive sections. \n\nI dunno, I would say the gameplay is definitely not great, but it feels oddly nostalgic at this point? The stiffness and clunk is almost part of the charm these days.",

But that's the nature of things - Lake said a while back they still hadn't made any money off of it, so I'm just thankful we had it at all.",

The atmosphere just felt a little dulled when I booted up the remaster after finishing the original.\n\nTurns out a lot of 360/PS3 era stuff looks kinda great running at higher resolutions?",

I know that some people don't care about the open world, and others don't really see value in intrinsic exploration, but **if you do**, holy shit this game has too much stuff. I feel I have ADHD because it's hard to focus on an objective because the game keeps throwing more at you non stop.\n\nIf you are a parent and give this game to a kid you can chill because they won't be bored for the next 6 months.\n\nEdit: Made clear which game I was talking about",

I started with Rito and basically circling around the entire map and just finishing up Akkala right now. \n\nI feel like in BotW I would have been 3/4 the way through the game and maybe approaching the final Divine beast at this amount of hours. But something about TotK has me so refreshed and excited to explore everything. There is so so much in this game, it's nuts.",

Then we defeat a boss and I'm able to just have this mech as a constant companion just like the current day sages.!&lt;\n\nI have no idea if the game points you in this direction at any point, but either way it's crazy that I was able to just stumble upon this by chance.",

If you saw the tower, you will climb there and ignore everything on the way. Or if you saw the Main quest marker, you will follow it, because you don't care about side quest bullshit. After you finish one dungeon, you right away open the pause menu to see where is the next main one. \n\n\nOf course that with this mentality, the game will be boring. I'm not saying that this is the \"wrong\" mentality, but makes me easier to understand why so many people are so dismissive about this game.",

It makes me think of a friendlier Elden Ring where I can more freely explore and build and go on adventures without quite the same stakes hinging on every single move.  I very much enjoy Elden Ring, but TotK offers a cozy feeling to the adventure that makes me think I'll ultimately spend a great deal more time with it as compared to any souls game.",

It's just a much better-realized BotW, with more interesting skills which are ubiquitously useful instead of situational, and leaning way more towards organically-set up gameplay moments which were the best parts of BotW (the dragon atop Lanayru). So looking back at BotW in a post-TotK world, I would now say \"BotW is a product of its time\" which sounds INSANE.",

BOTW was an extremely focused game, its design had almost no fat. The only real thing that comes to mind for me is Kilton's monster token system, but even then, that's only really a consideration in the endgame. TOTK, on the other hand, just throws everything at the wall. For as much as people talked up how delicately and intelligently BOTW signposted stuff, they sure do seem psyched for a game that signposts a shockingly small amount of its content and encourages the kind of map-combing gameplay that you got when Korok-hunting in BOTW.\n\nTOTK is a game defined by maximalist design, and I don't know what to make of that. BOTW is one of my favorite games and I quit playing TOTK two dungeons in because I think I just don't like it. It made me really sad. I kept waiting for it to \"click,\" and there were these really beautiful and sublime moments where I thought I saw the vision, but I have way more negative feelings than positive about it.",

The Great Fairies mark all the locations on the map automatically. In Lookout Landing you will get suggestions to where the battle quests are or a suggestion of which chasm to check out next. The shrines line up with the roots, so you can use that to find other shrines or roots, depending which you stumble on first.. If you see smoke it's usually a monster camp but if it is coming out in clouds like a smoke signal it is a stable. Some quests will just put an x on your map.",

I thought Breath of the Wild was incredible for the first 40 or so hours, but by the end of doing all the shrines, I was really getting tired of it, and Tears of the Kingdom changes enough to make it great and exciting again, but it's also similar enough that I don't have as much excitement as when I played botw",

In a gaming space that has so fully moved towards Bethesda's open-world niche, they're going to have to really deliver on the deeper RPG angle I think.  \n\nIt's going to be a tall order for Starfield to beat TOTK out for GOTY, but honestly I'm a bit concerned about how it's going to go just from the start.  The stuff they've shown off...just kinda looks boring to me.  And I'm saying this as someone who loves Bethesda games, something about what we've seen so far just does nothing for me.",

You can look at Super Mario 64 or Galaxy, Metroid Prime, Portal, Tetris, Minecraft, Journey, and so on. \n\nBeing structurally the same as BotW doesn't exclude it from the discussion, especially considering that BotW itself is in the GOAT discussion. \n\nOn the topic of \"newness\", I don't think you'll ever find games that do completely unprecedented individual things anymore. Even Dark Souls didn't have anything completely new - interconnected worlds and weighty combat and cryptic environmental storytelling all existed long before 2011. You really need to look at the contexts around these ideas and the ways they're combined to appreciate them. So I don't like reducing TotK's UltraHanding to just being like Nuts &amp; Bolts, because it's so different. It's in an open world and done with all the materials you scavenge in it, completely on-the-fly (even while riding the vehicle you're building), and can be used not just for vehicles but bridges, automated robots, spinning laser beam emitters, mine carts, bomb catapults, and complex crap like [self-guided missiles](https://youtu.be/GYZQS8Og9MI). And it's all in the context of this open world you're exploring with self-made destinations, so you might ride a motorcycle up to a cliff and then decide to attach a hot-air balloon or fans to it for hovering capabilities so that you can keep using it further. This type of thought process in an exploration game is completely new, and it's a far cry from what Nuts &amp; Bolts did.\n\nWhat makes TotK special for me is the magical gameplay loop. It feels so unstructured and yet I never run out of things I really want to do and places I really want to go. And it keeps drawing me into these super beautiful gameplay moments like following a dragon down a chasm, or having a random pirate ship invasion battle in the sky with self-made sky boats, or transporting a statue's eye through a dark mine shaft and riding its rails. Saying it's \"4 areas\" and \"koroks\" and \"collect materials\" seems to ignore the whole essence of the game.",

I don't think anyone would turn down a better story in any game. Again, for me personally, as someone who values story higher, none of the games you listed outside Portal which I think does have a good story, are a game of all time contender. For others who prefer gameplay only, that's a pretty solid list you have.\n\nI do think most if not all of the games you listed were at their time of release doing something unique or new but do you judge a GOAT contender in the context of release or in the context of all games currently in existence?\n\nI think doing something new at the time of release gives it more weight in the greatest of all time argument but you could argue it's simply the best of all games in existence. TotK is better than BotW in most aspects but BotW brought uniqueness and newness to the franchise and open world exploration. I'm enjoying TotK way more than I enjoyed BotW for a lot of the reasons you listed but it's not that fundamentally different from BotW and BotW had much of the same exploration essence you're describing with the exception of you can build now and go into the sky, and caves and underground. Which makes sense, it's a sequel.\n\nAt the end of the day, greatest of all time is subjective but I'd argue the majority of people lean towards judging games in the context of what they did at the time of their release. Metal Gear Solid V has better gameplay than all the previous mainline games but 2 and 3 are more highly regarded and I think there's plenty of examples like that, even looking at Zelda. Ocarina of Time was the most highly regarded 3D Zelda up until BotW came out.",

For example, if your game emphasizes worldbuilding, it's a lot harder to explain away  random obstacle courses or obvious game mechanics. You are much more contrained by what seems logically possible in the world you created. \n\nLikewise, if you end up emphasizing the gameplay and still want to have an amazing story, you have to find ways to weasel all the game mechanics into the narrative or else you have to deal with all kinds of inconsistencies between gameplay and story. More story also means you tend to spend more time listening to dialogue and less time actually playing the game.\n\nThere are exceptions to this, like Portal 2 but this requires a particular style of narrative that isn't a suitable approach for every type of game. Like you said, it's a matter of preferrence whether you think story or gameplay is more important. But I dont think putting more resources into the story automatically leads to a better experience. I for example think a Mario platformer would be in no way improved if it was interrupted by a complex narrative between every level, regardless if how good the story actually is.",

There's lots of ways to do story, especially in a game which makes it so much more flexible than movies and books. It is possible to do both great like you said for Portal 2.\n\nGo the other way and imagine Mario games with zero story. No princess to save. Luigi isn't Mario's brother, he's just an alternate color. There's no characters with no personality, it's pure gameplay, get to the end of the level, get the star. Probably still fun, but a little less magical.

But across the collective opinion of everyone, I would guess that TotK didn't innovate enough to be in contention compared to BotW because so many aspects are exactly the same. There will always be an asterisk that BotW did it first and affected the genre of open world games, even if TotK does things BotW did better.\n\nHaven't played Disco Elysium yet so it very well could be, I don't know.

I've historically really enjoyed Zelda and I like a good open world game (Elden Ring is a top-3 all time), but I've found BotW and now TotK *very* hard to get into. I can logically see the parts of the game that people find engaging that don't click with me, but the best game of all time is a tough pill to swallow.",

Even if it never reaches the hype for me, I want to have a positive experience. I think the copy/paste comparison for me comes down to the gameplay loop and the feeling of progression. Elden Ring is focused on combat, and I find that combat to be sublime, so when I go through a side area with some deathtraps and dudes to kill, I'm loving the moment to moment. And especially on my first run, I knew I *might* find some new weapon that would transform my build, or at least get some upgrade materials. No matter what, exploring some path was going to get me *something* in addition to just being fun.\n\nZelda's formula feels very unrewarding in comparison given the structure of the game. ER definitely had some crafting item pickups that I knew I'd never use, but Zelda feels like that way more often to me. And more importantly, I really do not enjoy the way the combat feels. I know the strength is in the creativity you can apply to every scenario, but sometimes I just want to do some good dodge-n'-swing combat and in that aspect I haven't been able to make it click.",

The sheer lack of meaningful reward is my one major gripe with elden ring outside of the awful overtuning of late game bosses\n\n&gt;While each cave in Elden Ring can net you new weapon which completely changes how you play the game\n\n95% of the weapons you pick up you literally never use and aren't suited to your current build. stop the cap. At least with a shrine the blessing of light ALWAYS is useful and a korok seed always increases your capacity. A weapon can always be useful and fused to something more powerful.  The smithing stone system paired with the generated feel of the caves and the fact that they reused so many bosses really halted the rewarding nature of elden ring, and I have the platinum for it. It usually went \"oh boy another Ulcerated Tree Spirit guarding another magic spell I won't use, at the end of catacombs halls I've gone down 40 times already\". If I got a weapon I was disincentivized to switch because i'd have to pour literally over A HUNDRED THOUSAND runes into it just to get to the same level as my current weapon. \n\n&gt;leads to different ending or super obscure lore detail or NPC quest\n\nI'd wager less than 5% of caves ever do this \n\n&gt;since it's Souls game you actually never can be sure what's there in the end.\n\nsince it's elden ring and they added too many caves you were guaranteed to run into a boss you've already slain. Joseph Anderson put it best in his critique on elden ring - the first time you fight a dragon it's this special, immense fight that naturally happens on the map, but by the end of the game you've fought dozens of them and the magic has completely diminished. Elden Ring has 169 repeated boss encounters. even Godefroy, a fucking main path story boss, is repeated in an evergoal. Elden ring is one of the best open world games but easily has one of the biggest problems with repetition undermining the exploration. remove 40% of the mini dungeons and stop repeating bosses in a combat focused game. The game already has an awesome amount of unique boss designs - why have ALL of them repeat outside of like 10????\n\nBy comparison, the puzzle and shrine variety in tears of the kingdom is vast - I've yet to hit a shrine that doesn't have its own unique hook or novelty and I have found 110 of them. But in reality, both games have their share of repeated content and both should have been paired down more. Though the Elden ring is worse for it - diminishing the spectacle of boss fights in a souls game is a true crime, and the mini dungeons were all so similar. they just became exhausting with no individual hooks",

The combat focused souls game has more enemy variety. shocking. zelda isn't a combat focused game. ER ONLY has combat, so it damn well should have more. \n\n&gt; I've done like 12 playthroughs of Elden Ring with over 1400+ hours at this point. But I never felt the incentive to replay BOTW and I'm half way through Tears but I won't be replaying it again either.\n\nI have the inverse experience. ER loses its magic on repeat playthroughs easily, where as botw and totk still are fun on replays because the side content is still meaningful\n\n&gt;\nRegarding weapons, why would you ignore 95% of the weapons?\n\nbecause nearly every single person who plays elden ring doesn't replay it and you're funnelled down to one build per playthrough. you are teh massive exception here lol\n\n&gt;\nI had like 15 different weapons levelled up by the end and was having the time.\n\nthere are 300 weapons in the game, so this proves my point. most \"rewards\" never go to use in a playthrough. on repeats, you're going to focus on caves that give something specific for your build and not clear ever minidungeon. again, in totk even on your 7th playthrough every shrine is useful, where as a faith spell isn't useful on your third playthrough when you're going pure dex. This is the problem with elden ring's exploration - you have to be the 1% of people who play the game 20 times to even make use of the reward. \n\n&gt;you do realise there are like 6 other videos that dispute and deconstruct that.\n\n saying other people have good arguments against it isn't an argument, what do they say? josephs point of view completely matches up with my own. You've not actually refuted the point that all the uniqueness and specialness of the bosses gets tarnished by repeating them. Elden Ring actively undermines it's quality boss variety by making me fight the same bosses over and over. It's boring and exhausting in a way zelda never becomes.",

Ultra hand is awesome, but I feel it does slow down the momentum of gameplay and exploration. Not that I'd get rid of it or anything. I'd just dial back the occasions you're forced to use it by 15% or so. \n\n3.) Same thing, but Ascend. While it's amazingly satisfying to use to navigate the world, the animation (which yeah I know is basically a loading screen in many instances) is just too.... damn.... long... It makes me dread certain areas where I know I'm going to use it 6-7 times in rapid succession. \n\n4.) Really mild spoiler if anyone somehow hasn't seen how the map has been expanded: **Spoiler:** &gt;!While I do think they're a net positive overall and an interesting change of pace, the depths are butt ugly and the limited line of sight removes my favorite aspect of the game on the surface. That hard to define, \"Ooooh what's that over there?!\" feeling you get every few minutes while running around is what makes all of the gameplay coalesce for me. Idk. Obviously I haven't spent much time down there because I find it really boring and maybe there's way more to it. !&lt;\n\n5.) Probably the most nit picky for me, but I really wish the newspaper quests put a check mark at each stable where you've already completed it. I kept putting that off and I've since run into a problem where I don't know which stables have been completed because I've visited most of them already. \n\nSo yeah that's me doing my best to pick apart what's probably going to be my favorite game when all is said and done.",

At the very end the way Zelda was brought back felt way too cheap and convenient. Link not saying anything about the things he knew from memories was also a pretty baffling and jarring decision. I think BotW's story was slightly overall better, but TotK has much better setpieces.!&lt;. \n\nOpen World: &gt;!The underground is extremely frustrating. Never felt like I had enough lightroots and often times it'd take 30-40 minutes of arduous trecking to find the next one. Even when I figured out that the underground mirrored the top, it didn't make actually stumbling in the dark any more fun. And it very quickly ran out of surprises or cool things to discover. Easily the weakest part of the game!&lt;.\n\n\nCombat: &gt;!Overall just a straight up improvement over BotW. However a few QOL things stuck out. Companions are super cool but I think they're so OP that they're purposefully made hard to call in battle. Hated having to chase Riju all over. Fusing Weapons and arrows could have done with a bit more efficiency in implementation!&lt;\n\n\nOther: &gt;!Without cloning shit, grinding for some of the parts is a chore. Really wish guts had a 100% drop rate. Still not a fan of BotW's armor system having to change for stuff like climbing and swimming!&lt;.\n\n\n&gt;!Slipping on the rain remains one of the most genuinely baffling and infuriating game design decisions I've ever encountered, and should have been removed wholesale!&lt;.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still consider this and BotW to be functionally 10/10s, these are just the things I dislike, but the things I like vastly outweigh the things I don't.",

Story wise at a high level I liked it, it was interesting. As far as actual \"implementation,\" I can't tell if I'm in the minority here, but holy shit please stop with the (at least english) voice acting. It is so bad. Also, btw do you know the story of the imprisoning war??? :P!&lt;\n\nCombat, &gt;!agree, especially with this point: \"Hated having to chase Riju all over.\"!&lt;\n\nOther: &gt;!was hoping there was some sort of armor set mechanic, to quickly swap, but nah!&lt;\n\n&gt; Don't get me wrong, I still consider this and BotW to be functionally 10/10s\n\nI actually fell off BOTW, I was one of the annoying fans that wanted more older Zelda, but TOTK somehow engaged me so much more, I loved it. Part of it might've been accepting the shift in overall design. But, yeah this game isn't without it's faults and I'm curious to see if my nitpicks line up with others.\n\nAnother one is:\n\n&gt;!the fire temple, so annoying, I hated it. Really just annoying to traverse.!&lt;",

            "comment": "This whole situation has just been extremely strangely communicated.\n\nIf they truly only used AI for to ideate before crafting their own words, or to tweak voices, then why was that significant enough to be thrown into the credits? I mean, developers don't normally put in credits for like \"Dave read the local newspaper to get the vibe for typesetting\" or \"we played Portal once and so we had an idea how to do a GLADOS voice.\"\n\nIf they did use AI for a significant amount of asset generation, or used AI to fully create the text for e.g. \"put this worldbuilding information in a newspaper article format\", then the crediting makes sense, but claiming they were fully transparent and open about its use by putting it in the credits post-launch feels a little sketchy given the discussions around AI.\n\nAdditionally, the other problem is that the game doesn't seem very good, with many people noting that the world seemed flat and that the writing was poor. This made it a lot easier for everybody to run with the idea that they used AI as a crutch or to deliver final worldbuilding products, because if the actual product is mediocre even by the standards of fluff assets, and they're specifically calling out utilizing the new tech here, it's hard not to blame the tech for it.",

                    "comment": "Adding on to your last point a little bit, Firmament misses a big part of what made their previous games interesting (IMO). A big part of the puzzle in their earlier titles is figuring out how to interact with the game's mechanical devices, in that you have to fiddle with them to figure out what all the buttons and switches do and then figure out the order of operations to get it to do what you want. In Firmament, the adjunct gives you explicit text explanations of what every single interactable object in the game does. There's absolutely no mystery to any of it.",

Why would it be put in the very end of the credits? Are they simultaneously so impressed by the technology they felt like they *had* to credit it, but also aware of the controversy around AI to the point they didn't market it despite their enthusiasm? And if their statement is true, were they so impressed by the AI it needed to be credited, but it did so little they can still claim the writing is fully the team's?\n\nI don't think there's a nefarious plot here, I just think the way this has been communicated is pretty weird.",

Because the first time anyone heard of Cyan using AI in Firmament was when we saw the credits. Terrible communication from their part, which directly lead to the sensationalized articles claiming that vast parts of the game were AI-generated.",

                    "comment": "The issue I see is the issue of authorship. This is one of the issues that film and TV writers are currently on strike to address: if the AI writes the original script and humans are only brought on to edit/refine, then the authorship is attributed to the AI, not the humans. I don\u2019t think royalties work the same way in the games industry, but in film and TV, AI authorship is a way that studios can avoid paying residuals to writers. It also opens employees up to all sorts of other abuses and employment instability; rather than being kept as full-time staff, they can more easily be employed on an ad-hoc basis, being paid by the hour to clean up after the AI.",

Being able to ask the ai to write a unity script and having it spit out something that works is pretty amazing. Sure I could google examples or watch a youtube video, but this is a lot faster.\n\nNow, if only the AI could make 3d models and animations...",

Once a studio starts thinking about its artists (writers, illustrators, performers, etc) that way, it\u2019s over. And I want nothing to do with any of those products. \n\nThis shit is even more toxic than NFTs. It will ruin anything it touches by creating a soulless void at the center of games that were once made by passionate, creative people working together. We\u2019re fortunate that the technology also still happens to be bad enough that it\u2019s easy to spot.",

Fine for academic research, not fine for commercial use. Evidenced by the convoluted business structures major players have made their companies into in order to avoid liability (Capped-Profit?!).  \n\n\nIf they were built with stuff they actually had rights to, like Adobe's Firefly was (adobe stock) then a lot of the issues are resolved.",

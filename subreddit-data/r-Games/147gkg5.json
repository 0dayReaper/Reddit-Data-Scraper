            "comment": "Which is great. Xbox NEEDS a stronger Japanese presence on their system. The problem is that a lot of Japanese games just don\u2019t sell well on Xbox. \n\nPersona for instance. Persona 5, golden, and 3 players barely made a fraction of the total player count for those games. The same can be said for basically any JRPG that makes it to Xbox. \n\nThere needs to be a stronger push to get players to try and play those games to truly garner more support from Japanese devs.",

            "comment": "Xbox need to make the better offer for heavy-hitters like Square Enix.\n\nThey reported that they went with Sony due to receiving the better offer from them.\n\nOr else Square are going to continue releasing spin-offs to existing series such as Final Fantasy Crisis Core then wonder why it underperforms and feel less encouraged to port to Xbox more often. \n\nXbox also increasing the cost of the console in Japan in recent months may end up stagnating their growth in Japan in the long term.",

    "postText": "Now, every publisher wants their own headlines and spotlight and they have no reason to put their best foot forward. In fact, because they get more ads the longer it runs, they now have every incentive to put the only good stuff at the end of their presentations.\n\nNobody is competing anymore. They all get their own time, and it's making shit very overloaded.\n\nI feel like I saw about 10 different Sword &amp; Sorcery + Live Service games between Sony and SGF and I'm not impressed. Only one of those will end up being memorable. And E3 required people to cut the BS and only put the very best in the limited time frame they had.\n\nFor being the 3rd year of the Next Gen I've seen absolutely nothing that looks innovative yet. It's just Last Gen+.",

The only difference was having a journalists floor which got worse and worse each year as they let more and more non-journalists in and search engine optimisation for being able to Google E3 and being able to see all the presentations.\n\nIt died because it was obsolete. Games companies can get all the info to consumers and journalists online now. The presentations were useful pre streaming internet era for journalists, but once it got online, it was only a matter of time before a developer pulled the plug and ran their own show when they wanted. Without Nintendo and Sony's commitment to it, it was always gonna die.",

Watch any Crowbcat video on E3 presentations and you'll realise that a key requirement for participating in E3 is to condense all your cringe in one package so that they can play that shit back-to-back before showing 5 minutes of gameplay. Every time I saw E3, I thought \"This could've been a 5 minute video. The fuck is this C-tier musical group doing here?\".",

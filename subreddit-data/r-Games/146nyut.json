Without any of the unique processes and supply chain management of beans to get it from farm into the customer's hands (farms, washing stations, roasting, brewing methods, burr type, puck prep, consistency, etc), it just leaves me the impression that this game is a generic shop management simulator with a coat of coffee paint.\n\nI normally wouldn't say anything about a miss like this; but as a coffee enthusiast, this ticks me off.",

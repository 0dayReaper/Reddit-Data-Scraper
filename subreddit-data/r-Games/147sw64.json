Now it\u2019s a Horizon clone? Why would I ever play this instead of Horizon? \n\nJust a bizarre choice.",

A different take on that formula could be interesting, maybe. I love Horizon but there's still room for improvement. Nothing wrong with a bit of competition. The only other current open world racing series to my knowledge is Need for Speed and that's not quite the same thing.",

            "comment": "Basically they took their original car/plane/boat racing game and decided to use its name for a Forza Horizon clone. \n\nIts so damn dumb. The Crew was unique because you could race not just cars, and because its map was the whole USA. You could drive from coast to coast if you wanted too.\n\nWhat makes this even dumber is that this game can't possibly hope to compete with Forza Horizon. FH has much better driving, better customization and custom races. Why would anyone want to play the cheap knockoff? Plus being a Ubisoft game it will probably have tons of microtransactions and premium currency.",

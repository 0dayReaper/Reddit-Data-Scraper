You don't know however what it contains beforehand.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\"The combination of money and addiction is gambling\", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGeens now wants to prevent that these kinds of funtions will be in any games going forward. \"But that takes time, because we have to go to Europe. We will definitely try to ban it.\"",

However, the wording of this implies a loophole that Blizzard has taken advantage of before with Hearthstone in China.\n\nBlizzard can still \"sell\" loot boxes in Overwatch with a ban like this in effect if they simply sell Overwatch currency for buying skins; a relatively low amount that happen to come with a free loot box. Therefore it is argued that you are purchasing the currency rather than the loot box, even when its clearly for the loot box.",

            "comment": "From Gamasutras [article](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/310188/Belgian_officials_decide_yes_loot_boxes_are_gambling_and_theyd_like_them_banned.php) on this topic, in the comment section.\n\nRamin Shokrizade:\n\n&gt; \tI advised the EU in 2013 that these were gambling mechanics, and showed them how they were being deployed by companies like Disney to very young children. At the time the UK was spearheading regulation for the EU. Now that the UK is in flux, it looks like the EU is leaving it up to Belgium to take this on. The EU will ban this content, certain large Western companies will try to find ways around it, and the EU will not mess around. They will sanction. \n\n&gt;If you are a regular reader here at Gamasutra, then you've known this was coming for years. Major companies (that don't seem to follow the news) have been acquiring labor assets and equipment to optimize their gambling operations and that means they are going to be even slower to adapt to the changing environment. Sure, your virtual world was a lucrative place to drop a casino, but there are children in your games unless you want to make your games adult only, which I don't know of any gaming company that wants to do that. \n\n&gt;On a personal note, I'm kinda looking forward to playing games again, without having to walk through a casino to get to them.\n\n&gt;The specific game I showed regulators in 2013 at the ICPEN summit was Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, a game made for Disney by Gazillion Entertainment, with overt gambling mechanics (including a roulette wheel) aimed at very young children that may not even be of reading age. As I hinted at last week, I suspect someone tipped Disney off to this ruling in advance and the Disney/Gazillion breakup was damage control, four years late.\n\n&gt;If you look at the link to the VTM article, you will see that European parents are waking up to news reports showing Star Wars Battlefront 2 (with some amazing animation btw) along with the included gambling mechanics and interviews with regulators. This is an amazing amount of free advertising for both Disney and EA, but not the kind they want. This must be catastrophic news for both companies and (as I've been hinting this year) I think you will see that the financial forecasts for both companies were optimistic because they did not anticipate this happening despite it being four years in the making.\n\n&gt;This bewilders me since when I gave my report to the ICPEN in Panama in 2013, the vice president of Disney was sitting three feet from me. I had dinner with her the previous evening. As soon as she was done with her presentation calling for \"industry self-regulation\" (and we can see clearly what that means) the German chief regulator started asking her why there were gambling mechanics in her products for young children and she fled the conference immediately. The writing was on the wall, I don't understand why they waited for the EU to torpedo their product line and brand image.\n\n&gt;When I got back to the USA after the ICPEN summit, I was asked to present at GDC 2014. I was double approved for a talk on children's monetization, the ICPEN summit, and pending regulation. A panel on monetization ethics that I was on was also double approved. Then at the last moment both were cancelled without explanation. People keep asking me why I don't talk at GDC, and this is why. The gaming industry correction I have been warning of is about to double down, but it didn't have to be this way. Even games without gambling mechanics will be affected as parents, media, and legislators begin to demonize our industry and make alternate purchase decisions.\n\nI love how the Disney lady scurried away from the conference after being asked about giving gambling access, already back 2013. They knew its fucked up.",

It will only lead to EU specific releases of games.\n\nBasically the game version sold in EU will mostly still have the shit grind that is meant to make you buy loot boxes, and the version for everywhere else has the grind + lootboxes. Publishers definitely don't want to make the non-loot boxed version seem more fun than the p2w version.\n\nIf it goes through in the EU I hope more countries follow outside the EU, but if it just goes through in the EU there will still be way too big a market outside the EU to just stop lootboxes completely.\n",

At the same time EU and US internet is so \"culturally\" interconnected that it would be almost impossible to make EU into another China with its separate set of rules. \n\nHard to tell at this point how far this will go, but if there will be a will on EU side it can without a doubt bend gaming industry to its will. And if that's gonna happen it will almost definitely affect US consumers as well. ",

I'd probably go so far to say that in the 10% chance they don't adjust the grind and just IP lock the game, they'll just not sell it in Europe. For the AAA games that's not possible, but smaller releases likely wouldn't see anything across the pond.",

Because that would be a LOT more like trading in your chips to the casino to get your cash winnings.\n\nAlso: You can directly buy the cards you want to create a deck by spending a half hour on ebay. \n\nI'd like to see you go to a casino and buy a winning hand from another player.

Opening random packs for many IS the game or at least a major part of the game. In video games it's usually just a side thing. Something that is there to make the main game feel worse. Even if you take away all the pay to win and grinding aspects of it. In the end it's a system that pushes players out of the game and into game menus. That's where we \"find\" our loot and where we usually open it. It's a game system that takes you out of the game. In its core it's bad game design.",

Magic for example has \"drafting\" and \"sealed deck\" where each player opens packs and builds decks from the cards opened. In that sense it's not particularly different from any sort of in-box deckbuilding game. Moreso, a large portion of the game's development is designed around any certain set's draft format to make it balanced and decrease the feel-bads of someone opening god cards and winning off it.\n\nI tend to agree with the arguments that tcgs by and large are sort of gambling, but at the same time people have made really fun sub-games within the flawed system so it's hard to say outright.\n\nBut I also play Japanese gacha games, so my opinion is that the whole lootbox stuff is gambling-adjacent, but not exactly gambling in the same way. I remember reading a while back about someone coining them \"microgambling\" to exemplify the difference, and I kinda liked that, because this stuff is close and needs examination/regulation, but I don't think its exactly completely needs to be banned or anything as well.",

People know what they are getting, it's not deceptive.\n\nThe insidious thing about lootboxes is that they are snuck into the games. It's deceptive. People playing battlefront or shadow of mordor don't want to play a trading card gambling game, they want to play a fps/rpg. But it's essentially forced upon them through p2w grind mechanics, while at the same time the publishers deny it's a gambling scheme. It's deceptive and manipulative and aimed at children, and it ruins the game for people with no interest in gambling. Which is why it's pissed so many people off.\n\nTrading card games are like a casino. It's gambling, everyone knows it's gambling. You go there if you want to gamble, and people are appropriatly cautious. If you're not interested in gambling it has no impact on you, and you're not likely to be sucked in by proxy.\n\nLootboxes are like building an amusement park but you have to gamble for credits to go on the best rides. People don't want to gamble, they want to go on the rides. Most people just get pissed off, while a small minority of whales get addicted and sucked in to the scheme. Everyone loses except the amusement park owner who makes more money.",

I was pretty bummed out about it back then because arcades were the shit and made commercial sailing bearable. \n\nOn one hand I'm glad that we might scare some sense into shitty practices in gaming but on the other hand I'm worried about the measures hysteria-prone countries like mine might take.",

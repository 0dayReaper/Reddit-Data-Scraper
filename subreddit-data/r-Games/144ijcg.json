I played a ton in the first year but eventually tapered off after year 4 or so.\n\nMy friend jokes and says \"If you've never hated DBD, did you ever really love it?\" since we were all obsessed with the game and each have a specific era we didn't like.",

It just some... dude. And then they added more regular people. Like that KPOP star who is just some Asian dude that likes to kill people. And even when they added Scream I was like... it's just a guy... \n\nKinda killed the mystery of the game.",

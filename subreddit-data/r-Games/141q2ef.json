            "comment": "That seems like a low number.  If we assume the series started in 1991, when Street Fighter 2 came out, that gives an average of about 1.5 million sales a year. The series has had so many games, on so many platforms, including numerous releases, I would have thought the series was approaching 100 million instead of 50.\n\nI think this shows the growth and shift of the industry more than anything.  SF2 had arcade sales in the tens of thousands, and was a hit.  For a hike release today, a AAA game needs 100x the sales to be successful.",

The biggest IPs have usually been massive sellers, but for any other fighting games which don't fall under that umbrella they're usually lucky to get a few hundred thousand sales at best. It's no secret that the reason most fighting games sell is that people want a game based around the property in question, not specifically a fighting game in general. \n\nIf NRS made a Mortal Kombat action adventure game, most people would be on board, so long as it had the characters they like and brutal finishing moves. It's a genre that's always succeeded in spite of what it is than because of it; most of those copies are owned by people who have a surface-level appreciation of the gameplay but who don't actually get how they work on any meaningful level. \n\nIt's one of the reasons you don't see any new AAA fighting games by other developers, they know that the space is occupied, and no other original properties can really nudge their way in. But if some random company reveals a new souls-like or action adventure game or whatever, so long as it looks neat they'll probably sell a few million. It's easy to look at the few at the top who won the fight of the 90s, see their sales and say they're doing great, but that also ignores the hundreds which died in the fight for people's attention.",

Multiple times, even. None of them did all that well (Shaolin Monks did alright but still, only like half the sales of the main games at the time). Admittedly, that was pre-NRS, but still",

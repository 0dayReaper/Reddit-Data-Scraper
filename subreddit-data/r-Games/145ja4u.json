Don't you find it interesting that nobody ever stops to think about *why* we have things like 40 hour work weeks, or weekends, or child labour laws, or any form of workplace safety regulations? Nobody ever wonders *how* these things came to be. It's like they just assume that things must've always worked this way. Or maybe they think everyone just had a reasonable discussion of the pros and cons then politely agreed that this was the most efficient system so we'll all go by that.\n\nAll of these things that have become the norm were fought for like you said. And the capitalists and ruling class fought against them all tooth and nail. These weren't efficiencies or mutually agreed upon rules. They were *concessions* that had to be extracted by the working class at the end of long, brutal struggles. \n\nBut since then the narrative has been shifted and people seem to think that business owners have somehow changed just because they don't all look like the monopoly man now. People think that we can't change anything about the system we work in now just because it's been this way as long as they can remember, and for some reason that means it *has* to stay the same, forever. It's like we can't even imagine a world where work is easier for everyone because that's either not possible, or if it is possible it would actually be bad. Like whenever there's a suggestion of a 4 day work week or a minimum wage increase it gets a huge backlash, even from people who would directly benefit from it. CEOs and brand managers will write these long winded articles about how inefficient it would be, or how it would destroy the economy of the whole country, if not the whole world's economy. And people will just take them at face value and go along with it! \n\nWhen you could go back to like the 1800s and find some tycoon writing the exact same argument about how we can't ban him from using child labour because it would be bad for business! What do you want to tank the economy *just* because multiple children get horribly mutilated by the machinery in my linen factory every day? It's like people read that and come away thinking, \"Hmm well I don't like that we have a Child Murder Factory operating in our town. But it would be bad for the economy if it had to shut down because we forced the owner to only hire adults and pay them slightly more than he was paying the children. Oh well, I guess nothing can be done about it and we shouldn't change anything ever. Let's get back to shovelling these kids into the coal oven.\"",

There was a huge boom with demand during covid, but recently they've been in a downturn, with rates being barely enough to cover the cost of fuel. Probably not the best time to try turning this into a real job",

                    "comment": "I'm a former trucker myself. 95% of trucking companies want at least 6 months of experience. A majority want at least 1-2 years of experience. The entry companies are insanely terrible to work with. A majority of them will screw you over as fast and often as possible. They'll treat you like you're literal garbage at all times. The pay will be garbage. You can make more as a security guard than many of the entry jobs. \n\nAlso if you go a few years without driving, a lot of companies won't be easy to take you back. They want recent experience only. So they won't put you with a driver trainer for a week or whatever to make sure you're good to drive. They will flat out not hire you instead. Not even entry level companies will take you after a few years of no driving because they'll want you to be a recent truck school grad. I have personally been out of trucking for 5 years. Even though ive got a couple years experience in addition for 12+ years of other professional high level experience in other careers, almost no companies will accept me now unless I do another month long training session with a shit company like CR England where they literally yell at their drivers for no reason, as ive been told by many of their drivers. Their pay is also a joke. By the way, most companies lie to some degree about their pay. Almost all of them do.\n\nI have seen ten year drivers who suck at driving and lack common sense with driving safely, and ive seen newer drivers do extremely well. To me it doesnt feel like the industry is hurting that bad for trucking. A lot of companies still pay vastly under what drivers should make for that sort of job. Truck parking across the country is a giant FCK you to drivers, as most lots are full by 7pm but your company wants you to drive every minute possible to make your load on time, so youre often forced to park in places where you shouldn't and then get tickets for doing so. \n\nThen you gotta deal with random inspections from state troopers where they treat you like garbage. If you have a maintenance issue, your company would rather route you 6 states back to their home terminal to fix it with their in house mechanics for cheap instead of fix it at a local repair shop, no matter how dangerous the issue is. And if you refuse, they will fire you and accept any risk from getting fined by DOT for that termination.\n\nA lot of smaller companies will lie about pay greatly and expect you to run illegal if possible. If they actually pay good, there is generally reason why (such as if the truck has issues and etc). One company wanted me using two different e-logs (older truck engine doesnt require plug-in tracking) in order to run illegally driving 16 hours a day. It also had an engine leak. I wasnt ok with either one. Asked about when we could fix the engine leak and minutes later they told me that it wasnt working out and to park the truck at a nearby truck stop(without reason) and find my way home. This was in Maryland and I had to find my way back to Tennessee.. Luckily a taxi was able to take me to greyhound.\n\nAfter that experience, I got a job hauling water tankers in north dakota oil fields. None of their trucks and trailers were registered and they wanted me to haul only over weight. I didnt even have enough money to leave. I was basically trapped. They also lied about pay by 50%. I saved up just enough money for a plane ticket and left. They were shut down a month later. Went back to Tennessee and couldn't afford my rent, but luckily a friend got me a job in Texas. Went to Texas doing the same thing as north Dakota. The company constantly harassed me and forced me to drive broken ass trucks falling apart on the road at up to 100,000lbs weight (texas oilfield weight exemption). I quit there after a few months and havent returned to trucking since. Been out of it for 5yrs or so. By the way, I can take a lot of shit. I have thick skin and I believe a good work ethic. I was a leader in the Army and dont have an issue working hard. A lot of these companies are the scum of the earth.",

After graduation you go straight to basic, this will be the tutorial level. While there, you're given the choice between buying a Charger or a Mustang (RPG elements!) on a loan with 37% interest. After basic you propose to your high school sweetheart and promptly impregnate your now fiancee. \n\nLevel 2:\n\nThen you're off to your first deployment. Thanks to scoring exceptionally high on the bell curve while taking your ASVAB, you're stationed at a weapons depot in central Kansas. Your best gal can't follow you just yet, she's off to college, but you write letters to each other because it's romantic to do it the old fashioned way. Also, since you're on graveyard shift it's hard to find time to talk on the phone. The job is okay, much more sweeping and mopping than you expected when thinking about going into the armed forces, but Staff Sargent Brooks says you're critical to the operations of the base \n\nFast forward a few more months and you're given the opportunity to get transferred to southern Texas. That puts you even further away from your fiancee, which means she can't drive down and visit on a long weekend like you talked about maybe doing some day. But, she's so busy with the new baby she probably couldn't make it anyway. So you go. \n\nLevel 3:\n\nWhen you arrive in southern Texas, the first thing you realize is how hot it is. The second thing you realize is that the exciting 'security detail' you signed up for is actually being a security guard in front of a warehouse. You don't know exactly what's in the warehouse, and you get the feeling you'd get an ear full if you ever asked about it, so you leave it be. It's not the most high paced job, mostly checking officers credentials before buzzing them in. But hey, at least you get to carry a gun, and your CO said he'd see what he can do about getting you a stool to sit on.  Eventually you get another letter from your fiancee, the one bright spot in your days of monotony. Even though you're on regular hours, you kept up the letter tradition, mostly out of momentum. But this letter is different. The envelope is thick, and there are multiple sheets of paper inside. You already know what's coming, but you read on anyway because you're a brave soldier.  The baby, who you've yet to meet, is now being raised by her mom. And your fiancee officially leaves you, saying she doesn't want to waste her college years tied down to a man she doesn't even get to talk to\n\nLevel 4:\n\nYou're devastated, and your army buddies take you out for a few drinks after your shift. You've never drank on a week night before, but what the hell? This becomes a bit of a habit, but what's the big deal? You're young, everyone has a bit of a drinking problem at this age. On social media you see your high school buddies going to crazy frat parties all the time. You try and focus up on work, but all you can think about is those airplane bottles of fireball you've got stashed in your bunk. This goes on for a few more months, you're not really struggling with alcohol any more, you've managed to fit in into your daily life in a way you're pretty sure no one can notice. You've finally settled into life on base, you've got the friends you see at the bar several times a week and you're even dating someone you met at the gym! Her husband is deployed, so you have to keep it a bit of a secret. She says a divorce is on the way, but since he's overseas that complicates the paperwork. Or something, you're not really clear on the details. \n\nLevel 5:\n\nAnother year passes and you're single again. Turns out she went back to her husband as soon as he returned stateside, but it was good while it lasted. At work, you've managed to memorize every detail, down to the number of windows and doors, of every building you can see from your post inside the glass box next to the entrance to the warehouse. You never did get that stool.. The days are long, and the south Texas sun is hot. Eventually your mind wanders, imagining a scenario where you, a lowly warehouse guard would save the day. Of course, if any bad guys made it this far that would mean they could either blast their way past an entire US military base, or their fake credentials were good enough to get past the three other checkpoints just to get to this warehouse. But you could stop them.\n\nThe next day your CO comes up to you and commends you for doing such a great job keeping our nation safe, and hands you reenlistment paperwork. \n\nWould you like to play again?

So I learned to drive I get a job at the bottom level and I work for 5 years until I'm replaced by a drone or automated truck?\n\nThis is actually the one industry where I think automation is necessary. Automated trucks and drones don't need to sleep, they don't tire, they won't need to stop at truck stops to eat and rest. I know this will kill the business of truck stops across the country. But it will improve logistical efficiency to a point where we've never seen before. Which will ultimately lower the cost of transporting goods.\n\nWhen I was a kid my dad was a truck driver and I thought it was amazing going on a ride with him and stopping at these random truck stops and seeing the countryside. So it's sad that this job will become 100% automated at some point. At least for Long Haul Trucking. But humans weren't made to sit in trucks for 14 hours a day. \n\nThis will also reduce maintenance on these trucks as computers will drive a truck perfectly for maximum efficiency reducing overall fuel cost and maintenance cost. \n\nBut I don't know anything really I'm just some dude on a toilet.",

Automated or not, trucks will still need fuel/chargers, and unless/until some new service industry pops up to take care of all truck needs (daily inspections, un/loading, route planning [even truck gps's make bad choices at times], safety checks, inclement weather, unexpected issues, etc), you'll have someone traveling with the vehicle at all times (though likely paid even less). Potentially they'll be able to sleep while on the road, but realistically they're going to be expected to be present and alert behind the wheel all the same.\n\nIn the US most trucks are limited to 80 000lbs gross weight, but in other places you have trucks pushing 160 000lbs.\n\nCurrently they have trouble with rear collision avoidance (sensors not working OR stomping the brakes on the highway for a plastic bag and sometimes nothing [like fog/mist/mud]).",

Then they started showing popcorn commercials. Some people complained, others were like, \"Hey, it's relevant to the movie going experience, it's not really a commercial\". Then they started showing commercials for butter and Pepsi. People who saw what was coming complained. The more complacent said, \"Hey, it's relevant to the movie going experience, it's not really a commercial\".\n\nThen came the car ads. And the cellphone ads. And the cartoons went away, and we paid for the privilege of being advertised to.\n\nIt seems like stuff like this is ok at first. That's how they get you. Then a year later your game is full of billboards and commercials because corporations care only about profit, and don't care if they negatively affect gameplay, just so long as they can squeeze another buck out of gamers' pockets.",

That stuff is easier, traffic is moving, not as many variables. Also these tests are always run to big distribution centers like UPS and USPS.\n\nThe bigger difficulty will be in navigating smaller cities, narrower roads, and delivering directly to clients where any number of obstacles could occur. the other struggle is successfully backing up the truck to an unloading dock. There's theory that self driving trucks will for awhile really only be in use between big hubs in a carrier's network, then all final deliveries (last mile) will need to be human. Or even, trucks will navigate to a specific area of a lot, at which point a human driver will jump into the truck to do the final bit.\n\nThe biggest obstacle will be regulation. California has already banned autonomous vehicle operation without a licensed driver inside. So as states regulate ( or don't) the landscape will be volatile.",

That makes sense... in fact it would be stranger to not have ads plastered all over the arena.  The logos and shit make the game more realistic.  It doesn't make sense to be running around in Assassin's Creed Valhalla and then see a billboard for Pepsi somewhere, and fortunately we don't really see that in games.\n\nFor something like American Truck Simulator, I wouldn't mind billboards containing real ads because it's supposed to be a driving simulator that takes place in the real world.  Billboards are everywhere in the real world, and billboards are already in the game... they're just advertising fictitious things, or at least they were up until this.  This from the screenshots shown is tasteful, as long as you're not seeing it literally all the time because it's the only paid ad the game has that I'm aware of.  This fits and it makes it more realistic, although admittedly with it being the only paid ad as far as I'm aware of while everything else in the game is fictitious, it does look more out of place than it does in place.  It doesn't work as well here as something like a sports game because a sports game typically doesn't have fictitious ads and logos everywhere so all the real ones fit together, where as this one isn't as natural by nature of everything else being fictitious.",

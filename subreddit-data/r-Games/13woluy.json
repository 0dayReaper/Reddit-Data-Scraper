They just want to slam around in multiplayer and have fun. But they got bored real fast of only a few cars and... two tracks? And I didn't fancy playing it myself just to unlock more for them.\n\nThey just went back to Mario Kart and haven't touched it since. Why would they? Mario Kart gives them a slew of cars, characters and tracks without unlocks, and unlocks can be gained in local multiplayer. Feels like a total miss on the devs tbh. Most people who would likely play a Hot Wheels game are kids, why go for the super grindy approach?",

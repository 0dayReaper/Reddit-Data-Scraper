And Armored Core 6 is sneaking in that period as well... At least the rumor of September for Spider-Man 2 isn't true... \n\nAnd I still have that backlog (which incidentally include finishing DOS2 and replaying The Witcher 3 among others, many of the games on the list being long in themselves)",

Thats excluding the smaller releases like Darkest Dungeon 2, Metroid Prime remastered, Octopath Traveler 2, etc. \n\nand were still due Final Fantasy 16, Armored Core, Balders Gate, Starfield, Mortal Kombat, Alan Wake 2, Spiderman 2, Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty, and again a bunch of smaller releases + like Assassins Creed, FIFA, CoD, etc which are also always big releases for a big part of the market. \n\nIve never seen a more stacked year. and the fact that most of those big games have been 8/10 or higher is even crazier. None of them flopped so far. Weve only seen ports like The Last of Us flop. Even BLIZZARD didnt flop it.",

[That is what the COC console command is Center On Cell, it moves you to the center of the cell you give.]\n\nIts really, really not uncommon for games to use cell systems or otherwise parcel out their playable areas and most games have it to some degree or another because it just makes it more convinient for a lot of reasons. It helps you identify areas based on location, it lets you parcel out areas for assigning and work. There's a lot of reasons.",

Very few games I buy early access, this and subnautica were my purchases that went really good for early access. Devs always updated on stuff and let you know what was coming out next.",

Like, okay that's cool but what about the other districts and parts of the city? That was one of the better things about both Amn and Baldur's Gate in the first two games, the cities were huge and had different districts which clearly served different purposes both within and without the game's world.\n\nEdit: lmao you guys cannot react to any kind of criticism and it's honestly pathetic.",

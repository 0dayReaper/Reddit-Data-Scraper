Generally, salaried workers earn better base pay and are expected to just work however many hours are necessary to get their job done.\n\nIf extensive 'crunch' time is needed to get a project done, companies can choose whether or not to offer some kind of overtime or other bonus, depending on how much they are worried about burnout or mass resignations. In game dev where there's a long queue of eager young people wanting to work in their 'dream job', this isn't something that bothers a lot of developers. \n\nIn the non-game software industry, it's taken more seriously and you generally don't find the kind of employee abuse that we hear about in game development. It still happens here and there, but it's not 'normal'.",

For ops folks, if you carry the \"pager\" you get pager pay and can file overtime for any on call work. \n\nWe're known in the industry though for \"paying below average\" in our field. It's hard to convince people that that job for \"more pay\" may not actually yield a better $/hour.",

It has sometimes been for working weekends or beyond the 40 hour work week, other times like during the last few days I didn't need any hw at the office so I just said I'm working from home because there's no reason to come in at all. In the cases where I had to work longer (a few months ago I crunched for two weeks straight) they let me take the extra hours worked as time off once the deadline was passed.

This is a general feature of \"at will\" employment, which allows both the employer and the employee to terminate their relationship for no reason with no notice (the \"2 weeks notice\" thing is just a courtesy that is not legally required).\n\nWhether or not you are an hourly or salaried employee is a legal analysis, but you can bet that your employer has done that analysis and if you are in a role that classifies as hourly, you are going to be required to punch a time card to track your hours, and your employer is not going to allow you to work more than 40 a week unless they really, really need it. (I happen to work at a job where I'm salaried and I have hourly secretaries, and I've been berated for holding up secretaries into overtime).\n\nThe idea is, then, that if you are salaried, you are given a job and expected to handle it yourself rather than being tracked on how much time you spend. It's theoretically up to you to get it done in a reasonable amount of time, and if you feel like you are having to work an unreasonable amount of hours to get your job done, you have some choices: you can demand a raise or some other compensation to cover your extra time, or you can quit. Theoretically, again, the free market is supposed to handle this problem insofar as good employees will leave abusive jobs and the employer will suffer. In practice it's not that simple, as a lot more calculation than just hours worked goes into the decision to stay at a job - not least the fact that insurance coverage typically comes with salaried jobs, which is majorly fucked up IMO and really distorts the labor market.",

The terms of the contract are that employee will work as a JOB TITLE and get paid HOURLY WAGE/SALARIED WAGE. Hourly, non-exempt employees will have language on how overtime hours work, salaried, exempt employees will not.\n\nBoth will be given direction to finish all their work while at work, with different rules about pay (eg salaried employee needing to work 5/8 hours in a day for it to not count as an absence).\n\nThe \"trick\" is that salaried employees are given X amount of work to do, and told to get it done. If you finish all of X in your regular hours, great. If not, well figure it out. Employee's choice to work additional hours, or not work additional and face potential consequences for not having completed work.\n\nThis shifts the question from \"am I getting paid overtime\" to \"did you complete all your work you were assigned.\"",

In my case, this implies that I must work 40 hours per week, at a fixed monthly salary. Whether or not a month as 21 or 22 working days, I get paid the same. Anything over 40 hours a week must be approved overtime, which happened exactly once (twice, but one of the times I simply refused).",

Technically you can be salaried and nonexempt, but most employers basically determine whether a role is hourly or salaried based on the exempt or non-exempt status of the role.",

There, injuries were common and back in the 40s/50s/60s people would regularly get dosed up on heavy amounts of morphine or other strong painkillers just to be able to work with long-term injuries to hands/arms/shoulders/backs/knees/ankles etc.\n\nKids grew up with Daddy going to work every day and coming home nursing a great deal of pain, and dealing with it with a constant diet of pills. So when \\*they\\* got to their 40s and couldn't afford to take time off, a painkiller addiction was just another sign that you'd earned your stripes in the mine.\n\nSo when Purdue started pushing these new opiates that they claimed were less adictive or even not habit-forming at all, thousands of doctors in these areas leaped at the chance and became very comfortable with writing ludicrous prescriptions that had people taking enough Oxy every day to kill a horse.\n\nWhen the truth became known and prescriptions became difficult to come by, a black market sprang up with the ready-made consumer base in these mining towns. A market both for bootleg Oxys, and regular old heroin for those whose habit was too expensive to maintain on proper pills.\n\nBut the root of it all was this crazy-seeming culture of going in to work no matter how much pain you were in, where the quantity of painkillers you needed was a badge of pride, instead of shame.\n\nMost of this I learned watching '[Oxyana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrE1uxGd6OQ)', a tragic documentary on the subject.",

That way they would get a regular/consistent salary with neither side needing to count hours. As programming became a job some subcategories of programming jobs were fitting for such an arrangement. For programming it meant jobs that rely more on occasional trouble shooting while otherwise having less to do (like some highly critical but mostly eventless server admins).\n\nOf course companies then just ran with the letter of the law and not the intent. Meaning that all salaried programmers were shoved into this category that was supposed to be used for a specific group of employees, just because generic programmers technically also checked off all the criteria.\n\nSo instead of being a salaried employee (at 40 hours per week) where you get overtime pay for any extra hours (and or weekend work) they get just that and no overtime pay.\n\nCompanies still have all kinds of irregular bonuses (like video games companies giving bonuses for high rated or well selling games) but the fundamental \"salary is payment for 40 hours of work\" thing seems to be useless due to those laws that were supposed to be only used for employees in specific situations.",

During crunch we don't get overtime pay, but the extra time worked is taken off after its finished. If I work an 80 hour week instead of 40, then after crunch is finished I get a week off. For me that's fine, but I do know people who would rather overtime pay than time off. Same goes for if we end up needing to get something out and it can't wait and we need to come in on a weekend. If I work Saturday and Sunday to fix some stuff that couldn't wait till Monday, then I'm going to be taking Monday and Tuesday off.\n\nI'm sure it happens that people are called in, work a lot of overtime and don't get paid or don't get time off. Know your rights. That's illegal. It might be your dream job, as it is certainly mine, but don't let yourself be exploited. If it's happening, know your rights, talk to a lawyer.",

It's not right but that's how it works today.\n\n&gt;For the FLSA section 13(a)(1) exemptions to apply, an employee generally must be paid on a salary basis of no less than $684 per week and perform certain types of work that:   \n&gt;  \n&gt;is directly related to the management of his or her employer's business,   or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is directly related to the general business operations of his or her   employer or the employer's clients, or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;requires specialized academic training for entry into a professional   field, or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is in the computer field, or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is making sales away from his or her employer's place of business, or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.\n\n[https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/overtime/info.htm](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/overtime/info.htm)",

Basically, there is a range of senior engineering expertise where these salaried positions make sense and the people in these positions are *generally* pretty well compensated.  \n    \nThe problem is that the rules built for this relatively narrow subset of senior technical employees is being applied broadly to exploit a broad swath of other employees to which it should not apply.  \n  \nAnd the salaried model seems completely hilarious within the game development space.  Outside of a very limited range of managerial and administrative positions it makes no sense in that sector.  \n  \nSource: was in gamedev, am now in one of said engineering positions, salaried, and very happy with it.",

I get crunch, I get deadlines but saying that \u201coh we need to get 1.5x-2x work done so we\u2019ll just plan to have you work extended hours for the next 2 months\u201d is both bad for the workers but ultimately also doesn\u2019t work. After a period of time you become less efficient and it compounds over time. Not to mention that most game studios don\u2019t really give bonuses especially if they aren\u2019t doing well, so then you end up in a situation like I was at in SOE where every next project becomes more and more critical with more crunch and less time leading to worse games which ends up not doing well and then it\u2019s back to the next critical game that has to save the company. At least SOE treated the workers they had to lay off extremely well when they finally did have to shutter studios (unless you were part time).",

We were sat down as he dryly read off his slideshow presentation that someone else had obviously made for him. There were a couple of very interesting slides though:\n\n1) The company was making \"record breaking\" profits. The company's cash flow had been climbing higher than it had ever been after several years of good growth and the expectation was that the growth would continue in a sustainable manner.\n\n2) The company was *not* offering raises to any of its employees this year because they wanted to be conservative with their money.\n\nHe breezed past that second slide pretty quickly. I was there for over half a decade and never got a raise. Those few that did got usually got small ones that barely mattered. This is not even the worst company I've ever worked for.\n\nBring on the unions, please.",

Labor needs representation and protections. My job is SO much more humane and reasonable to work in than anything I've experienced before and the union is directly responsible for a lot of that atmosphere (we're lucky to have great management here as well to be fair). \n\nJust like any other organization, unions can be poorly run, rife with corruption, etc. etc. But my perspective now is that we're out of balance, at least here in the U.S. Especially in more vulnerable, lower-income sectors. Work-life balance is just out of whack for a lot of people and stronger unions and the protections they allow labor to negotiate for are a big part of bringing that back in line in my view.",

And while there is a need for personnel for these kinds of situations, overtime is often uncompensated because workers are usually salary.  In cases where overtime is paid, it\u2019s cheaper for the company to pay overtime than hire more people for big events because it costs them more in benefits and training time. This means that typical staff are grossly overworked during rocky periods.\n\nLest anyone say \u201cthese are just video games\u201d, I would like to point out that this is a bigger industry than movies and TV (just talking games at this point, not even mentioning tech organizations like Google, MS, Apple), and there are already unions for film and theatre workers.  \n\nFurthermore, gaming companies have been posting record profits, while companies like Activision have been doing large scale layoffs. The CEOs and executives of these companies make absurd amounts of money and there is no shortage of money to go around. \n\nI recommend everyone watch Jimquisition and his video on crunch, particularly the one on \u201cBioWare Magic\u201d:  \n\nBioWare\u2019s disgusting crunch:  \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GN1uV57hE_w\n\nCrunch in general:  \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RT14-lyqofA\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=p15k1F5zfV4",

It really isn't. Everyone isn't just coding. You also have level designers, systems designers, producers/managers, writers, scripters, sound designers, QA, and tons of artists and modelers. Creating 4k assets takes a ton of time. So you either have few assets, low quality assets, or you have to hire tons of artists. \n\n&gt;But for the cost of experience, they can throw 4x the amount of devs at the problem.\n\nThe problem isn't that the regular developers are inexperienced. The problem is that the managers and producers will be. While no one really talks about them that much, producers are insanely important to game development. A good producer keeps things on track and going in the right direction, and knows how to focus and deploy their team most effectively. Without a good producer a lot of projects just become a gigantic mess. Look at Star Citizen. And this is something that really only comes with experience. It's not something you can solve by just throwing bodies at.",

We're one of the last New Sectors for capital, so you've got an attitude of wild west personal liberty. Any \"new\" capital sector is not yet \"optimised\" - more of the money slips through the cracks to workers. This engenders a \"well I got mine!\" mentality in older workers who landed six figures with stuff they learned online. As the sector transitions to traditionally maintained capital, labor cost is forced down - the sector is more \"efficient\", producing the most value for the owners. As we're outsourced further and there are more and more underemployed IT workers, striking gold is far less likely, and you're starting to see some push for worker's rights.\n\nTo put it simply, the mountain is full of ore. The early miners were self made, so why isn't anyone else? Must be lazy.

Turns out those Congolese kids are a lot more difficult to manage and aren't really as capable as talent that comes from countries that actually have real developer education and resources; and in countries that actually *have* been investing it's still a crapshoot whether you're going to get good developers or if you're going to get people who are just riding the gravy train for as long as they can (which is an *enormous* problem with developer resources in certain countries unless you're paying a premium -- and if you're paying a premium why not just have someone onshore instead?).\n\nThese realities are a large part of why companies were pushing so hard for H1B expansion in more recent years instead of just moving jobs offshore for cheaper.\n\nBetween 10 and 15 years ago I worked at a multinational Fortune 100 that tried *twice* to get serious offshore development farms off the ground and working for them.  It failed *both* times, and they've since changed their strategy into identifying employees already working for them in non-developer roles that they could train into junior-level developer positions instead.\n\nAnd it's well worth noting that, as a multinational, they have operations in multiple countries -- they have development groups in each of those countries too, each primarily serving the needs of the business within that same country.  The education gap for offshoring might lessen as the years go by, but the management and logistical gap of offshore development isn't going anywhere.",

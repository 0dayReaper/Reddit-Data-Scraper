When I read that they were going down a more open-world route and focusing on replayability, crafting and incorporating weapons I feared the worst as it seemed like they were moving away from what made the games (Dark Descent, Soma and even A Machine for Pigs) unique and turning into something much more generic.",

(ime, an hour of that was spent fighting stupid AI in the final sequence)\n\nThe game is less scripted than TDD, but the bits that are scripted are much worse, so it becomes tedious\n\nre replayability the ending &gt;!is rolling out of the bunker and either seeing the monster run off into the night, or you killed it in the previous scene!&lt; unless there are more endings to be discovered",

What made Rebirth great for me was the worldbuilding; the character's story was still good and had some extremely interesting alternate endings, but this whole other-world they had going on was morbidly fascinating to me. It's true that the protagonist crying over her husband wasn't really riveting or anything...but ive always felt that people focus on that to an extent that leaves them overlooking what is, in my opinion, an extremely unique and interesting setting.",

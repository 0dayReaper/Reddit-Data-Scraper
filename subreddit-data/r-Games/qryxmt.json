    "postText": "First off, there's a reason Rockstar showed next to no gameplay of this game. \n\nThink back to any recent release and they've always done a gameplay overview, but obviously that's not the case with this remaster. \n\nAdd the fact that theres still a review embargo in place, Rockstar knew exactly what they were pitting out. \n\nIve played a few hours of San Andreas on GamePass, and good God are there a boat load of glaring issues.\n\nWhy is there even an option for fidelity and performance? A game this old should give you the best of both worlds. \n\nOne of the most frustrating is the fact that when it rains, you can't really see what the hells happening on screen, as the streaks of rain look like theyre white, not transparent. \n\nThis is a prime example of a corporation trying to pull a fast one on a loyal fanbase. \n\nI know this is just the reddit echo chamber but if this dissuades even five people from buying the game, its worth it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI got banned from r/games for criticizing Game Pass in a separate post. Feel free to check my comment history. I wasn't console warring. It was a more than fair comment that led to discussion. \n\nThe mods in this subreddit have a huge Microsoft bias. Be warned.",

            "comment": "This is completely unsurprising to anyone who knows who worked on this remaster.\n\nGrove Street Games, as they are now called, originally were called War Drum Studios.\n\nThey've been hired by Rockstar in the past to make X360/PS3 'remasters' of GTA:SA and mobile ports for their various other games which are of...very dubious quality. \n\nMuch of the additions and changes they made in these ports were either of poorer quality compared to the original (e.g. really shiny textures on character and car models which looked weird in comparison to everything else in the game which were flatter/matte-shaded - don't know the correct terminology), bugs that weren't in the original games and have not been fixed all these years later and also some performance issues. Plus the same problem with lazy texture work leading to typos and misspellings.\n\nWhen I saw the name 'Grove St. Games', I thought, \"Huh, maybe that's a new studio that Rockstar have opened up.\" Then I looked it up and realised who it was and I thought, \"Welp, this is probably going to be at least a bit shit\". Turns out I was wrong. It's *very* shit. Very shit indeed.",

So console version doesn't have analog controls\n\n-They added a new broken windshield texture and called that an improvement\n\nedit: I'm talking about the 2015 remaster not the Definitive Edition, the controls are obviously better in the brand new one",

Sometimes characters have two skin tones at the same time.  \n\n\n\\- The dancing mission, like the lowrider one and the one at the beach have weird delays so you have to smash the button a little late to get the perfect score, if you hit perfectly it will say that you missed. I don't know how they broke this, but they did.  Prepare to fail a lot of dates that involves dancing.  \n\n\n\\- We only got one phase of the moon at all times.\n\n\\-  CJ swims way slower for some reason\n\n\\- The sounds were heavily compressed and they all sound like shit, like a flute being played by Shrek's asshole.\n\n\\- They changed the water texture and you can literally see the textures loading in front of you while swimming on flying a plane above the water.\n\n\\- If you drive a car too fast on the countryside the game starts to show a graphical corruption at the edges of the screen.\n\n\\- They increased the draw distance fog to 200% - you can't see anything when you are above a building or something high.\n\n\\- The minimap takes forever to load.\n\n\\- The flying school lessons are completely broken and sometimes they crash the game, so you have to hold the button to skip the cutscenes otherwise the game freezes.\n\n\\- You can't cycle your bike at regular speeds, because the touch controls can't detected how strong you are pressing a key so you always cycle your bike at max speed.\n\n\\- They absolutely destroyed the gym minigames. They straight up don't fucking work. Just search for them on Youtube, they are ridiculous.\n\n\\- The game now has a autoclimp feature so CJ climbs anything that you touch, even accidentaly. It really screws you over in some missions.\n\n\\- The burglary side missions are completely broken and you get stuck inside the houses.\n\n\\- The vehicles don't have special animations anymore, like the bed of the garbage truck or the forks of the forklift, nope, they don't work anymore, it's not like we need them for missions, right? /s\n\n\\- Everyone has broken facial expressions. CJ doesn't open his eyes most of the time. Tempeny has a broken lip and Pulasky has a sore eye.\n\n\\- You don't lose your weapons if you die anymore. So this made all the girlfriends in the game pointless because you only got this perk after dating one specific girlfriend, Katie.\n\n\\- You can't take pictures anymore.\n\n\\- The game has less civilians around because they don't know how to optimize a game.\n\n\\- They basically removed all vegetation from the game, you can cleary see that desert is empty and dull now.\n\nAnd countless other bugs just in my experience, fuck War Drum Studios or Grove Street Games, whatever they are called now. And these are only the bugs that I've experienced, there are videos that are 2 hours long just talking about these bugs.",

There are literally people in this thread going \"Yeah this is bullshit, and I'm not buying it until they get all this crap figured out\" and it's just like...you agree doing all of this is wrong but you're still going to reward them with your money?\n\nJust wait until physical game releases are finally killed off, then all games are only available digitally and some even gated behind subscriptions. Then you're gonna start seeing some real shit. Maybe the only thing you get to purchase is an unfinished base game that needs patches to play, but you don't \"own\" the patches, so they can be removed from your console/PC remotely at any time, leaving you with your purchase: an unplayable game. Hell, this is already sort of the case with some physical games. Think about how many games were buggy or unfinished at launch, and how many discs have been created with those launch versions on them. Patches can still be downloaded now, but one day that'll get shut off, and once you can't download the patch data anymore, that buggy unfinished game is all that's left.",

Honestly surprised nobody else has called this out yet.\n\n[AI upscaled text looks like this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/811809/56570576-82d81600-65bb-11e9-9333-a7aea390bdf7.png). You'll notice it looks completely different from the signs in the screenshot, and is additionally _really obviously an AI upscaled texture_.\n\nAll the things an AI upscaler would not do to these textures:\n\n- remove the guitars from the background\n- Fully change the font on the Colins Guitar sign\n- **change any of the text content into something totally different**.\n\nAI doesn't work like this. Those signs are the product of human error or disinterest or bad calls, 100%.",

They made [nearly $1billion](https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/05/take-two-rides-catalog-sales-and-live-operations-to-841-1-million-in-revenue-for-q3-2020/) revenue in 2020 for a game that came out *eight years ago*.  Shame doesn't effect their bottom line. They don't give a shit.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nI'm not trying to victim blame, but Rockstar will keep doing this shit if people keep buying this shit.",

Not a sniff of GTAVI, the last game that entered development before Shark Cards / GTAO was big (RDR2) is now past us, and the remakes of their crown jewels of their GTA series get a fucking mobile port with some removed music and broken textures for its \"Definitive\" 20th anniversary.\n\nI'm pretty sure Rockstar will be fat and bloated and past it from now on.",

In the meantime I'll be playing SMT V so I won't be done with that for quite some time.\n\nEdit: gonna edit this to briefly explain what SMT V is: (quite a few people asked me).\n\nShin Megami Tensei (and this release is the fifth one).\n\nJRPG that is (more or less) Pokemon but with demons, desolate narratives, etc. World is ending/changing permanently as per the demons' wills, etc. You often have a choice in which narrative pathway you can go down (like siding with different factions, etc).\n\nAnd it's AWESOME. Usually has incredible music (5 looks to be no different). They are often very long games, tons of content and are not cake walks by any stretch. They are often difficult, but fair and not crushingly difficult to outright cease progression.\n\nyou can often get a version of the Devil/Lucifer/Beelzebub to join your party (often after a very difficult fight). Stuff like that. You can get Metatron and he's a metallic guardian angel, you can get Michael the archangel and Raphael, etc.\n\nEdit 2: Pokemon is similar to SMT, not the other way around. SMT came first.",

Without them, reviewers are heavily incentivized to drop their reviews as quickly as possible after getting the game, maybe only opening the game up for half an hour. What we need is the review embargos to expire before the game is released. Also, the game needs to be given to reviewers with enough time to look at it. None of this 50 hour rpg delivered a day before release (dunno the exact situation with gta remaster).",

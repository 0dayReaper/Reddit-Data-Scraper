            "comment": "This was more or less my takeaway from reading the Invasion blog post. It seems that they\u2019ve pivoted from a single purchase PVE mode with skill progressions to a bundle of a few missions that they will charge $15 for when they drop. Admittedly, the $15 does seem to include enough in-game currency to buy the Battle Pass too, but it still seems like they just wanted to be able to monetize the PVE content in a more long term manner.",

People interested in Overwatch are already playing and I doubt some dunno 30 minute pve mission, or two? Are going to get people to install it again.  I probably would have for a full pve campaign with skilltrees and what not, but not this.",

            "comment": "The headline makes it sound like they've uncancelled PvE. That's not the case. OW2 was supposed to have campaign and PvE (Yes. The campaign is PvE in the same way Archives and Junkenstein is) but the mode Blizzard called \"PvE\" which included: talent trees, power progression, hero missions and was supposed to be highly replayable, was cancelled. The campaign however is staying but being broken up and drip fed within their seasonal model.\n\nPrice wise it's not actually that bad. You get the 3 missions, 1000 coins and a legendary skin for $15. If you're one to buy the battle pass then it's really only $5 for the missions and a skin. If you ONLY want to play the campaign missions then 3 missions for $15 is quite steep. They're only 30 minutes long and aren't going to be highly replayable as far as we know. The campaign was always going to be paid, so this shouldn't shock you if you've been following it. Instead of one bulk release, it'll be drip fed over time. 12 missions = $60. 12 missions sounds like a full campaign to me and $60 is a full game release as well.",

Not everything should be about the Jedi Order, the Empire, or the Republic. But almost all Star Wars content is.\n\nFor once, I'd love to play a game from that universe where the position of the game on the timeline is almost irrelevant except for atmospheric purposes. The Empire will be around, and they suck, but the game isn't about them. They're there doing something else, and we don't really care as long as they don't care about us. That would be great.",

To hunt down the remnants. When we're talking about a plotline ten years after Order 66, there should be basically no one left. At least, no one willing to identify as Jedi (like Obi-Wan in his show was acting at the beginning).\n\nThis idea that every time we turn around there's a surprise Jedi buddy to save our skin defeats the purpose of that *entire* organization. \n\nThe only reason Obi-Wan was able to survive is because he abandoned everything about the Jedi ways. The majority of the show Obi-Wan is so out of practice that he's useless with the Force. That also kept him out of the line of sight, though, too. The idea that there's surprise Jedi all over the place kind of spits in the face of all of this.",

Sure, they invented the stupid battle pass, sure they don't have a shopping cart on their store or whatever and sure, exclusivity sucks (but every major company has tried this: Activision/Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft in that you still need to activate your steam games on Uplay, Sony). Microsoft might be the only exception. Epic has, whether it's a \"marketing trick\" or whatever, benefitted both consumer and developers, with their funding programs, free games and pc platform competition to steam (the last one remains to be seen i guess).",

Those brands could easily match or exceed the combined donation bid and call it a day. It would be a rounding error of 'loss' at worst, and more than likely an easy tax writeoff for them and means they don't have to do something else down the line.  \n\nI probably imagine that there's a large bureaucratic hurdle between the social media team on Twitter of these big brands, and the higher management that can actually authorize a big donation from all the stakeholders, fast enough to be able to donate for the bid.  \n\nFeels like not just greed, but poor business planning. Or I guess whoever the social media team is, they messed up their jobs by stepping in when they know how hard it can be to actually submit a donation for them.\n\nOr maybe even those big brands were like: \"You know we could easily outbid those little guys and get our names on the box, but this way if we don't step in, those little guys get to look good and get their name across\". \n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

There's different types of aiming, which are used differently in different games - for example think about tracking a moving target with a assault rifle or whatever. Its a very different skill to flickshotting something with a sniper, which is different again to tracking a target while strafing yourself, etc. \n\nAlso not every game works like CS - using a automatic gun in CS is all about recoil control, spray patterns and stopping while you shoot, which isn't very applicable to something like COD or a movement heavy game like Titanfall for example.",

Similarly, distributing review copies at release was also probably a considerable task considering the thousands of codes that were sent out to streamers (and the many more thousands of requests from smaller streamers that they presumably got during that time), was that also all done by \"one guy?\"",

After fully refining their game, they launched it in a very smart way: having the game added with PS Plus and choosing several streamers to have drops on (meaning when someone visits their stream, they have a chance to get the game for free). \n\nThese two factors were a one, two punch in terms of marketing. The streamer giveaway tied to an indie game (published by devolver so quasi-indie) led to what felt like an incredibly organic explosion in popularity. This allowed them to maintain one of the top positions on twitch for weeks. Even now it is at 245k viewers. The only games around there are Call of Duty Warzone with 274 (currently having a tourney), Fortnite with 170k, GTAV with 175k, League of Legends with 219k, and Minecraft with 336k (currently having a twitch rivals event). The PS Plus gig however was a different form of marketing. By giving it away for free on one platform, it led to massive word of mouth to spread, in turn leading to people wanting to purchase it on PC.\n\nAt this point, the game had its launch set. Upon launching the game skyrocketed with popularity due to the word of mouth generated from this initial marketing campaign. It quickly got articles written about it, had tweets galore, and a very unique graphical style with bright CMY colors which would make it eye catching on any news feed. This is sort of the 'phenomena' phase, where the game's popularity progressively exploded across reddit, twitter, and other social media but also in more traditional media settings. \n\nThen came phase 2 of their marketing strategy: the twitter account. The official Fall Guys twitter account was pushing everything forward by retweeting stuff and being savage (similar to what wendy's twitter does) which allowed for a rapid sense of growth between the community and the creators. They then had a fundraising for a charity. This caused even more madness and further fed into the news websites as it could then attach other massive brands to this game and massive amounts of money. Ultimately the winners were G2esports, Ninja, Aimlabs, and Mr Beast. Now they have all of the communities which would be associated with those brands spreading more attention to the game. \n\nBut they didn't stop there. Just a couple days ago, they had an appearance at Gamescom for the Season 2 teaser which was fed by the hype from above, but now gives people something to be hyped for with regards to this game but *for a month from now*. This allows them to continue marketing the game's season 2 and maintain their position in the news. \n\nBut this popularity wasn't just due to clever marketing. The game itself is incredibly addicting. It features a series of Mario Party-esque minigames with usually 4-6 rounds which progressively eliminate opponents until there is only one left. The minigames are goofy and require some platforming skill but also have a good amount of physics based mayhem with swinging objects, rotating platforms, and obstacles. Players also can mess with each other and troll which allows for great interaction in what is otherwise a very straightforward experience. The multiple rounds system is also interesting for the BR scene as it enables you to squeak by in the first rounds and focus on winning each individual minigame rather than a grandiose plan across a whole match. \n\n**TL;DR**: A very good start with clever marketing on Twitch and using PS Plus. Then the devs leveraged organic growth in popularity through their twitter and news websites. But its popularity is not due solely to marketing as the game stands on its own merits.",

It's simple, reminds me of a very basic Mario Party (which, god forbid any remakes or a decent version comes out), it's cute, and it was free.\n\nI think the bar has just been set really, really low with the amount of games that you need hours to learn to get any enjoyment out of it. A lot of developers have lost the ability to make a game you can just pick up and play, the old \"easy to learn, hard to master\"... to be honest though, the rewards for winning are pretty lame, the satisfaction is probably the biggest reward, which is... well, it's different, if nothing else.",

It's less frustrating to ultimately lose at the end of the game when you've qualified for/won multiple rounds up until that point. In contrast with something like Fortnite or Apex where you only really get a sense of winning if you ultimately are the last person or squad standing. The \"qualified\" screen, music, and sense of accomplishment when the other competitors fall away fires at the reward centers in the brain and really encourages you to keep going. Plus rounds are short enough, and the presentation makes everything feel fun and low-stakes, dissuading players from feeling grief or tilting too hard.",

With Fortnite or COD you feel like you have to be the best of the best to have any chance, but with platformers the field is more level so everyone had a shot.\n\nBut this game's been popular for quite a while.

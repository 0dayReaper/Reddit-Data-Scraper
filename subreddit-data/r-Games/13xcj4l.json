They do not sell tickets in person anywhere, so you must use their site. The site does not allow you to use a foreign credit card for payment while in Japan. I had to call my parents back in the states and have them purchase my tickets with my card info back home. Then, to top if all off, you cannot use a digital version of the tickets to get in the park and you must print them out on paper, so I had to spend time figuring out how and where to print these tickets in Tokyo. What a mess.",

Through the 90s and early 2000, Japanese consumer technology was outpacing the world, any new phone innovation would come from Japan first.\n\nIt's because of this 10 year lead that Japanese phones had on the world that this was when the most impactful years of the internet would form also, And having the first phones that could browse the web made the internet grow hand in hand with Japanese phones.     \n\nAt this point I'm not even sure why things are so stagnant, maybe everyone still uses Japanese phones for primary web surfing device",

Perry, the Meiji Restoration, and the post WW2 miracle were cited as examples of the two settings so to speak.\n\nParaphrasing and using some of my own words, \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it. If it IS broken, leap forward dozens of years in the future in a blink.\"",

I know there was a change to Japanese courts where they introduced \"lay judges,\" who are members of the public that help with adjudication. It's not quite a jury as know it in the west, but it's a step in that direction.\n\nEdit: I say \"in the West,\" but I really just mean the US and other Common Law counties. Plenty of other Western countries don't use US-style jury trial/adversarial systems, but rather inquisitorial systems (such as that portrayed in the AA series).",

Japan can hold someone until they confess, the USA can hold them for years before they give them a trial. For an innocent person, it's often better to just plead guilty and get started doing the time, rather than wait ages for trial and then probably lose and have to do a longer sentence on top of that. Prosecutors and judges in the USA will reward people who save their time and just plead guilty, they don't care whether they're innocent or not. Awful systems in both countries.",

It's 100% a sequel to SA2--one story with every group intertwined in it, the best level in the game is also the first level, almost all of the sound effects are stolen straight from SA2, you collect emblems after levels and side missions like SA1/2, the camera is ass, A rank scoring system functions the exact same way, basic mechanics like the homing attack are a total tossup whether or not they function just like SA2, rail grinding is completely dysfunctional (just like SA2), and after every story you access a final story with the true final boss. Oh and the exact same plot too--Eggman tries controlling a power that rebels against him and is gonna kill everyone. \n\nLike you dense bastards, it's SA3. And here's something more mindblowing for you Sonic fans--SA4 ALSO exists! It's Sonic 06, which also hits every point on that list but leans slightly more to SA1 since it actually has hub areas. Really buggy and incompetent hub areas, but it sure has them!\n\nWhat you actually want is SA5, correctly designed and not hideously incompetent like SA1/2 were.",

Compare the SW prequels to LOTR, which in comparison relied much more on practical effects, and there's just no competition. In most cases, LOTR looks much better. Reliance on CGI and green screen is one of the prequels' greatest weakness.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who was 6 when Phantom Menace came out (and loved it), and thought Attack of the Clones was one of the best movies I'd ever seen at the time. I can't even finish AotC anymore due to how bad it is.",

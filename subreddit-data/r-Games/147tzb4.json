            "comment": "\"The most ambitious Star Wars game yet\"? It's certainly different from most others, but based on what we've seen this is nowhere near the calibre of something like Force Unleashed, Jedi Survivor, Republic Commando, or KOTOR. Let's cool it with the hyperbole, there's still plenty of time for Ubisoft to Ubisoft it.",

The playable area seemed fairly sizeable, assuming it's not just a narrow corridor the speeder went through. And there's certainly ambition in making a game with fairly seemless transitions from inside a building to jumping on a speeder towards the next town and then flying off into space.\n\nFrom reading through the interview, \"most ambitious\" is not something the devs ever claimed, that seems purely on the author.\n\nAlso, I'd argue that the MMOs, Galaxies and The Old Republic, are the most ambitious Star Wars games.",

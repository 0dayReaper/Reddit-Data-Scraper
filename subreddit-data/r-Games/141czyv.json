They released synergy DLC for it and put money into the project. There's nothing else they'd need to do.\n\nThis is literally based on a thought someone had: \"whoa, I didn't know Square published this.\" And that idea is re-stated within the article, then claimed to be a purposeful move without any evidence. It's filler for their site.",

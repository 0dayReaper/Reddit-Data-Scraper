Whereas in jwe1 you had to put up parks on different islands. \n But sandbox mode (aka build your own park at your own leisure ) is a lot of fun and hella improved. You can tweak the experience entirely to your likings these days. That said jwe games is more about building pretty parks and look at gorgeous animated dinsosaurs and not super in depth when it comes to park management etc.\n  \nIf you're into visuals and creative part of park building it is quite fun, but if you expected super in depth management and gameplay; you might end disappointed.",

I played pretty much every single release from 2K6 to 2K17, then dropped off to only buying them dirt cheap every few years. MyCareer has regressed in quality as they pump it with more and more predatory bullshit, MyTeam became more of a grindfest to encourage extra payments. \n\nIt's shame that Live fell off so hard that 2K is the only option. There's no pressure on them to improve anything. Games journalists have completely dropped the ball too, with big outlets just giving them an 7/10 minimum every year despite how aggressive and obvious their anti-consumer practices are.",

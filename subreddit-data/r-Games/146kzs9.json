    "postText": "Hey Reddit, I'm super excited to announce the demo for RAD Survivor is available now. \n\nI've been a full time indie dev for some 12 years now, but this is my first solo game doing absolutely everything (code, art, animation, design, music, sfx, etc.) I appreciate there's now dozens of whatever this genre is, but I'm hopeful you'll find RAD Survivor has it's own unique flavor that sets it apart. \n\nYou can check out the trailer and grab the demo [HERE] (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2298180/RAD_Survivor/)\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n* Light survival elements- Resources are plentiful and it's mostly a conceit to keep players moving through the level, since there's an...\n* Interactive environment - Set off unexploded nukes, ride a two headed cow, light tumbleweeds on fire, eat totally legal mushrooms &amp; praise the sun\n* Save your progress mid-run - Bunkers strewn across the wasteland allow you to save your game and escape the dangers of the night.\n* Dynamic soundtrack - Different instruments move in and out of the mix based on gameplay events (Kinda rudimentary for now, more to add)\n* Bonkers Mutations - Every power/mutation in the game has a 'bonkers' form to unlock after enough kills. For example, the Chicken Butt mutation allows you to lay explosive eggs, but once unlocked, 1/100 eggs or so will hatch a redneck in a chicken suit that kicks enemies offscreen for 1,000,000 damage before flying back to his home planet.\n* Vampires - Actual vampires.\n\nIf you give the demo a spin, you have my sincerest thanks and please let me know what you think. In all likelihood this will be lost in the flood of other 'Survivor' games, but I've worked my butt off on it so hopefully someone plays it and thinks it's cool. \n\nThanks for reading!",

I did see that come up when I was doing a test search for RAD Survivor on Steam, but honestly hadn't considered that RAD could be contested by virtue of how many other games have used it. I hope they don't come for my $0!",

The survival aspects are mostly just there so the player keeps moving through the level and can't stay in the one spot, but the ideal balance should be that there's enough pinata that you essentially collect resources incidentally as you're managing enemies and collecting rads/xp, so if it's not there yet it's definitely good to know.",

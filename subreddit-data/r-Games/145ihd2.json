Being a woman on mic fucking *sucks* on average. Either you deal with that shit or don't use mic at all, which is a pretty large additional hurdle that men/male-presenting voices don't have to deal with typically.\n\nPersonally I just do premades and skip out on that hostility, but it does significantly limit the windows where I can play team games. I imagine for other women, it's the same.",

Whether it was Apex, Halo, CoD, Don't Starve, 7 days to die, ff14, dead by daylight, etc etc the list goes on. Either there's alternative systems, text chat, or not essential.\n\nI've ran into like *two* games in the past half a decade where voice was all but mandatory and those were Squad and Phasmophobia. You really don't have to engage with voice if you don't want to.\n\nStill sucks that it's preferable not to use voice regardless",

Series creator Yoshiyuki Tomino has noted in a few interviews over the years that women were the ones who originally came out in support of the show, and that they started frequently having several waiting for autographs with the cast after recordings. He further elaborated that the series didn't seem to score big with men/boys until the model kits were introduced, and joked that he wished they were there from the start so maybe they could have kept their full series order.",

Many, many girls feel the same way. It's an extremely common sentiment, which is why a lot of girls stick to friendly games (i.e, Nintendo) so they feel safe.

Unless you're counting only FPS's as \"real games\" or saying that \"real gamers\" have to be a part of that community this point is moot. It has nothing to do with about half of gamers being female. It also has nothing to do with a bunch of people on here that are okay with pushing girls out of \"their space\" not literally knowing girls who game and using that as their evidence that this stat is wrong. \n\nUsually, us girls who do play games do not talk to bigoted idiots like that and we do sit in MMO team speaks silent because we don't want jackasses like them to harass us. Games are a hobby and should be fun and relaxing. There is nothing fucking relaxing about being sexually harassed in a game because some idiots have \"never seen a girl gamer before and that's hot\" when the girl gamers just don't want to talk to them because of this. \n\nMany single player games exist. Many rpg's and Jrpg's exist. Many creative games exist. Many expressive games exist. Not all people are drawn to games you have to play with people and surprise, a lot of the single player ones are attractive for girls. Your point is moot unless you are conceding that you think only games where you play together and can definitively tell whether who you are playing with is male or female are real games. It seems to me as if you feel, for some reason, you happen to be the arbiter of what is a video game. This is not the case and bringing up the demo of all games not being about half women is not a cogent point to the topic at hand.",

Maybe it's an american thing i don't get, but there is no possible way this is true where i'm from. I think it's so silly that whenever someone casts doubt on some unknown survey then people are like \"haha you don't know any women!\". Like what are we in 7th grade?\n\nAmong all my friends' wives and girlfriends i know of a single one who owns a gaming PC. A decent amount own switches. All my male family members play video games, my female family members don't. My dad will play a bit of video games, my mom has never played one ever i think.\n\nOf course plenty of women play video games. I don't get pretending like people are claiming they don't. What people are claiming is that for example among PC gamers there is absolutely no chance in hell that women make up 50% of the playerbase like this survey claims.\n\nlet me put it like this. I've never met a guy below the age of 40 who didn't play video games, or used to play a lot. I've met a lot of women where this was the case.",

This is just my personal experience so not a very wide or deep statistic, but I know a few dozen people with PS5s, only one is a women. I know a few women that have their brother's old Xbox and a few that have their own Xbox but 3x more of my friends with Xbox are men. There's one friend on my Steam friends list that has a gaming laptop, the other women use Mac Books.\n\nI and my friends are pretty nerdy, men and women, with DnD groups, people talking about games and stuff, etc.  Some of these numbers just seem incredibly off, aside from the Switch one. I'm actually surprised the number of Switch owners being women isn't higher as basically every female friend I have has a Switch while most of the guys don't.",

For example, The Sims 4 is not available on Switch and has massive sales, particularly with women, it\u2019s just mostly old news on a gaming forum. AAA marketing blitzes are still pretty male-focused.\n\nOf course there\u2019s also more women than ever playing the biggest games too - Minecraft, Fortnite, and Call of Duty have seen a massive growth in female players. Increasingly, everyone plays the really big titles.",

But she uses a gender neutral username and never uses voice chat, cause she was harrassed non-stop when she did.\n\nMy ex got a Switch when we broke up, cause she loves Mario Kart, and since then, she often picks up indie games she sees on Tiktok. She especially got into Strange Horticulture and Untitled Goose Game. She doesn't really talk about games to anyone because for her they're a pastime, not a central part of her identity. Also, she doesn't love the \"gamer\" crowd.\n\nThey're all invisible to what we consider the gaming public, but they are gamers.",

It took several years of being friends with a coworker and his wife before they finally mentioned to me that the reason he wasn't playing the new PS4/PS5 games was because his wife was \"hogging\" it to play games like Dragon Age, Horizon and Assassin's Creed lol. She's a hardcore gamer, but didn't mention it in public, even when I was talking about games to her husband in front of her. Now we talk about it all the time!\n\nAnother one of my close friends (I was in her wedding) asked me if I could help her troubleshoot why an update to the most recent Sims game wasn't working on her laptop. I'd known her for 10 years, and she had never brought up playing games ever.\n\nThere are two sides of the coin when a survey like this doesn't match up with our anecdotal experiences. Either the survey is skewed, or our anecdotal experiences are skewed.\n\nBut if a survey is talking about 40 to 50% of \"real\" gamers being female, and Sony says similar numbers, but your personal survey is like under 10% female, than you should probably question your own experience.",

If so, then there's a meaningful distinction between a computer that you use to game and a computer that is 'designed' primarily to game (ie. dedicated graphics card, higher end hardware, possible gaudy 'gamer' design elements). Same thing with 'mirror' and 'beauty mirror'. You can use any mirror as a beauty mirror, but that doesn't make any mirror a beauty mirror. Defining 'gaming PC' as 'any PC whatsoever' seems downright meaningless. You won't find one on anywhere that doesn't have at least a card game preloaded onto it.\n\nA macbook isn't even really widely considered a 'PC', hence a full decade of \"I'm a PC and I'm a mac\" adverts. I'd say that they are, but the mainstream would absolutely define PC to mean a windows device. Even 'gaming laptop' has a different connotation. Hence my ability to google 'gaming laptop' and know that I'm going to end up with a specific subset of devices and not a single chromebook.\n\nSpecific objects having specific names is not gate keeping. Even Wikipedia considers them [somewhat specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer).\n\n&gt; A gaming computer, also known as a gaming PC, is a specialized personal computer designed for playing video games at high standards. Gaming PCs typically differ from mainstream personal computers by using high-performance video cards, a high core-count central processing units with raw performance and higher-performance RAM.\n\nPeople that game on a macbook might still be gamers, but that doesn't mean they own a gaming pc anymore than owning a phone with games on them means they own a 'handheld gaming console'. The function might be the same to a degree, but there's a significant difference in form. And within the scope of the survey, there's a meaningful distinction between 'person who games on a PC' and 'person who bought a more specialised PC specifically to game on'. The latter is putting far more monetary investment in the hobby, at least in terms of hardware. It would also likely affect or be affected by that kinds of games they play.",

So the Switch that my mom has, and no one else uses, is clearly female owned.  What about the Switch that my brother bought for his kids?  He has boys and girls that play it.  So, is that Switch a female owned Switch, or is it 50% female owned?\n\nIt doesn't make sense that there would be 3 \"buckets\", female, male, and mixed ownership.  That would mean male+mixed is less than female alone.\n\nThe more likely option is that 52% of Switches have at least one female owner.  The newlywed couple that got a Switch, would add to both a male and female owned Switch.  The family of 9 girls and 1 boy would both count as one switch of each category.  The Switch that two female roommates buy together, would be one female owned Switch.  \n\nIf this is the case, then numbers might be 52% female owned, and 80% male owned.

I think as a genre RPGs and action-adventures do a really good job of this. As a broad generalization, it feels like both men and women enjoy playing games like Zelda, Skyrim, and Pok\u00e9mon.",

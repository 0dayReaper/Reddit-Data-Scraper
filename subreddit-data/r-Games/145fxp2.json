You never have to grind for levels, and if you want to get used to content before joining random people you now have duty support so NPCs can join you for dungeons. They even made early dungeons show you mechanics that will become later. ARR is at worst a little dry thanks to it being setup for literally everything that happens after it, but it's still better than the majority of MMOs when it comes to on boarding you. ARR is somewhat over hated.",

At least the PS5 they know everyone has the same build so they can optimize for memory cache hits and hard code certain elements etc. \n\nIt's either: \n\n(a) Delay the game for everyone for a year to get a simultaneous PC/PS5 release, or\n(b) Release now for PS5 and based on feedback + DLC optimize around PC\n\n(a) Would be outrageous here because Sony invested a lot of money and time into it to make the overall vision come true, e.g. via PS5 specific tech support and organizing a lot of marketing. So we would'nt even be able to entertain option (a) if option (b) wasn't the reality.",

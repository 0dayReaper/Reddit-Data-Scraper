The final one is a like a central hub with 4 separate mediocre \u201cpuzzle\u201d rooms, except they aren\u2019t really puzzles. \n\none room is literally just minesweeper, except the tiles are the floor you walk on and it\u2019s controlled in first person, so if you accidentally back up into the wrong tile (since you\u2019re looking down the whole time) you blow up and have to restart the entire room over again. The others aren\u2019t as egregious as that,  but IIRC, all of them are cases where you figure out the solution fairly early on,  but the challenge is properly maneuvering/navigating your character/the controller.",

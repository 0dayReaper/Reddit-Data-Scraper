            "comment": "With the amount that Ken Levine tosses out old work and overhauls his games whenever his constantly shifting vision changes from another source of inspiration, we can only wait and see if any of Raphael\u2019s influence on the design can be felt, or any even remains in the final game at all.\n\nHopefully Ken Levine is able to get Judas out of development hell and have a consistent vision for it soon, 2K may be willing to fund him after 10 years but they may bring someone in like they did Don Ray for Bioshock Infinite again, and it may result in the project being all the better for it, when Levine was known to yell at his developers for not being able to perfectly match the \u201cauteur vision\u201d in his head.\n\nJudas is looking fantastic so far and hopefully it incorporates the \u201cnarrative legoes\u201d design well, even if it only ended up being another way to describe a choice based story RPG.",

Because my first impression was that it means some kind of random-generated story content, which I just can't see working out well.",

In the interview that all of these sound bites are getting pulled from he talks a lot about how much better this development cycle has been for him and his team. Having a small team with a small budget work for a long time has helped avoid the kind of working conditions that defined Infinite. He also, it sounds like, hated working on Infinite - he tried to leave halfway through, developed (actual) OCD and anxiety, and almost left the industry altogether. Judas has been breezy.",

They've been adding 100 developers every year for the last 8 years.\n\n&gt; glacial progress\n\nThat's definitely the right term for it. Their revenue comes almost exclusively from selling ships, and there's always a new ship every quarter for sale. At least they're actually usable in game most of the time now, not just JPEGs. Its fucked that even with this highly efficient ship creation pipeline, there's still JPEG ships from like 8 years ago that people paid for and they have yet to deliver.\n\nFrom the perspective of someone that has played every quarterly patch for at least 2 weeks since 2018, the real issue screwing development up is they're actually developing two games - a AAA single player story game where the benchmark is Red Dead Redemption, and their stupidly ambitious MMO. The single player game gets priority in terms of features and content, and the overwhelming majority of that is kept hush-hush and not patched into the MMO because they don't want to spoil the content. This includes multiple capital class ships with full interiors, an entire enemy Alien faction with around 10 ships, and an entire star system with 4 planets.",

Its cheap, used to be tons of places you could get a slice for a buck, but most places that did that are around $1.50 or $2 now, still a great deal for a slice.

The drive here comes more from a feeling of \"Wow everyone else is gonna think I look sick as hell in this\".\n\nThey are two different strategies for two completely different types of games.

Conversely, whales in games like Diablo aren't dumping money to get a power boost, they are dumping money to make their character look cooler both for themselves and everyone in-game who will see them.\n\nKinda apples and oranges.",

If your goal is to actually to try to fight back against the current capitalist society and hierarchy in at least a somewhat useful way those are your best options not moralizing consumption.\n\nThe thing is most people in r/games don't care about real change they just want their games to cost them less and they want all the content which is fine but the endless moralization of consumption gets tiring.

Something new and more fun will eventually unseat them as it always does. I've seen a lot of game franchises go from global phenomenon to cult following in my life. \n\nEven more recently Among Us, Fall Guys, and Rocket League all used to dominate the minds of gamers and now they've fallen from prominence. There are still people, a lot of people even, playing these games daily, but they are nowhere near the same level of cultural phenomena that they used to be and that's how games die. It's just slow from this point. Something new comes that's more engaging and people move to that, or the games just become stale. \n\nNone of these games, however, die because of their MTX stores. They just die due to public opinion shifting towards other options. If a game is going to get killed by the MTX it happens long before the game hits massive popularity status. Look at Evolve; decent concept gameplay wise, kinda fun, had over 300 different cosmetic items for purchase at launch, and extra monsters that you couldn't play as unless you forked over the cash. It fell apart without ever getting popular.",

The more popular the game, the higher the price will be (see: Destiny, LoL, Valorant).",

Meanwhile, I can't get a skin in Call of Duty without buying a $15 bundle with a bunch of shit I don't want.\n\nThere are far more egregious MTX stores out there.",

Each year there are fewer ways to earn free BP levels, while the best rewards are now untradeable skins which require a lot of levels (IIRC a few years ago the highest tier reward was an untradeable Windranger Arcana which required over $200 worth of levels). Since these skins are untradeable, you need to splurge during the limited time the BP is available if you want them.  \n  \nEven tradeable items are subject to minor FOMO since Valve started putting trade locks on International items so they can't be traded until a year after they were first available, and items on the market are usually subject to huge inflation over time, so it can cost you as much as a full game if you want to buy any old Immortal items/sets.",

It was loaded with content, free cosmetics you unlocked pretty fast as you played, and all the other things you'd expect from a complete game. Everything they've ever charged money for has been post-release content that probably would just not exist if they weren't charging for it. If it keeps the servers up and pays the UE5 devs it doesn't bother me at all. And at least they got rid of lootcrates.",

Chests are normally obtained for free in certain events (and usually these only give out 1-2 chests), or you can get one free chest per champion for getting an S-rank in a ranked season, but chests have a chance to drop an emote, champion fragment or ward skin instead of a champion skin fragment, you're more likely to get a skin you don't want than one you do just because of the sheer number of skins available, and you still need to earn or buy more chests to get orange essence to turn your skin fragments into an actual skin you can use (and the conversion cost scales with rarity, so even if you get lucky and get a Legendary skin fragment, you need to open a lot more chests to have enough essence to convert it).  \n  \nThe Gemstone/Mythic Essence skins also add a FOMO element by giving out certain time limited skins which can only be obtained with obsence luck or by buying a ton of chests for random mythic essence drops.",

Like, compared Diablo 4, a game with dozens of armor sets in the base game, to Diablo 2, where every character had two sets of armor appearances which got mixed and matched depending on the specific chest you wore. Very rarely you might get a unique helmet that might look radically different from any of the base helmets, but that's it. And there was no changing the appearance of any items, so if your BIS looked stupid, tough shit. \n\nhttp://www.vhpg.com/d2r-armor-appearance/\n\nLook here for images of what I'm talking about.\n\nTwo, many games in the 'good old days', had no cosmetic options at all. It was comparitively more difficult, and storage on the cartridge/disk was more limited, to have a lot of alternate appearances for characters. For every game with even a moderate amount of alternate character appearances, there was probably five other games with zero variation to how the playable characters could look. No customize their physical appearance, no alternate outfits, even weapons often didn't look any different with new equips. \n\nThree, pre-microtransaction games were also pre-\"extensively supported with new content after the release\" games. Nowadays, games that regularly get new content added in the form of dungeons, areas, towns, etc, being added with no additional cost attached, are pretty common place. And selling cosmetics is how doing any of that is remotely feasible. In your ideal reality where all cosmetics are in the base game for free, you're also in a reality where nothing new gets added to any game unless it's part of a paid DLC, and even then the amount we'd ever get post-release would be comparatively small. Path of Exile wouldn't exist as a free to play game with extensively amounts of free new content added, if they didn't have a store that sold cosmetics.\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point. \"Games used to just have all their cosmetics in the game at launch that you could just unlock!\" is the farthest thing from the full story. It's biased, lacks important context, and borderline revisionist.",

Diablo as a game is literally all about the gear grind. And while it's obviously primarily about the stats of said gear, how your character looks is massively important to many players, even without the online aspect. \n\nPart of the appeal of the gameplay loop is simply grinding more and more gear, and \"pointless\" cosmetics plays into that.\n\nAdmittedly, right now the game is new and there are plenty of nice looking cosmetic sets to collect, but I've already noticed that there are maybe 2 gear sets per class with the same visually fidelity/quality as the shop ones, while the other 10 \"free\" sets are very lackluster. [For example on my sorc there are 3 armor sets to unlock that share the *exact same models*](https://i.imgur.com/C1GK5X2.png) (No joke, this counts as 3 different transmogs ingame), meanwhile *there are 3 unique sets on the shop from day one*, but they're locked behind $15 paywalls.",

People who just bought the ARPG instead of people who keep buying the ARPG they already paid for.\n\nFinding neat looking armor is part of the game play. Its just getting locked behind paywalls now so its basically limited to me despite shelling $70 out already.\n\nAnd I'd be fine with it if it was for continued support of the game... But these skins were made for launch.",

They just don\u2019t bother me at this point. $25 for a skin hasn\u2019t been surprising in years, Blizzard is doing nothing here that hasn\u2019t already been done. Valorant charges upwards $100 for skins, and although a lot of people have complained, F2P games somehow get a much bigger pass for high priced skins. F2P or not, $100 for skins is pretty wild, and if being F2P makes that acceptable, where does it end? Would a $200 skin be too much? Either way, fully priced game or F2P, if it\u2019s live service there will be a shop, and $15-$25 has become a pretty standard price tag.\n\nThe one thing I won\u2019t stop complaining about is FOMO, though. I think locking anything behind time gates, like Battle Passes, are the worst offenders. My time is more important and I hate feeling like I\u2019m held hostage to a game because they expect me to play a certain amount to unlock the stuff I already paid for. I\u2019m OK with paying for Passes, I\u2019d just like to be able to unlock the content at my own pace and not lose it. At this point I\u2019ve accepted cosmetic shops in games, but I fucking hate the FOMO stuff.",

Now skins are costing as much as half or even the full game itself. People scoffed and ridiculed Bethesda when Skryim released that horse armor skin for 5$, but now they got a 7$ horse skin in the Diablo 4 shop and Ive seen 2 Youtubers talking about the cash shop and egregious prices but saying the 7$ for the horse skin isnt that bad.\n\nAt the time when skins would normmally cost 1-2$ you would occasionally see a 5$ one at most when it was for a holiday, or special event, or if it was a licensed crossover skin, but thats it.

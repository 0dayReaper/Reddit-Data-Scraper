The juxtaposition of guns is the *point.* are people at such disbelief that their brains refuse to process it? I just think it's funny. The Pokemon-like designs haven't stopped any other Fakemon games on Steam from releasing either. Nintendo doesn't have sole rights to cute fantasy animals.\n\nIf the game comes out and it's bad, I'll lament it. But I'm still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

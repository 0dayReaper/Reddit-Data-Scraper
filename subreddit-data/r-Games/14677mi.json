Why not show it off in the trailer unless your game is actually as bland as it looks?\n\nThis totally misses the point and appeal of musicals by being a trailer of teenagers rambling, Life is Strange style.",

Like this feels like it's a third or fourth trailer about a game everyone already knows and interested in, but it isn't. I think your idea would fit a lot better here.",

But as a MT performer myself, I have real worries about the presentation and tone, of story through song in this.\n\nAt least after watching this trailer. \n\nI wasn't expecting the visuals to be still frames. I think I would enjoy this game a lot more with my eyes closed, unfortunately.",

Everyone are so conventionally attractive and cool. IDK it seems like a marvelization of the mythology all over again with \"badass\" characters with the hollywood type of character flaws and traits.",

From the two demos I played I'm not sure exactly how much hands-on gameplay there is though. Probably more akin to a visual novel with a high budget musical/VA talent.",

            "comment": "Thank you so much for posting our trailer, kind stranger!!  Here's a little bit more about our game for anyone interested:\n\nWe\u2019re Lowbirth Games, an indie studio in Montreal getting ready to launch our first game, a third-person narrative mystery game called \u201cThis Bed We Made\u201d. Today is a pretty big day for us as IGN just published our game\u2019s trailer, AND we\u2019ve just released a demo of our game on Steam!\n\nThe game takes place in a Montreal hotel in 1958, and you play as Sophie Roy, a maid who has a fascination with the lives people lead behind closed doors\u2026 leading her to snoop on the various guests at the hotel. Her snooping leads her to a larger mystery taking place, and she takes it upon herself (with the help of some friendly - or more-than-friendly - coworkers) to get to the bottom of it.\n\nThe game is heavily inspired by games like Life is Strange, L.A. Noire, and a dash of Nancy Drew, while the aesthetics were inspired by the films of Alfred Hitchcock. As Sophie, you\u2019ll be cleaning rooms, going through the guests\u2019 belongings, conferring with your sidekick of choice by making meaningful dialogue choices and deepening your relationship with them, collecting clues, and solving puzzles. Be careful where and what you clean, though - you don\u2019t want the wrong people to know where you\u2019ve been!\n\nThis game has been a labour of love for our studio for the past 4 years, and we\u2019re so excited to be nearing completion. It would mean a lot if you could check it out!\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9fUfh6rSf0\nSteam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243850/This_Bed_We_Made/",

The good news is that the game is actually in third-person which will hopefully be less disorienting. :)",

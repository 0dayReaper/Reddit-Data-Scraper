They just need to find a way to properly implement it into the game, rather than having it be a meaningless background element. It would be such a waste to give up on it.",

I wish they kept the gritty atmosphere and worked more on making the characters better rather than doing a 180 and making each one of them a comic relief or whatever they are.",

Probably won't see another one for atleast 2-3 more years, since alot of the original team disbanded.\n\nI won't even be surprised if they axe the IP. Dissapointing, I would totally take something like WD2 but with an actual good story and a different city like Tokyo or something. The gameplay of 2's was peak Watch Dogs imo.",

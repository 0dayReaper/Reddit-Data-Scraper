I see people wanting progression and for the game to let you actually drive a car for more than one race before booting you out and into something different. \n\nWanting real, proper progression isn\u2019t a bad thing. The forza games are far too liberal with rewards. The community has been complaining for a long time about wanting them to fix it.",

If they go back to something similar to that I think a lot of fans of the series would be thrilled. I don\u2019t remember all of the first four games as clearly, but I seem to recall that at least the first and second one had great career modes and progression that was similar to Gran Turismo while also setting itself apart.",

They just give you 10k credits and doesn't tell you what to do next while FM4 give you starter car and give you pointer what to do next and only highlight event that you can enter with your current car in garage. FM4 is single player achieve perfect balance of progression and reward. Game occasionally give you car  when you level up/complete event while you still need to grind to get top tier car.",

Why not show the career mode, which tracks they have in the game or race types. \n\nI've been waiting for a good racing game that has a proper career mode where you start with a regular-ish car, do low tier races to afford upgrades and then slowly get better cars and can participate in higher tiers of races and tournaments. Let me specialise in one type of racing or try and win it all, open wheel, GT, endurance, rally, etc. Have a world map where random races appear (like in Payday 2 heist select) plus a choice of turnaments where you have to play a series of races in a row.\n\nForza Motorsport 7 forced you though a bunch of bullshit races (like top gear limo races) and stuff that you might not care about (rallying, historic cars, etc) in order to advance in the series that you actually liked.",

The fanboys always said \"but its REALSITIC, it's how RACING WORKS!\" No thanks, let me buy a Civic and upgrade it race after race until I'm going against Ferraris. That is part of the fun of the Forza games for me - there are plenty of other racing games where I'm forced to drive exactly what the series tells me.\n\nMeanwhile for all the \"realism\" that homologation was supposed to bring, the tire physics were trash, there's no fuel or tire strategy, track temps were not modeled, the AI would flat out cheat during supposedly homologated races (you could watch a replay with the AI telemetry turned on and see their cars somehow have +25 - 50 HP when all the cars are supposed to be the same). Wet races were not actually wet - they were just wet graphics with puddles that acted as \"debuffs\" when you drove through them, and the AI was not effected by them.\n\nYou couldn't select the weather you wanted to race in (you just had to keep restarting a race until it gave you a sunny or a cloudy day), and only certain tracks could be changed to wet. The AI can barely tap your bumper and you'd go into a spin but heaven forbid you touched them because they acted as if they were 50 ton boulders where nothing you could do would budge them off the racing line.",

The PS+ requirement for multiplayer has severely impacted my enjoyment of this console generation.

And I know PS+ comes with a few other features as well, but tbh I never really cared about the \"\"free\"\" games and storing a few gigabytes of save data costs Sony virtually nothing.",

If that carries over to infinite it could be huge as no other big game currently does that (cod, apex, fortnite). Obviously it isn't monetized in MCC so this doesn't confirm anything.\n\nGears 5, another Microsoft flagship also allows people to unlock things from previous battle passes.\n\nEDIT: Also since a lot of people are talking about this. We don't know if the game is $60 for the campaign. Microsoft has not announced a price tag. Check the xbox/steam store page - you can't pre order the game.",

They want Infinite to be a platform of sorts, they\u2019re not even thinking about making another Halo game for a long time. There are rumors that Xbox Live good is going to be free. They just announced free Infinite multiplayer. \n\nSo if rumors are true, by buying a Series X you can play Halo Infinite multiplayer for free, without Xbox Live or buying the game. That\u2019s a big sell. Halo is already popular (maybe not as much as before), and this will open up the gates to so many new people (PC players too!).",

Let's not even talk about how we were sold a separate story then what was told it was going to be.\n\nMP was alright though, it felt good.\n\n\nIf the discover hope trailer for Infinte wasn't as good as it was I'd have no hope for this series going forward.",

Well, 3 as well isn't it.\n\nWell theres a massive one of those wedged into a canyon and you have to fly ships onto it and find the cores to make it self destruct. This is all free form and you can attack from any angle. In our group we had one spartan attack from each end whilst being covered by the... shit, plane vehicles? The others drove. We snuck in headshotting everyone in our way and managed to start the countdown.\n\nThe best part? The self destruct WILL kill you if you're still in there and the big scarab... Kraken? Is locked in place above an abyss. So the only way out is flight. Now, when the self destruct starts hangar bays open and you can jump in banshees to get away. But we took our sweet time getting out and decided we had to bail out of a window. Our mate piloting a... Plane one? Managed to co-ordinate with us and park up outside the window. Giving us time to jump on top of the plane and be whisked away to safety as the big Scarab exploded.\n\nSUCH a cool moment! I don't know why the same team made the final bit of gameplay walking up a hill and getting blown back every few seconds by a gust of wind. Probably the same team that made Halo 4's final encounter a bloody quick time event with the wrong button prompts...",

My TV was purchased specifically because 1080p was supported at 120Hz. It cost a little extra but was entirely worth it.\n\nIf 120fps@1080p is being supported by newer consoles it really increases their value to me. I honestly expected 60fps regardless of resolution being the cap and it was not that attractive to me, I don't think 4K looks all that much better than 1080p 99.9% of the time. But the difference between 60fps and 120fps is significant to me.",

Right now MS wants to be the platform with the lowest barrier to entry.

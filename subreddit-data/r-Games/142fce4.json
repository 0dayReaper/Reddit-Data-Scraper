And almost no one really cares about the story in any of these games, anyway.\n\nI play games primarily for the gameplay. If a story is thin to nonexistent, I do not care as long as the gameplay is good. And I'm pretty sure this is true for the majority of people who play games. Just look at how many big games, like Fortnite and Tears of the Kingdom, have next to no story at all.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I still appreciate a good story. The Last of Us Part 1 and 2 are two of my favorite games of all time. But not every game needs a story to be unforgettable. Sometimes, a story \u2014 good or not \u2014 can even get in the way of the gameplay.",

Your preference is the minority view, especially with Nintendo games. That's why Nintendo doesn't bother.\n\nRemember that online communities are a tiny bubble. Those Overwatch fandoms you're referring to are not at all representative of the vast majority of people who play that game. Blizzard could easily get away with not appeasing those fandoms at all. (My guess is they only bothered because they thought they were building up to an MMO, only to scrap that recently.)",

It can be a larger or smaller part but it's still a very important part\n\n\nAnd video games are the most interactive medium. The idea that it's wrong to \"add story\" is bizarre to me. There are stories that you can *only* tell in a video game. Even TLOU the game has a very different feel from TLOU the TV show where in the game you're in the trenches with Joel and Ellie and throwing in hours and hours trying to survive\n\n\nYou can also design from gameplay first and still translate these things meaningfully and use them to tell a story. TotK already kind of does this with zonai being an ancient civilization currently in the sky, allowing the islands to have a different aesthetic feel, a different kind of enemy with a different moveset, and you can make zonai devices visually distinct and meaningful by having them be these pieces of technology from an ancient civ.\n\n\nEdit: AND the story is about islands falling from the sky, which works together brilliantly with the rewind power to periodically give you elevators into the sky and change up BotW's Hyrule so it feels distinct!",

Its known for decades that the games developed inside Nintendo have its gameplay developed first and then the story comes after based on those gameplay ideas. That's how all of their games have been developed for decades be it with younger or older employees.\n\nThe exceptions to that are on games published by them, be it with subsidiaries like monolith or close companies like IS, with Xenoblade and Fire Emblem that have a bigger focus in stories, but also done by companies with a different focus and culture than nintendo own development division.\n\n&gt; seems to have almost the exact same story as BotW right down to the four locations you go to (at first?) in order to solve problems in order to reach Zelda and power up and fight Ganon(dorf).\n\nnot at all. It follows a similar pattern but its not the same story.",

I've gotten all of the geoglyphs and have done three of the dungeons and while there's a neat twist every now and then, much of it is falling flat for me aside from a couple high points. To me it feels very similar except (BIG SPOILER?) &gt;!Zelda is a dragon instead of being trapped in Hyrule Castle.!&lt; If that doesn't resolve as I expect it to in/after the final battle then it *could* be an interesting twist to me!\n\n\nAlso, doing gameplay first doesn't mean you slot the story in from previous entries like a puzzle piece. Nintendo aren't the only ones that make games like that, anyway. They just seem to have trouble doing both",

Even the concept of link not speaking in the Zelda games is tired. Look Miyamoto, Link speaking isn't going to distract from me being invested in the game, in fact it's the opposite. Princess Zelda having 1-sided monologues during what should be impactful scenes is just bad. How can you carry a good story when the main protagonist plays a major role in the game AND is also completely silent.... Not mute I might add...he is silent to us only. \n\n\nWhat Nintendo does great is gameplay. Story telling not so much.",

Nintendo has always had a holiday game release even when they basically gave up on the Wii U and were all hands on deck for the Switch's launch. Not to mention they actively pushed out games/DLC that could've been saved for the second half of the year such Metroid Prime Remastered, Fire Emblem Engage's DLC, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3's DLC. It's possible they don't have any heavy hitters left for the year but they absolutely have one or two more games for this holiday season. It could be anything from a new 3D Mario to more GameCube remasters.\n\nWhat's strange is that this is the first time in years that we don't know of any game (That has a release window) that is slated for the second half of the year this late into the year. There's a lot of speculation as to why such as new hardware releasing this holiday window or simply Nintendo transitioning into the next generation in general but we'll have to wait and see.",

In basically every early year traditional direct in the past they'd reveal a second half game then expand on it later in the year but this is the first year in a long time that wasn't the case. \n\n&gt;Maybe Nintendo found for lighter years twitter announcements work just fine.\n\nBy all merits it's a unique year because of how little they want to speak about their second half and I don't think it has to do with just wanting to do social media surprise announcements even though that could be the case.

Although I can see how they would've wanted to release Three Hopes first before announcing a new game out of fear that people would lose interest in returning to the Fodl\u00e1n after moving on. But if they held on to it for that long I don't see why they couldn't have released it until April or so for a longer marketing push and then release the DLC waves through the summer and fall to keep it in the spotlight.\n\n...Unless *[puts on tinfoil hat]* they have yet another Fire Emblem game in the pipeline that they wanted keep distant from Engage.

There's the \"Iron18\" mystery, which would make sense if said remake started development before Engage. For context, Three Houses is \"Iron17\" in the internal filenames, and Engage is Iron19. Three Hopes had an entirely different internal name. There's the fact that Sigurd got a suspicious amount of focus both before release and in the game itself, basically second only to Marth of all the returning characters, and said focus would be explained away by a remake of his game being in development, as a means of telling newer fans who he is so they can get hype when that remake is officially announced.",

Pikmin 2's objective ended up veering into having to rescue Louie, so the Hocotate Freight President flew in to help rescue and fill in as the second captain.\n\nIt feels safe to say that Louie will likely have some hand, minor or otherwise, in Pikmin 4. He's been an increasing pain in the ass for most Pikmin protagonists so far, so needing to be rescued from possibly any sort of hijinks he pulls isn't that bad of a guess.",

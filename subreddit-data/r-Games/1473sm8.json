Launch balloons and probes to explore the planet while harvesting resources from the atmosphere. Build up your colony and thrive in a simulation based on real science. Venus awaits.\n\n[View the trailer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBVKcTlQbi0)\n\n**Key Features** (planned for the full game -- the demo available now is of course more limited!)\n\n* Based upon real-life science \u2013 Gameplay draws upon real-life research that suggests a floating crewed station at altitudes from 50-61km is feasible.\n* In-Situ Resource Utilization \u2013 Gather materials from Venus\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 or even its surface \u2013 and process them in order to provide your colony with things from oxygen and water to plastic products.\n* Budget Resources Wisely \u2013 Buy new machines to harvest resources, or buy the resources themselves. Pursue research projects that require lots of resources but give significant rewards, or economize and stick with cheaper projects that yield less. And be especially careful with resources that have to be shipped from Earth \u2013 at great cost.\n* Randomized Research \u2013 The research projects available to you are randomized, and their feasibility, time, and cost may vary from one playthrough to another. You also won\u2019t always know the time or cost of these projects at their outset \u2013 you\u2019ll have to balance the risk involved versus the potential reward.\n* Disasters and Design Defects \u2013 Your colony may face serious accidents. Your equipment may break. But even worse, your colony\u2019s systems may have randomly-determined design defects that are unknown at the start of the game and whose effects may last. Each playthrough will bring different challenges.\n* Altitude Matters \u2013 Should you float higher to get more solar energy, or float lower to be able to carry more weight? It\u2019s up to you.\n* Space Logistics \u2013 You can order new equipment and goods from Earth, but these things can only be shipped during realistic transfer windows, and can take over a hundred Earth days to arrive. You\u2019ll need to plan your shipments carefully to avoid shortages.\n\nPlease feel free to leave feedback either on the [Steam discussion forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2196190/discussions/) for the game, or on the [Rara Avis Interactive Discord](https://discord.com/invite/acBzvCC4bZ).  I want to hear from you about how I can make the game better!\n\nPress kit available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/159eeih_9DLU0tuRFtvDQDntsCsIHSu1R?usp=sharing).\n\n[Wishlist now on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2196190/Sky_Base_Venus/)",

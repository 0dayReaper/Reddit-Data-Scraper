Those of us who cared about the story were already mentally checked out after BfA. And to be fair, the zone designs of Shadowlands are pretty cool overall, especially Revendreth.\n\nNew expansions always sell well because there's a *lot* of people who come back to try them out, even if they don't play much in-between or otherwise. Anecdotally I know many people on my list who quit playing for one reason or another tend to come back for a new expansion that has a feature they're interested in.\n\nSL debuted with a bunch of new character customization options that had been asked for for *ages*, and the *intention* of covenants was to be like a sub-class even if that worked out horribly but the issues weren't apparent to most til the system was around for months. The new leveling experience is always praised. Castle Nathria is also the generally accepted best raid out of the expansion, everybody liked Denathrius.\n\nPeople didn't really hate SL until 9.0 and its pain points got extended severely (7 months with no new content, the anima drought, TORGHAST weekly, 9.0 Maw which i contend is the worst thing they've ever put in the game) and 9.1 did absolutely nothing to address most of those pain points, while providing very bland new content in Korthia. I know I personally hung around until then and after only a couple days of Sanctum raiding I threw in the towel. It also gave another horribly dumb story moment for people to be enraged about, and then the scandals dropped only a few weeks later.\n\nAlso anecdotally, there was a myth in the WoW playerbase that the expansion after a bad one had to be good or decent - Mists is looked on favorably to Cataclysm (unless you hate pandaren), Legion favorably to Warlords, so surely Shadowlands had to be good after Battle for Azeroth! Ahahaha. Yeaaaah.",

Act 2 had no references whatsoever to what happened in Act 1, and the main NPCs in Act 1 were completely absent from Act 2. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Act 3 is the exact same, with no mention of what happened in Act 1 or 2. It\u2019s a consequence of having it be an open world game.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many acts there are, but I hope that the latter half of the game has a more linear story so that it avoids this disconnected feeling.",

They made a good game first and foremost. Plenty of people can jump in right now, play the campaign, have fun, and walk away satisfied. \n\nMost live service games don't offer that - they basically just want to tease you along for years. \n\nOf course the \"micro\" transactions are pretty egregious but they seem to be mostly avoidable if you just want to play the campaign and move on. I can accept the cash shop in that case personally, as it will fund the long term live service for people are into that sort of thing - though they are definitely overpriced",

I used to think the average gamer was me, my friends, and the people who discussed games on forums like gamefaqs and reddit and the like. \n\nNope. I'd guess over half the people that walked into my store have never even heard of gamefaqs, and I'd guess about a quarter of them either haven't heard of or just don't use reddit. At least. \n\nStuff that we would consider some of the biggest gaming controversies of the year, or of all time, simply does not register in the news machine that feeds the common gaming consumer. The average gamer cannot tell you, perhaps outside of nintendo, what company is making their favorite games. And even then I'd say once a month I had someone coming in asking if we had mario for the playstation or xbox. Not a parent confused about what to get their kid, someone who just wants to play mario and doesn't realize that's owned by the company that makes nintendo products. \n\nI completely agree with the rest of your comment, in any case.",

I can't speak for the launched version of the game, but from beta and news reports, the game is designed with solo players in mind.  For pvp, it is constrained to an area called \"The Killing Fields\" (or something like that anyway) and is 100% optional.\n\nD4 is significantly more ARPG than MMO unlike Lost Ark if you played that, which was more MMO than ARPG.",

Every now and then, I\u2019ll run into 1 other person out in the open world or out doing a random event. Towns can be pretty full, but not MMO levels of full. You\u2019ll probably see like 10-20 players running around the main town while you\u2019re there. One time, there was a huge world event on the map, and it looked like there were around 10 of us there.\n\nI think they did a good job with that aspect of the game. I absolutely didn\u2019t want a mini-MMO. And fortunately, that\u2019s not what we got. It\u2019s basically a single player game (if you want it to be) but every now and then you will team up with some random players for 1-2 minutes before going your separate ways.",

                    "comment": "&gt; Just how much of this game is MMO? \n\nSome side content feels like the kind of quests you'd find in an MMO but the main content is what you'd expect from an ARPG. The post game quests are very similar to Diablo 3's adventure mode, so aside from bumping into players in town I do not personally feel like D4 is any more MMO-y than D3. \n\n&gt; Like if I wanted to have a completely solo experience how much will I have to interact with other players?\n\nYou will never have to interact with another player save for bumping into them while exploring the overworld. Sometimes you'll come across them while doing world events but never in dungeons unless you roll with a friend. The full campaign is very solo friendly. So is much of the post game content so far in my experience. \n\nWorld bosses are another optional content that is not typically gonna be done solo. These bosses are huge health sponges and spawn in specific locations at very specific real-world times and you'll usually see a gaggle of a dozen or so players at these events.\n\n&gt;  I assume PvP is still optional right?\n\nCompletely 100% optional. There are specific parts of the world tucked away that are PvP zones and you never NEED to go there. If you ever played The Division it's kind of like the Dark Zones, you kill players and NPCs and get this currency you can extract to permanently keep, which you can basically use to buy some cosmetics or gamble for gear, but I believe you can get both of these other ways. \n\n&gt; I played an unhealthy amount of Diablo 2 back in the day, and some good amount of Diablo 3 thanks to Blizz giving it to WoW players for free.\n\nDid you like 3? 4 feels like a better, more refined version of 3 with the art direction of 2. I enjoyed 3 and I'm loving this game. I also didn't gel with Diablo 2 much but also only played it recently.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions, I played the game all weekend and am firmly in the end game.",

I expect to get a solid 100-200 hours out of it then return when there\u2019s more content.\n\nThe presentation is A++. \n\nThe open world adds to the game but they definately dont make the most of it. Since T1/T2 cap monster level at 50, the game effectively punishes you for doing all the side shit until are you beat the campaign. So even though theres this really cool world with some actually interesting quests to do, im still beelining the campaign. I'll go back and do em later but it totally ruins the organic nature of the open world for like no damn good reason.\n\nAlso, I dont like the current state of the builder/spender thing they got going on. Maybe some of the other classes are better but every time I have to left click i die inside. They need to shift some of the power from the core abilities and put it on my left click because every time I have to left click a basic insect like 10 times to kill it i wanna uninstall. This is probably my biggest complaint atm. \n\nLast up is build diversity and progression. I have mixed feelings. I like my abilities overall (builders not withstanding) but I think ive already kinda peaked on what they do. I don't really think theres any truly unique legendaries in the end game that drastically change how things play. Like my best legendary just makes my best ability hit twice. WoW, really shook things up there. Other than that everything I get is just bonus damage to stuff thats CCed and applying slow to generic status effects to take advantage of that effect. Its FINE but i'm level 40 and already kinda have everything i'm  gonna get which just feels a little lame. Also, I want more combos. Give me league of legends style combos, please. Bolder into right click feels great, I just wish there was more. ADD MORE INTERACTIONS FFS. Rogue was really good about this but barb and EVERY druid spec barely have any.\n\nAlso the class features are underwealming. I did a class quest, unlocked a few static bonuses im only gonna change if i respec and then forgot about it. Kinda lame and they hyped it up like there was gonna be more to it lol\n\nThat said, nightmare dungeons do look really cool and I think endgame will be a lot of fun. I just hope they make the most out of the seasons and battlepass stuff they got going on while adding some more variety to the classes with legendaries. Game absolutely has the potential to end up being a 10/10 if they support it properly post launch.",

                            "comment": "End game is significantly different from D3. The Paragon Board has quite a bit of depth and ability to customize your character. There is nothing even close to that depth in terms of theory crafting we can do. People might eventually find optimal paths, but even slightly different skills or a key unique might cause you to rethink your board.\n\nThe lack of item sets and ability to extract and imprint legendary aspects means I am constantly on the hunt for better rares, not just legendaries like Diablo 3. I think it makes the finding of loot and completion of ordinary content a lot more rewarding.\n\nThere is a variety of end game content from Nigjtmare Dungeons, Helltides, Tree of Whispers, and even the reputation grind early on. There is more than just endless Rifts, though Nightmare Dungeons are a decent equivalent. Even then, the Dungeons are modified by affixed that do have an impact on how the Dungeons unfold, especially on Torment difficulty. \n\nEvents like World Bosses I have enjoyed. Having a huge group of people working together towards that shared goal has been a lot of fun for more and D3 doesn't provide experiences like that.\n\nWay more item affixed that matter. In D3 you pretty well knew exactly what you wanted for where great slot for every class and usually even the exact piece of loot. Once again, there may be optimal builds in D4 but there is so much more diversity I think it opens the door to more possibilities on loot since getting those best rolls can be so difficult. \n\nAlso, the evade mechanic and potion system is even quite a bit different with the pacing of fights and overall difficultly. Combat on D4 feels slower overall than D3 (in the late game at least). \n\nSo overall, I think there is plenty that sets it apart for D3, but you might need to wait until end game to get all of it.",

Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the game - feels like launch D3 but without some of the major missteps and barely better endgame.  \n  \n- Scaling makes everything feel extremely samey. I never feel like I'm suddenly crushing it with a build coming online.  \n- The way they've handled resource generators just isn't fun - Most builds are some burst and then slapping enemies around with your pitiful resource generator for 5 seconds.  \n- Itemization sucks, specifically with legendaries. Almost every excellent legendary aspect is available in a dungeon so nearly every legendary that drops is just a slight stat upgrade  to one of those aspects.  \n- The open world is neat at first but a drag at the end of the game. I wish they hadn't spent so much time on these WoW-style quests that people will do once and immediately forget about. For me personally, they aren't fun.\n- Endgame is basically D3. Nightmare dungeons are greater rifts. Bounties/helltide/world bosses are okay but don't hold your attention. I can't believe they spent 6 years on making this game and didn't put a more interesting endgame system in. This is honestly my biggest gripe.\n- I've experienced so many major bugs! Teleporting into the ground, town portal not working, buttons just completely stop working, quests bugging out, mounts rubber banding.  \n  \nI think we're going to see plenty of praise in the first week or so of D4's launch and as people reach higher levels (and especially endgame) there's going to be a lot of disappointment.",

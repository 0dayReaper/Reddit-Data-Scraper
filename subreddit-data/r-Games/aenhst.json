Except everyone had a bad time because it turns out Microsoft took care of a lot of boring stuff for them. Pretty much everyone at the leadership of Bungie regretted parting ways with MS eventually.",

That's why it's silly that people remain so enamoured with some game companies when clearly the people and talent who made it special have all left and all it is now is a name brand. \n\n",

And just to be sure, I asked a personal friend of mine about some of the issues reported with their engine (just to make sure it wasn't pure BS) and...they are real, so to speak.  Destiny is built on an \"ancient\" engine (by today's standards) and it severely hampers their ability to be agile.  It takes \"forever\" to compile anything and once something is built, they will reuse it as much as possible because building new content is \"problematic.\"\n\nCoupled together with the fact that they refuse to go to a full server/client based architecture, further forces massive client side updates for even the tiniest change.\n\nNow, being separated from Activision WILL allow Bungie to grow their products and services how THEY see fit.  They won't be nearly as concerned with showing how they made an aggressive profit quarter over quarter.  They can take a breath, make decisions, and see how they play out.  It will help...probably.",

I'll see if I can find it. \n\n[Destiny 1's messy development](https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731)\n\nI can't find the article for D2, there may not have been one, but the author of the article for D1 said this in a Destiny podcast:\n\n&gt;I think that it (Destiny 2) was made in a relatively short period of time. There was a big reboot of Destiny 2 at some point of early 2016. There had been a previous director who was directing the game before Luke Smith (who's the current director) took over. So that guy was kind of put aside and Luke Smith took over. I believe that was in April of 2016 but I might be misremembering. Don't hold me to that exact line. So if you think about it that way then they didn't really have a ton of time. It had been a 16 months period between the reboot and when the game finally shipped\n\nHe also goes on to talk about how Eververse was created:\n\n&gt;What Bungie decided was we can't do this any more this is too hard for us to do (referring to releasing a DLC every few months) the tools that we're working with are really hard to deal with. it's hard for us to make this much content. it's just hard to make content in general. And they said we're going to do a smaller or drip feed of smaller stuff and we're going to put up the Eververse and make money that way, and\u00a0Activision said okay. it was a part of their renegotiated deal and they got to a point where they didn't have to be cranking up so much content",

For example, very buggy in-game cinematic scenes where stuff popped in slowly. And they literally had to cut the entire 3rd act of the game. They also said the online multiplayer was a shadow of what they intended it to be. \n\nThe online multiplayer was just so huge and amazing for the time that those warts were easy to ignore. ",

It's from 2012 but it applies probably even more so today since companies have gone even further in the direction of not paying dividends. \n\nThere's also the element of the fact that when people talk about the \"market,\" they typically only consider the S&amp;P500. The problem is that there is a massive survivorship bias there. Companies are going in and out of that index constantly, plus it's constantly weighted by market cap, meaning that it's guaranteed to outperform the market as a whole since the best-performing companies make up a greater portion at any given time. \n\nThat's just me ranting, but I highly recommend Research Affiliates just in general if you are interested in learning about the financial world and investing. The information they give away for free is unbelievable. I know quite a few people in the front offices of Hedge Funds that swear by RA. ",

It's increasingly clear that something has to change to protect people from the inevitable economic ups and downs caused by the seemingly never ending cycle of bust and boom. I get a lot of people hate the concept as they view it as some sort of socialist handout but what it's about is giving people the security to know that they aren't completely fucked when the next inevitable round of downsizing happens.\n\nBasic income is about putting some power back into the hands of people so they aren't completely beholden to corporations which by their very nature don't care about people. If we can afford it is debatable but the concept sounds like a pretty good idea to me.\n",

They have been heading this way a while when all their eggs have been put into a few baskets and they need to find a way to grow. Diablo is one of their Eggs that can easily be put on mobile and be extremely profitable, Destiny on the other hand is expensive and not very easy to grow from where it is. Destiny should be extremely profitable, but Activision needs it to be continually growing in profit in order to keep shareholders happy, but the only easy way to grow Destiny is to force in more micro-transactions.",

Their marketing and finance teams full of people with MBAs and no passion for games get their tentacles on a project and shape how it develops. Instead of passionate game designers making the games they want, the MBAs design a monetization scheme that the entire game has to revolve around. The result is a shallow slot machine/loot box generator that lacks depth and solid game mechanics. I'm really looking forward to seeing where Bungie can take Destiny now that they own it completely. \n\nThis really sheds a little more light on the black hole that Blizzard seems to be sinking into as well.

Dude is Bungie and they wouldn't be what they are without him, but he seems to be the root of a lot of their problems too. There are other's too but he seems to be the heart of it. Reach and ODST seemed to have gone pretty smoothly and he wasn't involved from what I recall.  \n\n\nI too work in tech. People really don't understand what is involved and how complex everything can be, especially when you get egos and such going.",

Despite the game being an absolute mediocrity, the amount of marketing made it too big to fail. It generated stories day after day on every website regardless of the games merit.

As production values got higher and higher, Bungie began to fall apart. Destiny's development was a complete shitshow where the entire game was scrapped and rebuilt six months from release. That is not something well run companies do. That is the domain of companies with no freaking idea what they're doing.

Hopefully being under Bungie's control allows Destiny to slowly shift into the original vision they had for the series.\n\nEdit: Iterated releases of the franchise were baked into the deal between the two companies. Could this allow Bungie to shift away from the Destiny, Destiny 2, Destiny 3, etc. model and make a single, living Destiny with continuous content updates more along the lines of a true MMO?",

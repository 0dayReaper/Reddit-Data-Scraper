That's what all I can tell now.*\" He doesn't directly mention Taylor, but the impression I'm getting is that he's calling her a liar which would be a pretty bold move.\n\n~~\n\n**Edit 2 from the future:** New evidence has since come out that seem to support Kamiya's side, Although things would have probably gone better for him if he had just stayed quiet until Platinum or Nintendo could provide an official statement. He's always had a reputation for being an ass, which certainly didn't help him out in this situation.",

The \"edgy, asshole auteur\" bit.\n\nWhich works fine when you're popular and it comes off as quirky, but doubling down on it when you're being raked over the coals for not paying your talent very well is kinda awful.\n\nAlso, one of his \"rules\" is that you don't speak English to him, which is a really stupid thing to remind people when your English-speaking talent is calling for you to be boycotted. Sorta sends the message of, \"English speakers don't get to criticize my decisions\" which sorta only reinforces just supporting the boycott.",

Employees rarely get outright fired save for extreme cases when they do something egregious at work or there's company-wide downscaling and firings. Usually, the employee that's on the blacklist gets reshuffled to a much lower-paid position within the company, a position that's clearly below their skill level, gets odd shifts, an overwhelming amount of work/ludicrous deadlines etc. etc.  Basically, they get forced into quitting instead of getting fired by the employer.",

Well, at least at one time they wouldn't have... this is the age of social media where you can't really hide much of anything anymore so they've lost respect over this.  You combine this with the joke that was Babylon's Fall and the studio isn't looking too good right now.\n\nIt doesn't make sense but a lot of what they're doing right now doesn't make sense.  Unless Taylor got real big for her britches and was holding them up for way more money than they thought she was worth, it doesn't make sense.  Hale to me would command more money than Taylor would, other than the X factor of Taylor being the established voice of the character and the continuity of which would put her closer or past Hale in value than she otherwise would be valued at and there's no real way you can measure something like that out in actual monetary value.  Taylor's what everybody wants... if she were happy to be paid less money than Hale then it makes no sense to piss everybody off and pay out more money to make a casting switch nobody was asking for in the first place.  It's not adding up to me... it feels like a piece of this story is missing.",

Well known and veteran voice actors can regularly command above scale, or even double or triple scale. Union scale works out to a little over 250/hr (structured  per 4 hour session). It is more than likely that money was not the only factor in this, as Jennifer\u2019s representation likely would not book her on the game for less than double scale. \n\nFor non union work, often the hourly rate is about the same as the union rate or more, there\u2019s just less paperwork and production doesn\u2019t have to pay into health &amp; welfare benefits (13% on top of the rate). \n\nFor perspective, I\u2019ve been paid just under $6k for 23 working hours of performance of a character in a game. $4k for the returning title character of a major franchise is a low ball offer no matter how you look at it.",

I would say you can usually cover about as much time in game as out of game, it\u2019s not quite 1:1 but for ease of discussion we\u2019ll say it\u2019s around an hour irl for an hour of gameplay. \n\nThe thing to take into account is that you can pretty much *only* book four hour sessions. Meaning if you need to record 30 more minutes of audio, you\u2019re paying for another four hours. You also have to record foley, which includes grunts, screams, breathing, \u201cI got hurt noises,\u201d etc. \n\nUsually for union there is a flat rate as a base, and then the bigger the project and role is, the more the money goes up. Knowing the new VA is union, assuming this was around 4 sessions, she definitely got more than $4k.\n\nVA\u2019s also almost never get residuals from games, and are (dare I say, obviously) considered easily expendable. Look at what happened when a single VA asked Crunchyrole to simply consider turning one of their biggest moneymaker shows ever into a union project. They fired the VA, effective immediately. Being a VA can be a blast, but I would wager they\u2019re one of the performers that the industry most takes advantage of (along with stunt workers, for very very different reasons). It\u2019s really a shame, VA\u2019s can make or break a project and studios really do walk all over them.",

Which is just hypocritical and makes people wonder why they even involve themselves with it. I will say Hellena Taylor is not like that at all, she has actually defended Bayonetta in the past when it was under criticism for the sexualization which makes it even more bizarre they wouldn't value her more.",

Since they couldn't just offer the original VA more money anymore, they figured the next best bet was to get an experienced VA, now realising the importance of paying voice actors.\n\n2. They wanted to get rid of her for some reason but didn't have a legitimate reason to fire her, so gave her an insultingly low offer so she'd leave.",

Maybe that figure assumes responsibility for a certain proportion of Smash Bros' sales since she was introduced as a character?\n\nI'm not disputing her side of the story about the payment offers and audition/negotiation process. But I'm curious whether others here think that $450m is a reasonable estimate for the kind of money floating around the Bayonetta franchise?",

Some publisher just dump the cash, others would have their people in house with the dev to develop the game.\n\nIn the case of bigger publishers, they usually have large team who works with IPs they're interested to invest in. In another word, the publisher literally have a team who's main purpose is to sit on the drawing board, bounce ideas and come up with what they think could be the best concept for a game.\n\nDevelopers might not have that type resource for such kind of structure/team, the smaller the developer the less chance they'll have department/team to bounce ideas and conceptualize those. These dev don't have the luxury of letting theirteam to kick back and relax (as in not fully working for that 45 hours/weekly they're being paid for). So, the developer usually have one person who comes up with the game ideas and just run with it which is why we end up with game like Babylon's Fall; a game which looks like it had the budget and manpower to be a great game but it was uninteresting in the end.\n\nWhen the publisher(s) I mentioned above decides to invest in a project, they already have concept and system documented plus they probably have one person or a small team who actively supervise the work. The developer have some freedom to do their things but they're generally tightly focusing on the design documents the publisher gave them. Which is why game backed by a publisher (specially the bigger ones) have more chance of being better games.",

Tetsuya Takahashi is simply not very good at the business side of project management, and things he worked on regularly went underdeveloped and over budget. In one of Satoru Iwata's blogs, he mentioned how the pitch for Xenoblade Chronicles was Takahashi bringing in a model of the Bionis and Mechonis clashing and explaining the story of people living on the bodies of titans, and then when asked about anything else relating to the game, Takahashi replied that the model and concept were all he had. No systems, no gameplay demo, nothing.\n\nNintendo's production management played a big role in making sure Xenoblade didn't experience the same issues Xenogears and Xenosaga had, and even then it still had to be delayed a few times. But the partnership worked out and now Monolith Soft is arguably Nintendo's strongest first party developer between the success of Xenoblade and their help on Breath of the Wild.\n\nA lot of Platinum's shortcomings feel like a result project mismanagement that *could* (but not necessarily would) be solved by another company taking over production management in a way that they can only do if they own Platinum. But that depends entirely on both the inner workings of Platinum and the prospective company that would purchase them.",

Remember that Bayo 2 was rejected by Sega and Sony and Microsoft and it wouldn't be a thing if Nintendo didn't decide to pick up the slack. That doesn't bode well for a game. And Bayo 2 being a Wii U exclusive until its remaster would be another kick in the balls.\n\n&gt;How important does corporate think voice actors are?\n\nobviously not important at all. That's kinda why VA's unionized to begin with.",

Sure he may be the English VA of Warcraft which went on to be one of the biggest selling games, but he assumed that him being the English voice of Arthas was enough for him to ask for a much bigger pay (than all his other VAs). \n\nArthas is dubbed in several languages, and so for the VA to ask for some sort of Hollywood standard of celebrity pay (several more than other VAs would have been paid) did not make sense. \n\nI know with Bayonetta, the English VA was the first and only voice for a while (even in the Japanese version) but just from her attitude and wording (and being replaced by a bigger name VA), it may have sounded like she was hard to work with. \n\nSome VAs like Tara Strong or Greg Cipes are possessive of their characters, and I remember them hating on the fact (and sort of dismissing the other VAs that played their characters in a different continuity) they were not in some DC animated Teen Titans movie (unrelated to the same Teen Titans cartoon series in continuity) despite the fact stuff like this happens a lot and they still retained their roles for their Teen Titans stuff.\n\n**For example** *\u201dI wish the new actress all the best luck in the World, but she's not the voice of Bayonetta. I created that voice. She has no right to sign merchandise as Bayonetta\u201d* \n\nWhat does she mean by \u201cmerchandise\u201d? \n\nNow, to me I do not know if she tried to pull her weight around like WC3\u2019s Arthas\u2019s VA (why he was replaced) or she was a victim of having been replaced by celebrity appeal but I kind of sort of lean on the potential attitude issue. \n\nShe asks for a boycott and dismisses her replacement VA. We do not know who did what wrong but like others said, Jennifer Hale did nothing wrong. Just from her statements, she seems kind of unprofessional and possessive about the issue which may mean she may have been unprofessional and possessive during the negotiating phase.",

Why did Helena throw Jennifer under the bus? Kamiya responding publically to this and implying that Platinum's side of the story will be told sopn makes me feel there's way more to this then we know. \n\nI'm not even angry or outraged over this.

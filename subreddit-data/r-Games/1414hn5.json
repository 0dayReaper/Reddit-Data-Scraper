It's simple to concentrate on attractive graphics, but in terms of enemy attack reactivity, fromsoft is far ahead of the majority of the competition. When I attack an enemy and get no response, it kills my excitement. This was a pretty bad place for the first lords of the fallen. Particularly with that second boss, where your hits had a 50/50 chance of doing damage",

Souls games have these jiggly parts that move when you hit big enemies, and even small enemie get usually stunned by my swings for a secod. God of War has the weapons stick in the enemy for a tiny fraction of the move and it's why that games combat feels so good (among other things of course)",

The game is pretty transparently, \"Dark Souls with guns,\" and they really got this part right. For example, you can pepper an enemy with handgun fire while closing on them to suppress their ranged attacks, blast a shotgun into a melee bruiser's forehead to stagger it so you can retreat, etcetera. It's even better in multiplayer, where one player can suppress an enemy while another charges it.",

It gets boring as hell fighting the same things all game long, and the original Lords of the Fallen definitely fell into that trap with its 10 or so enemy types.\n\nAnd yes, Elden Ring had repetitive enemy types in the long run due to reuse, but the actual amount of enemy types was really high and varied.",

Enemy variety is always sooo underestimated. \n\nFor reference, Elden Ring has 70 unique bosses, and 238 boss fights. \n\nIt also has 146 different enemy types (not counting variations of the same enemy). \n\nFor reference:\n\nBreath of the Wild had 16.\nHorizon Forbidden West had 40-50.\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla had 25-30.\nGhost of Tsushima had around 10.\n\nOther Souls Games: \n\nDS1 ~67\nDS2 ~69\nDS3 ~70\nBB ~61\nSekiro ~50-60\n\nHere the full list and source:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/tk4vk2/on_elden_rings_enemy_variety_and_how_it_compares/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_term=1\n\nMy take is that the staggering amount of enemies of Elden Ring is the result of a *good kind of iteration*. \n\nThey built a huge library of animations and styles, both for enemies and the players that they can reuse, mix, swap, tweak, build upon. This allows them to have huge variety of weapons, enemies, bosses, and focus development on other important things, and free up resources to work on what\u2019s new. \n\nthe scale and scope of Elden Ring simply wouldn\u2019t be possible without their previous work. \n\nThey iterate on their solid foundation in a very smart way, focusing on different things every time and slowly developing more and more layers to their gameplay.\n\nCompare the design of Demon\u2019s Souls and Elden Ring. Same foundation, maaaany more layers. \n\nI\u2019d say that their greatest asset is *good iteration* (:",

The marketing people crunched the numbers and decided that the *True Crime* label was likely to be more of a hindrance than a help. I still hear *Sleeping Dogs* brought up as one of the most original GTA clones, but no one seems to remember the *True Crime* games in any context.",

And thank God, because I'm about ready to start a new run in Demon's Souls Remake instead of trying to get to the Tower Knight again past two Black Phantoms.\n\nFromSoft has remained doggedly loyal to their weird co-op system. The ability to summon help is great, but I don't think anyone likes the retool with Invaders for Elden Ring. Player Invaders can only enter a world when co-op is already happening, which makes the game actively disincentivize hanging out in co-op with a friend or two while also meaning playing as an Invader is 2v1 by default. I haven't seen any other Soulslikes do this. Most dropped the Invader premise entirely, and some (like Remnant: from the Ashes) add standard lobby-based co-op as a default feature.\n\nOne element of From's design that I think is way underappreciated is combining money and XP into a single currency. Most RPGs eventually reach a point where money is no longer a tension point. Rather than making upgrade costs scaling logarithmically, I like From's approach more. Anything you buy could instead have been spent on character improvement, meaning money never feels like it's effectively infinite.",

Duels are okay but invasions are such a unique mechanic. \n \nI just wish they did more to curb overpowered players on both sides. New players in Elden Ring being stomped by invaders with broken weapons sucks, and invaders being faced with overleveled phantoms they can barely tickle also sucks.

It feels like everything is just a little too slow. But what I appreciated is the bigger presence that narrative took. It made the game feel desperate, but determined; not hopeful per se, but it had a mood of gritting your teeth to avert oblivion, rather than Dark Souls' themes of futility and giving in to despair.\n\nIf LotF2 has a decent story about paying bitter costs to survive something that no one should be able to endure, I think it can carve itself a space in the Soulslike genre that currently feels a bit underwhelming.\n\nEDIT: There's a throwaway line in God of War Ragnarok that feels like the perfect blueprint for the protagonist of a Soulslike: \"Death can have me when it earns me.\" Would love to see this game go for that tone.",

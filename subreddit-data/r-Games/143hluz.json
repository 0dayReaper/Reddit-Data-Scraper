            "comment": "Alright finally a thread I can help with. I have the WR speedrun for the longest race in Baja: Edge of Control.\n\nSo basically Baja: Edge of Control is an offroad racing game where you use different sorts of standard vehicles ranging from trophy trucks to Jeeps to Volkswagen Bugs. You can do short lapped races around tracks with big jumps and bumpy roads but the highlight is definitely the longer endurance races that include multiple stages and never repeat over the same section of track. The one I hold the record for took over two hours to complete in one sitting. The only other mechanic worth mentioning is repairing your car mid race. Your parts like shocks and wheels will wear down as you race so from time to time you will have to pull over next to the repair helicopter and dedicate a few seconds to repairs, so timing your repairs is essential for running a race efficiently (if you have repairs turned on in the settings).\n\nIn all honesty the game doesn't really sound that exciting on paper, nor does it really exceed expectations outside of a few select notions. But, despite sounding rather bland, I absolutely love the handling model and physics the game has and never find myself getting bored while racing, hence making this one of the two games I've ever bothered to speedrun. If you bother to put the game physics on advanced/realistic, it almost feels like your trying to ride a bull with the throttle pinned while going over bump parts of the road. You'll have to really get used to knowing when to pin the gas when going around turns or risk flying off the track and totalling your ride. I've played technically challenging racing games like BallisticNG and Gran Turismo, but nothing has ever given me the same emphasis on taming the controls of a vehicle as Baja.\n\nNow, where's the major issue with this revival of the game series? Well the developers Rainbow Studios, which are mostly famous for the MX vs ATV series and the ATV Offroad series, has had a terrible track record with their latest entries to MX vs ATV. Each entry consistently launches without finished content and totally messed up physics and handling (the two most important parts for the fans of these sorts of games). And despite the fans constantly insisting that they should go back to the old physics in games like MX vs ATV Reflex back from 2009, the studio continues to take their franchises in the complete opposite direction that their fanbase wants. \n\nI for one have abandoned all hope on Rainbow fixing their mindset and making the MX vs ATV series as good as it used to, so my expectations for a new Baja are near the same place. I will say that having only one entry into the franchise could imply that there is a greater chance they can do something good with it, but comparing their other work doesn't do much good for that idea.",

Honestly I feel so goofy listening to myself and really want to get another record with a better microphone so it's a less painful experience lol. Plus, I never really do anything like it so I was pretty nervous and a lot of it is just random rambling LOL.\n\nI don't think my record is that good regardless, somebody could easily come along and beat it if they tried. VERY unoptimized. In fact, when I ran it for the record it was my first time playing the game in AGES.",

The campaign is a real slog by the halfway point so just getting whatever vehicle you want and perfecting your racing skills is the key to having the most fun. I also highly recommend putting the physics on the advanced setting because it makes the handling a lot more fun once you get used to it.",

That game nailed it, felt great to play with an xbox controller but was still \"simulator\" enough to never get boring and feel the same. The stages looked bland but I loved how they could take a while to complete. \n\nI have zero faith in that new game tho, exactly for that reason I mentioned: they need to deliver fun physics. And it seems like that developer is incapable of that (at least in their previous games).",

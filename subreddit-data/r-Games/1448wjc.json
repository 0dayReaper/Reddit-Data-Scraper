It's really excellent.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't take too many games before the AI's passivity becomes a real issue for replayability. They're working on it but it needs some love!",

Magic victory is trivial, and unifying victory isn't much harder either due to how passive the AI is. All you can do is bash yourself against the AI, since it doesn't pose much threat.\n\nPart of it is also due to some vassal bug, and at least this one is confirmed to be patched when the DLC drops.",

It feels like I either play with settings where units are obsolete very quickly, or it take 40 turns to build a simple worker. I also wasn't a fan of the district management. It was just too much to keep track of for me.   \n\n\nI love Warhammer fantasy, so the setting of this game is immediately appealing to me but I just don't know if it would be too similar to Civ.",

Plus unit and building production are two different things for the city. Also a tier one unit can still be usefull later. Where in civ 6 a 2 Era old unit is horseshit.\n\nThis has a bit of the adjacency thing that civ 6 has but you can change what upgrade you made on a province. (Provinces are similar to tiles in civ 6). Even then the adjacency is a lot simpler then civ 6 where it's like forest and other districts give .5 nut a mountain is 1 and a natural wonder is 2,etc. It is usually 1 maybe 2 types of province upgrades like 5 types of province upgrades. \n\nI personally stopped playing civ 6 cause of the adjacency bonus stuff leading to me trying to plan a whole city on turn 6, but this has none of that.",

Later you research... \"frost arrow enchantment.\" Cast the Frost Arrow enchantment, and then all of your existing, current, and future archers will have frost arrows. Same with any other enchantment you research.  \n\n  \n\nAn early game archer vs a lategame archer -- it doesnt have to be a whole different unit, the things you research will improve your archers.",

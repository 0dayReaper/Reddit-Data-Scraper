    "postText": "I know, to look at the game in its current state objectively is a tough ask given the abysmal launch. I'm biased just like everyone else is. I put about 100 hours into the game at launch and dropped it a month after release after I realized how unsatisfying the core gameplay loop was. I jumped back in right at the beginning of Season 4 three months back and have had a much better experience, although I still have several issues with the core design of the game.\n\n\nSo I'm going to organize this post into the areas where the game has improved the most, while still emphasizing the flaws in the same areas where the game has work to do.\n\n\n1. Map Design - the maps were the biggest problem with the game at launch imo, along with a million other issues obviously. Flat wastelands with no cover except for the odd mile high sniper/wingsuit tower. There's just no overstating how bad these maps were. The last of the reworked launch maps will be released in this season and they're one of the leading reasons the game is playable again. They're still not great maps, but they work for this game. It also helps that there's been more of an emphasis on 64 player variants on the newest maps and reworks. The Zavod remake added to the game today is 64 players only and it feels so much more predictable as a result. The core design of the maps is still the same, but the distance between objectives has shrunk considerably and cover has been added to every point of interest. So expect to see even more shipping crates and sandbag fortifications then there already were.\n\n\n2. Class System and Teamwork - This one is both night and day from launch while also still showing the scars of a system that was botched from the beginning. On the positive side, medics are everywhere again and I'm finally getting revived as much as past Battlefield titles. And they can't choose to rock a rocket launcher instead of a medcrate anymore! What a terrible idea that one was to start with. Engineers are actually encouraged to stick near vehicles since they always have a repair tool now. We have a dedicated anti-air role in Liz and a dedicated tanker role in Crawford. As a Rao main, my biggest issue on launch was that I wasn't being rewarded for disabling an enemy vehicle even though that's a huge help to my team. Now I actually get an assist if the vehicle is destroyed while it's disabled. On the negative side, there's still no class restricted weapons so you can never be sure that the recon you spotted actually has a sniper. This is helped a bit by proficiencies that encourage classes to use their typecast guns but the bonuses aren't that great so lots of people ignore it entirely. You're also rewarded *wayyy* more on the scoreboard for playing a spotting/recon role then you are for playing an anti-vehicle role. Destroying vehicles in general should reward way more points.\n\n\n3. Gamefeel and gun mechanics - There's no getting around just how horrible this game felt to play on launch. You're aim would jitter all over the place, aim assist was completely broken, and your soldier felt like they were skating on ice instead of actually running on solid ground. That's not even to mention how bad performance was. With today's update, all of the aforementioned things aside from performance has come more inline with past BF titles. The performance still is pretty meh but I'm at least getting significantly better frames then I was on launch. The other big issue the game had was very easy to learn gunplay. Guns were laser accurate and recoil patterns were pretty consistent across all weapons. It felt very dumbed down from the more weighty feeling of BFV and that's still largely the case. The one big improvement in this area is that you can no longer hold down LMB on assault rifles and beam enemies from across the map. You're accuracy now goes down the longer you fire so you're encouraged to burst in a manner similar to BF4. I still would prefer more recoil instead but it is what it is I guess.\n\n\n4. Overall Sandbox Play - This is the real make or break point for me. A Battlefield game can be horribly unbalanced and laggy, but if it nails the sandbox play then I'm going to have fun regardless. And I think the sandbox is in a really good state right now in 2042. You've got crazy futuristic rail gun tanks that can snipe helicopters from across the map but also  have horrible angles to attack from. Condors can act as massive flying spawn points but no longer have the firepower to dominate a match like they did before this update. The TGM rocket can one shot most air vehicles but takes an insane amount of skill to use. If you can get a squad together with a Rao, an engineer with a stinger, and a support with an ammo crate, you can lock down an entire sector of the map from air vehicles. Right now it really feels like every strategy has a counter. On the flipside, as good as the overall sandbox balance feels right now, the gun balance is completely out of whack. The RM-68 has been extremely OP for a whole season with no signs of stopping and for some reason snipers now have to deal with scope glint even on 4x scopes which just seems cruel in a game where sniping is already so difficult. But it also seems like every BF game has these sort of balance issues that never get fixed so I'm not going to dwell on this point.\n\nLastly, as a final positive point, DICE just announced that there's more seasons coming after Season 5 when many people thought this was the end of the road and that the game was going to be abandoned here. For how much longer will it be supported? Who knows? At least six months.",

Now it's a traditional two column listing of 32 players, with your own stats as a 3rd smaller column. That would've been the ones they had by the time they put it up on the subscription services (because they put it up when they considered it fixed enough to try to reintroduce to the wider player base).",

Definitely worth a shot if you played it back at launch and didn't like it then, or haven't touched it because of the bad start it had.",

That being said, I really just hope they get the basic core BF shit RIGHT from the get go next time. Classes, all chat, a normal scoreboard, actual squad management and ability to easily switch squads and teams, generic soldiers instead of these super soldier motherfuckers etc. Battlefield has its niche, the fanbase always expects certain things, I don't know why they would stray from that. \n\nAlso they need to work on destruction again, the destruction is absolutely awful in this one and a joke. \n\nBut despite all of this, the game is pretty solid now, however I still wish that they just kept adding content into Battlefield 5 instead because I thought that game was great all around aside from the lack of post-release content",

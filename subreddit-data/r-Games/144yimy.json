Graphically, it feels like the monsters clash with how the environment looks. It looks like playing through a UE4 editor. Still they have half a year until they hit early access. Maybe the artstyle would fit much better by then?\n\nOn Steam, it screams Minecraft + Pixelmon/Cobblemon. I'm speculating this is where the devs took inspiration from.",

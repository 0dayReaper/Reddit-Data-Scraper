This resulted in same spaces stations, same creatures, same tree sizes, same planets, same color palettes. Even when there is some variety, they consistently employ the same specific combination. The corona stone thing always appears on barren planets and is absent from others. Mods are trying to address this by introducing additional assets (e.g. 10,000 sky color variations instead of only 100), and giving a chance for wilder planet generations; say, Earth-like planets with volcanic biomes and floating bubbles, or gigantic forests in snowy regions.\n\nSecondly, they added a ton of stuff, but never make all those things interact with each other. Those giant sandworms they introduced a while ago? The NPCs just stand there like statues when those massive creatures spawn right on top of their heads. The different factions? Lore says some of them are supposed to hate each other, but they're just hanging out not doing much at all. You can earn some faction points by doing them favors, but it's useless, only a way to get more stuff to buy. They've built this vast universe with tons of stuff, but nothing ever really comes to life. It's a dead universe.\n\nFixing the latter might be tougher, but mods have already sorted the first issue. It's definitely doable for Hello Games to do something about it.",

Part of me thinks that some of these games arent being deisgned to be fun, theyre designed to be engaging, and thus the design philosophy is off, just enough that it hits like an uncanny valley. Ive played multiple games where Im like \"this does everything I want, so why is it not fun?\"\n\nFor NMS in particular, I think an element of it is that the procedural generation makes everything feel 'cheap'. Not in the sense the the assets feel cheaply made, but that the game is so big, and randomized, that you paradoxically have no reason to soak up the sites. You begin to see the patterns, and the mystique dies, or you realize that your actions have little influence over the rewards you get. When all the ships you can buy are randomized, it feels.... less special, because its not like you did something special for this ship, you just had a fat enough wallet and someone parked it next to you.\n\nI also think that a lot of the sandbox runs counter to the theme of the game. Why establish a base and colony when the game is pulling for you to hop hop hop and only spend like 20 minutes per planet?\n\nAdd in the inventory/capacity stuff (which I know theyve fixed a lot), and it begins to feel like a chore because youre not exploring to explore, youre exploring to activate the next mission.\n\nIt also doesnt help that a lot of the missions feel kinda busywork and tutorials, though I also understand that I dont know how youd make them better and still fit in NMS.\n\nEvery so often, I boot up the game, and then face a chore list. What I dont understand is why I feel that way about NMS, but then can play Power Washing Simulator all night, which is literally a game about a chore lol.\n\nThats why I think there has to be something in the philosophy of game design that keeps churning out games that I should be overjoyed to play, and yet I cant stay focused on them.\n\n  \n\n\nOr I could be getting old.",

I feel like I have a bunch of developer tools when playing this game; I can summon any ship I own, I click a button and my whole fleet just shows up, I can teleport myself and all my ships with me across the universe\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the base building, like you said. The point of this game is exploration, why does every space station look exactly the same?",

In Terraria, youre always running over familar land that youve shaped and carved, it tells a story. With Starbound, planets just feel like resource dumps. You dont go to a new planet to explore a waterworld, you go because it has some metal you need for progression.\n\nI think that why Minecraft clicks for me too, at least the way I play it; I build up a home and explore from it to bring stuff back. I dont just keep moving biome to biome, I bring it back to add to my base.",

                            "comment": "&gt; For NMS in particular, I think an element of it is that the procedural generation makes everything feel 'cheap'. Not in the sense the assets feel cheaply made, but that the game is so big, and randomized, that you paradoxically have no reason to soak up the sights. You begin to see the patterns, and the mystique dies, or you realize that your actions have little influence over the rewards you get. When all the ships you can buy are randomized, it feels.... less special, because it's not like you did something special for this ship, you just had a fat enough wallet and someone parked it next to you.\n\nI think it's because we ultimately feel we're not dealing with a man-made thing. \n\nGaming can sometimes feel like a religious practice. You engage with the game, practicing full faith in a designer and operating under the belief that things are made for a purpose, that things will 'work out'. You find yourself checking behind waterfalls, trying left-hand paths, striking walls, jumping off of signposted ledges, going towards beacons of light, hitting coloured things -- all hoping that you'll be rewarded for your faith in that design with secrets and rewards. \n\nWhen things are procedurally generated, who knows? You feel like most of the time you'll find nothing or, worse, something you found elsewhere, easier.",

For Fallout 4, compared to 3 and New Vegas, loot felt like garbage. There was only a handful of 'unique' weapons and armor, most of which didnt even have unique skins, and most of them had the same 'perks' that randomly generated weapons had. Wanted the neverending double barrel shotgun? The explosive assault rifle? Better hope the RNG gods smile on you. 3 and New Vegas, on the other hand, made you want to crawl through every dungeon because so many had something that you wouldnt find anywhere else. I remember as a kid I had hundreds of pages printed out of Morrowind \"secrets\": where you could find certain high level gear early in the game, where you could find some magic artifacts, the mudcrab merchant lol.\n\nYou also kind of hit my issue with many roguelikes too, great insight. They arent bad games, but there frequently doesnt feel like there is any reason to want to explore.",

You always felt like you eked out more of the story from the game and could hit new dialogue. Story is a great reward! \n\nAt least FO4 could still give you story stuff. Skyrim, too. I remember first playing Skyrim and being enthralled with everything new. The first dragon priest I met and what an 'oh fuck' moment it was for me, doubled when it dropped its mask as loot.

For example, the game is supposed to be about exploration and traveling to the center of the galaxy, yet the base building is stationary and centered around planets. It's like if Raft had base building on islands instead of the raft itself. \n\nImagine No Man's Sky if all the building and customization was to your spaceship. You gradually cobble together your ship as it slowly grows into a colossal space station inching its way towards the center of the galaxy. You unlock new technologies as the resources become more exotic and the dangers more present. You have to tactically choose which planets to stop at and which to avoid, scanning for threats and resources as you constantly weigh them against each other. At any point you could run out of fuel or come across an enemy you can't best, so you have to plan your course carefully and build your ship and crew strategically. Each new anomaly is a risk you may not be able to afford taking, or even worse, a risk you may not be able to afford not taking.\n\nNo Man's Sky is adding all these really cool features but the game itself is lacking. It's more of a sandbox than a game imo.\n\nThat said, while I've tried to keep up with the game on the off chance it ends up doing something for me, I've never actually played it, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.",

That was the BIGGEST reason I got the game. I was so excited to get going and make this long trek to the center and discover this big mystery. The whole grind served this purpose and feeling it get easier and easier as I went along to reach the center made everything so much more fun.\n\nThen I got there and it was just a reset button. I hadn't actually reached anything. It just sent me back to start over in a new game plus state. It felt so hostile, so toxic. Everything I had done felt so meaningless. There never was anything to chase.\n\nI don't hate the game or the devs, far from it. I just wish I had some extrinsic reasons to explore multiple galaxies.\n\nAnd it's unfortunate because the one sort of extrinsic type thing they have going for the game is the expeditions; but those are locked behind a tragic FOMO model that instantly makes me not even want to bother with.\n\nI know this game will never be compatible with me, but it's painful because it's always, constantly, teetering on the edge of becoming what I want.",

I'm playing Tears of the Kingdom right now and there are so many moments where I can tell things were placed intentionally or just slightly visible from where the game expects you to be looking. When those moments happen I know something meaningful will be at the destination. A randomly generated world can't achieve this, I can never be sure I'm going somewhere interesting and that kills the motivation. No Man's Sky has size and volume going for it, but handcrafted open worlds are so huge now that exploration lasts 100s of hours and that's really all I need.",

Those games still have handcrafted elements that are placed in specific locations and designed around. I'm a fan of NMS for the most part, but knowing that every planet is going to be randomly generated from a set amount of parts and no guarantee of any interesting or meaningful aspects can really drag down the experience. I liken it to the real world, I can walk around and see some beautiful sites in a landscape that was generated without/with minor human involvement, but if I stumble across some ruins, I am going to think \"What are those? Who put those there and why?\". I may come up with my own theories and they may be wrong, but it feels like there was purpose for someone. I feel the same way about the other studios that you mentioned's games, where even if I'm wrong, I like knowing there's a possible reason something is somewhere. If I see a ruin or outpost on a planet, it immediately feels more like \"the system randomly put it here\" than \"maybe there's a reason for this location, maybe there's a hidden story that will emerge\"",

What they need to do, what they needed to do first is remaking and improving the procgen of faunas, floras and planets. As long as everything you get is bland and there is no awe, there will be no joy",

You have to give players the idea that there's a lot of blandness, but that within that pool there's things worth seeing and spending time for, so players are forced to peel through layers and experience both the bland and the exciting.\n\nNoctis, which is almost exclusively visual exploration only, \"solves\" this by having 90% of planets look extremely bland with a handful of exciting mountain ranges, and making the entire purpose of the game the sharing of and theorizing about discoveries. But it also got away with it being rendered in 320x200, there not being any competition, people's imagination filling in the blanks, and - frankly - it appealing only to a very small niche. Not being a paid product also helps.\n\nEDIT: As part of my efforts to mod Noctis IV, I've theorized for more than a decade on how to make visual exploration interesting in a modern age, but I haven't found any solution that I'm really convinced about. Outer Wilds reinforces to me that exploration is interesting through story and narrative and the resulting gameplay, not the visuals. I've been thinking about Orienteering as a sport, and that it may be an interesting path to create pure exploration experiences, though I haven't explored (heh) this idea with any prototypes, nor have I seen anyone else attempt it....\n\nEDIT 2: building a trail (i.e. for hiking or space travelling) and trailblazing may be another thing to make pure exploration interesting. We did actually see people do this in Noctis; some explorers mapped out trails of stars to the edge of the Galaxy, which could be used to refuel at, thereby enabling others to explore areas never seen by anyone else. But these kinds of activities require there to be hurdles (physical) preventing exploration; the easier it is to travel around, the less useful these trails become.",

As soon as you get your Freighter flagship (your first is always free after completing an unmissable side quest) there's a % chance it'll come with a wayward frigate.\n\nAfter that you can purchase a random handful any time a neutral AI fleet warps in. Quality **DOES NOT MATTER** as they all generate the same amount of cash &amp; resources as well you typically want to get the lower quality ones because they're cheaper and you can always level them up through Fleet Expeditions. Generally speaking a cheap frigate goes for a couple hundred thousand credits to a couple cool million, expensive but they payout potential for them is insane. So how many hours? I dunno, 6-8 maybe? Depends on how much you're willing to play markets.\n\nQuality does effect the success rate of an expedition however. So sending a bunch of C-Students Frigates on a high tier mission will result in catastrophic failure and chance of scuttling the expedition to outright losing frigates. Expeditions happen in real time (though you can be a lil turd and mess with your computer's clock). Expeditions can be as short as an hour to a full friggin day. Fleet Expeditions have potential to pay out the nose in several million credits and also including several very rare commodities depending on the expedition type.\n\nAnd finally Frigate classes determine the passive things they harvest (which they do even when you're not playing. Combat Frigates and Exploration do not harvest (they do other more active things), Industrial Frigates harvest 100 Magnetized Ferrite every 30 minutes, Support Frigates 100 Condensed Carbon every 30, and Trade Frigates harvest 125,000 in cash every hour, yes that's right they can basically pay for themselves. You can have up to 30 frigates.",

The ship automatically hoovers them up and I had stacks in a short while.\n\nAnd gas extractors are pretty easy to build iirc. And if you're online you can visit other player bases that have extractors and loot theirs.\n\nBuilding farms for materials gives you something to do and a reason to have multiple bases. Something that was missing early on.\n\nAs for refueling? I ended up just using raw materials for that. Carbon, sodium, and oxygen cover most things. Ships can get a launch fuel recharger which helps immensely.\n\nCasually playing I usually just needed to make sure I had some warp fuel on my ship. Everything else I had literal stacks to the point I had *too much* and had to destroy stacks.",

Everywhere you go, there is narrative built into the landscape that engages my inquisitive mind.\n\nNMS\u2019s procedural worlds system is the antithesis of environmental Narrative. Just a bunch of sliders and algorithms mixing and matching environmental components. There are some attempts to have instances of environmental story telling in the game, but they loose all of their impact because they are still mixed into that procedural system. \n\n\nAll in all, I recommend it to people who like Minecraft.

Their cash flow is almost 100% driven by game sales (page 10 here) and page 23 has a breakdown of external investors, which is not many. Besides Sean Murray a 3% stake was sold in 2014 and in 2015 some additional shares were granted to 5 employees.\n\nhttps://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/06663645/filing-history/MzM2MDQzMDI0OWFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0\n\n\nI think the major reason they do these is just that there's a significant subset of players that like Expeditions, and they're relatively easy/safe things to work on compared to larger overhaul style changes it also allows them to experiment with new game mechanics without needing to support them indefinitely.  Another issue many long term players have is that the game is not goal oriented enough.  It's easy to just hit the point where the game doesn't present you any new challenges anymore, and you can buy anything you want, so you need to set your own goals instead.  Expeditions provide a very directed goal-based style of play, which you just won't get out of the main mode.\n\n\nExpeditions basically came around, because many players were starting fresh saves whenever a new patch landed.  Expeditions allow them to give players who play that way an intro to the new update mechanics, as well as a jump start that gives you tons of free resources to quickly get up to speed.",

I think everyone starts a new game save for the Expedition and all start in a similar place in the universe and they all play to reach certain milestones in the same area(so i guess you'll likely see people). Each milestone reached gives them an item/ship/object only obtainable from that Expedition\n\nSomething like that anyway. They're not updates but they normally have some new things or fixes in them.\n\nThey were added in a expeditions update a couple years back. New one starts every few months.",

Also explains why they didn't use their cookie cutter trailer formula. \n\nBut yeah expeditions are basically long story quests/missions, everyone starts in the same system for them in a brand new save and they provide some progression rewards to keep going with completing missions / milestones. They are fun as a self contained thing but it barely affects your main save, beyond the freebies you unlock from milestones.",

You start a new save in a set system with everyone else and there's like themed missions and story stuff. Usually there's like community goals and stuff too I think? And then after the expedition's over the save converts into a normal save so you can keep playing.\n\nThere's like new cosmetic content and small improvements/bug fixes but not usually new features I think. It's been a few years since I've played tho. [Here's the notes](https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/06/expedition-ten-singularity/?cli_action=1686157278.727)",

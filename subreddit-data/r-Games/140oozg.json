            "comment": "Would it kill them to add some interesting content one of these years. They've fiddled with the world generation and changed/added new biomes, but without any real reason to bother finding them. They add new mobs that don't really do anything. The most notable update in a decade was the nether one from a few years ago. The deep dark stuff they added sounded neat but ultimately became just another biome with no real reason to engage with it.\n\nCan we maybe get dungeons with actual loot? With new tools to play around with? Maybe new weapons? Maybe they could stop neglecting the whole mining portion of the game and change that up? Y'know, beyond adding random ores that don't actually *do* anything or changing up how caves are generated for the 50th time.\n\nMinecraft's fun, but it's also incredibly stagnant because their updates take so long just to add a useless mob or two, and a couple cosmetic blocks.",

What nonsense is that?\n\n&gt; Combined slabs. If you're thinking \"putting two different kinds of slabs together\" would be great, it is! **It just isn't going to happen.** (6 September 2018)\n\n???\n\n&gt; No realistic sharks. **Hostile mobs need to be fantasy creatures**. (2018, but since folks ask so much it's at the top)\n\nSo Silverfish don't count, I guess? Is their interpretation of them enough to warrant classifying them as \"fantasy\" creatures?\n\n---\n\nThey seem fundamentally opposed to adding depth to the experience - only breadth, which unfortunately leaves it a shallower experience than it could be.\n\nI know some people will disagree with that opinion, because Minecraft started as a strictly sandbox experience. I just think it can be more.",

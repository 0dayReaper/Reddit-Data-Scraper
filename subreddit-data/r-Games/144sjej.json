Never mind the number of kids being groomed at drag shows is 0 and at churches and schools it's uncountable. All you need to do is convince idiots like the COD player with a large impressionable following.",

And that for LGBT people to stop being attacked they need to stop grooming children. The problem being the the entire premise of the above is a lie and it's being used as an excuse by right wingers to attack and small and marginalized group to rile up their voting base. \n\nIs that enough or do I need to explain it in even more detail for you? It requires a little bit of reading between the lines and context about the recent republican party campaign against LGBT people in preparation for 2024. But its not subtle.",

Idea being that parents should be the ones telling their kids about the concept of gender/sexuality, not schools. Disclaimer though, this is my only exposure to him in any capacity.\n\nTo play devil's advocate. Whether we want to admit it or not, kids are dumb and impressionable. Gender is a nuanced concept. Telling kids about how some boys are actually girls (and vice versa), they just don't know it yet is just gonna confuse the fuck out of a child.\n\nIn his tweet he specified children. Teenagers are developed enough to start to engage with these topics but even then, most people aren't comfortable with a teacher putting their social views in front of kids. I wouldn't want any teacher telling my kid that self ID is a great and valid thing.\n\nAnd there's a larger problem where there's likely hundreds of not thousands of people who will have read my comment to this point and assume I hate trans people or something. When in reality I'm absolutely pro trans *including* for children when necessary. Which is already a far more progressive stance than 95+% of the world.

Fortnite ditched the Save The World the moment their BR took off, which would have happened to Halo too likely. Halo is a fun game albeit needs a lot more content. But Halo staying its ground as a arena shooter is the most logical approch. 343 made a good game albeit with lacking network and content. \n\nInfleuncers saying Halo wouldnt survive without a BR is nonsense, its the influencers that wouldnt survive without a BR in the next game to keep them relevant.\n\nHalo could have been a LOT better than it is. But you can only blame 343 for fucking up content and the like for that. Not because it didnt get a BR.",

If that's the goal anyway.  \nI just don't see a future in Halo as it is right now. It will have to change something if it wants to get popular again. It's very challenging for Battle Arenas nowadays to retain players.",

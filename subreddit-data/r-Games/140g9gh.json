Gujian 3, Sword and Fairy 7, and Xuan Yuan Sword 7 are the only ones that have materialized so far out of the like 15+ that have been shown off in the last few years.",

There are always one or two games being pushed incredibly hard with advertising and production quality, and typically they come out and are... okay! Never amazing, rarely bad, but just _fine_.  \n\nThen you look at the developers behind the games and it makes sense. They always choose devs that have some experience with low-budget games that are reasonably competent, and then suddenly dump millions of dollars at their feet and say \"now make a blockbuster.\"  \n\nEventually there will be a Chinese dev team that is able to make the magic happen, but I think it's going to be a long time with the current All Eggs In One Basket At A Time approach.",

There are a TON more interactions between them all.  It's a LOT better than OT1,  but in the end, it's STILL what you didn't like (separate stories until the conclusion and aside from the \"crossed path\" chapters).\n\nI still recommend you give it a try if you can get it cheap, because it's definitely a really, really good game and it could be enough to make it all feel better for you...",

Like say if you break an opponent, the following characters turn will comment on who did it. Same applies if someone is KO'd, healed, low health etc.\n\nYou still have the various skits that play depending on who's in your party commenting on the current characters plot you're following. There's also skits in pubs that often includes many party members instead of just a one-on-one.\n\nThey don't take the interactivity as far as I would like, but it's a huge improvement. My biggest complaint the first game was also how little anyone interacted with each other. I only made it about half way through before I gave up. I enjoyed the second quite a bit and put a bit over 70 hours in before completing it.",

Especially in the main quests.\n\nSome of the best content are the side dungeons / secrets which does require you to figure some stuff out on your own. Typically it is with a characters path action that either solves it or helps push you in the right direction.\n\nThe exploration and combat system is still the biggest draw mechanically so if those didn't appeal to you at all I would probably pass.",

It streamlines a lot of classic JRPG mechanics but also has an upgrade system that is a bit convoluted that you can ignore. Its curated and well-paced but I personally thought there were a couple of difficulty spikes where I just gave up on a boss and lowered the difficulty. The core combat has an extra layer of happenstance and you'll be switching characters within combat more. Sometimes when you lose it'll feel more like you got unlucky than did something wrong.   The core combat is a lot of fun, though. It then introduces a secondary combat system which is less fun and half-baked imo. \n\nOctopath Traveler II has random encounters and doesn't heal your characters after battle unless you level. The 8 characters are given a lot more time to flesh out their own journey and as such its more of a slow burn. I feel that you have more control over combat and other areas than you do in Chained Echoes. I also think there is a higher potential of getting fatigued on OT2 than Chained Echoes just due to how many combats you'll encounter in the game.\n\nPersonally, I prefer OT2.",

The characters gaining full HP and SP when they level really keeps the item management easy for those who are just starting out in RPGs and maybe worried about random encounters. The overworld does a good job of dangling treasures and paths that lead off a different direction. \n\nFor me, it feels more like an RPG than a lot of games under that label these days even if the difference between Ambushing an NPC and Soothing an NPC is mostly in my imagination.",

There is just so much complexity to it when it comes to equipment, party composition and sub jobs. It's also mostly voice acted too which is a huge plus for me. The audio is great too, particularly the boss theme which sounds like something from a triple A game. The stories are also extremely good. You have some serious tonal stories while others are more lighthearted and comedic. I think that is a massive plus, as 8 'the world is ending' type narratives would grate on you after a while.",

I love JRPGs and turn based games but these are a big miss for me.\n\nThe characters and their stories range from 'decently interesting' to 'I never want to see you in my party ever', then theres how they perform in game. You essentially have four party members with their gameplay equivalent in the other four so you always end up with a basic cast of physical damage dealer, mage, cleric/healer, and utility no matter where you start. Once I get my core first four in both games I just didn't care about wanting to level up the other four because I had everything I needed in the first four.\n\nThen theres the boost system. I get the intent, creatively use boost points to break your opponent and then unleash massive damage while they're vulnerable. But often trash mobs feel like typical JRPG trash and boss fights feel like giant HP walls that overstay their welcome even when playing well. Theres other issues I have like individual story quality and the design makes everything feel disjointed but I don't want to turn this into a mega essay.",

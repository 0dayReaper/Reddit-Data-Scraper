Although about Monet, The Master\u2019s Pupil is not a direct biography. No language, written or spoken, describes the man or his life. The player experiences the ups and downs of his timeline over the course of the whole game. Fragments and emotions are filtered down and portrayed with an intricate soundscape and score.\r  \n\r  \nHand-painted with real paint and paper. Outside of Monet\u2019s masterpieces, hundreds of hours have been spent painting backgrounds, foregrounds and assets to sculpt a world that fits with Monet\u2019s changing style across his life.\r  \n\r  \nInspired by the likes of Braid and Limbo, no elaborate control system or twitch reflexes are needed. The twelve levels of The Master\u2019s Pupil slowly lay out sixteen main mechanics, including colour combining, flowing drafts, and breakable crystals, along with physics-based balls, blocks and actual pieces of paintings.\n\nComing to PC, Mac, and Switch very soon!",

The core of Crash Team Rumble is actually really fun &amp; well-crafted lol, like no joke, I played the closed-beta back in April &amp; had a blast with it. I'm legitimately really glad that they didn't waste time &amp; resources on Bash (*the original is a dreadful game*), and instead recontextualized classic Crash gameplay into this kind of competitive 3D collectathon platformer/brawler thingy. It seriously has the potential to be one of the legitimately good CB spin-offs ala CTR...but I can see how that might not come through when just looking at trailers lol, the game doesn't show that well.",

Just a new one inspired by the old, giving us a nice mario party competitor on non nintendo consoles/pc\n\nI'm glad to hear you liked your experience so far with this one because yeah so far it seemed lacking to people",

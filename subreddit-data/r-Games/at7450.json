That's not a bad thing at all, it was always just how I felt when he was up on stage.\n\nMaybe it's just the way he speaks, always making sure to hit the bullet points and use proper full titles for everything and such.\n\nI'm not trying to rag on Reggie or anything, I think he's done a great job with Nintendo and I'll miss him a lot. I just think that was the only \"manufactured\" part of his energy, as you mention. I have a sneaking suspicion that he wasn't really that excited to be done with his press conference and \"go back to playing New Super Mario Brothers U Deluxe, for my Nintendo Switch,\" or whatever game was relevant at the time. But he was absolutely excited to head out onto the show floor and meet the fans, and that's what truly matters.",

Hiroshi Yamauchi, the third president of Nintendo, and the guy that built it from a small card manufacturing company to what we know when we think of Nintendo, never played a video game and had no interest in them. He just saw the birth of a new market, and he put his company on a road to capitalize on it.",

The first time Reggie appeared in public as Nintendo's president he introduced himself with \"I'm about kickin' ass, takin' names, and makin' games.\" At industry events there would always be Sony and Microsoft putting on big impressive shows about slick new cutting-edge hardware and thrilling dark narratives, and then Nintendo would bring out their executives and producers dressed in costumes, fighting each other with inflatable hammers and slipping on banana peels. A lot of stuff Reggie said as part of presentations was goofy enough to become a meme, like \"My body is ready\" (when showing off a fitness game). A few times he insisted, or pleaded, that he be referred to as The Regginator or The Reggielution.\n\nWhen presenting their new fighting game, he [filmed this incredibly over the top Matrix-style kung fu battle in which he is killed by Nintendo's CEO.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdDYoCU2kv0)",

That scene where Peter saves the kid on the bridge is up there with the train scene from Spider-Man 2 in regards to great Spider-Man moments in film.",

Hmm...\"\n\nHe's a visual storyteller for sure but I think too much importance (and power) is placed on the director, and he only had one bullet in the gun.\n\nThere's this saying I hear in music, you take 20 years writing your first album and 6 months writing your second album, and I think that's what happened with Webb. He spent his whole life mentally figuring out 500 Days of Summer, but he couldn't really just snap his fingers and get that magic again to continue his career.\n\n(That said I liked a whole lot of his ASM movies.

He will be missed. Doug has big shoes to fill IMO. \n\nI think what made Reggie so unique was his wholesomeness. He wasn't there doing in your face stuff. When he said things like \"my body is ready\" he was just trying to be funny but not crude. Nintendo has to carry that. As someone who grew up in the 90s and every goddamn Nintendo thing was trying to be branded as edgy or whatever, it was just a relief to have Reggie who didn't market things that way or come at gamers with this in your face attitude. He knew to let the products speak for themselves (for themost part, lets not mentions wii music). I hope Doug has taken notes. People like Nintendo because it is Nintendo. It has a personality and presentation that is very genuine. ",

Nintendo really lucked out with the guy, there aren't many names you would cite alongside industry giants like Miyamoto and Iwata, but he was one of them.\n\nMany other industry big-names are joked about in a mocking way (David Cage, Peter Molyneux, Todd Howard), but with Reggie it felt like everyone was laughing alongside him, not at him. He's just THAT cool of a dude. Here's hoping Bowser caught on to what made people love Reggie and can become just as much a part of the community, I'd hate to see the goofy NOA sketches end with Reggie's retirement . \n\n",

Plus the things they've done there with open world and physics is just mind-blowing wizardry.\n\nXbox Series X, on the other hand, is supposed to be the peak of current console technology. It should be able to handle any game with mandatory 60 fps minimum.\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that the developers are clearly prioritizing eye candy at the expense of performance. So they push all the graphical bells and whistles and resolution to just below the point of instability at 30 fps. I know a big chunk of gamers prefer their games like that. It's just disappointing to us gamers who will sacrifice everything else at the altar of 60 fps. They could have given us the option of dynamic 1080p 60 fps and I personally would have preferred that.",

I can deal with 30 fps in older games if I have to, partially because the lower framerate is less noticeable at lower detail levels, but a new game running at 30 has to be something *extremely* special for me to even consider at this point. Let alone if it drops under 30 regularly, as Starfield seems to be doing often based on the showcase footage - I for one am completely done with playing games at that kind of performance level, and at that point I'd just consider it to be a broken product.\n\nPeople like to say that framerate shouldn't matter if the game is good enough, but performance is something that's *always* there, it's a core part of the visual presentation which is the main part of how we experience games, not to mention it also has an impact on gameplay. For me it's not something I can just look past as if it was just a bonus, rather it's an integral part of the experience and it just so happens that somewhere around 45 fps (with VRR) is where I'd consider motion to start being actually \"smooth\" and therefore not distracting.",

Unless you actually get very sick, i dont see why we should limit ourselves in experiencing great games just because of low fps\n\nDifferent perspective: \n\nI am a PC player since after the Playstation 1 era, or more precisely 98' / 99'. I haven't played a game at straight 30 fps since then for the most part (maybe a few console titles I played a bit at my friends homes that were 30 fps). \n\nEven back then most games run on my mid range rig at about 60 fps and during the 2000s I got used to playing at least with framerates in the 40s (while using a monitor with 85hz). \n\nIn the last 15 years I am positive of not having seriously played a 30 fps game, with nothing constantly below 60 for the last 10 years. And for the last 5+ years I am used to getting considerably more than 60 fps on my PC, with me surprisingly noticing after switching to a 4K screen (at 120 hz) and therefor a higher rendering cost than before that straight rock stable 60 fps even feel kind of bad in many titles. For example unlocking 120 fps was a giant difference to camera control in Sekiro, even though its a 3rd person game I played with a controller. Arguably for other titles 60 fps can be ok, for example I am playing both Fifa and Diablo 4 at 60 cause with the top down / isometric perspective I find 60 fps very fluid and hardly see a difference to 120 there.\n\nI wouldn't play a 30 fps game no matter what! At least not one that has any kind of camera movement. The lack of fluidity or more precisely the 'gap' between the pixel of a moving object between two frames is just such a deal breaker to me, that I can't go past. These days playing using a 48\" screen as a monitor doesn't help there either... Even if its the perfect game with the types of mechanics I always wanted in my favorite genre with an insane presentation and perfect story and so on, if its only running at 30 I want play it. \n\nAnd that is not just some idle talk, I remember being super hyped to have a good tablet and wanting to play GTA SA on it at a time I was warming up more to touch screen controls and was also spending a lot of time commuting (must have been back in 2013 or so). But realizing that it is only running at 30 fps tops (with a really dump opt-out frame lock to 20 I assume to save battery) I couldn't get used to it no matter how much I tried.\n\nI can understand that this all sounds weird for somebody used to playing on console where until this gen most games were still locked to 30 fps. Even somebody that might played some games in their 120 fps mode likely isn't as used to high framerates as someone that exclusively plays on PC (with a good enough PC for those games...) can't understand that. To me it would be like going back to VHS after being only used BR or 4K movies.",

Personally, I'd rather have a stable 30 FPS than have it be able to reach 60 but deal with constant drops in framerate.\n\nIf it's dipping into the 20s, then we're going to have a problem. My guess is they couldn't achieve a smooth 60 FPS gameplay without constant dips, so they're going with a stable 30 FPS.\n\nIt's kind of disappointing, considering most new current gen games can hit 60 FPS, but it is what it is, I guess.",

Triple buffered vsync allows your seen framerate only dip to, say, 25 FPS but it induces a lot of input lag. Double buffered means that any frame drop will drop you to an integer divisor of 30 FPS (so 20, 15, 10, or 5) but will have dramatically less input lag, so while it doesn't look great it feels significantly better.",

By the middle of the gen, 30 FPS only games will come out for sure (or else they won't focus on improving game graphics quality much but I doubt it).

Obviously the drops to 20 because of the double-buffering impact it but these aren't *that* frequent so it's workable.\n\nIn contrast Elden Ring for example has very uneven framepacing when running at 30 on consoles so feels worse to play - for some people of course, everyone is different in how sensitive they are to these things.",

This sub is hopelessly out of touch with mainstream gaming and consumers. As someone who has conducted several large scale market research projects on the gaming industry, I\u2019m literally dying laughing at some of these takes in this thread. \n\n60 fps is so fucking far down the priority list for 90+% of gamers that we don\u2019t even include it as a ranking option on some studies. I\u2019m not trying to be mean, but your **opinion** on what should be industry standard is wildly disconnected with reality. \n\nThe average consumer does not give a shit about 60 fps. I\u2019ve interviewed and surveyed *literally* hundreds of thousands of avid gamers and very rarely does frame rate ever pop up as a priority, much less an expectation. It\u2019s important to realize when discussing these games that for millions of consumers and 90+% of game purchasers that 30 fps is not even on their radar let alone a deal breaker. \n\nDo I personally prefer 60 fps? You betcha. But when you\u2019re a company investing hundreds of millions in game development expecting a certain ROI you\u2019re not going to jeopardize your investment by compromising on an element that the VAST majority of purchasers aren\u2019t even going to be aware of.",

The context is kinda left out though. In general people don\u2019t understand 30fps vs 60fps, stick with me. \n\nFor decades at this point PC gamers have understood it and it\u2019s been important, however console gamers have only really been made, like the last 5 years maybe? People have been trained basically all through their lives that resolution, or what they deem picture quality, is most important, which is why everything has gone to baseline 4k. \n\n60fps though is just something that a lot of people haven\u2019t experienced or haven\u2019t consciously. There\u2019s a reason why CoD dominated with its gameplay since like 2007, it\u2019s because they were one of the only ones to adopt 60fps gameplay on consoles then others like Battlefield went for \u201cprettier\u201d games with lower FPS. \n\nI firmly believe if you say someone down in front of screens playing a first person shooter, like Starfield, and gave them the options of 1080p 30fps, 1080p 60fps, 4k 30fps and 4k 60fps basically everyone would pick the 60fps choices with the majority not really being able to differentiate between 1080p and 4k. \n\nYou can \u201cfeel\u201d frames in playing or watching, higher resolution though is something that most people don\u2019t really notice in my opinion unless it\u2019s obviously blown out to like a 70\u201d screen.",

It\u2019s shocking how many people who spend 10+ hours a week gaming who don\u2019t even know what frame rate *is* and need it explained to them in interviews. And when it comes to testing, atleast in my research, resolution trumps all. Remember that movies still are at 24 fps. It\u2019s really just not something noticed by a casual observer. In your play test scenario you immediately notice the difference in fps. It seems hard to imagine as a non causal gamer, but there really *are* tons of people out there that *can\u2019t even tell the difference in 30 vs 60 fps* when playtesting and just prefer the prettier game. \n\nAlso, as a sidebar CoD\u2019s domination didn\u2019t have anything to do with frame rate. It was just the first polished realistic modern warfare (pun slightly intended lol) fps that was accessible to a casual audience. Back then the top dogs, were non realistic settings like arena sci fi (Halo) or military shooters that had high skill floors/ceilings that punished casual play (CS, Battlefield). CoD struck a gold mine by creating a game that looked realistic (modern day military setting) with an extremely low skill floor where anyone could pick it up and perform well, all while online gaming was still in a rapid growth stage.",

A game of this scope is going to be limited by its CPU, and there is just so much you can do with the one in current xboxes.  \n\nAlso 30fps (if it can actual hold at 30 with no dips) on a large TV across a room, for a relatively slow moving game, remains acceptable for the vast majority of customers.  Realistically, twitchy multiplayer shooters are the only genre that reliably hits 60fps on console and that's because they're carefully designed around that.  If you think that's an embarrassment I have some pretty bad news about your system going forward.",

They want to make a game where you are truly part of an experience that is changing all around you. Technology hasn\u2019t allowed them to do it but that\u2019s their mission. It\u2019s a crazy ideology and leads to issues like you mentioned (such as a lack of NPCs compared to other games due to the need to track all of them at all times) but if they can pull it off it\u2019ll be great. I think Starfield is doing the same thing, the Universe should be chugging along all the time, that\u2019s one reason it\u2019s such a CPU heavy game. I\u2019m sure areas that are undiscovered or on the periphery are monitored at a much lower level but they spent a lot of time working on their engine to get closer to their goal. That\u2019s why they haven\u2019t made ES6 yet, they didn\u2019t want to make that game until they could do it justice.",

I saw a couple of other people saying the same thing. If you're implying that the PS5 is somehow more powerful than the Series X because something like Horizon runs at 60 fps it isn't. Series X consistently has been targeting higher internal resolutions than the PS5 in cross platform titles because of the greater GPU horsepower it has available.",

And it seems like most people on here agree that it\u2019s fine given the scope. \n\nWhat I wonder now if people are gonna give the same pass to other ambitious titles or if this is just copium due to the hype surrounding the game and the (now) 1st party nature of it / exclusivity. \n\nI\u2019m sure we all remember Gotham Knights. Their reasoning was the unthethered co-op creating a CPU bottleneck for the game. In hindsight I think that\u2019s an actually pretty fair reason / excuse (the other issues surrounding the game no withstanding) but it got dunked on the no end regardless. While at the exact same time, A Plague\u2019s Tale Requiem ALSO released at 30fps but it \u201cmostly\u201d got a pass from gamers. The big difference? One was a Game Pass title being heavily marketed by Xbox, the other was not\u2026",

Now I'm concerned that other Xbox studios won't feel the need to pursue performance modes if they think people will settle.

It\u2019s like they just made it as a marketing gimmick early on.\n\nI bought a Series X because I didn\u2019t want the expense of building a PC, and I didn\u2019t want the time and hassle of building a PC, and I didn\u2019t want to get stuck in the constant upgrade cycle. I\u2019ve been there and done it.\n\nI want good gaming experiences, I want good stories, I want it to look pretty on my 4K TV, but I don\u2019t want to have to worry about whether my GPU/CPU/RAM/etc is good enough to play the game.\n\nI accept that consoles have limitations that I might not experience on PC, but it\u2019s a trade-off that I have chosen to save me time and money and hassle, and I think most console owners are in the same boat.",

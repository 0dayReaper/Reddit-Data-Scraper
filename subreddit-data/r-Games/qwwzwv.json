The last one, about his knowledge of the harassment problem, points to him intentionally concealing share price impacting information from the board. Maybe they figure waiting this out has a good chance of making his removal cheaper and smoother.\n\nI'm curious how long it'll be til he gets kicked off the board of Coca Cola and some of the other corporations he sits on.",

It takes a *lot* more than a temporary share price drop for a CEO to be removed from a Fortune 500 company. And I'm not ignoring the titular petition and all the other controversy, it's just that none of that stuff means jack shit to investors. The only way Kotick is going away is a couple of quarters of profit drop or if he himself decides to take his golden parachute. Welcome to Capitalism, it sucks.",

It's very rare to find highly skilled people in other fields, who would literally be willing to work for free or very little just to work on their favorite IP or for their favorite game dev studio, etc.\n\nIt's also a problem of utilization, any company that decides to be let's say \"ethical\" or \"fair\"; is essentially going to lose out on all that mass of grunts that come out to the chopping block. Outsourcing studios in game dev are probably the most infamous for this, even if you manage to transform one to do better or something; then some other one will grow or a new one will arise.\n\nYes companies exploit the laborforce, but it goes hand in hand with the willingness of it all. It's also not a completely one sided deal, companies get more out of it; but a lot of people go in to slave away their 1-3 years because they can add notable/famous IPs or companies to their resume, before moving on. I'm not sure how you break this cycle without inherently changing how people feel about the entertainment industry(especially video games &amp; movies).",

Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself as Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. **Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.**\n\n&gt; **Kotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and intellectual properties over the 1990s and 2000s**, among these being the Call of Duty and Guitar Hero series. A holding company was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding company merged with Vivendi Games (the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision serves to manage numerous third-party studios and publish all the parent company's games outside those created by Blizzard.",

The Board is likely afraid that swapping him will endanger the performance (and perhaps they are also protecting their buddy).\n\nAs consumers we want the products, and shareholders want their money, but at what cost? I don't want to support companies that encourage or tolerate that behavior. Profits, no matter how high, should not rely on exploiting and abusing your fellow humans.",

Plus, he likely owns a lot of votes on the board because he got them their jobs (and thus made them rich and powerful and their positions aren't secure without him because their chief duty is to show up at board meetings and vote with him).\n\nSo you're a board member who wants to remove him, but if you attempt to do so and fail, you're going to lose your position and power and be labeled as disloyal by any Kotick advocates. You have to choose a successor and find enough votes not **only** to kick out Kotick but who also back the successor.\n\nPlus, this may become even more complicated based on Kotick's contract, large stockholder's position on the subject, and the bylaws that govern how the corporation is run. Powerful men who build institutions of power don't build them to be just. They build them to maintain their power.\n\nYou can't have democracy and oligarchy. People should be able to become incredibly rich and own wonderful things and never have to work again, but they shouldn't be able to turn it into political and generational power that dwarfs that of the democracy. How we get there without creating a separate tyranny is the question.",

Call of Duty may be the fast food of video games but damn is a big mac good once in a while.\n\nIt feels shitty, to love a game series and have some of the people behind it be fucking awful human beings. And this is not limited to activision. If you love Ubisoft games you're in the same boat. If you love Rock star, CD projekt or Naughty Dog games then you have to live with those devs being worked to death.\n\nThe industry is in such a rough fucking spot right now. I'm young but even I can remember a time when whilst games were still made for money, but there was a passion there. Devs that wanted to work more did it out of passion, and shit like this Acitivison situation was much much rarer.",

But this does feel it should be a turning point because now you have Sony privately telling employees they\u2019re reaching out to talk to Activision and Microsoft publicly stating they\u2019re reviewing their relationship with Activision.\n\nTwo of the three platform holders for consoles (And it\u2019s not like Activision and Nintendo have a strong relationship, so it\u2019s also the two they have strong relationships with) signaling that these revelations about Bobby and the board standing with him regardless have them reaching out or reviewing their relationship *is* a big deal. \n\nWhen was the last time Sony said this? Microsoft? This is a big deal. And it\u2019s also seems like this is hurting throat ability to retain employees, it\u2019s causing very public walkouts, their attempt to do damage control by replacing the head of Blizzard has backfired, and this story initiated as something that was largely a as Blizzard problem. The story has gotten bigger, not smaller. Bobby can\u2019t manage the PR and it\u2019s become clear why: he\u2019s implicated.\n\nBut I think Bobby will be around for a bit yet, but it feels like this must be a turning point. And I think the Board will need to be taking strong action because they\u2019re in a lawsuit with the State of California: do they want the state to be coming in and cleaning house for them?",

No, I'm talking someone who has pre-ordered and is counting the days basically. \n\nI'm trying to discover this game's intended audience because no matter who I speak with, no one has any interest in it - even though it's gonna be on Game Pass, and even though it's from Capcom, who are doing better than they ever have.",

I think folk more get hyped for sequels than new IP for preorder stuff) but I've been keeping an eye on it because it seems like kinda dumb, jump in/hop out fun in a similar way to Daemon x Machina, and I like that vibe. And it looks like it's got pretty enjoyable gameplay. \n\nI would say I'm counting the days to see what people think of it when they've got their hands on it since that's when I know if I'll want to give it a shot, if that counts? /shrug Might try bullyin' some folk I know in to trying it with me if it ends up being a solid romp. I think there's also that it looks like it's more targeted to domestic japan in marketing with overseas being an afterthought skewing the answers of who you might ask. I haven't seen a ton of marketing for it anywhere so that might key into that you're not hearing a ton of hype.",

Given that it's not coming out for another month, he's kinda forgotten about it.\n\nMy excitement is practically dead because there's seemingly little word on whether or not a cross-platform party (e.g. players from PC + PS5) is in the launch version. The beta didn't have it and the only way we could be on the same team was if we joined the queue at the same time and hoped it'd pair us together. It did, but likely because there were so few people playing. If it's not in then it's a 100% no-buy for me (which would actually be two copies since I'd be buying my nephew his as well).",

Every major big name capcom game since RE7 has had its marketing heavily on PS and each one of those games has done really both in sales and reviews. Then you have this game which is the best boy multi platform game of theirs not being marketed by PS.\n\nAlso add in the game will be day one of Gamepass.",

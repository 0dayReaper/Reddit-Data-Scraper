Infinitely cheaper than a new graphics card would have been, and although the drop in pixel count took a few weeks to get used to, you eventually stop really noticing the difference. Games have never looked or played better to me and it really gave my PC a new lease on life. Instead of getting a choppy experience with poor frame pacing, and games seldom syncing with my monitor\u2019s refresh rate, now games play at a buttery smooth locked 70 or 80fps on ultra settings.\n\nI honestly feel like I got sold on a meme buying a 4K monitor with my 2080ti in 2019. 1440p is still the way to go for now, and probably will be until the 50s series nvidia cards are here.",

You can get a 2070 Super for dirt cheap used as well. When people complain a GPU prices they aren't complaining about overall GPU prices, or performance over 2 gens ago they are complaining about the high end namely the 4080 going up $500 in price. A 4070 is equivalent in HW to a 1080(massively better performance + features though) and it's cheaper than the $700 1080 founders edition despite the rampant inflation since.\n\nBut if you're going from a 3070 to a 4070 the gains aren't as good as you'd hope in raster(without enabling features) but this is something ALL the industry is tangling with.

This wasn't like when 1080p became mainstream. Currently displays are distributed across 1080, 1440, and 4k... but even top end cards still struggle on high settings above 1440p.\n\nAt the same time, there's huge disparities in the graphical requirements of games. You can get ugly games with crazy high rec specs just for 1080 gaming at 60fps... but then you have great looking games with minimal requirements you can play at 4k.\n\nThis means that many will be more comfortable sticking with their 10XX era cards because they're great at 1080p, and people.will see the performance of some new major games and see that even the best new cards still struggle. So unless you're super struggling or absolutely want to play one specific game at 1440p 60 high settings... why get a new card? Graphics just haven't stepped up that much lately to justify the ever worsening performance, either.\n\nRaytracing is cool, but still a huge performance hit for something rarely that well implemented.\n\nI bought a 3060ti last year, and am pretty confident it'll be fine as my card for as long as my 1060 was.",

And lower and cards like RTX 4060 Ti, are just plain bad in general, in some games not even beating predecessor - RTX 3060 Ti, which comes faster due to higher memory bandwidth. So costs the same as predecessor, is barely faster on average, has lower memory bandwidth and has only 8 PCIE lanes which further down screws older system users, and many gamers have still fast enough CPUs, but on PCIE 3.0 limited motherboards, only 8GB VRAM buffer.\n\nRTX 4070 -/Ti, while generational leap here is more acceptable, still skimpy 12GB VRAM buffer which will become issue, especially with RT enabled, which this card can handle but may not over memory limitation.\n\nFinally you have real high end cards - RTX 4080 / 4090 and RX 7900 XT/XTX which are just stupidly expensive.\n\nSo yeah, reason across the board not buy unless absolutely necessary, like you're stuck with few gen old cards that can't play anything new that comes out or your current GPU died. But periodic GPU upgrades to keep playing at very high settings became a big no for many people due to those reasons, but mainly inadequate pricing. It's great time as never before to just drop down graphical settings and say \"this doesn't look all that bad\".",

She said that their influence on the market is generally minimal and does not exceed 5%\u201310% of the total demand.  \n\n&gt; Andy Long, CEO of White Rock Management, a digital asset technology company situated in Switzerland, agreed with Su that mining isn't entirely to blame:\n\n&gt;&gt; \u201cGPUs are still in high demand to power Ethereum and other altcoin mining.

Sumco Corp, the second-largest manufacturer of wafers, said that its production is booked until 2026.\n\nMinimum 2026 before (ever increasing) backlog is done.\n\n&gt; ... two Russian companies, Ingas and Krion, produce 45%\u201354% of the world\u2019s supply of neon-containing gas mixtures.\n\nUnless we can make alternative supply lines, the Ukr-Rus war threatens to make another crisis immediate.

Had I waited a few more months, I could have gotten a better deal on that card, and if I had waited until 2023, I could have gotten a 6950 for that price.\n\nNow I'm in a position where I want to upgrade but I have sunk cost in this overpriced GPU I paid for because I didn't really have a choice. And I know I'm far from the only one.\n\nSales are down because prices are outrageous. Even after normalizing, the new gen of cards is ludicrously overpriced for the value. The only thing that makes sense is buying old gens, but then you have people like me who were almost forced to buy them when they were high so there's no cost-effective way.",

It used to be that you get more performance with the same amount of power when you upgraded, now you get more performance because they just use more electricity.\n\nBesides the fact that I obviously don't want to waste energy, that's also a lot of heat that will get generated, which sucks especially during Summer.",

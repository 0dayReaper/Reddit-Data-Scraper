            "comment": "All of the best Attack on Titan games are fan projects so I'm hesitant to have any confidence in this, especially after seeing that it's only a concept and no actual gameplay is ready to show off. I don't even understand why they felt the need to release this trailer when things are in this state.  \n\nIf you want the best Attack on Titan game, Roark's fan game is by far the best. Admittedly, it lacks any titans and only offers PvP or time trials and practice modes, BUT the movement system is near perfect. Seriously, they should just pay the man for his code and put it into an official release, its so good. Reminds me a ton of the Ps2 Spiderman game but allows for a ton more player control over momentum and direction.",

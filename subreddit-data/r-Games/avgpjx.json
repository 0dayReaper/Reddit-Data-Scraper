I haven't played *Plague Inc.* for a while, so I didn't know they added something like that.\n\nEdit: A couple of people have commented by saying that it could also describe *X-Men*, but I think *Hero Academia* is more applicable because the event that gives humans superpowers happens suddenly, and to the extent that humans with superpowers are actually the vast majority.",

And we see her using her quirk to do simple things like carrying laundry and bags, or handing objects to others while washing the dishes.\n\nIn other words, she put on weight as a result of abusing her quirk for a whole life. Not too much, as she's still active, but definitely a part of it. And I'm sure that looking pudgy is essentially an invisible trait in a world with radical mutations, so  the worry wasn't there.",

Of course, it hasn't helped her at all, but she would've been large through-out her life. It's more possible that's she gained weight simply due to getting older, being a housewife, and being less active.

So it's not quite that non-quirky are completely treated as beneath regular people, at least past their youth, since the vast majority of people doesn't have any spectacular abilities or even gets a special chance to put them to use in the first place.\n\n*As in, the first heroes, which we never see and only hear about in passing, were all acting vigilantes for good (invoking your usual Marvel/DC setup) and the profession is only legal by the time of the series, alongside regular standardized police taskforces, due to the first ever heroes not messing up their public image.

The point he kept trying to push was that he didnt trust that the government was being honest about what all they were putting in the vaccines, and he was convinced that the vaccines were a legitimate preventative measure for diseases but that the government was also including unnecessary additional chemicals in them for some nefarious industrial profiteering and control. \n\nHe believed that the government was working with the medical treatment industry giants to expose people to harmful things on purpose to help sustain a profitable medical business in the US, and promoting cancer etc. So that people will pay millions for treatment. \n\nIt's all of course without evidence. However I dont think it's simple as saying \"They hate science\" and in fact just generalizing it like that may make it more difficult to solve the problem as theyll just see us making claims that they see as an attack on their character rather than an attack on their argument. \n\n",

When those illnesses are a serious problem everyone trusts that the vaccine is the best way to protect themselves. They see the effects of the illness and know that any possible side effects of the vaccine is preferable.\n\nAntivax ideology becomes a problem because society hasn\u2019t seen the real dangers of an unvaccinated populace. Literally days ago I was having a fight with an antivaxxer on Reddit claiming that vaccines are causing as much or more damage than vaccine-preventable illnesses. They were comparing the amount of people awarded settlements through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to the amount of people dying to things like the Measles. Completely ignoring that the reason more people aren\u2019t dying to vaccine-preventable illness is BECAUSE people are vaccinated.",

Just like we threaten parents with jail time for truancy, we should threaten anti vaxers with these real consequences. \n\nThe whole Reddit anti-anti-vax shit is just circlejerking. Doesn't really do much.",

For example in the normal game you can just make the disease infectious and refund random mutations of symptoms for extra dna until the whole world is infected then make it deadly. Virus on the other hand costs dna to get rid of mutations so you have to go for a different strategy. ",

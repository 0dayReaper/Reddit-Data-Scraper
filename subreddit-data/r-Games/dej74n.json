And they did. Unquestioningly.\n\nThis could all get unpleasantly exciting in the next 20 years or so.",

You can start anytime.\"), and gave him the platform to say it, albeit savvy enough to protect themselves by cutting themselves out of the frame.\n\nIn case anyone wants to know, their comments after the interview: \"Was that interview too short? I think that was enough, I think talking about anything else will [muddle the message]\" (I assume they didn't even talk about the game).\n\nEDIT: The eight words the player said were: \"\u5149\u5fa9\u9999\u6e2f \u6642\u4ee3\u9769\u547d\", which is the slogan of the Hong Kong protests. Translates to: \"Reclaim Hong Kong, [it is the] era of revolution\"",

When China releases their numbers, like other countries, on number of people arrested people who are being held waiting without trial and people in these \"re-education\" camps arent counted as any type of prisoner.\n\nTheir most famous prison holds the previous president's military generals. When the Party puts someone new in charge, they typically wipe the military power that served directly under him as well. This includes spouces. This specific prison is so full they cant do the yearly tradition of the prisoner's family would come in on their birthday and share a meal with the prisoner. They have too many prisoner's sharing that same birthdays so they scrapped it. China supposedly has 600k less prisoners than the US, but the US includes people out on bail in their numbers. The US still has way too many people in prison, and needs serious fucking reform like yesterday, but everytime people compare US prison to other countries no one every brings up countries like China or Japan where it wasnt until 90s and 2000s where Japan was still getting forced confessions.",

When I heard that the low murder rate was partly due to classifying unsolvable murders as suicides and that the police routinely coerced prisoners to confess with marathon interrogations that can last weeks with no lawyer present I realized how terrible their system is.\n\nApparently the vast majorities of convictions are confessions and the police are routinely accused of being less than interested in investigating cases that don't have a confession attached and that basically, well, they aren't very good at actually investigating things because the usually try not too. Now Japan does have a very low violent crime rate regardless but it's clear their system needed some big reforms.",

Why do you think, for example, the number of companies that have thrown money into celebrating Pride Month has absolutely exploded in the past decade?  It's not because Amazon just loves the LGBT community and has been a stalwart symbol of Pride... 9 times out of 10, it's because public opinion has finally shifted to the point that they've decided it's more profitable to look progressive on the issue than not.",

There can be no ethical consumption under it, as long as people are being exploited for their labor. \n\nPeople also like stories. You wanna reach them? Don't talk about the thousands of kids slaving away at the factories to create their latest Zara purses; this is faceless, soulless, just a number. Instead, talk about one or two kids, give them a name, their story, their life, and people will care more.\n\nRemember Kony 2012? It was a problem well before the campaign started. The world didn't give a shit. Until someone put a name to it, and create the narrative. Then people supported it. \n\nBecause people don't want to think about these things, ordinarily. It makes their lives less meaningful and more futile, as they're being accomplices in the exploitation by enjoying their fruits. Your average iPhone user doesn't care about the mining conditions of those scavenging the earth for the materials to make them, or the living arrangements of those in the factories assembling them. A factory worker tries to jump and commit suicide? Sad. But I gotta have the iPhone 134 with a marginally better camera!",

I lost interest in WoW 10 years ago now, and Hearthstone ran out of gas quickly for me... as did Overwatch.\n\nI'm pretty much done with them at this point to be honest, but if they came out with a new StarCraft game I would probably be tempted. StarCraft II was really good if you ask me - didn't measure up to the first game, but that is a really tall order.\n\nIt's weird to feel that way considering that 15 years ago I would have bought literally anything Blizzard put out. But frankly they are an entirely different company now.",

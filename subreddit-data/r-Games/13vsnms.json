It's like over time they devolved into just another generic sci fi series but with cutesy mascots.

The movie put me straight to sleep. There's no character to ANYTHING anymore.",

Take TOTK for example, you\u2019ve got the big bombastic orchestral sound for the main theme, but then other tracks might be solo piano, or a smaller ensemble with guitar and drums and so on. Really gives the soundtrack more range and it makes you pay attention when they bust out the full orchestra.",

It is one of those things that they told shareholders to justify PS4 not having backwards compatibility, and then created data to support it by offering god awful emulated versions of PS2 games on the PS4 that gave a significantly worse experience vs the native ports they got on the PS3. It started as BS to appease shareholders but now they just believe it.\n\nThe irony of course being that Uncharted 4 on PC launched the same day as Persona 5 Royal, an enhanced port of a PS3 game that probably sold better than the Uncharted port that dropped players right into the last chapter of a story with no ability to get the earlier parts.",

Emulated PS2 games on PSN was also a thing on PS3, some of them had HD ports on PS3 but many did not. None of them sold that well. Still, I think people would buy PS3 era games on PC at least but they don't have priority, i think they'll get there later eventually. Later games sell better so they take priority.",

It's really fast paced and they added/improved some traversal tools that make it more fun to get around the maps. I would have preferred more challenging puzzles and platforming but generally it was very enjoyable.",

I don't see them ever giving up timed console exclusives however, or doing same-day console/PC releases\n\nIt should hold, since it's their stated aim and it's making them money. I would wager some might be even longer.",

That doesn't make them anything. I kind of want a PS5 but don't want to drop that much money on it at it's current price.\n\nNow instead I bought Returnal, Uncharted, and will definitely buy this so they've got a customer back that they wouldn't have had otherwise. I'm usually fine waiting for the games.",

I did a loading test, just between PCs. It is not as fast as PS5, but still it is just under five seconds to load the game from the menu on nearly any modern PC with an NVME drive. It is very fast in comparison to other PC games. Still, what is actually the bottleneck in loading times on PC? Is it the IO-stack there (which even DirectStorage's first version without GPU decompression tries to address) or is it CPU limitations?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Jurjen Katsman (Nixxes studio head)**: I am not certain if decompression is actually the bottleneck for load times as we did do some things to make decompression go faster, but we backed out on some of those that were hurting the in-game loading (streaming). As in-game (as in streaming while in game, moving around) with those decompression speed-ups in place, we were taking too much CPU away from the game. So we backed that away, and it didn't really meaningfully impact loading screens.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I think other things that do play into it probably is shader compilation that's happening during loading screens, and you mentioned BVH building before, so that is also happening. There's a variety of little things that we do on PC, some of it would be the IO stack... We have some DirectStorage experiments but especially for a loading screen we can use all the CPU for loading, that's what the loading screen is about, right? It's not that suddenly the IO stack change is suddenly going to make it go four times as fast. For in-game purposes, I think that's when when it \\[Direct Storage\\] becomes interesting, right when there's this CPU core being fully utilised just to facilitate decompression, freeing up that CPU core if we were able to do that... that would be that's an exciting future, but not where we we're at right now.",

The people who are now in control clearly only wish to milk the license for what they can.",

And we know that some escaped the war of wrath and hid. The one that awoke and fought Gandalf could have just been the biggest one in the mines of Moria as they are known - if this game has you digging further down or searching for hidden caverns, who knows if there are anymore.",

There are more than one, and some may still exist.\n\nThere is a reason they left Moria. Without the rights to the stuff in LotR, they would have to dance around that and not actually deal with the canon. Also, saying the game is set in the fourth age is gibberish with just the content from the Hobbit. There weren't different ages that early in Tolkien's published work. There wasn't Sauron, and the ring that Bilbo found wasn't the ring of power. It was just a magical trinket, and Gollum was fully aware and willing to give it up as a prize. Stuff was retconned when he expanded the world and wrote Lord of the Rings.\n\nImagine you were trying to make some sequel game to the Bible, but you only had rights to the old testament. You could do that, but for what a lot of people think of as the Bible, your story is going to seem pretty weird.",

He exists alone until he creates the the Ainur, which act essentially as demi-gods / angels. Together they create music which is then brought into existence in the form of Arda, aka the world.\n\nOf the Ainur, the most powerful were the Valar, and they went into the world to actually finish its creation. The Maiar were less powerful and served the Valar. Gandalf and the other wizards/istari, the balrogs, and even Sauron were all Maiar. The most powerful Valar, Melkor, wove his own discordant themes into the music/creation, and he serves as the big bad until he is eventually defeated after long and cataclysmic wars. Sauron is his lieutenant, and essentially takes over. The wizards are then sent to middle-Earth to lend assistance and deal with Sauron.\n\nYou also have fun things like Ungoliant, the mother of Shelob and the other great spiders, who was just some primal evil force that existed without clear explanation. There is Tom Bombadil, who was also very powerful but intentionally never explained.",

But since it's so old, it's in public domain, which means Neowiz doesn't have to get permission from anyone to make it, nor are they required to give anyone money to make it.\n\nThe same will happen to the Hobbit in a few years, but *only* the Hobbit. So stuff mentioned in other LotR books or the Silmarillion can't be alluded to in a hobbit game, hell, while Sauron *technically* appears in it he can only be called \"The Necromancer\" instead. So just as Neowiz took a story about an Italian puppet traveling the countryside and made it about a boy wandering Belle Epoque France and fighting robots, someone could make a Hobbit adaptation but instead set it in like a cyberpunk space colony and the \"Lonely Mountain\" can be a computer that Middle Earth's greatest hacker Bilbo Baggins has to get into.",

The only missing piece is that Embracer only purchased the rights in 2022 which does, in part, explain why access to the IP for games has seemingly increased in the last year or so. The above comment appears to be correct that the Tolkien estate has had absolutely nothing to do with game rights since 1968.",

The Tolkien estate only hold the Silmarillion license and Christopher once said that he rather the book went out of print than seeing another adaptation. So I think out of respect to Christopher, the estate still wouldn't allow anyone to adapt the Silmarillion. That's why Amazon had to rely on the appendices of LOTR to make the Rings of Power.",

He has taken an enchanting and unique work of literature and retold it in the terms of the modern action picture. If Tolkien had wanted to write about a race of supermen, he would have written a Middle-Earth version of \"Conan the Barbarian.\" But no. He told a tale in which modest little hobbits were the heroes. And now Jackson has steered the story into the action mainstream. To do what he has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver.\n\nIf the most mainstream movie critic felt like that, imagine how the son of Tolkien who didn't grew up watching movies felt?",

The Two Towers novel is basically split into two halves, one of which very much covers the heroics of the non-Hobbits. And Jackson does portray the hobbits as the real heroes. I guess a few major parts of Frodo and Sam's story got shifted into the 3rd movie and Two Towers kinda turned into a war film.",

If you're going to make the art style of characters look one particular way, you should make the environment look like that, too. Not throw in textures that had high res scans.\n\nImagine Super Mario 1, the original NES release with photogrammatry. My stomach would turn. I'd get nausea from that uncanny valley.\n\n\\*goes off to look if someone already did that\\*",

But I'm down for another one. Had a fair bit of fun with Valheim with friends,. but you reach a point where you've done all the things and progressed through and the mystery is gone, which is the fun part for me.

                            "comment": "As far as games go, it has nothing to do with that.\n\nAs you alluded to, JRR Tolkien himself sold the film rights for LotR and The Hobbit to the Saul Zaentz Company. They would go on to create *Tolkien Enterprises* (later \"Middle-earth Enterprises\") to manage those rights. Along with the film rights, there were associated rights such as physical merchandise. SZC would go on to monetize these rights to the greatest extent possible, including video games not affiliated with any films in particular. The *Tolkien Estate* (Tolkien's family) would eventually take issue with a number of these monetization efforts, including digital video games (not even fulfilling the *physical* requirement for these products). They sued, but eventually settled leaving the status quo more or less as is.\n\nThe SZC would eventually go on to sell these rights to the Embracer Group, the same which has often been posted about on this sub. While this is closer in time to these sub-par games being made, I don't think that has much to do with it. The Gollum game, for example, had been in development for years prior to Embracer acquiring the rights. The truth is that the SZC had never been all that particular about who they sell the rights to or what others do with it. As long as they saw the efforts as profitable to them, they were happy to license out their rights. Embracer doesn't seem to have changed that mentality, but it's not something particularly new.\n\nAs an aside, I would say Christopher stepping down from the reigns of the Estate and his eventual passing did have a different effect. It is true that the Estate since then has become more (but not totally) interested in commercial partnerships. While the *film* rights (and, evidently, video game) rights were sold to SZC, Tolkien and later the Estate retained the *television* rights. This is why when Amazon began their efforts for their TV series based on LotR, they licensed the rights from the Estate and not SZC/Middle-earth Enterprises.",

Tolkien. Summoned to the Misty Mountains by Lord Gimli Lockbearer, players take control of a company of Dwarves tasked to reclaim the lost spoils from the Dwarven homeland of Moria\u2014known as Khazad-d\u00fbm or Dwarrowdelf\u2014in the depths below their very feet. Their quest will require fortitude, delving deep into the Mines of Moria to recover its treasures.\n\nSet in a procedurally generated Dwarven realm of Moria, no two adventures will be alike, and every expedition is traversable either solo or online with companions. Players can mine to craft greater gear and resources, but beware mining makes noise, and noise created in the quiet deep threatens to awaken the dangers below: where there's clatter, there's combat. Excavate the mysteries of three legendary mountains, extract precious metals, scrape to survive, and battle unspeakable forces to learn the secret of the Shadow that lurks within.\n\nKEY GAME FEATURES\nFEEL THE FELLOWSHIP:\nExperience the Fellowship of the Dwarves like never before, with the rich lore of the iconic fantasy world from J.R.R. Tolkien interwoven into the very fabric of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.\n\nSURVIVE THE DARK:\nTo survive the treacherous mines of Moria players must conserve resources, hunt and gather for food and manage their sleep, temperature and noise levels. Utilize dynamic light systems for safety and to blaze a path further into the darkness. Battle unspeakable evils and survive hordes of monstrous Orcs in visceral combat, while uncovering the secret of the Shadow that looms within the mountain.\n\nBASE BUILDING:\nFind solace from the darkness. Reveal and clear new locations to create architecture on a grand scale. Get creative and construct bases from scratch or build upon the existing environment. Beware the evils which seek to destroy Dwarven progress.\n\nREBUILD AND RESHAPE MORIA:\nRestore the long-lost ancient kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm to its former glory, recovering Dwarven landmarks as the story progresses. Resurrect old mines and refire their forges to yield their untouched resources.\n\nEXPLORE:\nDelve into the depths of the Mines of Moria. Procedurally generated environments are abundant with resources and fraught with mystery and danger, providing a unique experience each and every time.\n\nCO-OP MULTIPLAYER:\nAdventure alone or band together with friends in online cooperative multiplayer with up to eight players.\n\nCRAFT DWARVEN TOOLS, WEAPONS AND MORE:\nCraft and loot legendary Dwarven armor, tools, weapons and structures. Rebuild ancient forges to strengthen, repair and enchant gear. Upgrade and unlock new technologies and fantastical machines.\n\nUNCOVER MAGIC ARTIFACTS:\nDiscover ancient magic items including swords that glow when orcs are near, maps of long-dormant Mithril veins, books with forgotten crafting plans and amulets that give strength or wisdom.\n\nMINE ORE AND JEWELS:\nEstablish mines to unearth deposits of precious resources such as iron, gold, and quartz; and fantastical materials such as Mithril. Access crafting stations and forges to convert ore to ingots and upgrade gear. But be prepared, mining is loud and can awaken what lurks in the darkness.\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE DWARF BUILDER:\nPlayers become part of Dwarven Legend as they create their own Dwarf in the custom character creator. Dwarves can be customized in a variety of ways to create a unique Dwarven identity. Then, during gameplay, players can find and craft armor and weapons to further enhance their unique style.",

Because if so, it's a horrid misrepresentation of the lore.\n\nGimli never tries to reclaim or 'loot' Moria, the one to do so in the fourth age was Durin VII. Balin attempted to reclaim and loot it, but this was during the Third Age. \n\nThe Glittering Caves is what Gimli establishes and becomes king of. Geez, this game is gonna be a disaster isn't it?",

It's just odd because they could have just replaced 'Gimli' in the game summary with 'Durin VII' and it would have fit.\n\nIt's sorta like how Shadow of War could have made the spider lady Ungoliant instead of Shelob because there was more wiggle room for it. Them not doing so sorta says that their knowledge of the lore is shallow or surface level.",

            "comment": "One problem I have with speech builds or pacifist playthroughs in RPGs is that they are always disproportionately more busted than combat. A lot of the times if feels like an \"I win\" button as opposed to meaningful diplomacy, especially when the game flat out tells you \\[this is a speech check\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this game somehow gets around that then it would be interesting.",

I know for sure it was in Fallout 2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut again with your point on Fallout it did actually have an additional requirement for the diplomatic option at the end of the game. You need Evidence as well. I think Arcanum did something similar too.",

I tried to talk down a bad guy through the Utilitarian speech options available to me. He turned hostile and had to rely on my party members to win.\n\nIn my second playthrough I maxed combat skills and Strength, leaving Charisma at minimum. This time, I picked an aggressive dialogue option that I was unable to select in my prior playthrough and it caused him to back down. Strength is a stat that influences \"intimidation\" though nothing was ever marked as specifically so.\n\nI noticed several other small differences in what my character was capable of noticing or doing as a result of the different builds.\n\nThe game seems to do a very good job of creating differences for each ethos and not making Charisma an \"I win\" build.",

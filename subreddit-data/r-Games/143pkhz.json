For anyone who doesn't know and wants to go down the rabbit hole, there's been some serious accusations against WATA games and Heritage Auctions(co-founded by Jim Halperin, famous for Coin collector scams). Some of those included secretly buying and selling games amongst a group of accomplices that was meant to artificially inflate the market.\n\nBrief article but a couple years old: https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/record-video-game-auction-prices-may-be-a-result-of-fraud-3027627\n\nAlso, Karl Jobst's Youtube channel has some good videos on scammers, including the retro game auction scandals.",

People like myself who bought call options at $20-30 at the start of the Dec and watched it peak to $300+ towards the end of the month saw exponential returns. I look back on this feverish time fondly, but it's unfortunate that there are always those that buy at an extremely overbought peak because of 'tulip madness' and Fomo.\n\n\n\nBeing prudent and lucky on a stock pick is one thing but it was wild because of the sheer amount of social chatter and retail involvement creating positive feedback loops.",

If they were just claiming that WSB isn't a great place in general to take stock advice from, then the only criticism I'd have is that it's not really on topic.  \n\nBut instead, they thought they'd go for some easy karma by taking a cheap shot at one of the corporations this sub considers a fair target (and would you look at that: it worked), except that they were completely wrong.  GME isn't evidence of WSB being a bad place to take stock advice from.  It isn't evidence of the opposite either, but the fact that it's *still* worth many times over what it was when WSB started pushing it makes OP's first post completely nonsensical.\n\n&gt;it's basically gambling when trying to predict what stocks will come out ahead on WSB.\n\nNo shit.

Your original post had a pretty clear intent, and it was wrong.

The first day the GameStop thing started I had a piqued interest in the stock market and during my lunchbreak I kept thinking \"Investing might be interesting. What's a stock that's going to bounce back after the pandemic?\" and arrived at AMC. However, I was too nervous to invest actual money, so I used one of those stock market simulator websites and invested a fake $5000 into it intending to possibly do so later. Within a week or so the stock doubled. I knew it was meaningless internet bullshit and right around the peak I sold it. Now, here I was with a ton of fake money that could have been real money. I'm not sure if I learned a lesson about trusting my gut or being lucky but I'm still salty about it.",

There's three players here for new games/hardware - GameStop, Smyth's, and Argos.\n\nGameStop are finished tomorrow, but Argos (who aren't a gaming store, but rather a big electronics/home store that sells games, consoles, high-end televisions, home cinema kits, other relevant components like SSDs) are a UK-based company and are pulling out of Ireland entirely as well before the end of this month.\n\nSo we're effectively just left with Smyth's now (effectively an Irish version of somewhere like Toys'R'Us). Admittedly they are great at least, and there's good reason why they took a sizeable chunk of GameStop's pie.",

They saw the sinking ship of video rental stores, and pivoted into being a game store, doing things like Dungeons and Dragons, selling board games, selling merchandise, providing space for local gaming events, and other things you would expect from a local game store.\n\nGamestop absolutely can and absolutely should make the exact same transition. The actual purchase of phsical video games is becoming less and less profitable as the days go on - meanwhile, the demand for spaces where people can interact offline and in a community-like space is growing. I remember a few years ago, GameStop actually had plans to remodel some of there stores into something like this. It's too bad nothing really came of it. They already dedicate a ton of floor space to selling merch and nerd-adjacent things that aren't video games. It really wouldn't be too crazy of a pivot for them to make.",

There's no reason to assume the decision was made to try and make gamestop more evocative of a japanese game center\n\nThe idea behind the change was more than likely made because it's a logical conclusion to make for your business to stand out when the alternative is simply being a retailer that has to compete with Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, etc. You can't *just* be a brick and mortar retailer these days and gamestop will never beat the other companies on the digital store front. Japan has nothing to do with this\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I actually have seen asian style pc/console lounges pop up over the last few years. My local mall has a couple. I don't know how successful it is, but I have seen it crowded up from time to time for a 12 year olds birthday or whatever. I don't think it's some impossible idea that is completely incompatible with American culture or anything.",

It is slowly dying now, as shown by Sega shutting down most if not all of its arcades in recent years. But it used to be huge.\n\nWhile it was an exaggeration to say that the arcade scene doesn't exist at all in America, it doesn't change that it hasn't been very profitable, and several times less so after covid. It's just not a good idea to pivot a dying business model toward *another* dying business model.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt doesn't surprise me how you zeroed in on the Japan comment as an attack considering how much time you spend posting in anime and manga subreddits.",

No joke I've seen living rooms with twice the space of our floor, and my bedroom is is twice the size of our stock room.\n\nAnd the other 3 GameStops I've been in the stockroom is a similarly small fraction of the total space, in fact a smaller fraction, albeit they have larger overall stores.",

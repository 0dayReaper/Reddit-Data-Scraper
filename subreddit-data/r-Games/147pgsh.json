    "postText": "I like the games I play. I hope that's true of most of you. The games I spend my time on, I think they are fun, I have a good time playing them. Often, after a while of sinking my teeth into a game and finding I really like it, I will seek out an online community for that game, to look for builds or strategy or to just  get a little community around it.\n\nAnd every time, without fail, when I find those communities and start participating, people seem to hate the game.\n\nThe parade of negativity is endless, the complaining or dramatic \"I'm leaving\" type posts or the constant drum beat of the devs being idiots who don't know what they are doing, it's all consuming. It's ceaseless, and they are the posts that are most interacted with. In fact unless these communities do some kind of quarantine effort, like making a \"complaints\" thread and directing all such posts where, the negativity can quickly consume the community and become 80% or more of what you see. This is certainly true of the current day and reddit, but has always been true, going back to the message boards for old MMOs.\n\nEssentially, if you gauged audience reaction only by a sentiment assessment of the online communities, nobody likes anything, and fans all hate the games they play and spend time on them as a begrudging obligation.\n\nThink of the very best \"games as a service\" type game you know. The best of the best, the one that does it right, top of the industry. Go ahead and name it. Now go to their subreddit, I guarantee you that you'll see endless posts about how the game is bad and broken and the devs are idiots and I'm gonna stop playing so on so forth. That is unless you go to a sub that actually actively moderates against complaints and seeks to be a place of positivity (lowsodiumdestiny for example).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut of course it's not true that players hate the games they play. It's not true that they even have nearly as many complaints as these communities would lead you to believe. It's just that these online spaces, invariable, becomes cesspools of complaint. The negativity eventually drives out people who want to participate positively, only concentrating and further driving negativity.\n\nBut what can be done about it? How can positive gaming communities be cultivated and sustained. How do you created an ecosystem of gaming communities where a casual perusal of them would give an outsider the impression this game is loved rather begrudgingly accepted to outright hated by the people that play it?\n\nIt honestly drives me nuts. It's gotten to the point that anytime I like a game now, I know to just avoid the community, cause no matter how much I like it, if I seek out a community of others to discuss this thing I love, that's not what I'm gonna find. I'm gonna find a ton of people telling me all of the reasons the thing I like is bad actually and is garbage.",

Gaming-focused groups become negative because gaming-focused people are negative. Communities that center around individual expression and creativity tend to be more positive. Don\u2019t like a TTRPG? Making your own rules / story is pretty standard behavior and easy. Don\u2019t like a videogame? Whining and complaining in hopes that they listen to your feedback in the sequel is your best recourse, short of making your own game (a daunting task requiring knowledge of multiple disciplines)",

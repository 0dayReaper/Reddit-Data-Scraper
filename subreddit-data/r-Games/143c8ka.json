                    "comment": "I just finished it last night. Game play is above average, although it's weird and annoying how there's random mini bosses than require melee fighting over firearms when most of the game is firearm based.\n\nThe open world concept was dumb as shit. The vast majority of the game is linear which is great and then you have to deal with this open world of non-stop spawning enemies and annoying cameras. I found it was easier to just run/drive directly past everything and ignore everything that's in the open world parts.\n\nThe main character seems like he was written by a completely different group of people that had no idea what the actual game was about. Honestly might be the worst written character I've ever come across. Like a really bad attempt at making a Duke Nukem type.\n\nI personally liked the world building, lore, and the story was decent, if not pretty good. They've created a great world that hopefully gets other games in it. Level design and enemy design are above average, but enemies could have used more variety. \n\nIf the game gets a sequel and the drop the open world and write a decent main character I'd be pretty hyped for it, just to get more lore and more of the world they built.",

I typically take it with a grain of salt when people complain about it in other games: for example, I found Watch Dogs 2 fine which I think gets a lot of unfair flak.\n\nBut my god. I only got about 2 or 3 hours into the game and I had to uninstall it. He is such a jackass to 95% of the people and his A.I., and then is an insatiable bootlicker to his employer and handful of other stuff. And the dude is so emotionally erratic. Hed ask his ai a question, and then immediately berate it for answering. Like holy shit. He is painfully unfunny in the vein of thinking that insults are the pinnacle of comedy, and has literally nothing to compensate for it: the game introduced nothing to make you empathize with him, nor gave you any reason to understand his perspective. He was just a constant shroud of negativity, and the game would have been miles better if it was another silent protagonist.",

And yeah, I *know* they try to justify it with a computer entry towards the end, but its the *dumbest* explanation and still relies on an actual human being saying the phrase at some point.",

I thought there was potential in both sections, but the world is way less interesting than it lets on. \n\nIt could be an enjoyable enough linear shooter, and I might go back and approach it like that some day, but it's definitely not for the slow-goers like me that explore every inch before moving on.",

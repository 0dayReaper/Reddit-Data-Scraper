That said as DF puts it Spiderman 2 is more of an iteration on the last gen Spiderman than a big next gen showcase. There are some lookers out now like Cyberpunk Overdrive, Fortnite UE5 and Horizon Forbidden West but this game is not striving for such heights.",

But Spiderman also has to move through a super dense and varied city which is far more demanding to do than the Horizon or fortnite open fields of rocks and trees. \n\nI'd rather the game not try to be so demanding we end up with 1080p 30fps and instead make it look really good with options for 60fps on console.",

People with 1080p monitors get similar performance on lower end cards.\n\nThat is still well out of reach for either of the current gen consoles, however. The 3080 is outright faster, and Nvidia's ray tracing is still a generation ahead of AMD.",

This experience on a 3050 still looks good but most importantly runs good despite the anemic hardware. Higher end hardware doesn't need the mod but can of course benefit from it.",

They don't have to be exclusive to the platform for you to get value out of them. You bought a piece of hardware and it plays video games.\n\n&gt; after we spent $600 on it\n\nThe PS5 has been $400 or $500 since launch depending on whether you get it with a disc drive. If you're going to write an angry rant about how PS5 games coming to PC a year later somehow hurts you, at least get your facts straight.\n\n&gt; It\u2019s that with the ports, there is ZERO reason to upgrade your PlayStation.\n\nLast I checked, not everybody has, wants, or can afford a gaming PC. If you hadn't noticed, the PS5 is breaking sales records. Clearly people other than you see value in it. If you don't, then you always have the option of *not* buying one.\n\n&gt; And that\u2019s a problem for PlayStation owners.\n\n*How*, exactly, is it a problem for PlayStation owners?\n\nWhat Sony and the rest of the market have realized, but apparently you haven't, is that PC doesn't really compete with consoles. PC gamers aren't going to abandon their platform for a few shiny exclusives the way an Xbox 360 player might have switched over to the PS4.\n\nYou are literally whining that PC users get to enjoy some of the same games as you, with a delayed release schedule and variable port quality to boot. This might be the most entitled opinion I've seen on Reddit all month.",

Otherwise, it's near-identical to the first game. And the benefits are no-brainers: yes, the current-gen exclusive game that reuses the original map from the last-gen title (with added locales) will feature better textures and a more populated environment. \n\nThe game will look fantastic because the first looked fantastic but it isn't being a 'sour grape' to acknowledge that it isn't at all the kind of upgrade that would be expected of the new hardware. It's completely iterative and even upgrades like the water rendering match the fidelity of GTA V -- which, yes, had fantastic water rendering *in 2013*.\n\nI can completely understand not pursuing a graphical showcase if they use their resources instead to improve the gameplay, but that's yet to really be seen. Still optimistic, though.",

And stuff like Miles Morales, a new story with unique gameplay and scenarios but using a lot of assets from the previous game, which can be sold for a reduced price but also cost wayyyy less to make than a new game from scratch",

I guess with Unreals MetaHumans it would could give generic NPCs main character quality models. \n\nAs for dynamism of peds and more city simulation - I sort of think of that apart from graphics.\n\nLike if Spider-Man 2 can look as good as it does. But had Full Ray Tracing, no low quality models, a city simulation with full time of day, weather, destruction simulation and interiors. But the sim models and interiors would be hard to do and provide little return unless procedural generated or whatever",

Spider-Man isn't really known as an aquatic superhero.\n\n\nSure, some of the interactions don't look perfect (such as some of the splashes looked a bit wonky, and Miles interacting with the water when he came up to the surface wasn't amazing) but I was too busy looking at everything else to just sort of tune it out.\n\n\nAlso this is an Insomniac, and they typically push out graphic upgrades between showing their games and the game releasing (unlike some developers) so I expect they will make improvements.\n\n\nI dunno.

As long as it is priced sensibly I\u2019d love to see more developers do these \u2018half sequels\u2019 as it can be turned around so much quicker. Personally I\u2019m bored with the 5 year plus wait for a new instalment in a franchise. I\u2019d happily pay for less ambitious smaller entries.",

This game is a perfect example of a sequel a new story with gameplay that innovates and builds on what the previous game was. Literally the only reason your upset is because of some absurd expectation this game would be more advanced than anything we've seen before which is just unreasonable.",

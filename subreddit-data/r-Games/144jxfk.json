Knowing that this game uses Kiryu and ties into Yakuza 7 and 8 makes me kinda sad.\n\nThat's not to say that I'm gonna hate this game. I love everything RGG Studios puts out and I already pre-ordered it and know I'm gonna love it. Just wish it had a new MC.",

Because I watched the reveal stream and they said quite the opposite, that they initially wanted to just focus on Ichiban, but in the process of development, the story they wrote made it impossible for Kiryu not to have a major role. So they made the decision to make them co-leads and also decided to make Gaiden/Man Who Erased His Name to set up Kiryu's role in LaD8. They said nothing about it being solely Ichiban's story and Kiryu being a cameo or whatever. The only thing they referenced about doing differently in the trailer is that they said Kiryu's silver-haired design wasn't final and they may change that from trailer to the final game.",

In-game he works very well when you're playing as Wright because you know Gumshoe means well, and has a good heart (so he's not deliberately antagonistic or anything), he's just incredibly inept at his job and makes your life difficult for it. He has made plenty of wrongful arrests and has inadvertently gotten many innocent people in jail due to the AA world's near-100% conviction rate, and never even questioned any of it until Wright points out his logic mistakes in the trials. \n\nNothing against Gumshoe, he's a great character, but let's just say there's a reason why they made Edgeworth the MC of the Investigation games rather than him.",

On one hand, if you have him suddenly develop into a competent detective after being (deservedly) the butt of a joke for years, then that wouldn't be true to his character, so why not just use someone else? And on the other hand, if you put him in a situation where the case is so simple that even Gumshoe (the guy whose MO is to arrest the first person he sees at any given crime scene) can solve it, then that wouldn't be a very interesting case. \n\nI get the idea of \"growth\" but it's not a realistic one for Gumshoe. Wright started off as a rookie lawyer who had the smarts and the heart, just not the experience and confidence, and then grew into a mentor figure upon acquiring them with years' worth of work. Gumshoe started off as a terrible detective all the way back in AA1 and has only gotten dumber with each subsequent game, so him suddenly becoming competent over the course of just one case isn't realistic.\n\nAm I saying that there is literally no way to make this story work? No, you could probably pull off such a stretch that you can justify it... But at this point, why bother? If you're gonna make \"Yakuza in the Ace Attorney universe\" there are a lot more compelling characters you can place in the lead than Gumshoe. I just straight up don't get the appeal of him being a protagonist.",

They did a whole game trying to make people like Ichiban and then Kiryu shows up for 10 minutes and everyone instantly wishes he was playable again instead lol",

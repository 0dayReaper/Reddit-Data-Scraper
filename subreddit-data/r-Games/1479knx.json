The only FF games that have been met with critical acclaim have been the MMO, and most RPG players write FF14 off because they don't imagine it has a good story (even tho I personally think it has the BEST story in the entire franchise).\n\nA lot of people aren't convinced that FF16 will be able to succeed where 15 and 13 failed in gameplay and in story. The general audience isn't familiar with CBU3's work on FF14, and so they have no reason to be excited for the quality at which they put out games.\n\nI think high reviews and word of mouth are the two big things that'll draw attention to this.",

JRPGs are having a renaissance now and there are a lot of great games released over the years with huge numbers sold. But they also have smaller budgets. Persona, Dragon Quest, Xenoblade, Trails, Tales of. They all showed very well relative to their cost. With how ridiculously expensive FF is becoming and the unrealistic sales expectations put upon it, no wonder Square Enix themselves don't have confidence in 16.",

If FF XVI is balls to the wall amazing it will sell like hotcakes because the brand is very strong, but it's not evocative of what people think about Final Fantasy so it doesn't generate the hype the VII remake did (which has somewhat dissipated it feels like).",

FFXV was open-world, unlike previous titles, but had the concept of driving around everywhere in a Rolls Royce that was unique and intriguing. Those road trip memes weren't just jokes but expressions of hype and interest.\n\nFFXVI, meanwhile, has taken a lot of inspiration from other things (Game of Thrones, God of War and Devil May Cry among other things admitted by the developers) and at least insofar as trailers go, doesn't seem have introduced any particular revolutionary twist to the mix.\n\nIt is possible the trailers just didn't show it off and there are big innovative twists that people will only discover when they play for real.\n\nBut as it stands, we only have what's been shown so far. Most of the hype has come from the superstar reputation of the development team and the quality shown of the existing mechanics. Based on that, we have a game that could very well end up a top-tier take on the stuff they were inspired by, well-received and highly engaging. But not groundbreaking in the way people may attribute to the Final Fantasy brand.",

I see someone who likes what's been shown of FF16's protagonist so far and has played the entire series enough that a statement like that feels right for them personally. \n\nWould love to hear about your favorite FF protagonist and be reminded about all the great characters the franchise has had so far. Or you can tell us more about the \"gotcha\" you apparently made lol.",

The person you replied to in the first place wrote \"Clive *could end up as* the greatest\" not \"Clive *is* the greatest.\" It's a comment about **potential**, not actuality.\n\nYet, in this very comment I'm replying to, you appear to have been laboring under that very misconception!\n\n&gt; Saying a protag in an almost 40 year ling running series *is* the greatest [Emphasis mine]\n\nPointing out that a character's got a lot of potential isn't a declarative statement of that potential being actualized, so maybe your comment was a bit unwarranted?",

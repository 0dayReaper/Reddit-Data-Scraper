Lisa the Painful is one of my favorite games ever, can't believe we're getting more content after all this time. \n\nBrad and Buddy's stories feel pretty complete though so no idea what a new game would be about, but I'm hyped anyways.",

Then, it got delayed, and it\u2019s been pretty much radio silence ever since. He also had a game called \u201cNinja Tears\u201d that he was working on - I wonder if that project ended up turning into this? I wonder if it\u2019s still an RPGMaker game? Super excited to see what he he\u2019s been cooking up.",

While people who played LISA loved it, it didn't make that big of a splash in the gaming world, and was largely overshadowed by its similarly inspired contemporary, Undertale. It could be because it was uglier, edgier, and more abrasive in its humor and darker themes, but I don't believe it ever got the recognition it truly deserved. I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.",

    "postText": "We're going to remove the payment feature from the Skyrim workshop. For anyone who spent money on a mod, we'll be refunding you the complete amount. We talked to the team at Bethesda and they agree.\n\nWe've done this because it's clear we didn't understand exactly what we were doing. We've been shipping many features over the years aimed at allowing community creators to receive a share of the rewards, and in the past, they've been received well. It's obvious now that this case is different. \n \nTo help you understand why we thought this was a good idea, our main goals were to allow mod makers the opportunity to work on their mods full time if they wanted to, and to encourage developers to provide better support to their mod communities. We thought this would result in better mods for everyone, both free &amp; paid. We wanted more great mods becoming great products, like Dota, Counter-strike, DayZ, and Killing Floor, and we wanted that to happen organically for any mod maker who wanted to take a shot at it.\n\nBut we underestimated the differences between our previously successful revenue sharing models, and the addition of paid mods to Skyrim's workshop. We understand our own game's communities pretty well, but stepping into an established, years old modding community in Skyrim was probably not the right place to start iterating. We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly, even though we believe there's a useful feature somewhere here.\n\nNow that you've backed a dump truck of feedback onto our inboxes, we'll be chewing through that, but if you have any further thoughts let us know.\n\n",

They needed to start somewhere, so they picked a company with games that are pretty extensively modded. Skyrim is the most recent Bethesda game that lends itself to modding in a big way - you don't see Dishonored or The Evil Within getting much mod treatment.  Also, those are just Bethesda published, which opens up a whole different can of worms; it's likely much easier for Bethesda to deal with their own dev team, which means Skyrim.\n\nI see what they were going for. If it was going to work, it needed to be a company they knew was supportive of modding (and I'd argue Bethesda does this better than anyone), who was on board with the idea, and also had the legal right to do something like that without getting into quibbles with id, Tango or MachineGames.",

The modding community was already deeply established with the general spirit being that assets are more or less communal with work being shared and built-on by different people. Monetizing the modding community in this way directly contradicted the spirit that a significant (possibly majority) amount of modders were in when they joined. \n\nThe complexity of the mods and the work involved in Skyrim is also a completely different beast than the ones Valve has successfully handled (CS:GO, TF2, DotA2) which amounted to cosmetic changes that can work as a standalone mod. Contrast it to the dependencies between mods that developed in the Skyrim community, it's clear that the same model would never have worked.\n\nIf this system was going to work, it would have to be in place at the very beginning of the game's product life, not years after the fact. Because it's too late to untangle the legal quagmire of copyright and ownership of mods now without completely scrapping the work of most mods.",

Maybe not 100%, given I'm sure they had access to the source code to make some changes, but they could have done it.\n\nWhich, brings me to the kicker. 25% of the gross *would be far, far more than Obsidian actually received for making NV*.\n\n",

Kudos from their peers and people who use their mods, working with others, and probably to a large extent just the feeling of having worked on something and creating a product.\n\nI think it's fairly obvious that it is these motivations that give way to the fact that modding is so great.

The unintended consequences is the splitting of a community which has always been non-profit and a potential flooding of the market with cheap and low quality mods (imagine the mod workshop turning into something like the android app store).\n\nSo what incentive could work for modders ? Well that is the million dollar question right now. Donations don't work well because people never use them (it's like buying winrar). I think more brainstorming should be done on this subject by all parties involved and not a unilateral move by steam/bethesda on the community workshop.",

So they can eat and pay rent.\n\n&gt; Donations don't work well because people never use them\n\n**Never** is too strong; Doom was distributed initially as shareware, and was *so* popular that Id made lots of money on \"donations.\" \n\nBut that's the key: You have to be spectacularly successful in order to make that much money off of donations. The numbers just can't be there for mods for a game: Even a substantial fraction of most games' user bases wouldn't be enough downloads to make it into the millions of units necessary for donations to pay off.\n\nI think the community was being selfish and short-sighted in their knee-jerk reaction against paid mods. There's a sense of entitlement that forms around a product once you've received it for free, and people will go nuts if they later have to pay for it, even if the product *is* worth real value to them.\n\n*But* there may be a better way: A lot of cartoonists are making a lot of money on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) these days. Could famous modders give early access and/or extra free mods to supporters? Or even offer to produce *more* mods if they end up hitting a high enough income threshold? \n\nPatreon side-steps the entitlement issue, psychologically, and so might work better. Never know, though.",

Give the customer the ability to pay for mods. Allow them to set the slider all the way down. Take 5%, and give 10% to the game developer, similar to the marketplace tax. Give the rest to the modder, maybe give the option to donate to a charity but don't force the modder to do this. Happy faces all around. ",

This passion has produced some outstanding works. People can produce great quality stuff without being paid for it. Being paid for it corrupts the purity of this sort of creativity.\n\nDemanding money for it also causes a massive legal headache and it blurs the line between DLC an who is working for the company or who isn't.

Right now, people make mods because they just want to create something for a game that they love. I was massively into the Quake modding scene at one point, and made mods purely because I enjoyed it. Putting money in there somewhere just tempts the kind of companies who flood the Play store with crap, and suddenly the workshop would be filled with enough desperate cash grabbers to completely drown out those who are making mods for the enjoyment.\n\nThe end result would be modders being unable to compete with the small teams put together purely to milk the market. Those modders would eventually just give up, and almost completely hand the ball over to those companies.\n\nThe biggest issue is, the Play store wouldn't be littered with crap if there weren't enough idiots spending money on it in the first place.

Cut is based off the tier you're in, etc etc.\n\nThere's options, it's all about choosing the right one. ",

A mod isn't a hat, a good mod will take upwards of 1000 hours in the making. Some mods are as big as an entire DLC, but those mods are done by very few people, over very long times. \n\nBecause of this, it basically encourages modder to release short term, low time investment mods (SEE: HATS, WEAPONS), and nothing else. Nobody is gonna drop their work to make Skyrim mods full time, because the amount of time it requires vs the amount of money it would require is impossible to meet. Faalskar took 2000 hours from a single guy, with the free help of many, many people. Eliminate that free help ('cause now you're charging, people gotta get paid), we can be looking at 2500 hours. Let's take a wage of 10$ an hour, so to make up for that, you'd need to make 25k. So that means you must sell for 1,000,00$ of your mod to make up for the time you invested@ 10$ each, that's 10k sales, and we're talking about one the most efficiently made and high quality mod, done by an actual programmer. That's nearly impossible.",

I'm not against paid mods but first I think you guys at Valve have to do a *much* better job of policing things.\n\nShow us that you can better work out the problems in Early Access and Greenlight and then lets talk. It takes a big man (or company) to admit faults, and I do appreciate you guys taking a step back.\n\nThank you from a nolifer /w ~1500 hours played in Skyrim.",

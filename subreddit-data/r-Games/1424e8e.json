Less than stellar ports or disappointing games), so people are a bit more pissed off in general at any issue.\n\nI'm going to get it for PS5 bc I know my pc won't be able to run it (it wasn't a great build in 2019 either, but my budget wasn't huge and I had to buy all the peripherals as well). \n\nI'm waiting until all DLCs are out since Team Ninjas games are a bit more mechanically complex and ramp up difficulty with DLCs, so being rusty with each release wouldn't help... So I can't give a personal perspective on the issue, but yeah, that's my educated guess as to why it seems like people are angrier than with their previous other games.",

Instead it seems they're treating them the same way they do their Youtube content creators - with the bare minimum or nonexistant support.\n\nI can't say it's off-brand for Google, but it sure does look like a hilariously stupid thing to do when they're floundering while trying to break into a new industry.",

I know Re-Logic isn't an AAA studio, but you'd think the devs of a game that has sold over 30 million copies and is still regularly amongst the top games on Steam after nearly a decade would be someone with a similar level of clout to that.",

They already cancelled their in-house productions and it will probably only be a matter of time until they cease all development on the platform. It was a good idea, but average consumer tech just isn't there. Maybe try again in 20 years.",

It's why services like PS Now and xCloud are doing well, and even GFN is doing alright despite publishers hating its guts and restricting everything from being on it. At least when Stadia dies, maybe they'll embrace it more?",

Long term support at Google is almost always an afterthought.\n\nAgain, take this with a grain of salt since I can't find my source, but this alleged mentality does track with...well, a lot of Google's behavior honestly :/",

What's worse is that a delisting from Google means that even customers who already paid for a game can't redownload it anymore, so you have to hope that the dev is generous enough to give away their game for free once they've created a new listing for the game. I've never heard of any other digital storefront for games doing anything like that.\n\nI'm already one of the few people willing to pay a premium for mobile games in order to escape the F2P hell that is so common on that side of gaming, but Google is making it really difficult to justify any purchase.\n\nIt would be pretty neat if more devs would distribute their games DRM free on alternate channels like Humble or itch.",

They're probably as pissed as anyone that someone somewhere in a completely unrelated department to Stadia is causing Stadia to lose big games like Terraria. They're probably as out of the loop as us and I can imagine top people at Stadia themselves trying to get responses from \"Google\" and are getting fobbed off like the rest of us. The Stadia team are probably the only ones to be talking to the Terraria devs but since its to do with a Google account they don't get to decide if it gets unblocked or not so I'm not gonna laugh at them. I don't know the full story though but it seems dumb to assign blame to them.\n\nGoogle just needs sorting out. Especially when it comes to big accounts. You'd think an account responsible for a million sales on your platform getting banned would immediately flag up somewhere for an immediate review right away and solved within hours, but nope. I got one of my apps banned once and it took 3 weeks to not only get a reply but also manually reviewed and unbanned, but that was years ago. I thought Google had business accounts that got quick replies and even phone support? Devs should get those accounts.",

I get it was a new service, but when they advertised streaming being as easy as pressing a button and there'd be a stream available on YouTube immediately, and that multiple features *required* that stream to be active, then I expected that to be a feature at launch. Instead, the only way to stream was to either have a PC with streaming capabilities, or buy a capture card. \n\nI got replies saying those features are coming, they were available for \"insert game here\", and told to just buy a capture card if I wanted to stream so bad. The point was that I shouldn't have to buy anything. It was an advertised feature that still wasn't available after 6 months, with zero official communication on when it would come. \n\nThen there's all the shit with the friend pass, latency issues, and they're still missing some major publisher support (as well as losing their own studios recently).

I used it when I was in the US and it was _okay_, but I had to move to Japan unexpectedly for family reasons and it simply just doesn't work.  Even if you try to get around it with a VPN in a supported country, there's a lag check and it won't let you play if your latency is too high (which it certainly is from Japan).  Evidently they are working on launching in Japan (I no longer get messages about the game not being available in my country, but the games fail to launch due to the lag check), but at this point, I'm not really interested any more.  Google's communication is absolutely terrible and I question their long term commitment to Stadia.",

I had set a recovery email, but it's not being asked anywhere in the account recovery process and ends up being useless. \n\nGoogle support's answer? Post in the community forums, and get the response that there's only one recovery procedure (the one I was already following), and if that doesn't work **TO MAKE A NEW GOOGLE ACCOUNT**! Throw everything you had under that account to the wind, it's gone now, nothing we can do!\n\nContrast to, for example, Microsoft where you can get in touch with *actual* support personnel who will work with you and get you access again. \n\nI don't understand how Google doesn't pay more attention to stuff like this, just blows my mind.",

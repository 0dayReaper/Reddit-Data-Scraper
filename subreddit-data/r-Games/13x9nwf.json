Unfortunately, an intriguing world and likable characters are not enough to make this a great experience. While it may appeal to some, JRPG fans looking for a unique challenge may want to look elsewhere.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Generaci\u00f3n Xbox](https://opencritic.com/outlet/431/generaci-n-xbox)** - [Alejandro Serrador](https://opencritic.com/critic/8155/alejandro-serrador) - *Spanish* - [78 / 100](https://generacionxbox.com/analisis-de-loop8-summer-of-gods/)\n\n&gt;In a rural environment, in the heart of the universe, inconsequentiality, existential emptiness, lack of values, deep dissatisfaction reign... On the edge of the most absolute abyss, without any direction or anchorage that gives us security, Loop8: Summer of Gods invites us, in the old way, to face that looped piece that deals with the destruction and reconstruction of things. In this regard, slowing down its execution to get out of it, without additional iterations.\n\n-------------\n\n**[LadiesGamers.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/734/ladiesgamers-com)** - [Yvonne van Geloven](https://opencritic.com/critic/6785/yvonne-van-geloven) - [Liked](https://ladiesgamers.com/loop8-summer-of-gods-review/)\n\n&gt;Playing Loop8: Summer of Gods, I debated about which rating to give. Often I know even from the start which way my verdict will go, but not so this time. At first, the town felt so barren, and I often felt like I was just clicking away. Suggesting as much as I could towards everyone I met. Eventually, I began to see how I should play the game, paying more attention to relationships and whose friendship I wanted the most. Plus, I did my best to max my stats with activities.\n&gt;\n&gt;I liked the battles; I would have loved more of them, not just on the days that the gate to the underworld was open. But what made me keep on doubting my verdict was the feeling of being an outsider. Sure, I tried to get closer to my classmates by making the right suggestions, but I would have loved more real background stories and feeling. When I suggest \u201cGet to know better\u201d, I really want to know the person!\n&gt;\n&gt;I am going for I Like It, as I feel Loop8: Summer of Gods has more potential. To get the A Lot added to the I Like It, I would have needed more fleshed-out characters to relate to, making forming an emotional bond less a matter of clicking away and more of really wanting to know them more!\n\n-------------\n\n**[Niche Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/298/niche-gamer)** - [Matt Kowalski](https://opencritic.com/critic/2237/matt-kowalski) - [8.5 / 10](https://nichegamer.com/reviews/loop-8-summer-of-gods-review/)\n\n&gt;Loop 8: Summer of Gods is an enjoyable game but it is not for everyone. If you are a fan of strong narratives, then we\u2019d recommend picking it up. If you are a fan of traditional JRPGs then it might be better to watch some gameplay first. If you don\u2019t like a challenge or repetitive gameplay, then we suggest avoiding it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [George Yang](https://opencritic.com/critic/7294/george-yang) - [5 / 10](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/loop8-summer-of-gods)\n\n&gt;While Loop8's story has the potential to be incredibly interesting, it never really lands and fails to leave an emotional impact towards the end. It's all presented beautifully and has a unique mix of gameplay styles and ideas, but their repetitive and frustrating nature makes the whole experience a chore. It's like toiling away at your summer job and going through the motions until it's time to leave.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NookGaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/768/nookgaming)** - [Thomas Knight](https://opencritic.com/critic/7286/thomas-knight) - [5 / 10](https://www.nookgaming.com/loop8-summer-of-gods-review/)\n\n&gt;Loop8: Summer of Gods has an interesting concept and some great characters that give a good reason to play it. My first impressions were actually quite positive and if my review was based on the first ten hours, it would probably be a 7/10 due to the great character moments and idea of growing stronger through loops. Unfortunately, the issues with gameplay and systems that came to light over the full forty-five hours it took to complete, and the method of storytelling make it difficult to outright recommend.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Jenny Jones](https://opencritic.com/critic/3679/jenny-jones) - [5 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/loop8-summer-of-gods)\n\n&gt;A good time loop mechanic is supposed to give you enough variety so that repetition doesn't set in. Unfortunately, this is where Loop8 falls flat. You\u2019ll be going over the same conversations and they\u2019re just not interesting enough to make it worthwhile. It also doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s only a small variety of enemies, and that the underworld is mostly just the town with a different colour palette. It's hard not to get annoyed when you realise that you\u2019re still not strong enough to take out the next boss, and have no choice but to repeat the last few weeks.\n\n-------------\n\n**[RPG Site](https://opencritic.com/outlet/322/rpg-site)** - [Cullen Black](https://opencritic.com/critic/6444/cullen-black) - [4 / 10](https://www.rpgsite.net/review/14284-loop8-summer-of-gods-review)\n\n&gt;Loop8 is a game full of great ideas that never comes together.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions)** - [Scott Adams](https://opencritic.com/critic/8755/scott-adams) - [3.5 / 5 ](https://www.theouterhaven.net/2023/05/loop8-summer-of-gods-review-looks-like-my-summer-vacation-is-over/)\n\n&gt;Loop8: Summer of Gods has a very interesting premise with stunning visuals and amazing music. The creativity in the game can hold back other parts of the mechanics.\n\n-------------",

            "comment": "&gt; As for the aforementioned roguelike elements in Loop8, that term should be applied very loosely. The game is only a roguelike in the sense that when Nini and his party gets wiped out, the timeline automatically resets and he goes all the way back to the beginning of August. This isn\u2019t the type of roguelike that you can knock out a run in about 30-60 minutes. Each loop takes about 8-10 hours simply because of all the conversations you have to repeat again with the characters because their stats reset after every loop.\n\nI am sorry but this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a JRPG.\n\nPlaying Final Fantasy 7 without a memory card does not make it a roguelike, yet this is exactly how this game sounds like.",

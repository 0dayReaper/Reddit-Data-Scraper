Study-level usually means *everything* is simulated down to each individual electric breaker. No inoperative buttons in the game, etc. They take a lot of time to make and often don't get ported to newer sims or versions. In MSFS there's only a few aircraft I would call properly simulated and they're usually boring ass airliners. I have a study-level TBM-850 (by Hot-Start, but I suggest avoiding these guys as their DRM scheme is INSANE for a fucking video game add-on, and uses your hardware address for up to 3 activations only) in X-Plane that I absolutely love and it makes the TBM-900 in MSFS2020 look like a children's toy.\n\nMSFS is *beautiful* but from a flight mechanics simulation standpoint it leaves a lot to be desired. There are certain things it's not very good at accurately simulating. Shit they didn't even release the game with a helicopter, and third-party helis leave a lot to be desired. X-Plane handles them quite well but not as well as DCS does.",

Learning all the hard stuff while selling it off as a premium game/product is a pretty good deal, especially if they can translate that technology into other stuff as well. Imagine having that level of accuracy/detail with a google-maps-esque directions thing, where you can literally \"walk\" around and see where to park and such. Or that level of detail for some dude doing maintenance on a transfer station in the middle of nowhere so they can find exactly where it is. Just seems as you said that technology was/is the main focus, and I'd imagine it'll be seen in many other use cases eventually.",

I don't trust trailers, and I'm skeptical that this is going to be as good as they make it look. I bet it's just scenarios, but I hope I'm wrong, and it might add the functionality to the game for much more detailed mods to be made. \n\nWeather is extremely hard to get right (at least real-world weather) because so many places in the U.S. and especially around the world don't have very good Wx information networks and weather models only help so much.",

From what I understand, it takes a small team a year plus for even a 'basic' WWII era aircraft, let alone something more complicated and recent like a 747 or god forbid military jet. Can't imagine how much work goes into tracing everything back to how it works and translating that into the games code.\n\nHas Microsoft said anything about modding for MSFS? As you said, the quality of the engine/game itself and aircraft heavily dictate who plays the game and how. X-Plane has some amazingly accurate aircraft, it'd be awesome to see that level of accuracy/detail in MSFS with its graphics and new potential with the updated/more efficient engine (hopefully?).",

You can spend THOUSANDS in MSFS 2020 on first and third party DLC and if none of that works in MSFS24 than it's a massive fuck you to everyone who plays.\n\n**EDIT** FAQ Just went live https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-faq/\n\n**Will Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 be a completely standalone sequel, or will it also be offered as a paid update for existing players?** \n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator 2024 is a standalone simulator and the next-generation sequel to Microsoft Flight Simulator that launched in 2020. Current aircraft and airports that are in Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020), as well as virtually all Marketplace add-ons, will be supported in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.\n\n**What kind of support can Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) players expect to see once Flight Simulator 2024 has been released?**\n\nWe will continue to deliver our Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) Roadmap which has content ranging from Aircraft and Avionics Updates, Sim Updates, City and World Updates, and also the free Dune DLC. We will continue to support Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) post the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launch.\n\n**Will all purchases users have made from the Marketplace be transferrable to the new simulator?**\n\nWith very few exceptions, virtually all add-ons that work in Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) today will function in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Add-ons that were purchased from the in-simulator Marketplace will not need to be re-purchased in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nSo new game you'll have to buy (or game pass), no surprise there, but sounds like all first party content will be right there in MSFS24 and almost all third party ones. My guess would be either updates or licensing issues may restrict some of them. And virtually all purchased add-ons in game will work in MSFS 2024.\n\nVery glad they made this FAQ to clear things up. Still a little annoyed they made a whole new game instead of just updating the existing one, would love to find out why they did that instead of just releasing the new content as a paid expansion. But the most important thing, basically all of our purchased content will move forward to 24.",

Their response was piracy was a major problem with add-on aircraft and they would never change their policy or DRM scheme. All I did was swap a hard drive out and I had to contact support to re-validate. Absolutely insane.",

Over the years I have a setup that's several hundred dollars in investments, but it's not needed to get started and have fun. And for MSFS especially, you don't need the super precise inputs on a joystick that you need for the combat flight sims, i.e. refueling from a tanker.",

There was actually some (paid IIRC) mods for older Flight Simulator games doing exactly that, sorta. Not that detailed and automated, but kept track of stuff like fuel, cargo, money, etc, was really cool. Especially if you combine their already really accessible mechanics and beautiful graphics, something like that would really stand out and probably draw a decent chunk of new people in (relatively speaking for the niche community flying/sim is of course). This is pretty much up that alley and what the sim community have been begging for since I was playing '95.

Newer engines that make full use of newer hardware, switching from DirextX 11 to DX12, more experienced developers, and optimisation over time can make newer / better looking games run faster than the old ones.\n\nSometimes due to deadlines, devs release a game with less than ideal performance, which can also then be improved in the next game.\n\nThe biggest example that springs to mind is Assassin's Creed Origins, which had disastrous CPU support and lags on computers to this day. AC Odyssee and AC Valhalla that released 3-6 years later perform much better than Origins on the same hardware.\n\nSame with Doom Eternal, which runs better than Doom 2016 in a lot of cases, while also looking better and having things like ray tracing added.\n\nCounter Strike 2 runs better than CSGO, since CSGO runs on the outdated Source 1 engine, while CS2 has moved to Source 2, and is much more optimised for hardware.",

Once I got my pc up and running I installed it from Game Pass, marveled at the shine of the game, then within a few hours was grating against how slow it felt to move to a new starting point, how irritatingly chatty ATC was, how I could never seem to get the autopilot to actually follow the course so I could enjoy the view. One of my minor annoyances was the lack of time line options, I wanted to do a flyover of Mt St Helens during the 1980 eruption.\n\nAnd that doesn't even begin to describe my displeasure at the third-party aircraft system. $70 to fly a 737? For EACH model of 737?\n\nI miss FS2000...",

And I've never experienced any problems with auto-pilots, there are a couple planes in the game with autopilots that are older and don't do what you might want them to. I suggest the Working Title G1000 mod which greatly improves realism in glass cockpit planes. \n\nI would never expect historical imagery in the game due to the extremely spotty nature of it, the fact much of it is in black and white... I can see a lot of complications.\n\nAlso those $70 737 while not study-level are extremely detailed. But... let me tell you a secret, there's no DRM on any of the aircraft or scenery.

And yes, I get that for people going full sim, you've got a bunch of stuff to monitor and tweak and all that, but for people who don't play that way, there's the whole takeoff process if you want to start that from complete scratch, there's landing and possible taxi-ing all the way to a proper finish... and there's little else.  This is the kind of thing that I wished these games had for the longest time.  Objectives of some description.  It's nice to see that at long last and I can see myself spending a lot more time in MS Flight Sim because of it.",

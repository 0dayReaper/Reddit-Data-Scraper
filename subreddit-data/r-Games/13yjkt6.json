            "comment": "I think this is actually the most important part of the article, not the headlining content:\n\n&gt;Nintendo seems to be attempting to brand Dolphin an \u201cillegal emulator,\u201d by the way. Nintendo spokesperson Eddie Garcia provided this statement to The Verge:\n\n&gt; &gt;Nintendo is committed to protecting the hard work and creativity of video game engineers and developers. This emulator illegally circumvents Nintendo\u2019s protection measures and runs illegal copies of games. Using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms development and ultimately stifles innovation. Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of other companies, and in turn expects others to do the same.\n\nThe cryptographic key inclusion hasn't been explicitly found to be illegal but Nintendo's official spokesperson is referring to it that way already, in a statement that was almost certainly reviewed by Nintendo's legal team. This could just be bluster but it could also be some groundwork we're seeing laid.",

Its come to court and found to be legal. The illegal aspect comes with ROM hosting.)",

So if you want to modify the console you bought that is illegal unless you got permission from the company (i.e. Sony or Nintendo). So effectively save modifications, ripping AND selling ROMS, adding modifications to your console that is not approved (i.e. physical cosmetics are fine but changing the wiring or installing a mod chip is a big no).",

They don't make money from the second hand market, but they want to be able to release a game as a remaster, remake or just as an emulated title. They don't know when they will but they want the option to. They feel like ROMS undermine that.\n\nMaybe they don't have a plan to release Pok\u00e9mon Yellow now. But maybe in a year or two they will. Don't want to undermind that market, no matter how fair or unfair you may think it is.",

Being in an interracial relationship was illegal, as was being gay, and in some places *right now* in the US they're trying to make it illegal to wear clothing they disapprove of. Legality is a shit-tier basis for what is right or wrong.",

While emulators themselves aren't illegal, under the DMCA decrypting roms is, which you in most cases have to do in order to be able to emulate them in the first place. And yes, that includes roms you've dumped yourself. So you could probably make a case that the actual process of emulating a game isn't as legal as most people think it is.",

See - limited run of the 3 classic Mario game collection. Why not make it always available?? So many people wanted Mario Sunshine + Galaxy on modern consoles and they did that for whatever reason\n\nWhy do we still not have stuff like Wind Waker on the Switch? When the E-Shop closed on DS why not just offer a huge 50-80% sale on everything instead of letting it all die? Old games, especially Pok\u00e9mon ones, regularly sell for over $100 even with no box. If they sold them off at $20 each in the last month of the e shops life they'd make bank\n\nOld games becoming abandonware is inevitable really, but no one does it quite like Nintendo, even for stuff that is less than 10 years old",

This was put through the wringer more than a decade ago with the DVD key scandal, and as far as I know nobody was ever successfully sued despite the fact that the copyright industry had a rather large and extremely pressing motive to take people to court and sue the everloving crap out of them\n\nNintendo takes the view that all emulation is illegal, so they draw no real distinction between the two. They've always aggressively shut down emulators\n\nMultiple sites including wikipedia publish encryption keys which would trivially fall under nintendos definition of being illegal, including\n\n1. The ps3 software signing private key `C5 B2 BF A1 A4 13 DD 16 F2 6D 31 C0 F2 ED 47 20 DC FB 06 70`\n\n2. The AACS encryption key `09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0`\n\n3. The texas instruments keys `p = B709D3A0CD2FEC08EAFCCF540D8A100BB38E5E091D646ADB7B14D021096FFCD\nq = B7207BD184E0B5A0B89832AA68849B29EDFB03FBA2E8917B176504F08A96246CB\nd = 4D0534BA8BB2BFA0740BFB6562E843C7EC7A58AE351CE11D43438CA239DD99276CD125FEBAEE5D2696579FA3A3958FF4FC54C685EAA91723BC8888F292947BA1`\n\n4. The HDCP master key [which is a bit long](http://www.catb.org/~esr/hdcp-master.txt) to paste\n\nEtc etc. And despite this, it seems nobody has gotten screwed over so far. Contrast that to piracy, where tonnes of people have been absolutely reamed by eg the RIAA, and actively have faced legal consequences\n\nThe waters simply haven't been tested yet, and its not clear that nintendo would win this as a court case",

If a precedent were set that this kind of emulation were not illegal, then oh boy a lot of people would be very angry. That's why, despite extensive legal threats, none of this has ever been properly litigated despite decades of pseudo illegal numbers. They've all been seen off by the threat of a legal *defence* being set up, and hostile litigation has immediately run away at the concept of this being actually run through a court. Nintendo are terrified of a court case here\n\nAdditionally, nintendo views all unauthorised emulators as being illegal. This likely would have still happened even without the encryption key issue",

Obviously, it's a plausible train of thought to assume that piracy has an non-zero negative effect on revenue, which in turn would indeed stifle innovation as piracy would lower the profit incentive and might make investors reconsider their investment in this field. \"Greed\" (which is just outcome maximization) is the reason why gaming is fucking amazing today. The field is incredibly competitive and there's a lot of money to be made if you provide a product that appeals to the market. Anything that decreases the size of the market harms innovation. Good games are made because people want to make money. That is the sole reason. \n\nReliably measuring the potential impact of piracy is practically impossible in a real world scenario, but anyone arguing piracy has zero impact is just delusional. Of course it does. \"*Not everyone who pirated a game would have bought the copy if not for the pirated version*\" - no shit. Not everyone who chain smokes all their life gets lung cancer. 1.0 correlations don't exist in social behaviour (or medicine). Yet a causal link between smoking and lung cancer isn't up for debate, is it?",

Maybe for a small time relatively unknown developer the loss of sales are made up by the word of mouth and converting those who wouldn't buy the game. Nintendo already spends a lot on advertising and gets tons more free advertisement simply for being Nintendo. They also have an excellent reputation game wise. They also tend to have some of the most innovative developers. They see next to no positive benefits from piracy. It basically only loses them sales. Game development is a business. A business is doing better when it makes more money and allows them to take greater risks in innovation. It may not be the popular opinion around here but it's absolutely true when it comes to Nintendo.",

It's likely more effective for medium size devs or frankly revolutionary and extremely well made games. \n\nSmall devs don't have the time or capital to wait for the word of mouth effect. \n\nFor example an avreage good game doesn't likely get a lot from pirates.\n\nMost senarios it would just remain a loss.",

They were one of the first companies to introduce loot boxes into non-mobile games and make a success of them, and they have leant heavily into micro-transactions ever since. They were one of the first to successfully use a F2P model for non-mobile and non-mmorpg games, and again make a success of it. And steam itself is a mixed bag, there is a lot of trash and unfinished early access stuff on there, not unlike crappy mobile app stores.\n\nValve is great and I love their games, and I think the gaming world is better with them in it, but the fact that they behaved like a corporation, protected themselves from lawsuits and threw Dolphin off of steam is not at all surprising.",

Yes, Dolphin **might** not yet have been proven to violate copyright but it also hasn't been proven otherwise. If Nintendo sues and wins there problems might not have stopped with the Dolphin team but also affected Valve in this case as they could have been liable for \"secondary copyright infringement\".\n\nAs far as I understand this can happen based on two conditions: \n\n1.  Providing a means to commit infringement (i.e. listing it on the steam store for easy and wide availability)\n2. benefiting from the infringement\n\nas well as them knowing about the infringing material. \n\nValve being aware about the emulator, especially with the high profile and the description, would likely qualify as such. They don't have to wait until there is a DMCA and they do well not to. As they have no way to verify it, it makes sense to ask Nintendo if it qualifies as such and err on the side of caution. This is basically the same way they act, for example, in case of disputes between devs and publishers (delisting the game until the dispute about the rights is settled).\n\nDoes it suck? Sure. But lets not pretend like Valve is a Judas for \"bringing this to nintendos attention\" especially as they surely were aware.",

I get pirating, most people do it. However, anyone who pirates should expect the business to attempt to shut it down. Whining about it and calling a business evil because they won't let you play their games for free...is honestly stupid. \n\nIt's not like Nintendo is destroying the climate with fossil fuels, murdering people on the streets, or supporting extremist groups. All they're doing is, let's see, stop you from pirating games in an easily accessible manner. Nintendo wouldn't be able to remove emulation from the internet entirely. So a mild inconvenience isn't enough of a justification to go \"Nintendo evil wah wah\u201d or even compare them to an authoritarian state.\n\nIt\u2019s weird how much hate boner people have for Nintendo. To the point they sincerely think it\u2019s morally good to pirate their games while they support other companies that actually violates human rights. Both Microsoft and Sony has a lot of sexual harassment cases, but it\u2019s ok to gamers because at least they are discounting games and not against emulation. Like wtf? Are gamers\u2019 morality so twisted?",

That\u2019s why we avoided the spotlight because there are consequences and no one wants the emulators to disappear.\n\nNowadays? People got cocky and started to genuinely believe it\u2019s a social justice cause. They openly promote it because they think it\u2019s morally right to pirate. As long as it screws over a company (as if the employees aren\u2019t people), they\u2019re happy. They want awareness. They want it to spread because fuck capitalism.\n\nNow of course companies will start cracking down when people are so openly hostile toward them and their products. It\u2019s become a culture war of sort where it\u2019s anti-capitalism vs pro-capitalism - which I find to be absolutely ridiculous. Paying for games doesn\u2019t mean we are pro-capitalism. These devs still need to get paid. I can get it if Nintendo is using their profit for bad things like suppressing minorities, but Nintendo has done nothing except support them. Pretty much the only things morally bad about Nintendo is that they don\u2019t support unions or that NoA isn\u2019t managed well. If people used these as reasons for piracy, I can at least understand why they\u2019re so outspoken. But that\u2019s not it. All the people encouraging others to pirate about mad about\u2026Nintendo not porting their games to PC, not rereleasing their games, or not discounting their games. None of which are human rights violations nor owed to the consumer. Gamers have such a twisted sense of morality and priority these days.\n\nI think it has to do with gamers being accustomed to Steam\u2019s cheap prices and the growth of the industry in the recent decades. It led to a lot of entitlement because gamers finally feel in power instead of the nerd being bullied back in school. So they act out and do stupid shit like this while believing they\u2019re fighting for justice. I use emulators too, but I\u2019m not a narcissistic Karen who thinks I\u2019m \u201cowning\u201d the company saving some poor dude on the streets by piracy. I shut the fuck up and don\u2019t brag about it on the internet or try to start some social movement justifying piracy. I hate the emulation community nowadays because their priorities are wrong",

But this was never actually tested and resolved in court and is a grey area.) \n\nAnd Valve probably wasn't sure if that is okay or not and asked Nintendo. It's in Valves interest not to have illegal programs on their platform. In example there is no problem with the Dolphin core in RetroArch, which is also on Steam for a while now. Why is that allowed? Because the Dolphin core in RetroArch does not have these keys. That's the whole point.",

                    "comment": "To nitpick a few points here:\n\n1. The keys are not from leaked Nintendo code;\n2. The keys are not code;\n3. The legality of distributing a key like this is famously unknown and untested in the United States.\n\nLong-time Reddit users might remember that one of the first big stories relating to the site was about Redditors (and Digg users) making a meme of publishing the equivalent common key for HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs, the number beginning 2553, encoding it as a colored flag and a specific musical tone, or assigning algebra word problems as homework that would produce the key as a result. It sparked a popular debate about the smallest possible piece of intellectual property you can claim ownership of (that key, like the Wii common key, is a 32 digit number) and how you would enforce small numbers being illegal to depict or transmit. When the Motion Picture Association of America filed hundreds of cease and desist notices, legal experts were uncertain what would happen if it actually went to court. It was a front-page story on the American Bar Association's journal, which included a novel discussion of the mathematical implications. (For example, one cease and desist notice was regarding a picture of a black rectangle where the product of the four side lengths equalled the key. There was debate over whether the offender would be the person who drew the rectangle or the person who pointed it out.)\n\nIt never went to court and no case like it has ever been decided by a court. The closest it's come is when Sony sued someone who published the equivalent PlayStation 3 key, then settled the case out of court because they were concerned they'd establish an unwanted precedent. Similarly, Texas Instruments stopped sending notices to people who published the key for signing calculator firmware after the Electronic Frontier Foundation threatened to sue them in return for misrepresenting the DMCA. There are one or two cases like this per year and they never get decided.",

They spearheaded the lootbox industry in the west and enabled/profit from an entire black market gambling scene surrounding it. They also consistently refused refunds until being forced to comply by an Australian court. They're no better than many other companies in the gaming scene. I'd still put Nintendo as worse but Nintendo really goes above and beyond to fuck their fans as hard as they possibly can.",

Right now, Dolphin is widely available. It's not on steam, but it doesn't need to be. It's the biggest emulator project out there and the people that want it know how to get it.\n\nShould a DMCA claim be made, who's to say that Nintendo would stop at just Steam? If it's illegal on Steam, it's illegal on Github. Could Dolphin win a case against Nintendo? Maybe. But Nintendo has the money and legal resources to make that a small maybe.\n\nI could eat my words if Nintendo decides to go for it anyways, but at the moment it looks to me like Valve stopped Icarus from flying too close to the sun. It was for Valve's own benefit of course, but I think it was a good move.",

Nintendo not proactively filing a DMCA claim means that Valve acted on their own, rather than as legally required by the way DMCA works.\n\nTo be fair here. The description they had didn't do them any favor and makes alarm bells ring at the store its added to:\n\n&gt;Dolphin is an emulator for the big N's 6th and 7th generation consoles\n\nI see nothing wrong with valve asking Nintendo if everything is alright there. I expect there are more than enough examples of this happening ever since greenlight was first introduced, it just doesn't get as much public attention. It already happened with stuff like Minecraft getting added to greenlight.\n\nThe whole thing is also in line with valves general MO with other disputes like between publishers and devs. If the legal situation isn't clear they delist things until it is which is a safe bet if you end up being the one actively distributing something.",

We see her taking off her sunglasses from behind as she looks at Saga and Alan. \"Well, this is quite a mess you've made, mr. Wake. We finally meet. My name is Director Faden, and represent the Federal Bureau of Control. I see that we have quite a lot of catching up to do...\" Camera swivels around and we see Jesse's face as she stares into the camera. Cut to black.\n\n\n\"To be continued in CONTROL 2.\"",

He\u2019s also been manipulating smaller things, like how there\u2019s notes in the game about field agents encountering Alex Casey who is investigating Alan\u2019s disappearance. The agents are rightfully confused when they realize that a fictional detective is out in the world on an investigation. The Oceanview Motel also has a direct link to the Dark Place which is likely to be explored more in this game as there\u2019s an ad for the Oceanview in the first trailer.!&lt; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Jesse or a FBC agent of some sort show up in this game.",

From the Control wiki: \n\n\n&gt;The Hiss is a self-propagating force of interdimensional resonance. The Hiss is aggressive and virulent, described by Jesse as 'an earworm that you can't get out of your head'. It is unknown if the Hiss has a central point of transmission or amplification like the Hedron entity, or if the Hiss are a pervasive element throughout their home dimension. \n\n\n&gt;Most people when possessed by the Hiss signal float in the air, endlessly repeating the Hiss incantation, a mysterious poem of ambiguous meaning. It is unclear if this form of Hiss agent is otherwise harmless or if they are direct vectors for the signal's spread. Individuals with combat capacity whom the Hiss overtakes often remain mobile, and are able to attack the uninfected with the same skill they had as normal people. These possessed combatants lose their hair and experience violent physical deformation, leading Pope to theorize that the Hiss resonance can rearrange and modify the genetic and cellular structures of the body at the molecular scale. Despite often fatal physical distortion, these agents survive and are capable of using powerful paranatural abilities comparable to those of Jesse. The resonance of the Hiss can also manifest as physical phenomena, forming strong barriers that can even stop bullets; concentrated Hiss resonance can become Hiss clusters, which heal other Hiss agents.",

So he didn't create the FBC and Jesse and her brother, nor did he create the Hiss, but it seems he pushed for events to happen how they did to make Jesse director. They mention in the game that he can't do anything he wants, though, it has to follow a logical story structure, much like a book or a script. Presumably, he's doing this to help him eventually escape the Dark Place.!&lt;",

Most good shooters are \"combat puzzles\" where players must make decisions based on the scenario and current constraints. Games like the original Halo trilogy are more sandboxy in nature, where players have vehicles, weapons, grenades and are often given large open scenarios to express their skill. The key ingreto the combat puzzle in modern Doom games is the enemy variety, combination of enemies in each encounter, and the tools players have to dispatch them. Probably the closest comparison to Alan Wake would be something like Resident Evil 4, which is a surprisingly rich gameplay sandbox. The player has a number of interesting tools to use, and the enemy design and scenarios create all sorts of interesting combat puzzles. Yes, the shooting in that game is \"just aiming\" as well, but it has a level of richness that Alan Wake didn't have.\n\n\nI think there's a reason that one of the most fondly remembered gameplay sections is the setpiece where you're defending the big outdoor stage. Thats one of the few times where the scenario encourages players to engage with shooting mechanics in a more fresh way.",

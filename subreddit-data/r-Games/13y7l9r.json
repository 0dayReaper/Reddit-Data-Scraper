Items are mostly just \"number + X\" and several map PoIs are doing the same thing just with different numbers.",

There is a refreshing purity to be found there once you accept that this is not going to be like Civilization. \n\nIt's a very momentum driven style that focuses almost exclusively on map exploitation; with the goal being to hit an exponential power curve that is steeper than that of your opponents. I like to think of it as Pacman meets Vampire Survivors (but turned based).",

I loved to casually play HoMMIII, I liked to mix match creatures, build weird item sets that give you actual abilities and so on. That is mostly missing in SoC for me, I only have few creatures, items are all the same and such.",

However, I feel the general structure of what is there (what items do, etc) is faithful to that style and no less generic than what HoMM had (which, as I tried to explain above, in some sense thrives on being a bit generic). \n\nSoC's biggest casual letdown compared to HoMM is that you can't mix and match creatures &amp; factions. Which sort of kills a little bit of that \"gotta catch them all\" vibe HoMM had. On the postiive side of things SoC has a really interesting, and deep, combat/magic system that - once it grew on me - I found insanely addictive.",

Spells in combat quickly reach ridiculous 5D chess levels of absurdity and the spritework is gorgeous.\n\nIf I had one complaint, multiplayer is brutal and the single player campaign is a bit rough... But I can see myself playing it more as I get to better grips with it\n\nUnfortunately all my friends are currently on a date with AoW4",

I think it was because it was so number-crunching in my eyes. It just didn't click! AoW4 I'm digging, but I can't min-max there, as it's way too easy and I just go for roleplay strategies that fit with what I want to be... I guess that was not as easy in SoC also.",

More content would also be nice (I say this as someone with over 100 hours in early access).  But I\u2019m thrilled with what we have gotten.",

            "comment": "Bought this a few weeks ago &amp; highly recommend it. \n\nFactions with big rosters that are actually asymmetric. Each base unit has an upgrade that often provides new or upgraded unique abilities. Agree that items are a missed opportunity. Only providing scaling stat buffs. They don\u2019t really have you changing your build at all to account for them. Spells offset that for me. The amount of tactical flexibility provided by upgraded spell casters keep gameplay wildly fresh. Spells seem underwhelming until you level up your caster then then the fun scales to the moon &amp; back. When you start synergyzing with unique faction abilities it becomes power gaming at its best. \n\nBalance is pretty well done so you can have different builds for armies across a factions unit pools &amp; not feel punished for it. Even the cheapest units from early game have their tactical uses late game when upgraded &amp; utilized correctly. \n\n3 campaigns now which is pretty sweet considering cost for all the content. Only played through one so far but it\u2019s a great intro for how to play the game, &amp; learning systems. Tons of community generated maps &amp; levels as well to keep things fresh. \n\nBeautiful sprites, some really cool music. Between campaign missions bards will sing quick ballads about the stuff going on in your campaign. \n\nThis is such an easy buy imo for anyone even tangentially interested in the genre.",

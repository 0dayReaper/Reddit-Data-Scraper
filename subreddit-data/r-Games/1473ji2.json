We also have both new and arranged music. We\u2019ll be kind of releasing that information, following everything. So please look forward to that.\u201d\n\nThis isn't just a remaster or a graphics upgrade. They are remaking things from the ground up. The comments saying they are basing it on P3 don't sound to me like they are just disregarding the other versions, it just sounds like they mean this is Makoto's story, not Aigis or FeMC's. \n\nAigis' SL was in both FES and P3P. I can't see them not having a SL for a party member here unless they mean they want to be completely faithful to P3 even with all of its issues, which is already not what they are doing since they added controllable party members.",

It would be weird if they opened the trailer with her and you can't even hang out with her. Costumes are also almost certainly back in because not only is that easy money DLC, it's purely cosmetic (and they can easily include the holiday/weekend outfits as unlockable costumes since they're already modeled and everything).",

It HAS to be an equal or better experience than P5.\n\n We saw from the trailer it will have new locations from the movie, fighting has some of the QoL from P5. I feel like what they said might be genuinely true, they might've gone back to the original vision of the game and are rebuilding it from the ground up so it is something more captivating than the original P3/P3FES and on par with the P5. I don't think it's just P3 with pretty graphics.

This feels like... I dunno, like Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire's omission of the Battle Frontier. It would have been such an amazing crowd pleaser and garnered a lot of good will with their fan base so it makes you wonder why on Earth they decided not to pursue it.",

I recently replayed Persona 3 Portable both with the male and female protagonist, and not only did I vastly prefer the female protagonists because of much better the social links were and how they fleshed out a lot of your teammates, it also adds a massive amount of replay value.\n\nAtlus being Atlus.\n\nActually, I take it back. This isn't beyond Atlus being Atlus. This is what you'd expect from a parody account on Twitter making fun of Atlus. They've managed to not only not solve the Persona 3 issue of not having a definitive version, but instead make that issue even worse by just introducing yet another distinct version.

Because to me it sounds like they just mean they are focusing on Makoto's story, so not the added stuff from The Answer or FeMC.",

However, I also wouldn't expect content from FES and Portable to not be included in a remake of Persona 3, and that's exactly what's being confirmed in this article.\n\nThe reality is, the developers have stated that they're \"recreating the Persona 3 experience\" and have \"remade basically everything from scratch as for Persona 3 the original version\". Without knowing how much that entails, even with clear proof that certain aspects of the game are being changed or added on, it's impossible to know at this point what content the game will have based on what information we have now. Their words make it sound like any additional content from FES or P3P could be removed, simply because they're not a part of the original version that they're focused on remaking.\n\nThat being said, even if they do include all of the minutiae, and what's being left out is only The Answer and FeMC exactly, it still fails as a definitive edition of the game, which is what a remake of Persona 3 should be, which is the point of what I'm saying. Arguing about the small stuff isn't worth doing.",

It wouldn't be a complete edition, but it'd be the definitive version of Makoto's story, which is what 99.9% of people mean when talking about P3.\n\nI am not defending the choice of not porting over FeMC, but people are acting like this wholly changes the game and ruins it when the Makoto part of the game will most definitely be the best it's ever been. \n\n&gt; Arguing about the small stuff isn't worth doing.\n\nIt is when people are taking lines out of context and getting the impression this will just be vanilla P3 but in HD. If people want to complain that they are removing The Answer (for whatever reason) or FeMC, I get that, it's completely reasonable, but going as far as to complaining they are removing stuff we don't even know is being removed, and reading the response they gave in context gives the complete opposite impression, makes no sense to me. There's reasonable things to be mad about here, so why exaggerate and assume the worst?\n\nIf you think it's not worth arguing, why respond in the first place when it's literally my point?",

I've tried to refocus the conversation on the core point I'm trying to make, and you keep spinning yarn about the small stuff. The idea that Reload would in any way be \"Definitive\" without the Answer or FeMC is wrong. Persona 3 is not just Minato's story; without Aigis and Minako's campaigns, a remake is incomplete. As a game, it would lack major features that were core to prior versions. I do not find that acceptable.",

The point would be to remake the main story, the story that began it all. It's not a remaster, it's a remake. If it tells Makoto's story better than any of the other versions, that would make it the definitive way to experience that story. I don't think what I'm saying is controversial or complicated. If you think P3 needs The Answer of FeMC, was the original P3 a bad incomplete game?",

FEMC is great but not a core part of what makes P3 great. The Answer IMO is flat out bad and would need substantial reworks to be enjoyable.\n\nP3 was an experiment with a new gameplay format and it shows. The pacing is awful. There's dozens of hours between big story moments sometimes and there's simply not enough to do in its overworld. The game needs new story sequences, more content to do day to day, a more interesting tartarus, something to keep me engaged throughout. I have a soft spot for P3 but when I played it more recently I found the start to be good, the story arc in summer to be pretty good, and the last 10 hours to be good. The rest of the game felt way, way too barren. P4 and then P5 were when this formula was truly pushed to its full potential, and I think if we can have P3's story and world better realised this will be something special.",

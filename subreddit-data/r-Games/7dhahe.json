Between the beta, pre-order launch period, and early reviews people had enough time to work out how predatory and damaging the lootboxes were to the game early.  That allowed the lootbox narrative to dominate launch and let people cancel preorders.  If they just launched and people were pissed after they had already sold ten million copies EA would be caring far less about the complaints.",

That is the shining example of how you can make money off micro-transactions without being scummy.",

But CSGO works on a lootbox system exactly the same, \"just for cosmetics\". Yes, it doesn't affect gameplay in the same way, and that's good, but it's still a predatory system that gets in your face when playing.\nRight as you get into CSGO the microtransaction system is announced in your face in the main menu. It also gives you drops after certain games, of which some you can't access unless you buy a key. It also announces in your chat when a player in your server opens a lootbox and what the reward is to entice other players. Tbh, this whole system works because it targets people psychologically, and it stinks, even in CSGO.",

I guess I'm cynical as fuck. \n\nI've read the whole thing as \"the launch window is critical for us to get all yo money, so we'll do this last PR stunt to break the bad narrative, get the review scores up and convince people on the fence to jump in ASAP. See you loser's wallets in two months\".\n\nEDIT: /u/tonightm87 made a very good point about one possible side-effect of the backlash that actually got EA to act: unwanted government attention [ [permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7dhahe/ea_has_turned_off_ingame_purchases_for_star_wars/dpxv9w8/) ]:\n\n&gt; It's way more to do with government bodies looking into them, than us being pissed off. I can tell you one thing \n if a government body started putting regulations on EA and others, heads would roll off the chopping blocks for \ndays. If they were found breaking laws by targeting under age kids it would be long jail terms.\nEA looks after number one and that ain't us not by a long shot.\n\nThere's also a point I've been seeing around ([here](https://twitter.com/rcwagner01/status/931327252335177729), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7dh582/jason_schreier_rumor_is_that_e_a_is_about_to_pull/dpxr4o5/) and [here](https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/16/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions-go-offline-until-ea-can-make-changes/) (maybe the source?)), about Disney probably not liking the association between Star Wars and gambling that the press (the gaming one, as expected, but even [CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/16/technology/battlefront-ii-star-wars-game-gambling/index.html)) was making so close to the release of the new movie. So they getting away from that now would be a way to preserve the franchise (and it's ties to EA, especially after they cancelled Star Wars 1313) for the long run. \n\nEDIT 2: Welp, looks like being a cynical prick was the right call:\n\n*Battlefront microtransactions will tie into progression when they return*\n\n&gt; Today, EA announced that it will be removing microtransactions from Star Wars Battlefront 2. However, this is only a temporary measure until EA can achieve, what the company says is the \"right balance\" between those who want to progress through gameplay and those who want what they call an \"accelerated experience.\"\n\nhttp://www.usgamer.net/amp/ea-star-wars-battlefront-2-changes-will-balance-those-who-want-gameplay-progression-and-those-who-want-an-accelerated-experience",

I'd be more trusting of EA if they hadn't *repeatedly* shown their true colours over the past 10-15 years, buying up smaller studios and running their franchises into the ground, botching up so many of their game launches and then half-assing any apologies to their consumers (if they apologise at all), and taking the laziest possible approaches to making money. While some other companies have done a lot to legitimise gaming and to fill the industry with artistry and creativity, EA have gone for the lowest common denominator at almost every turn.\n\nThere's a reason I haven't bought an EA product in nearly a decade, and I have very little sympathy for any experienced gamer who buys into this and ends up disappointed a month or two from now. Unless one is fairly new to video games, one should know better.",

The average casual gamer who hasn't heard about the p2w aspects won't be won over by this decision. They're trying to get the more passionate gamers to change their minds and reverting and reintroducing p2w will gain them money for this game but hurt their overall image even more AND affect future sales from the morr hardcore gamers on Reddit",

Fuck a company that thought this design was acceptable, or that took this long and this much outrage to finally change it. \n\nLike they said, the game is ever evolving. That just means that just because they aren't fucking you now doesn't mean they can't fuck you after you pay 60 bucks or whatever",

Probably resort more to a system like in the Battlefield games which will be a stellar improvement over the current system.",

Even now, all progression can technically be earned through gameplay, it just takes a long time.  There's no indication that they will speed it up, but this is the kind of speak they use to make you hope they will.  It's been confirmed that when microtransactions come back, the purpose will still be to \"accelerate\" people through the progression.

My mom heard about this. It was a level of backlash they'd never seen before. \n\nThe truth is that selling a shitload of $60 games is massively profitable. At their peak the Call of Duty games were making more money than Avatar, then the biggest movie ever, in a *single day.* Battlefront has the ability to be that kind of franchise. But EA got greedy and tried to focus on easy microtransaction money at the expense of some of those $60 sales. But I think this backlash showed them that there was going to be a big enough dent in all future EA sales to cancel out the microtransation windfalls.\n\n",

There are games out there with cosmetic lootboxes which in my opinion are worse than what is/was in BF2. You could have the best star cards and still be bad at the game, but with cosmetics it's all about looking the best.\n\nLook at CSGO, Dota, TF2, Killing Floor, Overwatch etc.. people are dropping money in hopes they get that knife, very rare set, super duper awesome hat etc. You wanted lootboxes to be regulated so don't stop the fight just because EA/Dice has started to fix their mess. They aren't the only ones guilty, but they were the straw that broke the camels back.\n\nI'm not saying I'm 100% for or against lootcrates, but if you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.",

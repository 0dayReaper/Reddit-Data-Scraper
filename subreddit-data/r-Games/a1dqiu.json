Sure, you'll price a handful of folks out of the product, but a $50 price increase would certainly have covered the proper materials for a bag like originally shown.",

There's something rotten at the core at Bethesda and it's boiling through to the surface now.\n\nI really hope I'm wrong and the next ES game is another hit and Fallout 5 is a return to form, but I get the feeling that's just blind optimism at this point.",

If an entire studio branch gets shut down over one game that mostly scored 7-8s across all the major review sites, and was also considered financially successful per their earnings report, then either EA was completely inept in the management of their funds, or they were already considering shutting the branch down before the game was even released.",

Sure the game is thrown in there but time after time we see these collectors editions that clearly out sourced the construction of their bonus items and falsely advertised them to begin with. \n\nOne time my coworker got the collectors edition of the prima strategy guide for dark souls 3, with a letter opener and estus flask. The flask was a green rubber piece of garbage that couldn't be used to drink out of. It was also really small, and the letter opener sword was flimsy and probably broke shortly after he got home with it. \n\nThe entire time he kept on about how cool it was. \n\nI don't know if it's protection from buyers remorse, but it had to be one of the cringiest things I sat through. Opening that sad shitty 130 dollar pile of garbage. \n\nMore recently a coworker went on about how excited he was to get his 76 power armor edition. I told him it was a bad idea and the helmet wasn't nearly going to be the quality he expected it to be. \n\nHe wouldn't hear it and is probably either pretending its amazing or fuming in quiet rage. \n\nThe fact that people would drop this kind of money for the absolutely garbage quality collector editions keep putting out, makes it so sad to watch my friends waste money on it. \n\n\nGamers have a spending problem. Many people seem to have this need to spend ridiculous amounts of money on garbage. I feel like these are kids who never got over having toys as a kid and became dependent on them. \n\nAlso the fallacy that somehow these things would be worth more money in the future is only true if the collectors edition was desired for and was actually kept in the box. 99 percent of the time these people don't so I don't understand what they expect. The whole return on investment is an excuse to trick themselves into buying overpriced toys. ",

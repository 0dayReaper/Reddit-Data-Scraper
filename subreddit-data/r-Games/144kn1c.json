He eventually found a way to return to form with all his memories and its through cloud. That's where we get to remakes events. \n\nEssentially all remake is is sephiroth using clouds own memories of him to return to form and will himself to existence. Personally speaking I don't think there are timelines. All the Zack timeline is is the flow of those prior memories from the Lifestream being changed. The purpose was to disconnect Zack from cloud. In the original cloud finding his true identity is what helps him defeat sephiroth and his hold over him. So technically while Zack lives in remake, it creates something similar to a time paradox. Since Zack died but the past was changed it's made that memory disconnected from cloud so he is stuck..\n\nI think even in rebirth we will see Zack but it will never be an instance of two different universes/timelines. Most likely just memories and the Lifestream affected because of sephiroth/jenovas influence",

This is similar, just in a different way. Veteran players can have more context and maybe have more theories on whats happening, new players can get on the \"what is happening\" rollercoaster and have it explained further into the game.",

But if you loved Part 1, and was curious about how the series would continue because the timeline stuff is a mystery to you, I think you will continue to enjoy Part 2 and even Part 3, as I strongly believe the mysteries will be solved as you play more of the games. It remains to be seen of course, but that's just my feeling on the matter.",

OK, they come out ahead for the first disc, but what if they ever need it re-download it? And what if they download it 4 times? Normally Sony pays the networking fees, but Square has to pay for the Blu-ray discs.",

            "comment": "Geoff is a troll and I love it. They showed FFVII earlier in the show, only for it to be a mobile spin-off. He absolutely knew he'd piss people off by showing what everyone wanted and expected, FFVII, only for it to not be Rebirth.\n\nBut all of that was just a setup for him to close the show by saying \"the rumours were true\" and revealing this. Honestly, Geoff is a great host. He doesn't get up on stage and talk like someone who's selling a product, he talks like any normal fan of these games would, and he messes with the audience by directly acknowledging their expectations and playing off of them.\n\nIn the wake of E3 dying and major publishers shifting to digital presentations, it's great to see a live conference again, and one hosted by someone with genuine charisma and care for what's presented.\n\nAlso, TWO DISCS. Is this the first two disc game of the current generation? How massive is this thing?",

Before his \"death\" he sent his future knowledge to his past self to do things differently to ensure his victory.\n\nThis leads to a Zack timeline where we see the OGs dying in the trailer as Cloud wasn't there to pull them away and thus lead them to a safer path. Zack realizes through this turmoil that Sephiroth is responsible via that timeline's Cloud being turned into a drone, as we see in the trailer.\n\nZack then somehow finds a way to move to the remake timeline where he knows the full party is still possibly alive. To have a \"reunion\" as drone Cloud alludes to.\n\nWe'll then get that iconic death where Cloud has to choose them or Zack to die, powerless to stop it and forced to choose. Thus leading to a further emotional beat for a similar event while mixing it up and now putting the choice in players' hands to cope with.",

It's early here.* \n\nIf you're playing Final Fantasy remakes for anything other than absurd, indulgent, gratifying fanservice, I am surprised! Personall, I can't imagine how else you thought it might have gone. \n\nEven without the timeline stuff, which you can fairly say was a ~~bait and switch~~ surprise, 7R was always going to be a 30+ hour game based on the first 5-10 hours of VII - what else could it ever have been but an indulgent, padded nostalgia trip?\n\nIf you want a more serious game, other Finals Fantasy might fill the void. Have you tried FFXIII, FFXV or FFXVI?",

It operates in a similar capacity to the Weapons: seeking and destroying the biggest threat to Gaia\u2019s survival. \n\nI thought the ending of OG was very unambiguous with Red XIII stating that Holy was actually helping pull Meteor closer towards the planet, since it has decided (through the planet\u2019s will) that humanity is a greater existential threat than an asteroid impact (something planets are able to weather). \n\nAerith, the one who cast Holy in the first place, realizes that the initial plan is actually speeding up the extinction of mankind, and works to dispel it through her connection to the Lifestream. Holy begins to dissipate and the Meteor is enveloped and destroyed, saving everyone. \n\nAdvent Children basically demonstrates the aftermath of this apocalyptic event by showing that the planet is still lashing out against humanity through the spread of Geostigma (spurred along by Sephiroth\u2019s malevolent influence on the Lifestream as well now). \n\nI personally thought that this always fit with the eco-friendly message of the game (mankind is a disease that is killing the planet).",

Even if you wanted to take the perspective that Holy isn\u2019t executing the planet\u2019s will (it is), it was activated far too late for it to actually have an effect on stopping Meteor. The party\u2019s plan failed. \n\nThe Jenova Cells are what help propagate Geostigma through humanity (you have to remember, most people were exposed to Jenova\u2019s DNA through the livestream explosion at the end of the game). Now, why didn\u2019t the Lifestream immediately dissolve Jenova\u2019s head when it was thrown into the reactor?? Good question, ask Nojima. \n\nThe cold open of AC shows that humanity eventually dies off somewhere between the end of the original game and some 500 years into the future. It\u2019s impossible to not speculate that this is a result of the planet\u2019s lingering animosity towards mankind for their continued malevolence (they literally went from harvesting the Lifestream to drilling for oil\u2026).",

Even with my lack of experience I still knew a lot about the big moments and characters simply through gamer cultural osmosis. I think its awesome that its like half remake half sequel. Or its literally Sephiroth trying to \u201cremake\u201d the original story. It makes things more interesting. You cant feel like you know for sure where things are going despite it being the same journey in most ways. \n\nAlthough, nostalgia is a hell of a drug and theres a huge amount of oldhead fans who are still bitter about it. Im not saying the execution was perfect or even really super great but it was fun and ambitious and not as bad or confusing as people make it out to be.\n\nOh and I would heavily recommend the game, its fucking awesome. Not perfect as it has its flaws and rough stretches but overall I had a blast",

If they end up loving this game too thats fine of course. \n\nI hate typing this cause it sounds like my way is the only valid one lol, but thats not what I mean. I just want new people to get similar things to what I got out of the old game, and I just don\u2019t think that can be accomplished with what they are doing. If they get something else from the new material thats meaningful from this, obviously thats fine.

And the layman won\u2019t know any better, they\u2019ll assume its the same thing, just better graphics. \n\nIt just sucks that there is nothing for people that were never gonna play the old game cause it\u2019s old, but the new shiny version is literally not the same story. It\u2019s interesting for sure, but it for sure feels like it\u2019s for people who have played it more than for new audiences.\n\nGreat for people who want that. But obfuscating and confusing for newcomers. And the discourse is forever muddied cause there\u2019s 2 different interpretations of a work.

It's fun and exciting to share things you like with people, and the sequel means we kind of get to do that, but we also kind of don't.\n\nDifferent topic, but the sequel nature of the game also makes it frustratingly difficult to recommend. I want to be clear, despite some critical misgivings I have about FF7R I *do* like it and think people should play it. However, the game is very fundamentally a reaction to a nearly 30 year old PS1 title, and it feels weird to tell someone to play it if they don't have that context. Obviously, many people have played it and enjoyed it without said context, but  regardless it makes it *personally* difficult to recommend all the same.",

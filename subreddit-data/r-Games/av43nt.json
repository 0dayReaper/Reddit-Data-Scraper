Emotes are now purchasable for $100+ or gold bars (Boins). It's clear Rockstar wants players to spend money on their premium currency because hunting activities which were already low paying have been cut in half, so these weapons and cosmetics are effectively 2x as costly for players who hunt for their income. \n\nThe Evans Repeater was listed as part of this patch but is now \"coming soon\" even though one of the new daily assignments requires getting kills with it. The repeater appears to be an online only addition as it does not appear at all in single player stores. The other gun, the \"rare shotgun\" is a double barrel which is actually worse than the normal double barrel when ungraded. \n\nNew activities are bugged and unavailable , and the only bug fixes made in this patch appear to have been ones that allowed players to make money too quickly. While horses still reset to bond level 1 and beard styles are not selectable, Rockstar targeted three star pelts dropping from one star animals under certain conditions and using animal carcasses to bait finish was removed completely.\n\nTLDR: they are trying to kill the game",

Once your game has a fairly established playerbase with lots of time invested and better gear then they're far more willing to spend money on the game.\n\nRockstar is doing the exact opposite of ^ that ^",

Nobody really expected it to have much meat on the bones but it was packed with fun activities and there were plenty of opportunities for players to create their own fun. And it was still monetised but in a way that offered something significant for your money, new skins, weapons and modes.\n\nRDR2 Online is a blatant cynical cash grab designed to force grinding or force the money out of player's wallets with very little room for player driven antics. Even it's competitive modes leave a lot to be desired when the grind for the guns and gear necessary to play competitively seems designed to force players to pay more money. Say what you want for GTA Online but at least you don't have to grind for several hours to be able to afford basic clothing, weaponry and vehicles. Sure you'll be playing a while to afford the high end stuff but at least there's plenty you can take part in without it. ",

They can constantly create new cars, new planes, new helicopters, new boats, and new businesses to add to the game.\n\nYeah, sure, at some point Supercar #71 is gonna be similar to Supercar #3 or Supercar #81, but who cares? Fans of the car are gonna buy Supercar #71 anyway because they love that car.\n\nOr maybe Rifle #17 is the same as Rifles #10-15, but it looks cool so who cares?\n\nWith RDRO... They don't have that benefit. They can add new horses, maybe, but so what? A horse is a horse (of course of course). There's not the same level of excitement for that.\n\nOn top of that, they have a limited selection of fire arms available, and in terms of criminal shit, there's not a lot they can draw upon.\n\nRDRO was never going to be as successful as GTAO because of it.",

I liked that \"darker\" vibe to it, really. And Niko was such a good protagonist. In my opinion that darker vibe fits GTA story more than GTA V style of story.  \n\nI didn't have good memories for GTA IV as a PC player, but replayed it few years back and it was better than I expected.\n\n",

Anybody could\u2019ve kicked his head in, and it just happened to be trevor at that point. Was Johnny\u2019s story really gonna have a happy ending after everything that\u2019s happened? When she\u2019s crying over the corpse and it shows his caved-in head, it\u2019s one of the few moments in V that actually feels pretty rough to see and isn\u2019t just edgy humor.

There comes a certain point where there is no more room to grow when the market is saturated e.g. when you are the most popular game on the market for years on end.\n\nOnce you reach this point the only ways left to grow is to start squeezing your customers or cutting costs, because it isn't enough to make millions, you have to make *more* millions to please those shareholders.\n\nInevitably this leads to the product turning to absolute horseshit over time and when there is finally nothing left to milk it is written off and on to the next victim. \n\nEA has been doing this for decades, now everyone is doing it. AAA Gaming is dying because of it.",

It prioritized its story above everything else, and whether you agree or disagree with that, it was NOT the most financially lucrative they could have made (that'd be GTAVI).",

You know, some people call it single player gaming, we do have most of our eggs in that basket: Because, that's the thing we do well... and I don't want to go to those teams and tell them \"I read in a magazine that there's something called games as a service, make me one of those!\". I don't want to be that guy. So, that's what we do. We do Horizon, we do God Of War, we do Detroit, Uncharted, The Last Of Us. These are things we're gonna continue to lean into very strong. So I see our content story continuing to play out that way.\"                \n                  \nSo if your tiered of every company seeming to release half baked ideas failing to deliver, money grubbing MXT laden games built to reinforce milking whales and as a whole GaaS which at this point just seems like a code for \"We release this shit now, if you complain we give a road map later, maybe we do that shit.\" then honestly as fanboyish as it sounds, buy a fucking PlayStation.        \n             \nIf you play PlayStation/Nintendo 1st party exclusives your probably well aware of how well they are done, if you dont then your truly missing out this gen on the best games being made. So no. I dont think big company = greedy cunts, but I do think greedy cunts keep trying to become the next big company.",

I know a lot of gamers and absolutely none of them spent more than a couple hours in the online mode before just going back to the way-more-fun single player mode. \n\nIt just isn't that much fun after the initial novelty wears off. Total shame too because I think there was a lot of potential if they weren't focused purely on monitization. ",

I played a decent amount of GTA Online before they started monetizing it, and it was equally not fun.  I think these are games that just don't lend themselves to online.  And then everyone who plays them is horrible.  \"Hello stran-oh, you've murdered me.\"  Or you start a race, and two people *immediately* pull a 180 so that they can slam in to you head on.  They could do that anywhere, but they specifically chose to join a game where everyone was ostensibly agreeing to race, just to ruin that experience for other people.  That's their idea of a \"fun online experience.\"  As long as they exist, I will stay away.",

GTA:O also had goals the player could try to achieve, different vehicles to buy (from cars to buses to choppers to boats) and apartments to try and get, where RDO virtually only has horses and clothing items.\n\nGTA:O for better and worse did make you feel as if you were climbing up the ranks. Weapons were level-gated but their prices were always fair. Most things were actually priced fair with only a select handful of luxury items (such as high-end apartments) being pretty expensive. This, I thought, was pretty fair.\n\nOf course then they realized how much Shark Cards brought in and after that most every DLC required you to buy a business to get started with it. Shame.\n\nIt seems RDO has skipped GTA:O's first promising days and gone straight for the jugular with monetization. *Everything* in RDO costs more than its single-player counterparts, and money is much harder to come by.",

It's long and grindy but not impossible. Contact missions until you have $50,000, register as VIP and work your way up to a 10-car apartment, do OG heists, get CEO office, get crate warehouse/Import-Export warehouse, then get into gunrunning or biker businesses (whichever tickles your fancy), try the hangar business, then get the Nightclub when you have everything else. Every level works up to the next. Sure everything new is expensive, but it's pretty much just another endgame atop another endgame for payers who gave played for a long time. As a result, a lot of older content that is cheap as fuck. Hell for longest time the best sportscar in the game was fucking *free.*\n\nHowever here come RDR2, where just to *buy some fucking guns* you end up paying a ridiculously high amount. $250 in RDR2 is comparable to about $250,000 for GTAV. And that is for a *basic fucking rifle.* There's no slow increase of price and money making, where it's at least *possible* to get started from nothing.\n\nRDR2 has gone straight into endgame prices at the start gate.",

All I really want in it is just a fast horse that doesn't drain stamina fast. Once I have that well, I am good.   \n   \n GTA:O there are a variety of good looking cars that I would want to get. I ended up getting one of the $2 million I think cars but I wanted more then just that. I got a fast car but now I want this other fast car because of how cool it looks. I want to customize my cars with some nice upgrades and a paint job so it looks even more amazing. I also wanted a jet or a helicopter with machine guns when I ride to the airport.   \n   \nLike the game has a lot to offer in terms of rewards so you are a bit motivated to grind if you want. Red Dead, playing last night after doing a few stranger missions, my friend and I went silent while I figured out what else we could do for fun. Could be because it's in beta but honestly I feel if they keep trying to make money hard to get in this game and not even have much rewards to put that money towards, why even bother? ",

I know they're shocked by this development despite watching GTA:O become more and more cordoned off by pay walls as time went on while incentivising griefing other players who are grinding..",

I'd also imagine the BR genre as a whole would benefit from this since they're proper games as a service. \n\nI think the difference there though is that they only sell cosmetics and nothing that actually effects your in-game abilities whereas R*'s games as basically pay-to-win or grind for multiple years to get on everyone else's level.",

In particular, the Career mode. What started as a great way to build up your own character and actually be an NBA star has turned into a slog of a grind FILLED with advertisements both as background stuff and things you can't fucking avoid. I cannot stress the last thing enough. Whenever anyone calls a timeout in game, you have to go through 5 seconds or so of Gatorade banners and logos before you can skip the cutscene. \n\nThey even changed the way you interact with MyCareer by making an actual hub world that pales in every way to the menu based system you used to have. This is most likely a way to interrupt the action just enough to get even more advertisements in your face. \n\n",

After the base was established rockstar slowly made the pricing more and more egregious and the paywalls got higher and higher. \n\nWith RDR2 they came out of the gate trying to process gouge and all it did is turn people off. Making money is way to hard and it's an instant turn off. \n\nThe single player was still worth it",

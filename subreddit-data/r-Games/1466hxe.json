Of course LoF always had that, but they're making it more noticeably overt that &gt;!the supernatural force behind everything (whatever The Rat Queen is) is using these artists to feed off their suffering and ambitions.!&lt;\n\nIn the original Layers of Fear, the Rat Queen stuff is relatively subtle. Here it's super in your face. I do wonder about the loss of subtlety, but it's a case where the original was so subtle very few people understood it. &gt;!A lot of people walk away from LoF thinking it's a game about a painter who goes crazy. When it's actually about a painter being manipulated by a demonic being.!&lt;",

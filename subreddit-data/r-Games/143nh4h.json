The big damage Eikon, if you want to emphasize on that, seems to be actually based around [Titan, as you can see here on Titan's \"Windup\"-skill that emphasizes on straight damage.](https://youtu.be/kFiBI8I4rbs?t=433), which wasn't shown on this preview, and might not be something that has been unlocked by the time the preview's gameplay takes place in.\n\nThat isn't to take account to possible items and equipment that could affect further stats, as well as what other abilities you choose to utilize during the enemies's Stagger-phase where they take increased damage output, so there seems to be an element of player prioritization on when to utilize abilities and what opportunities between said abilities's utilities, versus their damage outputs, as the Eikonic abilities are also on cooldown-basis. In summary though, the general opinion I get from previewers who actually have played the game seems to put combat being excellent overall with a good amount of depth and customization.\n\nAlso, hijacking this thread a little just to mention that [IGN Japan has 60 FPS-combat footage from around 07:00 mark on what seems to be the game's Performance mode, and then switches to Fidelity-mode during cutscenes](https://youtu.be/9DGVxcUdXLo?t=418). I'm personally not accumulated enough to notice if there are any FPS-drops, but it seems to at least run smooth without any notable issues to my eyes. Seems to be setting up a smooth launch so far.",

And its okay to fight the same enemy 30 times because by the 30th time you've learned to beat them in a couple seconds. The fun comes from mastering the game so you can breeze past enemies that used to be major roadblocks. If you could never learn to breeze past enemies, because they all take a couple minutes to kill minimum, then the game would soon feel tedious.",

FF is visually very satisfying and honestly as someone who didn't play any of the early FFs, I think the art is probably most of the appeal for me, lol. So it doesn't really matter to me that the gameplay isn't turn-based or whatever other changes have been made to the \"classic formula.\"",

And Octopaths and Bravelys are great, but they don't have same amount of polish, shine and late game content. They might be experimenting on some new ideas, but they don't really push the genre (turn based, command oriented, party following, story centric rpgs) as whole forward. There are lots of entries for fans of the genre to play, but there isn't really kind of flagship introductory title you could show to someone who is new to the genre.\n\nNow, my expectations for FFXVI are still positive despite there not being a proper controllable party and it being closer to beat-them-up in combat mechanics, but I have very diverse taste in games, and I can also understand that some who don't might feel anger, because FF used be their flagship and now it is someone else's.",

Put all that together and you get a lot of anticipation, but also a lot of concern.\n\nDoesn't help that those big enemies do legitimately seem way too spongy for how often they show up. Like they dumped a full Devil Trigger meter into that guy *while he was staggered* and at the end had done like 25% of his health. Fine for a miniboss, less so for an enemy type it seems like you'll be finding in every other pack.",

I picked it up a few years back on PC to try again and Hope is just the absolute worst. Even worse than Vanille, and that's saying something. The dialogue just grated on me like Kingdom Hearts dialogue does, and the plot and world-building was not interesting enough for me to get over it.\n\nIt's a shame because from what they had showed of that and (what was at the time) Versus XIII, I was so pumped for *Fabula Nova Crystallis*. What a massive disappointment it was.\n\n14 rekindled my love for the series and 15 was interesting in its own way. I'm looking forward to this.",

None of this looks enjoyable. It also looks too much like they took the boring gameplay of 15 rather than continuing the fun combat system of 7 remake.\n\nThat's where I can imagine others frustration come from too. The 16th entry in a beloved series that did one thing incredibly well over and over again has now taken a completely different turn and suffers for it.",

The first \"gameplay\" trailer of 13 was just a cutscene with a UI slapped on it, they didn't have a vertical slice done until the Advent Children blu-ray demo about a year before release. The development chaos of 15 is probably well-known by now.\n\nNaoki Yoshida isn't some miracle worker, but he's the rare producer in the game industry that properly sets up a realistic development roadmap with his team. While FF14 doesn't do anything particularly innovative for MMOs, it's been a remarkably consistent game with solid story and gameplay fundamentals.\n\nPreviews for 16 likely aren't going to generate much buzz because the design priority seems to be delivering a good game, rather than the company trying yet again to chase its old glories of being on the cutting edge of presentation and visuals.\n\n13 and 15 got good reviews at launch, but I'm feeling confident that 16 won't have some glaring issue like those games did, which contributed to their divisive reputation. I think people will have some fondness towards this one after it's out.",

Even among Tales fans I noticed a lot of people recommended setting the difficulty lower just to speed up combat because enemies had such high HP pools, and usually they're a community that likes to turn the difficulty up as much as possible (the hardest ones usually being locked behind progression or NG+).\n\nBut it's weird because I actually felt the opposite way about normal encounters (bosses did feel a bit overtuned, for sure). Your normal attack combos do very little damage, but as soon as you start 'breaking' enemies and using your burst attacks everything starts dying in seconds with flashy combo finishers. Like you can start to struggle to even do anything meaningful in combat because things die too quickly. I guess it really just comes down to how much you enjoy normal combat/random encounters and how easily you can avoid them when you want.",

Sure on high difficulties that can definitely be the case but on normal? Enemies die at a very normal pace. There's definitely no \"earth shattering magical combos that do 3% damage\" lol. I mean the most powerful attacks can clear the entire screen in one hit.",

Of those that don\u2019t some seem to have the feeling that something of what used to define Final Fantasy game has been lost with this game. Or they just dislike action combat. \n\nWhether or not Final Fantasy has changed in the past is utterly irrelevant though. \n\nWhat we are all dealing with is opinions which ultimately are based on feelings or seemings, not a scientific conclusion drawn by extensive study of hard facts. Yet people attack other opinions and bolster their own as if it\u2019s all a big chess game to be won. There\u2019s discussion to be had that\u2019s not based on people trying to prove or disprove some facts about the past. \n\nWhat does telling someone that Final Fantasy cannot have a battle system that doesn\u2019t feel like Final Fantasy because the battle systems of Final Fantasy games has differed in the past actually do? This isn\u2019t a debate to convince the jury of a contest. It\u2019s a discussion between people. Humans talking about a piece of art they have a feeling about.\n\nIn the other direction, calling people excited for the game out as just being DMC fans or people who just want to see pretty particle confetti, which apparently is too base of a desire, is needlessly antagonistic as well. For a lot of people this really does seem like a Final Fantasy game and has a lot to be excited about. \n\nBut all some people want to do is act as if discussions on a discussion platform (as far as Reddit comments are one) are logic puzzles.",

A minor spray that doesn't obscure the screen when items fly in or on basic strikes, or the giant waves of particle effects in obvious combo finishers, seem neither overbearing nor out of place to me.\n\nLike, inasmuch as there is a problem here, to me it doesn't seem like it's the number of particle effects so much as some basic attack strings relying on fairly transparent slash lines with less-tightly bound particles making the attacks ambiguous, which does look a little odd, but doesn't seem anywhere close to unreadable, and that's on a compressed video where transparent slashing is absolutely the most likely thing to get lost in the sauce.",

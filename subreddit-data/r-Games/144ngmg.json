They added 15, each as big or bigger than the non-tutorial levels. Easily like 3-4x the size it was at launch and didn't ask a penny for it.",

It seemed popular and was occasionally featured as a top seller on Steam during sales but nothing crazy. \n\nBut wow, you're right. Over 40 mil. Apparently they sold it for under a dollar in China or something like that and that makes up something like 80% of its sales.",

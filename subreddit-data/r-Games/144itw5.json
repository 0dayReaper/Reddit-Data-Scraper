For him looking so light, he kinda feels like a heavier build in a Souls game. \n\nI\u2019m forever in love with how fast Bloodborne is and continually disappointed that no one but maybe Sekiro has come close to that speed. Being able to instantly attack right after dodging towards an enemy feels so elusive outside of Bloodborne and Sekiro. \n\nBut it\u2019s still surprisingly solid.",

Locations look amazing tho. The first boss battle was awful. I bought some electric buff item for my weapons and he went down too fast. Also I kinda don't feel the dodge and the power attack of this shitty sword has such a short range.  Overall I am going to wait for sale.",

The dodge is really not good though. There are attack animations that look like they are over but still won\u2019t allow for a dodge right after. I switched controllers just to see if my O button wasn\u2019t working but nope, it\u2019s just a very unresponsive dodge. You can even just tell when standing still, the input delay is awful. Hopefully that gets fixed with final release, along with the camera not following while running.",

There's no clear parry or riposte animation you just perfect parry and keep attacking, compared to like a Bloodborne, sekiro, mgr, Metroid dread , wo long when enemies stagger or take clear gauges.

Which is honestly cool, like I\u2019m enjoying learning the new play style. Krat feels like a more polished and slightly more modern Yharnam which I\u2019m living for and the dark, violent take on Pinocchio is so fucking rad. I haven\u2019t even beat the demo yet, got a ways past the hotel and hit a difficulty spike and had to step away for a bit, but overall it\u2019s amazing so far.",

I like Fromsoft games because they\u2019re responsive, snappy, they sound and look great so I don\u2019t mind trying the same boss over and over again. If one of these criterias don\u2019t match my expected standard of quality I simply stop playing DS clones because why would I play an inferior version of what I already have? \n\nThis game shocked me because I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting to enjoy it at all based on my taste in these sort of games. I suggest everyone who might be interested to give it a chance. Not saying it\u2019s From\u2019s level but honestly it holds up I think",

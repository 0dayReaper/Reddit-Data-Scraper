It isn't that I can't afford another system, it's just that my entire library of games is on Playstation, along with my friends and trophies. And I platinumed Senuas Sacrifice, so to not be able to play the next one (which is a sequel to one of my all time favorites) unless I shell out another $500 is kind of sad. $500 for one game (unless another Psychonauts is announced) seems likes an easy pass",

Microsoft takes no royalties from software sales on Windows.  Unlike *all* of the consoles, there are no licensing or publishing fees.  They make no money except for what you paid for Windows itself (a one-time cost) and it does a whole lot more than just play games.\n\nThese games aren't even exclusive to Microsoft digital storefronts on PC.\n\nWhy is Windows not neutral in these contexts?",

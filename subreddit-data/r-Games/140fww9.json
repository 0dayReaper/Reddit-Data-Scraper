    "postText": "I\u2019m a 15 year Call of Duty veteran turned solo dev working on my first indie game Particle Hearts.  Players explore a game world of particles and use special abilities to manipulate those particles, solve puzzles, avoid detection, and uncover the role they play in this sinister and beautiful land.  Inspired by games like Zelda and Journey, Particle Hearts is a single player game that asks players to think differently, as the particles surrounding them are often the tools needed to proceed.\n\n[Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZo9phcg7i8)\n\n[Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074740/Particle_Hearts/)",

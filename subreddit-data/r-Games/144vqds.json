I thought the Summer Games Fest showcase was pretty good, and it's still early days for them as an event so I expect it to generally continue to get better. Keighley is a guy who clearly just loves gaming as a medium and I would say he's the right person to have guiding these events.",

I bought the magazine monthly anyways so I never missed out on anything. I didn't care that there was separate SE, Ubi, Sony, Nintendo showcases or stage shows because I just bought a magazine roundup.\n\nThese last few years I might see a SGF Trailer hit the front page of reddit. Then I find the /r/games megathread and go through the links one by one. If nothing hits my frontpage for some reason then I'd completely forget there even was an event. And with reddit seemingly desperate to drive me away I'm not sure what the next replacement is. Maybe revisit a site like IGN or Gamespot or Eurogamer... But it doesn't solve the issue of knowing when these events are. I'm not going to check these blogsites 365 days a year.",

Just a week of amazing reveals and info on upcoming releases. 99% of us never went to E3 but loved the hype and build up of the conferences throughout the week. \n\nThat's what needs to come back, but it seems like the studios don't care to, especially since the way they do things now means more time in the spotlight rather than sharing the stage with a sea of surprises.",

The crowd didn't bring too much energy this time, the pacing between trailers was slow, and the closed captions were abysmal. I know a lot of people love the *idea* of a live crowd at these kind of events, but I think the benefits of a tightly edited broadcast are more enjoyable and considerate of my time. Maybe I have been spoiled by prerecorded shows, but this only cemented my opinion of preferring them.",

So you get all those ads like doordash or that Twisted Metal show (jfc) frequently dispersed in the show. Add to the fact that the big players are still holding their own showcases, so a large amount of games (at least the very big hitters) are being held for that. I'm surprised SGF got SM2's release date, FF7Rebirth first legit trailer, and Yakuza.\n\nAnd do people forget that E3 wasn't that great for the most part?

E3 was for the industry largely, and it meant that it prioritized the priorities of industry clients.\n\n  \n\n\nSGF, on the other hand, wants it to go on as long as possible to fit in as many ad breaks as possible (for an event that is already basically a glorified advertisement lmao), so you get full announcements of things like Season 4 of this game, and a mobile spin off of that game.\n\n  \n\n\nI think if you had an E3 and SGF that presented the same content, the E3 version would be better due to it being editted down and condensed instead of being so sprawling.",

The E3 presentations were several showcases in a span of 2-3 days. Sure, each individual one was incentivized to be as succinct as they could be, but the zeitgeist has it as all of them falling under a general \"E3\" umbrella. \n\nThe SGF showcase is trying to be that in the span of a singular showcase and that bloats it up. Is that on purpose to fill ad space? Possibly, but I don't necessarily think so. I just feel that they are trying to cram as much as they can in one showing. I have a lot of respect for trying to do so - especially when they give indies a spotlight. But that bloat is definitely an issue. It wouldn't be so bad if it was bloated with great stuff (as subjective as that sounds). But anything not directly gaming related shouldn't have a place there. Keighley should have just retweeted the Witcher and Twisted Metal trailers. \n\n&gt;I think if you had an E3 and SGF that presented the same content, the E3 version would be better due to it being editted down and condensed instead of being so sprawling.\n\nI disagree. The only difference would be getting the content in one sitting versus over several days.",

We used to get a ton of soulless slop in the 2000s aswell, you just don't remember it because it wasn't worth remembering. I mean the grey 2007 era corridor shooter with a dude-bro protagonist is a meme these days. Games used run like crap much more, as people cared less optimization. We used to get laughable voice acting with awful scripts much more than now. That doesn't mean the entire industry was somehow bad back then.\n\n&gt; These were games created by actual artists, no silly dramas, no holding back, no greedy back handed tricks, just pure art.\n\nI don't think the phrase \"rose-tinted glasses\" quite covers this lol. Really, no greed or back handed tricks? No drama? This is just plainly untrue.\n\nDo you actually want me to list examples of good modern day releases? If we're talking just 2023 releases we've had Zelda, Hi-Fi rush, Street Fighter 6, Dead Space Remake and RE4 Remake. I could list more games like Jedi Survivor and Diablo 4 which I think are excellent but wouldn't quite meet your criteria because of mtx or performance issues - I think they aren't ruined by them at all, but I understand we might have a different tolerance there. I also really enjoyed Like a Dragon Ishin and Wo Long Fallen Dynasty though they weren't perfect. I also only tried a bit of it but I thought Wild Hearts was a fun experiment on the monster hunter formula. Warhammer 40k Boltgun and System Shock also look really good if you're looking for something that feels more classic. I could make a list like this for 2022 aswell, and so on.\n\nI'm not saying this entire list has to appeal to you, obviously not, though I feel like most people will find something they like at least. You can have a cynical view of the remakes if you want for example, though I don't personally mind them. But at the end of the day those are all games which got high praise, both critically and in their fanbases (mostly, we know most fandoms can't agree on anything). Which to me goes against this idea of gaming somehow being worse now, than this made up version where everything used to be amazing and game developers started being greedy in 2010, because that's a fantasy.\n\nI'm not saying we're not getting crap either, obviously we are, but I don't think its as simple as \"gaming bad now, no good AAA games left\", because that legitimately might just be a sign of burnout. And saying that its a result of gaming being \"mainstream\" when using Halo 3 as a positive example (the biggest entertainment launch of all time at that point) is kinda hilarious.",

And I think plenty of people will remember jedi survivor considering the size of the IP and the high likelyhood of the series continuing in the future but that's neither here nor there I suppose.\n\nThe point of all these games being from \"old IPs\" is a nothing burger aswell, it has no impact on the actual quality of the game and doesn't apply to several games on the list either.\n\nI'm not sure what you meant when you said you stand by the Halo 3 example. You said gaming is bad now because its mainstream but somehow Halo 3 is not bad despite being as mainstream as it gets? You say games are designed to appeal to the widest audience as if that was not in the minds of the Halo 3 designers at the time?\n\nYou can keep saying that AAA is at a low point but that doesn't magically make it true. Especially when your entire argument is \"businesses want to make money now\" and \"not enough new IP\". That doesn't confront the actual quality of the games I mentioned, which by all measures are all largely positively recieved. I suppose you might personally think they're all bad but I'd be lying if I said that's an honest assessment by even the most cynical lens.\n\nI think we're not going to agree here and that's fine. I also have an appreciation for a lot of older games but I would be lying if many times my experience going back wasnt one of realising how much we've improved in quality of life features and such. All I would say to keep an eye out because I'm sure there's some modern stuff that will appeal to you aswell",

But I also think gaming is better than ever, in the spaces I play. RPGs, in particular, have generally been getting better and better, with better mechanics and stories, and less filler. I recently played the pixel remaster of FFV, with the 4x experience mod on, and took out all the grinding. That took a 30-40 hour game originally down to a brisk 15.",

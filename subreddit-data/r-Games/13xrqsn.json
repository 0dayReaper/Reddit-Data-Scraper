It's such a meaningless criticism. Same with \"boring\" because all that tells me is that they don't find it interesting but often people don't expound on it, so it's equally uninformative.\n\nCombat aside, FFXVI is as classic FF as FF gets, it's primo medieval fantasy material. Though in FFI we originally fought Tiamat on a space station so the series has often been more than just that anyways.",

It's Sony exclusive, so already you're going to have bad actors who want to tear the game down so that Xbox is on top (note: I think console \"wars\" are stupid both ways, and a good game is a good game -- I'll play Xbox, PS, Nintendo, PC, whatever) \n\n2. Many people's last game was FFXV, which, while charming, was very flawed, unfinished, and underdelivered on a lot of promises. Many people don't play FFXIV, so they have no way of knowing what CBU3's FF games are like and how the team usually delivers a quality product.\n\n3. Die-hard FF \"fans\" are upset by the changes XVI is making to the formula, even tho I kind of scratch my head at this as someone who's played every FF game except 11. FF is about shaking up the formula. It's never confined itself that much.\n\n4. While games like Devil May Cry are considered classics and critical successes, the gaming audience at large doesn't care for character-action games all that much.\n\n5. FFXVI's recent marketing has been pretty overwhelming. Some people might feel annoyed or fatigued.",

Role Playing Game - there are very few games where you're not playing a specific role in the game.\n\nAdditionally, RPGs aren't bound to the turn-based format by any extent.  Diablo, for example, is an RPG of the hack-n-slash variety.  Kingdom Hearts is an RPG, with stats and character progression.  FF16 is basically an extension of Kingdom Hearts' approach to that type of RPG, but as a serious and non-convoluted approach.\n\nHell, Final Fantasy hasn't had a turn-based game in *over 20 years*.  Yeah, go check the date on when FF10 was released - that was 20 years, now you feel old.  FF12 wasn't turn-based.  13 wasn't turn-based.  These used variations of the Active Time Gauge that 4 introduced, which is still persistent in the series in other variations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know not everyone is down for the Spectacle Fighter approach that FF16 is taking, but it is very inaccurate and shitty to call it not a RPG.",

They also had the stupid action spinoff to work with in Strangers of Paradise if people really need to get all button mashing sweaty. I cannot begin to fathom why the fuck Yoshi thought this was the direction to take the core series in.\n\nI think the music is amazing, as Soken always is. The story looks great, the world looks great, the character design is great. Everything gives me big Ivalice-esque vibes which is as good as you can get with FF, imo.\n\nThe non-Eikon gameplay? It looks awful. I couldn't be less interested. The saddest thing still is, I *do* think the gameplay we've seen of Ifrit looks pretty baller, and I think it would be an awesome way to mix up standard strategic RPG-esque gameplay, but no. We got fucking \"Clive May Cry\".",

How the fuck would Yoshi P get them to make FF16's combat system??\n\n2. If the combat director of dragon's dogma is available to make your combat system, you hire them on the spot.  He's the best in the business at making action RPGs.\n\n3. It's always been an RPG.  You have equipment, upgrades, levels, accessories.  You unlock skills that you can upgrade.  Finally you can fully customize your build to have 3 of 7 eikons and 6 of 21 skills.  Thats an action RPG.",

It reduces how much crap a team must fight with to make the game. And in turn, that makes the final price tag much lower, since they have less dicking around. \n\n\nThen, porting it later, after the initial sales have been made, means a larger budget to work with on the port, as well as time to actually work on it (and hopefully run well on release, which is an issue often).\n\nAnd if the game sold like crap, at least they won't waste their time porting.",

The whole idea is that the boss has more health incentivising you to go for stronger longer combos which leave you vulnerable to its hits. Otherwise since there's no stamina cost for the dodges it's way too easy to just never take damage if your 100% focused on dodging.",

However what a lot of these games get wrong is that in Sekiro the stagger gauge essentially allows you to mow down enemies if you're good at the combat, whereas in a lot of these newer games the stagger gauge acts like just another health bar that you have to whittle down before you can do any actual damage, so the enemies end up spongy anyway. \n\nLike seriously in this fight what difference would it make if instead of having that stagger bar the boss just had one giant health bar? I don't feel like anything would've changed.",

Recently I've noticed more and more games use a sort of stagger/poise meter (this isn't really related to FF16 in particular I just thought about it when watching this video). Although I would bet that a decent number of games have took inspiration from Sekiro's combat.\n\n\n2. Not many games use their stagger meters to improve the combat experience like Sekiro did. I'm not trying to say that FF16 or FF7R got it from Sekiro I'm just saying that at least from playing FF7R and from watching this I don't think the stagger mechanics are particularly good in either game and I wish they worked differently.",

They want to give you big fancy long animation attacks that can be chained in long combos to look cool and do crazy damage but also want bosses to not have to wait forever between thier attacks so you can actually use them. Being able to stagger the boss is a good way to do this. Dmc 5 also has a hidden stagger for bosses but you just don't get any indicator it's going to happen, it just randomly does after you deal enough burst. Adding a visual tracker just makes it so that you can plan your cooldowns around it.\n\nEdit: it also is there to give the long battles more of a back and forth. It makes them feel more like your on the backfoot trying to get in whatever licks you can for most of the fight while other times you have the advantage and are pressuring them hard.",

I know people have been arguing about FF should be action or turn-based, but personally the Job System or it's equivalent is what defines and differentiates the series from other RPGs.\n\nEven Strangers of Paradise managed to blend action-based gameplay with a Job System attached to it.",

If you don't like devil may cry there is a high chance you won't like the gameplay in this one. You can always use the ez mode trinkets to ignore the gameplay if the story looks interesting though.",

For me, Half Life 1 was my third ever FPS, with only Dark Forces and Jedi Knight preceding it, and I played both of those all the way through with invincibility and infinite ammo cheat codes, on easy. So HL1's weird, fast, and aggressive aliens in a realistic environment was scary. If I had a few years of real FPS experience beforehand I'd probably have felt differently.",

I don't recall many FPS games giving me the spooks, even FEAR wasn't the spookfest it was touted to be - Condemned 2 comes to mind as the scariest FPS experience I've had, fuck that hobo brawlin' game.\n\nI do remember the first game that scared me enough that I never touched the damn thing again - My mom got a bunch of games from a co-worker who was getting rid of his stuff back in the early 90s. One of the games came with a barely touched strategy guide, huh cool!\n\nFuckin' Diablo 1. Funny to think of now cause you look at it and go \"really?\", but damn that game's atmosphere and music were built to terrify. I didn't play that shit until D2 came out and I was in high school lol.",

Even compared to System Shock 2 the first game was very obtuse to play, it was made in that era where developers were still working out how a first-person game should play. So taking most of the original design and adding a few modern sensibilities lets people experience the *authentic* ideas and designs without being *too* inconvenienced. \n\nBut at the same time a number of elements they've maintained feel rather dated too. I don't think the map or level design translates very well to modern sensibilities, for example. The space station doesn't feel like an actual space station, it feels like a video game level (again something common in level design at the time, games were still navigating whether they should represent actual spaces or more explicitly 'video game' levels). It almost feels like walking around a player made base in a survival game. I'm struggling to find a screenshot that really shows it, but ones like [this](https://imgur.com/a/e0k15rR) kinda get the point across. The limited number of 'tiles' which make up the spaces makes them feel artificial. And that becomes especially noticeable with modern day graphics rather than 1994 graphics. \n\nIt'll work for some people, it won't work for others, but honestly I'm not sure the game offers *all* that much to people who weren't already fans of the 1994 original.",

When you just watch SS it gives one vibe but when you're playing it it doesn't feel like its a generic tileset. And a big part of that, imo, is that when you are playing you are keyed up and interacting with the environment in a way you just can't be if you aren't playing.",

Can make for a cozy weekend if that sort of dungeon crawling is your idea of a good time. Another good comparison might be Legend of Grimrock. Just don't confuse this for a shooter or you'll be disappointed. \n\nI'm a bit lost on your points about the tiling which is a style very specifically limited to the opening medical level (it's supposed be reminiscent of the cramped tiling of both real hospitals and real space stations)",

Real spaces aren't built up like this. Now back in 1994 this was because of technical limitations, and players could generally be expected to use their imagination to overlook those limitations. But it's not 1994 any more. By modern standards the spaces feel incredibly blocky and uniform, as if you're walking through someone's Fortnite build. \n\nCompare it to, say, the level design in [Prey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcUxPc3FrT4), the closest thing we've got to System Shock 3. Prey has much greater variety in room size, in room *height*, in sight lines. It feels like a more useable *space*, not a video game level. \n\nNow if System Shock remake's level design scratches a certain itch then there's nothing wrong with that. But you can't deny it's a very *dated* itch, and there's a reason why so few games replicate that sort of level design today. I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of the most praise-filled reviews reference the reviewer playing and being familiar with the original game.",

Now, of course that's handwaving to justify the weaknesses of the original game's layout limitations, but it also explains why some of the levels don't feel like they're laid out in an expected or standard form - they've been (presumably) altered from their original design.\n\nI'm only tangentially familiar with the original game - I never got off Medical in SS1, even though I beat SS2. IMO, what they've done is successfully modernize a truly ancient game and bring forward the same tension and atmosphere that the original game had. They should, by rights, be pretty proud of themselves - doubly so if they're getting praise from the sorts of players of the original game who actually finished it 'back in the day'.",

The Unity Engine demo they released with the 2016 Kickstarter showcased this.\n\nAbout a year later, after the project had moved to Unreal Engine, Night Dive started showing off completely unrecognizable level design and talked about how they decided to make new maps based off modern conventions.\n\nA lot of people complained, some people were thrilled, but regardless Night Dive continued forward. They didn't scrap that plan and return to the original plan until they realized they couldn't get any publisher to pick up the project to provide the extra funding they would need.",

The vault dweller only finds better weapons and items by divulging deeper into dangerous areas that others had missed, taking them off the bodies of enemies that were better established, or by purchasing them from places that had managed to concentrated them(typically tho violence and were no longer bandits-gun runners for example). Everything else was barren and picked clean.\n\nVerses the two games afterwards where they used scripts to autogenerate what items were in any structure that functioned as a box. Fallout 3 and NV take place 200 years after the bombs dropped, but I was guaranteed to find stim paks and whole cartoons of cigarettes in trashcans behind every third person's house and the trashcans of the hotel that people had been habituating for decades. The really obvious children's school, office building, or train station right outside town would have a simple locked door with nothing stolen since the bombs dropped. The safe would still be in tack with its contents while also finding a working firearm or melee weapon in still good condition. Did I mention I would find tons of fresh edible food?

The level design is going to appeal to people who like to solve cosy dungeons, whether or not they have played the original. \n\nThe design here is not some bygone inferior wisdom. SS1's level design is surprisingly fair and sensible even when compared to many modern dungeon crawlers. It gives you that moody sense of dread and claustrophobia of Dark Souls 1, but without the insane difficulty or the insta-death traps.\n\nYou seem to be struct by the classic target demographic illusion of \"objectivity\". Where you recognize that you are not the target demographic for something and subsequently conclude that the devs are objectively wrong for not catering to your needs. \n\nPrey is a great game, but it's a pretty poor dungeon crawler, and so adopting it's architectural design would be a bad choice for a SS1 remake. Plus Prey didn't sell very well, remember, so it's not like it's level design style is some moneybag slam dunk.",

I imagine most people are approaching it from that angle and not as a 'dungeon crawler'. In fact if you look on the Steam page of both the original System Shock and the remake, both have 'immersive sim' as one of the tags but not 'dungeon crawler'. \n\nLike I get the argument you're making, back when System Shock was made Doom was only a year old and most 'first person' games would have been these grid-based dungeon crawlers.

It's certainly not survival horror because resource management is not nearly as tense as you'd expect of the genre.\n\nOf course, it has a lot of action elements but it's not fast or flashy; compare it against any 'action game' and it will be laughably weak. It's not a 'DOOM clone'. \n\nIt is often referred to as an RPG despite having none of the trappings of an RPG, except for the dungeon-crawling experience the level design creates.\n\nThe game is driven by exploration and half the challenge is in figuring out what to do next. This is more descriptive of an adventure game than anything else.\n\n---\n\nI admit action-adventure is not the typical way of describing SS1.",

The space station doesn't feel like an actual space station, it feels like a video game level (again something common in level design at the time, games were still navigating whether they should represent actual spaces or more explicitly 'video game' levels).\n\nThe developers copied level design from roguelikes at the time because it fit into the space station aesthetic (cramped, small spaces everywhere). The mazes were purposeful as it is intended to be a dungeon in space with traps, ambushes, and lots of hidden cavities/spaces. Random rooms with some environmental story telling.\n\nI'm curious to see what design elements were kept from the original game. I know the levels are supposedly the same maze layout. Did they keep all the rooms that were empty or had environmental hazards? Respawning enemies kept? Did they keep the respawning enemy factories in the levels that were shutdown able? Very much looking forward to this game.",

Wife's a huge series fan and literally the only negative she has to give it is they took away the upbeat music, and I can say that's the least contentious change as the quieter themes seem to fit the atmosphere better. When it shines, it does shine, I helped her earlier skip having to find a secret/remote button by completely ignoring it and just using an EMP grenade to temporarily disable some upwards fans.\n\nBut I can see the game being super annoying for newcomers. Like, it doesn't tell you things such as \"write down the numbers on the displays near the respawn machine, you might need them\", which you may think is obvious to do, but it's definitely not typical of this era. If people quit Hollow Knight and miss the superb game over being lost, they'll quit this just as much.\n\nI saw a review by the channel Nick930 showing differences between the original and the new one and it seemed to highlight well what was done for preserving the feel, and what was done for modernizing, and the game leans way more heavily on the former.\n\nI can understand Stephen Kick's thoughts in the article. There's certainly a certain amount of risk attached to the game's release and reception. I think it warrants success from what I've seen, but it may be a tad bit of a hard sell for those not in the know of it. It's not just a simple \"come see where Bioshock came from\" sell.",

Go slow, take your time, look around carefully, and you'll do fine - the moment you look at thing #1 and then move on is the moment that thing #2 was sitting right next to it.\n\n(In my case, it was a corpse, right in front of the console where the shard was sitting - I can almost 'remember' searching it and moving on without looking around, and it bit me.)",

                    "comment": "Pretty good, IMO. Now I should note: This is a remake in the \"this game absolutely pulls no punches - it's just like the original\" vein. It won't outright  tell you how to solve the \"quest puzzles\" and the solutions to some of these are NOT immediately obvious or apparent. Some of the \"quest puzzles\" contain \"you fucked up\" anti-solutions. (Don't just run around flipping switches on marked consoles just because there's a switch and you made it to the switch!) \n\nIf you don't want to sweat in your brain pan, this isn't a game for you without a walkthrough.\n\n**If you played Bioshock:**\n\nMuch more survival horror here. Resources are not nearly so plentiful. Small inventory means carefully selecting what you take and when, and finding a place to leave things you may want to come back for.\n\n**If you played SS2:**\n\nThe remake is much more of a survival horror than SS2 ever was. SS2 felt *much* smaller by comparison. Resources matter, using them smartly matters. I like it, but I suspect that it's going to feel a little \"hard\" by the lights of more casual players of modern games, and if SS2 was my only comparison, it's notably harder.\n\n**If you played SS1:**\n\nThis is a trip down memory lane for you. Keycodes are different but having run through a few decks (and then compared to walkthrough of original) it seems to be a nearly-100% faithful remake. If you wanted to try the first one and stumbled over the controls and graphics, this might be a good one to look at.\n\n**By the Parts:**\n\n* Combat\n\nCombat is smooth and fluid. Get some mileage out of that Sparqbeam, you're going to need it. Melee combat works, but since so many of the robots and other foes explode, it's hard to get much mileage out of that laser rapier (at least so far). Recovery resources are not without cost/limits, so retreating to recovery areas (surgery benches/recharge stations) is often preferable.\n\n* Cyberspace\n\nSmooth, but not always easy. I am slightly dreading later areas - some of the early ones have been a challenge in places! If you're playing on Diff3 for Cyberspace, get ready to protect your brain, and save before entering cyberspace. The ambush-style nature of the arenas in this can be overwhelming.\n\n* Puzzles (Grid/Hacking)\n\nIf you've done pipe-hacking in Bioshock, or grid hacking in SS2, you're not going to have any real trouble here once you figure out how these work. There's not a large number of them - no more than a handful per deck, and there are a couple of variant types, so they never really wear out their welcome (like pipe-hacks in Bioshock did).\n\n* Puzzles (Story/Quest)\n\nPay attention. It's easy to overlook data shards, or voice logs, and there are not duplicates to help you out if you overlook the ONE item that has the code you need or the instructions on how to resolve the current 'quest'. This is not a game to blitz unless you know exactly what you're doing.\n\n**On the whole:**\n\nI'm happy I spent the money, it seems like a good buy so far - though it is definitely not on the easy end of the spectrum. It hails from a different era, and although the controls are smoother and the graphics easier on the eyes, it retains its original pedigree in all the aspects I can see. Variable difficulty allows the player to precisely customize what they're looking for in the game - harder or easier combat, puzzles, quest-timers, the whole Shodan-bang is on display.\n\n[Would recommend to all fellow insects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGEjKoGHzO0&amp;t=542s)",

Alpha strain mutants on the maintenance deck? Same problem - I'd love to save some ammo, but they blow up and contaminate you (assuming you don't get goo'd in the face).\n\nI haven't tried it with the security bots, but I'd expect similar.

No huge open worlds with meaningless filler quests. The atmosphere and aesthetics are fantastic. And the combat actually feels reasonably satisfying.

Its atmosphere however was second to none, and I assume that's what people are caught up with - you won't announce every step of the way to the public if your hair stands on end on each corner. It's some \"Me\" time, in the best and the worst way.",

(And you still get some of that - it'll kick in during combat, just like your adrenaline.)",

This definitely feels like the former, even if they're using the original game as a stand upon which to begin their ascent. If it retains that feel throughout the remainder I have not yet seen, then they will have earned their kudos, and I will hope they make their money!",

Sure, but then you have weapons like the ARWEN 37, which is a riot gun, but not a shotgun, firing rubber slugs.

But Night Dive has intentionally made significant changes to the atmosphere and to the gameplay mechanics for the purpose of making it a survival horror game, which the original was not.\n\nIn the original, you could carry seven(!) weapons at any given moment. In the remake, the new grid-based inventory makes that impossible. In fact it creates a much larger focus on inventory management than in the original.\n\nThe loot economy is significantly changed as well, largely due to the addition of the recycler and the vending machines. Enemies respawn more frequently than the original, and it's higher-tier enemies respawning too, and it appears that they drop less items on them. Which means you're using supplies more frequently and finding them less frequently. The vending machine is an essential part of the remake, and this means that gathering junk items for the recycler for credits is also an essential part.\n\nSystem Shock 2023 is a survival horror game. System Shock 1994 was not. In 2016, Stephen Kick called the original \"adventure horror\", and said he wanted to change that in the remake. And he did.\n\n&gt; A riot gun and a shotgun are not automatically the same thing. The original game had the riot gun, this game has a shotgun. Can a shotgun be used as a riot gun? Yes.\n\nThe riot gun in SS1 was a shotgun using rubber slugs.\n\n&gt; On the subject of non-lethal options, I do not remember them having an impact on the game, at all. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m open to hearing how.\n\nNon-lethal was not much use in the original; it just wasn't balanced for it. Night Dive could have improved the viability of non-lethal playthroughs, but instead scrapped them entirely. When you say they added more practical options, it simply doesn't make sense.",

Quicksave and manual save are highly recommended. (Additionally, there's a respawn mechanic, but you need to activate that yourself in-game.)",

I was very surprised that this game was coming out so I picked it up immediately. \n\nIt's the same game I played last year, but 100 times better with the controls. It still retains that spot for a unique survival horror game, I mean I'm afraid at times. \n\nGive it a shot. It's probably worth your money, or you could watch it on a play through on YouTube or pirate the game if you aren't willing to part with cash. Short answer is I love it. \u2764\ufe0f",

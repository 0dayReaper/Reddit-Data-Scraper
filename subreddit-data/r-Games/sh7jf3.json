It was a bit too much American corporate culture for my taste. Which really sticks out in Sweden. And there were some frustrating moments with crunch and being forced to make a game built around loot boxes when none of us wanted them. But overall it was actually a really good place to work. Good pay, good benefits, very fun competent people.",

For example, Bioware dropped all the Online Service features that EA was originally going to force onto Dragon Age 4, which is a win for everyone involved.  Or not forcing Respawn to make games they don't want to tackle.\n\nOf course, I'm working on memory here, so take it with a grain of salt.

It was amazing to get such a powerful, polished official tool from the devs in 1996.\n\nHonestly it really spoiled console shooters for me at the time. The obsession to get \"full 3D\" at the cost of janky slideshow framerate and constant fog in games like Turok and Goldeneye seemed really silly compared to the performance, mouse &amp; keyboard control, and custom content possibilities of Marathon at mere cost of 2.5D graphics.",

It evolved into a lot of the Halo stuff eventually, but for a mid-90s game it was super complicated, and due to the limitations of the tech back then, it was told primarily through text readouts at consoles that you would find in the game. I'm on my phone and don't have time to look for it now, but a few years ago I came across a website that had all of the console text from the series in an organized system, and it was a pretty interesting read through.",

                    "comment": "The press release they did seems way more explicit than anything Microsoft has ever said that they intend to keep all bungie games content multi platform. \n\n\nOne theory I have heard that I find find compelling is that this is a multi media play by Sony\n\nEdit; https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50988\n\n&gt; We remain in charge of our destiny. We will continue to independently publish and creatively develop our games. We will continue to drive one, unified Bungie community. Our games will continue to be where our community is, wherever they choose to play\n\nThey also said explicitly in an FAQ all current and future bungie titles will be fully multi platform\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alsowoodie/status/1488214605365055488?t=EP-6GvDyABmfccO7FNxeVw&amp;s=19",

It\u2019s also risky to be an independent publisher with a single game, on the verge of releasing something new. If that new project was to flop, that could end up being the death of the studio. \n\nBased on the statement by Sony, it sounds like Bungie games will continue to be cross platform and that Bungie will operate completely independently from the rest of PlayStation Studios. \n\nI could totally see this being a win for Bungie if they are allowed to operate independently, and get QA support from Sony in addition to the financial stability required to launch a new IP with decreased risk.\n\nWhether is actually turns out like this, we shall see",

Zork, and Hexen and all the old mostly irrelevant shit adds up to max one Bungie.\n\nThat adds up to 17 Bungies worth of my arbitrary point system, so pretty close, and I'd be willing to pay more for a bulk buy if I were Microsoft.",

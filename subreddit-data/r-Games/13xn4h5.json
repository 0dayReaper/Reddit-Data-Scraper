I know we say it every year but it feels more and more like PCVR is dead outside of the occasional niche enthusiast release or continued support for the handful of big names already on PC.  My Rift S is gathering dust lol \ud83d\ude22",

I was hoping that would keep up, but it seems like publisher support for PCVR really is winding down.  Definitely a better value proposition to spend \\~$400 and have a VR-ready setup, so I do get it!",

            "comment": "Gameplay trailer on the Steam page actually reminds me a bit of Post Void? The short timer that replenishes on kills seems to have a similar role to the liquid draining out of your skull, and in both cases the thing showing how long you\u2019ve got left is held in your left hand. Plus the slide seems to have a similar feel.\n\nObviously not as hectic and seemingly a bit more complicated with combos and melee but still seems like it might be inspired by it",

They're not for everyone, I don't blame someone for being disappointed at finding out a game they think looks cool is a Roguelite, but complaining they want something right and focused is an odd response.",

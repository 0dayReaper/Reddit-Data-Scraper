Tbh aside from the discussion about AI and art, the sole purpose of artstation is a place where artist can present there portfolio. AI director aren't artists and can't do shit without AI. Moreover it is still very unclear how copyright is applied here hence no big companies hires anyone who only can do AI generation there are to many things to do that can't be done easily with AI generation besides the undefined interpretation of the law here.",

Even if you don't care or have a problem with the ethical issues of AI art generators in general, its use has so far been largely categorized by people selling images created in this way while lying about their provenance and then doubling down even when caught.  If AI-generated imagery is so great and good-looking and has no ethical issues, why are so many people lying about using it instead of trying to legitimize it by saying \"yeah, I made this cool thing using an AI generator\"?  If companies are so eager to use and legitimize AI-generated imagery, why aren't they deliberately seeking it out and then hyping it up when they use it, instead of pretending like it doesn't exist when they get criticized for it?  It's almost like all the alarms sounded about this shit from the start were actually valid, and all the critics have been proven right.  \n\nI guess if people don't care that they're constantly being lied to about the use of AI generators (see: the fact that images generated this way has completely overrun sites like Adobe Stock and the sellers/creators tag them as \"illustrations\" etc instead of as AI generated), then this isn't a big deal, so uh...enjoy, I guess?  But the rest of us are rightly concerned about the rise of an entire new industry built on dishonesty and gaslighting.  We have enough of that shit already, we don't need otherwise cool tech being deliberately and aggressively used to make more of that shit.",

Anything these tools are scraping was uploaded to the internet for the world to see. If anyone has been able to demonstrate that one of these models was somehow training on private images from personal devices that were never publicly posted, that would be a gross invasion of privacy, but AFAIK that hasn't happened.\n\nYou talk about dystopias and corporate monopolization of art. But right now, we're on the path that avoids that. Anyone can use these tools; the barrier to entry is the lowest it's ever been. In a world where the tools can only use training data that they specifically paid for a license to, and could not train on the massive amount of freely available public images online, then the technology wouldn't go away - it would just mean that everyday artists using free models would take a nosedive in quality, and the only ones who could afford to benefit from the cutting-edge models would be the megacorporations who could afford to spend millions on purchasing training data.",

Art historically has been a very expensive profession, that\u2019s why today we have so many stories of great artists whose work has become iconic that only became famous after their death, and how they lived their lives in poverty.\n\nAnd an artist\u2019s job is difficult, that\u2019s what makes them cost so much. But literally every other manual job has been enhanced  technologically to cut costs. Look around your house, everything was made by machines. The easier they are to make, the less they cost, and as such, the more you are going to buy from it. (Well, as principle at least, for the sake of the argument, let\u2019s not complicate the example with selling names, which is what brands do). \n\nYet, we are living in the golden age of manual works as a hobby. People still sew and knit by hand as a hobby today, and even though many even sell their custom creations on social media to make some money, majority of them do it for fun. They are happy to work for fun. \n\nImagine now the people who have to sew and knit by hand from dawn to dusk in a sweatshop of 1000 others. People complain that the work culture was different in [insert idealized past year here] and never really think what else we have offset by making these changes. How about physical health? \n\nFrom my personal experience, 90% of all 40-something year olds who need government aid to survive are those who do manual work today and manual work used to be the norm for most of human history. It\u2019s not car crashes or anything like it that\u2019s making people disabled in large numbers, but manual work. People get weaker over the years after a certain age, but manual work will age you faster. \n\nLet art be a healing hobby for people like sewing and knitting is today, not a way to pay your bills.",

I am not against machine learning in principle, but the manner in which it has been unethically taught and the purpose it will serve in *directly* punishing those whom it birthed from. There's a sick irony that the people who's livelihoods will be erased will have that erasure executed by a machine who's very existence is utterly dependent on their own work.\n\nIn a lot of senses it's literally represented by the \"[I made this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/079/173/ed2.png)\" meme.\n\nThere's a *lot* standing in the way of present day and the star trek post-scarcity utopia many people want, and even in fiction there was a fair bit of struggle before they got to that point. We need to be extremely conscientious of the effect technological leaps will have on the lives of millions of people and the small handful of people and organizations who will ultimately control and benefit from these leaps. And as I've said elsewhere, the current machine learning that is open source will not hold a candle to the programs being developed with the billions of dollars of backing from companies like Google or Microsoft.",

The entire professions disappeared in the course of human history. That's normal. No, \"creative professions\" are no different.\n\nYou cry about AI but ignore digital art tools creating overabundance of art by massively decreasing cost, time and skill it takes to produce a high quality art piece.\n\nArtists have two options, really. Either ride the wave by adopting this new tool that increases their productivity even more (which leads to even more high quality art that benefits *everyone* except shitty artists), or go the way of luddites and try to fight against the progress to eventually fail and fall to obscurity. Well, smart artist have already made the choice.",

It's like, you're looking at a tool that is going to lower the barrier to entry for creators in certain fields (like game dev) to almost nothing, and it's going to make artists and creators like 10x more productive. In general it's going to be this monumental boon to humanity in so many ways.\n\nBut because of capitalism we need to fixate on ownership rights and who loses out. I think we need to just implement an AI UBI like some people suggest. Rather than bogging down these innovations with endless IP arbitration, just throw everyone a bone and say that we all in some way probably contributed to the creation of one AI model or another (didn't ChatGPT use some reddit posts?), and so we all deserve a piece of the pie.",

But because accuracy is not on the horizon for generative AI text, both *you* and *I* are ultimately going to be liable for any mistakes that slip through because two LLMs took its best statistical guess on how sentences should be formed. Our managers certainly won't feel the heat.\n\nThe time that you and I will spend frantically trying to verify the information *that could have two dimensions of inaccuracies attached to them* will not be accounted for in our new productivity expectations. Anything that slips through will be held against us, and if we spend the time needed to keep errors from slipping through, we'll be falling behind.\n\nBoth of us are about to be in catastrophic no-win situations.\n\nThe first solution to both of us either falling behind or allowing errors will be to churn through candidates \"who can keep up.\" Any candidate who *can* keep up will have their productivity expectations revised upward until they can't.

You can generate a high res image that fixes smudging by having the generator generate the image in tiles. It looks the same as the original but because each tile is generated independently the finer details don't end up smugged. My GPU ran out of memory when I tried it so I can't do it.\n\nThis is different from the upscalers which will upscale the smudges.\n\nWe don't hear about perfect generated images because they take so much longer to make. You can give RNGesus the wheel and have it output an image every couple of seconds and once RNGesus blesses you with a good enough image you're done. To do a high quality image means setting the pose you want, waiting for a food image to pop out, doing the hires fix on it and hope that works, and then fixing any mistakes that still make it through. Some to further and make numerous images and then put them together in Photoshop.",

Most people are not artists, so minor flaws are far less evident than true artists think.\nThe rhetoric is that AI art isn't good, but is also somehow a threat to artists globally. If it's not good, why is anybody worried?",

If we all just accepted this as \"good enough\", the motivation for making it better would be less pressing, and thus progress slower.\n\nSure, but I don't really think that's what most people are doing with their critiques that are focused on projecting today's level of AI image generation into the future. Even you just said yourself that we'd likely still develop without people pointing out the flaws, just not quite as fast.\n\nIf the argument was \"these are the current issues that need fixing\" then sure. But it's typically not. It's \"these are why the current issues mean it'll never be that good in the future.\" It's the projection of the status quo into the future that doesn't make any sense, as it's going to develop no matter what and the variable is speed, even if I agree that criticism does incentivize improvements.\n\nSo yeah I can see where you're coming from, but that doesn't mean you just have to accept arguments that make no sense, because some people are convinced by those nonsense arguments and will only find themselves deeper in the denial hole when it does in fact get a lot better.\n\n&gt;From a non-utilitarian perspective, art is communication. My little sisters mediocre crayon drawings are more valuable to me than an art exhibit because I care about the person who drew it. A robot capable of making infinite crayon drawings just isn't going to cut it for me. That's not to say AI art can't be used to make good art (this video is super cool imo), but enabling dull people to make dull art for middle managers who just want anything presentable isn't something I'm going to be enthused about.\n\nWhich is why you're never going to stop caring about your little sisters drawings, AI isn't threatening it in even a tiny little bit because the value there is the person behind it. That's never going to be replaced, it just allows for OTHER things to be created that otherwise wouldn't have been.\n\nBecause I agree, art is about communication. But what's being communicated is very broad - some things, such as that your little sister naturally means a lot to you, are focused on the human touch. Other things, such as \"here is a cover I made for a self published book I wrote\" are about communicating the themes of the book, and communicating to the potential audience that they might be interested in reading it.\n\nFor over a hundred years now, anyone who wants to write a novel has been able to write novels. Dull middle managers have written plenty of dull novels. So what? Other people write great novels using the same tools.\n\nAI art will likely be the same way - people will use it on a scene-by-scene basis to create art that wouldn't have existed before, and tons of it will be bad, and some of it will be great, and on aggregate more people having more tools to use art to communicate in unique ways (whether the intended communication is artistic or business-oriented) means more people will simply be empowered to do so.\n\nMost of everything artistic is boring and average, it'll be true here too, and it also won't particularly matter because tons of it won't be.",

That's never going to be replaced, it just allows for OTHER things to be created that otherwise wouldn't have been.\n\nThe issue comes from being able to tell the difference. It's incredibly easy in the context of said little sister, but a huge drag on a global scale. \n\nI have always enjoyed art because of the stories behind it, and have always tried to reach out to my favorite artists, learn more about them and support them. I have always been in awe of their skill, and up until last year I could be sure that every piece I see fits that criteria. \n\nHowever, I have zero interest in algorithmically generated drivel, and yet it's impossible to avoid it since it's everywhere, utterly disrespecting those boundaries. No watermark, no tag. I have to scrutinize everything if I want to enjoy art the way it matters to me. \n\n&gt; more people will simply be empowered to do so. \n\nA much more likely outcome is there will be *less* people creating. Once the majority are tired of the new toy - and they will be, the instant gratification of everybody being a DaVinci right off the bat never lasts  - you'll have a single prompt jockey replacing a hundred artists commercially, and that's it. Of course, some hobbyists will still exist, but much like with digital replacing analog, people will be demotivated to create in an \"inferior\" field. Music schools are mostly empty where I live already because synth is a thing, same will happen here. \n\nI assure you the cultural impact will be massive, and it'll be more akin to the Tiktok dumbification rather than art schools or photography making things accessible for everyone. But thankfully these things take new generations to grow up first, and you and I will not live to see it.",

Not every actor is Tom Cruise, and while those at the top get paid a disproportionate amount the bulk of the labor economy is represented by the simpler bread and butter, middle of the road artists. As a system in its infancy, \"passable\" will be fleeting in terms of technological progression speed. The AI Art most people are commenting on is already completely irrelevant to what machine learning is capable of because these were made with the \"era\" of machine learning algorithms still publicly available on the internet during this last spike in attention.\n\nThe machine learning that Google and other major organizations have been pumping billions of dollars into is decidedly *not* publicly available, and you can be assured that these private programs will not have these issues. The organization that wins that arms race wins a lot more than just the ability to draw hands, as well.\n\nThe discussion needs to be about ethically sourcing the training of machine learning programs, and digital privacy rights in general, because what is happening is: The stolen work of artists is being used to train the algorithms of machine learning programs that will ultimately be used to replace said artists with their own stolen works. This is dramatically more unethical then any other \"automation\" job replacement we have ever witnessed and it will only get worse as these programs find more roles they can assimilate and execute.",

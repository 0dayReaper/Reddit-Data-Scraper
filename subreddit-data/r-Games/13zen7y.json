It actually entered into force (or, was due to be implemented by EU members) last year, but I suppose it takes some time to convince Valve that they need to conform to it.\n\nThe relevant part here is Article 2, section 1:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.   Any announcement of a price reduction shall indicate the prior price applied by the trader for a determined period of time prior to the application of the price reduction.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.   The prior price means the lowest price applied by the trader during a period of time not shorter than 30 days prior to the application of the price reduction.\n\nI believe this is actually new in EU law for all retailers, not just online ones, although I've seen it on the national level in some places.",

The directive is meant to protect you from fake discounts: shitty Black Friday deals when they raise the price the week before only to announce a \"sale\" the week after, or products launching with \"50% off!\" label even though they were never actually sold for any higher price.\n\nBut it won't inform you about upcoming discounts. The best you can do with expensive games is check a price tracking website before you buy it, to see when and for how much it usually goes on sale. If it's the game's first sale though, you'll be out of luck.",

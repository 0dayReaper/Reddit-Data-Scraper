Stuff you consider solid today can legitimately just be gone tomorrow. \n\nIt's naive to think netflix is going out of business anytime soon, there's no direct indication of that. But it's just as naive to think they will definitely still be here in a decade. Especially given the financial situation the west finds itself in right now.",

Fostering the growth of a brand new dev team takes years even when veteran talent is brought on board. How many high profile misfired have we already seen when an untested group of developers are thrown together and given a huge budget and a mandate to put out a AAA game?\n\nAmazon has managed to put out a few games, but really only one has gained any sort of traction. Doesn't help that these tech companies are operating at the whims of their shareholders, who are probably even less understanding of the rigors of game development than traditional publishers (who still need to meet quarterly demands).",

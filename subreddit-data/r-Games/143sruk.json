I still haven't played those much more than about 10 minutes.\n\nIt hasn't felt like that. Cover is an important part of this game so it feels like it carries risk and isn't just me standing around shooting. It isn't like the quick ttk mp games, but it feels right. The environment is incredible. Very diverse in it's design. Has a nice recent post apocalyptic feel.\n\nI picked it up on a free weekend and enjoyed it. It's a nice change of pace for me. Bought it after.\n\nBoss and mini boss type enemies have more health..enemies have weak spots. It's more that grunts just keep coming.\n\nStill haven't tried the other bullet sponge games, but this felt good and fun.",

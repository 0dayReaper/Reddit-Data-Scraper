            "comment": "Arcade Paradise was great but, ironically, I wish it had *more* of a focus on the laundry/arcade management stuff and less on the arcade games themselves. They're great, but not nearly as compelling as maximizing your layout or finding the right balance between the laundry and arcade to still be profitable.",

Partially because I was never able to figure out if there was a way to play the games on their own without being tied into the meta gameplay.",

I played it for a week or so and was really disappointed all around.\n\nThe management options were nearly nonexistent. It even outright tells you what the optimal balance between cost and difficulty per game will be. You have very little control over the look and layout of your arcade. Every 'day' in game is just the same set of chores, over and over, with no real variation.\n\nAnd worst of all, the various arcade games were mediocre at *best* and many of them were downright terrible. The devs clearly went for quantity over quality, and the result was that the game's big draw wasn't even that fun because every single game was just a redo of a much better IRL game.\n\nI feel like the entire package just rides on its vibe and 90s nostalgia.",

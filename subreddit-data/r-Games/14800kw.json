            "comment": "I guess I'll be the one to spew basic opinions.\n\nIt really is a shame that in modern years games like D4 can sell so incredibly well and yet it's never enough for execs, and so the game has to be riddled with micro-transactions. Yes I understand that this was likely not a cheap game to make (believe me I've seen the art book, my mind cannot begin to comprehend the absurdity of what the art team went through to make this game come to life), and yes I understand that the time since D3 came out is going to do a lot for D4 sale numbers so it's not like Blizzard can repeat this trick every year.\n\nAnd yet, the game has raked in well over half a billion dollars within 5 days of launch. It's going to get some DLC and rake in a bit more. The game retailed for US$70. The most expensive game ever to develop reportedly (*excluding marketing cost*), SWTOR, had a US$200 million budget (US$270 million today, again excluding marketing) so if D4's development cost was higher than that, they haven't exactly advertised it - meaning this game has churned out *at least* over US$400 million *in profit* if not well more. In 5 days of launch! It'll probably sell more before the DLC! And again, this is profit - you can't die on some hill that \"Oh the developers gotta eat\". They've been paid and the money has been made back. Activision Blizzard also just got *hundreds of millions* on top of that.\n\nI really do wish there were more games in the past few years that were selling this well without the producers forcing a cash shop onto the finished product. If you're going to hike up the price by like 17%, you don't also need to nickel and dime players every step of the way. The only saving grace for D4 is its pay-walled content isn't particularly appealing for me as an individual, but I wish it wasn't such a stain on what is otherwise a great product.",

It's at the tail end of a menu you rarely use. You are never prompted or directed to it in the game. \n\nPersonally I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with making a game have the potential to be a constant revenue source, especially in Diablo which has seasons and constant development.",

Why those armors can't be in-game as drops because for some people how the character looks is important. And paying 70 euro for an entry, then to see a better looking set in shop will suck. Or having just 5 different sets for a class as in-game drops also SUCKS, especially when you'll repeat playing the game so many times. (the number is just an example). \n\nFor example, I care about how my character looks, and when I get a legendary drop I immediately look if it's cool, what colors it has, design and so on. So I'd rather have more in-game drops than a shop. Yea the game may be fine now, but the shop will only get bigger while the new armors for in-game drops will be fewer and fewer. \n\nWhy do people feel the need to defend this shit like \"ohh I don't care about the mtx, the game's good\". You can still say that the game is good, but having those mtx there is completely bullshit in a fully priced game. Especially 20euro + skins. \n\nFor some people it effects their fun with the game. For me it does. It is ok that for you or others it doesn't, but that doesn't make it ok.",

Taxes is going to take another 30% off those numbers when you take in the global level of sales. \n\nEvery day that someone plays, costs Blizzard money, in bandwidth and infrastructure. They don't charge a subscription, so they need to either front load the revenue to cover that, or add the microtransactions. \n\nThe issue is, most people just can't comprehend the scale of these games, and the costs that go into it.

Marketing nowadays almost always costs more than development, especially for AAA titles. RDD2 having a $300 million set aside for marketing wouldn't be weird at all. \n\nSo with taking inflation into account, it's very possible SWTOR is still the most expensive. That said, Star Citizen beats all of these titles and it's not even out yet(and probably won't ever be).",

Diablo 4 is live service game that is supposed to provide you with free content regularly. There is a big difference, don't you think?\n\nThe problem with live service games arises when the base game is not worth the full price and developer \"promises\" you that it will get better alongside having microtransactions. This imo happened to Dark Tide and that's why it had so lukewarm reception. For me Diablo 4 as it is now is worth 70$. Now we will see if Blizzard will keep their promise about new content and their microtransactions being cosmetics only.",

But live service game done right provide equal exchange. Players get new content and developer get money from it. Everybody wins in this situation if it's done right (no pay to win, cosmetics only). Diablo 3 got stale after RoS because Blizzard didn't provide new content since they have no microstansactions and it wasn't sustainable for them.",

For some reason, the gaming world has accepted that as ok since they have one specific abbreviation called MMO. But Diablo having another abbreviation not only does NOT ask you to pay monthly, it has one of the least intrusive cosmetics shops Ive ever seen. \n\nIt is a perpetually updated game, with new content being delivered every 3 months. If this is enough to pay monthly for a MMO, it should be enough to pay monthly for a ARPG. Yet, D4 doesnt ask you to pay monthly. I also play FF14 but Im frankly getting sick and tired of this bullshit narrative that ATVI somehow is more predatory than any other big publisher when in fact if they could all do it they would do it. Many of them with a more obnoxious monetization/cosmetics solution than D4.\n\nWe have got to collectively calm down with the panicky pitchfork waving regarding D4 because its monetization really is not shitty or intrusive. I would suggest you play the game for a while and you\u2019ll see for yourself.",

And Starfield is seen as unacceptable because it's a locked 30fps even though the scope of the game is like nothing weve seen before\n* As you say, some live service games or multiplayer games getting a pass on crazy monetisation whereas others doing the same thing are torn apart. Valve gets a massive pass in this area\n* Ubisoft gets torn apart in every thread about their games for their formulaic approach, but Sony gets praised for games like GoT and Horizon which are almost the exact same approach to game design. If those games were published by Ubisoft I'm confident they wouldn't be viewed as highly on here as they are\n* Sony having an effective monopoly on the console market isn't seen as an issue, but Microsoft buying companies to try to compete (even though they'd be still far smaller than Sony or Tencent) is the end of gaming as we know it\n* People complain about all games blending into one and looking/feeling the same yet continue to purchase sequels and remakes in massive numbers and are then surprised that companies choose the safe path \n* Complain when release dates are missed, but also complain when release dates aren't given. Similarly, complain when early gameplay footage is shown (\"that looks so janky, won't be buying this\"), yet also complain when new announcements are in engine trailers without gameplay\n\nAnd when I say these I don't mean individuals, I'm more referring to the overall Reddit narrative and consensus that you see popping up across the site, which leads to others reading it and spewing the same stuff without actually thinking for a second",

If I ever felt like I wasn't getting a good deal, I'm more than able to unsubscribe, as is anyone else. If D4 gets meaningful content updates like XIV at the pace of XIV without requiring a subscription model, then maybe I will sing praises for the cash shop subsidizing that.

Once you understand that, it demystifies all these business practices. Business are supposed to maximize profits which is fine.\n\nAlso, execs got fuck all to do with this. In a competitive market like gaming this is 100% on the consumers. There are a million good alternative video games to play right now many of which are traditionally monetized, yet you buy the one with a business model you criticize. What market signals do you think you're sending? Developers can only get away with what consumers are willing to stomach, especially in a hyper competitive market. Complaining on Reddit isn't effective activism. Don't buy the game if you don't like it. That's the only thing that works because at the end of the day the purpose of business is to make money and not to make you happy.\n\nLiterally every single normative statement in your post is wrong.

The fairly large community that I play with are all playing D4 and not one of them have expressed any interest in spending additional money on the game except *maybe* a battle pass when it gets shown if it looks decent, and even that is questionable.\n\nAnd these are people that will often buy $30-$60 Path of Exile skin packs, or make it rain with Fortnite cosmetics. They aren't shy about spending money on games. Diablo 4 feels like a full price game that is complete, with some minor extra stuff to buy if you want to, but it doesn't at all pressure you into it like other games do. There are no popups on login telling you to buy shit, no daily login bonus, no weekly login bonus, all the usual shit you get with a MTX driven game.\n\nIt certainly helps that playing the game from start to finish, it *feels* like a complete $60 game. I didn't feel like I was playing a product that was gimped because I didn't want to spend extra money, which happens often with big $60 AAA releases these days.",

Neither has any micro transactions or announced DLC. Jedi Survivor launched what 2 months back same thing",

            "comment": "These comments are insane. Anyone who thinks Blizzard hasn't recouped their costs yet is living in a fantasy. We've got people in here estimating that Diablo 4's budget might rival the budgets of RDR2 and Cyberpunk? Really? There's no way in hell that Diablo 4 cost more than 250 million to make. It's a smaller scale project than either of those games. The development time was shorter by multiple years. Diablo 4 took 6 years to make. RDR2 took 8 and cyberpunk took 9, and they both had bigger teams. Also Blizzard is cheap as fuck these days, they underpay their people and cut corners everywhere. There is no way that Diablo 4 came anywhere close to costing a half a billion dollars to make.",

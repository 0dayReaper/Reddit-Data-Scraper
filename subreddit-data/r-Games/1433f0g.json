Would love to see a whole game designed like that someday, perhaps.\n\nThe cerebella assist looks odd but apparently she's just a placeholder that fits the same hitboxes as a Skeleton they haven't drawn for that move yet.",

Watching Marie\u2019s animation flourishes even in this unfinished state is such a treat, and I genuinely can\u2019t wait for her to release.\n\nThe devs originally teased that if Season Pass One sold well enough they might even add a fifth character to it - I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019ll actually come to pass.",

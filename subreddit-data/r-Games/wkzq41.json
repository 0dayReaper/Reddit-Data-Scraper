That doesn't necessarily mean they're dirty, but all the same,  you can never take them at their word.\n\nWhen it comes to being openly \"PC\", again, that isn't always an indicator of a company covering up how non-PC they are internally. Because putting out a progressive, culturally conscious product is a legitimate selling point nowadays, for better or worse. People want to support companies that put out a socially progressive message, they want to support products that are inclusive and forward thinking, there's a profit motive for it, which (for a lot of complicated reasons) is both a good and a bad thing. Good because visibility of support for something normalizes support for that thing, bad because the inauthenticity is often clumsy and ends up hurting the message, while enriching the wrong people. You *can* run your company consciously and at the same time sell that as part of your product. But realistically, there's no reason to assume that's what's happening.\n\nThe main take away is that no company is anywhere near as progressive, PC, or \"woke\" as the products they sell. For every pride parade, black history exhibit, drag show, or pro-choice movement they sponsor, there's a straight white man sitting in leadership position of that company making money off it. But some companies do a better job than others of trying to match their internal values to the products they sell, and we want to encourage that.",

If you want a great social deduction game that adds something to existing formulas, check out Werewords or Deception: Murder in Hong Kong.",

Similar games, but different enough that they wind up playing very differently (Secret Hitler is much more on the social side of social deduction because limited people get a ton of information where Resistance can be gamed more mathematically because everybody gets the same information).\n\nThat said I think CAH is actually much worse than apples to apples if you're actually competitive. The cards are much less balanced which results in a lot of good jokes being drowned out by whoever has the edgiest white card.",

Like, yeah the characters are awful, but the show acknowledges that they're awful, and they often suffer because of their awfulness.\n\nThe same can't really be said about a card game. \n\nI don't think the card game can be used as definitive proof to say that the creators are racists themselves, though... But when you have news articles like this coming out, it's certainly not a good look.\n\nI've also always felt like there was a fine line between \"It's funny because it's offensive\" and \"It's funny because it's true\". Sometimes people aren't laughing for the right reasons.",

    "postText": "**IMPORTANT**: The original thread has been deleted several times on the No Man's Sky sub. Thanks to the mods of /r/Games for keeping this one alive.\n\n\n**OP:**\n\nSo it's been a week, and it seems like people are realizing that there's a bunch of stuff we were told would be in the game, but isn't. There have been posts and comments here and there talking about it, and giving examples. A few days ago, I decided to dive into the information repository myself, collect as much as I could manage, and put it all in one place. This is mostly a response to the prevailing notion that we hyped ourselves into believing something that wasn't true from the get go. Some definitely have, and we all know the reputation this game's community has gotten. But really, many of us were just going on what we'd been told, and we'd been told a *lot* of things that didn't end up being true.\n\n\nI broke everything down into categories. Beside each missing feature there's links to the YouTube video it's talked about/shown in, and all links are to the relevant time in the video. **Bolded links lead to information from just four months ago.** Besides that, I've pulled a relevant quote that sums up the subject, and when none was available (usually because it's from a trailer,) I've added a short comment. Beneath the categories is extra info, and a comment trying to put things into the context of the game we have. There is more than all of this, I know, but this is what I could find.\n **All information linked is either from the horse's mouth, or official marketing material.** \n\n**EDIT:::** Simplified version here, if you don't care about the lesser details or my rambling context-giving down below. From my comment reply to /u/Mr_Dr0ne :\n\n I got ya, luckily I still have the formatted post. I threw out everything I could find, that was my intention, but my lack of brevity will always be one of my shortcomings. The big momma issues simplified are:\n\n- The loss of planetary physics, which were said to govern many different systems, seemingly in a cascading effect from the top down:\n | [1](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=1m34s) [2](https://youtu.be/ueBCC1PCf84?t=7m58s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=3m14s) [4](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=1m40s)\n\n- The retooling of ships to make them all functionally identical, rather than having different classes for different playstyles, essentially homogenizing ship play into a single playstyle: [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=24m2s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=14m38s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=17m45s)\n\n- The reworking of factions from something with broader significance, into the very simplistic system we have now:  [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=9m37s) [2](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=34s)\n\n- Resource distribution following none of the rules that were spoken of, instead resource variety is more shallow than we'd been lead to believe, so distribution was seemingly homogenized regardless of planet-based factors (likely an effect of the loss of planetary physics)[**1**](https://youtu.be/it_9pUYO2AY?t=4m33s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m2s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=2m48s) [**4**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=10m32s)\n|| This also had a knock-on effect for trading, which was trivialized by the ease in which most resources could be found: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=56s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=15m57s) [3](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=35m20s), and also crafting, which went from something Sean hoped would be community drive a la Minecraft (likely because there were far more resources originally, a la Minecraft, there's more evidence of this than just the crafting,) to something that could only be done through recipes the game must teach you before you can actually use: [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m8s)\n\nThose are the big ones that effect large swaths of the game, and Sean was talking about them all only four months ago.  This is where all the real complexity Sean had spent years talking about was, and all of it was cut from the game, seemingly during the last delay.\n\n**Edit 2::** I'm being told that the butterflies *do* in fact exist, though are rare. Also, that animals *do* attack one another. I'm going to edit in clarifications for both. Guys, I'm having a balls-hard time keeping track of things, and my computer is absolutely crawling. \n\n###Please, if you have a screenshot of something, or know I'm dead wrong about something, send me a private message with it! I can't keep up, and that would make it much easier for me to amend information in. I can't keep up with the comments, but I'd like to credit people with the corrections!\n\n###Edit 3:: Instances of \"desert planet\" changed to \"sand planet\" to reflect the exact thing I'm referencing. I know there are rocky planets with cacti and the like, but so far nothing like the large sandy dune planets like the one show with the giant snake-worm thing. Again, if someone has a pic, please PM it to me! \n\n##Edit 4: I'm editing in the basic change to the ship scanner bit I was wrong about. Still hoping someone could send me a screenshot so I can add that too! PM me if you've got one!\n\n\n^^This ^^might ^^be ^^a ^^good ^^time ^^for ^^some ^^popcorn. ^^This ^^is ^^gonna ^^be ^^a ^^long ^^one.\n\n\n#Misc. Space Gameplay and Elements\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n----------------|---------|----------------------\nLanding on Asteroids| [1](https://youtu.be/n0uYnwqlslU?t=5m8s)| *\"Yeah, at the moment you can land on asteroids.\"*\n|Destroying Space Stations And Fleets| [1](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=27m7s) [2](https://youtu.be/U9muD249qNM?t=10m46s) | *\"Maybe you take out a space station, or a fleet, or you know, something like that...\"*\nGiant Fleets of Ships | [1](https://youtu.be/MZO40WBNA60?t=1m44s) [2](https://youtu.be/ytPJWfrsU0g?t=11s) [3](https://youtu.be/0APP5WcX8v8?t=1m2s)| These are examples much larger fleets than found in the game.\nLarge Freighters Actually Moving | [1](https://youtu.be/RRpDn5qPp3s?t=1m11s) | An example of a freighter flying around, as opposed to just sitting there as a static object.\nScanning Planets From Orbit **Edit:: This is indeed in the game. Leaving it here for posterity.** | [1](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=3m10s) | *\"I can do a scan.\"*\n\n**Comments:** \n\nThere ended up being no landing on asteroids. There's no way to destroy freighters or space stations, and \"fleets\" in the game are compried of maybe three or so ships. Freighters also do not move at all, despite their engines always being on. All of these things make the game much more static and lifeless than we were shown. **Edit:: This is indeed in the game. Leaving it here for posterity.** Scanning from orbit isn't possible, and it's been something a lot of people have been talking about. The scan in the clip covers a much larger area than anything we have in the game, as ship scans currently only find one location on one planet for some reason.\n\n***\n\n#NPCs and NPC Interactions\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nFaction Affiliations w/ Significance | [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=9m37s)| *\"Different races have different attributes [...] and depending on how I'm playing, I might want to kinda make an allegiance with one or [an]other\"*\nTrade Ships Docking w/ Freighters| [**1**](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m57s) | I'm yet to see this actually happen in-game. \nLarge-Scale, Joinable Space Battles Between Factions.  | [1](https://youtu.be/v5sBbjckyzU?t=34s) | *\"Like here, we're at the battle between two warring factions.

But if you\u2019re playing the game and all you want to do is kill things, there are more military-based races, so you might want to try and become friends with them.\u201d [Source](\nhttp://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/03/03/no-mans-sky-a-universe-filled-with-lore-and-language/)\n\n**Extra NPC Interaction Bit -** \n&gt;\u201cHaving said that, being No Man\u2019s Sky, there is a procedural element to your interactions. The AI you talk to will know the name of the planet you\u2019re on and will reference it. They\u2019ll reference wanting certain things based on the environment they\u2019re in. They\u2019ll know if it\u2019s cold, or hot, or whatever. You\u2019ll see a reasonable amount of variety \u2014 it\u2019s not just pre-baked dialogue.\u201d [Source](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/03/03/no-mans-sky-a-universe-filled-with-lore-and-language/)\n\n\n\n**Comments:** \n\n**Faction affiliations have been completely trivialized from what we were shown, and seem to have been pared down to almost no significance within the last few months.** Sean talked a lot about how you could have a significant standing with factions that would meaningfully effect the game world. This is not the case, the serve nearly no purpose at all from what I can tell. They open up a few options for things like shield and health recharges, neither of which you would *ever* actually need them to do for multiple reasons. You can also farm words from their languages at a certain point, but it hardly seems like HG meant for this. You can max out faction rep in your first play session, and there are only three ranks for each. Losing rank seems very hard to do, even if you're trying to do it.\n\nMaybe the worst of all is that there are no faction battles to join. Factions don't seem to have any interactions with each other at all, let alone have giant space battles. This is a huge bummer, it looked like so much fun. Factions you're friendly with won't even help you if you're being shot by pirates right next to them! It seems like the whole faction element was almost completely removed from the game, and it was something Sean was talking about just four months ago.\n\n***\n\n#Planets, Stars, and the Cosmos\n\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nRinged Planets | [1](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0) | *\"Yeah, we haven't shown that yet, but yeah. if it's in sci-fi and sci-fi book covers, we kinda need to do it.\"*\nSand Planets **Edited from \"Desert planets\" to clarify**| [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=2m6s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/CTRi2aEJrgQ?t=53s) [3](https://youtu.be/RRpDn5qPp3s?t=1m32s) [4](https://youtu.be/nmwG6Sj1Yfg?t=3m18s) [5](https://youtu.be/WQhSP82uhY4?t=1m2s) [6](https://youtu.be/0APP5WcX8v8?t=53s) Sand planets were shown right up until a few months ago.

If there is a day to night cycle, it happens because they are slowly transitioning between a series of different boxes.\"\n\n&gt;\"With us,\u201d Murray continued, \u201cwhen you're on a planet, you can see as far as the curvature of that planet. If you walked for years, you could walk all the way around it, arriving back exactly where you started. Our day to night cycle is happening because the planet is rotating on its axis as it spins around the sun. There is real physics to that. We have people that will fly down from a space station onto a planet and when they fly back up, the station isn't there anymore; the planet has rotated. People have filed that as a bug.\u201d* [Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/artifi cial-universe-no-mans-sky/463308/)\n\n**Comments:**  **EDIT:: Desert planets edited to Sand planets to clarify**\n\nNo ringed planets, and no sand planets. Ringed planets were only talked about, but sand planets were on display multiple times. Considering planets look very samey in the game, who knows how much variety has been cut. There seems to only be typical out-of-bounds void outside of solar systems, so there's no way to travel out of them to other systems manually. If you go far enough out, things start bugging out, and your game will crash eventually.\n\n**Planets do not rotate on their axis, moons do not orbit their planets, and planets do not orbit a sun. There isn't even a sun, it's just decoration on the sky box.** This may be the largest cut element, \"solar systems\" in the game are only static planets hanging in space. Whether or not you land on the dark or light side of a planet doesn't matter. This may have more wide-ranging effects than just aesthetics, as there were many things said to be governed by the planetary simulation. Planets closest to the \"sun\" are just as likely to be frozen as the ones furthest away, for instance, which may have messed with all the systems that relied on there being a meaningful distinction there, considering all of those things either seem completely borked, or removed outright (more on that further down.) In terms of player experience, the loss of the simulation meant the loss of dynamic solar systems, which meant everything became little more than a shiny diorama. This is another thing that Sean was talking about just four months ago. \n\n***\n\n#Ships and Flight\n\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nActual Ship Classes And Differentiation| [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=24m2s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=14m38s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=17m45s) | Hard to pull a quote here that represents the full bredth of this one.\nNaming Ships | [1](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=38m18s) | *\"Ships are actually a discovery just like everything else, and you can name your discoveries\"*\nMore Natural Flight Characteristics | [1](https://youtu.be/MZO40WBNA60?t=2m20s) | Ship flying more like a ship than in the actual game\n**Comments:** \n\nYou cannot scan or name ships, and despite there being footage of somewhat-complex flight, flight in the game is relegated to almost-autopilot in atmospheres, and sluggish flying-through-pudding in space.\n\n**But the big one here is that ships are all functionally identical except for inventory slots, all other differences are cosmetic alone.** Your trader ship is as good at dogfighting as your fighter, your science ship makes for a fine trader, so on and so forth. Things like speed and handling can not be upgraded, and are the same for the first ship you fly and the 48-slot beast you late-game in. What upgrades do exist are linear progressions for your **two** guns, your shields, and your warp drive. Sean said this is a space game, and there's nearly zero complexity or depth in the most important tool for spacefaring. Just four months ago, this did not seem to be the case.\n\n***\n\n#Trade, Resources and Crafting\n\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nResources Depending On Distance From Sun, Environmental Factors | [**1**](https://youtu.be/it_9pUYO2AY?t=4m33s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=2m2s) [**3**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=2m48s) [**4**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=10m32s) | *\"You'll learn planets that are further from the sun have certain types of resources, planets that are closer have certain types of resources, or planets that have certain environments.\"* \nThe Ability To Play The Game Solely As A Trade or Solely in Space | [1](https://youtu.be/BXUrOFVItgs?t=56s) [**2**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=15m57s) [3](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=35m20s) |*\"But you can also [...] just not gather resources.

If those things exist in some small way, they're so subtle as to not even be worth mentioning. All planets have mostly the same resources, with only rarer resources being *mostly* split up onto different planets. But there are only maybe 4 of that kind of element anyway. Maybe your planet with gold doesn't have emeril or aluminium (sometimes they have all 3 of those,) but it has everything else. You don't need to go to an icy planet as a sure-fire way to find plutonium like Sean says in one of those videos, plutonium is everywhere in abundance! The exotic elements have almost no uses outside of selling, and elements like gold and emeril only have a few more uses than those ones. \n\nI really don't know if it's even *possible* to play the game without landing, but even if you can get everything you need from a store (which doesn't sell much of anything in large enough quantities to be of much use) and from robbing freighters, the idea that you could play this game as a trader is a joke. Trading is a paper-thin mechanic, and there's next to nothing to do with money anyway even if you *are* landing on planets. Trading between systems also seems completely implausible, considering finding your way back and forth to systems you've been to is frustrating to say the least. \n\nCrafting is another thing that Sean has vastly overstated. If you can only craft the things the game has specifically taught you how to craft, how can there be some big community push to figure out how to craft them? Hell, much of the stuff you craft is only used to craft other things the game has to teach you how to craft before you can craft. And why is that? Why is it that you have to use Element 1 and Element 2 to craft A, use A to craft B, use B to craft C, and use C to craft warp fuel? Why does it take such a convoluted process?\n\nThere's evidence in the newer demo videos of more elements in the game. I think there were supposed to be a ton more elements, enough to warrant the complexity in all these systems, but they got cut. When the whole system was simplified, it became a matter of replacing them with what they had left, but had to be balanced for difficulty and that's why recharging your warp drive involves a four-step process. Everything about the complexity Sean talked about would require there to be more than just a handful of elements, and Sean was talking about **all** this stuff in April. This whole aspect seems like a complete mess, and I wonder if it has to do with the simulation being canned. \n\n\n***\n\n#Animals/Creatures\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nAnimals and Plants That Eat Meat -- **THIS SEEMS TO BE IN** | [1](https://youtu.be/n0uYnwqlslU?t=2m18s) [2](https://youtu.be/GjKTJblJpw0?t=21m9s) | *GI - \"Do the animals eat each other?

They have friends and best friends too. It's just a label on a bit of code\u2014but another creature of the same type nearby is potentially their friend. They ask their friends telepathically where they\u2019re going so they can coordinate.\u201d\n\n**Comments:** \n\nThere was a lot of talk about all the things animals were capable of in this game, and it seems like none of it actually made it into the game we were sold. I've never seen  one of those plants attack an animal, and I've never seen animals attack, let alone *eat* eachother. They don't seem to be capable of much beyond squealing, running/walking, and pantomiming eating or something. Aggressive animals just rush you until you kill them, that whole \"shoot the ground and scare it away\" thing doesn't seem to work, in my experience. They just don't seem to do a damn thing, and you'll clip right through them if you try to walk into one. Their animations are also really clunky depending on how large they are. As far as creatures following some kind of ruleset for what kind of creature can be on what kind of planet, there doesn't seem to be any. You'll even get what sounds like the same distant-sounding animal calls on planets completely devoid of life. We probably all know that call, it's that whale-like vocalization, and it seems to be the same one used for every planet.\n\nThey also clip right through trees and foliage as though they don't even care they're walking straight through a tree, so they certainly don't cause the leaves and branches to shake like in that one vid. You don't just happen upon some large land creature having a drink whole in the water, maybe because rivers were scrapped...\n\n***\n\n#Planetary Surface Features\n\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nRivers | [1](https://youtu.be/h-kifCYToAU?t=8m6s) [2](https://youtu.be/U9muD249qNM?t=8m28s) [2](https://youtu.be/-sb-clg3Tlw?t=1m31s) [4](https://youtu.be/-sb-clg3Tlw?t=3m47s) | Link 4 contains gameplay with a river.\nLarge Structures | [1](https://youtu.be/RRpDn5qPp3s?t=32s) [2](https://youtu.be/MZO40WBNA60?t=2m30s) [3](https://youtu.be/0APP5WcX8v8?t=32s) [4](https://youtu.be/0APP5WcX8v8?t=43s) | Larger structures than are currently in the game.\nCrashed Freighters| [1](https://youtu.be/RRpDn5qPp3s?t=1m19s) | A freighter crashed on the surface of a planet, surrounded by sentinels.\nStructures With Moving Parts | [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=8m16s) [2](https://youtu.be/WQhSP82uhY4?t=1m43s) | Some portals seem to have had the same spinning metal ring as the Space Anomoly ship.\nPortals | [1](https://youtu.be/WQhSP82uhY4?t=1m37s) | The structures have been found, but not activated.\n**Comments:**\n\nRivers can be seen in at least one video, and they were talked about a lot. There are barely even any lakes in the game, and the ones I've found were pretty small. Overall, most planets have zero water on them, even though they have obvious precipitation. \n\nThere are also no large structures like we were shown, nor any buildings with moving parts. The planets are populated with small, identical buildings with no dynamic features. There are also no crashed freighters to explore. \n\nThe big one here is that the portals we have found are dead, and we don't know if they can be activated. **But ask yourself, if every planet has most of the elements you need, and finding the ones any planet doesn't have is as easy as searching the surrounding planets, what function would the portals even serve? This is another huge hint that there was once a larger table of elements to feed the more complex features the game once had. If maxing your ship, suit and multitool can be done on your starter planet, and planets closer to the center don't have resources any more rare than outer planets, why would you ever need a portal like the ones they talked about?** They would serve no purpose, that's why I believe they're just static objects now. Maybe HG thought no one would find them if they weren't marked by scans, and that's why they didn't bother removing them.\n\n***\n\n#Sentinels\n\n\nFeature/Element | Source(s) | *Relevant Quote*/Comment\n---|---|----\nSentinels in Large Packs | [1](https://youtu.be/-sb-clg3Tlw?t=4m27s) | Gameplay showing sentinels in larger numbers than found in the game.\nMaintaining Wanted Level Indoors | [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=11m49s) | Footage of a wanted level not being cleared by entering a structure.\nAmbient Walker Sentinels  | [1](https://youtu.be/WQhSP82uhY4?t=40s) | Walker sentinel just out in the environment, and awakening in front of the player.\n**Comments:**\n\nSentinels only ever seem to come 3-4 at a time at most, certainly not in large packs like seen in that clip. Walkers aren't just chilling out in the environment either, they spawn when you get a full wanted bar. But none of them pose any real risk anyway. Dog sentinels and walkers only come one at a time, and you really have to go out of your way to even get a walker to spawn most of the time because it's so easy to take out sentinels before they call for backup. You want to know how easy it is to kill sentinels? Hit a sentinel with your mining beam just once, then aim off into space 10-20 feet to the side of it. Watch as your beam flies off into space, but blows up the sentinels anyway. Seriously, try it, their hit box becomes the size of a starship. \n\nEven so, you can just melee jump a few times and escape a wanted level pretty easily, or pop into any structure, which deactivates them. This wasn't the case four months ago.\n\n***\n\n#Miscellaneous\n\n\n\nFoo | Bar | text\n---|---|----\nBeing Able To See and Play With Other Players | [1](https://youtu.be/n0uYnwqlslU?t=58s)  | There are more examples of Sean talking about it, including one soon after the linked bit, but people have focused on this one, so we've all seen it by now. \nBeacons Marking Points of Interest With Waypoints  | [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5sBbjckyzU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=5m13s) | A beacon marking points of interest across a wide area.\nUseful Marking with Binoculars | [**1**](https://youtu.be/cUnKJyoyIIk?t=1m8s) | Binoculars actually useful for marking buildings and such.\nHacking Reinforced Doors | [**1**](https://youtu.be/D-uMFHoF8VA?t=10m57s) | *\"Well normally what you would do is you would hack it, that would be the best way.\"*\nRadio Chatter | [1](https://youtu.be/nmwG6Sj1Yfg?t=1m9s) [2](https://youtu.be/nmwG6Sj1Yfg?t=3m7s)| Radio chatter from inside your starship. \nTranslucent Glass On Starships | [1](https://youtu.be/nmwG6Sj1Yfg?t=1m29s) | Glass windshield on starship rather than just black paint.\n**Comments:**\n\nObviously, we all know about the multiplayer stuff. There's no confirmation that player-instances even exist.\n\nBeacons in that video mark points of interest on a large swath of the planet. In the game, they zoom out, but don't mark anything. You also don't need them to upload discoveries. i think this is another tip that a lot of things were removed. Why would you need to mark all this stuff in such a large area when it's the exact same stuff that's in *every* area? Marking things with those binoculars in that other video looks to be a *ton* more useful than what we ended up with, which is a green glow that often matches the background, and a tiny white dot that sometimes mark things on the other side of the planet because it's buggy as hell.\n\nBeing able to hack reinforced doors is talked about, but in the game, the only way to get in is to blow them up.\n\nRadio chatter and glass windscreens aren't much, but they'd add some much-needed liveliness to the game.\n\n***\n\n###For all Sean said about how complex these systems were, how did they actually end up? They all fell well short of what was advertised.\n\n\nPillar | Why Does It Fall Short of What Was Advertised?\n---|---\nExplore | Planets are less diverse than we'd been told, and with less features. They also don't seem to become appreciably more interesting as you move towards the center, if at all. The pool of resources is shallow, and they're spread more or less homogeneously among planets. There are no objects on planets that you will not have seen in an hour or two on your first planet, and no objects in space that can be found through exploration. Explore should be renamed Sightsee, as that's more or less what you're doing when exploring because you quickly run out of significant things to discover.\nFight | Ship combat was trivialized by the removal of classes and ship attributes. Large scale space battles were cut as well, and you cannot destroy space stations or freighters as we'd been told. You will fight sentinels and pirates alone, all of which fly ships which are functionally identical to your own. Ground combat occurs with only a few sentinels at a time, and poses no challenge. Fights are easily won, escaped from, or avoided entirely.\nTrade | Trading offers few benefits outside of selling valuable items to upgrade to better equipment. There are few items you'd actually ever want to buy from a trader, and few things to sell that are worth using an inventory slot on instead of a gold/emeril stack. Grinding for elements/rare items to sell is as far as most will ever go, and money quickly becomes useless in the game. You probably can't play as a space trader exclusively, and trading between systems doesn't seem worth the hassle even if you can. Trading with factions is a non-consideration as you will max out in rep for everyone very quickly. There simply isn't enough elements in the game to support deep trade, as there's little to actually need, and little worth actually selling.\nSurvive | Everything you need for basic survival is bountiful on every planet. Sentinels pose no risk. The only thing that poses any particular risk is extreme planets, and there's zero incentive to even really visit those as they've got nothing you couldn't easily find elsewhere, not that the risk they pose isn't easily mitigated and/or dealt with.\n\n\n\n\n**Considering how much is missing from the game, we have every reason to question whether or not any of the complex systems we were told would be in the game are actually there.** Do the planets get any more exotic as you move to the center *at all*? Are those \"significant\" player-made disruptions to the game world *actually* being saved globally? Is there *anything* besides names being saved globally at all if there are no fleets to destroy, and you can't destroy space stations? Do any of the things they talked about that govern things on a large scale exist? If they said nothing about the game-changing loss of planetary physics, are there less noticeable things that we haven't been told are gone?\n\nAs you can see, the game we were told we'd get is a far more feature-rich, complex and dynamic game than the one we actually got. What we got was a static, lifeless and paper thin experience by comparison. I encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time watching the old trailers and demos to more fully grasp just how different the game is from the one they'd been selling us on for all those years.\n***\n#There's more and it ain't pretty, in my opinion.\nClearly Sean was showing off a very different game four months ago. That footage is incredibly misleading, as it talks about many aspects of the game that no longer exist. Watching the IGN First from April bummed me the hell out, because that game looked amazing, and the game we got seems less like 1.03 and more like 0.5.03. It didn't make me mad, I didn't feel like I'd be straight-up lied to, only maybe unintentionally misled. **Then just as I was wrapping this post up, I found the real kicker that pissed me all the way off.** Maybe others have realized this, but I didn't until last night:\n###The most recent promo material from July, the four pillars videos released just a month before launch, *are all using new footage from that same old build of the game that very clearly does not represent the one people can buy*. That footage is still being used to sell this game even now, and it's no better than what Sega did with Aliens: Colonial Marines. \n\nI feel utterly bamboozled now, possibly even hoodwinked. It's one thing for footage from four months ago to be unrepresentative -- development is a process, and things change. But a month old, when obviously the game had been significantly altered by then? To continue to use misleading footage in the commercials knowing the game had changed drastically? That's being intentionally misleading. It makes you wonder: if they're using footage they know to be misleading now, did they know it was misleading four months ago when they were making a big press push using that same build? As corny and melodramatic as it was last week,  I think it's fair to wonder if we've been legitimately lied to at this point. \n\nIf nothing more, we deserve some answers. No more vague nonsense, but real answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It seems that when you are flying around, it uses a lower detail version of the world, and doesn't even generate most of the details of the terrain. When you press the 'land' button, it seems to kick the game into the higher detail mode. The game probably cant generate/render the high-detail terrain as you fly quickly over it, and the terrain would look really gross in the low-detail mode if you were able to fly a few feet away from it... So we get this really annoying mechanic to hide a technical restraint of the game engine.",

You can crash if you tilt 90 degrees to the side and deliberately turn into the ground, but your ship will just keep trying to move forward.\n\nI've gotten my ship stuck inside a cave because the auto-lander parked me right in front of a large cave entrance, and on take-off it shot straight into the cave wall trying to burrow deeper because, again, no stop or reverse.\n\nThe only reason to use the ship on a planet is to move large distances faster than on foot.

Each new planet is still essentially the same as the last, and building a base on a planet and \"settling down\" is the antithesis of an exploration-based game. There's no content that makes me want to stick around on a planet, and adding base-building won't change that. It's \"might as well keep moving - I'll easily find another planet like this one further down the road anyway.\"\n\nBesides, once you leave the system to explore, there's no way you're ever getting back when you're dozens of jumps away. There's no fast-travel system to allow you to easily return to planets you've already explored, or even any way to mark a specific area of a planet to return were you to somehow manage to be able to.",

For example, you could have a large space-exploration ship that you upgrade which you might fly into orbit around a planet, and then have a small lander which you use to go through the atmosphere to actually land and explore the surface.",

Whether they eventually can deliver it all remains to be seen, but you have to admit they're not fucking about. :)\n\nThey also publish an [insanely detailed report each month](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/15408-Monthly-Studio-Report) about what each studio is up to, and the German one reads like this:\n\n&gt;Tree-ification of the ZoneSystem: The ZoneSystem was started as a spatial data structure which replaced the octree we used for fast culling for rendering. Such cull operations are mostly \u201clarge\u201d, meaning they tend to cover a large area. Now the ZoneSystem (as planed from the beginning) is being used for more and more systems. Most of those systems tend to do \u201csmall\u201d queries, like finding all objects in a 2m x 2m x 2m box with Tags [x,y,z]. The ZoneSystem is now responsible to find all objects in the whole universe inside this box extremely fast. When we experimented with this, it turned out that some parts of the ZoneSystem still utilized a linear search, and those didn\u2019t scale well in our large universe with such small queries (large ones had enough other cost to not notice those issues). Hence we extended all internal data structures to utilize AABB trees, allowing us to more quickly exclude objects improving the runtime from O(N) to roughly O(Log2(N))). As this was a very complex change, since such tree structures must also be maintained in an efficient manner when some objects move, it took some time. But we are now in the final steps of local testing and so far it looks very promising and to give us the performance benefits we were aiming for.\n\nI have no idea what any of that means, but it definitely gives me confidence that they have some very competent people working on it.

And nothing promised for Star Citizen is really un-doable, it'll just require a lot of work and money, which they have.\n\nAnd considering all the progress they've made so far, I don't think it's reasonable to just say the money is being wasted or it's a scam or vaporware. Regardless of whether they can actually do it, I think we can all agree by now that they *are* actually trying to do it and putting the money towards the game.

There's a lot of reasons for why this happens; the worst thing that could happen for your game is to have it crash or bug out when live on stage, it's also a nightmare to set up a dev kit to run your game depending on your dev environment (and E3 rarely has devkits for stage presentations anyway), and in most cases, developers just don't want unfinished builds of their game floating around outside of the studio just to do a stage presentation. It's WAY too big a risk.\n\nIt's much easier to just send over a .avi file than run all those risks lol",

They had a ton of cool ideas and I know I was really excited by the concepts they were discussing, but it was just too much for them to do in the time they had with the budget they had and they had to gut the game to get it out the door. This isn't just preorders to blame, this is a classic \"indie company overreaching,\" which we've seen a hundred times before. \n\nAs great as indie games are for building a unique and cool game experience centered around a certain type of mechanic, they, by definition, can not do the grand scale all-in stuff we expect from a AAA release. Any time an indie dev markets something, the first thing I ask myself is \"Would a AAA studio consider this ambitious?\" If the answer is yes, the game is going to be crap.\n\nNo Man's Sky would have been ambitious for a studio like BioWare, Ubisoft, Bethesda, or Blizzard, even if it had been in line with those studios' normal shticks. There's no way an indie company was going to manage.",

I'm extremely disappointed in the resource, crafting, and trade systems which are so simplistic it's embarrassing. Another gripe I have are the puzzles you find at transmission towers, in my experience they have been 4 or 5 unbelievably easy \"which number comes next\" questions that are recycled an endless number of times. Who thought that was a good idea? Honestly it's just lazy, they couldn't think of anything better than shitty standardized test questions (on repeat)?",

There are few, if any, alternatives, so everyone who was looking for anything close to NMS saw what they wanted to see in it.  Hello Games did everything they could do to encourage blind faith and misconceptions.\n\nUnfortunately I felt things would go this way when the first trailer came out at VGX.

So the first 16 slots in that are your backpack, then your equipment is right next to it, then your bank, then misc other kinds of storage etc. Not only is this pretty scary design, but supposedly a lot of the old code doesn't work with this in a 'safe' manner with constants but by manually performing arithmetic on inventory indices and magic numbers everywhere (eg if a quest puts a helmet on you for some reason, it just dunks it directly into slot 22 or whatever). So in order to expand the backpack someone would have to go through every line of the old code that ever touched any item storage and guarantee the code still points to the right place, and isn't exceeding it's the bounds or missing any items. Rather than try and fix it and almost certainly introduce a host of pretty serious bugs (item duplication, loss of items, accidently loading inventory items as your equipment, etc) they've opted to let sleeping dogs lie.",

I don't know if that's changed because of changes within gaming journalism, the economics of pre-orders and Kickstarters that essentially front money to developers and publishers for games they're passionate about, or changes within gamers themselves as a result of the internet's ability to create community echo chambers, or something else entirely, but it definitely feels like patience is not the virtue it once was.",

I keep up with the latest gaming news, follow new devs and IPs, and (try to) stay abreast of the conversation in general. But I don't really *act on* any of that info or hype. Any info I take in that's about current games is used almost solely to be able to participate in the conversation with both real and virtual people. \n\nIn reality, my life doesn't allow for much gaming time anymore. Kids, careers, etc get in the way. I buy a few games a year, play like 6 hours a week. I can't even remember the last game I bought for full price. The last game I bought within the first week of its release was Overwatch (trades and gift cards), and I *knew perfectly well* I was going to love it beforehand. Will I ever play competitively? Fuck no. But I've enjoyed my time with it. Just like I'm currently enjoying Need for Speed: Rivals at the moment, a game that came out in 2013 that I just picked up three days ago. \n\nPoint is, each \"half\" of the gaming community has its place for different people. I've inhabited both parts out of habit and nostalgia (grew up following gaming journalism and being reeeeaaallly into then-current games), as well as my current reality (not having the time/money/inclination to \"be a gamer\"). \n\nI'm also thrilled I missed buying into the NMS hype. But I've enjoyed the fuck out of reading about it all.",

This takes less than 24 hours after release. \n\nOnly buy early access if it is worth the price at the time you buy it.  Same for released AAA titles too, ignore promises of future patches/features and buy based on what you get when you buy.\n \nThis applies even for trusted developers that haven't screwed you over in the past.  They aren't going to run out of copies to sell, so why pre-order?",

Even back when most games were physically sold, only a very few titles would ever be so popular as to actually have a possibility if selling out, and if they did, big whoop. Chances are the store across town would have it. \n\nBut especially now, in the age of digital downloads there is literally no good reason for the customer to pre-order. You know there's no good reason because they have to keep sweetening the pot with exclusive DLC weapons or skins and more recently slight discounts. If it was in our interests, the proposition would stand on its own. \n\n**STOP. PRE-ORDERING. GAMES.**",

It's still good, just not what I was hoping for.\n\nHello Games made a good burger, but still owes me some pickles. Here's hoping they deliver soon.\n\nI really do think Sean and his team are a good bunch of well meaning people who honestly thought they might be able to deliver what they set out to, and tried to get as close to it as possible, but failed to hit the bullseye. \n\nBy then, the hype train had 'gone plaid', and they were helplessly caught in the wake.\n\nStill, we were shown, told, and sold product '!*X*!', but really got product 'x-minor!'. I am still enjoying it for what it is, but it is indeed not what they have been advertising all the way up until launch. I'd still really like to try out that game build.

Now, add that to the other claim that \"every atom of the universe is procedurally generated\", and I understand that some people can have very wild expectations about the game. It gives the impression that the game recreates physics law to generate its planets and flaura/fona, which is flat out wrong. The game is far from being that complex. Animales are just a mish mash of different puzzle pieces, which the most naive way to create alien animals, and there is also nothing interesting in the elements used to compose the universe. It's just rocks here and there to collect. This has nothing to do with what Sean Murray hinted at. The clever bastard was very careful not to give specifics but was just vague enough to hint at something way way more complex and interesting.\n\nSean Murray did everything he could to generate false expectations from the players, and never contradicted any wild speculation that people had. I remember him being invited by Steven Colbert on his show, and while Colbert was speculating about what the game was and what you could do, Sean remained silent, or smiled/nodded.\n\nWhat surprises me is that everyone seems to be really leniant with Sean Murray, while he flat out lied about his game's features, and was dishonnest on multiple occasions. Just because he has a 'friendly' face doesn't mean he's not a crook.",

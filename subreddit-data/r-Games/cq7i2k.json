But they plan to let you add your library, achievements, check friends list and status, have cross platform chat functionality. I also read somewhere that it's possible to make your own additions to the launcher, kind of like a browser extension/add-on if you will (if this was just an idea or planned feature I don't know). If that becomes a possibility, it's entirely possible to setup Galaxy 2.0 to work with emulators, though that obviously won't correctly track in-game time, achievements and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way just getting to have a somewhat complete library, including chat, friends list and achievements (even if only for show) sounds pretty neat. And who knows, maybe one day we'll get to see an even bigger push to cross-platform play with PC.",

As others have mentioned it would allow anyone to review any game enabling some kind of review bombing for any reason.\n\nThe, in my opinion, much bigger problem comes from version differences. Several old games have been fixed by GoG while the steam version is apparently broken. Someone playing them on GoG would review them positive which wouldn't be representative for the steam version. Similar problems opposite like the case with tiny build recently where GoG versions were not updated for a long time. \n\nNot to mention the difference between PC and console versions.\n\nIf any such cross review feature would be added it should probably be opt-in by default.

Especially when several games now kinda look the same in that regard with UE5. \n\nSomething i find more important is animations. I dont need raytracing upscaled realistic graphics if the animations end up clunky and bad. This usually happens with 3D indiegames who dont have the budget but slapping on the newest graphical specialties isnt as much work.",

Yeah, it's 30 FPS, but in any given second you might have the first 6 frames at a steady 33ms frame time that would give you a clean 30 FPS, the next 6 frames come in slowly at 66ms so now we're at about 600ms but only 12 frames rendered, then the next 12 come in at 16ms to catch up, and then the next 6 after that come in at 33ms again. Sure, that was 30 FPS in that one second, but it *felt* like 30 FPS for 1/5th of a second, then 15 FPS for 1/5th of a second, then 60 FPS for 2/5ths of a second, back to 30 FPS for the last 1/5th.\n\nYes, I'm aware that's not really how it works and it would be more like 33-16-24-66-33-33-33-16 etc., but that was just an example.",

The kind of triple buffering used in the vast majority of cases (and definitely in console games) is the standard type where latency is higher than double buffering (because it uses an additional buffer) if the target framerate is reached, but lower when it's not reached since it doesn't drop all the way to 30/20/whatever fps in that case. The form of triple buffering that actually gives you lower latency requires having internal framerates of at least double the display's framerate, which is not realistic in many cases.\n\nIn short, assuming standard triple buffering, if your game drops frames often then triple buffering is preferred for latency (but it will cause judder during drops), but if you can reach the target fps the vast majority of the time then double buffering is best for latency (but it will cause a huge fps drop if you miss the refresh window by even a tiny amount).\n\n[This](https://youtu.be/seyAzw9zEoY?t=770) is a good summary of the effects of various vsync methods.",

There are hitches when you go from the highest level in the game to the lowest, but given the hardware, it\u2019s amazing they even allow you to do that seamlessly. I personally think it is time for Nintendo to make a new console, but to say something like ToTK can\u2019t keep a consistent 30, you\u2019re wrong.",

            "comment": "Kind of confusing to contrast performance with realism. Graphics quality and realism are not synonymous.\n\nGraphics quality is very cool but I think having a smooth play experience that\u2019s not jarring has always been more important to anyone who had the choice. Historically that has only been PC gamers because console games don\u2019t expose quality settings. Me and everyone I talk to has always turned down graphics quality a bit if their game wasn\u2019t running smoothly, so I don\u2019t think choosing performance over quality is anything new.\n\nRealism is something else altogether. Like if you make \u014ckami today with the best graphics quality you can get, it\u2019s still not going to look realistic because its art direction just isn\u2019t meant to be realistic. I\u2019ve always found art styles with some creative liberty and artistry to them to be much more interesting than games that try to look realistic.\n\nI don\u2019t think comparing two games for their performance and graphics and trying to figure out what gamers want from that comparison makes any sense at all. People buy games because of reasons like: it\u2019s a franchise they love, the gameplay appeals to them, their friends are playing it. Someone might _not_ but a game if they hear it plays really badly but outside of extreme cases it\u2019s not really a factor for decision making. It\u2019s the developers who make this tradeoff, not the buyers. The decision might have an impact on sales but it\u2019s impossible to isolate that from all the much stronger marketing reasons why people choose one game over another, at least not without extensive research.",

There's only so much you can do with what's under-the-hood a Tegra X1 tablet.  I think it was MVG who posted the video showing that the memory bandwidth seemed to be the biggest bottleneck.\n\nThe DRS they've implemented to keep the framerate close to 30 can cause pretty jarring resolution drops. Unfortunately even that doesn't keep it at a consistent 30. Due to double-buffering (to keep input responsive, which I absolutely wouldn't give up), when the framerate drops below 30, it goes straight to 20 - so even a minor dip can become a major one.\n\nThat said, it's a *phenomenal* game. It just bumps up *hard* against the Switch's limitations. Seeing what it can look like on better hardware (through emulation) really hammers that home.\n\nHopefully when the next Nintendo system coes out (whenever that may be) they'll do something uncharacteristic and allow for backwards compatibility with performance improvements. BotW and TotK definitely deserve to be seen in a better light performance-wise.",

TotK is amazing to look at, it's just not a technical marvel. Similar to how Wind Waker looks pretty great still 20 years later despite its age.",

But I did the opposite for Jedi Survivor (motion blur on, quality mode on) and it was beautiful. \n\nThe parry times are very forgiving, and since it\u2019s not a FPS motion blur masked the 30fps quite nicely.",

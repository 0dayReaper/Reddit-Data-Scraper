The reason Portable told its story in a visual novel style was because making a FeMC with tangible differences (aka not simply a model + pronoun swap like a lot of RPGs do) was a lot harder than they were expecting and the effort basically added another 1/3 of Portable's entire development on top of it.",

What they said in an interview is that Persona 5 can't work with a female protagonist because plot reasons, and if they do implement the feature the story has to be build with the feature in mind.",

As you pointed out certain plotlines like P5 wouldn't work with a female protagonist (not that they didn't indulge to a degree since Kasumi basically is a female Joker) and you ideally don't want to do more work than you really have to, especially when crafting a big narrative/social sim aspect.",

The P Team even if they decided to never make a female protagonist again (which they haven't) will never say it because is one of the most requested features people ask for. And when they said no FeMC, this only applied to Persona 5. Persona 4 (and 3) could have feMC, the plot doesn't have to be reworked apart from having the point of view shifted to the female party members.\n\nAnd making more work that you already do doesn't apply as they can just build it from the ground up.",

I know differences will come eventually..........but it's eventually.\n\nAdded to this in how you couldn't use your old save and play NG+ straightaway instead is another bummer, because those \"secret\" bosses could be a form of motivation itself.\n\nI love me ALL Persona, I just think they need to reapproach how they go about their enhanced additions a bit.

Both amazing games, but seeing people talk about them on Reddit makes me realize people can tolerate repetitive experiences much more than I can. \n\nRoyal was the better game mechanically but it was tough to burn through 95 hours of mostly the same content to get to the new stuff. Took several breaks. I even took a months-long break after playing base P5 for about 70 hours\n\nRoyal could\u2019ve been a DLC. I\u2019m seeing how the new Cyberpunk is handling this new $30 DLC that\u2019ll revamp the entire experience. Royal could\u2019ve done the same thing, I can\u2019t defend them making it a brand new full-priced game",

Since the game is mainly presented Visual Novel-style, it's mostly some added VA lines and writing, with a couple extra social links. Not exactly a huge expansion to the original game.\n\nI'd have loved to see the option, but never expected it.",

As someone that purchased P5 vanilla and put like 100 hours into it, I don't think I was ever bothered that a version came out literally years later with more content.\n\nMy partner purchased Royal and played through it but I still haven't touched it. When I replay 5 again one day I'll play that version, but I'm not annoyed that I didn't experience that version the first time through.\n\nI appreciate this time it would be content they've already \"made\" being added back in, but it's not like this is a remaster where they just port it in, all that stuff would have to be made from the ground up again. I can see why it wouldn't be a priority for vanilla but something they could do for the DLC version down the line.",

                    "comment": "You and rest not being bothered by release of Persona 5 Royal after you play Persona 5 is completly normal because at the time you played it Royal didn't exist.\n\nWith Persona 3 you already know that story in the epilogue (The Answer) and FeMC route with new different social link already exist and Atlus has for weird reason opted out of using them when they already remaking whole game. The whole thing with Persona 3 was that there was no \"definitive version\" of the game. FES had \"The Answer\" and some QoL improvements and Portable had FeMC route. With Remake Atlus had perfect opportunity to make the definitive version but they fumbled the bag. \n\nJust assume you played Persona 5 Royal already and imagine that in like 15 years Atlus announces that they are remaking \"old Persona game\" and instead of remaking Persona 5 Royal they are remaking base Persona 5 and later they would sell Royal as DLC. Would that be fine?\n\nKeep in mind that with Persona 5 Royal they didn't provide an option to buy Royal version as DLC for those who owned Persona 5 already. You had to buy new game for a full price. And obviously when they released Royal for PS5 they didn't allow, even paid, upgrade from PS4 version. They are really anti-consumer company with their business practice and I don't think we should give them pass or benefit of the doubt on that.\n\nEDIT: Because due to restriction mode I got some notifications about Answer being bad and not worth remaking. Yes, \"Answer\" is terrible from gameplay perspective but its still important in overall plot and referenced in Arena games. Remake would be great opportunity to make it shorter and more integrated into main game as sort of \"post-game\" content.",

Not the action heavy combat, im fine with that but.... the almost desperation to be treated as a \"Serious game for serious people\". The constant refrain of GoT being a huge inspiration just lands flat for me, and the fact that certain people had to FIGHT to get things like Chocobos and a single Moogle into the game.\n\nit just.... doesnt sound enjoyable.and the more is said about it the more it sounds like generic dark fantasy game #6527",

                    "comment": "Maybe FF isn't for you then, and that's fine. But I will also say that, every FF starts off slow and the gameplay simple. When I first played FF 13-2, i almost quit in the first hour due to the gameplay being boring, but I stuck with it then it became one of my favourites. I also struggled with FF7R - I haven't played the original and the story wasn't catching my attention. The boss fights were great but for the first half of the game, they were few and far between. I almost gave up but from about chapter 13 onwards to the end (Ch18?), it was non stop action and boss battles. One of the best long segments of a game i've played.\n\nI've learned that with FF, sometimes you gotta stick with them till they get good, and unfortunately that isn't for everyone. They're not all like this, FF9 is my favourite and I love it from start to finish.\n\nWith this demo, the combat is very simple with just spamming square, throw some magic in, and evade. However once you complete the demo (\\~2 hours), you unlock another mode which throws you a bit later in to the game with some gear and 3 Eikons (basically 3 magic elements without giving too much away). Here, you fight a lot more enemies, an interesting boss, the Eikons give you 2 abilities each (L2 + Square/Triangle), the 'evade' button is a different action for the other 2 elements, and you have 'limit break' which is like a 'berserk' mode where you do more damage, attack faster etc. It gives you a taste of the combat system in full, and it is MUCH better than the start.\n\nIf you're still on the fence, try finishing the demo and give the combat demo a shot, maybe it'll convince you.",

You can perfect parry with your charged flame sword. (If you swap to control scheme 3) you can charge your magic up while continuing to fight in melee. You can intersperse magic in your melee combo. You have multiple gap closers. You have some aerial options, including jumping off an enemy. \n\nEven in the first 2 hours, the combat was really fun. I\u2019d say the main thing that felt lackluster was the aerial combat. But some of the trailers have show a lot there, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we got some abilities to make it feel better.",

FF7R's battle system is great, the issue is that it doesn't force the player to engage with it until you play on Hard (you can pretty much beat the standard difficulty with no roadblocks mostly by mashing and using items), but once you actually use it, it becomes a great time. \n\nEven then those aren't how most of the series plays. FF1-10 and 13 are Turn based menu heavy games and require strategy even on the regular difficulties. They are more focused on strategy and character building/equipment than action.",

The article doesn't really mention it but in the press release they said in addition to refunds going out for physical editions they were going to have a major announcement on the project this fall.\n\nPersonally I'm assuming they're still working on it, because if there wasn't a game that was planned to release it'd be weird to only offer automatic refunds for physical collectors editions and not also the digital versions. I'm guessing that the years of delay, inflation, pandemic etc manufacturing physical knickknacks and statues and shit unprofitable. Hopefully whenever the game releases it's actually good, but time will tell.",

Hardsuit Labs has probably become toxic in the eyes of publishers, and with good reason.",

If development was deeply dysfunctional (which the facts we know sure do suggest) there probably isn't much there. More likely that a new studio will maybe take some design and concept work but start fresh from a code perspective.\n\nReminds me of the several abandoned iterations of Duke Nukem Forever.",

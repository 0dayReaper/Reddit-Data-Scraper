They still have the symptoms from the cancer of course, but they're not dealing with the side effects of chemo anymore, which can often be pretty bad. I hope TB was able to make the most of his last days with his family. RIP, TB.",

Her smiling to herself while everyone else at the table chuckled is probably the fondest memory we have of her last 20 or so years, and I hope TB had that last bit of strength to give everyone equally great memories before saying goodbye.",

Their age, chief complaint and other comorbid conditions, etc...usually the doctors are fairly good at judging a person's prognosis and we can plan their care from that point. Not to say they aren't ever wrong, but I have seen it go both ways. I've seen people get well enough to transfer to home so they can die there, I've seen people crash in mere hours. But if the prognosis is poor I always question that change in energy level if nothing else can really explain it medically.",

One day, he felt fine and was even sitting in his chair (as opposed to being in bed), and, the next, he was gone.  Me and my siblings were at school when it happened.  His body simply couldn't handle his heart disease (which he'd had for years) anymore, and it started shutting down.  Found out later that my dad, his son, had stayed up with him all that night.",

I'd been having severe hemorrhoids problems, and TB's cancer announcement lit a fire under me to actually have it checked out properly. They found FIVE pre-cancerous polyps in my guts, and removed them all long before they would have become a problem. \n\nBut if I'd waited until you're \"supposed\" to start getting colonoscopies? Who knows. TB may very well have saved my life. I wish I could have done the same for him. :(",

            "comment": "Holy hell, I can't believe it.\n\nI've watched TB since the early days of WoW. I got into the game when I was in junior high/high school, when the game was in Classic/BC. I didn't follow many online gaming news outlets. I mainly just got my news and game releases from my brother, who was out of college. Eventually, though, I got sucked into WoW. I also wanted something more from it. I started finding various communities and websites myself, and I eventually found my way to TotalBiscuit and WoW Radio.\n\nEventually, John left WoW behind, but he was still prominent on other fronts. He was a frontiersman in the young industry of gaming journalism. He never failed to always have a constant stream of content. Did a genuinely good PC game just launch? There was a video about it. Was a game running lower than 60fps? You bet your ass he complained about it. Was a game company acting dishonestly? John was there to breathe down their necks.\n\nThe man moved continents in every community he touched. If you're part of any big community built around a game, he likely touched that game, even for a little bit. He did a lot for League of Legends. He damn near built the SC2 community himself in its early days.\n\nI admit I haven't watched him as much as I used to, but if I was interested in a PC game, I always looked to see what he had to say about it. Hell, I even bought a Switch game (Mario + Rabbids) because of him. I'm scrolling down my Steam collection now. Games that he influenced my purchase of:\n\n* Awesomenauts\n* Banished\n* Bastion\n* Battleblock Theater\n* The Banner Saga\n* Blackguards\n* Blood Bowl\n* Braid\n* Broforce\n* Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons\n* Castle Crashers\n* C'thulhu Saves the World\n* FTL: Faster Than Light (my favorite PC game, also lead me to Into the Breach)\n* Game Dev Tycoon\n* Gunpoint\n* Hatoful Boyfriend\n* Legend of Grimrock (and Legend of Grimrock 2)\n* Magicka (and Magicka 2)\n* Octodad\n* Orcs Must Die\n* Orcs Must Die 2\n* Papers, Please\n* Pillars of Eternity\n* Retro City Rampage\n* Reus\n* Risk of Rain\n* Rogue Legacy\n* Sanctum\n* Space Run\n* SpaceChem\n* The Stanley Parable\n* Sunless Sea\n* Terraria\n* This War of Mine\n* Transistor\n* Transformers: War for Cybertron\n* Transformers: Fall of Cybertron\n* War for the Overworld\n* and, of course, WARHAMMER 40,000: SPACE MARINE\n\nI'd been preparing for the inevitable whenever the news broke at the start of May. I was sad when I saw this tweet, but after going through my Steam list, it hit me hard. I bought 6 shirts to support him after he broke the news. They're getting hella worn over the next couple of weeks. With E3 just around the corner as well, I'm going to really miss his Snarkathon takes on the press conferences.\n\nI'm not a religious person. However, if there is a God, hopefully, TB is giving him an earful right now about FoV sliders in Heaven.\n\nRest in peace, John Bain.",

I was curious and looked it up.  I later went through some testing to confirm that yes, that's wtf has been my problem since childhood.  \n\nFor as long as i can remember, i was told i was lazy and stupid because i had terrible handwriting or just could not manage shit.

            "comment": "The end of an era.\n\nI know writing a comment on the Internet doesn't mean much, but I want to put my piece out there.\n\nTotalbiscuit has done soo much for this industry, specifically PC gaming. He insisted for years that options matter on a platform that actually needs them, because every gamer is different.\n\nWithout him PC gaming would be worse. We are here, because people like him believed in the idea of choice and that people are rational.\n\nHe always stood for the rights of the consumer. The average young men and women who need to make informed decisions on the ever growing gaming market.\n\nHe put ethics before everything else. His phisophy evolved over the years to be as transparent and concise as possible. Even if his tastes didn't align with ours or vice versa, he always explained his stance, which was valuble. Because both perspectives on a matter yield the utlimate truth.\n\nHe made YouTube a better place for video gaming. Back when he started, gaming wasn't the predominant subject of YouTube. But we all saw that change years ago. Gaming in YouTube is hugely important for the industry as a whole and he did his part to ensure that viewers got a fair deal out of it.\n\nHis ethics and constant search of the best format to critique gaming has insipired many to do it as well.\n\nAnd I'm afraid to say there's a huge audience out there right now craving for honest and concise opinion based content. We will never fill the void that's left, but we can learn and grow.\n\nThis very much reminds of Rayn Davis' passing in 2013. 4 years and 2 months almost. TotalBiscuit followed GiantBomb and covered his passing in his Content Patch series. The passion with which he explained Davis' passing made me shed a tear about a website and a person I didn't follow or even knew about.\n\nIt made me pay attention to GB and eventually become a fan. Which eventually prompted me to start playing a small game called Project Reality where I've found life long friends, all because of a chain reaction caused by TB.\n\nI imagine some people will mourn TBs passing the way I did of Rayn Davis - you still feel the loss even if you didn't really follow TB.\n\nRayn Davis was one of the most charming and nicest people in the industry. He passed away prematurelly at the age of 34, very similar to TB. Taken away waay too soon. Waay before they could both come to their prime.\n\nJust like GB, it feels like TB was just starting his career. Just starting to break the big news, make a wider impact, but looking back, he already did way more than 99.99% of us will ever do.\n\nI think more of us should strive to be like TB. Start from pretty much nothing and just shoot for the stars. A lot of effort will be required, but if you don't try, you can't succeed.\n\nAnd to watch him do all of that while battling cancer to the bitter end, staying positive is perhaps something most of couldn't do at all.\n\nHis critique, commentary, advice and ethics will be missed.\n\nRIP BiscuitBear",

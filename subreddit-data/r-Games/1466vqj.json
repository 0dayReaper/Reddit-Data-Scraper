Some of them would be skilled enough to use the UEFN, and create more complex maps. The more those create, the more they intentionally learn about the Unreal Engine itself. Finally, a good fraction of them would become amateur UE programmers/designers, to create their own independent games, in which they are likely to publish on the EGS, and have zero licensing costs",

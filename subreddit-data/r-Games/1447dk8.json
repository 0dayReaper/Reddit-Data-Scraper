On one side of the spectrum you have YandereDev, who gobbled together his creepy wet dream fantasy game out of Else If commands due to not giving a shit about learning even basic level skills, that results in development hell and a buggy unfinished moneypit game. And then you have this madlad, who painstakingly handpainted the shadows across the whole world, because although he doesn't have the ability (yet) to put in a lightbox system, but his vision and inspiration is so pure and clear that he does it anyway and achieves peak athmosphere, even improving on the performance of the game a bit",

Northern Journey is a fantastic game that definitely deserves the eyes Mandalore will put on it.\n\nIt's the kind of game that feels inspired more by the creator actually going outside than by copying other games. The presentation and gameplay flip between being shockingly immersive, and being way clunkier than most standard games these days \u2013 but it's not *more* clunky so much as it just makes *different* compromises from what most games have settled on. This makes it a profoundly unique experience, where you often look at the environments trying to figure out where to go in a way most games don't require you to, and approach combat in a genuinely cautious and careful way instead of running and gunning.\n\nIt's also just hilarious. I grew to love the way everyone in the world is just bluntly like \"fuck you, do what I tell you\" or \"fuck you, i'll help you but only because I think it'll be funny to see you fail.\"",

It might actually be my personal favorite of that description, due to the fact that I could play it right out of the box without a need for fan patches, or a wiki open to get a bearing on the basics (I'm looking at you Gothic and Pathologic). \n\n  \nBut excluding all Eurojank talk, its a very solid game and, like how Mandalore compares it, reminded me of the first time playing Morrowind where I immediately got sucked into exploring the world so I could find more of it's weird natural formations and wild \"animals\". The trailers had me worried that I wouldn't like the weapons too much, but they ended up adding to the overall tension due to their slow fire rates and slow projectile speeds. I wouldn't say the combat is as solid as what is seen in DUSK or Doom, but there is much more to this game than just shooting and walking around pretty areas despite my first impressions.\n\nGlad to see Mandalore talk about it and give it a greater spotlight. I saw a few mentions of it around here from time to time but I think this will be enough to elevate it into the Core Eurojank category when people talk about it in the future.",

But the combat is just trash that's so bad the game literally TELLS you to save scum it in the beginning. Which is compounded to be even worse when you get caught on ever little pebble, half of which are invisible. And while your kiteing enemies around while backpedaling you need to watch out for one-hit-kill water hazards. How are these different from safe water? You have to stare at it for 2 seconds and wait for a UI element to appear on the surface of the water. Real easy to do while strafing like crazy away from the worlds deadliest flea that somehow kills you in 3 hits with no cool-down on its attacks.\n\nThis reeks of a game that needed play-testing and a second person on the dev team to snap the auteur who made it back to reality. It's got great potential, but as it is, it's not fun ... in fact very frustrating.",

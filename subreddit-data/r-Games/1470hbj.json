Things like the mass transit dlc, or the one that adds seasons, or loads of others. It's weird that they're paid stuff and a bit money grabby. DLC for games like this should mainly consist of unique buildings/cosmetic stuff, like a London DLC where you get placeable buildings like Big Ben and buses can look like London ones, not actual core gameplay mechanic changes. People hate on the Sims for too much DLC but at least those are normally mainly cosmetic and silly changes.\n\nButtt theres a million mods that add wayyy more than all the DLCs combined anyway. Hopefully the second game is as moddable.",

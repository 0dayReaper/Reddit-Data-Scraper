In 1975 these guys had a truly cutting-edge, next-generation gaming prototype... but by the time they managed to get it to market, it was already falling behind, and got totally eclipsed by companies who followed along just a year or two later.\n\nIn hindsight, the Fairchild probably never had a realistic chance of succeeding, although there's no way the devs at the time could have known that.",

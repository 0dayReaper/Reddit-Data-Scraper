Is it anything ground breaking? No. But I\u2019d argue it\u2019s the equivalent of Futurama\u2019s game that everyone loves to call the lost episode. Neither game is outstanding, but gives a lot of fun for those who liked the series and wanted something a bit more from it.",

Valve quickly pulled the title, but the keys still worked and it's still in my library.  If I try to link to the store page, people without it get an error - not even a \"this is no longer for sale\" like some other delisted titles.  But the game still shows on my profile under games played by time and is still accessible on my account.\n\nOnly reason I think they'd pull a hand from libraries is if the seller never had the legal right to sell it in the first place.",

If it wasn't, then whatever maybe it was just these guys. But these episodes were pushed out one per month August through December 2008, and even being a newbie to the point and click genre, I could tell these games were rushed products. It felt like a bunch of scenes and events were missing from every episode. I really only played because of the funny scenarios. \n\nSeeing as H*R content is limited to maybe one cartoon a year now, if you are a fan longing for the good old update every Monday feeling and have never played these (or watched a walkthrough) I would recommend them. The writing and comedy make up for much of the faults.\n\nOne final note, the PC version is glitchy and messing with the settings isn't going to stop characters' eyes from disappearing (unless there is a user fix for that bug by now?).",

The Telltale Monkey Island series was...okay at best.  It felt like someone writing Monkey Island fanfiction, who didn't have the same voice or understanding of the material as the original team.  Which I mean, on a bigger scale, is exactly what it was.",

I think it is safe to say that Ron Gilbert thought somewhat the same, because while Escape is referenced in Return, any of the retcons the game made were removed. In Tales, I think the addition of mermaids was a bit much, but a Leviathan made sense.\n\nAnd while I enjoyed Return, I did feel Elaine was very 'nice' in it, rather than the outspoken sometimes quick to anger Elaine we saw in the other games.",

Wasn't a fan of the move into 3D, and the humor was kinda awkward.\n\nThey're all better than Return though.  I was so excited, but I just could not get into it.  I know there was a huge awful harassment campaign from angry gamers with threats and stuff, and it was absolutely uncalled for.  But at the end of the day, yeah I really hated that art style too.  And the humor was just not really what it used to be.\n\nTo me, Curse Of Monkey Island is peak Monkey Island.  The art style was phenomenal, I wish they'd kept it like that.  Hell, that art style was so good it made me desperately wish for a Monkey Island animated series!",

The Brothers Chaps had offers, but none that let them retain ownership and merchandising. They got a development deal with Disney and ended up creating Two More Eggs for Disney XD, which has a fair amount of Homestar references.",

The fact that they just made their own website rather than submit their toons to somewhere like Newgrounds, had no ads or paid content and only made money through merchandise, and depended pretty much entirely on word of mouth to attract people...it should have failed horribly, but instead it became the longest-running show in Internet history.",

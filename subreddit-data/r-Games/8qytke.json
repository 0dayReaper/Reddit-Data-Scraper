The tables turned from last gen to this gen (Michael Soft -&gt; Sony), and it can happen again if people are tired of Sony's BS.\n\nIt sucks.

First is they can't afford a console. The second is because their PC is much more powerful than a console. There is nothing Sony can do to make either group migrate over to PS4. One group simply can't because they can't afford it. The other group might be made to buy a console for exclusives but you simply will not be able to make them play anything on PS4 that is available on PC because there's nothing you can do to beat out the hardware advantage of PC.\n",

The lead is a lead, but it is not as solidified as people pretend. And adding Windows 10 sales/PC makes the lead even more irrelevant and diminishing.\n\nThe Top 10 Exclusives for Xbox*/PS4 are likely close to the following, despite the PS4 having double the console base:\n\n1. Uncharted 4 - [12+ Million](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/05/ces-2017-uncharted-4-sold-through-87-million-copies-in-2016) - ~15%\n2.

Forza: Horizon 3* - [9+ Million](https://www.windowscentral.com/forza-horizon-3-crosses-9-million-players-xbox-one-and-pc) ~22.5%@\n4. Horizon:Zero Dawn - [8+ Million](https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2018/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-surpasses-7-6-million-sales-worldwide-ahead-of-its-1st-birthday/) - ~9.38%\n5. Gears 4* - [6.5+ Million](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/6u44vg/the_coalition_accidentally_revealed_64million/) - ~16.25%@\n6. The Last of Us: Remastered - [6.5+ million](http://www.vgchartz.com/game/80977/the-last-of-us/) - ~8.13%\n7. God of War - [5+ Million](https://blog.us.playstation.com/2018/05/03/god-of-war-sells-over-3-1-million-units-in-3-days-becomes-fastest-selling-ps4-exclusive/) - ~6.25%\n8. PUBG* (Timed) - [5+ Million](https://sanvada.com/2018/03/20/five-million-players-pubg-xbox-one-amazing/) - ~12.5%\n9. Sea of Thieves* - [4+ million](https://youtu.be/E6GAxUVs37c) - ~10%@\n10. Halo: MCC* - [3.5+ Million](https://www.vg247.com/2015/07/14/halo-series-hits-65-million-units-sold/) - ~8.75%\n\n\n* @ - Indicates a Play Anywhere Title and thus unknown total userbase to calculate true attachment rate. Number shown is as if all were XboxOne. Metric becomes meaningless when PC sales added.\n\n* The only times I've used VGChartz is The Last of Us: Remastered as we haven't had numbers or clues in 4 years and I think it's likely it is somewhere close to their numbers.  I've avoided them whenever possible.\n\n* Games close to this list may include Grand Turismo Sport and Bloodborne both in the 3-3.5 million zone from last reported numbers.  I expect the iffy dance in spots 9/10 to end soon with Spiderman and Forza Horizon 4 coming this fall.\n\n* The only numbers that technically include GamePass totals is Gears 4 and Sea of Thieves. Though how many that includes is unknown.  More importantly, GamePass as a way to wave away numbers is ironically pointless. If nothing else, people being able to play these games for Free-$10 a month is still a better value to customers than having to buy it. The fundamental question we're trying to gage off these numbers is not how much money the companies made, but how many people want to play these exclusive  games? But if you subscribe to the theory that everyone who does so, logged in to the menu once for 30 sec and went \"This is shit, even if free\" then you have a narrative you will die on no matter what I show you. I could point out that I could open the Detroit game case and go \"This is shit\" without ever even opening it. You could argue going forward Sony games would have higher numbers if they had a GamePass too. You'd be right. But they don't. 30 hours of God of War is no different than 30 hours of Thieves. So this is still how many people played these games.  How many people were interested in and were able to play the exclusives of that system?  That's what this list shows you.\n",

But Epic deserves some scrutiny too for not clearly communicating the fact that linking your PSN account would permanently fuck your account if you want to play on other platforms. I know now that this was written in the fine print, but the whole situation is very consumer-unfriendly. At this point I don't even care if my progress moves over to my switch, but it's a huge pain to have to create a new account and re-add all my friends (not my PS4 friends though).

I know it sucks to be locked because it was like this for Xbox for awhile as well but then Epic and Microsoft agreed to open the cross save and crossplay.\n\nThough we gamers can't do much about the situation at the moment besides hope this gains traction and Sony hears us out.

When the cd was played on the computer it installed 2 programs one of which would install even if you did not accept the TOS.\n\nOne program sent information back to sony about the users listening habits the other would install in the background and it's main purpose was to hide both programs so the user wouldn't know they existed and made it harder to uninstall. This one used open source software that opened the user up to malware. The programs ran constantly in the background and sent info to sony about what you were listening to and so slowed down your machine drastically.\n\nSony then, after months of denying any issue, released a program that would uninstall the programs from the users machines. All the uninstaller did was unhide the initial program then installed yet more software that sent yet more information back to Sony about the user.\n",

I think Sony is doing a great job this generation but scummy moves should always be pointed at. \n\nI am glad this happened because this means they will be forced to stop being dicks, or face a huge backlash with the PS5, and we all know what happened last time ~~Microsoft~~ a certain company decided not to allow cross compatibility",

Sony flat out refused to give me my money back &amp; if I issued a charge-back I risked all the games I had bought for PS3/PS4 &amp; trophies\n\nI wasn't going to play them for the time being, but it's still a lot of content to have taken away so I ate it, fuck Sony",

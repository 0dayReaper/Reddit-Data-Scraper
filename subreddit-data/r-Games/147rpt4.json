It looks fine, but I feel like there was an opportunity to make it a truly unique game instead of having yet another Far Cry clone. \n\nImagine a game where you play a human who uploads into a Navi, like in the movies, and there are certain areas of the open world you can only access as one of those forms. You work as a double agent for the Navi, and you can leave clues or unlock doors for you to use later when you're back in Navi form. That would have been unique and very interesting from a gameplay and narrative standpoint. \n\nInstead we get this.",

The graphics were especially underwhelming IMO. Outlaws looked much better to me and it's made by the same studio. Character models also looked a bit dated, especially the eyes.\n\nI'll wait on more information to make a final call on the gameplay. The flying could be cool, but at a glance, it seemed very similar to Hogwart's Legacy and it got boring pretty fast in that game. The open world traversal was the best part, although I'm not sur how big a role it would play. Combat is basically copy pasted from Far Cry.\n\nEdit : To be clear, when I'm referring to Hogwart's Legacy, I'm talking about flying with the hippogriff, not with broom.",

God of War Ragnarok for example, or even some Far Cry games. Getting the grapple allowed you to go to places you couldn't go before. Just add a little more depth to it and make it based on the size difference between humans and Navi. \n\nAlso, niche? I mean that is literally the premise of the movies. It would be exactly what people who don't necessarily game a lot would expect, while still providing something new for gamers.\n\nApart from the combat, which admittedly is much cooler in Horizon, they're pretty similar games IMO. The open world structure is almost the same.",

And we\u2019ve found over the years that we haven\u2019t been particularly good at the self-publishing side, but we\u2019ve been great at the licensing side which obviously doesn\u2019t require that much allocation of capital.\n\n&gt; \u201cSince we\u2019re allocating capital in other directions \u2026 we\u2019ve just decided that the best place for us to be in that space is licensing and not publishing.

The combat looked like a standard 3rd person cover shooter with no real X-factor - like Uncharted 1/2 level simple.  Space combat - looked stiff.  Speeder fight - looked stiff.  There was a clear lack of flow to movement, combat and vehicles that made the game seem dull.  It's the sort of dullness open world games like Fallout can get away with because deep systems compensate for shallow gameplay.  Nothing about this demo made me feel like there would be some sort of 'deep' system(s) to offset the blandness.  Binary conversation options, no indication of RPG elements - I'm worried we will get a super boring, middle-of-the-road 3rd person adventure game set in the Star Wars universe.",

You're saying it's \"clearly\" an open world game, yet literally the first and only gameplay we've seen was of a linear story mission. \n\nUbisoft said it's open world, sure.

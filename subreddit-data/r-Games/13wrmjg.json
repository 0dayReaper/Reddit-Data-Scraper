This is on top of borrowing DIO\u2019s knife trick. The oki applications of the booby traps are obvious, but AU Diego also had a handgun and a horse in the manga, allowing for more conventional projectiles and a stance system. AU Diego also pulled a stunt where he fired his handgun from an Johnny\u2019s front while attacking with his stand from behind, which could easily be adapted into a side switch.\n\nIf they\u2019re feeling bold they could adapt AU Diego\u2019s fangirl meat shields. If they\u2019re feeling really, really bold they could give him a super where he cuts off his leg and throws it at the opponent to transfer TUSK\u2019s super spin onto them.",

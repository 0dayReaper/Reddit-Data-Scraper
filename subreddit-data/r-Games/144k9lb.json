Could be a story where there is an all out war between everyone over a discovery or other political agenda.\n\nFederation could get a bonus towards quicker amalgamation due to kindness, and they'd have less revolts. Maybe the klingons use fear to quell an uprising but favour towards them takes longer so planets/regions are slower to fully assimilate.",

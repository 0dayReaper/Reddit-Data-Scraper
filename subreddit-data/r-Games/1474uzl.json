However, this time you are free to carve out your path. You have a ship and a crew, and you\u2019ve broken out from under the corporation and gang that owned you. You're autonomous\u2014for as long as your decaying body keeps functioning and the hunters on your heels don\u2019t catch you.\n\n&gt;\"Your ship will be your haven, your tool, and your primary means of survival,\" developer Jump Over the Age says. \"You\u2019ll need to maintain it and use it to navigate the habitats of the belt. Take on contracts, improvise solutions, and gather a crew of richly drawn characters to help you create a refuge for the lost among the stars.\" \n\n\nMost unexpected announcement for me, and the one that got me most excited!\n\nCan't wait to see what new adventures and characters we explore!",

The writing only added to the surreal-ness.\n\nIt was unforgettable. Always appreciate games trying to evoke different kind of feeling like that.",

            "comment": "KRZ is one of those games that either click with you and you love it - or it doesn't and you detest it.\n\nI can't quite explain why I fell in the first category but the game, as this article's writer said, evoke feelings similar to those you get watching a Lynch movie. Its uncanniness and slow burn philosophical journey are second to none, especially when you consider that choices you make are all irrelevant game-wise and serve only for you to figure out the characters *by yourself*. The only game that also nailed this \"self discovery\" feeling through inconsequential choices for me was South of the Circle. \n\nThe only aspect I kinda disliked (and won't be touching in future playthroughs) is the Route 0 driving minigame to spot landmarks. It's too much of a hassle for just a few bits of incremental story.",

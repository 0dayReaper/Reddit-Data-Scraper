It's stupid.\n\nThen I played payday 1 and oh my god it's actually a better game, no stupid characters, well paced waves of enemies, few silly classes of enemies that take you out of the experience, and every singly cop is an actual threat you actually want to be behind cover in most situations, it's a much harder game because of it but it really does help capture the 'heat' movie better than payday 2.\n\nTLDR: payday 2 became complete shit, but payday 1 has aged very well and it's a much better game.",

This is a sort of \"Left 4 Dead 1 is better than Left 4 Dead 2\" type of situation, the sequels have more of everything, but what the OG games had is infinitely more polished than anything the sequels can offer.",

A good example in the game currently would be that C4 can be used as tripwires to mark patrolling guards in stealth, or blow up targets in Loud (as well as using shaped charges to quickly open safes and doors)",

I think Payday 3 should really allow players to complete every mission using stealth. Getting caught shouldn't kick off the action, you should be allowed to save the heist by rectifying your mistake. \n\nSo if you get caught, they shouldn't send a fleet of squad cars to the bank for example, they should send just one car and have a lone police officer check out the bank. Since the game does allow you to pick your own skills two of the skills should focus on crowd control and diplomacy. \n\nSo one guy is able to shepherd the civilians into a back room, take their phones off them, lock the room and stand guard, whilst another guy can talk to the police officer and defuse the situation by saying it was a false alarm. Even if you're playing with the AI you should be able to give each AI teammate a certain skillset so that they actually work together as a team.\n\nIt shouldn't automatically turn into a Heat-esque shootout, especially if you're playing solo. I'm mainly a solo player and there was quite a few heists in Payday 2 that were fucking impossible on your own. I'd like to be able to solo every single heist in stealth if possible.",

Sure you can do either better with a dedicated build, but it can make some heists a lot easier to be able to bypass a couple loud objectives by stealthing halfway through. But it's mission-dependent, because others do just start the \"loud heist\" from the beginning even if you got 90% through the stealth approach.",

None of the systems for stealth were what I\u2019d call refined, that\u2019s for sure, but they were unique.\n\nIn most other stealth games you\u2019re slinking around in the dark. You do that in Payday too, but a large part of a lot of stealthing levels had you had to make a presence and do crowd control, which I don\u2019t know, I just found really really fun.\n\nUsually before you could do that though, you had to take out security systems that trigger the police call, and this kind of felt like a puzzle that sometimes was near impossible but it was fun to me nonetheless.\n\nFor example you need to take out a guard, so you need to get his route and take him out somewhere where you know you\u2019ll have time to \u201cdisarm\u201d the walkie call.  Finding the key to or drilling the security room was also another bit of the puzzle, usually.\n\nBut in addition, you had to manage your resources well to pull off a successful stealth run. You had to pick out the correct guards to take out as too many causes suspicion. You had to pick who to tie up, and where to use jammers.\n\nThen sometimes you needed your loot logistics planned out well, if you didn\u2019t subdue the entire location.\n\nI don\u2019t know. It all come together usually as a really hard puzzle box. The slight randomness meant plans couldn\u2019t stay exactly same every time, which kept things interesting. \n\nI really do think that despite the jank and unapproachable nature of PD2\u2019s stealth, it really did do something pretty unique.",

I imagine we'll get more details closer to release.\n\nIt also seems like shooting special enemies in specific locations causes area denial effects that could be useful.",

Assets arent engine things, and optimizing assets dependant on hardware (or engine) isn't a new thing. \n\nThe reality is they fucked up, they didn't adapt their tools for the goals they set themselves (release on console) and then leadership dropped any support when they realized they put their tram and project on quicksand.\n\nJust like The Walking Dead.\n\nUnless they show something substantial, approach with care",

            "comment": "ESO was always a decent game for the Elder Scrolls voiced characters and lore, but it feels like a dying game since Microsoft don\u2019t want to inject more budget, expanded team and life into it.\n\nEspecially overhauling the broken combat and more free content updates to match the yearly paid dlc since the micro transactions are so high priced.\n\nI\u2019m glad fans can enjoy it, it was just never what I\u2019m looking for in the online Elder Scrolls I was hoping it\u2019d be and it\u2019ll still be several years until ES6.",

    "postText": "I love the FF franchise, and 7 is my favorite game of all time and I love the remake. Through my life, I've dabbled with but never completed 8, 9 , 10, and 15. In the case of 8, I love the characters and story but I just really don't like the draw system. In cases of 9, 10, and 15, I've heard of how amazing they are but I just can't get far in them at this time in my life because of work and adulting. Since I never beat them as a kid, it's hard for me to get fully invested and beat the entire game.\n\nI liked GBA's FF Tactics Advance because of how low-scale but still fun story. I'm really hoping it comes out on VC.  I tried FF Tactics for playstation recently and couldn't get into the story. \n\nI most recently tried FF15's mobile version and I like the thought of how shortened it is, but the gameplay was so boring and unfulfilling. \n\nDo FF 1-6 or Crystal chronicles fit what I might be looking for? A shorter, more stream-lined experience that won't be a months of trekking to get through?\n\nThere very well could be no game that fits what I'm looking for, which is acceptable. I figured I'd get others insight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks",

The plot isn\u2019t anything special, but where it really shines is the Job System that gives a ton of customization and depth to your party.\n\nFF1 is also short. But it\u2019s hard for me to recommend.",

Sure it's not overly dense like modern RPGs, and it's more like a classic tabletop type of story translated to video games, but it's still kinda wild for the NES.",

FF9 and FF10 are also pretty short for RPGs, so long as you stick to the main story and don't bother with side content (which can definitely extend the playtime by a lot). \n \nIf it doesn't *have* to be FF, just a JRPG, then check out the first 2 Dragon Quest games, both of which clock under 20 hours.",

Because their seems to be no running between every town, or through an open world, it will likely cut down a lot of bloat and extra time spent.\n\nThe story is also really incredible so far. I finished the demo and left really impressed.",

It's a bit shorter than the FF7 and later games (according to how long to beat, it clocks in at something like 20 hours to beat the game).\n\nFF6 is my personal favorite of the 2D era (again, if you're cool with pixel graphics), but is a bit longer.\n\nAnd if you want a slightly more experimental game that's also a bit shorter, you could look into the Live A Live remake -- it's not a FF game, but was originally made by Squaresoft in the SNES era with a lot of people who worked on FF/Chrono Trigger so it has a bit of the same DNA.",

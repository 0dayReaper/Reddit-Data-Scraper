They'd essentially have to make multiverse copies of nearly all the levels if they wanted to give the player that level of freedom. I suppose that's where procedural or AI generated content might be helpful in setting the framework for those type of changes on the fly. But changes in the level design, artwork, and scripting (tied to the storytelling aspects) would still need to be done by real people spending countless hours.",

What makes me excited is the fact this game is not really a FPS like Bioshock, it's not like we are going to rewind stuff to use it in frenetic combat or anything... it's a rpg, it's like Steampunk Fallout. That's a cool concept in my pov, I love the steampunk visuals and the story, but Bioshock has issues with it's gameplay (let us be frank, the games are great, but the gameplay has problems), I wish Bioshock was a rpg instead, imagine you role playing in Rapture, searching for items, talking with the NPCs, customizing the playable character, leveling up perks, etc.. that's more interesting than shooting and special powers imo",

This game takes place in a magical world that's experiencing an industrial revolution, but the catch is magic nearby makes machines act up.\n\n[A good solid overview of the game](https://youtu.be/HMUugZ3DxH8).\n\n[A joke review of the game](https://youtu.be/QXAPdwOza9U).\n\nI desperately wish this game got a modern remake that fixed some of the balance issues and ran better on newer systems. The mods and fixes help a ton and are good enough for most people but it's not perfect.",

Bloodlines 1? Arcanum? Yep this team is comprised of key people that made all those games.\n\n\n2. \"It's a rip off of Bioshock!\" No disrespect but Chad Moore and Jason Anderson( leads of this game) have put out industry defining games even before Bioshock existed. Don't insult them by saying they're ripping off Bioshock.\n\n\n3. Why do I sound like a salty fanboy? Because I am. I love these people and this studio and I hope people realize how much they've influenced 90% of the games you love.\n\n\n4. It's gonna be awesome.",

Really liked this showcase, it was solid, that would convince me to buy a Xbox Series S just for gamepass... if I didn't had a PC already (who needs a upgrade by the way, my old warrior GTX 1060 is getting older). Also, there's already performance issues related with the Series S, this console looks like a potato, but still, to buy it cheap for like $250 and only use gamepass on it, that's a genuinely good deal, Sony and Nintendo don't offer anything close (talking about consumer friendly deals)",

The levels look cool and the boss designs they showed in the trailer look visually interesting but everything falls apart with the core gameplay mechanics. You never shake the feeling you're playing a cheap imitation of a better product (ie Bloodborne). \n\nI got the same feeling from Atomic Heart. Visuals look really engaging but once you actually get your hands on the controller it just becomes so obvious that it does not feel polished to play",

Kinda reminds me of that game Lies Of P and how it really clearly rips from Bloodborne.\n\nThis game could be good but I don't think we'll end up getting something that feels as polished as Infinite in regards to its gunplay or enemy design - the latter feels forgettable here, like generic Unreal assets or something. \n\nIt's interesting to see the public's perception of BioShock Infinite change as the years go by, I remember really enjoying the art-direction but I was really let down when it came to the gameplay - and it seems like a lot of other people in the BioShock fandom are starting to feel the same. 1 and 2 are fantastic games - I really like how in levels in Fort Frolic, the player is presented with a hub area with a lot of smaller side areas to explore at their own pace - the feeling of parts coming together to form a whole felt super satisfying and was really missing from Infinite's more coridoor-shooter level design. Infinite was plagued by technical issues/over-ambition and I get why they needed to scale it back but the end product we ended up with was disappointing from a gameplay standpoint. \n\nJudging by this trailer, I don't think the devs are taking the Immersive-sim approach and are instead leaning more into the scripted linear style which is a shame because we are at the point with current tech that the true vision of Infinite can be realized (like with the seamless dimension hopping in that recent Ratchet And Clank game) - I'd like to know more about how the level design is going to be handled in this game. Hopefully I'm wrong and it ends up being more like Prey 2017 than BioShock Infinite. \n\nAs it stands though, I'm skeptical of this and it kind of comes across as a cash-grab to cash in on the BioShock niche.\n\nI'm skeptical of Ken's new game too - it's kinda odd that he shut down Irrational, said that he wanted to make a smaller, different game than Bioshock and then proceeds to make what looks like a spiritual successor to Bioshock. \n\nThis might be a HOT TAKE but people in the industry like Ken Levine, Hideo Kojima, Chris Roberts, John Romero and others that are considered auteurs of the medium are geniuses within their own skillsets but are pretty lackluster project leads. They usually are the most successful when they have someone else working alongside them at the same time throughout production to reign them back a bit.",

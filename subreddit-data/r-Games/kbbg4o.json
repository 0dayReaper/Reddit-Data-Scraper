                    "comment": "I think the general point of the article is: Many studios treat employees like crap, and the Awards is one of the many ways these studios get, well, rewarded for that behavior. And although I understand the awards are about appreciating the final product, thus honoring the devs, I guess Kotaku suggests we can kinda make a statement with these awards regarding the practices within the industry. \n\nPerhaps a weird comparison: Many people agree Apple makes great products, but they had used (I believe it stopped now) indirect child laborers to make their products. The product might be great but do you understand some organization that hands out Technology Awards might feel a tad uneasy on handing an award to a company that does that?\n\nThat's obviously a fairly extreme example, but the general point is the same: Should we be handing out awards to studios that exploit people? In a way it normalizes and kinda idiolizes that idea of crunchtime. Like: 'This is what's needed to be succesful'. It might result in a good game but at what cost? People that can barely spend time with their family?\n\nI'm digressing a bit but it reminds me of Hitchcock. Brilliant director, utter asshole. He didn't care about hurting and half traumatizing his actress in \"The Birds\", as long as he got a good take. 'Yea nice movie dude, but damn. Is this really the way we want to make movies?'",

The graphics don't impress as much as they thought it should and the response is overwhelmingly \"Ugh, fucking lazy devs, just coasting on the name of their game\", when in reality those developers are probably working 70 hours a week. Then the next day they're ready to sign a petition or do some empty meaningless anti-crunch action against Naughty Dog or Rockstar or CDPR, just because those companies' crunch habits have become public. It's so hypocritical.",

                                    "comment": "Honestly, thats why crunch needs to be addressed uniformly across the industry through laws or major successes in unionization.\n\n Thats my take on a lot of things tbh, but the only other arguments I hear range from implausible to just  shrugging. I get why people shrug, but its pretty ironic that a game called Cyberpunk, a term I associate with the Shadowrun series, is creating dystopian levels of corporate bullshit wrapped around cool tech ideas. Its a bit on the nose here I think.\n\nAlso, they didnt allow reviewers to show footage they recorded. This meant that more or less the only footage they had of the game was of curated PR footage. That needs to fucking stop too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****Everything past here is mostly me rambling, so uh keep that in mind or stop reading. Were a few comments from the top post in so it feels like its prime soapbox territory. Might edit it more later.***\n\nCDPR specifically stated that they wouldnt crunch. They had a reputation for consumer rights with drm free games on GoG. The Witcher TV puts this game in the spotlight from the non-gamer dark fantasy crowd. \n\nTheres a lot of really good work out of Eastern Europe with low budget video games and they could have set the bar for that whole region, cementing a reliable source of talent by being the most comfortable places to work for in a 1000 miles. More specifically its my understanding that the book series The Witcher is like a cultural icon in Poland, but I may be overselling their influence. Big stands by internationally recognized brands could set trends beyond their industry in their locality. Like the country of New Zealand has a major industry off of people associating their countryside with Middle-Earth and imo whoever holds the rights to that IP really has a strange amount of influence in how the movie industry as a whole functions in New Zealand for example. I know the leader of Poland gifted Obama a copy of the Witcher 3 but I dont really know if the company really cares about the people of Poland or vice versa.\n\n\n I think long term investment into branding themselves as a pro-labor company might be a good idea in general, as well as a moral thing with wealth inequality being what it is, but if its a bean counting/corporate thing moral or long term arguments dont matter as much.",

But yeah, I suppose delay is what is required.. but not sure if some form of crunch is avoidable in these creative industries towarda the very, very, end. Vfx, game deevelopment.. maybe some form of change is required where the directors cant call for a changes after some point or something? Hard to say.. crunches are not the way, but often times you cant avoid it no matter the planning if the deadline is unmovable due to budget and the product has to come out.",

Some junk items have been hard to pick up from weird placement like under a mat, but that's not even worth being counted as a bug. No noticable frame rate issues if I've even had any, and I am a dude who is adamant a solid 60 or close to it at least or a game looks wonky to me. Maybe I'm lucky but hopping over to the cyberpunk subreddit makes it look like the greatest hardware in the world can't run the game at more than 15fps. \n\nMy experience doesn't compare to console players obviously but it doesn't seem like it's this hopeless piece trash. Some updates and a quality of life or two patches would be nice to smooth out any complaints I've had.",

But for the love of god, let me criticize something, let me DISLIKE something without being called a stinky woman-hating neckbeard internet-warrior degenerate.

Hell, they probably don't even represent 10% of it.\n\nThe average, normie gamer usually just finds out about a game watching trailers and gameplays, and from that they decide whether they'll buy it or not. Then they buy it, play it, and that's it. I can assure you a huge amount of people who played TLOU2 don't even know this game is hated so much on the internet. Hell, they probably don't even know who Neil Druckmann is. That's why negative public perception didn't hurt TLOU2 and it'll probably won't affect Cyberpunk either, because that perception exists mostly in the internet gaming community.\n\nAs for your edit, yeah, a huge circlejerk centered around hating Cyberpunk has been formed after release. While CDPR definitely deserves criticism and the game needs to be fixed, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. It's not different from a Bethesda game at launch. Obviously each person has a different experience with bugs, but mine has been fine so far, just small visual glitches.",

If it's \"Best (organizational) Direction\" then, and only then, do things like crunch, delays, marketing, fan service/community, etc. come into play.\n\nSo which is this award looking for, best creative direction or best organizational direction?",

They also had to write bug reports for that game, not samples for any game. It took about a week for most people to reach the required point in the game.\n\nWith the jobs being remote, and maybe only one person being hired for such a small team, there was presumably a not insignificant number of people buying Hades and essentially working as free QA for one week. Supergiant could then take all of those professionally written bug reports and act on them.\n\nIt didn't bother me at the time, but the longer I think about it, the more unethical and potentially illegal that seems. If it was a large studio doing this in the hiring process, there would have been outrage.",

Managers and higher ups need to make sure devs don't crunch by encouraging them to leave at a normal time and managing the workload properly.",

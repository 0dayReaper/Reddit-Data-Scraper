Obviously it's got a lot of metaphorical thematic weight but the story works even when you read it straight as presented, i.e., an ancient pict woman who happens to have psychosis also actually travels to hell to get her lover's soul back from death.",

They probably could've gotten some interest from people if they gave some insight into what's going on.  Even as someone who played the first game for the first time last month, I'm a little lost.",

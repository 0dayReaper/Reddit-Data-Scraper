Rockstar said that they developed the PC version of GTA V alongside the console versions separately. It has it's own technical foundation and wasn't just ported over from console like GTA IV was (which in comparison was a horrible port). I wouldn't be surprised if RDR2 for PC isn't a port either but was individually developed.",

Although it was supposed to come shortly after the \"next gen\" console versions, it was postponed a few times due to polish. \n\nI think it was a mix of both. They actually tripple dipped as some people bought it for old gen, new-gen consoles and then for PC again. I do believe that their initial plan was to release it alongside the new gen console versions though and they just realized during development that it wasn't polished and optimized enough yet and postponed it a couple of times. Sure you could say it was their plan all along, but then they could have just announced the PC release to be 6 month after the new-gen console versions from the beginning.",

Was there anything different this time around?\n\nKevin Hoare\u2014president of Rockstar Toronto: The process of bringing GTA 5 to PC was most similar to our last PC title, Max Payne 3. Our process of bringing titles to PC has evolved over the years. We knew that we would eventually create a PC version so early development was done in parallel with the console versions. In fact, some of the early preparations we made for PC, like 64 bit &amp; DX11 support, paid off very handsomely when the PS4 and Xbox One architectures were announced. That early work made the process of transitioning to the new consoles a lot easier and allowed us to hit the ground running. The artists also prepared for PC by authoring their source art at PC-ready resolutions, even though we had to use massively reduced versions for the PS3 and XB360.\n\nIt is still amazing to think how we took a last-gen game that, at the time, was something we were extremely happy with in terms of looks and performance, saw new console versions of that world and were blown away at all the added detail we could show, and now we get to see that same game scale to 4kat 60fps, which is just beyond anything we have experienced as developers. We have aimed to retain that ability to scale the performance for the PC game so players with different hardware platforms can benefit from that as well.\"\n\nSource: https://www.pcgamer.com/rockstar-talk-4k-pc-performance-and-more/",

This whole 'port' concept is a thing of the past, there's no 'porting to pc' anymore, except perhaps if an engine was written for e.g. opengl/ps4 and needs a d3d target now, you have to add that render pipeline, and that's some work, but 10 to 1 the shaders are written in a higherlevel language that can compile to hsl and gsl for instance.",

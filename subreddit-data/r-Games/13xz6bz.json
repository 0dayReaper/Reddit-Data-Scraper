That would've been the optimal time to release them, with the hype for TotK at its peak and no actual game to play in sight yet. Releasing them after might lead to TotK players feeling like they already have enough, since selling TotK to people who just played ports of old games is a lot easier than the other way around. I think the unfortunate reality is just that we're not going to see ports of them on Switch.",

If you look at the Wikipedia page for Switch sales records, you can see it outsold Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (and 3), Mario + Rabbids, Fire Emblem Engage. It's right below Metroid Dread in sales. I know it's considerably older than some of these titles, but calling it a flop is a big exaggeration. \n\n\n&gt; as a new IP it didn\u2019t reach the height as Splatoon 1.\n\n \nThat's a huge milestone.

If Splatoon 1 hadn't been, do you think they would have carved out staff from the Animal Crossing studio to make a sequel? AC New Horizons was a pretty big hit but they still dedicated staff to Splatoon 3 because it's also a new hit series for them, despite seeing lesser sales.\n\nARMS never had the same success as Splatoon, in terms of sales or cultural impact. It has done little to warrant a sequel the way Splatoon did.",

Why make a sequel to a game that nobody found exciting or interesting or even worthy of discussion after a few days? I can't believe there's a lot of developer passion behind it. I sincerely doubt the 1-2 Switch team were just so enamored with that project and were just brimming with ideas and energy for a sequel.\n\nSeries like F-Zero and Star Fox are stagnant because some combination of there not being enough of an audience and Nintendo says they need some interesting new idea to make another. So I can only surmise that the sequel to 1-2 Switch must have all kinds of interesting ideas that weren't culled from shovelware Wii games that the masses of salivating fans can really dig into. \n\nEat shit, Donkey Kong series. Kiss my ass, Kid Icarus. Mario and Luigi can burn in hell with Alpha Dream. Punch Out, you're done. Chibi Robo? Gone. Golden Sun? No way. Wario Land? Fuck off. An actual new 2D Mario game? Nobody could possibly ever want that. \n\n1-2 Switch. That's what the people want. That's where the sales are. That's what will get hardcore fans excited and casual Walmart shoppers alike. Pretending to milk a cow. 2.\n\nAre we all waiting with bated breath for Arms 2: Elbows? We're all clamoring for that big GaaS version of Metroid Prime Federation Force, right?",

Kid Icarus Uprising is rumored to get a remake made by Bandai Namco.\n\n2. Punch Out is rumoured to get a new game made by Next Level. It was kinda teased in a level from Luigi's Mansion 3 alongside Mario Strikers. That one is already on the market.\n\n3. There is no concrete information about F-Zero but it's rumoured to be some sort of remake.\n\n4. A 2D Donkey Kong game is rumoured to be in development, it's rumored to be made by the 2D Mario team.\n\nThose are the rumours that are more likely true than wrong. The rest is a tossup. Most of them will probably launch on the next gen Switch.\n\nOh and the best talent of Alpha Dream was absorbed by Monolith Soft but yeah don't expect Mario and Luigi games apart from outsourced remakes.\n\nThere are interesting discussions about the state of Nintendo game production on *Famiboards*. It can give you a lot of hints about future releases and how much resources Nintendo is investing/outsourcing. Most leaks in gaming are just smart and accurate guestimates of the information that's out there.",

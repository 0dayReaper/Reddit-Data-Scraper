Which is great, because a lot of people haven't played the original game despite it offering quite a bit of depth to the Painful and Joyful. It definitely could use an upgrade, since it essentially just plays like a Yume Nikki clone and doesn't resemble the later games that much.",

I didn't know about Lisa:the first so I assumed the details of Lisa and what happened to her would be revealed at the climax of the Painful. It was a very weird feeling to finish the game and realize the game was fully about Brad's journey (which I found somewhat interesting but not nearly as compelling). The game didn't bait and switch me. I just happened to kind of bait-and-switch myself by accident.   \n\n\nI would love it if The First got bundled into the games on Steam.",

I haven't had a chance to go through it completely but OMORI has a ton of content and some dread- I'd be weary of looking up tooooo much, but understand the different routes.  Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass is another decent one. I've never played it but Suits has been on my list. and it's been burnt to the ground by its fanbase but Undertale is a good game.",

The game really doesn't sound like my cup of tea.\n\nFromsoft games are difficult. But the game also give you all the tools you need to survive the journey right from the start. You can dodge, block, parry and use items to buff your character. It's up to you on utilizing it. And all the mistake is happening because you cause it. You actually feel like you are learning the mechanic and how the world works.\n\nRight from the start Fear and Hunger punish you for... Going in the front door. Okay maybe the game want to teach player that this is not that kind of game. The 'going loud' approach is not going to work. But then it gets more ridiculous. An enemies could cut your limbs out and unless you know specifically where to cut theirs. You are going to die. A lot. Most of the mechanic are not telling you until you literally 'die-trying' them and learning it through 'meta-gaming' perspective.\n\nYou don't figure things out right away. But through the meta-gaming perspective. Instead of learning by experience, improvise and surviving it (much like Fromsoft games do.) You need to *die*. A lot. In order to learn the rule of the world. And doing things in specific way.\n\nIt's the kind of 'die and repeat' that are fine for a rogue-like or story-maker game like Dwarf Fortress because dying is their nature. but I don't wanna see it in linear RPG. True RPG will always give you a way to learn about things directly inside the game. As the character in that world you created can learn from them. Not forcing you to die in order to learn them. \n\nGiving the credit where it's due. The game is very unique. Stylistically and mechanic wise. I always wonder about how powerful those big fantasy creature will be if they exist in our world rule. And they really go all the way in where no other games could offer. But it's also feel like one of those game that people can beat it and goes 'i'm so quirky i play harder game than Elden Ring and you don't know what hard game mean until you play this game.'  and only get away from it because it's indie. And I simply just don't wanna see this trend of 'one mistake cause your whole playthrough' style catching up.",

If done poorly a game can be made oppressively dark just to be dark. But topics also shouldn't be avoided just for being dark.\n\nArt has the potential to positively influence people, and not everyone is influenced equally by the same things. Personally, I think that darkness in media balanced well can be very meaningful.\n\nNotably, Lisa the Painful balances its darkness and tragedy with humor.. that makes it a lot easier to enjoy, even if the comedy is dark. But it's the darkness that makes it feel satisfying and honest. The characters are flawed and well written, there is goodness inside several of them hindered by personal shortcomings and insecurities.. but it doesn't mean they can't try to fight the bad within themselves.\n\nI do understand not being at a point in your life where this stuff lands well, or where it comes across as unnecessarily cruel. I also think it doesn't have to be read that way.",

It'll probably be nice but you should wait and see if the image quality tradeoffs are worthwhile.\n\nThe increase in base storage also isn't worth much given storage is cheap (*especially* now given how NAND prices have crashed). Consumer products *vastly* overcharge for storage and storage upgrades and I don't like playing into that personally.\n\nSo basically, yeah, it's mostly just back to the original price.",

Even the Index, which had been supposed to be the king of the hill, felt like a devkit rather than a consumer-ready product time to time. \n\nI just hope they didn't mess up the inter-operability (like using PCVR with Quest 3)in this generation. Knowing Meta, locking the users in their ecosystem forcibly is not the worst thing they might do (they might sell your personal data even more, somehow).",

The next highest is the Valve Index at 17% of users, and then it's a mix of other headsets below that. It's still under 2% of Steam users who even have a headset attached, but it's growing.",

Maybe you can technically do it for under $1000, but I'd be surprised if my number was that far off since from what I've seen in the past few years PC components are more expensive than ever. If I'm wrong, feel free to correct me.\n\n&gt;Other headsets pre-owned will be much cheaper.\n\nYou've completely lost me here. Oculus Quest 2 is the most popular headset ever, if anything there will be a ton more OQ2's in the pre-owned market than anything else. Why are you acting like it *is* possible to buy other headsets pre-owned, but it *isn't* possible to buy a pre-owned Quest 2?",

PCVR had a chicken-and-egg problem until the Quest 2 came out.\n\nThere's a lot to dislike about Facebook being in VR.  The Quest 2 is low powered and led to a lot of games being developed Quest-first. Facebook leaned hard into their VR social network that it's obvious no one wanted because they'd just gotten burned by Apple disabling cross-app tracking and VR was the only arena where they had device level access. And I will fault precisely no one for not wanting a Facebook-branded device covered in cameras and mics in their house.\n\nBut the simple fact is that VR being a thing that costs $1000 for the computer, then $1000 more for the headset wasn't leading anywhere.  VR costing $300 for the headset and the computer being optional saw Steam users with a VR headset of any description rise from less than 1% before the Quest 2 launched [to 1.93% today](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam), and that's not counting the people who never connected their Quest 2 to PC, or who are on Playstation.\n\nIt was going to take a big corporation willing to sell at or under cost to make VR proliferate.  Valve was interested in premium experiences, not democratized VR.  Facebook got it done.\n\nAnd it's not like they're going to be the eternal monolith.  Other big corporations aren't going to look at the Quest series and say, \"They were there first, this is their arena, and we shall not interfere.\"",

There's good reasons to question how good the hand tracking will be when the Quest 1/2 had worse tracking than the Rift before it.\n\nIt's still something to wait and see on of course, it's unlikely to be better but maybe they bridge the gap from the missing hardware well enough through other means.",

Tetris Effect VR is much different than the normal experience. \n\nIts a throwback, but VR feels like going to the arcade. The loud music. Colors. The total immersion.

But 99% of them appear to be extremely short or extremely simple games or even pretty much just proof of concept games. It's just genuinely hard to find a good, \"proper\" game like Alyx.\n\nFor instance, I found a genuinely fun and enjoyable puzzle game (The Last Clockwinder, everyone should check it out) about cloning yourself to automate tasks. It was great! Love it. But then I was done with the game after 4 hours of gameplay. And that's exactly the kind of game that could have dozens and dozens of levels and mechanics for dozens of hours of fun. But for some reason it just.. doesn't.\n\nAnd that's been my experience with so many games. Super Hot VR? Awesome. You're done in a few hours.\n\nIt just feels weird coming from PC gaming.",

There's a solid game library on the Quest 2 already but there's not a whole lot to look forward to just yet.

Vertigo Remastered was definitely closer in quality (I haven\u2019t played Vertigo 2 *yet*), but Boneworks/Lab and Budget Cuts 1 &amp; 2 both had really interesting player mechanics, but outright bad and frustrating level design that made it all obsolete.\n\nAlyx feels like it was made by experienced game developers who know how to make a good level. And yeah, it\u2019s not as exciting from a mechanics perspective, but it feels purposeful and works well with the levels they included. I\u2019d much rather take that over other VR games.",

There are many really fantastic indie games on VR, but Beat Saber is one of the only ones heavily advertised enough to sell headsets.\n\nMeanwhile, I and many others will argue that Synth Riders is the better VR rhythm game in virtually every way from song selection, core mechanics, gameplay modifiers and the overall feeling of flow. But will it ever generate anything close to Beat Saber's sales? No way, because most people, even those who have a VR headset, don't even know it exists. \n\nI'm not sure how to solve that problem necessarily, but overall I find the people who say VR has no games to play haven't played much of anything but Beat Saber or Half Life, and maybe some other very popular ones like Superhot, Population One or the Walking Dead.",

Half-Life is probably my favourite game and I bought it in early 1999. Half-Life 2 was absolutely incredible, as were the follow up episodes and Black Mesa. I have a vr headset that I got for my kids for Christmas, and I have a powerful PC. Yet I only have a very small amount of interest in playing Alyx.\n\nBeat Saber seems cool, as does Superhot, Angry Birds VR and a few other things my kids have been playing. I like putting the headset on for maybe 5 minutes and having a look, but it isn't the kind of experience I'm interested in for any longer than that. It's not that it is uncomfortable, it just isn't comparable to the experiences that are out there in traditional forms. I played Rez in vr and for me it is nowhere close to the immersion I get playing it on a tv with an Xbox 360.'",

The problem is facebook walling off software even between their own headsets.\n\nAnd this just doesn't seem like a super necessary upgrade for Quest 2 owners. \n\nI just hope I'm wrong and they will continue supporting the Quest 2, but so far that has not happened with any other previous upgrade.",

RE4 VR is one of the best VR games period and it's stuck in the quest 2 (and probably 3) ecosystem.\n\nI hope to be proven wrong, but I have low expectations. I want vr to be pushing forward.

That's what exclusives are for. Selling hardware and roping you into an ecosystem. I'm not blaming the developers. They did an excellent job with the game. It's one of my favorite vr games and because of that, I want more people to be able to play it.\n\nI'm sure the developers weren't dumbfounded as to how to run one of the most ported games of all time on a pc. It was never in the cards to begin with and I think that sucks. Again, not their fault. But someone pushed the button to not release it anywhere else but their hardware.",

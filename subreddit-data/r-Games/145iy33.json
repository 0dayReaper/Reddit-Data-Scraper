I hear 2042 is in a much better state now, but specialists, in combination with lack of persistent servers and browser server, are real dealbreakers for me. \n\nThe graphics aren't ideal, but the gameplay more than makes up for it. I'd rather have rock-solid gameplay and subpar visuals than the other way around.\n\nEDIT: I'd encourage other people who are remotely curious to check out the free playtest for the next 48 hours (as of this post).",

With the last veteran devs who gave a shit on this franchise out of the company EA thought it would be a great opportunity to finally cash in on every bad idea that was shot down by those devs through all those years and this is the result. Shallow, no heart, no atmosphere, MTX filled to the limit like it's F2P, designed from its core to sell skins, no base value, 80% less post launch content.\n\n\nJust disappointing to see a franchise you care about go down like that.",

They clearly lowered aim assist way down to accommodate playing with PC, which I didn\u2019t even want. Now everyone is way faster with sprinting and sliding, the maps are way bigger, and it\u2019s harder for me to aim.\n\nIt\u2019s just to chaotic for me. I\u2019m not condemning the game or anything I\u2019m just saying those reasons are why I\u2019m not really interested in it too much.\n\nThat plus the specialist system and the adjustments they made for 128 players made team player harder. Engineer equipment has to be less powerful to adjust for how many players will have RPGs, etc.",

Reality with any shooter is you either experience a lot of cheaters or you trust anticheat tools like FACEIT or Vanguard that heavily reduces frequency of cheating. Until technology improves in a direction that allows for effective and unintrusive anticheat, you can't have both.\n\nI don't like playing with or against cheaters and consider the risk of installing FACEIT and Vanguard worthwhile. Games that use these 'intrusive' methods of anticheat have ***far*** less cheating.",

Reality is that I'd much rather deal with a cheater once in a full moon, than, as I've said, surrender all my info with the premise that I *might* find even less cheaters. \n\nAfter all, they're fucking video games. It might be important for kids who want to make a living off of playing competitively, but I reached Legendary Eagle Master in CSGO and I don't have a single hacker/cheater story to tell.",

Graphically the game is so bad that distinguishing between square objects and people is hard enough as it is, but there's also nauseating head bob that can't be disabled. \n\n  To me it just seems like gamers are so separate for a quality battlegroundesque game that they're ready to try to make this somewhat shitty Roblox game happen. After playing for a few beta tests, there's nothing special about this game other than the fact that it was super limited time. Everything about it is mediocre, including the gunplay.",

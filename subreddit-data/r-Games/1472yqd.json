            "comment": "That's kind of rough to release a patch to the base game that increases requirements, especially for people who bought it from a store like Steam that automatically applies updates.\n\nI know there's probably not many people playing on a HDD, but you should at least be able to expect a game that you bought and played to continue being playable on the same machine.",

But TLDR, it\u2019s been almost 3 years, there\u2019s new more relevant hardware and the game has undergone plenty of changes in that time with new graphics options. \nOld stuff won\u2019t suddenly stop working, but they want new buyers to have more relevant specs to compare to for best experience.",

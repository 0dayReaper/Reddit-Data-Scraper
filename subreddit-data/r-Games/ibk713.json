There's occasional threads and comments over on hackernews, not uncommon enough that it's a fluke with people saying their app gets removed from the store for some obscure interpretation of the rules (or automated review flagged it) and getting information out of those companies on how to resolve it is hard to come by. Most of the time there's the feeling Apple/Google don't care because the scale of the store is so big, if one developer gets accidentally squished there are 1000 to fill the gap anyway unless you're a big fish.",

Part of Steve Jobs main hesitance with third party apps was quality control, and a unified App Store lets them verify everything works well, which is the main selling point of iPhones, they work well and smoothly and don't try to fuck with you. \"It just works\". \n\nOn the other hand, it's my phone, not apple's right? So why shouldn't I be able to install what I want? Perhaps they could explicitly be like \"hey this may not meet our standards but you can still install it\". \n\nI have an oculus quest and they're moving to support a third party store called SideQuest basically by describing it as an alpha testing store.",

I'm terrified every time I submit an update that it'll be removed.

They've basically stated that their hardware endeavors have peaked and their services are going to be the new drivers of growth in the future. What they want you to think, when they say that, is their middling services they recently launched (TV+, Arcade, News + etc). In reality the service growth has come from the 30% cut from the App Store. More specifically, IAP from mobile games.     \n\nYes devs can switch engines but it's not exactly a cake walk. Epic has a wide reach in the dev world.",

And in doing so punitively, it's pretty much a sign that Apple's angling to have this settled before a court case happens by making it too painful for Epic to endure long-term, because with this action against Epic, Apple is basically giving up any chance they have at winning a court case.\n\nAnd also note that while the notable parts of the Sherman Act are relevant to cases where a business has a monopoly, several parts of it -- *including the laws against restraint of trade* -- do not require the offending company to be in a monopoly position.   It is illegal to unreasonably prevent a company from doing business with another company as a condition of a contract, regardless of whether you're a monopoly or not.\n\nPlenty of people like to argue that Apple's not a monopoly because Android exists.  That's *completely irrelevant* to this offense (and, less clearly so, to Epic's original complaint).\n\nYou can expect Epic to respond to this with an immediate motion to enjoin Apple from terminating their developer account while the lawsuit is in progress due to the irreparable harm it would cause them.",

Apple has abused it's monopoly by forcing all companies on the app store to use it's In-App purchasing service which costs 30%.

Allow competition in the in-app purchasing market ( allow other services like PayPal or epics purchasing service ), or\n2.  break the monopoly on application distribution by allowing market competition.

When you become large enough sometimes people don't have another choice but to use your products for business/personal use. When this happens, being able to dictate who can use and do what on your service can be enormously oppressive. \n\nThink about how a tree is an ecosystem that a ton of animals and insects use to survive. If the tree suddenly rejects the rights of something to live on it they are essentially killing it. But without that animal it can cause extreme damage to the ecosystem or create an environment that is unhealthy for everyone, including the tree itself. \n\nAn operating system is a lot like the tree. By disallowing competitors to use your service you can control the market itself. Companies shouldn't have the unilateral ability to decide which other companies can do business. It's unhealthy for consumers and competitors. Eventually it will have an affect on Apple itself, but they have so far skirted responsibility. \n\nApple only cares about itself and has operated an extremely toxic environment for a long time, and it's surprising how they have managed to keep up such positive PR. \n\nI could go on and on about examples like what Apple is doing. Another example is Reddit and their ability to dictate what content they allow on their website, all while justifying it via \"private servers.\" Remember when they were blocking posts about the HK/China protests? \n\nOr companies like Facebook and Twitter who eat up political advertising revenue and often attempt to use their reach to influence elections. \n\nMany, many reasons this is bad and unhealthy for everyone. When a company becomes as large and influential as those that I've mentioned, they have an ethical responsibility towards society and not themselves and their shareholders. And when their actions serve only themselves or their benefactors they need to be held accountable for those actions.",

The hearings were more a public airing of grievances that had very little to do with actual anti-trust litigation.

It was mostly theater for the public.",

Of course. \n\nDo I think Apple has overstepped their boundaries as an app producer, doing things such as making their Apple products as close-ended as they can and stopping release of any apps such as xCloud that could interfere with their own services, while also charging exorbitant amounts of money for their products? Of course. \n\nThis isn\u2019t like politics. These are two companies having a slap fight over customer\u2019s money. In an ideal world, they\u2019d both die and we\u2019d feast on their remains.

But to have a corporate propaganda film spun up and ready to try and wage a public relations war with 9 year olds against Apple is just absolutely bonkers. As someone who can see the big picture and realize just the silliness of it , its entertaining as hell, but I wonder if Epic's efforts are making any sort of dent in society.",

Epic only has a certain % of their business tied to Apple, and while lawsuits can be expensive it's not necessarily a cost that Apple can increase for Epic past a point (unless Apple wins in a way that requires epic to pay their fees)",

That seems to be against the rules on the iOS app store and Fortnite was removed from the store. Epic then immediately came out with a lawsuit and a marketing video riling up people to fight against Apple. Now the two seem to be trading punches left and right and we don't really know where it will end up.\n\nWhole bunch of speculation on who's right, what's legal or not, if this makes it better or worse for one side or the other. Also some theories more on the \"out there\" side of things about Tencent and the ongoing TikTok/WeChat situation in the US. In the end, we don't know shit. \n\nI feel like both sides have their merits and their stupidities, but I don't know shit about the laws behind this, precedents or anything so I don't really have a horse in this race. Only thing I have an opinion on is on how quickly Epic came out with the ad and the lawsuit as if this whole thing was planned which seems kinda weird, plus trying to make the kids playing Fortnite their private army to win on the public opinion front is scummy.",

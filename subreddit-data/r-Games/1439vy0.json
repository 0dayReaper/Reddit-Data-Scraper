I saw some gameplay with music, and it feels just sooo wrong. I recall the bonus stages on the desert world where you need to outrun a ghost in a dark area and that shit was SO SPOOKY, especially because after collecting everything on an already hard stage, you had one chance only for the bonus stage (because if the ghost collects the key it does not respawn even after you die). It was peak stress in my childwood.",

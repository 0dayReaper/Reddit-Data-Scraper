But I immediately thought that this would be way way better in VR. \n\nGlad to see it coming to VR eventually.",

They are great games to listen to a podcast or watch a tv-show while playing. \n\nWell, you can still of course listening to your podcast while playing the VR version of the game. Fuck, I would say that even watching something can actually be a better experience while doing so, at least if you have a typically sized 24 to 27\" monitor and need to share that space between your video player and the game's window which should be at a certain minimum size to play the game. In VR you can just size your video frame (all PC VR headsets as well as the Quest platform support pinning background apps like your browser windows or a streaming service app into your VR view), on top of just turning around and getting closer to a video frame placed in world space (like a wall rendered in your game). Although I would of course not watch a serious TV show or movie that way, but neither would I in a split view frame on my TV while playing something as loud as PowerWash Sim. \n\n\n\nYou can likely still play this sitting down in VR, but even the prefered way of really standing in your 360 degree space mostly consists of standing in your room, turning around and maybe walk a few steps or crouch. Its not as super involved considering you are basically using a super low weight wireless hoe to do your cleaning. \n\n&gt; But in VR power wash simulator is just called having a job lol.\n\n&gt; I could just do this in real life and get paid real money.\n\nBy the same logic you could also something productive on your PC while listening to a podcast to make money... And this is ignoring that you can't just find a job power washing something but only work when you feel like it and from the comfort of your home.\n\nSpeaking of which, most people likely have no opportunity to just power wash something for fun do to not having the space or any motivation to clean up afterwards, let alone not being able to work with some outlandish objects like a monster truck or something.",

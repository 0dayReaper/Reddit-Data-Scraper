Far moreso than any usual FF recurring names/concepts.

Almost all your skills can be executed by hotkey from a skill bar or performed with button combos like a fighting game (though some are hot key only). The majority of these skills have cooldowns, but can be used off cooldown for slightly less powerful versions that might deal less damage or lack certain proc effects. It makes combat flow beautifully, but the biggest issue with it in BDO is that all the enemies you're using these amazing combos on are brainless zerg hordes that offer no counterplay and just end up getting chain cc'ed or juggled to death since you need to kill 50,000 of them for it to mean anything.",

                            "comment": "Agreed. It's an uncreative way to balance abilities and an unnecessary limit on combat creativity. It's definitely a big reason why I don't like God of War's new combat.\n\nSomeone mentioned a mana meter being a lame alternative because the combat becomes \"just spam best ability\" which would just scream incompetence at combat design (which clearly isn't the case here). \n\nThe Tales series uses a mana sans cooldown system and last I checked, their combat is nearly universally praised.\nYs does something similar.\nLoZ, Bloodborne, FromSoft's other titles, Star Wars FO/JS, DMC, and so on.\n\nWith the exception of non-Bloodborne FromSoft games (where magic is notoriously powerful if you specifically build for it), there's a very clear and common balancing mechanic. The secondary resource that provides cool effects, big damage, and flashy choreography is more available the better the player is at everything else -- which is the biggest point of the whole topic. If you're good at dishing out combos or parrying and dodging enemy attacks, you're rewarded with the ability to unleash the crazier parts of your tools. The combat cycle rewards itself and encourages the player to be better on all fronts.\n\nA basic cooldown design can be exactly like the other person claimed: sit back and spam your big stuff until it dies, except instead of being limited by mana, you're limited by time. If one strat proves so effective you just want to bide your time until it becomes available, the combat can devolve into extremely defensive styles.\n\nAgain, that's only if the cooldown design is very basic. Even the slight adjustment like landing hits or dodging can reward you by lowering CDs can make a big difference.\n\nSo yeah. Cooldowns can be lame in this type of game, agreed. I'm not terribly surprised you're being downvoted for a very common balancing mechanic, but it sucks to see.",

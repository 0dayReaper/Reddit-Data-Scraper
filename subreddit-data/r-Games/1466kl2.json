Even less, if it's a shitty survival game instead of an adventure game.\n\nThe guy was pretty much responsible for everything in the first few games. From story, to character design, puzzles or music.\n\nOn top of that, the original triology concluded the series anyway. Might have been a controverse ending, but it was pretty clear going by Doomsday, that there was never an intention of continuing it (and has been stated as such by Poki multiple times).",

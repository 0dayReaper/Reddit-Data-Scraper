            "comment": "I think in this post-E3 world everybody is still trying to figure out how to do E3 without E3, without a studio audience, without big stage shows, etc.\n\nPersonally, I was kind of bored with the presentations that were nothing but trailer after trailer after trailer. That was just so incredibly boring. So even if any of the games turn out to be really interesting, I didn\u2019t get a sense of that from most of presentations we got because they were mediocre trailers sandwiched in between 30 other mediocre trailers. I guess this year I found that most of the trailers just plain suck, regardless of the quality of the actual game.\n\nI would\u2019ve much preferred if more of the games had a legitimate showcase, the way Bethesda and Ubisoft and a few others did it this year. It\u2019s crazy to me that only such a small handful of the publishers/developers chose to promote their games like that this year.\n\nThis is the part they all need to learn fro next year and beyond, because even if E3 is not coming back, you still need to do more to promote the game than just putting out a 90-second trailer. Have somebody come out and actually introduce the game and talk about it, those are the moments people remember.",

These showcases are done during the week when I'm busy and I won't have the energy to watch them when I get home from work.  So brief and to the point is preferred. I think it would be good to have a separate day that goes more in depth to some titles which is what Xbox seems to be doing with it's extended showcase.\n\nThough for me I'm still not going to check extended unless we get more gameplay.  Since anything that's discussed info wise I can just read up on later.  Which is the format I prefer.",

The trailer/gameplay snippet style is how it's going to be for 99% of the games and then the 1% is the \"console sellers\" that will get the in depth look. Then on another day they will go slightly more in depth on the lesser titles.",

Of course not. But if their presentation is effective and compelling enough, certainly MORE people will watch that than a bland trailer, and certainly more people would then consider buying that game.\n\nNobody is saying that everyone needs to put out a feature-length documentary like what Bethesda did. That shit was crazy, although it also was necessary because Starfield is such a huge game in terms of scope. But for smaller games, surely a couple of minutes DEMOING it would be so much more effective than some shitty 90-second trailer.\n\nGames, even the small-budget ones, take years to make. If you can\u2019t sum up the reason why you are spending years on a game into a 5 minute presentation/demo, then you as a game developer have fucked up.\n\nShow us the game, spend a few minutes promoting and demoing what you\u2019re making (it doesn\u2019t need to be half an hour long), and if it\u2019s compelling enough, people WILL watch it. Certainly more people than would watch a bland, boring-ass \u201ctrailer\u201d.",

They have no marketing  budget, unless you're following the Twitter page for a specific indie game you would never even hear they're holding a conference, those smaller studios are very fortunate to have Microsoft completely eat the marketing bill for this. \n\nI have to firmly disagree that a showcase with less trailers and more people talking and trying to be entertaining would be better than what we got, it's fine if that's your preference I just think it's a wild take. Bethesda gets all that time to show off Starfield because they are a massively successful developer and the marketing will pay off.",

If someone clicks on the link and sees it's 20 minutes long they are going to close it immediately. If it's 2 minutes long, they'll watch.\n\n&gt;surely a couple of minutes DEMOING it would be so much more effective than some shitty 90-second trailer.\n\nAgain, it would not. Most people don't actually like watching someone else play games. The trailers are designed to get people interested without overstaying their welcome and are paced to keep attention for the whole 90 seconds.",

And there are extra interviews and details from other outlets, plus hands on events at the in person behind closed doors SGF event. I know some of that behind closed doors stuff is embargoed until later in the week, too.\n\nI think if you compare just the big showcase to all of E3, you will be massively disappointed. But there other stuff is there, just maybe not as concentrated as it once was",

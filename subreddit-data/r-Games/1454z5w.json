Time and time again, the quality of their big games from a pure gameplay and fun standpoint are just off the charts.   To take something so underpowered like the switch, and just make hit after hit.. it really is so impressive that they've been able to do this so consistently for so many years.  They have huge hardware flops sometimes, like the Wii U (which I truly feel had a LOT to do with the fact that they called it the Wii U) but the games are just constantly SO GOOD.",

It's maybe once every two or three years that Nintendo release a huge new game. Most of their games that sell are old. PlayStation has multiple new big exclusives every year, and since their console has better hardware it's the best place (on console) for third party titles as well. Pretty sure PS5 hardware was up 80% YoY.",

Nintendo new releases has one the best selling games, if not best selling games released YEARLY, so I don't what you're talking about only old games selling. If meant reviews, Nintendo pretty much as always has one best reviewed games yearly like PS, with way bigger genre variety too. And YoY doesnt really mean anything, since we have yet to see how long PS5 tail will be, but Switch has easily passed the PS4.",

You have to be assuming the majority of all Nintendo fans are old enough to feel nostalgic about Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, etc.\n\nMy first Zelda game was Skyward Sword, some other 14 year old's first Zelda could've been Breath of the Wild. You can't chalk it up to nostalgia because Nintendo makes games that appeal to newer generations of kids *and* adults.\n\nThe reason they succeed is due to wide appeal across all age ranges, it is not because of nostalgia. Also, how is continuing to update your tried and true game franchises a bad thing? Every single developer and publisher would, and many have tried and failed, looking at Microsoft and Halo.",

But Halo fell off, Gears of War fell off, Banjo Kazooie fell off (when Microsoft owned it). Sony has series that didn't quite fall off but clearly peaked a long time ago like Ratchet and Clank, Tomb Raider, and even Final Fantasy. I would say God of War is the ONE Sony franchise that is at Nintendo-levels of longevity and quality. With Nintendo, it's pretty much everything they touch - Zelda, Metroid, Animal Crossing, Xenoblade, Smash Bros., and Fire Emblem are in extremely strong positions right now, arguably their all-time peaks for a few of them. Nintendo is just better at making games. That's why they even have access to nostalgia.",

If there's 10, 9 of them sell over a million copies and at least one of them sells 20 million. The difference is that the rest of them aren't budgeted in a way that they all have to sell 10 million copies to make a tidy profit like Sony's do.\n\nThird party titles that launch on Switch and Playstation at the same time sell better on Switch across the board.

The Switch V2/OLED are running on a updated version of the X1 Mariko chip so they do perform slightly better than a launch Switch. \n\nBut I still don't think that's worth the price tag unless you're going to be taking advantage of the OLED and battery life. \n\nI think we're in a great place now for portable gaming with stuff like the Steam Deck and ASUS Rog Ally showing what they can do. I hope this positions Nintendo to make something in the middle with more power, but keeping their thinner form factor.",

Of course, the argument that follows is graphical fidelty or keeping par with the rest of the industry, all things Nintendo historically doesn't give a shit about, or that the sales are still going up so why would they stop, with the implication that the Wii U and Wii (and breaking into other companies the PS2 and PS3) also didn't follow this exact same trend... it's all just a mess. \n\nThe power of a system is the biggest reason why new ones get made in the first place. Power of the system's dulling, the people who're best at optimizing it (Monolith Soft and Nintendo themselves) have basically no more super huge projects, and a theoretical Switch 2 or brand new console is pretty clearly on the table by now as a result.  Pretty much the only actual conversation that could come is \"will it have backwards compatibility or not\" or \"how will they keep the mobile/home-use appeal\" really.",

The CEO stated early last year in no uncertain terms that the Switch is only at 50% of its life cycle. While this could just be an incredibly optimistic projection, we have already seen evidence that the Switch has had unprecedented sales for a system that's 6 years into it's life, and has yet to have an actual official price cut. For comparison, by this point of the PS4's life. It had price cuts, major sales declines and Sony had already announced the existence of the PS5 a full year prior. Meanwhile the Switch is still selling strong at full MSRP and just released what could potentially be the highest selling game of the year with TotK whereas information on the Switch 2 is still nothing more than a scattered mess of barely coherent rumors. \n\nSo while there's a chance that Nintendo could be gearing up for their next big console. There's an equal possibility they have further plans and could randomly announce a Mario Odyssey 2 + Price Cut Bundle out of nowhere to further stimulate Switch sales for an extra year or 2 longer.. What then? \n\nMoral of the story: Don't base your console purchase decisions on \"What ifs\". Base your decision simply on what we know NOW and if the current existing console and it's current existing games interest you or not. \n\nNintendo has a relentless history of completely contradicting people's expectations. Just ask the fellows who, 3 years later, are still waiting for the fabled \"Switch Pro\" and have essentially missed an entire console generation due to dangling an imaginary carrot in front of their own heads. \n\nI'm not saying go out and buy a Switch now. But, don't sell yourself on a \"what if\" console that Nintendo has never promised you in the next year. You could be in for a much longer wait than you think.",

If I remember correctly, in the months/years prior to its announcement Nintendo had teased a more \"mature\" Zelda with art more along the lines of Twilight Princess graphics (\"high fidelity\" with more muted colors) so people were expecting something like this. Wind Waker was the exact opposite.\n\nI wasn't thrilled by its style either when it was first announced (and I can see people not liking it even if I do - its very distinct) and yet it was one of my favorites when playing it back then and to this day. I just wish the remaster didn't remove stuff like the Tingle tuner (why?!? you already had 2 screens...) which was fun but not easy to access back then or at least not locked to the biggest failure nintendo has produced...",

Those gamers that complained were probably Gen Yers who got their start on Super Nintendo and by the time GC/Wii came around, they were in their mid teens/early adult years and they were looking for more \u201cmature\u201d games so that they weren\u2019t seen as playing kids stuff because bullying was still huge on that. \n\nMeanwhile, Gen Z, who grew up on the GC/Wii era, never really left it behind because the internet never phased the \u201ckids stuff\u201d out like with Gen Y.  By the time they were adults, there was huge adult fandom for previous kids stuff and bullying for watching anime and cartoons was much less than with Gen Y. So people weren\u2019t ashamed of liking those things because it was now mainstream in things like the MCU.",

Even adding SSHD (around 5m) doesn't really change the fact that Pok\u00e9mon sells 2x Zelda.",

You\u2019re dropped on a random island, naked, with no weapons, and have to figure out both how to get off the island and also how to not die. The enemies are really difficult for a beginning player, and in this new one, you even have to figure out how to build things to take you farther. I\u2019d argue it doesn\u2019t become pick up and play until after that.",

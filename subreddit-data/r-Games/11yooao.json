Now, the engine instead stores the actual timestamp of the event and calculates effects based on that. This means that the resolution of time is much, much higher than before, because timestamps can be stored with very high precision without it costing more CPU power.",

A timing error of half a millisecond in either direction is enough to cause the ball to miss the strike zone.\n\n&gt; To put that in perspective, it takes about five milliseconds for the fastest nerve impulse to travel the length of the arm. That means that when your arm is still rotating toward the correct position, the signal to release the ball is already at your wrist. \n\n&gt; In terms of timing, this is like a drummer dropping a drumstick from the tenth story and hitting a drum on the ground on the correct beat.\n\nWe're really, REALLY, ***REALLY*** good at training precise timing.",

A higher tick rate meant the game felt more responsive.\n\nFor example, let's say a game has a tick rate of 60. This means, every second, the server polls for actions 60 times. If you click to pull the trigger, the game server won't register it until the next tick. This could be as soon as a single millisecond, or an entire 1/60th of a second. \n\nThis is how in some games, two people can shoot each other and kill each other at the same time. One person might have clicked sooner by a few milliseconds, but because of the tick rate, the server only registered the shot at the same tick, so as far as the server is concerned, the players shot each other at the exact same time, killing each other at the exact same time. Even though in reality, one player might have pulled the trigger faster than the other.\n\nThis is why some people complain about games having low tick rates. It makes the game feel less responsive. \n\nAnd CS2 having the server record everything in real time instead of using ticks is a huge positive change from every other major game in the shooter genre as a result.",

What CS used was who joined the server first to determine the winner on same tick mutual kills. this is a much better system.",

If anything happens in between the claps the game never knows it happens or skews into happening too late. \n\nPreviously the community would double the amounts of ticks/\"claps\" - to make it happen less often (64 to 128). \n\nValve said fuck it, created a system that doesn't rely on the ticks/\"claps\" to update with, instead it's more \"just-in-time\" feedback to the server. (of course ticks still happen but the timing isn't the only deciding factor anymore.)\n\nThis is much easier said than done and will require more from hardware and data transfers. Remember that the foundation of all online fps games even today rely on techniques developed in the mid to late 90's - specifically Quake.\n\nThe gaming industry has no real financial incentive to create good networking condition - vocal minority might delude you so we haven't really seen major innovations in regards to accurate and reliable feedback when playing online. Just more players and shit happening with less accurecy.",

I assume that this is a step above what Q2 did, but, essentially Q2 allowed the server to react immediately to movement commands (and even firing commands) on the sub-frame they are received on (since the server receives client movement packets as fast as they can), and since Q2's server tickrate was 10hz it was very important to making weapons \"appear\" instantaneous. The feedback of the weapon firing wasn't visible to the client until the server frame arrived, though.\n\nQuake 3 and Quake Live had client prediction for weaponry, so the clients felt like their weapons were acting immediately (and missiles would even simulate enough movement so that they synced up on both ends).",

I've never, ever bought into the idea that 4:3 gives you any objective advantage.\n\nThe decision to play in 4:3 came first because old school pros didn't want to change their setups, then the justifications came after. It's essentially an aesthetic choice to indicate to other people that you're a serious player, which strikes me as odd because there's video proof it has caused pros to get shot by people they would've been able to see in 16:9. To each their own I guess?",

Not only will you keep every item you\u2019ve collected over the years, but they\u2019ll all benefit from Source 2 lighting and materials.\n\nIt's free, and skins will be ported. But I wonder if CSGO itself will be archived as an old branch, or be archived as a separate application altogether.\n\nIf they plan to have the skins work from CSGO to CS2, it's probably the former. If CSGO remains playable, I wonder if they can just somehow have both games' skin drops be shared. Since they're actual items in your Steam inventory, I don't see why that can't be the case.",

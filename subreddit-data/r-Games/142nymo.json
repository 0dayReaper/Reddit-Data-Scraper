With I think the only big one remaining being NPC enemies?  I think?\n\nAfter that, you would then say the game is in Beta where all the features are nailed down, and you're primarily doing bug fixes / balance changes.  But with the, what, decade long development, I imagine they'd just skip that particular naming scheme and do a 1.0 launch after any Alpha 2x.x bug fix patches happen.\n\nBut, I mean, aside from the \"well akshually\" meaning of Alpha, yeah, this has not been a typical development cycle.  Hell the game was launched on consoles in 2016!  So it kinda already went gold there... \n\nMaybe I should just say \"I can't wait for the game to be feature-complete.\"\n\nBecause that's currently when I plan my next playthru lol.",

That's just the state of industry. \n\nTake GTA for example. That game went \"gold\" in 2013, it's a completely different game today. Or another good example is No Man's Sky. \n\nThat was my only point. That they could just call what they have now \"gold\" and continue releasing updates. The label is arbitrary.",

Since the advent of game updates, all sorts of things have just become mutable as seen fit.\n\nThough... \"*technically\"*... features changing and evolving during an alpha... OK I'm going to stop because I'm not proving anything lol.  TFP have just been working on 7Days and that's that.\n\nHowever, there's one thing I'm really curious about: once they do get those last bits of the roadmap into the game and hit a 1.0, non-alpha launch, will they finally move on to something new?  Or will they continue just building 1.x feature patches as they've done alpha builds, and ultimately nothing changes?  If that happens, then I will declare you the winner of this conversation.  Will either of us remember this discourse all those years in the future when this does/doesn't happen?  Probably not!",

Are they still releasing updates?\n\nAlpha, beta, Gold - none of those labels matter really anymore.",

Don't buy it.\"  \n\n\nI should have expanded on my point, it's not that it's in alpha that I recommend against this game. It's that I didn't find it fun. I bought it however many years ago when it was in a very basic state, decided to wait until it was more fleshed out. Tried again last year, rubber banded into a group of zombies multiple times. Found the world still empty and boring. From all the online discussion I've ever seen about the game, the developers focus on re-inventing existing systems instead of adding to them.   \n\n\nI wouldn't pay more than $5 for this game, and that's only if you're desperate to give it a go.",

Because If he's guilty he's like Wagner. Made beautiful music that still is emotive even now but is a monster \n\nAnd if he didn't do it his life is destroyed \n\nThe Skyrim music still holds up today. The night ambient theme you could listen to for hours \n\nAs regards the music in this game I know they're having the fallout 4 music designer do this, inon zur. And yeah everything seems one note oh wonder how cool is space music. Nice the first time but can act like the opposite if it kicks in even when non glorious things are happening\n\nAnd then generic action schlock combat music",

W3 has a mostly static open world and didn't really make any expectations otherwise. It's wholly focused on story missions and hunts, and Geralt just kind breezes by everything else. Good window dressing, but you're never obligated to spend much time looking at it. The scope is just about right for the amount of unique content you have.\n\nCyberpunk *tries* to have a Bethesda style open world and that's where most of the problems emerged. The bad police system, the uninspired gear and car mechanics, the repetitive gig jobs, etc. were all distractions from Cyberpunk's (pretty good) story content and a gigantic bug farm in terms of constantly breaking immersion. If it had had a more condensed world with less *stuff* in between, I think people would've been more receptive to its good parts.",

The main story should just be something we can do at our own pace when we feel like it's time to move things forward.\n\nOh, and they definitely teased powers towards the end of that video.",

I'm just hoping that the story won't be about a galaxy ending threat because I feel like that kind of story doesn't go well with an open world game like this. It's the only criticism I really had about Mass Effect 3. You have a war going on and you're off doing side quests that don't connect to the main story. The game tried to act like it was really urgent when it really wasn't. \n\nI just don't want this to have that same kind of clash. I don't wanna be told by NPC's how urgent it is for me to each my next main story destination, only for it to then not matter if I decide to fuck around exploring. If it is that kind of story or if there are missions like that then I want there to be consequences if I choose to do side missions instead. \n\nMaybe a main mission requires me to answer a distress call at a research station. If I go straight away I can save everyone, if I wait an hour then everyone is dead and the base is overrun by enemies. \n\nI want my choices to actually matter, not just from a story standpoint but from a gameplay standpoint too.",

I'm a Sony/Nintendo gamer, so maybe this is just me wanting what I cant have, but as soon as they showed off the ship and crew customization I was sold. Its like what No Man's Sky was supposed to  be at launch. It has all the things I've always wanted in a new Mass Effect game (ship piloting, combat, and customization, more elaborate crew mechanics, more elaborate backstory/personality mechanics, etc).\n\nIt feels like the only essential space fantasy concept missing from this trailer are sentient aliens, but even that might be in there somewhere, given the premise.\n\nThat said, the only Bethesda game I've really played is Skyrim on Xbox 360, so maybe I just dont have enough healthy skepticism when it comes to Todd Howard projects lol\n\n**Edit:** also this is all coming directly after a really underwhelming Sony showcase, so maybe thats creating some bias in me. I still can't believe we didnt get any Naughty Dog trailers at that showcase.",

What he means is that there aren't sentient aliens like we know, but there are alien creatures on other planets that are on an intellectual level of our wild animals, which is probably the kinds of life forms we'd see when we explore the galaxy. Finding another sentient and spacefaring civilization wouldn't probably happen at the very beginning of spacefaring, which is the period of the future where Starfield is set.",

I hated how much focus Fallout 4 had on player created settlements and radiant quests, since it only had 2 real towns and very few hand crafted quests compared to a typical Bethesda game. I don't think I have played a Bethesda game as little as I have Fallout 4. Starfield also has base building and generated content, but seeing all the hand crafted cities and how they talk about the story makes me feel better about it. It looks like I can just ignore the No Mans Sky stuff and play it as a classic Bethesda RPG.\n\nIs the 5 day early access also for Game Pass?",

A thousand planets! They're really making it seem like it's not just mostly empty space.\n\nIn fact a lot of what they showed seems like a LOT and frankly if this game isn't a buggy mess and they pull off what they claim it's going to be the best RPG ever!\n\nLike the amount of customizations, the size of the world, the combat, and just what they claim you can do is frankly insane!",

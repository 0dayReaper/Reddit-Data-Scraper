There was also [a write-up on the MK subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/rrh6fp/no_the_ptsd_story_isnt_real/) talking about how it probably isn't real. It'd be pretty fucked for a writer to make up a story about a developer but embellishment is commonplace. I don't know if we'll ever get a definitive answer because it looks like there's been very little follow-up on the claim or on working conditions since then.",

Same with the X-ray moves and their derivatives becoming core parts of the gameplay.\n\nthere are so many downsides. \n\n* it obviously turns away a huge audience that just wants a fun goofy fighting game (the gameplay is otherwise solid and easy to pick up) \n\n* so much time and effort is put into them that presumably take away from time spent working on other things, instead spent accurately modelling essentially full-body permutations of every character down to their musculature and bones, animating them, rigging things like the gibs, developing the tech behind swapping the models on the fly, et cetera\n\n* even if that article about the anonymous mk staff member that developed ptsd is false (it seems more likely that mk fans just dont undersrand why anonymity is important), it's still a fact that the animation and art teams presumably do have to look up this kind of stuff to be able to model and render it like they do, and i can vouch that that stuff can fuck you up. speaking from experience, i had to watch an actual taped suicide for my work training, and to say it had a profound impact on me mentally is an understatement.\n\n* a more subjective point, but the focus on brutality and...anatomical accuracy(?) over character and flair makes it hard to enjoy them from an artistic pov - compare the fatalities to the Instant Kill animations from Guilty Gear Xrd, and it's night-and-day, how much more character, charm, and creativity went into those cutscenes, vs. Jax kicks your head like a football and football noises play. Haha, johnny cage is using you like a puppet after bisecting you. Mileena eats your face cause she has a fucked up mouth.\n\n* probably the most damning point - they're so violent that content creators can't use footage or they'll get demonetized. The issues with Algorithms demonetizing videos is its own discussion, but frankly, i'm not surprised that the stuff is removed.\n\n* the point people always bring up of \"it's gotten more cartoonish\" has never made sense to me. Putting aside what i said about the 2d and early 2000 games having goofy fatalities due to the tech or the time, the problem isn't whether the blood is flowing realistically, or how easy it is for Kitana to rip your torso off of your legs. The problem is the anatomical rendering, the care and effort put into the brutality and gore.\n* the previous point gets even worse now that they're shifting away from the grimdark setting to a more charming, appealing world, with charactwrs they're clearly trying to develop beyond \"Former queen\" or \"Hollywood Star Goofball\".\n\n it was already getting weird when they added (thankfully adult) offspring of main charavters in MKX, and you could have johny cage brutally murder his daughter, but it was somewhat excuseable because its artstyle and worldbuilding catered to that kind of inteseness.\n\n Now this beautiful and lush setting, with easily the best character designs they've ever done, are being contrasted with the mandatory \"don't worry, youre still gonna be able to see EVERY VEIN pop in slow motion when your favorite character's head gets blown up\" cutscenes in even the trailers. It's like if fullmetal alchemist had death scenes based off of Friday the 13th. \n\nIf the game has a no-violence toggle, like how in Street Fighter 6 you can turn off visual character damage in the options menu, i may pick it up. Fuck, show me a goofy babality or friendship whenever i'd normally see my character get gibbed. i think those are way more charming and umique anyways, and i dont have to worry about my twitch stream getting flagged because i didnt cut to something else during an x-ray. \n\nThe problem isnt the realism - i can just think about that work training clip, seeing that person's eyes and muscles twitching afterwards, or the disquieting rhythm of the blood dripping out of their head, if i want \"realistic\" pain or death. it's just how prevalent the gore is, and how much love, care, and effort they put into it. Less \"think of the kids!\", more \"priorities are out of whack\".",

That said, the animation style ***is*** a major identifier of this series, at least from an outside perspective.\n\nSimilarly, I cant help but feel like most people complaining in this sub don't play modern MK games, and the animation style is why.",

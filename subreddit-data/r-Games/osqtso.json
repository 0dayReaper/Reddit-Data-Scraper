Maybe it'd be less necessary with unions that lay out reasonable steady raises. Seems kind of like a chicken and the egg thing - would be hard to break the cycle though.",

Unions don't just protect good employees. They also protect shit ones. So joining a union has the prospect of: 1) Reducing my pay, through a combination of union dues + group bargaining effectively reducing my individual bargaining power 2) Keeping my bosses (or hell, me) from being able to fire an argumentative cargo-cult programmer who's existence only creates additional work for me.\n\nIt's just not a good deal. It probably never will be a good deal. A union that programmers would be interested in would end up looking a lot like a medieval Guild, which probably also isn't a good thing.",

This is why unions inevitably turn to policies that favor existing members at the expense of future ones.\n\nEveryone thinks they're a top performer until they find out otherwise. Anyone who has been in a management position can tell you that all the worst performers are convinced they're integral and irreplaceable.",

Most people lack merit.\n\n2) Except you, you're way better. You're awesome. You deserve better. You have merit.\n\nThat's not really been my experience of work for the last 20+ years. I'm someone who does well and gets promoted a fair but I don't think I'm actually necessarily better than others, and I'm definitely not putting more effort in - I'm just kind of naturally well-suited to stuff (oh and being a tall straight white guy with a deep voice and a positive manner is probably not hurting me hmmmm).\n\nIt's also very clear, having worked in tech (thankfully no longer), that merit is not the same thing as being suitable for management roles. And this is clearly an issue in game dev. People who are hard-working and skilled are often promoted into management, but have no management skills, and little interest in management, and they accept it because it's the only way to get more money.\n\nSo everyone gets fucked. They stop doing what they're good at. The people below them get someone who doesn't want to be a manager and doesn't have the temperament to be a manager.\n\nWhereas if you just paid people more to stay doing what they were good at... you'd have more people doing jobs they're good at. But I guess that's unacceptable.",

There are always more people at the bottom of the ladder than there are at the top. This is inherent to office jobs. It's literally pointless to all rise the ladder, there aren't enough jobs at the top. \n\nRising the ladder doesn't have much in common with skill. It's much more about interpersonal relationships.\n\nRising the ladder doesn't go away if there are unions. The main point is that you don't HAVE to rise the few ladders corporations like to have to receive fair compensation. \n\nIn a good corporate environments, there are many ladders you can climb. One involving skill, one involving people, one involving vision, one involving overview etc.\n\nYou don't necessarily need unions to achieve this but it's a lot more common in those that do.\n\nPeople forget that unions are literally there to fight on behalf of all. A bad union overstays it's welcome by introducing gatekeeping and deadend positions for the sake of a paycheck. A good union creates benefits for those that don't WANT to climb the ladder but are nonentheless good people.\n\nI'd love to go into more detail but i'd pike to ask a question first.

This is inherent to office jobs. It's literally pointless to all rise the ladder, there aren't enough jobs at the top.\n\nThis is america, it's all about individualism. Most don't care (or can't care) about making sure everyone climbs to the top, they care about their ability to. And that's something one has a lot of control over, so they can praise or blame their progress on themself.\n\nAnd yes, it's not a meritocracy necessarily. Peopel who want to climb with play the game and talk the talk. They are fine if that means a big payoff.\n\n&gt;A bad union overstays it's welcome by introducing gatekeeping and deadend positions for the sake of a paycheck. A good union creates benefits for those that don't WANT to climb the ladder but are nonentheless good people.\n\nand there's the problem. A union is usually made by people who want to climb the ladder. if people don't want to climb, why would they take the time out of their busy life to try and make a union? \n\nMany people are concenred with *where* a union is, but not on the details of *who* makes the union.",

Tier 1 help desk are invaluable and most helpdesks I've seen and helped managed have the lowest tier as T1/T2 after new hires get experience.

You need people who can understand customer problems and *solve them* because they've seen problems like them a hundred times.\n\nIt's only when companies treat them like unskilled labor and mandate scripts and the like do you end up with people who can't actually help you.

Looking at SE jobs in Stockholm, you're looking at $80,000 for a principal software engineer. The comparable salary in Nashville is $140,000 for not even the highest paying job market. Entry level SEs are making $10,000 more than principals in Stockholm. The tech industry is also throwing out benefits like candy.\n\nLike there's nothing written into the union contracts that limit pay, but at least looking at pay comparisons it's at least not hard to understand why people would be hesitant to change their situation.",

Once it goes to court, it's over though. I would love to see internal communication about this exposed. I doubt it will happen though. Too much damage to the stock and thus Activision is probably willing to settle for a substantial amount.",

Fully taking advantage of our time and putting unrealistic expectations on us to the point where one of my co workers got in trouble for going to the bathroom too much and was asked to bring in a doctor\u2019s note. Our new supervisors would openly talk about their sexual exploits in great detail too. \n\nMy boss from the old bank, (who was brought on to be a co manager), went from being super cool and understanding to being a complete dick while toeing the new company line. He mostly did that behind our backs so he still acted like our friend until things didn\u2019t go his way. One time, the AC was broken and everyone in the office kept getting each other sick. He pretty much accused us all of faking getting sick. Later that week, he was having a conversation with another manager next to my desk and I overheard him say, \u201cif they don\u2019t like it here, they can leave, but good luck finding another job\u201d. \n\nA week later I no showed and never came back. I decided a few months of hardship was worth my self respect. Pretty sure I got blacklisted from a few places I applied at too since the banking community was smaller than I realized. But I was better off for it in the long run. \n\nTL;DR: Fuck these companies.

My coworker who stayed at the bank after I left got massive retaliation after reporting some of our complaints to HR. Another lesson in na\u00efvet\u00e9. HR is not there for the employee.\n\nNot exactly the same, but your story reminded me of a co worker who had a big vacation planned at the first small bank. He walked out a minute late to say goodbye to all of us, but a few minutes later he walked back in all sad looking.\n\nRight behind him were a bunch of men in suits. They ended up being from the FDIC and alerted us that our bank no longer existed as of that minute and we were owned by the government. We were all forced to work an extra two hours to field questions from customers, and all sick / vacation time was wiped as it no longer existed. I felt so bad for the guy.",

As a team lead/senior software dev there is no fucking chance much will get done for at least a year if that happened.\n\nAssuming you even have the staff / documents / resources to train up that many people again at once. Thats if you have every little single bit written down about how it works. (Most systems don't)",

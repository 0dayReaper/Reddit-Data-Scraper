Series X has triple the GPU power, 60% more memory, and 2.5x the memory speed compared to Series S.

Saying something is full of something doesn't mean it's exclusively made up of whatever. Most of the games during the event were from Microsoft owned studios. \n\n&gt; What current xbox only games have you played in the past month?\n\nForza Horizon 5 and some Gears 1 &amp; 3. As I said elsewhere, I'm not really a fan of either console's exclusives. I assume you'll also want to know which current Playstation games I've played in the past month and I can safely say I have played none, so by this airtight logic I think we can safely conclude that no one is interested in playing Playstation exclusives. \n\nlol",

If you have a 4K TV in your living room but play games on a different, 1080P TV/monitor, you\u2019re still being counted as part of the 4K crowd. Also, like I said, not everyone even cares about the resolution difference.

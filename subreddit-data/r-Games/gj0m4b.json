The introduction of CAD software completely revolutionized the way architecture firms produced their design drawings, as it evolved to allow a single person to output an amount of finished work that used to take a a whole bunch of people. Architecture firms used to have teams of 'draftsmen' that would be necessary to produce all of the drawings, but that job became obsolete and firms got rid of those teams. \n\nBut even after all of that, tons of architecture firms still tend to operate in an almost permanent 'crunch' mode. They didn't respond to increased efficiency by making anybody's job easier, they just increased the amount of work they expected everyone to produce in order to keep them busy all the time.",

It's like loading times in games, they don't disappear as technology gets better, the games just get bigger. Maybe they get more manageable, but they'll never disappear. \n\nBeing able to develop faster will just mean the projects get bigger, which means they will still need to crunch at the end.",

By making their assets scale-able they can easily just take entire environments from star wars and put it into a game. Meaning, we could probably have a Mandalorian game using the exact environments in the show. Just slap those environments and assets into Jedi Fallen Order and bam, you got a new star wars game. The entire package is going to be very very exciting for both film and video games as all of this combined means more efficiency.",

This means that their algorithm is designed to encode constant framerates of 30 and under (though it is not limited to this and paid accounts get priority support, even for higher framerates). Because of this specialization, it means the algorithm can support a much higher bit rate for supported videos.\n\nBecause it is a premium service, uploads are limited, so they can prioritize larger uploads from paying clients and provide them at a more stable render rate, regardless of size. Vimeo also offers its content creators its pay-on-demand service to sell their content, but that also comes with the upper tiers of subscription.\n\nLong story short, if you need to showcase the visuals of your content at their absolute best to an audience that is going to pay good money for your product (like the tech demo of the latest version of the biggest game engine in the world or a feature film where you *really* need the blacks to be true black and not spotty ugliness *cough cough YouTube and HBONow*), then Vimeo is the obvious choice.\n\nYouTube is ultimately about reaching a diverse audience with content that doesn't need to have excellent visual fidelity. This tradeoff however means that a company with resources from its parent company Alphabet is able to produce significantly larger number of uploads, as well as providing access to a wider range of content.",

Of course in a tech demo, they would push things to the max to show you what the engine is technically capable of. But I assume it's like Unity's ADAM demo; no Unity game actually looks like that.\n\nI don't think this is the end for baked lighting, polygon budgets, normal maps, or LODs. There's probably things we don't know going behind the scenes, like perhaps optimizations for rendering many copies of the same object (possibly even requiring them to be static) that allowed them to render all those statues, or carefully applied occlusion culling, etc.\n\nThat's not to say that this demo isn't impressive, or that none of these capabilities will be useful at all. I just don't think every Unreal Engine 5 game will be like what you see in this demo, or even any game that isn't specifically made to be a tech demo.",

It fakes things like depth and curvature.\n\nIf we can really use the high poly asset, we might not need the normal map anymore.\n\nWhere a 3D model might be 2 million tris and only 16MB compressed, the 4k textures for that asset might be 92MB compressed. This includes maps for base color, ambient occlusion, normal, displacement, and roughness.\n\nIf you have the full high poly detail, you don't need normal and displacement. I don't know how their lighting system will affect the need of AO. **Basically, the more detailed the model the less you have to rely on texture maps for faking detail.**\n\nEdit: You also don't need LOD models with this. Where you might have the high poly model and 3 more lower poly LOD models for rendering at varying distances, now you just need 1 model.",

A major part of modern game asset production is creating super high quality assets, and then carefully 'downgrading' them to bring them within your performance limitations. This is a really complicated task that can involve a bunch of different steps, and requires a good bit of time and skill to do well. If the engine can just deal with the high quality asset then there is a bunch of work that you can skip. \n\nThe high quality real time global lighting is another big one. Currently setting up lighting can be a lot of sort of guessing at what you're doing, then having the computer crunch a 'bake' of the lighting before you can actually see it in game, and then you tweak it again before re-baking. Rinse and repeat until you get the results you want. If the engine lets you just move those lights around in real time, then it'll be so much quicker to set up lighting in your scenes. And great lighting can make mediocre assets look good, while poor lighting can make great assets look terrible. So speeding up that part of the workflow could be huge as well. \n\nNot to mention the ability to modify that global lighting in real-time during the game adds a bunch of cool new opportunities.",

It's more of a stress test on the GPU, memory, and likely disk I/O.\n\nTo elaborate, all the stuff that makes games interactive (AI of enemies or NPCs, business logic of game systems, whatever) is clearly not in this game demo, so it seems like it won't be testing any CPU bottlenecks.  But there is a lot of capability there.",

And its Xen is just much better than the original's, it's not even close.\n\nAnd then on top of that, it has the best gunplay of all the Half-Life games. There's some CS inspiration in there. It's the most fun Half-Life to shoot things in. \n\nThis is the ideal remake. Truly great game. They deserve all the success in the world.",

We get remasters, remakes and sequels aplenty, but most of them are just different games - even if they are good. If a follow-up is genuinely solid, it can virtually eliminate the need to ever go back to the older game, which immediately allows me to recommend 'old' games to friends without having to go \"*oh yeah but you are going to have to suffer through this random thing all games in the 90s did that just fucking sucks*\".\n\nShout-out to Two Point Hospital for letting me revisit Theme Hospital without the downsides of Theme Hospital.",

You've played Black Mesa, not Half Life.\n\nBesides reaching 2023 and not having played  a seminal game like Half Life,   i think it should be played just for the knowledge of it, if nothing else. Its just a 10 hour investment and a hell of a good time.  The recent RTX mod for it makes it perfect to check it out\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btVbRjj9YJo",

This is like calling RE4 remake a mod of the original. \n\nIt literally won Moddb mod of the year in 2012.  No, its nothing alike with RE4.  \n\nYou dont need to exaggerate the game's age to make your point. Hasnt been on anyones radar in decades, when the game is just 2 decades old.  Counter Strike 1.6 and HL2 Episode 3 kept the game in discussion well into the 2010s. \n\nLike i already said, BM is a naturaly more apealing game for recent gamers,  but it doesnt replace Half Life nor is it the same game.  The two people in my post actively looked at HL, but chose against it. Which is fine,  im pointing out that they have not played HL by playing Black Mesa, and also that HL is perfectly playable by itself, even after BM",

Meanwhile, i enjoyed black mesa a lot more. Maybe Half life 1 ist just a lot better than half life 2, but i learned that what people consider classics might not be such great games today. So as long as the goal isnt to specifically play the original and see what made it so popular back in the days, i would always recommend black mesa over it.",

Half-Life's puzzles are so simplistic by modern standards that they don't really even feel like a detractor from the experience, they just break up the pacing while I feel HL2's constant simple physics puzzles really hamper the overall experience.\n\nThey're both great games in their own right, I just always enjoy my Half-Life replays a bit more because I feel it replays more like a nostalgic boomer shooter - \nHL2 often replays more like prototype for things to come later in the decade.\n\nHL2:Ep2 however I find to have aged a bit better as the vehicle segments and physics puzzles are much more engaging overall.",

Feels like the situation with the OG sitcom (maybe Seinfeld?) that now feels super trite and cliched, because it was copied and referenced so many times in subsequent sitcoms.  \n\nHL2 was absolutely groundbreaking when it came out.  I remember downloading the leak when I was at Uni - it blew my mind throwing a mattress down a set of stairs.   I'd never seen anything like that before.  \n\nAs such, the single player experience was amazing back then - I cannot stress how fucking outstanding it was.  I loved the vehicle sections, because it was novel.  I loved the physics puzzels and the gravity gun.    HL2 was exactly what it needed to be in 2004.  It's a shame it's no longer possible to experience it in that context.",

What im stressing here is that someone playing Black Mesa is not playing Half Life.  The general outline might be the same, but at the end of the day its a reimagining by a team of moders,  its not the game Valve made.   Since every level is altered in some way, it doesnt even feel like you're playing the same game.  \n\nHalf Life has its specific feel, movement, AI, gun feel, sounds, atmosphere.  I enjoy Black Mesa and im glad it exists.  But i like Half Life over it in every respect and i'll forever chose to replay it when im in the mood for more HL. \n\nSo if someone never played HL, but went through BM and liked it, i see no reason not to also play HL.",

HL has one of the smoothest and pleasing visuals from that early 3d era.  People are playing Counter Strike 1.6 to this very day, which is a mod for HL, running on its engine. \n\nI think missing one of the most influential and best games of all time would suck for anyone thinking himself a gamer or interested in games",

The only thing would be if you can't handle going to worse graphics after playing the remake but Half Life 2 has been well maintained and looks great today if you get the free graphics patch. \n\nIf you're interested in the franchise for maybe more historical reason, I do think it is worth trying the original game first. It flows well and is short enough.",

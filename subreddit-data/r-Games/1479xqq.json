If you've got no knowledge of Splatoon beyond you saw a trailer once or twice, it's probably... Fine? But if you're making a Splatoon-like, the people who are going to make the most noise about it initially are the existing Splatoon players, and coming from that perspective it looked like it didn't really have many new ideas and *also* was ripping off a lot of Splatoon's existing mechanics one-for-one--like, most of the big flashy moves they showed mapped almost perfectly onto existing Splatoon specials, even ones that were not at all generic and obvious, like Baller.\n\nThey've been slowly letting out things indicating there's more going on via social media supplementary content, and I'm happy to see that in combination with these reports, but I totally understand why the initial reaction was pretty definitively \"Oh this is just off-brand Splatoon\" womp.",

Most recently, they showed you have to basically confirm a kill in melee to actually down someone instead of putting them in a temporary down state they can (presumably) recover from--sorta Apex Legends-y, I guess?--which is definitely a unique dynamic and implies a pretty radically different pace of play from Splatoon.\n\nGlad to hear there's more indication of that from people going hands-on. They probably should have *led* with more of that, but if they can make a recovery and stick the landing here, I'll be ecstatic. XD",

I do worry that it won\u2019t stick though. Rumbleverse and Knockout City were two games I was truly rooting for but didn\u2019t make it. \n\nThe GAAS genre is really hard to break out in. It feels like MMOs back in the day.",

    "postText": "The lastest entry in the historied Final Fantasy franchise (FF16) distinguishes itself in a number of ways from the series' past, not least of which being its story \"style\" and combat elements. Going in fairly blind, playing the demo had me wondering wondering, \"What *is* Final Fantasy?\" And at what point of change does something gain a new identity? Does this entry differ too far? And what has the series' identity been since the departure of its founder, Hironobu Sakaguchi-san?\n\nThe differences in FF16 may be welcome to old and new fans alike, as no one was expecting a return to form with this title. However, if you remove the iconic name and chocobos, comparing FF16 to any Sakaguchi-era entry may leave you hard-pressed to reconcile this entry as being part of the same series. There will always be minor changes, of course, but here the differences lie within the core of the series' strongest defining elements. In 16, we have what seems like (I'm going in blind, remember) a largely individual journey as opposed to a group adventure, an action rpg instead of the old active time battle system, and a Game of Thrones inspired grimdark political narrative vs a classic fantasy epic.\n\nKeep in mind, Final Fantasy has always had an expectation to evolve. The franchise was already known for being particularly malleable after FF7 and the series' success allowed for larger departures with titles such as the beloved FF: Tactics. That being said, any major pivots in identity were designated as side entries\u2014before Sakaguchi-san's departure\u2014while the mainline entries kept a fairly clear vision up to FF9 &amp; 10. FF11 and on were made post-departure and it is painfully obvious to see the impact. From that point on, what defined a mainline entry and, therefore, the core identity of Final Fantasy, became muddled.\n\nPerhaps when the series founder left, a core piece of Final Fantasy did too. That is what I think. And thus, you could say the series died and was reborn. Who knew what the future would hold?\n\nPersonally, I hope we will once again relive the glory days of the Sakaguchi-era, but I welcome FF16 with open arms. That being said, as a long-time fan I couldn't help but feel like I was playing a new series entirely or rather a notable side entry of it. And though this was only the demo, I think it establishes itself fairly clearly. It's pretty, it's fun, and the story seems engaging. But is it Final Fantasy? A case can be made either way.-\n\nThe familiar adage comes to mind; is it the same boat if all the wood is new? But a more apt description may be: is it the same boat if not only the wood is new but the look was entirely renovated, the company merged, the captain left, the crew was replaced, and it sails in a new sea but they kept the name? And oh, what a glorious name.\n\nThough this is a subject for debate, the question remains: What is a Final Fantasy?  \n\n\nEdit: Some people are angry at this post. I'm just asking what makes a game \"Final Fantasy\" outside of the name. It can't be \"anything\" as that would make it have no identity at all. Thank you for your responses.",

You know it's going to be a big, long, polished JRPG with all the tropes you'd expect but ideally also some fun twists and turns that reward you for spending the time with it.\n\nThe beauty of the anthology set-up is that they're also free to experiment with the gameplay structure, a lot moreso than something like a Zelda or Mario which have made certain gameplay elements and characters part of their identity more than the general tone.\n\nThere's also the superficial similarities like the spell and (iirc) item names being consistent across vastly different entries. This has a couple of small but important benefits. It allows players to jump between very different games but still have a general understanding of their abilities very quickly, and it also allows you to make something like FF14 which combines elements from all the games without it feeling like a cheap mash-up.\n\nI'm not even that big a fan of the series, but that's always been my impression at least as a somewhat casual FF player.",

            "comment": "Every Final Fantasy can be considered a major departure from the last. Every single one. They all vary greatly in terms of tone, combat system and character mechanics, and even the visual style in most cases.\n\nThe NES trilogy and first two SNES games share a visual look, sure, but that's arguably because of technical limitations. They're still very different in terms of character mechanics. \n\nLike, you can go back and make this argument as far back as the second game. Or the third. Or the fourth. Etc, etc. How they handle the party (or if the party are even defined characters) varies from entry to entry. Hell, we've got two different MMOs as mainline, numbered entries.\n\nIt's kinda filthy fucking rich at this point to claim that Final Fantasy XVI of all games is where the series is losing any sense of identity. It'd have to have one in the first place to begin with. Very arguably, you could show someone screenshots of every Final Fantasy from V on and if they didn't know the titles, I'd bet they wouldn't identify them as the same series.\n\nEdit: XVI, not XIV.",

I\u2019m not going to assume it\u2019s all one set tone throughout.",

            "comment": "Simply put, a Final Fantasy is literally what it is. It is an entry for a franchise providing a unique experience. \n\nIt is a game to be obsessed about as soon as you start the game through the current technology, and you play the narrative (or when you see fit) all the way to the end where you feel satisfied as the credits roll. This is what I have always expected ever since that first Final Fantasy VII disc was loaded into my PlayStation 1 many, many years ago. I was in awe of the world being presented to me. I was captivated by the main cast of characters with their own personal backstories and arcs. *The music*...lord, when the music plays during pivotal narrative moments.  And of course the easy to understand, yet captivating to master gameplay that kept me playing for hours per play session. Whether it be just exploring on foot or just finishing battle after battle.\n\n\nYoshi P has been stating in interviews a Final Fantasy game should not *just* be something based simply on its \"type of play\" or game system. What worked in the past, worked. What works currently, should work. Simple? Yet Square Enix struggled on that concept for decades. Arguably, they finally nailed something with FFVII remake, yet that concept was only *part* of what helped define FFVII remake from...let's say FFXV, and especially whatever the hell FFXII was. For the longest time I was convinced of what I absolutely loved about Final Fantasy games was only present on a freaking MMO version of FF game. Though somebody over there at SE FINALLY attempted something. So FFVII R showcased some oomph within a new take on a classic that helped  define the experience. It *has* issues, but there was definitely something there that helped make it tolerable to at least experience the first part. \n\nSo in hind sight, a Final Fantasy, particularly great ones, should be many things. Always has been. *THAT* is what a Final Fantasy is for me. \n\nNow! How is Final Fantasy 16 so far in my opinion from playing this demo? It's so far been literally the best first impression of the new original Final Fantasy title in a very, *VERY* long time. It is simply hitting all of what I expect a *good* FF Fantasy entry needs to be. I dare say I'm seeing many elements of older games within it whether they be visual or audio tropes of the series, or simply just whatever it is that causes the \"warm fuzzy feelings\" of replaying some of the SNES entries (akin to FFIV and VI).",

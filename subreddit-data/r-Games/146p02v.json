            "comment": "Sunday: **[Vertex Shifter](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/750991)**. Grid Puzzle game.\n\nThis is a simple puzzle game, where pieces need to be moved or pushed to their destination. Each piece has a limited number of moves, and must reach the destination with the exact number of moves. \n\nThis game introduced a new mechanic near the end, and cut short on it's development. This killed the buildup on how complex the puzzles could be. \n\nMonday: **[ZS Dead Detective vs Nine Deaths Cat](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/698660)**. Point-and click adventure game, detective. \n\nZombie Society is a series of small games, each being a case concerning a crime (usually a theft), and this installment is the introduction to the rival. In this case, Nine Deaths Cat is dropping a series of messages saying she's going to steal from a rich person to steal something he doesn't use. \n\nAs a replay, most of the impact is lost, but the story still seems stable. The thief makes an intentional trail of evidence from previous crimes, and the clues and associated conclusions seem logical. \n\nTuesday: [Robot Taco! Taco!](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/599064). Platformer, ~20 levels. \n\nWednesday: **[Battalion: Vengeance](http://www.kongregate.com/games/urbansquall/battalion-vengeance)**. \n\nThis is the flash implementation of Advance Wars. This campaign seems to involve tactical battles rather than extended combats.\n\nThis is a recovery replay, and the mission was four rocket artillery in a fortified position, while the enemy is taking cover (and can't be attacked). Since the opponent needs time to get through, it requires using artillery in a way that destroys the attackers before they advance too quickly. \n\nThursday: **[The Crew: Mission Deep Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/324856/crew-mission-deep-sea)**. Cooperative trick-taking game.\n\nThis is a trick taking game, where the players must cooperate to complete individual tasks (e.g. getting a specific card, winning an exact number of tricks, etc.)  The standard rules: each player must follow the lead card when possible, and the winner of the trick is the highest of the cards matching the lead suit (or a trump card.)  Only limited communication is possible, signalling a card is either highest or lowest of a given suit. \n\nIn this case, performance wasn't as good as the previous play - requiring a roll back to easier difficulties. \n\nFriday: **[House](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/683412)**. Horror, short length. \n\nThis is a flash demo of a game now released on steam. In this case, the girl needs to survive the night, where daddy arrives and attacks. \n\nThe timer is a bit on the short side, where the player needs to focus on going to the solution almost immediately as opposed to exploring for the solution. \n\nSaturday: **[Raccoon Racing](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/436624)**. Racing game similar to Mario Kart. \n\nIt's a rather light implementation of Mario Kart. 4 racers, and random item pickups. \n\nThe items themselves feel like an afterthought, as one of them is a water spill - that happens on a water track.",

            "comment": "**Ace Combat: Distant Thunder**\n\nAKA Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies outside of ANZ/EU. \n\nIt's hard to beat Electrosphere, but AC4 comes pretty close. This PS2 game seems to mark the start of a persistent world and story in the Ace Combat series. It's not as fantastical as Electrosphere and the story and plane designs are more grounded but it still tells a wonderful story through it's anime cut scenes and epic soundtrack.\n\nThe missions are lengthier with no branches, but very conveniently resupplies are now a thing. Wingmen are absent again, but some allies can be found in missions backing up Mobius 1. There's a much more prevalent use of ground targets in order to create some variety and a need to use planes with different specialisations. I found AC4 to be less challenging as enemies were easier to hit and in turn easier for me to evade compared to the difficulty of Electrosphere. I played through twice to unlock all the alternate plane colours via aces, but didn't have enough cash to buy them all. \n\n\n---\n**Ace Combat: Squadron Leader**\n\nAKA Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War.\n\nThis marks the start of the AC games I haven't played before, so I didn't know what to expect. For the first time, the story is persistent and a sequel to AC4 where Mobius is now a mysterious and legendary war hero and you're a trainee pilot eventually known as Blaze. The story is pretty grounded again and starts to sound like Earth's alternate history with different names. Anime cut scenes have been ditched for pre rendered FMVs and the soundtrack is not quite as great.\n\nThe new levelling system for planes is intriguing. I'm not sure I'm entirely on board as it introduces an grinding into a game that it has no place in. After one entire campaign and a lot of free missions, I'd only incidentally unlocked 2-3 new upgrades through this system. Planes accrued a disappointing amount of exp even on Ace and I see many repeat missions just to unlock all the upgrades.\n\nMissions are very similar to AC4's format. I went all in on Hard which is reduced player health again, however AC5 is the first game found challenging to complete S ranks and had to repeat a few to get there. The point meters are huge in this game. Missions are 15-20 minutes long with dozens of targets but no resupplies so missile use is precious and the need to unlock better planes with more missiles becomes paramount. The wingmen are finally given a better degree of control both in mission and plane selections, but are still pathetic help overall. Best of all, Edge from AC2 has made a return but Slash is nowhere to be seen. They're incorporated into the story to pull at your heartstrings quite effectively.\n\nI'm replaying on Expert to get the remaining medals and grinding those plant levels to tick this off as 100% complete.",

            "comment": "**Blasphemous** - I'm finding this game to be a bit of a mixed bag. I have no idea what's happening in the story. I'm not sure why anything is happening, had happened or what happened but I'm a man with a pointy hat who poured blood in it running around exploring.\n\nThe exploration is sublime though, and the Blashemous devs have shown mastery of how to create a metroidvania through making every environmnetal ability count. Unlike say...Bloodstained where you got that phase shift ability but then only use it a couple of times, Blasphemous ensures that its environs are littered with places that make you use your abilities constantly. It also helps that the rewards you get are actually useful! So you're rewarded for exploring and not just getting junky items!\n\nCombat is a mixed bag. It pulls the Souls' abilities, dodge and parry, but here they feel inconsistent. Parrying doesn't seem to work on a lot of attacks but there are bosses that demand you use it. It feels like the timing window is all over the place and it just feels like a mechanic that's unpolished. Bayonetta 1 perfected both dodging and parrying and every game should be approaching those two abilities like that. \n\nAnother issue is the DLC. As a new guy to the game, I get the fully loaded game including post game DLC clearly needing a stronger character. But as it is a Metroidvania, I have bumped into many areas where you don't notice something's not right until you're doing tiny damage or being destroyed in a few hits. The game just has not been built to let players know that they may need to get stronger before approaching some areas.\n\nBut I do like the game and it's atmosphere and any time I get one of those cutscenes, I'm in awe at how disgustingly beautiful it all is. It has a stunnning art direction. Truly, a metroidvania that stands out.",

I have seen some complaints online about the parry timings and dodging, but I personally didn't have too much of a problem with them. I can see the devs loosening and tightening combat before sept though.",

            "comment": "**Persona 4 Golden**\n\nThis is a very nostalgic game for me even though I never beat it. I played the original Persona 4 when it first released on PS2 but stopped playing it after Kanji's palace because I was a kid with attention span of a goldfish. I started playing it again a few days ago (steam remaster) because I was in a mood for a JRPG (even though I'm not much of a JRPG player). It's been quite enjoyable experience, despite some shortcomings. I beat Persona 5 (base version) and played about 2 hours of Persona 3 like 15 years ago and have no experience with Persona or SMT series outside of that. I just beat &gt;!detective girl's dungeon!&lt;.\n\nI'll start off with some negatives. I don't really like the procedurally generated dungeons. They are quite interesting design-wise, especially &gt;!Void Quest!&lt; and music is good to great. However, they feel much more limited and same-y compared to P5. I also wish P4 had safe rooms because dungeons become exhausting the way they currently are. The fact that inactive party members don't get any experience is stupid and annoying in every single game and basically means that I'll have my core group that I use and the rest of the party members are pointless because I will never bother leveling them. The writing in the game is questionable. I like the characters and overall story so far but dialogue is poor (not as bad as P5 which was downright shit more often than not). There are some genuinely well written scenes and dialogues but there's a lot of trash as well. I also hate the repetitive non-statements that are very frequent in a lot of JRPGs that I've played (\"Let's do our best\", \"He's working so hard\", \"I'll never forgive them\", etc..). The game is also not pretty. I know it's a remaster of a ps2 game but character models look off for some reason and there are definitely games from that time period that have much better models.\n\nOn the bright side, as I mentioned, I'm really enjoying the story so far (even though I think the big reveal was spoiled for me in a random reddit comment). I like most of the party members in P4 more than P5. Music is not as good as P5 but still pretty damn good. The atmosphere and setting of a small, foggy town murder mystery is absolutely incredible. I've always enjoyed that sort of thing in TV shows and books so I'm loving it here. While overall dialogue is poor and a lot of humour doesn't really land for me, there were a couple of scenes, namely &gt;!the ongoing gag with all of the main girls being terrible cooks and the beach trip where Kanji loses his speedos!&lt; that had me in tears from laughing too much. I also really enjoy the overall gameplay loop of going to school, hanging out with people, doing part time jobs and exploring the various dungeons. It becomes a really comfy routine very early on and is just very enjoyable. Character portraits are very well done and the game has a very unique sense of style that's weaker than P5 but still very strong.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying the game. It's got me very excited for the upcoming Persona 3 remake as well as new entry in the series. Also, we need more small town murder mystery games with weird and occult shit going on.",

But dungeon wise, I don't think any of the games have gotten good at the dungeon making. They can make visually nice looking dungeons but rarely are they fun to play.

            "comment": "**Diablo 4**\n\nThis game was purchased for $69.99.\n\nIn the past three days, I've essentially no-lifed the game. During which, I've completed the campaign and raised a melee Rogue to 55. Obviously it's too early for me to comment on the End Game, (Though I have some...concerns, depending on Blizzard's choices) in terms of a single play experience, I'd say it was the best ARPG campaign I've experienced aside from the OG Diablo with nostalgia intact.\n\nThe game is flush with undeniable polish. The environments look great, all of the abilities and spells have the appropriate weight and feel, and the voice acting is effectively spot on. If my computer weren't a baked potato I probably wouldn't notice the transition between certain in-engine scenes and pre-rendered ones as much. If one were to railroad the story from start to finish doing naught but the main campaign it'd be hard to deny a satisfying adventurer.\n\nBut that is where my frustrations begin, because to do so would be to deny one of this game's big selling points. The massive open world. A Disneyland sized theme park filled with statues, quests, and dungeons to pillage and plunder. Which I *tried* to do in Act 1 and realized that despite the intent this is unfortunately a really bad idea.\n\nI'll come out and say it: I think the level scaling is a big mistake. Not only for reasons many have said (Where you don't *feel* stronger until level 50 since everything is rising with you) but because to me it gives a false impression of what's practical. For my own fault, I went into a dungeon at level 5, that was marked as level 5 and thought I'd be fine.\n\nNo. The damage and health values might scale, but mechanics don't. And I ran into this hard when I ran smack into a Spider Boss that would: Constantly bombard the arena with poison bombs and circles. Flood the arena with hard to see snare traps that would lock you in place for three seconds. Spawn enemies that explode into smaller enemies. And finally randomly knock you back across the room, possibly into other snares and poison.\n\nNaturally I couldn't kill it. I had to come back at about level 15 when I had more skills to use, and even then it was a *miserable* struggle. And I slammed my head into multiple dungeons thinking this was expected and normal. It's not. At level 55 on World Tier 3 with a mostly finished build I basically faceroll bosses now. There is no benefit to doing a dungeon early unless you really want a Legendary affix from it ASAP.\n\nWas it my fault for thinking I should've been able to do this content too early? Maybe, but given how it's signposted I have to imagine other people ran into this, though maybe not as stubbornly as I did.\n\nThe other cool feature, Strongholds suffer from the same issue. And I *love* strongholds. Yes, they're just outdoor dungeons but they have a cool mini-story in them. For example, there is one that is just entombed in ice by a bunch of Goatmen, and as you pick it apart the ice begins to thaw and you can read on what happened to the town. And when you finish it, you often get a new town with a bunch of quests and a waypoint. It feels like you are helping to heal the world.\n\nBut trying to do them before level 50 is just an act of masochism. I got so frustrated trying to deal with this one boss that had four phases, trying to duck and dive around tornados, summoned birds,  and a big ass 1.5 second channeled ground slam I almost quit. \n\nThere is this frustrating paradigm where all of the bosses are at the same time absurdly overdesigned with phases, ground circles, adds you *need* to kill your they explode, etc, or you just wait til 50 and face roll them.\n\nAn Open world where all you can sanely do is the main campaign, fetch quests, and find Lillith statues. I'm honestly not a fan of it. But I'm playing Melee, which in ARPGs is usually the harder way to do it. So if your at range this might not be as big a con.\n\nSo all else I really have to contribute are my concerns about the future. The seasonal model is the plan, and while the Lillith statues carry over nothing else has been said to do so yet. Which would  mean that if you wanted to re-grind a character, you'd need to do the renown grind again. And you'd be a fool not too, since 5 skill points and 20 Paragon Levels and 5 potion capacity is a *huge* amount of power and healing to just leave on the table. I legit would just never bother with a seasonal character by that point if I had to re-grind the EXP *and* a bunch of \"Go here and fetch a thing\" or \"Go kill a bunch of zombies and fill a bar\" guff to get those features back each time.\n\nOverall, once I realized that not focusing the maincampaign from the start was a mistake I had a better time with it. Learn from my mistake. Don't bother with dungeons and Strongholds until level 40 at minimum.",

I tend to skip them, fuck hidden object or jigsaw, but there are 9 different kinds here. turns out only their names are original(ish) and they're still jigsaw and simon says and whatnot. oh well, the game's still pretty good, a lot more complex overall than I expected, also a bit tedious in the final stretch despite all the power-ups. would've been an easy recommendation but the final puzzle is broken, had to alt+f4 and next time I was greeted with a trophy for completing the game instead of the ability to try again maybe (without re-doing the really long final level), so it has to be a [thumbs down](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/2338130). shame.\n\n**[force of nature 2 (demo):](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244800/)** I played the first game almost exactly a year ago, even wrote a [review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/568570) because it could've been so great if it wasn't for all the shitty design decisions (saving or quiting respawns mobs, stamina for everything, real-time crafting, etc.).\n\nI read the sequel allows some customization, you can sleep or quit without respawning everything being one of them, so I kept this wishlisted despite real-time crafting, and wasn't expecting a demo 2 years after release but hey. so I tried it, knowing it'd get un-wishlisted because of crafting fuckery alone. and it did. there's even a 'slower crafting' setting. why the fuck would anybody want that? stronger enemies, sure (not for me), bigger inventory, again, sure (also for me), but not that.\n\nand I don't remember **having to stand next to something for it to get built, moved or sometimes even crafted**, it's fucking ridiculous. you literally can't do anything until whatever it is gets done in minutes or however long (more based on a higher amount). storage is a joke as well. stack limits are the worst but I can easily carry 20 stones in one slot, yet a stone storage 'building' can only hold 7 (or 18 if it's lvl2, which needs more advanced knowledge). all I want is a simple chest with 20 slots to dump whatever but nope, you can have a basket with 7 slots, then later a chest with 14 slots. critical damage isn't passive with a chance either, gotta use it as a skill, same as before. and looks like dropped stuff despawns now, or rather turns into garbage. another change nobody asked for I'm sure. animals shit everywhere, that remains forever.\n\nI finished the demo, as in went to the story place when I was told to. it unlocks teleporters to areas not in the demo. enemies are no match for my stone pick (a welcome improvement), but had to benny hill a bunch when a few big-ass bears showed up, followed me to the ghost dude as well, then got stuck on an inactive teleporter and I could cheese them. yum. the ghost has a teleport home ability and can aid with crafting and building in a superficial way even if you're not at home, that's something.\n\ngotta place regular teleporters relatively close to each other, just like in the first game, but at least each can go to the teleport hub to other worlds, didn't expect that. with a big fucking inaccessible mountain in the middle of the map, I'd need 4 or 5 to reach the teleport hub from home (then directly of course) and each needs a bunch of claws or bones, only dropped by some mobs sometimes. great stuff. haven't found a single piece of copper either.\n\nno respawns is a good thing, but of course it's less xp (only awarded for combat, can't farm or craft your way to success, though the latter would deplete resources fast and those don't appear again) and respawning every mob every now and then is out of the question.\n\nwith more options (instant crafting, no stamina, no stack limits, enemies can't destroy your shit), manual saving anytime over multiple slots, brightness settings and a variable camera angle (it's the same shit as before), plus a balanced game mode (or story mode or whatever you wanna call it) where clearing an entire location once would be enough xp-wise to progress through the game, I wouldn't even need a 90% discount like the first time, here's 10 bucks, about 30% off, which already happened, done. it runs great on my shitty pc as well, didn't expect that. oh well... maybe fon5 in 15 more years will finally get things right, though I assume the fundamentals won't ever change. so my quest for the next crafting/survival(ish) game I can enjoy continues.\n\n([last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1406xzj/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/jmunwtr/))",

Have finished three planets and now heading off to find arks.\n\nBit buggy though, and character modelling not as good as the trilogy. Choices don\u2019t seem to mean much, but I\u2019m here to RP not to optimise victory conditions.",

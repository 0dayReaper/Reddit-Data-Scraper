You were essentially renting your cosmetics on a per-save basis.",

You're getting someone to buy in at a higher price point than they otherwise would have. Keeping the individual season pass price high encourages people to buy the combo deal rather than buying the base game first to test the waters. \n\nThey don't care about existing customers because A)DLC sales are always significantly poorer than base game sales and B) Those people are already invested in the game, and the ones still playing are much more likely to buy the DLC regardless of price. \n\nIt's shitty but that's why they do it.",

I have a big enough backlog that I just wait for the \"complete edition\", whenever that may come. Usually a year+ out of release. In some cases, I don't even care to grab the game.\n\nI guess they must be making money hand over fist from people not like me, because the practice continues so I would think its working for them. But for myself, there's literally been games where I just don't ever end up buying it at all because of all the hoops.\n\nI'm looking at my Steam list of games right now and I still need to play Elden Ring, Hi-Fi Rush, Nier: Automata, God of War. So why would I buy Midnight Suns when its not *yet* feature complete and may even be sold at a significant discount by the time I have time to play it anyways.  But again, if their system is working for them, then I guess I'm just in the minority.",

The main difference is that developers now tell you their plans for how many DLCs they plan on making.\n\nBut for instance, Morrowind's \"Tribunal\" expansion released something like 6? months after the game's initial release. There is 0% chance that Bethesda weren't already developing Tribunal as their development wound down on the base game.\n\nBut I think nobody in their right mind would call Morrowind an \"incomplete game, wait for the goty edition\" on release, because the base game released in a complete state.\n\nA lot of games *do* release in incomplete states, but that's not really a consequence of the season pass imo so much as it is a consequence of looming, immutable release dates and feature creep.\n\nFor another example, Borderlands 2 was the first campaign oriented \"single player\" game I ever saw sell a season pass. And ***NOBODY*** would call the base Borderlands 2 game incomplete. Despite that, the Mechromancer and the first expansion pack released within a month of the game's release.",

Then don't forget that the people who were interested in a new Firaxis release were xcom players, and this game was not xcom in any way so they didn't play it either. \n\nAnd ya, the Abby stuff is often talked about negatively for a reason even amongst people who like the game. \n\nreddit sure does love this game, but reddit is a tiny minority of players. Fact is that most people didn't like or weren't interested in this... also the being a full price game + price of the season pass + MTX didn't help it",

That's what I wanted.\n\nWhen I got it, I learned it was basically a CCG with some minor tactical positioning. And that a HUGE part of it was the Fire Emblem-esque social component.\n\nInitially I hated it. But as I gave it more of a chance, and played it for what it IS, not what I THOUGHT it was, I ended up absolutely loving it. Combat was fun, even if I felt the CCG elements detracted from it (I don't like CCGs in general, I'd rather have a 60% chance to hit than a 60% chance to draw a card I need). And I really actually enjoyed the social element. It was *fun* getting to know and befriending these various Marvel characters.\n\nDamn shame the game didn't sell well, because you can tell a lot of effort and care went into this game.",

Do you also expect people to spell out things like \"RPG\" or \"FPS\"? Some terms are just common jargon within a hobby, and \"CCG\" falls under that heading here\u2014and it's also [insanely easy to google and immediately turn up the right explanation](https://www.google.com/search?q=ccg+game).\n\nIt's fine to ask instead of looking it up yourself, but to turn around and then say the problem is the person who used a really common abbreviation related to the sub's topic... That's what kills *me*.",

Someone that matters to them deeply.  Why is that somehow not worthwhile for you?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** I have decide to simply withdraw from the below conversation.  Getting told I was upset over and over again while trying to discuss the issue got very old very fast.  Temporarily blocking those involved since the conversation wasn't going anywhere productive and everyone is, as always, free to make up their own minds.\n\n\nMostly I just wanted to be clear that I don't think social relationship systems in games HAVE to be romantic to be interesting.  And I definitely didn't find the conversations in game generic, though they were relatable most times and not some sort of crazy anime or wartime stuff.  Keep in mind that comic book characters remain popular BECAUSE they are relatable.  It's not the fantastic things that make comic book characters stand the test of time.  It's how human and relatable they are. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMaybe sometimes in games we taste a little too much power fantasy.  I loved 3 Houses.  I'll even do a deep cut and say [Thousand Arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Arms) a game where you literally power up your RPG character via romance sim.  I don't want those kind of games to go away.  But maybe...maybe not every game has to be one of those.  Maybe we can get some like Marvel Suns as well every now and then.  Where we just focus on the characters.  Without having to try and force romance or something more wacky into it like Michael Bay in an early transformers movie :D.\n\nMaybe a game like Persona or 3 Houses is fine like it is, but a game like Engage or Marvel Midnight Suns is also fine as it is.  Funny as it would be to pair up Deadpool and Magik or be able to knock boots with the entire Avengers it's prolly not the right call :D.  That's all im saying lol.",

The combination of this with the tactics is what makes it a compelling series to me. You take one of those out, and I'm not interested. That's why I didn't buy Engage.\n\nWhat's your problem?",

Xcom 2, Chosen expansion, Chimera squads also got a lot of flaks. In general, Firaxis always makes their games as new users friendly as possible rather than going deep into the strategic end. MS was successful imo in what it tried to do, to spice up the dead formula of strategy game. The theme and brand are what ruined the game, not the core gameplay",

We may not get a new XCOM nor a sequel to this either now, and that is a shame.\n\nI hope it finds a larger audience now that all the DLC is out.",

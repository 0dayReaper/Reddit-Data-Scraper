How much of the original FF7 does this Final Fantasy 7 project cover? Remake only went as far as Midgar, which was practically the tutorial area of the original. There's a lot of ground, and therefore a lot of graphical assets (time and moeny), to even cover the geography of the original.\n\n2. Does Square Even plan to match the original game in terms of scope given that Remake obviously wants to go its own way after the Whisperers and all of the extra jazz they added?\n\n3. How much will the spin-off FF7 games matter? Intergrade was a huge Dirge of Cerberus story tease, which I loved. Does these mean we can expect more Deep Ground? Or even some Crisis Core?\n\nMy cynical millennial brain can't believe they intend to include ALL of FF7, let alone the spin-off material. I'd love them too, I just can't see it with present day AAA resources, let alone costs.",

Realistically, I don't think SE made the whole first game about Midgar because they literally couldn't fit anything else in the game, but because it was the only logical stopping point in the story that they could reach without rushing or cutting anything. Midgar was also very story-dense in the original game, so the other two parts might not require way more cinematics and dialogue than the first part.",

Aerith lives in the City of the Ancients, but because she lived the party loses. The same time fuckery that brought Zack back to life is going to send Aerith back to die. Maybe Zack has to go back to die as well. Maybe they symbolize that by reprising the visual of Aerith and Zack walking away into the light from Advent Children.",

I mean... it's FFVII right. People would buy a kart game with characters from it no matter how shit it was implemented... oh wait.\n\nThe fact people keep arguing that \"triple A gaming\" budgets have changed the landscape of development of large scale FF titles when we have multiple massive games released in similar complexity and if not larger scale points to that being an absolute bullshit excuse.\n\nWon't stop them going to bat for padding out Midgar to a 30 plus hour experience full of such interesting side quests as finding 3 cats and hugely needed exposition about man who rides his bikes in more ways than one.",

Or even some Crisis Core?  \n\nI don't think it was a huge tease. We spend 15 minutes in the Deep Grounds, and it was a pretty unimportant bit.\n\nWe will probably spend a bit more there for Vincents story, but that's probably it.",

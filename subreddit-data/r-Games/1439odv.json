Greedfall, while a fantasy setting, was clearly America-inspired and allowed you to choose whether to aid the natives or colonists. Expeditions: Conquistador is basically this premise inverted, in that you're a Spanish conquistador who can choose how sympathetic you are to the natives. And of course EU4's had the colonization of Mexico (among many, many other places) forever. It's not clear why it'd be a source of drama for this game specifically.",

For the natives, it's simply \"to repel the newcommers\".  For the Conquistadors however, they've been painted a very rosy picture.  They're being painted as benevolent invaders.  Their motive is to simply \"liberate the natives from sacrifice making priests\", which if that isn't a fucking foghorn of a dog whistle I don't know what is.",

This is more of a small team trying to make a AAA game, which is very hard to do and has a large risk of looking derivative or half-assed. This game does seem heavily inspired by Ghost of Tsushima and Assassin's Creed, but still above \"asset flip\".\n\nI don't think the game has that much of a chance at succeeding though. Trying to do AAA levels of polish with a much lower budget usually ends up being mediocre. And we've seen the formula of the mentioned games a lot already, with more time and budget behind it than this team has.\n\nThen there's the actual point of the article: giving in to the loudest, nastiest voices concerning the politics is kind of a cop out imo. Like the article says it would be better if they stuck to their original vision. Appeasing racists never ends and doesn't work. They'd only be happy if the conquistadors were the total good guys, and then they still may not actually buy the game, while more progressive people may be turned off by this appeasement. This game could go down as the one that gave in to the alt-right only to lose what little chance it had.",

Both the post announcing it and the store page paints the conquistadors in a very rosy light.  The Aztec's motives is now simply \"to repel the newcommers\".  The conquistadors are already being painted as benevolent invaders who are simply invading to \"liberate them from their sacrificing priests\".  \n\nAnd given how quickly they've turned to that, one has to wonder if that was the original plans for the game and they simply hid the conquistador side of it until the nationalists saw and got very vocal for that part of the game.",

I don't think the team was already going to do the Spanish side of things and only revealed it now, like you say. It may well be that the team never had clear and strong knowledge of the setting they want to use. It feels like a bull in a china shop kind of situation. Maybe they mostly wanted to do an Assassin's Creed type game in a somewhat lesser known setting, without enough research. Giving in so quickly and completely feels like they weren't on strong ground to begin with.\n\nI don't have very high hopes for the gameplay or the technical state of the game so far. And while the setting could offer something compelling, I think that might require better writers and more historic knowledge than this team has. Or a better vision and some conviction. Hope to be proven wrong though.",

Even a big studio would require huge resources to even begin such a project. You can't just change the protagonist and expect the game to make sense. You'd need to have separate campaign that only share assets, at LEAST.\n\nThis makes no sense. Was this project even real to begin with?

Still a massive increase in workload though, since you now have twice the number of possible enemies as well as story outcomes. Also it makes no goddamn sense for an Aztec to join the conquistadors. Sure, there are some tribes that joined them and then were subsequently stabbed in the back, but the premise of the game is you playing as an Aztec, not as a member of one of the subjugated nations.\n\nAlso as other people have mentioned, it's not historically inaccurate because the \"conquistadors are shown at the bad guys!\" (wtf), but the entire aesthetic of the people of the game is Mayan even though the game claims that they're Aztec, and they are shown to inhabit ruins for some reason even though this would have taken place when their empire was doing fairly well.\n\nAnd not one of these people complained about actual historical inaccuracies. Just that they wanted the conquistadors to be shown as the \"good guys\".  \n\n\nEdit: I've posted this elsewhere, but the people pushing for this also created a domain in the developer's name to push fascist propaganda. In case there were any doubts of their insincerity in pushing for \"historical accuracy\". [Source](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23750006/ecumene-aztec-giantscraft-games-ecumene-games)",

It was locked in perpetual forever war with The Flower Wars.  Which were brutal conflicts where the losers were either sold as slaves or sacrificed.   The Aztecs made A Lot of enemies doing this and when the chance came for new allies to help fuck them up they jumped at the chance.  \n\nSecond, for a lot of the people who joined the Spanish it was absolutely a better deal than they got with the Aztecs.  For decades after the fall of the Aztecs the Spanish crown had very little control over the colony so the monarchs did what kings always do when trying to secure a place politically.  They started marrying off their daughters and sons to Spanish nobles and their children.  It was the direct descendants of these native kings that the nobility of Mexico developed.

This was said to honor their gods in a way far greater than killing enemy soldiers in the battlefield. For a warrior to kill an enemy was considered clumsy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_warrior)",

Accusing a non modern state of cultural genocide  is hilariously silly because the concept didn't exist and wouldn't exist for 400 years.  \n\nThe Spanish Aztec war was not radically different than continental wars aside again from disease which they unknowingly carried it was not a particularly brutal war by the standards of Europe.",

            "comment": "This is a long summary but hopefully will catch you up if you're interested in this, and the crazy historical revisionism taking place by the Devs and the right-wing 'fans'. I've been covering this on my YouTube channel (I'm The Kavernacle - I'll link the videos at the end if people are interested). \n\nI was someone who tweeted about the game and the tweets got like tens of millions of views and just absolutely dog piled by the Far-Right. I've seen the absolute gutter of humanity this week. People fully posting about how 'good' colonialism and genocide was very casually in my replies. I do have a history degree and I did like two semesters on Spain and the New World, but honestly that doesn't really matter here in seeing this racist garbage (but did help me debunk these myths). \n\nSo basically the game was announced and went viral on social media for different reasons. One was because it clearly doesn't have any Aztec depiction in it, it seems based on the Mayans and Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. People who love history didn't like it because it looked very stereotypical, and perhaps even racist. \n\nBut then, in Elon Musk's wonderful twitter cesspool, the Far-Right were just brigading the IGN comments section under the game announcement, saying they wanted to play as the 'Good Guys' aka the Spanish. Some of it was insanely gross with people that had verified ticks and their own names and faces in their profile saying they wanted to genocide those 'savages' as the good guy Spanish. I'm not joking it was straight up Nazi shit at times.\n\nThe developers of the game are Polish btw, and basically gave in to this backlash. They say they are making the game more historically accurate (they aren't I will get on to that). And you can now side with the Spanish. \n\nI tweeted out the games updated description which was frankly pretty disgusting (https://twitter.com/thekavernacle/status/1665265622010281988?s=46&amp;t=5NBjUVYap1Av0BIPzWCCtw) \n\nIf you want to see the types of people now interested in the game look at the quote tweets here ^, lots of prominent far-right accounts including Cernovich posting memes about ending human sacrifice. \n\nBasically the Polish Devs now give you the option, as an Aztec Warrior, to side with the Spanish conquistadors and 'save your people' from human sacrifice. Which is completely playing into racist myths about native groups pushed by the Spanish at the time, and now part of the Spanish 'White Legend', a pro-colonialist view of their history. I'm not saying Aztecs didn't do human sacrifice, or sometimes cannibalism, but even at the time contemporary chronicles admitted they lied about this to justify colonialism. In Cortez's own letter to the Spanish royals he offered no evidence but hearsay. \n\nThe developers say they are changing all these things to be more 'historically accurate' but they aren't. They seem to be getting confused. For an Aztec warrior there wouldn't be a debate about who to side with. Like why would he betray his own people because of human sacrifice? When the people invading with the Spanish do the exact same thing? This was a normal religious ritualistic practice in many native culture in Mexico - it wouldn't be a motivator in this context for Aztecs to side win Spain and Tlaxcala. \n\nAnd on that note: Now there were actual Native groups who sided with the Spanish, primary the Tlaxcala who had been at war with the Aztecs for decades. But the Tlaxcala also practiced human sacrifice, they were very similar to the Aztecs. \n\nSo although the Aztecs sacrificed Tlaxcala POWs, the Spanish themselves didn't fight the Aztecs to end this practice as a primary goal, nor did the Tlaxcala. The Spanish exploited native divisions and the Tlaxcala saw an opportunity to get rid of their main foe. The scale of the Spanish brutality shows 'liberation' was not a priority - they had also butchered the Tlaxcala before the alliance too.\n\nSo the Polish Dev team putting in language like 'Spanish Liberators' who wanted to end human sacrifice is laughable revisionism, and completely to pandering to the far-right. Who let's be honest won't buy this game anyway. \n\n\n\nmy videos covering it and debunking all these historical myths can be found here: https://youtu.be/5m7Nbt-039Y\n\nand this one from this morning here: https://youtu.be/HIB0c2kVJzw",

We often see the introduction of diseases in the Pre-Columbian exchange as an accidental thing that obviously sucks but there was nothing to be done at the time. While it was accidental introduction, the conditions the Spanish kept the thousands of new 'laborers' in horrifically increased the spread of disease. \n\n&gt; The social and physical environment of Colonial Mexico was likely key in allowing the outbreak of 1545\u20131548 to reach the heights that it did. Following the conquest, the Spanish colonists forced the Aztecs and other Indigenous peoples onto easily governable reducciones (congregations) that focused on agricultural production and conversion to Christianity.[15][16] Weakened by war and chronic disease outbreaks, the native peoples' health suffered further under the new system.[16] The reducciones brought people and animals in much closer contact with one another. Animals imported from the Old World were potential disease vectors for illnesses.[17] The Aztecs and other Indigenous groups affected by the outbreak were disadvantaged due to their lack of exposure to zoonotic diseases.[17] Given that many Old World pathogens may have caused the cocoliztli outbreak, it is significant that all but two of the most common species of domestic mammalian livestock (llamas and alpacas being the exceptions) come from the Old World.[18]\n\n&gt; At the same time, droughts plagued Central America, with tree-ring data showing that the outbreak occurred during a megadrought.[3] The lack of water may have worsened sanitation and hygiene. Megadroughts were reported before both the 1545 and 1576 outbreaks.[3] Additionally, periodic rains during a supposed megadrought, such as those hypothesized for shortly before 1545, would have increased the presence of New World rats and mice.[19] These animals may have carried arenaviruses capable of causing hemorrhagic fevers.[20] The effects of drought, combined with the crowded settlements, could explain disease transmission, especially if the pathogen was spread by feces.[21]",

Yes, Europeans didn't have a germ model of disease, and the models they did use were inaccurate. However, they weren't stupid. They knew how disease spread and they knew about the importance of treatment and medicine. The use of the plague and diseased corpses as a weapon, and the quarantining and containment of epidemics to prevent outbreaks of various diseases were well established in European science and would have been familiar territory.\n\n[ Native Americans relied on similar measures to control disease outbreaks that Europeans did, with evidence that they'd control access to areas to limit spread, separate vulnerable members from the sick, and give treatment as necessary when available.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3491697?seq=6) In the worst case scenario, entire cities would be depopulated as the native inhabitants would abandon dense urban living for more decentralized homes in surrounding areas, thereby reducing contact and spread. \n\nNone of these measures are possible when there's an invading force and a war on. Refugees flood into urban areas, swelling population centers to their breaking points both in terms of availability of care and density. Cities become hotbeds of disease. Medicine and care is disrupted by broken supply lines and resource shortages. Proper measures of isolation and containment go out the window. Etc. etc. \n\nEuropeans understood this. We know they did because hurling corpses, feces, and urine at besieged towns and fortifications to worsen their medical situation was a common technique. See the sieges of Caffa, Karolstein, and Reval. \n\nIn addition, [smallpox](https://users.pop.umn.edu/~rmccaa/aha2004/whypox.htm) and [other plagues](https://www.jstor.org/stable/205099) weren't even the main factor in [the depopulation of the Americas.](https://www.amazon.com/Cherokee-Medicine-Colonial-Germs-Indigenous/dp/0806146885) War, conquest, [ethnic cleansing and active genocide were.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/books/review/an-american-genocide-by-benja.html)",

A lot of the ruling families of those other tribes held governor positions in their regions for generations\n\nLiterally none of this is true. The Spanish implemented the nightmarish [encomienda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encomienda) system where land was granted too a conquistador and they were given a monopoly on all labor in that province for non-Christians. Aka all native peoples were enslaved and given to white landowners.\n\n&gt;The encomienda system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an Hispaniola encomendero named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Ta\u00edno cacique Enriquillo rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, Emperor Charles V, realizing the seriousness of the Ta\u00edno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of people labouring in the encomiendas.[22] Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Ta\u00ednos and the audiencia was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also actively prosecuted abuses of the encomienda system, through the Laws of Burgos (1512\u201313) and the New Laws of the Indies (1542).\n\n&gt;The priest of Hispaniola and former encomendero Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.[23] He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the encomienda system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an important debate, where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the encomienda system.[24] The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the Viceroyalty of Peru. When Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela, the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the encomienda, many of the encomenderos were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.\n\nThis system was so abusive and horrible that it was controversial in the 1500s in Spain. The same guys looking at the *actual* Spanish Inquisition looked at this and though \"hey guys this is a little much y'know\". There was also zero democracy in New Spain or any other Spanish viceroyalties. There was a reason Simon Bolivar became a big deal and Mexico had a big ole thing about it.\n\nSitting here and comparing two empires is pointless, they were both bad. But the Spanish Empire was an especially horrific thing in its own way, both in severity and scale. Don't try to downplay it.",

                                    "comment": "Its worth noting that Aztec cannibalism is a controversial subject. Some historians deny it happening at all, and most believe that it was less common then the Spanish would have you believe.\n\n&gt;The Mexica of the Aztec period are perhaps the most widely studied of the ancient Mesoamerican peoples. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that ritual cannibalism took place in the context of human sacrifices, they do not support Harris' thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet. Michael D. Coe states that while \"it is incontrovertible that some of these victims ended up by being eaten ritually [\u2026], the practice was more like a form of communion than a cannibal feast\".[2]\n\n&gt; Documentation of Aztec cannibalism mainly dates from the period after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519-1521):\n\n&gt; In The Man-Eating Myth, Arens writes, \"The gradual transformation of what little evidence is available for Aztec cannibalism is also an indication of the continual need to legitimize the Conquest\".[3] The following claims could have been exaggerated.\n\n&gt; Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s wrote in one of his letters that a Spaniard saw an Indian...eating a piece of flesh taken from the body of an Indian who had been killed.[4]\n\n&gt;The Historia general (compiled 1540-1585) by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan (the first Mesoamerican ethnographer, according to Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla) contains an illustration of an Aztec being cooked by an unknown tribe. This was reported as one of the dangers that Aztec traders faced.\n\n&gt;In his book Relaci\u00f3n (1582), Juan Bautista de Pomar (c. 1535 \u2013 1590) states that after the sacrifice the body of the victim was given to the warrior responsible for the capture. He would boil the body and cut it to pieces to be offered as gifts to important people in exchange for presents and slaves. It was rarely eaten, since they considered it of no value. Bernal D\u00edaz reports that some of these parts of human flesh made their way to the Tlatelolco market near Tenochtitlan.\n\n&gt;In 2012 The National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH) reported that they have discovered around 60 skeletons under subway lines in Mexico City, 50 children, and 10 adults, dating back 500 years. The skeletons appear to have cut marks on the bones that indicated human sacrifice, but does not indicate that cannibalism had occurred.[5][6]\n\nSome authors have noted that Nahua writings of the period preceeding the Aztec conquest portray cannibalism as a taboo and suggested that the introduction of cannibalism into the historiography was either a racist concept that the Spanish basically just assumed would be apart of a native culture or deliberate. \n\n&gt; These three tales are practically the only form in which cannibalism appears in the major Nahua (indigenous Nahuatl-speaking) writings of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The stories portray cannibalism as shocking, even abhorrent, to Aztecs\u2014rather than as customary\u2014and as a stratagem for humiliating an enemy or provoking a community to war. The contemporaneous Spanish writings, in contrast, are replete with allegations of customary cannibalism, while the major mestizo (Nahua mother and Spanish father) authors are divided in their treatment of the subject. The three-way critical comparison (Nahua, mestizo, Spanish) raises the possibility that the idea of customary cannibalism originated in Spanish culture and was then transmitted to the indigenous population during post-Conquest religious conversion and Hispanicization.",

The spanish came along for conquest and enacted a system just as cruel and exploitative as the Aztecs. They established favorable conditions for the allies that helped them most, just as the Aztecs did for their most loyal tribes/city states. \n\nWhy do people insist that because people say that colonialism is wrong, that must mean they're claiming that native people are pure and noble and innocent?

There's a reason when the Spanish showed up they were able to get so much support from other natives to topple the Aztec empire.\n\nOverall my problem with this argument though is.....we have games where we play the Vikings, who were conquering invaders and slaughtered thousands of innocents. We have games where we play the Romans, who were a conquering force who subjugated thousands. We have games where we play the Egyptians who did the same. The Chinese, The English, etc.\n\nIdk why its suddenly a problem with this game, on either side of its conflict. Both sides sucked, but if we're going to take issue with evils of the past in terms of what side we play in a video game then we might as well put away the concept of ever making a game based on history ever again.

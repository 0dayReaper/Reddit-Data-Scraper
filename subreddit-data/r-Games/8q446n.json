                    "comment": "Full note reads (credit to /u/Sycon) \n\nIt's been over 2077 days since we announced our plan to develop Cyberpunk 2077. We released a CGI trailer, gave some interviews and... went dark. Normal procedure for these kinds of things - you announce a game and then shut up, roll up your sleeves, and go to work. We wanted to give you The Witcher 3 and both expansions first, which is why this period of staying silent was longer than we planned. Sorry for that.\n\nAs soon as we concluded work on Blood and Wine we were able to go full speed ahead with CP2077's pre-production. But we chose to remain silent. Why? At some point, we made a decision to resume talking about the game only when we have something to show. Something meaningful and substantial. This is because we do realise you've been (im)patiently waiting for a very long time, and we wouldn't want anyone to feel that we're taking this for granted. On the contrary - it gives us a lot of extra motivation. The hype is real, so the sweat and tears need to be real, too :).\n\nBut to the point. Today is the day. If you're seeing this, it means you saw the trailer - our vision of Cyberpunk, an alternative version of the future where America is in pieces, megacorporations control all aspects of civilised life, and gangs rule the rest. And, while this world is full of adrenaline, don't let the car chases and guns mislead you. Cyberpunk 2077 is a true single player, story-driven RPG. You'll be able to create your own character and..., well, you'll get to know the rest from what we show at our booth at E3. Be on the lookout for previews!\n\nBefore we finish, you probably have some questions, right?\n\nWhen? When we told you we would only release the game when it's ready, we meant it. We're definitely much, much closer to a release date than we were back then :), but it's still not the time to confirm anything, so patience is still required. Quality is the only thing that drives us - it's the beauty of being an independent studio and your own publisher.\n\nHow big? Seriously big, but..., to be honest, we have no bloody clue at this point in time. Once we put it all together, we will openly tell you what you can expect. And we promise we'll do this before we start talking about any pre-orders or ask anything of you.\n\nFree DLC/Expansions/DRM? Expect nothing less than you got with The Witcher 3. As for DRM, CP2077 will be 100% DRM-free on PC.\n\nMicrotransactions? In a single player role-playing game? Are you nuts?\n\nOnce again, thank you for your patience. If you have a minute, do visit cyberpunk.net and share your opinion (about anything) with us. We read everything you post and we treat it very seriously.\n\nYours, CD PROJEKT RED Team",

I remember people being upset Breath of The Wild kept getting pushed back and it ended up being a landmark video game. Of course, Nintendo may well have had it as a console mover with the Switch, but God of War and Halo get similar treatment. Compare this with something like Destiny; a good game loved by many, but it felt like it could\u2019ve used more time in the oven. ",

It's very true though. Halo 2 ended a little rushed by Microsoft, but none of the other games felt rushed at all. Your millage may vary on if you enjoy them or not, but honestly they are all really polished games.",

If I recall correctly, it basically thanked me for supporting them and mentioned the hard work they put into the game and hope I enjoyed it, nothing more. It was so refreshing to see something so unnecessary, yet personal, inside the box in an era where you don't even get instruction booklets anymore. As a cyberpunk fan this trailer by this team has my hyped AF.",

They went to do the same thing for GTA IV, only they didn't like the content/quality for $60, so they released Lost and Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony - which are almost entirely new GTA games just in Liberty City instead of a new city. Rather than release two sizable games for $60, they rejected more profits and released it as normal priced DLC.\n\nHow nice of them. Now they can't stop making enough money from GTA:O to even bother making a similar expansion to GTA V or a standalone expansion like VC or San Andreas. Sad, really. But maybe they lost their heads. We'll see for Red Dead, but I'm not exactly hopeful.",

Mike Pondsmith being a consultant should really alleviate all concerns about the setting being untrue to source material. ",

The city looks outstanding though and is very cyberpunk. Can't say i'm a fan of that main character design though, it's super generic. I hope we can at least give him hair because shaved head tough guy is possibly my least favorite character type. \n\nIt is much more like the vibe I got from flipping through the Tabletop RPG rulebook though so it seems like they've decided to do a more faithful adaption of that setting. \n\nEdit: Going back through the trailer it looks like there still is flying cars and rain slicked streets, there's a shot at 1:11 that looks exactly like something out of the teaser. \n\nEdit 2: Apparently you can still create your own character based on the secret message. This alleviates my concerns about the appearance of the MC. I now have absolutely nothing bad to say about this trailer, shit looks lit. ",

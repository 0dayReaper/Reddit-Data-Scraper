The vault was designed to open 20 years after a nuclear war, and was among the seventeen known control vaults, meaning that it was used as a baseline to compare to experimental vaults. It is also mentioned in one of the alien captive recorded logs (no.13) recorded by Giles Wolstencroft, a Vault-Tec official who was abducted while inspecting the vault's construction site. In Fallout 4, the newsreader in the prologue mentions Vault 76 debuting in 2076 in honor of America's tercentenary when discussing Vault-Tec's plans to expand.",

Could be very interesting.\n\nAlternatively, if it's set later it could be centred on a Vault City-type deal with areas built using the GECK, given that this is an intact, control vault.\n\nEdit: In before it's a city-building game using the GECK",

There's a lot of missing history there that they could play with!\n\nEdit: it seems the BoS was possibly created around the events in 2077, so the game could deal with the early formation of a proto BoS.",

So yeah they shouldn't exist yet, hell a great number of tribes and raider groups won't exist yet. You will be one of the first vault dwellers on post war soil. It's a truly blank slate to mold. I 100% guarantee settlement building will be back and far bigger then before, rads will be harsher, but supplies and etc more plentiful. Creatures less grotesque and ghouls less prevelent.

FO4 has the settlement building as their main mechanic, using that idea and with the vault being 76, and the big poster there writing \"Celebrate Reclamation Day\", it's gonna be a settlement building game. Couple with what Kotaku's Jason said, it's gonna be an online game.\n\nWhich kinda makes it being a settlement building game with online functionality, probably also merging the idea from Shelter and vault building DLC from FO4.",

In the original games there was a distinct difference between the lived-in cities and the unpopulated ruins.\n\nThen you get Fallout 3, where there are people who are literally living and sleeping in rooms where there's been a skeleton lying in the corner for generations, and no one has ever considered maybe cleaning it up.\n\nWhich is my big problem with the Bethesda Fallout games. They're fun theme parks to tromp around in, but they make no sense as a world. It's like they took a cursory glance at the first game and decided to copy what they saw with no understanding of the world-building behind it. By the time Fallout 3 takes place, society should be well into rebuilding, not a handful of shanty-towns still somehow living off scraps from 200 years ago.",

Hence all the trash lying around, wooden structures still totally intact with no problems, full functional robots that should've run out of fuel 198 years ago, basically **NO** restructuring or rebuilding of society whatsoever, etc.\n\nFallout 1 and 2 have full proper cities with entirely new structures built in them, and they're set like 80 years after the bombs. Fallout 3, NV, and 4 are set 200 years after and the best people have managed is to put some metal they found up against some other metal they found. A confusing design decision made worse in Fallout 4 where your player character with no formal training can build entire generators to create infinite clean water (which the entire plot of Fallout 3 was centered around achieving).\n\nI'm not sure if they'll even do *anything* to differentiate the way the outside world looks \"30 years after the bombs\" considering the game already looks like it hasn't even been that long...\n\nIf we're lucky, this is the \"green grass and leafy trees\" apocalypse the series should've had from the outset.",

People often talked about pre-war things as if they were in living memory, and the destruction also seemed relatively recent. The ruins definitely did not look like 200 years have passed, for example.\n\nThat was an often repeated criticism of the games, and for me personally it was making suspension of disbelief difficult. I am glad they took it to heart for the next game. ",

It was one of those kind of weird and nonsensical decisions that was made purely for asesthetics. \n\nBoston, DC, they should be overgrown with greenery after the bombs, and likely filled with all sorts of animal life. But that'd look kind of strange to our unthinking assumptions about life post bomb.",

Blizzard would have been insane to make Warcraft 4 when the RTS genre was declining and WoW was the biggest game *of all time*. \n\nESO might be successful, but the single player franchise for Elder Scrolls is still their flagship. Skyrim is still purchased in droves and the genre ia incredibly popular.\n\nThing is, doing a game like Elder Scrolls is expensive and time consuming.",

This was more evident in Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas. \n\nSo overall, I think it can be done, you can have a game take place 50 years after the latest game and still have great storylines of communities getting back on their feet.

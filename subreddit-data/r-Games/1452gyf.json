Everyone else have integral roles at their game studios and are obligated to be the public face for their games. The writer argues for the featuring of other developers despite this, which I think would be irresponsible given the sheer amount of internet shrapnel you can catch just by putting your name and face on a game. \n\nThe concern should be if game dev leadership at large studios is too male-dominated. The writer is correct in the observation that smaller presentations, especially indies like Day of the Devs and Wholesome Direct tend to have more female presenters. \n\nBut even then, larger shows like SGF don\u2019t feature very many people at all (I\u2019d argue they should be rid off entirely since the interviews kill the show\u2019s pacing). Keighley is obligated to stuff as many trailers and ads as possible into the 2-hour timeframe. It wouldn\u2019t be \u201cone of the biggest game events of the year\u201d if he inserted more interviews, diverse or otherwise.",

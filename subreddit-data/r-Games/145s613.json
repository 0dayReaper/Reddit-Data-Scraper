    "postText": "# **r/Games and the June 12-14 shutdown**\n\nHello, r/games community. By now, we're sure you've heard of the [impending changes to API usage that threatens the viability of many third-party Reddit add-ons](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/). This is something we take seriously. Third party apps like Apollo and Reddit is Fun didn't just provide a more personalized, enjoyable browsing experience for Redditors; they also provided an increased level of accessibility for disabled users. Killing off those apps meant removing an avenue of access for our fellow Redditors. From a moderation perspective, a lack of API access also hurts us - [r/askhistorians goes over this in a bit more detail](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/).\n\nHowever, the general consensus within the mod team is that we will not be enacting a blackout come June 12. This is due to multiple reasons:\n\n- Historically r/games tries to distance itself from meta incidents spanning the entire site. This is a policy we've enacted over the years, and (at least in terms of a site-wide blackout) it'll continue in the meantime.\n\n- While the intentions of this blackout are noble, it also clashes with certain video game presentations (namely, the Ubisoft and Capcom events), and therefore our primary goal: To provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussion. A blackout would therefore, be at odds with the primary mission of this subreddit. The fact that this blackout would affect some community members (fans of Ubisoft and Capcom properties) far more than others exacerbates this problem.\n\n- Lastly, several team members don't believe that a blackout (especially over 2 days) will result in any meaningful impact. Previous blackouts resulted in at most, temporary gains which quickly reverted back to Reddit's typical malevolent apathy. \n\nHaving said that, this does not mean r/games will not be showing support for the blackout. Instead of shutting down, r/games will enter a 'restricted mode' starting June 12, and stay in this mode for the duration of the shutdown. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# **Restricted Mode &amp; What It Entails**\n\nYou might be wondering what restricted mode means. This simply means that:\n\n- Comments from new accounts or users with low karma specific to r/games will be autoremoved by Automod across all posts.\n\n- Every submission will have a sticky to raise awareness about the ongoing shutdown.\n\n- A permanent announcement will be pinned at the top of the sub throughout the duration of the shutdown.\n\nNone of us are happy with the current direction of Reddit. Despite not fully shutting down r/games, restricted mode allows us to disrupt its growth (and in some small part, Reddit as a whole). It also allows us to express our discontent with Reddit's recent decisions without disrupting the existing r/games community, and also accounts for a possible influx in user interaction from elsewhere.\n\nWe'd like to note however, that while our current stance for June 12-14 is locked in, what happens after that **may change, should the situation develop further**. The option of an indefinite blackout is still on the table, and may be employed should the situation deteriorate further. Due to the severity of this situation, we'd like to assess what happens, before making a decision that impacts the community in the long term.\n\nThis thread will be left open to allow discussion. However, please note that subreddit rules still apply, and rule-breaking comments will still be actioned. Please remember to be respectful to your fellow Redditor, regardless of disagreements.",

Either fully boycott a service indefinitely until the change you want happens or shut up.",

We know Ubisoft and Capcom have events. You can pretty much just head to any gaming site for a couple days or just go direct to the source on YouTube. This sub may be people's preferred medium but it's not like it's going to have information you can't find just as easily with the smallest bit of effort. \n\nThere just isn't an absolute need for /r/gaming to stay active just so people can circlejerk about how much they love/hate AC games or how excited they are for Dragon's Dogma  2. Most people can predict 95% of what the standard commentary will be without even needing to read it because it's almost always the same opinions regurgitated without much room for alternate ideas or discussion.\n\nHonestly, the break between gaming announcements or events is such that there's less time in a year where nothing is going on than there is something going on. It's just not really a great excuse. If the mods of this sub really don't believe in the blackout then they shouldn't even bother with the half-measures. Anyone who truly believes in the blackout shouldn't be using Reddit during that time anyways. It's kind of pointless if you just come comment here because everything else is closed.",

It's incredibly presumptive for a couple mods of a 3million person subreddit to come and say \"we don't think it'll matter\" when sitewide dozens of subreddits of various size are participating.  You are moderators, not leaders of the community.  You should give the people what they want, within reason, and this is certainly reasonable.\n\n\"This is something we take seriously\" is more or less a bold-faced lie, because actions speak louder than words and this decision speaks clearly.",

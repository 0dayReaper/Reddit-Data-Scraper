It\u2019s also in direct opposition to what I personally grew to believe a while back -- that crunch should never be the answer. But we\u2019ve extended all other possible means of navigating the situation.\u201d\n\nWhat about delaying the game again? I wouldn't mind. The game will still sell bonkers anyway.",

As long as there are a hundred developers willing to apply to CDPR for every one who quits because of crunch or burnout, they'll continue to crunch because there's no (profit-affecting) reason not to.",

There is loads of well-documented research showing just how drastically productivity declines when days stretch that long. Here is one from Stanford: http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf, which found that workers that work 70 hours per week accomplish the same amount as those who work 55 hour weeks. It is literally pointless.\n\nThe human brain has a cap on how much it can output before it needs to rest. If the task at hand requires *any* level of mental effort (and software dev tops the charts in terms of mental effort required), continuing to work past this point is likely just going to actively harm your project. People will be so exhausted that they are more likely to add new bugs into the game while trying to fix old ones.\n\nBy forcing people to work this much you are accomplishing nothing other than killing employee morale. This research is so widely and publicly available that it floors me that studios continue forcing it into their working culture. *Happy employees make better products.*",

Back on BF1942, I was working nearly 100 hours a week for the last couple of weeks prior to it going gold.\n\nHowever!\n\nThis isn't 100 hours a week of working. It was more like being on call in person. I would do my part and hand it off. Then once I'm done with it I'm sitting idle, including even taking naps, or playing a random video game or whatnot.\n\nThen once someone needed me I needed to be willing to drop my idle activity and quickly do the work asked of me. I finish that, then hand it off, and back to naptime.\n\nThis drastically shortened the feedback loop when everyone was in the office, immediately reachable, and eager to finish their bit and hand it off.\n\nIn other words, I was being paid to hurry up and wait. And they paid ridiculous overtime. I hit quadruple time at one point. The paychecks were enormous.\n\nThen afterwards we had a month long cooling off session. Full pay, zero work for an entire month. Paid to show up at the office and have a month long LAN party with free food and drinks.",

I gotta say this is way off from my experience.\n\nAs an artist, crunch means working that whole time. You might get blocked, but if you're in crunch you have so many tasks that you keep crunching on another task.\n\nThere's no OT pay when you're salary and I don't know anyone who is full time who gets paid hourly. It's literally just having your life overtaken by work because of poor planning. You'll get free pizza and Jimmy John's, but you're in the office for 10 hours, and you're working when you get home too. Weekends are gone, your burnt out, and you're just trying to get through it as best you can and hoping the next deliverable will be better planned even though you know that's not going to happen. You might get a free week off at the end of that. I got a $2k bonus once and a week off after crunch, because my lead quit during the crunch and they were terrified the rest of the environment team would quit too. But that was once out of multiple occasions at the same company - a company that was \"adamently against crunch culture,\" as they put it. \n\nWhen you interview people, they ask about company culture, but what every wants to know is \"how often do you guys crunch, and how bad is it?\"\n\nIts a massive problem and in my experience, you got it way easier than most, fortunately.",

That happened too.\n\nAfter the game was released, after we worked on some patches and some work for the expansion pack, most of us were laid off. Including myself.\n\nThats the inherent thing with project work. You're hired to do a project. You complete the project, and once done you need to go find a new project.\n\nThe size of a game studio varies wildly based on what phase of game development they're on. They don't need to be full staffed at all phases of development. There's always going to be lean times between projects, when the next game is still in the concept art stage.",

Working oil fields is another kind of season work where people work ridiculous hours for a couple months a year, and thats it. Thats the entire job. When they're working its 24/7 with zero downtime, but people earn an entire year of pay in only a month or two.\n\nIts certainly not the kind of work for everyone.

Longest stretch of crunch I think I experienced was 7 or 8 months straight - finaled one project and then immediately got put in 2 more projects in final back to back.  \n\nCrunch was actually scheduled as soon as alpha hit.  Standard crunch time was 9am-10pm 5 days a week, one \u201chalf day\u201d (meaning a standard 8 hour work day) and one day off.  When things got down to the wire, it was 7 days a week - sometimes with split shifts rotating to get 24 hour coverage.\n\nI could only really endure about 3 years of that.  I hope it\u2019s gotten a bit better in the last 20 years, but it doesn\u2019t really sound like it...",

People can work longer hours in short bursts while maintaining productivity, as long as it's not routine and they get time to recover. The more intensive the crunch, the less time you can maintain that crunch for, and the more time you will need to recover afterwards.",

In this case, delaying the game would just add room for more \"stuff.\" Polishing and bug fixing are part of that, both because they are part and parcel to scope, but also because they are intrinsically proportional to complexity. \n\nIt takes an almost superhuman level of discipline and practice to prevent more stuff from being added to the project if there is room for it. In over 10 years of professional software development working with dozens of companies, I've never yet seen anything close to it, and no one I've ever talked to has ever seen it. Only on the very smallest projects with an extremely narrow scope and a very small number of people (under 5) working on them have I seen anything like ability to actually \"finish\" something on time and/or on budget. It just never happens.",

The game will still sell bonkers anyway.\n\nI believe that at a certain point \"running out of money\" is an issue.\nBasically what \"last leg crunch\" is doing is trying to have the \"having to pay for that crunch\" falls into \"we have released the game\" portion.\nCompared with NOT crunching and running into the next wage payout without the boost in sales, then finishing it and releasing and paying only THAT month out of the earnings.\n\nThen there are other things that are running in the background. The PR push that costs money and is prearranged and maybe costly to postpone/get out of. (events, bought ad space for instance)\nMaybe pressure to not collide with or pre-empt someone else's release. So if you are running on fumes, getting \"a bunch of money\" to eat that cost NOW even though a proper payout is obviously imminent isn't always an attractive option (or not at all). Or at least not compared with \"taking credit in worktime from your employees\".\n\nSo there are quite a number of reasons why despite \"suboptimal planning\" (which is what \"not hitting the date as planned without change\" means, without trying to sound glib or dismissive) you would decide to value hitting the date other than just \"ego\".\n\nThe issue isn't that crunch \"might happen when things REALLY don't go well and you can't eat all the costs of postponing well\".\nThe issue starts when it becomes the norm and extending further and further back till it gets part of the general planning.\nOr even worse if the industry keeps putting people who LOVE crunch as a matter of philosophy are seen as \"proper leaders\".\n\nLike there are legitimately a lot of folks that \"run\" on procrastination and crunching at the end. You know them from school/college. Some smaller entities can organise themselves to only be comprised of likeminded people and that works, too.\n\nWhat doesn't work is if the majority of employers for certain jobs confuses poor planning with \"how this industry HAS to be\".",

It's selfish and immoral to dismiss the hard work going into these experiences, peoples' families can get torn apart by this behaviour and it's terrible to see it happening over and over again. So what if Cyberpunk 2077 comes out and is great, will it all have been worth it? I'm not buying this game first-hand, I'll wait and get it from someone else because I have no interest in supporting a development team that tries to justify such bullshit behaviour.\n\nAnyone here to defend this practise is a legitimate shill for bad management just because you get a shiny toy at the end, you need to grow up.",

Now with an additional 9 months of work, they still need to crunch in the end?\n\nI'm all for extending the release date if they want to avoid crunch, but that just seems like it would push the crunch back however many months they push the release date back. It seems like they need managers who are better at limiting expectations and honing the scope of their part, rather than promising the sky and expecting their team to deliver it within an impossible timeframe.",

They're working overtime (doubles, and even sleeping in the office). I remember when Assassin's Creed Unity came out and it was an article that stated how it was people working in the day then people working in the night nonstop for months on end to finish the game. It's a bad part of the industry that can only be fixed if they unionize.\n\nUnfortunately, people also pick and choose what developers they defend when it comes to crunch ignoring that all companies have crunch.

My point was more that it's a lot more eye opening to \"see it for myself\" when looking into things over just hearing about it.",

Its like, ok, avoid Nestle for sure, that's an easy one, but shit they own like 25% of all food companies! Sometimes you'll buy something for years without knowing its parent company is evil, or the big evil will buy out your favorite smaller brand/item and thus ruin for you. And this is just for food shit. Everything we consume is tainted by this problem of evil. It sucks. I'd rather forage and hunt for food at this point, but my wife has a higher standard of living than me haha.",

If a game's sales drop, such is the nature of capitalist corporate culture that the management response will 100% be \"Well, we just need to crunch harder!\" And if they lose money from a sales dip, the first thing they will do is cut staff.\n\nThe idea of the perpetrators of this practice suddenly realising that they were wrong and deciding to change their wicked ways all by themselves is nothing more than a fantasy. They're never going to change, they need to be aggressively fought, every step of the way. For gods sake, the Belgian government literally made EA's loot boxes illegal, and they *still* tried to fight it. Developers need to properly unionise, and that is the only solution.",

They crunched really hard for their previous games, and all of a sudden just became you got a good value (Witcher 3 and the DLCs) for a bargain price they're ethical? You're just enjoying the benefits of cheap labor. Poland is still recovering from decades of communist rule and people there are relatively poor. They can extract more value out of their workers for the same $60 people pay for games made in rich countries.",

Never whaled, but the the time and headspace I spent on the F2P grind made me miss out on a lot of important things in my life.  After about a month, the only way to progress meaningfully is to gamble on summons and, hilariously, to download an android emulator and use macros to run characters you don't even use through the first level hundreds of thousands of times.  God, I fucking hate Skinnerware.   The people who make these games are criminals.",

Bet it'd do pretty well.\n\nI'm not hostile toward Remake, but at the end of the day I think what I really wanted was the ability to replay FF7 with a slightly less quaint aesthetic.\n\nI just wish this energy had gone there instead of a mobile gacha game.",

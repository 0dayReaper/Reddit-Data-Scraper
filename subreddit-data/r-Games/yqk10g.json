I'm honestly impressed how much Mick was willing to go through, even to the point where he offered to work on the OST if Marty took responsiblity, which still he refused to do.\n\nHe never mentions it in this blog but this means Mick Gordon is going to sue, right?",

Yeah the fan mixes on YouTube are nice, but they're definitely compressed since they're made using music stems saved in the game files, and they're just not up to the level of mastering quality that you get from a guy like Mick. They also routinely get taken down and re-uploaded so they're inconsistent.\n\nI'm happy to pay for an Eternal OST, but just because one executive producer has a small ego and a tiny dick the fans are the ones that truly lose out. I never trusted that open letter that he posted, Mick has had an incredible career up until Eternal so for them to accuse him of being some type of stereotypical drama queen of a composer is the height of insult. Fuck Marty Stratton.",

Betting that he doesnt have the money for a long, lengthy court battle. While also essentially hoping there is not enough evidence for a court judge to believe Mick was swindled. So he's publishing this article to try &amp; sway public opinion. And I don't blame him. \n\nThey completely fucked him over. Then shifted the blame of the poor reception onto him. This probably actually really did effect his personal/career standing in the industry. I think ID know how much they fucked up. How much he's loved/respected from their fans &amp; other musicians. Theres a reason they offered him ~~$600k~~ 6-figures (my b mis-read) to stay quite. Im willing to bet they are worried other artist wont want to work with them after this story gets out. \n\nEdit: Typos* Plus finished the *entire* thing. This letter really comes off like he's been in talks with them to get the rights/money back but its not going well. My guess is he also wants them to issue a statement fully absolving him. Which it sounds like they won't do. So he just said **fuck it** &amp; published this with the help of lawyers so as to not incriminate himself or others.\n\nEdit2: **You know what. This is super fucked.** Marty had the balls to put in that OST post:\n\n\n&gt;He\u2019s deserved every award won, and I hope his incredible score for DOOM Eternal is met with similar accolades \u2013 he will deserve them all. \n\nYet Marty has appearntly since kept **many** of the musical awards the game received. Even accepting them himself. All the while Mick hasn't even been sent a copy of a single one. \n\n**What. The. Fuck.** No wonder Bethesda/ID don't want this story out. They look awful to work with right now.\n\nFinal Edit: u/DaHolk made a really good point. Assuming I understand them correctly. If Marty/ID had been planning to use their Lead Audio Designer from the get go as the files Mick is producing show. Then it's likely theres a case to made that **ALL** owners of the Collectors Edition were also victim of a sort of fraud as they were mislead into buying an incomplete/inferior product than they were promised. One Marty/ID new they'd never deliver on.\n\nThat seems super damaging to the company. Like finacially and reputation wise. It would also likely explain why A. they refuse to accept fault or throw Marty under the bus yet, &amp; B. Would explain why they were so eager to spend 6-figures to shut Mick up. As a new OST or civil(?) lawsuit would probably cost millions, no?",

You need some less ambitious milestones for payment early in the process.

But with this post, the gag order is useless. So it's just putting a $ amount on ego now. The unpaid work is a slam dunk in court, it'll just take a long time and cost both sides more time and effort than it's worth.",

It was only after Mick went above his head that that changed.\n\nRegardless of what happened between the two, at the very least every collectors edition buyer could have a claim that from the start ID intentionally was defrauding them with NO intention to actually provide the product promised.\nBasically Mick would have been in a better position of he had not agreed to the OST contract at all.\n\nAnd it's not the first time that \"promises for collectors editions\" to an unimaginable extent deviate between delivery and promise at Zenimax.

The kicker is how much Marty appearntly 'begged' for \"extra tracks for a bonus payout\".\n\nYeah it really looks like Marty expected to get away with fraud on both ends.

This looks like an easy defamation case to prove. Same thing with the contract\u2014whether he got paid for half the songs and whether those songs were used will not be in dispute. A judge will just look within the four corners of the contract and determine whether id breached it. \n\nI hope Mick does sue. Maybe he can get a firm to take his case on a contingency fee, or maybe he already has. Releasing a statement like this before filing a lawsuit seems very unusual to me, but I\u2019m also fairly certain it was written with the help of a lawyer.

            "comment": "[TL;DR from the linked article](https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce#6fef) I tried to format it similarly to how Mick did in the article.\n\n#**Summary of Facts**\n##**DOOM Eternal**\n**I haven\u2019t been paid for over half of DOOM Eternal\u2019s music**: The game includes more than double the music I was contracted to produce. Rejects, mockups, demos, many of which were never meant for public release. I created this music as part of the development process and shared it with id Software in good faith. But id Software used the music in the game, marketing and soundtrack and still refuses to pay me for it.\n\n##**The DOOM Eternal OST was a mess**\nIt was announced, with my name attached, and made available for pre-order **before I was contracted to produce it**. Despite my alarm and constant appeals Marty refused to do anything about the situation, leading to a nine-month delay before I could start work.\n\n* After seven months of inaction, I reported my concerns to Bethesda.\n* Bethesda and I negotiated the DOOM Eternal OST directly, without Marty\u2019s involvement.\n* I received the contract on March 18, 2020, just 48 hours before DOOM Eternal was released. The delay was announced a week earlier before I was under contract.\n\nThe deadline was April 16 (29 days later) and the contract stipulated id Software had complete creative control and would aquire access to all my source material.\n\n**Marty withheld crucial details from me** until 13 days before my deadline, such as:\n\n* Potential legal trouble they faced for taking pre-orders before it was under contract.\n* Details about their internally-produced OST: an alternative edited from my in-game score, which they\u2019d worked on for at least six months without my knowledge or involvement.\n\n**I didn\u2019t approve the release**: In the days leading up to April 16, Marty cut me out of the process and decided to release their alternative version instead, reducing my direct contributions to filler. Both he, and id Software\u2019s Lead Audio Designer, Chad Mossholder, didn\u2019t allow me to hear the final album and didn\u2019t seek my approval; they weren\u2019t contractually required to do so.\n\n##**OST release**\n**Their poor-quality release** immediately drew criticism, and a worried Marty personally asked me for assistance in addressing the situation. I made myself entirely available to Marty and committed to satisfying disappointed customers with a better OST. Marty made it clear he wanted me involved, saying he wanted a positive outcome, had no ill intentions and wanted to resolve the issue professionally.\n\n* He offered to draft a joint statement addressing the situation and announcing plans to move forward.\n* He requested I hold off on making further public comments until we could address the public together.\n\nMarty told me to expect the draft within hours, but it never arrived.\n\n##**Reddit**\n**Instead**, days later, he published a 2500+ word \u201copen letter\u201d on a fan-run Reddit page that singled me out as the sole cause behind the botched OST. The post attracted thousands of comments and news articles and severely damaged my personal and professional reputation. Worst of all, he did it behind my back whilst leading me on with a bullshit story about working together on a professional solution to the problem.\n\n**His statement was full of lies, disinformation and innuendo**, and when challenged, his company offered me a six-figure sum to shut up about it. When I tried, time and time again, amid a torrent of abuse, harassment and threats, to resolve the matter more amicably, he constantly refused, worried how addressing the Reddit post would damage his own reputation instead.\n\n**But as far as I\u2019m concerned, truth and honesty are more important**: Marty\u2019s words damaged my character and attacked my reputation. I have afforded him ample opportunity to address this issue, but his refusal to do so has left me with no option other than to issue this statement.",

This is about 2.5 years ago. During this time Mick constantly tried to reach for Marty/Id/Bethesda to do the right thing. All that happened is in two different instance the lawyers of Marty's side just played a never-ending waiting game.\n\n2) Mick spent the last 2.5 year trying to reach for an agreement with Marty/Id/Bethesda. Nothing fruitful came out of it, his opponent just won't budge.\n\n3) Of course he'd hire a lawyer even if its just for this text. You think Marty and co would let this slide after spending so much in attempting to get him to take the blame?

It reads like Id fucking swindled this guy?!?\n\n\n&gt;It wasn\u2019t until after DOOM Eternal was released that I became aware id Software had used nearly all the music I produced throughout development \u2014 almost five hours worth \u2014 while only paying for half of it.\n\n&gt;Isolated from the team, working on the other side of the planet, I had no control over how they used the music: music placement was the Lead Audio Designer\u2019s responsibility, and after I handed the files over, they decided how to use them.\n\n&gt;Using double what they paid for wasn\u2019t an accident; it was a conscious decision.\n\n&gt;Rejected tracks, mockups, demos, ideas and sketches \u2014 a massive amount of additional music, well beyond the budget allocated in the contract, produced at their request and shared in good faith. But, id Software included it all directly in-game, marketing, and updates without paying for it.\n\n&gt;Even worse,\u00a0id Software still refuses to pay for it, despite the fact their contract guarantees payment for any additional minute requested beyond the original budget.\n\nEDIT: Just finished reading the whole thing and it's stomach churning what he's saying they've done. I hope this gets all the press it deserves because they straight up extorted work from Mick and then tried to threaten and use their financial/legal muscle to suppress the fallout. I'm amazed that this even transpired.",

If you're a contractor in the U.S, roughly 1/3 of your income should immediately get set aside for taxes. Not sure how it is in Australia, but I'd imagine it's probably about the same. We're probably talking a six-figure sum. \n\nStill, compared to their revenue and the potential damage to their brand, that six figure sum is just a drop in the bucket. Not to mention that they've lost the composer that helped build the Doom reboot's identity. I don't see Mick working with id again as long as Marty Stratton is involved (and it sounds like Mick doesn't either).",

I hope any composers reading this article can learn to lock down their contracts better... \n\nI never believed the reddit post because I've watched and listened mick talk about making music for killer instinct and the first doom. He's a perfectionist and someone who goes above and beyond to deliver. It literal shows when he worked for almost a year unpaid to deliver something fans would want. It's so sad he was harassed for something obviously outside of his control. I guess that's where the FAN in FANATIC comes into play.\n\nEdit: changed some wording to clarify he isn't being compensated for half the music he created but is being used in game after the tracks were \"rejected\"",

I had written the whole situation off as just some people not working well together but here we are and there's quite a lot in the article listing what appears to be evidence that Mick had been thoroughly screwed over throughout the development of the game and its soundtrack. I'm anxiously awaiting a proper conclusion to this because I'd really like to believe that whenever people are truly, unjustly treated and not properly compensated for their work, they should get what they deserve in the end.\n\nIt's an interesting contrast to how Helena Taylor handled her Bayonetta 3 \"dispute\" by making a few very short, very emotional videos without providing any sort of corroborating evidence to prove her point, meaning that journalists had to go digging for it in the weeks following her allegations. Mick has really built up a case here, and regardless of how accurate it is I'm much more inclined to believe people who are able to take their time and present a carefully-worded and thoroughly researched statement.\n\nGenuinely curious what, if anything, Bethesda/Id would have to say about this, given the initial statement they made years ago. I have a hard time believing that any of them were actively malicious against Mick but it would not surprise me if at least the parts about unrealistic goals and deadlines were accurate even still.\n\nEDIT: Except Marty might have been malicious, perhaps. The article really makes him out to not only disagree with Mick about core facts of the events presented but never listening to any of his concerns, making bizarre last-minute demands, etc. I'm a lot less inclined to believe the words of Marty two years ago with this post here, and there needs to be a proper clarification and conclusion soon. He really makes the man out like he's nearly insane.",

If even half of what Mick says is true this clown shouldn't be allowed to manage at a fucking McDonalds let alone Id. I encourage you to read it if you haven't - he is GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. No wonder he laid so much blame on Mick in his original post. He is deflecting to  not expose his own ineptitude. \n\nIt does baffle me that Mick kept giving Id the benefit of the doubt. When they announced the OST he hadn't even agreed to make he should have had alot of negotiating power. He didn't have to make that OST and they would have been in a world of shit if he decided not to being that they already announced it and took preorders. Why not demand the money you were already owed before even agreeing to a new OST contract?\n\nI am sure Mick went along with their crap because he values a good product and pleasing the fans above all else. Regardless, what a fucking shitshow. \n\nDoom Eternal is one of my favorite games of all time. But I don't think anything is worth the hell ID management put their workers through. I am sure this is just one of many stories of their inability to treat their employees/contractors like humans.",

The delay was announced a week earlier before I was under contract.\n\n-\n&gt; I haven\u2019t been paid for over half of DOOM Eternal\u2019s music: The game includes more than double the music I was contracted to produce. Rejects, mockups, demos, many of which were never meant for public release. I created this music as part of the development process and shared it with id Software in good faith. But id Software used the music in the game, marketing and soundtrack and still refuses to pay me for it.\n\n-\n&gt; His statement was full of lies, disinformation and innuendo, and when challenged, his company offered me a six-figure sum to shut up about it. When I tried, time and time again, amid a torrent of abuse, harassment and threats, to resolve the matter more amicably, he constantly refused, worried how addressing the Reddit post would damage his own reputation instead.",

I didn't get this, as I'm not familiar enough with it, but apparently it's genuinely some default Unity font, potentially? Either way, I saw the save menu and was like \"why do the names of the save slots look so cheap\". Then I realised it was because it's a generic and boring font, not something stylised as you'd expect from a menu you see hundreds of times.",

Had to use a downgrader mod to bring back the PC version.\n\nThis trilogy remaster is all 3 games ported to the Unreal Engine using some shitty tools they made that screwed up a lot of the game and broke the character models and lighting in quite a lot of areas. The map also has some issues with holes in the geometry as a result of this port.",

When you've got a property as popular as GTA, a competent remaster may as well be printing free money with the amount of dough it would rake in. Really just no excuse, especially when you're a company as large as Take Two is.",

They took the route of cheapest possible production regardless of eventual quality, knowing they wouldn't need quality to make sales, the nostalgia around the titles would do it alone. Then they pulled the originals off the shelves, and forced a review embargo pass the release date, to ensure they'd ensnare enough preorders and early buyers to at least break even and earn a little extra after having spent pennies. And of course because the originals can't be bought anymore, it ensures these cheaply produced games will be a steady income source anytime someone feels like revisiting the games and isn't aware of how bad the remasters were. They underestimated just how bad the kickback would be, but the sad truth is it will die down, and every day some new schmuck will stumble into the store and buy it.\n\nThey could have done something incredible, but instead they relied on gamers being mindless consumers, which is a safe enough bet. Also that they'd play enough that they couldn't get a refund, also a decent bet. It's a strategy a lot of shitty developers go with now.",

If a company does something that results in negative reviews, *and you don't care about it*, then just buy the game regardless!

People are attributing too much to AI upscaling (seriously it does not work like half the commenters here think it does) and \"laziness/incompetence\" and not enough to just a poor development environment.\n\nThe (now infamous) misspellings on the Vice City storefronts aren't from a dev using AI upscaling. It's from an Artist having to complete and implement thirty textures in an hour. The rain is bugged, but the decision was likely  \"fix the rain or fix this game breaking crash in the art pipeline.\"\n\nEvery issue I can find in the trilogy can be attributed to just the developers being under an insane amount of crunch, and having no weight at all to argue for a release delay. People say they had two years - yes, they did. It's still a ludicrous amount of work to do in that time.\n\nMy hope is Rockstar gave them a decent post-release support budget to finish it up, because if not they're going to be shit on by fans who don't understand anything about development, and forever tarnished by it. It'll kill the studio.\n\nFast, Good, Cheap. You can only pick two, and T2/R\\* picked Fast and Cheap.",

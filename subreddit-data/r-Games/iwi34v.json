    "postText": "Among Us has just reached 388k players on steam. While the game has been rapidly growing over the past month, the reason this milestone is significant is because this is the first ever time the game has beat the daily peak player count of PUBG and has taken the #3 spot on steam. The game is only behind CS:GO and Dota 2 at the moment. While PUBG, at one point, would peak at 3.2m players daily and held the #1 for a full year, the game has now lost nearly 90% of its player base due to the lack of content updates and frequent game breaking bugs.\n\nWhile there have been other games which have had player counts this high for a while (i.e. GTA5, Fallout 4), what makes this so impressive is that the was made by small indie development with just 3 developers. For the majority of the development lifecycle, it was just 1 developer working on it.\n\nPlease note this 388k is only on steam, there are probably even more on mobile since the game is free to play on there.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://steamcharts.com/app/945360](https://steamcharts.com/app/945360)\n\n[http://www.innersloth.com/About.php](http://www.innersloth.com/About.php)",

I haven't heard of it until in recent months and began playing it.\n\nI was skeptical about it but its actually pretty fun with a group of friends, especially since it has a low barrier of entry and it isn't a big time commitment.",

You need to have a really good feel for how people will vote, but it's incredibly rewarding to pull off. Basically saving their ass by accusing them. \n\nKind of needs to be late enough that you can finish the game in the next round though.",

A great strategy for a game with friends, but more trouble in a random game. \n\nThere\u2019s a game popular in Michigan (and likely elsewhere, but my understanding is it\u2019s not consistent) called Euchre, and it\u2019s two teams of two, and if you have a strong enough hand you can \u201cgo alone\u201d for the hand, which has the potential to earn more points for your team.

Then there\u2019s independent units like a serial killer, who are much stronger at night but obviously working on their own. It makes the gameplay more dynamic but it evens out the skill floor since you don\u2019t exactly need to report a dead body, you just count the dead in the morning. Also people have wills, so once they\u2019re dead you can read any notes they left behind",

So even more reason to play it. Oh, and unlike those other games, you being killed doesn't just take you out of the game, you still have objectives you can complete. Project Winter and TTT both have that issue of being killed essentially being a  \"sit out and watch your friends play\" event, which seriously kills any enjoyment that can be had for people that end up like that. \n\nIs Town of Salem an active betrayal game like TTT or Among Us? Last time I played like 3 years ago it was an interesting, albeit ugly upgraded forum game where people discussed, the night happened, events happened, and then people discussed again. Was extremely boring in the way that it felt like I just kinda sat there waiting for people to play, instead of having gameplay to experience.",

A lot of social deduction games go overboard on roles, which makes it much harder to play, especially for new players. It also tends to actually reduce the amount of strategy, because introducing more variables makes player actions much harder predict using basic game theory. And IMO, most of Salem's roles don't even add much to the game, it's just content for the sake of content. \n\nOn top of that, Town of Salem is essentially a pure chatroom game, with no game mechanics besides talking, voting, and using your role's action. The graphics aren't meaningful, it doesn't have a world to interact with, and it doesn't really take advantage of the digital medium. I also think the theme is much less compelling than TTT or Among Us. \n\nTTT and Among Us both give you a world to walk around, which creates a lot more room for roleplaying, tactics, and player skill. TTT has the basic gun duel mechanics of Counter-Strike, which can add an additional element of fun and unpredictability, but could also turn-off some players if they make correct deductions but keep getting gunned-down by a bunnyhopping terrorist with pro aim skills. The really clever thing about Among Us is the mundane tasks it gives players. It gives the players a reason to go off alone, and can help generate those fun murder mystery scenarios where you're trying to solve the murder by piecing together locations, visibility, timelines, etc. \n\nProject Winter is similar, but I think it has a few too many other game mechanics going on. The design of Among Us is really strong because the basics are simple enough that you can understand the basics on your first or second play-through.",

Also, the whole \"voting people to death\" think kills multiplayer games super fast. You can't vote people out of the game in PW so if you're a traitor and get sussed out you can keep playing. Same for survivors if your fellow survivors turn on you.\n\nAlso, it's a lot easier for a traitor to fuck up a kill in that game. Unlike Among Us where you just click a button. That alone massively enhances the game.",

My issue with every game I've played is that everyone seems to vote blindly, and if you even attempt to discuss via chat you just get randomly voted off as being suspect. It feels like a very watered down version of Town of Salem, which I enjoy a lot.\n\nMight have to do with it being overly populated with no skill-based matching. No idea.",

That's where the real fun is. I know not everyone has that, but if you're really interested I'm pretty sure the discord is very highly populated, and maybe some other online forums you can find players to play with.\n\nI also find myself getting into groups of 10 just because the sheer popularity of the game makes it so that we have kind of a web of friends groups playing with each other. If all of us who play find another person or two to join we can easily integrate into a group to play in pretty short notice.",

YouTubers work a lot better since the video stays up forever basically, but developers have said they still don't usually make back what they paid most influencers.\n\nThis is a game that is very fun to watch, and thus works _very_ well with Streamers. If you paid 1000 streamers to play your Platformer, FPS, Metroidvania, or JRPG, you likely wouldn't get the money back in sales.\n\nObviously if enough streamers play it consistently it will sell regardless, but data's shown that for most games, streamers don't really have much of an impact on sales.\n\nBuilding your community and having a catchy hook is the tried and true method. Bottom line is there's been tons of data on marketing indie games, and not everything works for every game.",

For most people it has just been kind of dry from what I've seen being said about it. The battle pass was too short and the time until the next one was too long. People completed it and are waiting until the next season comes out. If that has more to grind out, it will stick around for longer.",

There is no simple solution to it other than just play private games in communities. They could therefore add Friendlist/Guilds/Communities ingame, so its easier to make games with no leavers.",

A sense of 'presence' whether through chat or gameplay or actual physical presence is necessary to gradually build up that baseline level of trust. You can't skip it or shortcut it. \n\nThat usually requires having some interest in common whether it's professional (met in school/work) or some hobby (sports/gaming) or civic organization/political movement or club or self-improvement group.\n\nBut to really be great friends with ppl you have to eventually transcend that one activity, and work to share other activities with the people you care about. You can share some of your own but you also have to open yourself to possibility of truly enjoying activities with other people.\n\nSome people who are used to being in control and feeling knowledgeable have to go out of their comfort zone and acknowledge someone else as more knowledgeable within a new domain. It can be very difficult for some people to do that and that can hold them back from forming deeper friendships.",

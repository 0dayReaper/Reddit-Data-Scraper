Reading any thread about CDPR here gives me a headache with the amount of negativity and hostility against the dev. It's like outside of r/games, CDPR have a great reputation but in here people gets riled up about anything around the dev and any positive point WILL be looked down and condescended. Even this thread I am replying have people shitting on the dev because... the said people can't read...?\n\nI mean, CDPR is assuring us that their single player game CP2077 will not have microtransaction but some people is talking about having the cake and eating it too... what? They're not even taking the moral high ground here, their stance is literally [\"Microtransactions? In a single player role-playing game? Are you nuts?\"](https://www.pcgamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-trailer-secretly-confirms-there-will-be-no-microtransactions/) which was from 2 years ago. Now if CDPR talks about MTX in a *separate multiplayer game that'll be released two years after CP2077*? Oh boy, it turns into a shitstorm. Did people simply forget that Gwent exist? A (F2P) game with MTX from the same dev...? So now suddenly people are outraged if CDPR release another multiplayer game with MTX? Not a consistent stance.\n\nThe culture of being outraged about everything in r/games is sad given this sub is usually my main source of keeping up to date with gaming news.\n\nEdit: Typos.",

They're doing things 95% of the games industry is doing. They've got a single player game with no microtransactions and a multiplayer with microtransactions. Rockstar games and Bioware games both have this exact same model, where was the praise for them? You want me to make a big list similar to you of single player RPGs without microtransactions?\n\nI wouldn't call it anti-CDPR, I'd say that it's people pushing completely worthless cyberpunk news to the top and then getting angry when people say 'so what'. People were blind to the marketing spiel when the Witcher 3 came out with the 12 free DLC nonsense, now they aren't.",

It started because after The Witcher 3 released, this whole sub was sucking CDPR's dick so hard that any criticism of the game was heavily downvoted.\n\nThere was one comment that particularly exemplified how bad this sub was at the time, I thought I had it saved but I can't find it now so maybe the guy deleted it. The guy was basically saying \"Overall I liked The Witcher 3, I just have a few problems with it\" and he was sitting at like -50 points because he had the audacity to criticize Geraldo even a little bit.\n\nSo when you have that level of circlejerk on a subreddit, eventually you're gonna brew enough resentment to the game and its developer to create an anti-circlejerk. The problem with Redditors, or I guess just people in general, is that they just fucking can't handle nuance. Either you're a saint or literally Hitler. So CDPR went from being saints to being vilified when really it should've been something in between.",

Which is bullshit. There are companies that are very light on crunch, like many parts of EA, Ubisoft or Bethesda. And when they crunch, it's for limited time. CDPR crunches for months and years and does it in a really brutal and exhausting way.\n\nAlso, people keep focusing on crunch only. There's other shit that CDPR has done. Suing of crack authors. Lying about Witcher 3 graphics. Lying about Witcher 3 RedKit. Dodging the EGS discount coupon... CDPR's issue isn't only crunch. They are not pro-consumer. They are simply pro-money. CDPR isn't above greed and scheming.\n\nSure, their PR is effective, but only because gamers are still high on Witcher 3. If gamers were skeptical about their PR as they are about other companies' PR, CDPR reputation would deservedly drop to the levels of Bethesda and Blizzard.",

Granted, at the time I played that with a close group of friends, but it was really well done. The enemies were diverse, interesting and challenging. The 3 enemy factions were distinct and all played differently, the playable characters and their powers likewise were incredibly cool (getting to play an almost invincible maxed out Krogan Vanguard is still one of the biggest power trips in games) and the way you could combine power attacks from different players to cause biotic explosions meant communicating and timing your attacks with your friends was extremely rewarding.",

My impression at the time was that BioWare must've been laying the groundwork for something bigger given it wasn't really the type of thing they had done before but wanted to minimize the risk by introducing it in this way.  And perhaps that was partially the truth considering the game the studio moved onto next, but I would've really preferred a fully-fledged Mass Effect multiplayer game than what we got with Anthem, or even some of EA's other FPS games if we're being honest.",

Unfortunately, the reality is that any aspect of multiplayer makes games significantly more complex.

They\u2019re just off the top of my head, but I think the singular focus on a solo-player RPG is a fantastic idea. If (or when) the game sells like crazy, they can work through it and see what people enjoy the most, and then use it as a foundation to build multiplayer.\n\nOne step at a time.

Although personally I'd rather pay full price for a game with no mtx. At least F2P makes it more accessible.\n\nI hope CDPR will never mix a full price game + mtx, but I guess we'll see...",

However, to play devil\u2019s advocate a bit, are they even wrong / immoral for doing so? The multiplayers for gta 5 and rdr2 are wildly different games from their respective singleplayer counterparts. I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if the majority of people who enjoyed the singleplayers didn\u2019t even touch the multiplayers. So is it really a bad thing to advertise this way? Plus it\u2019s not like they\u2019re lying, the micro transactions have 0 effect on the singleplayer. You can\u2019t even buy them that easily, you have to go through separate loading screens just for the opportunity to *see* them. I think gta5 online on pc has a separate button on the rockstar launcher entirely",

[When they describe it in this article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-unlikely-to-release-in-/1100-6472825/), it\u2018s definitely depicted more as a \u201cmultiplayer mode\u201d that will come free to Cyberpunk 2077 owners. All this conjecture only has me more confused, haha",

That would be dumb, because you can just mod a single player game. I imagine it's the same kind of thing here. They'll probably sell skins or some such for online, which is whatever. If there's no MTX for SP it's not big deal.",

It's not DLC, it's being referred to as a stand alone title, thus two different games.

As you can see, no mention of the multiplayer there. They have since changed the title, but that doesn't change that it was literally clickbait initially.",

Especially if the multiplayer is free for everyone. \n\n\nOverwatch has MTX, I loved that game and bought into the cosmetics more than a few times. The game is 4 years old and still going strong (iirc). Though now I do not like the practice of lootboxes specifically.\n\n\nI think I am fine if they release a multiplayer (paid or free) with MTX (skins, not pay-to-win) if it covers server costs then more power to them.\n\nSure in an ideal world, we pay $60 and get to play the game online as much as we want... but that AWS bill isn't paying itself and it is substantial (source: I work for a cloud service provider that resells Azure)",

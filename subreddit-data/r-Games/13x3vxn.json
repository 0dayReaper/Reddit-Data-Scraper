I finally played We &lt;3 Katamari for the first time last year after adoring the original, and I was surprised how many of the songs I didn't vibe with or just felt like they were retreading old ground. There are bright spots (yes Everlasting Love slaps, as does the racing level where you first hear it) but others just didn't match the consistent quality of Damacy's soundtrack, to me. The low point was Killing Hot Savannah \u2013 which was funny with all the animal noises on first listen, but once it loops it's a special kind of hell medley.",

It feels like collisions aren't quite as punishing as they used to be or something, but I may just be used to PS2 framerate and stronger controller vibrations.\n- I don't think the tutorial stage teaches you about boosting or jumping over the katamari. I haven't seen any reference to those moves... not sure how a new player is supposed to pick that up, seems like a big oversight. Not 100% necessary, but I use the reverse jump move quite a bit and the boost situationally. \n- Everything else is perfect. can't wait to play it on the plane tomorrow.",

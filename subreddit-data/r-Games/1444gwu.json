Peter Molyneux was most certainly an interesting person in gaming and have brought forth memorable games that he and his teams have produced, however, a number of times he let his mouth and dreams get the best of him.  The things that he had spoken of that would in Fable was more detrimental than them not being in the game without a word said about them in the first place.  Carving our names in trees, planting trees and watching them grow, watching us age with time.  It was a lot that we were promised, at least for the first fable that never got to shine, and it left a bad taste in some of our mouths as gamers.\n\nStill, I love the franchise none the less, it is just I feel it is in safer hands with Playground Games now.",

PM is definitely a grifter and even looking at his statements as lofty aspirations and not purposefully misleading selling tactics, he set bad expectations. \n\nOn the other, I do think he and the team shot for the stars and landed on a cloud quite often, so to speak (esp. With Fable 1 and 2). I hope that Playground continues to experiment and push the envelope instead of making it a fairly iterative experience that borrows too much from other games. \n\nI might be a bit biased because I read a rumour that they were looking to base Fable on The Witcher 3, and while I love that game for what it is, it's a quite static world and doesn't really have the same core design objectives that a new Fable game should have, IMO.",

Good contrast to most western fantasy games these days which trends toward being dark.\n\nJust make a few fun levels, cool environments, incredibly British voice actors, let my character burp at people, I'll be satisfied. The one thing it shouldn't try to be is as cosmically big as a lot of games try to be these days. Keep it concise.",

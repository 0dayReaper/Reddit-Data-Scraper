They've got so much money; lots of other studios would kill for just a fraction of it to support them in their creative endeavors. No one's going to remember all the TF2 hats, gambling or other money-making schemes they've hit upon over the years. At a bare minimum, can't they spare 10% of the company to put out a quality game every few years? Does *no one* there want to do that anymore? It's just such a waste.",

Chell has escaped the facility. The portal gun remains there, and even if she had it it does not work without moon rocks. Pulling her back in a second time like they did when they retconned the ending of the first one would be dumb, and there isn't much left of the lore to explore.\n\nThe only thing they could really do, besides tell a totally unrelated story about someone we've never heard of before, which wouldn't really advance the story at all, might be a story about the old 1950's looking portal gun in the posters which warned about the potential for time travel. You'd be playing a new character but at least it would tie back into the main story through a reference. I'm not sure what that new/old portal gun would do, but someone alrerady did a portal mod involving time travel to solve puzzles, so it would kinda feel like a rehash of that if that's what they did.\n\nPersonally, I'm more hyped for another Half Life game. They can't just leave us dangling forever again after what they did at the end of Alyx. I'm just afraid if they do it they'll ditch VR and make it for like the Steam Deck, which while I'm sure many folks would appreciate, as someone who's lost interest in anything that's not VR, it would kinda suck after what an amazing experience Alyx was and the tease at the end of it.",

Creatives \"belong\" both to R&amp;D and marketing, so if you weren't working on game content you'd be working on menial stuff like email blasts and web content and \"adding pizzazz\" to language files (relabeling buttons that say boring things like \"Accept\" to cringy things like \"Let's Do This!\", in accordance with the brand vision and market research). And patch notes. Some poor bastard has to write those, you know. Masters in English and they're up at two in the morning trying to translate \"we made the thing stop doing the thing when you like, click it, but you clicked the other thing first so it freaked out\" into professional business communication.\n\nProbably somebody like this has the sway to opt out of the scutwork, but that's the kind of thing Valve likely would've had him do for the last 10 years otherwise. It sounds like he's got a deal worked out where he works as a contractor when they need him for a specific project. I kind of doubt (even) Valve pays (even) the guy that wrote Portal enough for that to be a sole source of income for 10 years, though. So given all my experience, I'd guess he probably self-publishes erotica on Amazon under a pen name.",

Dota Underlords was just a rebranded community mod (Auto Chess). Alyx was superb but only accessable to 5% of the PC gaming market due to it being VR only. Desk Job is a 30min tech demo for the Steam Deck. \n\nIf you add up the sales of all of those games and hours played it likely would only amount to a fraction of even some of their worst IPs in the 2000s. I think the community misses the quality and frequency of absolute banger AAA titles to that Valve became known for. \n\nFor me, while I miss that level of game production, other companies have stepped up and filled the gap. Been gaming for 30+ years and the amount of high quality games available is absurd, I would need another lifetime to get through my entire back catalog.",

The lows were pretty low but the highs were higher than dare I say in other card games I'd tried. Obviously it had many issues including RNG and monetisation, not sure what Richard Garfield (creator of MtG) was thinking when he tried to spruik the monetisation as being the best option. I do feel that if Artifact was actually F2P and having its gameplay issues ironed out over time, it could still be a tertiary title with hundreds of thousands of active players.\n\nAs for Underlords, perhaps at the start it was very similar, but it eventually evolved beyond DAC and became its own thing with different mechanics and its own little world building and campaign thingymajig. Even after development ceased, there were still hundreds of thousands of people actively playing. Right now there are still tens of thousands of active players for a game that was essentially abandoned 17 months ago.",

Developing video games is basically Valves lowest priority at this point, hell former employees will tell you themselves, which is also why a lot of them moved on. \n\nWhat\u2019s surprising about Valve is that it\u2019s still a private company, totally uncorrupted by corporate shareholder nonsense that plagues other giants like EA, Activision Blizzard, etc., yet what do they do prove with their success? Well the same thing! that it was never really about video games, it was about printing as giant a pile of money as possible until you die, even if that means releasing nothing but lootboxes and shitty card games forever. \n\nMaybe once you become a billionaire you just stop giving a fuck about anything, who knows. The fact that Gabe let such a ground breaking series like half life die unresolved and in obscurity out of pure laziness speaks for itself I think.",

In Super Mario Sunshine and Wind Waker for the GC, Nintendo used mipmaps to instead change the detail rather than use it to prevent aliasing to give a more \"accurate\" depiction of water. Water close to the camera has caustics and waves and what not, but water far away appears to meld together. Wind Waker HD skips this effect entirely, and instead uses regular mipmaps. Super Mario Galaxy on Switch on the other hand doesn't have this issue, likely due to it being a much more required feature compared to WW\n\n[Example](https://i.imgur.com/8xwzsnI.jpg) and [blog post](https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/11/03/dolphin-progress-report-october-2017/#50-5745-add-heuristic-for-detecting-custom-mipmaps-by-tomcc)",

I would be shocked if their donations havent had an increase as people are donating to help fund what they think is an imminent legal battle (whether it happens or not, the donation is still Dolphins).\n\nI guess I fail to see how Dolphin is behind at the moment. Virtually no one is truly taking the side of Nintendo. At worst, people are saying what youre saying.",

Dolphin knew what they were using, and that isn\u2019t completely out of the gray area.\n\nSure they\u2019re getting donations and that\u2019s great. I\u2019m glad Dolphin is getting community support. My concern is this is a gray area in the law. Like you, I personally don\u2019t see how this should be illegal either. You\u2019re preaching to the choir here.\n\nThe worry I see that if this does go to trial is how pro corporations the courts are currently. This isn\u2019t 20 years ago when Sony went to count over Bleem. The landscape has largely changed in the US. If this swings the other way it could be completely disastrous to emulation and more importantly preservation. This isn\u2019t a slam dunk for Dolphin to win. I\u2019d rather not take the chance on how a Judge is feeling that day.",

These provisions changed the remedies for the circumvention of copy-prevention systems (also called \"technical protection measures\"). The section contains a number of specific limitations and exemptions, for such things as government research and reverse engineering in specified situations. Although section 1201(c) of the title stated that the section does not change the underlying substantive copyright infringement rights, remedies, or defenses, it did not make those defenses available in circumvention actions. The section does not include a fair use exemption from criminality nor a scienter requirement, so criminal liability could attach to even unintended circumvention for legitimate purposes.\n\nNow the thing is, copyright does have exceptions in circumventing DRM to allow interoperability. But there is nuance what interoperability means (most examples in which it was granted was just \"read a file created by the protected software to display it on a different platform\" and not just \"recreate the same functions of the software\") and question remains if they key also exists as a way to ensure proof of ownership rather than just provide a hardware lock. The latter can be legally circumvented. The former can not.",

The point is that it DOES have the Wii common key, and under the DMCA, Nintendo has a pretty good case against Dolphin.\n\nI kinda feel like people are conflating their personal feelings of what ***should or should not*** be illegal, with the reality of what is or is not ***actually illegal***.\n\nLike, I agree philosophically here - the idea that distributing this well-known, reverse-engineered encryption key could be illegal according to the DMCA is absolutely absurd.\n\nBut regardless of how I personally feel the world **should** work, the reality is that given that it's in a legally grey area, best emulation practices are to NOT distribute encryption keys along with the emulator, and have the user supply their own. By not doing this, Dolphin is opening themselves up to legal threats from Nintendo, and putting the future of the Dolphin project at risk.\n\nThere's a reason *every single other emulator* does it that way, after all.",

Shit's expensive these days and the average person's income is nowhere near what it should be.

For example, in the article it is mentioned that Nintendo pressured Valve to remove Dolphin but if you go and read the emails or any story from last week you'd see Valve started an open dialogue with Nintendo to make sure they would be alright with it before it hit Steam. \n\n As for the argument I think this lies in a grey area like most emulation. Emulation as an act of game preservation is crucial and in no way stifles innovation. However, more often than not these games that are being emulated are usually developed under strict constraints from hardware and such and emulating a game can take that aspect away. Much of innovation in games especially early games is due to hardware constraints, such as fitting audio on a small cartridge. While emulation might devalue the constraints the developers had to work around it does not dismiss the need for preservation.",

Wether that be maliciously, or unintentionally via an internet wide game of telephone.\n\nBut you're right. Nintendo isn't attacking emulators but some of the underlying technical intricacies in emulating games which could allow people to obtain legal copies of said games. Which people seem to see, or try to erroneously present as Nintendo attacking the idea of emulators as a whole.\n\nThe meat of the argument surrounding the \"common-key\" is actually an interesting one. Nintendo says the key is proprietary data. Proprietary or copyrightable data is a well understood legal principal, but there are limits to it.\n\nESPN can certainly stop people from scaping and reselling all their sports statistics. At the same time it is more than fair use to lift limited stats and reference them to make a point elsewhere.\n\nYou need the key to emulate even legally obtained games, while it also facilitates illegal copies to circulate.\n\nCan Nintendo use a key needed to perform a legal task as a means to take down something because there is potential for illegal use?\n\nCan Dolphin remove the key from their emulator and instead add a screen to nudge users who own a legal copy of a game to go get the key themselves; this circumventing Nintendo's argument of property data in their code?\n\nWho knows, but it'd be interesting to find out. The problem is Nintendo has more money than God, and our legal system is structured in such a way, particularly with copyright and patent law that if you've got money you can bully everyone else out. Copyright battles are often protracted and so caught up in the semantics and minutia that it takes obscene amounts of time and resources to make any headway. Which the little guys simply don't have.",

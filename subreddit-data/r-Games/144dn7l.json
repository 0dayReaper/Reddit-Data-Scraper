Those ideas are not complimentary to a single player franchise. \n\nBut the good news for you is that extraction shooters are apparently going to be the next big thing that studios focus one.

The Shock remake is perhaps the closest since they originally tried to veer further away from the original, but what they delivered leans heavily on the design of the 1994 original.\n\nI suspect that, to be viable in the long run, they'll need to eventually start making games of their own.",

And crucially, has a dynamic Shodan that will advance on her own and win the \"run\" if you cannot keep up - with the player being able to sabotage her advances and so on. \n\nEverything about System Shock, even the 1994 version, seems naturally set up for a more dynamic campaign against an AI.

                    "comment": "Exactly. Having recently played the System Shock Remake, there's a lot of old school design principle there we don't see anymore but still works surprisingly well. I think people get upset with it when they realize it's not an FPS and it's not even that close to a recognizable, modern immersive sim. It's closer to an old school first person dungeon crawler (like Ultima Underworld obviously), but what I think it's actually closest to is a player vs. game style board game.\n\nThink about it. The difficulty settings in the beginning are just like handicaps in a manual, \"for a shorter game cap at 10 turns, for more action roll 3 die in combat instead of 2, for more difficulty collect only 2 ammo chips when passing Start, etc.\" The status screen is like your score card keeping track of your objectives like life pod and grove status. It's not a game about killing and being killed, it's a game about completing objectives. The obtuse and angular level design are like cardboard cutout pieces defining the play area and SHODAN is a creepy, mechanical head that occasionally screeches threatening audio at you like one of those [90's board games](https://theawesomedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/90s-board-games-14-1.jpg).\n\nThe game really starts to make the most sense when you set Mission Difficulty to 3 and play with a 10 hour time limit. Now SHODAN isn't just a quirky antagonist in an immersive sim, she's a real opponent that can win the game while you lose and her threats take on a new dimension.\n\nLike, how cool is that? It's so special and unique and I see so many people complaining about bad game design when it's one of the tightest games I think I've ever played.",

The map design I've seen so far really helps - it gives the impression of a maze which I like but isn't actually too hard to navigate with a map.\n\nAlso shocked by how much voice acting is in the game. I was a bit worried after picking up a text log that they would quickly become the standard with the occasional audio log, but it seems to be the exact opposite. Still pretty early but really digging it, probably going to jump on 2 later this summer.",

It would be cool if each of the objectives had individual fail states that could branch the story and make your interactions with SHODAN (or similar AI antagonist) more dynamic.\n\nAs it stands though, SHODAN is still one of the most dynamic villains in a game (that I've played). She has constant access to you and can pop up at any time to taunt or insult you. In addition to this, you're directly foiling her plans and causing her to readjust what she's doing. She's not **just** a final boss sitting at the end of the game waiting for you to finally show up and kill her.",

She is the reason why there is a threat, but she herself isn't the treat directly. \n\nTo be honest, not really. The original is too old for such (relatively) advanced mechanics. Reducing the security level doesn't really do anything (in regards to shodan reacting to you). Her reactions to you are mostly scripted (other then the random respawns). The remake stays very close to the original for this, and thus doesn't really change it.\n\nShe is mainly there for the narrative. They wanted to give a reason why the station revolts against the inhabitants. The story also only makes sense on the highest difficulty where you have a time limit. \n\nSHODAN is just very memorable to a lot of people (me included). Most AI antagonists are very humanized, usually because they either look human, or act human. But SHODAN is just \"i'm a god, fuck you\", helped by the weird speech effects. She is a head on a monitor, but when you actually fight her, she is just a shape.",

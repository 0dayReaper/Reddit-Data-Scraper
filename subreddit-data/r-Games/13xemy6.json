Any items not earned during the season are then rolled into the loot pool for various reward systems in the game.  \n\n\nGSG makes their money from community support by buying their DLCs. The most current one had bad comments for not being as unique as the community had hoped. GSG then revamped the DLC and paint job for players prior to it's release.   \n\n\nDRG and it's devs are worth your money/time.",

I'm unlocking *everything,* not just the free-tier stuff. Is this a glitch?\" and I'm like, \"no, you don't understand! There *is* no 'free-tier'! All 100 levels are 100% free! That's what I meant by it being free!\" He was far more hyped after the full explanation, haha.\n\nJust thought I'd share this, in case some of you also don't understand \"Free Battle Pass.\"",

Left 4 Dead broke new ground in terms of creating mechanics to encourage team play, but it feels like nothing was learned. The Battlefield games feel among the worst for sucking all fun out of the objective gamemodes because how how poorly incentivised they are. Games like Borderlands even increase the strength of enemies irrespective of a joining player's level so that if you're underlevelled you literally won't be able to deal even 1 point of damage to the enemies, while making it harder for every other player too. Absolutely mental design decisions that make playing cooperatively incredibly punishing if you and your player group aren't in perfect sync.\n\nIt's unfortunately very refreshing to see titles that don't seem to be secretly trying to make the experience as miserable as possible.",

The \"season pass\" is completely free and optional and just serves as additional goals for each season. If you don't manage to finish it, all the cosmetics in there will go into the various aquiring systems of the game by normal means (like some in the ingame shop, some through random loot in a mission). Thus, everything can be unlocked at your own pace. Even seasonal cosmetics in seasonal events are always given out in addition to new participation rewards the next time a seasonal event rolls out (with the exception of the yearly anniversary hat and one or two beta rewards, which stay exclusive. but that is fair)\n\nThe game overall is not my absolute favourite game (that place is held by Vermintide2) but nobody can deny that it is a work of love with devs that listen and that it is a great game in itself. They really respect your time and all of the malpractices in the game industry and that deserved a lot of praise on its own!!",

They complain about how bitter, anxious, and downright depressed they feel due to their interactions in these games. I stopped trying to convince them to move on a long time ago so I just listen and nod now, but it's definitely a powerful reminder that toxicity in PvP gaming has only gotten worse over time. Swatting, doxxing, etc. are all modern forms of harassment that were unheard of back in the 90s. Doxxing became more prevalent in the early 2000s but it was mostly limited to social media/forums, and then in MMOs. \n\nBest decision I made in my gaming life.",

They have higher base stat and an additional passive (that hasn't been relevant in quite a while). At the end of the day it's not really that much better. If you mod the same, then the prime versions extra stats are negligible. And there are multiple ways of getting them, without spending money",

For your reference, I have spent like 15USD  on Warframe, just to support after ~150 hours and I have ~10 prime frames and even more weapons. The premium currency is easily farmable in game, so you can \"whale\" just by grinding a little.\n\nAnd just to showcase the power levels - my currently favourite frame, Protea, doesn't have a prime version yet and I still play her over the primes I have. They are only slightly stronger.\n\nOverall, I actually like WF's model a lot, just wish they would tone down the FOMO events, but they do not give you anything ultra special, so I just ignore them.",

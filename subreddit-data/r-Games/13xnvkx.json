Despite having branching paths No Mercy's story mode is still incredibly short. \n\nI do love though that it looks like the entire game is intergender and it was confirmed on New Legacy's video that women can compete for for the men's titles as Kris Statlander won the TNT title.",

            "comment": "Everything in this looks so dated...pandemic camera, bad graphics, no full entrances, 2021 Omega entrance, 2022 Women's title, wrestlers who have been in AEW for years not in the base game like Matt Hardy and FTR and it appears like finishers/signatures will go away after some time so it'll be like No Mercy where your opponent will run away until your special is gone.\n\nAnd the worst part is people will say \"well No Mercy did it.\" There's no reason to copy over four-generation old technical limitations like a stage camera or a crappy finisher system where you can't store it.\n\nYou can pre-order this to get Matt Hardy but this game will probably be $20 after a month so I'll wait.",

It's probably all be paid DLC.\n\nAnd seeing as how the game still doesn't have the women's title that debuted 15 months ago, I wouldn't get my hopes up about any new arenas getting added. Meanwhile, in WWE 2K23, I just downloaded the Double or Nothing arena from a week ago.",

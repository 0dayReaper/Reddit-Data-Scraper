The artstyle is almost exactly the same to the point where you could think it copies assets directly. People who touch this will think they play a game that looks like ROR2, but doesnt play as good so why bother?\n\nYou need to set yourself apart a bit more from what inspired you, otherwise people will rather play the inspiration.",

A lot of comments in his thread stated it was completely legal, which is fine and all... but it's a douchey tactic and I figured others (like myself) might want to avoid purchasing games from companies that do so.\n\n[Here's a link to the original post!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/39ckjx/some_companies_are_raising_prices_on_their_steam/)\n\nedit: removed price gouging term.",

According to your second link\n\n&gt;If the former price is the actual, bona fide price at which the article was offered to the public on a regular basis for a reasonably substantial period of time, it provides a legitimate basis for the advertising of a price comparison.\n\nSo if the companies are actually selling the product for the increased price (and they are, via steam), as long as they remain at that price for a \"reasonably substantial period of time\" then they're in the clear. You have to be able to *prove* that their intent is to deceive which is difficult. \n\nIf the prices are raised only for a short time before the sale (which appears to be what's happening) *and then* fall back to their previously listed price shortly after the sale you'd probably have a case. Problem is, we still have to wait and see. It's possible that the price increases will be permanent following the sale, or at least will remain in place for a \"reasonably substantial period of time\".\n\nIt seems pretty obvious what's going on, it's just difficult to prove and relies on a somewhat subjective bit of language.",

Raising your price immediately before a sale, and then advertising the new prices as a discount of the raised price is illegal in the US.\n\nhere is an example used by the FTC in their guide against Deceptive Pricing:\n\n&gt;(c) The following is an example of a price comparison based on a fictitious former price. John Doe is a retailer of Brand X fountain pens, which cost him $5 each. His usual markup is 50 percent over cost; that is, his regular retail price is $7.50. In order subsequently to offer an unusual \"bargain'', Doe begins offering Brand X at $10 per pen. He realizes that he will be able to sell no, or very few, pens at this inflated price. But he doesn't care, for he maintains that price for only a few days. Then he \"cuts'' the price to its usual level -- $7.50 -- and advertises: \"Terrific Bargain: X Pens, Were $10, Now Only $7.50!'' This is obviously a false claim. The advertised \"bargain'' is not genuine.",

Glad to have something reliable to read on this.\nI will note this isn't a black-and-white issue. If the pre-sale price is an actual price the seller does use, it may be acceptable even if the product was on sale, then off sale shortly before the summer sale. Whereas, if the product was always one price, and then the price was raised just before the sale and then put back to the normal price for the \"sale,\" that would fit the conduct described above.",

They are selling each copy for just 5 less bucks, but they are also selling twice (or more ?) the amount of copies they sell on a regular day. I have to admit, it's beautiful how they can manipulate the market so easily, and with Valve's agreement apparently (as they allow that).",

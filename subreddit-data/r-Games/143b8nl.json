They are not that emotionally attached to the existence of Bloodlines 2. They were THIS close to cancelling the game outright in early 2021.\n\n&gt;For a game that\u2019s been in development hell for so long, screenshots mean even less.\r  \n\r\n\nThese are screenshots of the new version of the game, by a new developer. They serve to establish the new artistic direction of the game, and I'm sure people savvier than me will glean a lot from them.",

What Paradox wants to do is just stich together with wire and gum some random team and try to make some multiplatform game. Thats not how things that work out well are done",

That first game problems aside was also such a time and place when it was made by the people who made it.\n\nIf people don't know Troika was founded by the creator of Fallout and 2 of the most influence other developers/artists on Fallout 1. They all left together early in Fallout 2 development to form Troika. They were masters as you said of those kind of RPGs. The knock against them was buggy releases etc. But you can't deny the strength of the RPG elements of their games at all. \n\nTim Cain the creator of Fallout has his own Youtube channel now where he shares very honest stories about lot of the failing of Troika and successes as well as why he left Fallout 2 early in development. Really interesting stuff and seems like a genuinely awesome person. He goes into why they had buggy issues with those games etc as well. I'd highly recommend his channel. He's partially retired and just consults on games now. He posts pretty much a new video every day.",

It was just at the point where they were already doing marketing that showcased the various editions of the game when it ended up going on what would be it's years long hiatus.  This is basically a game that was \"finished\" and they decided to scrap it and start over.  Whatever happens with the release of this game, I'm dying for the inevitable *post mortem* that will describe exactly what went down, who's to blame, and all the other drama that followed.  We know bits and pieces of it, but man, there's got to be so much more there.  LOL!",

I mean, there's the obvious generic answer that it \"wasn't meeting expectations for quality\", but this was a game that was months away from releasing.  Typically, when a game is months away from it's release day, is taking pre-orders, and has promotional trailers making the rounds, the only thing that's being worked on are finishing up QA issues.  The last 6 months of production are usually the hardest on the testers who are doing TONS of work to make sure the game is ready to ship.  Sure, a game might get pushed a a few months to fix an issue, but it's been YEARS!  I can't help but imagine something crazy must have gone down.",

Remember that Paradox had already decided to cancel Bloodlines 2 when they were approached by the new developer.\n\n&gt;considering that this update talks about refunds\n\nThe game that people pre-ordered doesn't exist anymore.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;*With the bonus content being updated, the prior physical edition offered items that are no longer representative of the game. This includes the Collector\u2019s Edition created and sold by DPA Merchandising GmbH(formerly Gaya Entertainment GmbH), and all physical versions of the First Blood edition, Unsanctioned edition and Blood Moon edition disc.*\n\nAs an example, the physical edition came with a figurine for the character Elif, who is very likely not even present in the new version of Bloodlines 2.\n\nAlso, the refunds for preorders may become necessary as people realize that the game they preordered, the game they expected, proves wildly different to the game they're getting.",

I was just pointing out the Hardsuit version was missing MANY key members of the original. There's no reason newer developers and writers can't make a name for themselves here with this sequel.\n\nEdit: On the off chance you were talking about Chris as the second writer, he talked about it on his blog already.

Hardsuit created the game it had set out to make.  Paradox, meanwhile, saw the interest and decided Bloodlines 2 was going to be a new tentpole franchise - and what Hardsuit had created was not triple A enough.\n\nQue the drama.  \n\nI believe that Paradox still has this prioritized as a tentpole of their business model.  I also believe that when it does release, it will be a Ubisoft-style game more than a Troika-style game.\n\nAgain, this is a theory based only on publicly available information, but I will definitely be letting the review cycle come happen before I get my hopes up for this version of the game.",

There is a tendency to ascribe Bloodlines to Mitsoda, and I don't really agree with it. The following people contributed writing to VtM Bloodlines:\n\n* \rBrian Mitsoda\n* Chad Moore\n* TJ Perillo\n* Jason D. Anderson\n* Leonard Boyarsky\n\nI never liked how the marketing for Bloodlines 2 pushed Mitsoda as the man who wrote Bloodlines as though he sat down and wrote all the characters and stuff on his own.\n\n&gt;Who are they going to replace him with? They can't just pull someone off the street to fill in.\n\nThe team who got the job will have their own writers, and their own vision for a sequel. Look at Deus Ex. None of the writers from the original Deus Ex worked on the new Deus Ex games. (Some of the OG writers worked on projects like Lost Planet 3 and the God of War reboot and stuff.) The new writers did not have the same perspectives as the original writers, but they did a decent job.\n\n&gt;They've got to be interested in the source and have an actual vision for the game as well as be good.\n\nIt's important to remember that \"the source\" is the tabletop game, not VtM: Bloodlines. I'm sure that the Bloodlines 2 team will attempt to capture some of the sardonic aspects of Bloodlines which distinguished it from the rest of the VtM projects. Bloodlines has always felt like a kind of parody of VtM, like Galaxy Quest compared to Star Trek. It's a combination of self-aware bemusement while also taking the setting absolutely seriously. So obviously Bloodlines 2 isn't going to be dry vampire politics and scheming like Swansong, or edgy urban fantasy like some of the text adventure games. But I think that expecting the EXACT same late 90s early 2000s gothic self-aware parody tone of VTMB1 is probably unwise.\n\nThe new team will have their own vision of how a Bloodlines sequel should be handled in the context of the franchise as a whole, and Bloodlines as a distinct sub-series.",

If any big budget studio was working on it, we'd know by now. It's probably being worked on by the B-team at a small studio who has just been working on a shoe-string budget to turn what they were handed into something releasable, which is why it's taking forever, but also why it's not cancelled. It must be costing them very little and they don't need much return on investment to make a profit.",

Development then became a shit show with missed milestones and from the gameplay footage that we saw consensus in the VTMB sub was that the game looked janky and not particularly good.",

Most important is the sheer atmosphere and presence it has, many places in cp77 have already burnt into my mind, its a bit like an open world bloodlines in terms of that. Theres sprawling slums with dense little nooks and crannys, corporate downtowns with insanely impressive presentation, you can buy comfy little apartments and stuff (4 right now). Gameplay wise its also kind of very similar in the end, theres usually several different ways to do stuff, you can just blast through people, sneak, hack into their cameras and clear them out without even setting foot inside etc. quite a lot like bloodlines, in the sense that its not fully immersive sim like dishonored but pretty close. Writing is also generally good with a bunch of interesting and likeable characters. Then theres the meta layer of the game basically coming out buggy as hell, in my eyes its an insanely similar story to bloodlines.\n\nI'd certainly recommend getting it IF youve got a PC that can run it and mod it. If youve got something like a PS5 its still most likely worth it (though i cant say for sure), but game's probably not worth it on the PS4 generation that simply cannot handle what the game is trying to pull. On a PC, especially with quality of life mods, its instantly one of my favorite games, and literally the spiritual successor to bloodlines ive been waiting for.",

There's even a quest in the game where you basically track down and watch a snuff film, just like in bloodlines. You also get to break into people's computers everywhere and read their little emails and stuff.",

I've actually already played 2077 and really enjoyed it so was more so wondering about Bloodlines but I definitely get the picture, if they are indeed similar then I'm bound to enjoy Bloodlines. The atmosphere was easily my favorite part so I crave more of that. Plus the whole vampire theme sounds really cool, and both cp77 and Bloodlines are based on TTRPGs that came out at roughly the same times (late '80s/early '90s) with similar fanbases so I've heard about it from time to time. I've played a bit of Bloodhunt (the battle royale game) which was surprisingly good for such an oversaturated genre and I loved the dark gothic atmosphere so I think I will def check out Bloodlines then. Thanks :)\n\nAlso I'm assuming you have already played it but if you haven't, Deus Ex is also very similar to cp77!",

It's the kind of game where you (well, me at least) just stand around in your apartment listening to the radio and the sounds of the night because you're that immersed in it.\n\nI actually have played a little bit of the original deus ex, and despite being a fan of immersive sims in general (got into them with Dishonored), I couldn't really get into deus ex for some reason, just didn't grip me into the world somehow (I played a few levels), maybe it's just the age and the fact that I came at it from the future going backwards, don't know. Might try again one day though.",

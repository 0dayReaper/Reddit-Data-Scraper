Most of this lawsuit/joycon drift stuff has been people filing complaints and/or lawsuits and getting told off by Nintendo.\n\nIt's ridiculous because no external study really needs to be done, the sheer number of reports about this issue is a good enough indicator that there's something wrong.\n\nAt my job, if I get flooded emails about users having some issue, even if none of them provide any type of reproducible steps, if I get a hundred complaints that are all by people completely disconnected from each other, there's no way there's not an issue.\n\nThe sheer number of reports about joycon drift issues makes it pretty clear that there's something wrong. The problem is all Nintendo does is insist that nothing is wrong, that it's your environment's fault, (like them telling us joycons disconnecting issues with release joycons might be because we have an aquarium in our houses, what the fuck was that shit?) or clearly you damaged your joycons. No admittance of fault or even that there could be something wrong. They just blame us.\n\nExcept when you have thousands upon thousands of people who have never met and often don't even live in the same country, there's no way it's user error. It's just not possible unless they've designed the worst, most faulty hardware in human existence. And at that point how is it not still their problem to handle? Design flaws are still on the manufacturer to resolve.",

Both for joy-cons, and very obviously faulty Switch that just makes more noises and struggles more than it did when I got it. Mind you that was like 3 years ago.\n\n Why is it bad that I called support while moving? Because in my country the phone support gives you a specific \"bond\" or whatever it's called via e-mail. It is basically a free-shipping ticket so that you can send your stuff to them. The thing is, the thing they send you is a web page that has that specific one on it. They don't send you the file of the damn thing, no, they send you a whole page that has nothing but that on it. And that page expires. For no fucking reason.\n\n I checked that the page worked on my end, was happy, closed it, finished moving out, got ready to deal with that stuff a month later, and the page was down. I called back to explain what happened and how I was specifically told I could go back to it at any time, and was told in nicer terms \"tough shit, can't do much, whoever told you that was wrong because now your case expired and we can't help you anymore in the future\". It was the very same person. Thank you Nintendo for lying to my face. Thanks to you I didn't spend time engaging in your online products because my joy-cons were absolutely unplayable, so you lost more with my one case than all the money you saved by deleting pages left and right for saving money.",

The Switch hardware was rushed because of the Wii U failure. \n\nIt would just cost a lot more to acknowledge it publicly and they would need to design and develop a new joycon from the ground up and replace hundreds of millions of units. That's just not something that would realistically happen - same reason Microsoft just kept taking in RROD units and replacing them.\n\nThere will be a new generation of Switch console in 2-3 years probably so they are just bide their time until then and keep repairing Joycons people send in.",

As if that hasn\u2019t been a core ARPG staple for decades. \n\nIt was very confusing to read. I\u2019m not sure if it was written by AI but it sure felt like it at times.",

It's created by a self-described AAA studio with 100+ devs and published by a huge (EA) publisher - it's certainly AAA in terms of publisher and developer, however I can't see anything about how much it cost which is usually the main indicator. However it does seem to be a mainstream, advertised release funded by EA and is on EA Play Pro so I suspect it's not cheap",

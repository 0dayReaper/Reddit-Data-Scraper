Gameplay we'll have to reserve judgement, but it doesn't look like anything wildly exciting. The prospect of drab, mediocre games skinned with movies I love makes me a sad panda.",

            "comment": "I really liked Terminator: Resistance, and I think I'll really like this. But one thing I do notice is that RoboCop as an FPS game has conceptual issues in terms of being faithful to the early movies while being entertaining. Classic RoboCop walks really slowly, points his gun, fires. That's it. That's the character. To be fair, the concept for the character before the film was shot was that he would be capable of running really fast, but that didn't make any appearance in film until the 2014 remake. And this game is trying to capture the mood of RoboCop 1-3, but primarily 1-2.\n\nThey prototyped the combat mechanics in the DLC for Resistance \"Infiltrator Mode\", but they seem a little more refined here.\n\nThey're clearly trying to compensate by having a bigger focus on RoboCop as a police officer, not RoboCop as a shooter. It's more about finding evidence, interrogating people for information, doing sidequests, and sometimes you shoot people. Hopefully the quests are varied enough, and the writing is strong enough to carry the game across its length.",

He plays it like a tiny little MechWarrior.",

It's a shame so many games cram the post-processing work into the TAA work so you lose lighting effects if TAA is off (looking at you Midnight Suns).",

The enemies all appear completely braindead. They stand out in the open exchanging fire with a walking tank and then get mowed down. Once or twice I saw a couple take cover, but that was very limited, and they were blasted as soon as they dared to pop their head up because everyone else was already downed.\n\nEven the narrator on the video notes how nobody was really a threat. You move slowly, they shoot you, you barely notice. In later levels it's possible that there will be so many enemies that it's a battle of attrition where they wear down your armor and chassis, but in what RoboCop media has there been *that many* disposable criminals that you just wade through. This isn't *Dynasty Warriors*.\n\nSo, based on what we've been shown, I'm not optimistic for a compelling experience, but would love to be wrong.",

So, you're practically invincible *and* you move like a slug *and* you can't really do much cool apart from maybe some targeting upgrades on your gun *and* you don't have to use any tactical concepts in order to win a firefight because enemies won't even take cover, they'll gladly get blown away like the most irrationally loyal street-level thugs in existence.

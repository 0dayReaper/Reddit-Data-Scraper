A year later, I\u2019m still not phenomenal, but I can now do more advanced things like anchor turn, harpoon a rock and fling the ship around it, etc.\n\nCannon fire is basically something you just develop a feel for over time. Once you just start knowing how the physics works without having to actively think about it is when you start landing shots well. I\u2019m still not great at it, but I\u2019m not terrible anymore.\n\nSoloing is still hardmode. If I\u2019m outnumbered I can\u2019t win, but at least now I feel like I can usually escape or at least be more of a pain in the ass than the stuff on my ship is worth before I get sunk.",

That said, for me latest season (season nine) has made solo play a lot more fun. They've scaled forts and world encounters like megs (sharks) and ai ships so you actually stand a chance as a solo player. \n\nIf you do want to check it out, I recommend joining the SoT Discord channel! Even though solo play is great, the LFG there is active (and there is one specifically for beginners/returning players) and it's nice to have some people show you what the game is capable of.\n\nI think SoT's biggest issue is that it doesn't explain what you can actually do in the game so it's very much you loading in and then thinking 'okay what now?' but there actually is tons of stuff. Also, and this is completely personal of course, as someone who HATES the open world PvP because I just want to sail around, the on-demand PvP (Factions) is actually super fun to play",

The best analogy I heard is that soloing isn\u2019t a pirate game, it\u2019s a smuggler game. You can solo all PvE, 1v1 PvP, and can often escape a 1v2+ PvP, but you\u2019re playing a smuggler game for the most part where you\u2019re trying not to be seen or get caught. When you duo, you still don\u2019t want to get ambushed, but you\u2019re less worried about it since you and your partner can split ship duties.",

The learning curve and skill ceiling, even just to sail a solo sloop, are high. You\u2019ll have to spend at least week or so getting comfortable solo sailing a sloop and learning basic mechanics. Interacting with the game is somewhere between sailing simulation and video gamey. Like, you have to raise and lower anchors, the ships turn slower than you think they will, you have to adjust your sails, but also your ship is basically magical and always goes forward, even if the wind is against you.\n\nAlso, Tall Tales aren\u2019t entirely instanced. Some are, some aren\u2019t. The final Pirates of the Caribbean mission, for instance, is at the bottom of the regular world map where other players sailing by can see you and come fuck with you if they want.\n\nBut: the game is amazing. It\u2019s also really technically impressive (joking about bugs and hitreg aside). It\u2019s the most emergent gameplay game I\u2019ve ever played, people pull off wild shit in this game. PvP in this game takes a long time to get good at, and it\u2019s sometimes unavoidable if other players catch you. There\u2019s no power progress though, so the only difference between you and a veteran is player skill.",

                    "comment": "Sort of. The game\u2019s story content, Tall Tales, are usually immediately accessible and you can jump right in. But the game has a pretty high learning curve and skill ceiling, so even if you just go right to the Monkey Island stuff, you\u2019ll just keep crashing your ship for a few days and you\u2019ll likely have to go out into the regular world at some point and potentially get fucked with by other players. You won\u2019t have any loot to lose, but you\u2019ll lose some time when you respawn and have to sail back to whatever you were doing.\n\nThe game is amazing, I\u2019ve pretty much never been so impressed with a game before. But it took *a while* to get comfortable playing it, and even more time to even just get mediocre at it.",

I never got very far but I just loved the vibe of the game and was kinda obsessed with the series. Played the rest of the series years later, and mannn it was good. My fav \u2018\u2019type of games\u2019\u2019, those that just feel like passion projects. Loved the latest game too.\n\nAnyways; Getting to revisit Monkey Island in 3D again is gonna be so special for me - with actual 1st person exploration!! Hopefully they focus on vibe and humor over fights etc. tho. Don\u2019t like the combat in SoT.\n\nIdk why this feels so huge for me. Guess the only unfortunate thing is that SoT will basically peak for me with this. It can\u2019t go anywhere better, this is the best.",

It's up there with No Man's Sky and Fallout 76 in the \"used to be shit, but the Devs listened to the players and pumped out constant updates and fixes\" category.  Almost everything the player base has asked for, they've given us (unless it would break the game or go outside the spirit of the game), and it's come alongside piles and piles of new game content.  \n\nIf you have Game Pass, it's included.

Technically speaking this is the **30th** expansion, but that's not that useful of a description. Some have been huge, many are just a couple dungeons; some are free and have been rolled into the base game now, others are included in the subscription, and some must be purchased. But there's a ton of content no matter how you look at it.",

The new class, Arcanist is the first class they've put out that I genuinely enjoy. The new zone is also exceptionally nice. So far, this feels like the first time I won't drop the game after a month. Your milage may vary, but I'm liking it so far.",

In fact, if you're using a particular skill, you really... *can't*. It's this large beam attack skill that does AoE damage and that feels nice to use. The class actually has decent animations as well. \n\nWhen I first picked it up I attempted to light attack weave and I genuinely think I was worse off doing so. If any of that sounds like problems you had, I think Arcanist might be up your alley.",

Zone design has a excellent, with the art direction bridging the gap where the graphics may otherwise be dated. \n\nExceptional writing for many zones, with recurring characters that appropriately reference your past together (if you have one). \n\nVery modular and open ended, so it ranks as one of the few MMOs where you can kinda play how you want.",

It does have a few good Elder Scrolls stories, but a lot of bad as well and imo the bad outweighs the good in terms of writing/story. \n\nand yes, the gameplay is really as bad as people say in every ESO thread... this game already had an engine that was already dated when it first released back in 2014, and it's only gotten worse since then from bugs to horrible animations to bad classes to poor gameplay design and so on. \n\nAnd it's an MMO, so it comes with a lot of MMO trappings and such which can be good or bad depending on what you're looking for, but even for an MMO it's got a lot of issues both in PvE and PvP.\n\non that note, ESO has one of the worst cash shops in any western MMO and the pricing structure of the game isn't great. Sure it has no monthly sub, which is good, but so much of the game is paywalled and it's made worse with how much shit is on the cash shop.",

Everything is voice acted, world/quests react to you, and there's just so much to explore and eat up.\n\nHowever, the combat is a bit hard to get over, a lot of the melee weapons feel floaty. If you're just playing for story though, that doesn't matter too much.",

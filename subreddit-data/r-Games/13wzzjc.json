I assumed she'd have it as well and I'm glad to see that's the case.\n\nMarisa's made me do a double take because of how different it was and being unlike anything I expected, but it's actually quite good. Her and JP look immaculate.\n\nLuke's is *almost* good but the dumb hat ruins it.",

Not only was that incredibly grindy to do, and only more so with time, but I'm pretty sure between the battle costume, story costume, and nostalgia costume, nostalgia costumes were real money only. I swear they weren't *all* unlockable with FM. Fact is that unless there's a massive grind in World Tour for these outfits, this is an almost undeniably better system.\n\nEdit: Yeah I looked it up, nostalgia costumes were real money only ya goober. Some other classic costumes were FM in that Menat fortune thing but that was only a handful. I think only story outfits cost in-game currency, every other costume had to be bought with cash. I'll admit, the characters likely not being earnable with in-game currency is a downgrade but that's another conversation.",

If you were pretty good at fighting games you can go on trials knock down 10 trials (which a every character has, plus additional 2-4 trials every season) and get enough money to buy 2 skins. And if you knock down 30 you can get a character entirely for free. (That's how I got Rose and Oro) with the base 16 roster and trials you can get all of season 1 for free. (And if you have the champion edition you wont need to buy anything else) while it can feel grindy if you're new to fighters, if you're pretty good it was very beneficial",

It worked - the game doesn't look like much else around - but that also meant banana hair.",

Giant swaths of the cast are missing core tools for their gameplan, and not a single character has options in terms of playstyle.  IT. REALLY. IS. THAT. BAD.   \nAnd the horrendous character models, facial details, and the exceptionally awful hair are all a result of that halfassedness.  You can do good hair with cranked saturation, hell there is some really kickass stuff you can *only* pull off with hair with totally cranked saturation (see  some of the JoJo's Bizzare adventures art).  \nDon't make excuses for them or pretend their shitty product was just an unfortunate side effect from a clever design choice.  \n  \nSF5 was poorly made.  It was a bad game, and in punishment for it's art crimes we should forget it ever existed and speak of it's atrocities no more than necesarry outside the hague, where the responsible parties should be held accountable for that which they inflicted upon a community undeserving of their brutal ocular ministrations.",

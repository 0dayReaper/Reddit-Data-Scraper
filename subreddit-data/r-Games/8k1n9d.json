I know people do dump a lot into fight stick controllers because of the buttons etc, maybe these are high quality.\n\nDoes anyone know if the data over the 3.5mm jack is an actual protocol or really just voltage-on-off/pwm? \n\nIf it's just CV I'd encourage any parents put off by the cost or disabled people with some fine motor control to look into building your own. I'm sure the custom fight stick/controller community has a lot of guides on where to get parts from and getting the basics down. Those plastic cases used to be cheap ready made things as a kid that you'd just drill holes in to mount your switches etc, I'm sure those are still around or you could eventually get things 3d printed and shipped to you. Hell even cardboard can be used depending on the wear expected.\n\nAdafruit has arcade buttons (with LEDs in them!) for $2.50 a piece or $5 for 60mm buttons, probably has cases too, bulk discounts, etc. You could probably get enough bits for 5-6 buttons for the price of one at that other URL linked. There are some more specialised stuff like the bite switch but even that could be DIY'd with a force sensitive resistor or sheet.\n\nI'd hope that some kind of Arduino/OpenBionics style company might come along and try to shake up the space if possible with some really cheap mildly DIY solutions (jumper cables, no soldering, clip together \"controller lego\" etc).",

Ever since Sony began charging for online I've found that Microsoft's services are fundamentally superior.\n\nNamely, as a primarily PC gamer, the offer to buy digitally on XBox and play on PC is very appealing. The majority of Playstation 4 exclusives also don't interest me and I end up playing mostly multiplatform games anyway.\n\nI also use the console as kind of a DRM dump. If something comes out with Denuvo on PC and I still want to play it, I'll just get it on console instead.",

No Cross\\-Buy seemed kinda stupid to me but it wasn't that big a deal, just an odd curiousity. I used to think exclusives were not really that big of a deal; you got a little of something unique on your platform, but I didn't think they really moved systems themselves that much. I have a well\\-worn X360 Elite sitting in my entertainment center even, though the power supply was disconnected and put away because I needed the outlet for something else.\n\nBut then Monster Hunter World happened, and I had enough of an itch to buy one of the two consoles that could play it. My decision was almost completely informed by \"Which console could I get the most value out of in addition to MH.\" Then it came down to: I can play Gears of War on my PC \\(though I've never redeemed the code I got with my videocard\\). I can play Halo 5 something on my PC, but again I never have. But I could play Bloodborne and Horizon on PS4, so I got a PS4.\n\ntl;dr: I didn't think exclusives mattered until I got back into 'this gen' consoles. The lack of exclusives that weren't available on PC is what tipped my purchase.",

Launch devices weren't able to get WP8 which really turned me off and broken my trust in the platform. \n\nThose Lumia phones were sexy.

No matter how marginal the console might be (outside the US here, it feels as if there's only a Playstation and a Switch on the market, the whole idea of a Microsoft console is largely absent), damn that guy has the right attitude. And in this particular case I far prefer this attitude to a strong business focus :o\n\nI hope people *do* actually pick him up on it.

Sony focused on games and that\u2019s what MS needs to do because I honestly can\u2019t think of a system selling game that MS has. Not that gears, halo, or forza aren\u2019t good, they just aren\u2019t exciting enough anymore to be a real system seller. \n\nI do hope they continue down this direction though, because one day they\u2019ll get the mix of games and innovation right and create something amazing.

It is filling a niche and giving people back something they lost. The money is to keep the project sustained and cover there costs. It isn't made for profits sake.

I was an avid gamer before and also enjoyed gaming with my kids, playing mainly FPS myself and stuff like minecraft with them.\n\nNowadays I'm limited to games I can easily control with my mouse, like civilization. I have looked into stuff like the quad stick but the price point and availability here in Europe as well as not being sure if it's actually for me has made me reluctant to buy something so far. This adaptive controller looks very promising to me though, and I will follow this development closely.\n\nI would love to game with my boys again!",

The sheer excitement of getting to see the newest iteration of a Zelda title, and the inevitable frustration and disappointment they must experience knowing that simply picking up and using the controller will present more of a struggle to them than any game ever could. I've never experienced the empathy for them that I do now simply because... I've never been challenged to.\n\nBravo, for addressing a need that has existed since Pong entered our living rooms decades ago, a need that has been plainly staring us in the face for just as long.\n\nBravo, for creating an interface so adaptable that it can be molded and adjusted to fit most (perhaps even all) disabilities that exist.\n\nBravo, for getting me to reexamine my thinking, for changing the way I perceive the members of the video game community, for forcing me to widen my gaze simply because...

As a teenager it used to really piss me off as it often caught me out, so I'd make it my mission to absolutely ruin the guy for the rest of the round. He'd never respond to any shit talk either. Just the occasional smiley face. It took a lot of work to get him to quit too, he'd just keep repeating the same thing over and over, with small variations.  \n\nThe game had quite a small but really dedicated online community. You'd see him fairly often, and a lot of the time the servers became late night chat rooms with people mucking about.  \nAfter many months of playing, I found out from other player that this guy was actually disabled, and walking to a spot and planting a C4 and waiting was about all he could do. It also explained why he couldn't reply back.  \nAfter I learned that I celebrated getting liquefied by him, and would change to his team and watch his back while we both locked down a flag room if I wanted to play a bit of defence. Never really spoke to him, but I think I secretly admired his persistence and resilience, even before I knew about his limitations.  \nThat, plus growing up a bit, made me think twice about getting too worked up over 'campers'. If they look like they move with some difficulty, and keep going to the same spot using an easy weapon, the chances are they're already working harder than you are to play, even if it looks like they're not.  \nNice work, Microsoft. If I ever ended up in a similar situation, I think I'd spend my time living in more interesting worlds too.  \nAnything that can help people with motor control issues get on a level playing field is an excellent thing.  \nRoll on brain interfaces.",

            "comment": "I got invited into one of the closed beta tests for this. The game ran perfectly fine with no bugs or anything, but christ its boring.\n\nImagine Assassins Creed Black Flag, but instead of having a capable ship you slowly upgrade through the game, you only start with a small 3 man ship and have to play for like 20 hours just to unlock the Black Flag ship. Each time you get a new ship you also need to get guns for it.\n\nIts just one long grind of a game that never actually gets fun. It doesn't innovate on Black Flag in any good way, its just that game but with worse progression.",

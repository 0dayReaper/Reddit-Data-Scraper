Fantastic roguelite shooter and probably the closest thing I've found to a \"spiritual successor\" feeling type of game to Nuclear Throne as a huge NT fan haha (even though it does a lot of cool unique things on its own). Looking forward to diving back in for the 1.0 release :)",

The graphics, music, and gameplay are all top notch and while it definitely wears its Nuclear Throne/Gungeon inspiration on it's sleeve it also has so much more to it that makes it incredibly unique. I absolutely reccomend picking it up as it was easily worth the asking price in Early Access alone.",

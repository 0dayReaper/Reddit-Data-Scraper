It lives on in roleplay servers and is almost always in the top 10 games being viewed on Twitch. \n\nPlayers play the cops and criminals spend real life time in prison when caught. \nThe servers have custom mechanics to allow you to do things like rob banks, sell drugs and force you to lockpick cars to steal them. \n\nThere are mechanics to prevent you from from doing things like buying anything larger than a pistol from the gun store, which you need a license (that can be taken away if you are caught commiting a violent crime) to buy as well. You can still get rifles and such, but you need to know the right people and get in with the right gang.\n\nInstead of grinding for money you see a lot more people create characters and try to fill a role. There is a lot more social drama and power struggles between the gangs with the police found in the middle. It's impossible to describe in 1 comment.",

It was delayed multiple times and even saw several anonymous R\\* workers complain about how poorly it was all handled. R\\* provided multiple reasons for why RDR1 never came to PC (or saw an HD remaster) despite fans begging for it, but it basically all came down to A) The game's development was a fucking mess and B) R\\* laid off around 40 people from R\\* San Diego so a lot of the people who made RDR1 barely work in the first place were no longer available.",

It sucks when there's a great title on console that I can't play, but it's easy enough to understand why they're doing it.  I've got no problems with Ubisoft or EA keeping their exclusives on their platforms, after all, they funded them.\n\nNo one benefits from Epic buying the rights to a game after production has finished in the months before its release.  They aren't *creating* exclusives, **they're forcing already non-exclusive titles to become exclusive with absolutely zero benefit to the consumer.**  \n\nIt's actually an exclusively negative impact if you consider the lack of security on EGS at launch and the further splitting up of one's library.",

So I would think chances it won't be Epic exclusive are very slim - unless Epic runs out of cash and I think exclusivity for a game like Death Stranding (especially if turns out to be as good as it is hyped) won't come cheap. Look at RDR2, they barely managed to secure a 1-month exclusivity and even that I guess cost them a fuckton of money.",

If no one wants to play it after the initial PS4 impressions, the PC version would definitely not be the way to go. It's a bit of a gamble.\n\nHonestly that just sounds like more of a reason to wait.

For the record I never went round down voting people (who has time for all that?), but the reason I was convinced Death Stranding was never going to come to PC is that, as well as Sony helping Kojima set up his new studio, the game is being developed using Guerrilla's (who are owned by Sony) Decima engine; a proprietary engine designed specifically for development on PS4, so as far as I'm concerned this really is an unprecedented move.\n\nPersonally I'll still be picking up the PS4 version but this is great news for PC owners... I just hope it's not an EGS exclusive so it avoids all that drama.",

And in the time since then, so much evidence pointed to the game coming to PC. Yet you would not believe how virulently some people were opposed to this idea. Talking about the PC version was basically verboten on the game's subreddit. People who pointed out all the evidence that Death Stranding was a PS4/PC title often got downvoted into the ground. So much anger and bitterness and denial.\n\nI told y'all this was gonna happen. So many people stuck their fingers in their ears and denied it. But it was so obvious. Kojima has always been hugely fond of PC. He started out making Microsoft MSX games. He was reportedly the one who pushed for MGS V to be on PC. He does not like being stuck on a single consoles platform. He likes his games being on PC. Whatever deal Sony signed with him for extra funding and publishing stuff and so on, there was no way he was going to drop the PC version.",

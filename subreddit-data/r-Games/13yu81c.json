The studio was shaken to its core when they got fired from KOTOR Remake, and it sounds like they've been floundering since.\n\nAs for why this has happened, it's possible that they're not capable of delivering, or Disney cut them off after botching the highest profile Star Wars remake of all time.\n\nIt's very unfortunate because the restored content is excellent, and it would have been a fantastic bonus for the Switch port. People bought this port on the promise of the restored content being included.",

I read it was worth waiting for.\n\nActually I originally misread the title of this post and thought it had been *released*, not cancelled. I was confused by how pessimistic your comment was in that light. Lol\n\nI played through KOTOR 1 on Switch (after playing it on the OG Xbox back in the day) and was very happy with the release. \n\nI guess I should pick it up Steam or GoG instead.",

Our source says they were told to never say \u201cNo\u201d to him, or to say, \u201cYeah, that will be easy.\u201d They were also told not to mention Force Unleashed\u2019s protagonist, Starkiller. If he\u2019s referred to by George, it will be \u201cthat guy.\u201d The most important rule, much like not feeding a Mogwai after midnight, was \u201cDon\u2019t tell George how the Force works.\u201d\n\n&gt;Red Fly\u2019s representatives arrived at the meeting point early the next day, only to find LucasArts employees rushing Force Unleashed artwork out of the conference room, and replacing it with other Star Wars artworks, including the placement of Sideshow Collectibles statues of Darth Maul and Darth Talon to the table.\n\n&gt;A friendly George Lucas entered the room and was eager to hear the pitch from Red Fly\u2019s creatives. \u201cBefore they could finish their spiel, Lucas cut them off, stood up, walked over to the statues, rotated them to be facing the same direction, pushed them together, and said \u2018They\u2019re friends!\u2019\u201d adds the source. \u201cHe wanted these characters to be friends, and to play off of each other. He talked about the show Burn Notice as a reference point. He likened Darth Maul to Sonny from The Godfather, and he likened Darth Talon to Lauren Bacall. He actually did an impersonation of her. It was supposedly the weirdest impersonation of a \u201940s actress going, \u2018Don\u2019t you know how to whistle? Put your lips together and blow.\u2019\u201d",

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, a remake of a 2003 role-playing game, is delayed indefinitely as developers at Austin, Texas-based Aspyr Media try to figure out what comes next. Aspyr also abruptly fired the game\u2019s art director and design director this month. In a series of meetings throughout July, Aspyr\u2019s two studio heads told employees that the project is on pause and that the company will look for new contracts and development opportunities, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the situation.\nKnights of the Old Republic was to be one of the first modern Star Wars console games released outside of Electronic Arts Inc., which had previously held the exclusive licensing rights. That deal expires in 2023, opening the door for new Star Wars games from outside companies like Aspyr, Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Quantic Dream SA. The game was announced last September and has been in development for nearly three years at Aspyr, which was purchased by Sweden\u2019s Embracer Group AB last year. Aspyr, founded in 1996, was best known as a service shop that brought existing video games to other platforms, such as iOS, including the original Knights of the Old Republic games. On June 30, Aspyr finalized a demo of the game, known as a vertical slice, to show to production partners Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC and Sony Group Corp. The developers were excited about it and felt like they were on track, according to a person familiar with the project, so they were shocked by what happened next. The following week, the company fired design director Brad Prince and art director Jason Minor. Neither responded to requests for comment, but Minor suggested on a social media page that his dismissal was unexpected. Representatives for Aspyr and Embracer didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Aspyr\u2019s studio heads told staff that the vertical slice wasn\u2019t where they wanted it to be and that the project would be paused, according to two people who were in the meeting. One person familiar with the discussions suggested that a disproportionate amount of time and money had gone into the demo and that the project\u2019s current course wasn\u2019t sustainable. Another point of contention may be the timeline. At the outset of development, Aspyr told staff and partners it would release the game by the end of 2022, according to two people familiar with production. Developers said a more realistic target now would be 2025. The fate of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic remains unclear. In May, Embracer announced that Saber Interactive would also join the project. Some at Aspyr believe that Saber, which has mainly been doing outsourcing work for the project, may take it over completely.\"\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-26/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-game-paused-amid-studio-shakeup",

The Yamaha that makes motorcycles (and jetskis) was spun off in the 50s; it's technically a separate company that Yamaha Corporation merely holds large stakes in (but *does not own or control*).\n\nYamaha Corporation is the conglomerate which started off making organs in the 1800s and is still largely known for producing musical instruments in addition to owning other recognizable music brands like Ampeg, Line 6, and Steinberg. They even founded a music school around the same time the motorcycle division spun off into its own company in the 50s. So, while they are very much a zaibatsu and own lots of other non-music related businesses, they still have a strong primary focus in music.\n\nSadly, this means it's unlikely they'd ever put a keyboard on a motorcycle.",

It seems they're capable, but their culture and management was killing them and their projects.\n\nTheir management and culture issues were made very public thanks to Anthem. It would take another level of incompetence to not adequetely address those issues for Dreadwolf, which is why I'm cautiously optimistic.\n\nOne point in their favour is the the Mass Effect Legendary Edition. From what we've seen, they defined a limited scope on what they were going to do with it and only made small exceptions to their goals. It was publically delayed once, which we understand was a larger scope extension to modernise ME1 a bit more, and was well recieved. Overall, it appears to have been a well managed project.",

            "comment": "I like what was shown and it'll be great to have more good quality Star Wars games, but to me some the trailer was a bit underwhelming in terms of what it implies about the scope of the game. I would have liked to have seen things like ship customization, armour/clothing, different weapon choices etc but it sounds like there isn't going to be things like that beyond upgrades as part of the story. Was hoping it would be a little more in-depth than things have implied so far.",

Its Cid and Vincent that I have any uncertainty of (and in another conversation here, I can see the perspective of someone that thinks Yuffie will somehow always stay on a tier of DLC, but I disagree). I fully expect Cait Sith and Red XIII, and really Yuffie. The suspense for me isn't Red XIII nor Yuffie.",

Do a Yuffie and only have him playable in DLC to tease up the third game. Remake/remaster Dirge of Cerberus to release in-between, like Crisis Core.\n\nCurrently, they don't have Yuffie, Red XIII, Cait Sith, Cid, and Vincent, that's 5 not 2. Yuffie in DLC doesn't count as introduced, she was not involved in a main campaign. Red XIII doesn't count as introduced, he was barely a guest, and I'm talking about central playable characters. So until they prove otherwise, I think its very possible that the devs keep one or two characters back, and use 'its a different story with different structure' as the excuse, and to incentivize keeping our wallets open for more.\n\nIt could be as easy as 'Vincent skulks around and haunts your doings, but doesn't join you yet'.\n\nI don't want this, and I also think its very possible we get everyone, but I just consider this company and project is all. They could have done Red XIII playable in Remake (and just more of an endgame/NG+ challenge tool) but they didn't.",

Wonder if they'll introduce him in a DLC similar to Yuffie.\n\nCid is the big one for me,  though. He was my favorite party member in the original.

You can't use items at all, MP isn't regenerated when resting at a bench, and enemies hit *hard.* Basically, it's balanced around every party member being max level, and the player needing to use actual materia strategy to succeed.",

Some stronger bosses can just wipe your party if you aren't buffed, so magnify+barrier or magnify+haste is a solid combo. Revival earrings can be good to use for auto-life. Synergy+relevant element.

The combat felt so weightless outside of commands, the dodge was there but not really that great, and many other small things that just made it mediocre for me. If that system was attached to any other game it would have been shit all over but they got lucky they had such a beloved IP attached to it. And before all the fans get offended over something they didn't make just look around and it's a pretty common complaint about the remake that the combat was not that great.",

I\u2019ll try to explain why I think the combat is so beloved by many rather than downvoting you and saying you\u2019re wrong.\n\nDodging and blocking aren\u2019t nearly as strong in FF7R because the game expects you to take damage. Healing is a huge part of the game, so the damage needs to happen. If dodging was stronger than that would hurt that aspect of the game. Dodges are only meant to be used sparingly during the most obvious incoming attacks. \n\nIt\u2019s like the turn-based FF games in that no one will ever do a no-hit run in FF7R. The party is going to get hit. Final Fantasy combat is (usually) about trading blows. Party management and healing are a huge part of that. \n\nIf your preference in action games is something like Souls or DMC this will all be quite annoying. And to some extent the game is to blame. They put dodging and blocking in their action game! Of course people will try to play it like most other action games. \n\nBut if you can move past that and engage in the more strategic elements of the FF7R combat, I think that can help explain why people like it so much. It\u2019s unique and a lot of fun in a different kind of way.\n\nIt\u2019s also totally understandable for people not to like it like yourself. Your problems with the combat ring true to me, even if they didn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s not for everyone!",

It\u2019s amazing because it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever felt like I was really controlling a party of characters in an action game. Usually I only get that feeling in turn-based games. \n\nIf you can automate the AI to be good/great then the entire combat system\u2019s design has changed. What made FF7R\u2019s gameplay unique would suddenly be gone and it would be like every other action RPG with companions. Meaning you just sit on one character without issue and only switch if you feel like it.\n\nAnd the game balance would have to shift to compensate for the improved AI. Probably more towards purer action like Kingdom Hearts or FF16. Otherwise the game would be too easy and the player could get bored.",

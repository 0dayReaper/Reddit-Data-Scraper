The one and only thing that will change their mind is loss of revenue. That's it.\n\nIt's kind of shocking to me to see so many people saying things like this or \"wow what the hell why would they do this?\" or \"Damn reddit your app is awful and you should be ashamed\"\n\nLike...I don't understand how so many people have spent so long on this site and still dont get how fundamentally awful the Reddit admins are.  They do not care, at all, about you or what you want. You exist soley as a source for the content they can make money off of. They haven't seriously listened to community feedback in years, they won't start now. I'd be shocked if they even read the comments.\n\nThey are completely aware of how disliked nearly all their changes have been over the years. They are aware how hated the app is. It hasn't changed a god damn thing becuase people still kept coming. Reddit boomed because it was an alternative to Digg. When Digg went to shit, people fled to Reddit. Reddit gets away with all their shit in a way Digg didn't becasue theres no alternative to flee to like Digg users fled here.\n\nWithout a meaningful alternative, Reddit has never, *not one single time since the app and the redesign*, had to feel the consequences of their poor or forced design choices. Why would they ever stop?",

They're counting on investors to see the massive upside potential. They're about to monetize the absolute hell out of this website and this change to 3rd party apps is really just the start. It's going to be a slaughter.\n\nAnd while migration attempts to other apps are noble, the truth is those are doomed to fail in the same way all the twitter alternatives are. Not enough user adoption to really tip the scales. Don't get me wrong, it's entirely possible that could happen, but I wouldn't bet on it. If reddit plays their cards right, they'll have people accepting minor changes over time until 2-3 years from now when this site is unrecognizable from its current state. Sort of like how cosmetic stores in $70 games are now the norm and paid battle passes exist while TotalBiscuit is rolling in his grave.",

The advertising value with millions of users is not insignificant. Being in charge of ad serving in-app also means they can avoid adblockers and similar.\n\nThey want people in an official app because that makes them more money, both directly (ads) and indirectly (user data that gets sold to advertisers and/or allows them to charge more for their ads).\n\nThe user experience is entirely irrelevant to them until it impacts profit. Right or wrong, Reddit management has concluded that the loss in user engagement and loss in user count is an acceptable cost to force everyone to be on the official app. If they end up wrong we might see a quiet parring back of the API rates sufficient to allow third party apps to operate, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nNone of this would be happening if smartphones weren't such a rich environment for user data that companies have found to be incredibly valuable. Apple and Google need to do a major clamp down on the visibility of user data to apps, even seemingly innocuous stuff like wifi SSID. Apple has taken some steps there but it's only steps. Google hasn't and I doubt they ever will, as that user data collection for advertising is in effect their entire business.",

Management would worry that cutting off the apps would outright lose a significant portion of mobile users and would instead look to a compromise like requiring reddit-generated ads to be displayed in the third-party apps without Gold login. The fact is that the reddit official app has 10x as many downloads in the Play Store as all the third parties combined. Where Apollo is #9 in the App Store for News, reddit Official is #2. The vast majority of mobile users are already in the official channel, and reddit is taking the opportunity to juice their metrics ever so slightly for a few months before IPO while simultaneously crushing the possibility that one of those third parties regains control of the mobile experience.",

Reddit wants you to scroll through video posts the same way you would scroll through TikTok. It is so laughably terrible, and a pathetic fellow kids attempt to copy TikTok.

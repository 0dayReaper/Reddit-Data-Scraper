I am not really sure what the gameplay actually entails.\n\nIn the game's description it refers to itself as a 'narrative-driven adventure RPG featuring open-world exploration, stunt-infused racing, and explosive vehicular combat!'\n\nIf anything it sounds more like that Id game Rage from 2011 than Redline.",

Cool to have a driving game setting that isn\u2019t either realistic professional motorsport league, dudebro fist bumping street racer, or zoomer car festival, plus RPG elements and car combat when there aren\u2019t many options for car combat games anymore.\n\nI\u2019m curious if there will be more than one car that the player can drive, even if there\u2019s only 5 or 10 different ones, just for variety.  Driving a truck to trade off mobility to be able to hit harder, that sort of thing.  It felt like the car was almost a main character as much as the person you play as.\n\nWill combat be physics based, or more about whittling down health bars?  And what will the desert open world be like?  Doesn\u2019t seem like the sort of game where you\u2019ll be staying in paved roads all the time, so is it mostly going to be open sandy desert, or what sort of points of interest might there be?",

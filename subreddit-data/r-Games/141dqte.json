SFV was practically rushed out the door, with promises of a story mode and arcade modes being added in the future. Then you have SF6, which has an entire fucking city in what feels like a love letter mishmash between Yakuza and Street Fighter.\n\nCapcom\u2019s new gimmick is that they make great games now, and I love it.",

Play patient in the knowledge that if you keep walking them back because they fear your huge attacks and grabs, eventually they will have to try something risky to get out, and that's when the fun begins.",

The poor critical response absolutely informed the shift in perspective for RE7, but it wasn't like DmC where franchise sales completely cratered.

The consensus is that modern controls kinda carry you up to a certain rank (like platinum) but then you have to actually invest more time into the deeper concepts of the game like mixups, conditioning, footsies, spacing etc.\n\nA \"casual\" Player might get to platinum now, but instead of being gatekept by combo execution they will probably Hit a wall when they have to actually work on higher gameplay concepts and mental Stack.\n\nSo instead of losing the casual players after a Few weeks in bronce, you now will Lose them after a Few weeks in platinum. At least thats what im afraid of. Its a cool System to get more people to play, but so far its basically Just a crutch to get a little bit of a higher rank, its Not a Tool that actually helps you get better at fighting games",

It's just not fun to do. But the main reason why I think that's the case for so many new players like me is that they haven't had a chance to have fun yet. When you're a lot more invested in a game, spending some time practicing is a lot easier of an ask. Having your *first* hour in a game being spent in a practice room is just going to be much more boring than spending your 100th hour in a game in a practice room. And I experienced this myself when I unlocked my 5th special move slot in World Tour, (Which requires you to start doing classic inputs) and after flubbing the input for a bit I was like \"Man I wish WT had some kind of practice room to try out this input more\"",

With Modern Controls and imo even more importantly World Tour, a new player is far more likely to spend a lot longer playing SF6 than any other fighting game. I know that's true for me already and we're only a couple days into it (and yes that includes smash).\n\nThe lack of a well-thought-out single player mode and the high difficulty wall of execution meant that most players were struggling before they were even inside the door. So they couldn't even really test themselves on whether they could even comprehend the fundamentals let alone more advanced fg concepts. \n\nAnd that's the thing, while there are a lot of fighting game concepts that are super hard to wrap your mind around, a lot of them really aren't. It doesn't take a genius to understand concepts like Whiff Punishing or that you can bypass a throw with a block. A lot of these concepts could probably be learned very naturally through gameplay. The problem was that new players weren't playing the game, they were fighting the controls; and the in-game resources to get better were awful. \n\nSo I feel like you can still give pretty significant credit to Modern because it's the difference between a player giving up on their first play session and just never playing again, and a player actually playing enough to win a few matches and feel the drive to get better.",

There are casual players who will never put in more effort than just turning on the game and messing around with Modern controls.  That said, I think the long term goal of Modern controls is to get people to buy-in long enough to care to learn the other aspects of the game.  That choice is still going to 100% be up to the player to care to do that. The longer they had fun jacking with Modern controls in lower ranks, the higher chance they might care to put in more effort.  Will everyone do that?  Not even close.  But, it'll be a higher % than if they didn't have Modern controls imo.",

Giving people who don't want to ever learn the ability to hang with people who actually put in a lot of effort into learning the game is a terrible idea. And I'm not being elitist by saying this.\n\nPlus, people who make the argument \"just get better, it's not at top level\" are dumb. Think about it like this. Imagine if there was an option in Counterstrike where you could make the gun auto aim if you are kinda close, but it does half damage. Yeah, CS pros wouldn't ever use it. Yes, you can say \"well just get better and it's not an issue, or just use it yourself!!!!\". But that doesn't change the fact that you are taking the main skill of the game, the main part that people find fun, and allowing an option that lets other people just skip over it. All to appeal to people who won't play the game in a month.",

Theres a skill ceiling with modern controls.

Grapplers have command grabs. Which are moves that grab an opponent for big damage.\n\nThe inputs are classically a full circle. It\u2019s not just an input complexity thing. You want big damage moves to be balanced around fitting an actual physical movement in.\n\nModern controls make that move one button. Forget classic or modern being better or worse. Knowing someone has a one button command grab changes how you play neutral.\n\nSo it\u2019s not about thinking it\u2019s unfair to lose to modern control players (it\u2019s not). It\u2019s that it changes the game. Personally I fully support fighting games making accessible control schemes. I hope everyone tries out modern. But making certain moves a single input with only a damage nerf isn\u2019t good enough balance to me\n\n\nTLDR: one button supers, command grabs, and punishes change neutral. Changing the rules of neutral rubs people the wrong way.",

I also just tested it, and Zangief only ever gets heavy SPD, which is the one with the worst range.  Even if you do the motion input for it, you still have an 80% damage penalty.  It will still change how you play neutral sometimes, sure, but if you're that close to Zangief, SPD is already an enormous threat at any time.",

Going back to my example - you can say that the main skills of Counterstrike are positioning, getting good looks, predicting where they will be, having a cohesive strategy, and so on. But that doesn't change the fact that even with the best map awareness, correct purchasing decisions, best team cohesion, you still have to aim. And people find getting better at aiming fun, that's why they play shooters. If you allowed people to skip that step, you are telling people who have put in all of that time into something they enjoy that their skills aren't appreciated. You are telling people that a part of the game they loved doing doesn't matter as much because people who don't want to try should get to win too.\n\nStreet Fighter is not a game solely decided by the decisions you make in neutral. It shouldn't be. If I wanted to play a game that was just about out deciding the opponent I would play rock paper scissors.",

There's still combo execution in modern controls besides the small ones they hand to you, and more combos beyond that are locked out unless they want to move up to classic.  The difference between Street Fighter and rock, paper, scissors is not \"combos\".  Quite frankly, if you love combos, Street Fighter is the wrong fighting game for you.\n\nAnd we used to have more multiplayer shooters where aiming was far less emphasized, like Doom and Goldeneye, and I hope we get more of those some day, because a game primarily about positioning, prediction, and strategy without much emphasis on aiming can still be incredibly fun.  To plenty of people, even preferable.",

The auto combos on most characters are very simple strings into supers that even newcomers could learn to pull off reliably in classic in like ~10-15 mins. They aren't even optimal!\n\nOf course you're still rewarded for \"learning the game\". A good Classic user will destroy a bad Modern user because they have no idea how spacing works, how to use their Drive bar, how to properly punish, etc. \n\nIronically the only meaningful change that Modern has brought is at higher levels of play - not because of auto combo (which is useless) but because of one button/instant specials.",

The game is not just a mental game.\n\nA good counterstrike player in my hypothetical would still beat a half damage auto aimer. But you cannot *ONLY* look at high level when deciding if a mechanic is good. At the level most people play at, modern ends up being better than classic and the skills of being good at fighting games (or in my example, the skill of knowing how to aim) ends up not mattering nearly as much as it should. And I don't find that very fun.",

I think there are still some issues with it, although some of those are kind of inevitable (basically some of them come from the fact that they need classic controls to still exist and be competitive, which kind of forces them to put some limitations on modern controls that I really dislike).  But they still do a great job letting people who don't want to deal with the execution barrier or learning curve of classic controls e competitive without feeling like switching to classic eventually, while still having tradeoffs that make classic controls feel rewarding for people who use them.\n\nHonestly the only real big issue with modern is just the way they kind of try to force them on you at times, most notably with the lack of an obvious \"please just always default me to classic controls in all contexts\" setting.  It is kind of annoying for people who know they want to use classic controls that there are control settings in a bunch of different places that all default to modern so it's easy to think you've gotten them all and then try a new mode or character and find yourself in modern controls again.",

So you get to know  them better and they teach you new moves.\n\nIt's kind of casual fun. But if you're not interested in learning about the Street Fighter lore and characters I'm not sure it will be that compelling.\n\nKind of the same way Yakuza 1, without the story, would just be a few fights.",

There's been pictures of new people posting their lose streaks on r/streetfighter, not out of frustration but more as a display of tenacity/solidarity, but then you see all their matches have been in Casual/Battlehub.  \n\nI'm pretty bad, but ranked has been good at placing me in an appropriate spot for even matches, and it's even per character so I don't feel bad/punished for trying new characters.

Not to mention World Tour does a wonderful job at introducing me to the fundamentals. Fighting games have also felt like this massive wall to me, but SF6 has given me the tools to climb the wall at a reasonable pace while also giving me plenty of points to just take a breath.\n\nIt's really remarkable how well Capcom has made a fighting game for people who don't play fighters as well as fighting enthusiasts",

A lot of people talk about modern controles without knowing much about them like saying \"20% damage reduction\" without knowing that manually inputting the special with the classic command is possible with modern controles, which gives you the normal damage. Yes some moves will get cut, but not all characters are hurt equally by that. I would argue that at like Iron-Platinum modern controles are actually better because you dont mess up your inptus, combos and anti airs as much like newer players would with classic controles. \n\nOn top of that there are extremly big advantages to using modern controles even in a professional play, like faster DP\u00b4s and on button supers, which allow you to punish stuff way easier and harder",

Casual players often call for nerfs for characters they have a hard time dealing with, which results in archetypes like grapplers sometimes getting nerfs when they're already barely viable. Games like Overwatch are a different story because you have access to all of a character's tools at all skill levels, in fighting games low and even mid level play may as well be different games because players just don't know how to properly use the kit of the characters (which is why some characters like grapplers often seem incredibly strong while others like zoners or glass cannons seem really weak at low levels, but at high levels the opposite is true).\n\nIf anything, the sanding down of interesting parts in the genre have come from wanting to please casual audiences, not because they were trying to appeal to pros. Case in point, SFV being an incredibly uninteresting game competitively at the start because they removed so much stuff in an attempt to make it easier.",

You choose your fighting game experience level and play a few placement matches, then it seems to do a pretty good job of putting you on the ranked ladder at a skill appropriate level right off the bat.  This does a great job of letting everyone find opponents of similar skill level to get fair matches. \n\n This type of system has been in other competitive video games before, but I haven't really seen it used in fighting games this well before, and I think it will alleviate lot of people's worries about going online and being stomped by experienced players right away.",

They could\u2019ve so easily charged the new gen price, even at least just for the next gen consoles but they didn\u2019t. \n\nThey made an incredibly smart choice with the pricing and I wish more companies used the same tactic. Keep the base edition at the typical $60 USD and then have a deluxe edition which guarantees DLC content at a slightly higher price which is what the hardcore fans will get. Capcom has consistently been making really smart choices especially with SF6",

In a way it almost feels like the audience at large has finally given up at this point and are waving the white flag, or are willing to when it's a really good game that has them.\n\nI'm not going to claim to know exactly how they did Street Fighter V because I've never played it, but it has 5 seasons.  I assume they sold a pass for each season... so like, once again, a single season pass is not enough anymore and there's 5.  It had virtual currency that you could buy, because of course it does.  I'm sure it had cosmetics you could buy, because of course it does.  I'm going to assume 6 has all of this... and more, now that you can create a character and customize/cloth them.  Does 6 not have 2 virtual currencies now in Drive Tickets and Fighter Coins?  I think it has a premium battle pass too?  Like I'm legitimately not able to keep up with this shit anymore... and I'm not really hearing people complaining like they used to years ago.  I'm almost kind of shocked that people are walking into a really nice room full of luxurious decorations and everything's set up real nice, and they're pretending like they don't see the big pile of steaming elephant shit sitting right in the middle of the room.",

Biggest difference is how the in game currency worked, because we were able to purchase DLC characters and other contents by simply playing the game and getting enough fighting money. Worth saying that they stopped to do multiple editions of the same game because of the DLC system, so it's kinda of a net positive for the community since everyone played the same game at the latest balance update without being separated by constant re-releases \n\nBut yeah, game is good and people like the developer so a lot of things that they do get a pass. Capcom added microtransactions to the Resident Evil 4 Remake weeks after launch and they barely got any criticism for it. What would be a PR nightmare for a company like Activision or EA is simply nothing for a studio like Capcom.",

I was an early buyer of Minecraft but never stuck to it because I'm the kind of player who need a point beyond just creative drive and DQB2 has it all. It has an involved storyline, everything you do serves a story purpose, and they give you a free roam island where you can build everything you need from what you earned in the story.\n\nSome internet creations were so intricate and involved your switch would slow down to 5 FPS upon loading it. Thankfully I have the game on PC now haha",

A few of the cutscenes were unintentionally hilarious due to it being obvious they didn't expect players to do that, so you looked from your character's perspective and saw what *they* would have seen, which is surprisingly funny since you don't think about such things in third person. ;P",

I mean, look at Terraria itself, the way that the game grew and expanded over the years, and the way that it reflects on the game progression itself: how you play the game and approach obstacles completely changes as you progress. Even building improves with the tools you acquire. In Minecraft, you pretty much only get *better quality* gear, with a few exceptions.\n\nIn Terraria, everywhere you look, there is a new thing: a new NPC, a new block, a new biome, a new enemy, a new weapon type, a new trinket, a new event, a new mount... It's like a Kaleidoscope of content. And whenever you think you've reached the \"end\" of what it had to give, it comes around with more stuff. \n\nHell, even the **world** itself changes significantly as you play. Terraria's finite world seems *infinitely* more alive than Minecraft *actual infinite* world.\n\nMojang should've had, like, infinite budget to do what modders already do, but with the quality, polish and integration that comes with being the developers, but it seems that Microsoft only bought Mojang to make Minecraft spin-offs...",

The reason the animals are more wild when you first get them is to encourage breeding the wilderness out of them throughout the generations. The reason food spoils is so you have to design your base not just aesthetically, but practically as well with a cellar that has minimal natural light exposure.\n\nYou should reevaluate many things if you see what is in Vintage Story as bloat, because it is not; bloat is adding a new animal that does nothing but sell plushies to little kids.",

With Primitive Survival, early survival is much easier, making the game less frustrating.\n\nAlso the mod support is fantastic, yeah. The main dev is super helpful and welcomes ideas from the community. I was just a noob wanting to modify the rendering of the map and when he saw my results he directly contacted me and implemented them in the next release.  \n\nStill lacking what I really need, which is actual helpful NPCs, but i really enjoy what they have built :)",

When I get into a VS world it's got double the texture resolution of MC, more detailed/complex models for blocks and mobs, flora with wind flow effects, much prettier lighting (with colored lighting), dynamic weather, and changing seasons. All made by an indie team of a few people with a small budget. \nMeanwhile, whenever I boot up Minecraft at default settings on my SSD I still get stutters or lag spikes and have to download a community performance mod.",

Been playing/watching Hat Films play the Vault Hunters modpack and it's a blast to play. There's plenty of modpacks to choose from as well that can give you all sorts of fun goals. I remember playing one called Project Ozone I think? You basically are tasked with bringing life back to the world through the use of various mods. I stopped playing it eventually because my PC at the time was chugging when I tried to play the pack. Whoops...",

It's cool but it's over very quick and soon enough there's nothing left to do. Mods just add so much more to do and make the game a lot more meaningful imo.

Thaumcraft alone is really cool and gives some much needed purpose to building certain things that I enjoyed a lot.

Terraria is probably one of the best bang for your buck game purchases you can make.\n\nMinecraft is a \"create your own adventure\" with basically nothing to do or progress on if you don't set yourself goals. Its great to play with friends or look at someone else doing something but gets really old the moment you can't share it. It has little extrinsic rewards and I wouldn't call it intrinsically rewarding either. You see many of the big minecraft modpacks trying to \"fix\" this but the default game hasn't really been willing to address it even with what they call \"adventure\" updates.\n\nIn comparison Terraria has clear progression and basically everything is extrinsically rewarding. You have to do things to get better and you actually get better. To me this has always made the game more enjoyable to pick up and play.",

People use \"sandbox\" a lot to describe a lot of games, but Minecraft really is a sandbox. It's an empty box with nothing but sand in it. There is no goal to the sandbox, no objective. There's progression but it's kind of meaningless and only serves to unlock new colors and styles of sand. If you're of one mind, you look at the sandbox and can see the awesome sand castle you're about to make. If you're of another mind, you see a boring square of sand and go over to the tetherball or monkey bars or whatever.\n\nTerraria, on the other hand, has a goal, has a 'genre' - it's an open-world procedurally generated \"survival\" crafting RPG. There is a goal - kill the Moon Lord. There is real progression, not only in terms of numbers but in terms of mechanics - big difference between running around with Hermes Boots and a Musket, versus flying with Solar Wings and a SDMG.",

Minecraft at one point seemed to just stop caring about and instead updates became highly compartmentalised content updates where you'd get a bunch of new stuff in a biome that doesn't really impact anything else.\n\nMinecraft today is also fundamentally different to what it was a decade ago, and I think if you're one of those people whom the newer versions have kind of lost it stings that IMO neither game really scratch that itch now.",

Starbound is sadly a massive failure.  it totally failed to match Terraria's exploration, sandbox, etc.  the worlds are empty and pointless.  it has tacked on story missions which are great as platformers.. but totally fail to mesh with the sandbox digging of the base game.\n'\nIt does have great art, and fantastic character races. the Florians are one of the best races ever created for a  game.\n\nThe RNG systems, also a failure.   RNG weapons, RNG enemies. was a total mistake. rng enemies just ended up all looking exactly the same. no identity.  rng weapons didn't have any real cool effects. nothing memorable like terraria bee guns, sharkminigun, etc..\n\nthe enemy spawning. failure.    Terraria has a brilliant system for enemies to spawn offscreen, and constantly come at you.  Allows farms, etc.  starbound doesn't have that. you can kill everything, and go afk, and be fine.  if you do that in terraria, you die, so you need to build a house for protection first.\n\nMuch of Starbound is a testament to the failure of crowdfunding. lots of promises, they couldn't keep. Either not good enough devs, and failing at tech issues, or having made design promises that weren't fun.. but forced to include because they promised it.",

Even the smallest maps are fairly big. Starbound brings you to a bunch of different worlds, but you can literally run around these worlds in like a minute or two. IMO Terraria simply does everything better, so I went back to Terraria.",

Factorio is a sandbox game yet the player is constantly engaging with various game mechanics of space management, automation, tower defense; the trifecta of logistics: rails, belts and bots all have their upsides and downsides but don't really overshadow the other one in everything; and has a big expansive progression system with its tech tree.\n\nAnd speaking of Minecraft alternatives. If you're a fan of Minecraft tech mods, highly recommend Factorio. In fact minecraft mods inspired the devs to make it.",

I've always had my disagreements with his ideas and we've had many heated moments when we clashed on design but honestly these days, since he's joined Mojang, he has a really strong understanding of what makes Minecraft so broadly beloved. And that's just frankly a different design space compared to something like Terraria. They're different flavours of the same concepts, and appeal differently because of it.\n\nIt saddens me that a lot of the people discussing this stuff seem to think one approach is better than the other, or that Mojang should abandon their approach to appeal to a core set of adventure power users. But I'm glad Andrew is being more nuanced and polite giving his insights around why Terraria is different.\n\nPeople just need to chill out I feel, and maybe appreciate that Minecraft has an incredibly broad user base which means not every addition is going to focus on their chosen gameplay pillar. I also think it's important to understand that the vast VAST majority of Minecraft players are generally happy with, and continue to enjoy, the recent updates. And the general social media narrative around these updates is driven by commentators who actively benefit from stirring up controversy, and generally represent a very niche set of power users who the devs aren't always going to be designing for.\n\nRunning a community in Minecraft (in my case the Aether mod) means constantly battling these bafflingly overblown controversies and negative stories, and constantly having to shoot down outright hatred towards the dev team. Even when said hatred is based on just some random shit someone said on YouTube. But the key thing is that for every one person who parrots some insanely hostile language about the Dev team and the state of the game, there's 100 happy players who just get on and enjoy the game.",

But the problem here is the end-user doesn't care about new command settings, and I'd even argue the biggest thing to come from that patch was making things just a bit easier for modders. But the point still stands that it was billed as a major update akin to entire worldgen changes, new biomes, the height limit being upped, so on and so forth when in reality it has a patchlog thats only like three or four pages and a majority of those are commands and a very small handful of bugfixes (though not like I'm saying there should be a quota of bugfixes and it's good that parts small.)\n\nTo put my views as simply as possible; every major update should be bare-minimum the size of the Nether update, because that was a major update. They have the money, they have or can get the talent, and it's not like they can't afford to get a bit wild with ideas. I'm not asking for total progression overhauls but I'm asking for them to actually start adding new features and blocks to a game that is lucky to get something akin to Piston's or Sponge's once a year.",

I have my own critiques of what Mojang is doing, and I make my issues heard in a respectful and constructive manner. But there being genuine critiques to be voiced does not excuse or justify the level of harassment the Dev team receives on a daily basis. And my point is when people run communities or create content around the game they should try to push back on that. When I've seen the opposite with a lot of communities and content creators stoking the flaming a LOT.\n\nThat said I also think a lot of the criticism comes from a basic misunderstanding of the team's development workflow and responsibilities. When you see people comparing the output of mod developers to the vanilla game I think a lot of people don't understand how those two outcomes aren't often particularly comparable.\n\nBut yeah I think Mojang does a poor job adding content at pace, from what I've seen and heard it's generally because of a couple things. 1) COVID hit the games development HARD and they're still playing catch-up and reintegrating staff into their workflow, we're still on the tail end of the pandemic interrupting development and slowing things down but I expect that to improve in the next few updates. 2) The dev team is also prioritising re-optimising the game and re-engineering a lot of the backend following a few large scale content updates (nether update and caves and cliffs both put a lot of strain on the limitations of the games codebase and we're seeing a lot of positive changes since then, including most recently a full rewrite of the lighting engine) so content production is somewhat deprioritised for 1.19 and 1.20 (and likely 1.21 too from what Ive heard) and 3) The design team is currently in a process of re-evaluating and examining the core design pillars and ideas behind the game since Agnes took over as director. And that means these next few updates have a LOT more design iteration pre-production than some other updates pre-1.13 had. So the process of figuring out what content is going to come through in the next few major updates is taking up more Dev time than before.\n\nNow these aren't excuses for their output, they're just the explanations I have found from talking to people in and around the dev team. I think at it's core a more stable and experienced management team would have been able to account for these workflow problems better, but I think the pandemic, especially how heavily Sweden was affected, has thrown a lot of that off.\n\nIf it doesn't improve in the next year or so I think we have some genuine reason to assume the management at Mojang needs reshuffling. But from my perspective they're putting effort into the right places for the games health right now, and it'll pay off greatly in the near future, but yeah they need to get on a faster work schedule because these updates are too few and far between for most players. Though I would still argue the content within the updates has been stellar and really improved the game significantly.",

Are you a professional programmer? I couldn't tell by the way you talked about the aether experience you have. There's always some good reasons why comparing modding output to Mojang's is misleading, but unfortunately Mojang's output itself isn't far beyond modding itself. \n\n\n&gt; COVID hit the games development HARD and they're still playing catch-up and reintegrating staff into their workflow\n\nRight and why does this still apply years later, when many other software companies have not struggled nearly as hard? \n\n\n&gt; The dev team is also prioritising re-optimising the game and re-engineering a lot of the backend following a few large scale content updates\n\nRight but this is how programming works in general. This isn't something novel, it's continuous so every other company is having to do those things too. Not only that but they have a very long way to go for optimization, still runs bad for me on a good computer. Didn't they refuse to add some stuff from Optifine so they ended up being able to add none of it?\n\n\n &gt; including most recently a full rewrite of the lighting engine\n\nIf this is true, why were they not adding dynamic lighting or lighting colours with this? I have some doubts that the \"lighting engine\" was rewritten without those things being considered. Do you mean the rendering engine, which is different than the lighting?\n\n\n&gt; So the process of figuring out what content is going to come through in the next few major updates is taking up more Dev time than before.\n\nRight but if you look at Mojang's track record, they'll take more time to add less things. It's not that we have been seeing a tradeoff  of quantity for quality, it's a distinct lack of both.\n\n\n\nI do know they are working on some things they aren't allowed to show to the public yet. Mostly related to custom maps/experiences used by the creators of marketplace maps or servers. So there's still a few things taking up their time people can't see.\n\n\nHowever it boils down to the company being very inefficient. Everywhere I've worked has gotten more done with less people, money, and time.",

It's helpful when trying to go in a certain direction (down, left, right, etc) but can go off in corners or odd spots when you're just trying to do random stuff (jump and hit that one gold block, for example). I'd suggest trying to turn it on and off and seeing if that was the issue.  I think it starts off by default but maybe you turned it on by accident?",

I want something that we can co-op together and have some challenges in. They finally started adding \"dungeons\" and PVE combat content, but I still don't think it's what I'd like it to be... yet.",

            "comment": "I feel lile Minecraft is being unfairly attacked, especially in the comments.  I'm glad Minecraft is still a sandbox, and not a game with progression as it's core element.  Terraria and Minecraft don't have to be the same.  Terraria isn't a better \"version\" of Minecraft.  That is a very disingenuous claim and a lot here are saying it.  Terraria was influenced by Minecraft but still managed to carve out its own path.  They're different games.  \n\nI could never get into Terraria.  The 2d aspect does nothing for me.  Just a personal preference.  And I tried getting into it multiple times.  It never took.  I don't doubt that its a wonderful game for those who do get into it. \n\nEverytime Minecraft gets an official update I read comments and the amount of negativity really disturbs me.  Here are a few things I hear often: \n\n- \"We waited this long for so little?  Modders are the only ones adding actual content to the game.\" \n\nMy response: Minecraft is a crazy popular game with a huge conmunity.  The modding community is going to be crazy big with a game this popular.  No amount of devs or money could ever keep up with modders.  That's the most unrealistic expectation in the universe.  Geez its so crazy that thousands of modders manage to outpace how ever many developers there are.  Probably like 100.  \n\n- \"All they ever add are blocks and biomes and a single mob or animal\"\n\nThey also add interactions between all these new blocks and things.  They drop or yield new things, they lead to the creation of new items with new functions.  They're staying true to endless sandbox by incressing our options on what we can do with our imaginations.  How is this bad? Because you're not getting 50 new toys an update? \n\nHave you ever thought that maybe you just don't personally like Minecraft and are wanting it to become a game it isn't? It's OK to not enjoy Minecraft.  Minecraft shouldn't have to change into something it isn't just to pacify all the people who are never happy with anything.  \n\nIMO they DID make Minecraft into a different game with progression to satiate everyone with those criticisms.  They are called Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Legends.  They are giving us completely different styles of games within the world,  allowing Minecraft to stay true to the sandbox game it began as. \n\nI love Minecraft.  As a 38 year old who has stuck with it since release I am happy it hasn't radically transformed into a different game.  Minecraft is a sandbox game at its core.",

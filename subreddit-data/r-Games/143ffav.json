And hey, ripping off I am Legend is fine. It's a highly influential film filled with powerful images. But the problem I have with this is it feels very hollow... like there's nothing under the ripoff.",

Even their own trailers are poor imitations of their previous trailers. It\u2019s hard to even fathom what their strategy is - they don\u2019t seem remotely competent enough to pull off the long con people are accusing them of",

Yet, you can't figure out why they would fire you because you said you would like to do a good job ...one day.",

Game is review bombed on Steam, internet blows up about it for a few days.\n4. Dev posts apology letter to fans, promises to make it right and support the game long term.\n5. Dev makes millions and never fixes the game.\n6. Repeat in a few years with new title.",

They could have cheaped out and only shown a tiny vertical slice. But this proves this unknown shady studio is not only the real deal. They are the future of AAA gaming..",

But the context just makes this so bad. \n\nSeriously, everyone has serious concerns about the legitimacy of this game, its constant delays, their reluctancy to show real gameplay, and then they just out of nowhere drop a 30 second trailer of a sports car driving with a movie trailer voice announcing the release date?\n\nThis doesn't even make it look like a survival game. Awful trailer. \"Best survival experience of the year\" feels like a joke when the trailer DIDN'T SHOW ANY SURVIVAL ELEMENTS.",

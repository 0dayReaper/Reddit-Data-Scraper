    "postText": "Hello!  We're Failbetter Games, and we're glad to be back in r/Games for another launch day AMA!\n\nThis time it's for Mask of the Rose ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769980/Mask_of_the_Rose/), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/mask_of_the_rose), [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/mask-of-the-rose-switch/)), which is a visual novel, but might not be what you expect of the genre. We're known for games rich in choice and consequence, and while we set out to make something simpler than our past work, somehow it ended up with a complex social simulation and huge amount of player freedom?\n\nThe game takes place in Victorian London... a few months after it was dragged beneath the earth by a flock of bats. At the heart of the story is a murder: when the respectable David Landau is poisoned, your housemate Archie is the prime suspect.\n\nDeath works differently in the Neath, though, and when David returns (understandably annoyed) from the grave, the race is on (maybe) to prove Archie's innocence and identify the real murderer.\n\nOr, honestly, you can focus on something else instead. For example:\n\n* Earn money as a census-taker for the shadowy Masters of the Bazaar and ask people weirdly intrusive personal questions.\n* Use the game\u2019s unique storycrafting mechanic to develop theories about the murder, or just help a friend plot out her novels instead.\n* Shape what others think of you by assembling the perfect outfit for any occasion, or confound them with bold and terrible sartorial choices.\n* Or maybe you\u2019d rather concentrate on matters of the heart? Find yourself a date for the city\u2019s first Feast of the Rose. Seek enduring romance, flirt with devils, have a casual fling, focus on aromantic or asexual relationships, or pursue the affections of that mysterious, looming, taloned newcomer...\n\nWith all this, we\u2019re confident every playthrough will be different. And we designed Mask of the Rose with replay in mind: you might uncover the true murderer your first time through, but the why of it is a deeper secret.\n\nHere\u2019s who\u2019ll be answering your questions:\n\nHannah Flynn, Communications Director - u/failbettergames\n\nPaul Arendt, Art Director - u/Paul_Arendt\n\nEmily Short, Creative Director - u/emshortif\n\nJames Chew, Writer - u/jamesstanthony\n\nS\u00e9amus \u00d3 Buadhach\u00e1in, Programmer - u/gallmarch\n\nStuart Young, Producer - u/stuartFBG\n\nWe'll be around for a few hours, as long as the questions are rolling in \u2013 ask us anything about interactive storytelling, making indie games, or of course, Mask of the Rose itself!\n\nEDIT: 2216 BST - Thanks for having us! We'll hoover up any juicy outliers tomorrow, but until then - like inhuman entities out in the dark - we too must slumber.",

Early in the game you get given an Admiral Hat, which I've taken to calling the Asshole Hat, because of what it does to your dialogue options. However I wouldn't go for it on a first playthrough - it does have the consequence of alienating everyone, which can make many of your goals harder or impossible to complete. At it's heart, it's a social sim, so unlike action RPGs where you can compensate for your personality deficiency with carnage, you will need some social capital here. On the other hand, there are some more subtle and morally dubious decisions you can make that lead to unique content.",

The ability to have the camera zoom in on specific things, and optionally blur the background, made a huge difference to how scenes played.\n\nBefore that came in, our main way of keeping visual interest in a long scene was to move the characters horizontally and have them changes poses a lot. Obviously, that's harder with two characters and nearly impossible with three fighting for real estate. So being able to instead move the camera in and out, or put focus on just one, was a revelation.\n\nLikewise, being able to zoom and blur in single character scenes was fantastic when we wanted to signal \"this bit of the conversation is getting more intimate/trusting/personal\".",

And we also had some new ideas, and some new designers on the team. So the energy was good.  \n\n\nBehind the scenes, we did some other work to make things more sustainable. The anniversary push was big but we initially scoped it to end! If we were going to keep going, we needed to approach it differently. That included ongoing (but cumulatively significant) improvements to the tooling, and also some process changes in how we design, plan, and write material -- looking ahead more than we used to, anticipating economy changes over a longer timeline, and that sort of thing. Quite a few of those changes were only possible because of what we learned as a team doing the anniversary work.",

I haven't had a chance to play it yet (I missed the kickstarter to get the key early, but get home in three hours!), but it seems like Mask of the Rose has taken a lot of those ideas and systems and ran with them. So I guess I'd like to ask about some lessons you've learned about writing reactive characters over the years. \n\nAlso, on that note: if you're at liberty to talk about it, can I ask what happened to CharacterAI?",

Pretty much every option you can take with a character in mask is encoded as representing one or more verbs that the player is performing on the character, and that affects their overall opinion of you, their choice of how to react to you, and (due to the choice of reaction) their pose and facial expression. Though it's possible for the author to hand-code expression changes and we did that a lot too (especially when NPCs were talking to one another), we relied heavily on this system throughout the game to drive low-level performance in a juicy way. Often it works when you don't even notice it working -- e.g. letting Griz deliver the exact same line with an amused expression or an annoyed one, based on your prior history with her. \n\nIt was also handy, as an author, to be able to write conditions that boiled down to \"I tell this character a lie. If they believe me, X; if they're dubious, Y; if they call me a liar straight out, Z\", and have the underlying system handle all the history that controlled what the character reaction was going to be.\n\nScenes with a character are also typically put together of several portions -- what do you want to say to them, what do they want to say to you, etc -- and that allows a lot of dynamic remixing depending on plot state. \n\nOne of my favourite experiences with the game in recent months has been opening up playtesting save files, starting a conversation with a character, and having that NPC greet me with affection or a huge attitude depending on where the player landed the storyline before I got there.\n\nAnyway, that's a very limited subset of the full answer, but all I can get into here.",

That helped us find places where we'd made incorrect assumptions about which events ruled out which others.  \n\n\nA somewhat more writerly example: there are a number of key plot scenes that play out  differently depending on what your relationship state is with other characters. But we don't have to know exactly how you got there; we can just test \"are you close to this person\" or \"do they think you're kind\", and the story builds on that without checking for specific beats.",

UI (Mask is an *intensely* UI-heavy game, obviously) and input handling are, unglamorously, the toughest to work on and make feel at least reasonably good. I have a patch of grey hair I attribute solely to the experience of getting a VerticalLayoutGroup and ContentSizeFitter to both update in the same frame.\n* Architecture that unquestionably paid off: we decided right at the start of pre-production to to support gamepad and mouse/keyboard hotswitching and designed everything with that in mind; the system we built was simple and effective and it's one where I think we made the right decisions first time.\n* Architecture that didn't: at a high level, I've got some regrets about how we designed the user interface (I mean purely technical design \u2014 the layout and art are maybe the best we've ever done). I should have bitten the bullet and implemented a *logical* hierarchy for all our widgets (something like Unreal's new CommonUI) right from the start \u2014 since I work on the Fallen London front-end I don't even have ignorance as an excuse! Ah well, there's always next time.\n* A bit of both! We used the built-in Unity test runner extensively for the lower-level subsystems where it was straightforward to do so; I find writing unit tests very soothing. For testing game logic, we did an OK job of separating the data and presentation layer from the start so when it came to automatically running the narrative engine, we built a system that would simulate user intentions rather than direct inputs (if that makes sense). We implemented everything within Unity, though; I wanted us to eat our own dog food to the greatest extent possible.",

The Roof for instance leaps out as being a fairly unexplored area that has a lot of unanswered questions and unexplored potential (beyond the tantalising glimpses we get in stories like Upwards/Written in the Glim/Stretch in the Sky).\n\nI've really enjoyed the chapter by chapter release format that GHR/Evo introduced, as well as the new locations and stories, so I hope we get the opportunity to see more similarly ambitious projects in FL going forward!",

Preview videos of Mask of the Rose, on the other hand, look like it's deliberately leaned away from this mechanical lineage.\n\nTo what extent is that true? Are there places where Storynexus is still a major influence on Mask of the Rose's game mechanical guts? Are there places where you've found it especially important to make a clean break from Fallen London's \"storylet -&gt; branch -&gt; quality check -&gt; success/failure/rare result\" formula?",

Mask of the Rose is written in Ink. From a technical perspective, there is no dependency and none of the StoryNexus codebase was used.\n\nThat said, we did nod to the design heritage of Fallen London in a few ways. Mask of the Rose has a map with locations you gradually open up, and things you can do in those locations. Thinking of those larger-scale scenes as being equivalent to storylets wouldn't be completely off base. They just have a lot more internal complexity.\n\n(If you really want a deep cut that touches on the idea of \"SN-style storylet but with complex branching content inside\", Varytale was a system -- now, alas, defunct -- that did exactly that.)",

Then we tuned it a little more to allow us to pick particular play styles (e.g. \"this time, tell a lot of lies\"), and the writers added their own debug-only hinting to bias the system in particular directions (e.g., \"this time, try to \\[REDACTED\\] the \\[REDACTED\\]\").\n\nWe looked early on at more formal analyses (e.g. building a graph that completely enumerated the possible steps for all choices, outfits, and so on), but some back-of-the-envelope maths showed pretty quickly that this was laughably untractable. It's a very complex game!",

There's no blood--when people get hit there are some lights that light up around them. When they \"die\", they sit down and wave to you and then disappear.  \n\n\nThe Chinese government must think its citizens are 3 years old or plain stupid. When you get shot with a gun enough times, you don't sit down and wave your hands to your opponent.",

The market they're selling to in China is the 200-300 million people that live in the so called fist tier cities, and even there I bet the regional price is set quite a bit lower than it would be in Western countries. Plus you also require a local Chinese \"partner\" if you want to do business in China which means some of the profits will be skimmed by them and even if you ascent to evey demand made by the CCP there is still a chance you do something that annoys them tomorrow and that'll be it, no more access to the Chinese market for you.\n\nNot saying it's not a big enough market to care about, which company doesn't like making more money, but with a few exceptions most companies that are doing business in China just want to pump those profits that little bit more, only part of the population has extra money to spend and there is a non zero chance one day all your investment in the country goes poof because you angered the government. Plus that government is only becoming more easily angered by the day.\n\nI'm interested to see if they let COD back in the market even though they removed the footage from the trailer, if it's one thing they can't stand being mentioned it's Tiananmen Square. It's literally something that you are not allowed to talk about and does not appear in any state approved Chinese media ever, and as we can see with video games it all has to be approved of by the CCP.",

China is attempting to use cultural influence to increase their standing in the world, in the same way that American cultural influence came to dominate the world over the last hundred years. Video games and movies are their main targets, and they push to have the changes made worldwide rather than just for the local market, so the rest of the world sees what China wants us to see. But you also see it in other things, like how they wanted to bully the NBA over remarks about Hong Kong.",

How do you rake in this much cash glorifying the American ideal of giving your life to defend freedom and not see the dissonance here?

You live under yours, they live under theirs.\n\nThe worldwide censoring of shit is where the issue is. Not WoW changing content for Chinese servers. They're just following Chinese law in China.",

You're all for doing the right thing when it came to the black lives matter movement but you don't want to touch a nerve in the Chinese government. So what if your game doesn't sell in China. You make less money but you'll still make a profit and you'll be respected for taking a real stand. Chinese people will hear about what happened and the truth will prevail. You could be on the right side of history but instead you support an oppresive regime.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver. I see some agree with me and some have taken issue with my comment. At least we can have a civil discussion about it on an internet forum. Consider that if we were censored, as is the case in some places, this would not be allowed.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the awards. I've been enjoying reading the comments and getting everyone's perspective.",

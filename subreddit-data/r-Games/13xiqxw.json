Can change while in a fight.\n* Hittites more heavily armored, Egyptians lighter and therefore better movement in sand etc.",

I already thought Troy's map was too big, and with no naval combat and 50% of it being the sea, it makes it impossible to pin down enemy armies. Plus games dragged on for twice as long as they needed to be because of the constant confederations, so every time you're about to wipe out your targetted enemy they just get brought into a larger enemy and you have to keep going. I still mostly play Rome 2 because the campaign length is more predictable, even though I kind of prefer the more modern gameplay feel of Troy (also city sieges in Troy felt awful, and I hate playing as the Greeks just because they're required to capture Troy itself).",

It felt super anticlimactic going back to Rome 2 and charging a bunch of peasants with Bactrian cataphracts only to do nothing. Charging in 3K felt so much better since you can see the shock from cavalry charges especially from heavy lancer types.",

                            "comment": "Nom, cavalry in the form of horse riders charging into enemy ranks weren't a thing until King Philip of Maxcedon, Alexander's father. He basically invented the entire concept. The era of Alexander the Great and the Bronze Age Collapse are removed from one another by about 1,000 years. So about the time span between William the Conqueror to today.\n\nHorses back in the day were TINY maybe not much bigger (or even smaller) than modern donkeys. They had neither the size nor strength to carry a person + equipment on their backs. So you had them pull chariots containing two people, the driver and the archer. Pulling a chariot is generally easier than carrying something on their back since the chariot also comes with wheels.\n\nOnly as horses were bred to become bigger and stronger was cavalry possible. Later the invention of the stirrup also helped a lot. The Companion cavalry from Alexander's time didn't have stirrups yet which is why they were so special. The recoil of your own weapons would constantly try to throw you down as you pushed your spears into enemies without having stirrups to help you hold onto your horse.\n\nThe saddle was invented even later than that.\n\nSo cavalry becoming a thing and being a standard in warfare was the huge difference between the Classical era and the later Roman era (the 2nd war between Carthage and Rome started like 100 years after Alexander the Great died). And cavalry made such a major difference on the battlefield that it spread like wildfire across the globe becoming a standard very quickly just about everywhere. Even far away in Japan. Because it was cavalry that was the reason Alexander was so successful. The pike phalanx job was just to be the anvil, to keep the enemy busy, while the cavalry would be the hammer.\n\nI'd argue the invention of cavalry was just as big of a deal to the evolution of warfare as the invention of gunpowder was. It changed everything.\n\nBut BECAUSE of that you can't just ignore history either by shoving cavalry into an era where it doesn't belong. It would be like adding guns into a game set in the Roman era.",

It's coming out in 6 months, and this is a promo video, get real. It should not look like the most soulless mobile cash grab imaginable. They say they want it to be comparable to [Rome 2](https://guides.gamepressure.com/totalwarromeii/gfx/word/73616856.jpg) and [3K](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/totalwar/images/e/e4/TW3K_Reforms-reveal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190123071411) in scope and theme?! Give me a break.\n\nI honestly cannot understand how they chose this setting, and then just shat out such an [ugly UI](https://i.imgur.com/snFiiqf.png). I know it seems I'm harping on something minor, but it just taints the whole project for me.\n\nAnd I absolutely loved both the Egyptian setting in AC Origins and the doomsday foreboding in Attila, so you'd think the theme would work for me, but the threads are just too loose here. The history behind this time period is understudied, involves a lot of guesswork, and has practically no imprint on the modern cultural zeitgeist. I mean, bonus points for trying to change that I suppose, but the source material for it is barely there.\n\nI'm willing to be wrong, especially since it's been over 4 years since we got a full historical TW game, but I'm getting strong \"wait for reviews, and then wait for Steam ratings, and then wait some more\" vibes from all this. :(",

But man I\u2019m going to sound weird given the name but constantly being besieged with armies and war every turn isn\u2019t as fun as I\u2019d like. I\u2019m trying to love it because I love the setting and style is amazing. \n\nBy constraint in a 4X game usually you set number of factions or enemies. You might keep it low like I do to expand without interruptions for awhile. When I play Stellaris for example I can make a warmongering faction but wars are not constant. You expand and build up to one. It happens and ends like most wars. In Warhammer I try to expand but then I\u2019m attacked on 3 different fronts at the same time. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly under attack. I try to turtle but then you don\u2019t have resources and I can understand it being more a game about being aggressive. \n\nI think my biggest issue is you can\u2019t expand without conquering really. What I mean is there\u2019s no way to say put less factions on the map to start like a game of civ or Stellaris. Though the latter I will admit is more role playing than strategy in many way. \n\nJust curious why you love total war so much? And If my comments make sense. Or is that just a warhammer thing and other total war games are more like I was thinking?",

I love Stellaris too, and the first 50 years is always my favorite part, for the same reasons you mentioned.\n\nPart of the reason I don't like the Warhammer titles is that I enjoy the economic/diplomatic parts as much as the tactical battles, and the Warhammer titles really constrain what you can do with that. 3K's diplomacy is just soooo much better, and even with all the faction diversity in WH it feels like you just get railroaded into certain alliances no mater what, due to the faction affinities. And there's practically no economy to speak of. Not that TW titles have ever really been about econ, more than just making enough money to build/maintain another army, but it's nice to feel like you're stabilizing things for your faction even if you have to use imagination a bit.\n\nHopefully one day they'll improve the econ aspect as much as 3K did for diplomacy, and then we'll have a true GOTY contender.",

Maybe I should try another of the recent titles then that you mentioned if they come on sale. I really love the thrill and tactics of the battles though.  Thank you!",

You're right that Warhammer is more \"war focused\" compared to most games, but a lot of that is due to some stuff being a bit railroaded - Chaos always pops up after a while, Beastmen might come at you randomly, and there's factional \"rivalries\" that make it more likely for someone to declare war on you: for example, if you're playing as the Vampire Counts, you're almost guaranteed to get hit by the Empire sooner or later, while the Dwarves will usually leave you alone. Since you're a Stellaris nerd too, I'm sure you've consulted the Diplomacy tab, but if not, that gives you a good idea as to who you need to look out for, where to put a decent garrison, etc., and why someone's opinion of you drops or increases.\n\nThe campaign AI in some of the older games (especially Rome II and Empire) can be... unpredictable, to put it gently. You might be at peace and in the money one turn, and engaged in two different wars, with every naval trade route you have getting raided the next. I would say turtling is more viable than in the Warhammer games, but it can still be annoying as hell. Diplomacy and the campaign AI is one of the weakest parts of TW, in my opinion, and every game has its own drawbacks. Some are better than others, but not a one is perfect (although I've heard great things about 3K).",

It seems exactly like 3K except with the addition of siege ladders, which is just a faster siege tower.\n\nThe whole wall sapping is just a wait outside for x turns, which traditionally unless you are sieging a monumental challenge (where the ai will just sally out anyways).\n\nI didn't see siege units (maybe they removed them entirely which would be an okay change) since those completely invalidated the wait tactics.",

            "comment": "I feel like video games are getting way too expensive now. I didn\u2019t really keep up with new games when I was in college, but now that I have more free time, I\u2019m realizing how much more expensive it feels. Some games have even went up to $70. \n\nBut not only are you paying $70 for a game, you need to pay $20 every few months right away to get battle pass content. Then some games are quadrupling up by costing $60, having paid DLC that does not combine old DLC content, has a battle pass, and a cosmetic store.\n\nPlaying a game and constantly being hit with more ways to be monetized is really frustrating. \n\nIt feels like with the base game you get way less. I just want to pay for a game and not worry about it hitting my wallet again immediately.",

Of course they arent completely without fault, but since their early 2010s debacle it feels like thats the worse they had to go through as far as controversies go, especially compared to other big 3rd gaming companies. And to be honest theirs wasnt as bad as most other companies, just kinda scummy practices. Most that were around since the 90s are either gone, merged into other companies, and those that are still sticking around have been to hell and back with some form of controversy. Its kinda crazy to think about. There might be another company that hasnt been as controversial from the 90s til now but I cant think of it.",

It's Outlast's hide and seek gameplay with Deep Rock like objectives, progression systems and co-op gameplay. Normally in Outlast you cannot fight back whatsoever but in this new one you are given tools to level the playing field a bit. Devour is also a horror co-op game in the same vein but lacking long term progression.\n\nAlso, V Rising is loads of fun co-op and resembles Grounded and Valheim a bit in terms of building + gear progression.",

Could you answer these questions?\n\nIs D4 just running around button mashing, to get stronger, to button mash the next large thing? Is there any strategy and nuance? If it is just button mashing what makes it fun and engaging? Are vibes/ambience enough to carry it?\n\nOther modern RPGs I've liked have been Dark Souls/From Soft games (love these) and Nier Automata. Neir was a bit button mashy but still fun, and the story, music, and environment were amazing, and all combined really made me love it. I love all the DS/BB/Sekiro and find getting good addictive, and love the dark env and mystery in those games. Hades was also cool, but more of a rougelike. I found god of war boring boring, but d4 seems nothing like that. As far as bullet-hells, I loved Returnal.\n\nThanks for the people who respond to this!",

                    "comment": "There are usually two quite distinct phases to the gameplay in any game like Diablo. The leveling phase and endgame. We don't know too much about how Diablo 4's endgame will shake out yet for obvious reasons.  \n\nDiablo 4's leveling phase is, at least in my view, more methodical in ability use and avoiding enemy attacks than it was in D2 and D3, especially on the higher difficulty. The very basic builds for each class have the same building blocks: one auto attack that generates resource, one more powerful attack that consumes that resource, three 5-20 second cooldown abilities (can be damage, movement, defensive, support, what have you), and an ultimate ability on a 30-60 second cooldown. During the early gameplay (after the first few levels to unlock skills), you'll definitely juggle your class resource and cooldowns for the bigger fights. Depending on your build, positioning may also be very important to get the most out of your abilities. Mashing can work for some builds, but won't be very effective on the higher difficulty in most cases.  \nSome classes can play quite a lot like Hades (melee Rogue especially) - though taking small hits is a lot less punishing. Larger enemies have some telegraphed powerful attacks that you want to dodge and bosses doubly so. But with two dozen enemies on screen at once, things can get hectic which is why taking a hit or two is almost inevitable and therefore not too punishing with a fairly generous potion system.\n\nBut for most games in the ARPG genre, the leveling gameplay is a lot slower than endgame. Once your build comes together and you can stack your gear to benefit it, your character naturally becomes faster at killing things and will usually also get increases in attack and/or movement speed, further increasing the pace. What the games differ in, however, is the extent of that increase in pace. For example, Path of Exile's endgame gameplay could be described as seizure-inducing with the speed everything explodes at for some builds. But we don't quite know where Diablo 4 will land, probably not on the PoE end of the spectrum, though - at least not until a few years down the line.  \nBut in general, the \"git gud\" aspect is far less pronounced in these games than in a Soulslike. Since the gear grind is the focus of the endgame, that gear is also where most of your progression comes from, not player skill improvements. Sure, you can clear content earlier and more efficiently if you're good, but the skill barrier can also be overcome with better gear instead. And that's where the engagement comes from, too. Improving your character, finding that one rare piece you're still missing. Ultimately, it's \"monkey brain like when number go bigger\". It doesn't work for everyone but if it does, it can make you put a thousand hours in easily.  \nThat said, you likely won't get to a proper endgame build going before 40 or so hours which might be how long the campaign plus majority of side quests take you. At least that'd be my best guess for someone new to the genre.\n\nI quite like the atmosphere and world building in D4, at least from what I've played so far. It's certainly head and shoulders above most other games in its genre, but that's not saying too much.",

No part of me thinks it will be an inherently bad game, and as far as the core goes, I think Blizzard will treat it right. But at the same time, I hope they dont bombard it with microtransaction and in-game shop items like theyve been doing with their rest of their IP.\n\nFor the past couple of weeks in between the hype of fans, Ive heard nothing but negative stuff regarding shop items, passes, cosmetics, faked Q&amp;As, this and that, etc. While some of it is true that Ive seen, a lot of it can also be sensationalized for the sake of clicks, this goes for streamers and \"influencers\" too.\n\nI just hope for the sake of the people that truly love the IP and had to way for nearly a decade for this, as someone who loves being part of a fandom and embracing titles, that everything works out well for these guys.",

Yes, the prices are ridiculous, but none of it affects gameplay. That makes \"vote with your wallet\" an absolutely reasonable choice.  \nThe battle pass has some niche way to slightly accelerate progress once the season starts. But... so what? There are no leaderboards to compete on and for PvP, that tiny head start won't matter past the first two days.\n\nBefore I get called a shill, [my most upvoted post is calling out Blizzard for their treatment of WC3 Reforged](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/k22z91/even_10_months_after_release_warcraft_iii/) and there's plenty more the company does which you can rightfully be angry about. But all the Diablo 4 controversies seem manufactured to me because hating on Blizzard currently gives clicks.  \nThe game plays well, does nothing more egregious than is currently industry standard, and the launch was smoother than anyone expected.",

The cartoony feeling, story didn't help and neither did the expansion.\n\nI realized that maybe the old hack and slash a pack of mobs mindlessly didn't appeal to me anymore. I felt that I was playing for nothing, without a goal in sight.\n\nPicked up Diablo 4 yesterday, didn't played the beta but it hooked me on the atmosphere, trailer, story and tone. However the gameplay videos seemed almost too familiar to something. Never the less I gave it a try. And after the first 20-30 minutes of how the story unfolded was brilliant. Until, again I started to play for 5 consecutive hours of the same two button game play with none of that story hooks in sight. The skills felt bland, the game play boring, overflown map with check marks. And it played like D3 a bit slower.\n\nTL;DR: Concluded that this is just a reskin of D3 with a darker tone and refunded.\nIf you liked D3 and hack&amp;slash RPGs in general, you might like this one.",

Even if they don't get burnt out and are still happy to play it in 6 months or a year when I decide to buy it, it's a very different experience with them having already played it so much and everything being completely new to me.",

If we *really* want to play something together but one of us doesn't want to buy it, like in this case, sometimes we pitch in to get it for them so they don't have to spend on something that they don't really want to for the sake of being included.\n\nI wouldn't really like the idea of my friends feeling pressured to make questionable purchases just to not feel left out, but this is definitely something that developed with time and when I was younger I bought a lot of things for exactly the reasons that you state.\n\nI guess I just have far too long of a list of games that I regret spending money on at this point in life, and it makes it easier to be wary.",

I'll probably just wait for a while just to see what kind of fuckery blizzard decide to pull off.\n\n&gt;I wouldn't really like the idea of my friends feeling pressured to make questionable purchases just to not feel left out, but this is definitely something that developed with time and when I was younger I bought a lot of things for exactly the reasons that you state.\n\nYeah that's fair and I normally wouldn't consider it but I am excited for the game and if blizzard hadn't spent last 15 years being blizzard I'd buy it in a heartbeat but they've really completely ruined any sort of faith I had in them. Still kinda sucks to miss out since we don't play that many games together often anymore now that we're a bit older and have more obligations and commitments.",

Lost Ark is also somewhat similar but afaik it's very grindy and pay2win. Path of Exile is also really popular but I personally never enjoyed it as much as previously mentioned games.",

There is likely some bias here due to the steam deck however\n\n- Nvidia and Intel have maintained their majority within 1% for the past 2 years for whatever reason. No real shift either way\n\n- Oculus Quest 2 is the most popular headset by far, but Valve Index is still 2nd place\n\nJust interesting to see how the real world ends up",

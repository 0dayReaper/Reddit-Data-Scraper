The terminology alone (which is generally used without explanation) for even simple processes is well beyond what a typical computer user would be familiar with, including those with many years of experience in Windows.\n\nThey throw out words like \"mount\", \"package\", \"dependency\", and more as if those are universally understood concepts.\n\nNow, I absolutely agree that these distributions (I use Manjaro myself) are perfectly functional out of the box and are user friendly enough to get by. But if you start trying to tinker -- because you want to get the experience closer to what you are used to on Windows, or get around some particular annoyance -- buckle up.\n\nMy favorite issue is if you dual boot with Windows and have your music library on your Windows hard drive, good luck trying to figure out how to make those music files available in your Linux music player's library. It's possible, of course (in Linux, anything is possible), but now you find yourself reading lengthy guides trying to figure out how to make sure that entire hard drive will actually be mounted automatically when you start the computer, because it sure won't do it by default and there is no setting you can simply toggle on and off (at least on this distribution).",

Way back then, whenever I had problems with Mandrake or RedHat 5 I could go to the forums, ask a stupid question and get some amazing answers almost instantly and not only that, they would also explain to me exactly what it all meant. \n\nThere were tutorials for everything, written like useful college books with screenshots and examples. You want to do something on 3D Studio Max? Photoshop? Visual Basic? Unreal Engine 2? Dude, the resources were wide and fruitful. People went out of their way to make sure you understand the problem and you could come up solutions by yourself next time. \n\nNow? Eh. You get a youtube guy stammering for 50 minutes on a thing you could do in 3, people telling you to go fuck yourself straight on if you ask an \"Amateur\" question, shit, son. The Unity community, for example, I can't ask jack shit over there I'm gonna get swallowed whole. I had some good experiences with some of the plugins author, though, but if you ask a general question on how to make a character move in a grid, for example, either you get \"lol, n00b\" or some contrived explanation \"You have to learn this yourself or else you will never learn blablabla it's so easy I can't believe you would ask that\" and that is if they even bother answering you. \n\nBefore you had like 90% helpful people 10% trolls, now it's the contrary.",

I have all tiles gone at home, but as a systems administrator, I really can't take the time to go through every newly configured system for users and disable the advertising that still appears even after you tell Windows no in the initial configuration. And even when you do this, MS is still collecting and selling your user data at the OS level which was not okay with me. I feel there is a philosophical difference between say Facebook doing this and Windows. One is an opt-in platform while the other is the basis for being able to use a computer.\n\nYeah and the community recriprocates it. It's very obnoxious. I saw a thread the other day where someone was trying to figure out how to uninstall i3wm, and the top comment was 'if you don't know how to do that, you're in over your head,'. I have never wanted to smack someone so hard through a screen. Like this guy knows he's above his paygrade but he's trying to learn you egotistical shitstick *thats why he's asking* It's excatly this kind of gatekeeping snobbery that prevents Linux from gaining any meaningful adoption in the mainstream.\n\nOn another note, I moved over at work from Windows to Ubuntu some time ago and I have to say I can't see myself going back. Ubuntu has done an especially good job of helping to integrate drivers into their ecosystem. My thunderbolt dell dock worked plug and play from install and everything has been great. I also got some games patched in with Lutris and had better performance than with Windows and the same (no gpu) specs. If you haven't tried it or it has been a long time, I would seriously look into dual booting your system. Its a fun project that takes less than an hour, teaches you a lot, and gives you Linux experience which is a great thing to put on a resume.\n\nFor me persoanlly, I got fed up with Windows after seeing the umpteenth ad for minecraft in my start menu while realizing they had hidden the ability to make local accounts behind several 'dark patterns' I downloaded the Ubnutu iso and wiped my drive. It has really been a godsend for everything work related, but until game support is better (and Adobe) my gaming Pc has to stay windows :/\n\nThere are pretty good answers to most questions you might run into when trying to set everything up, and if you're doing any sort of administration you will probably still rely on Windows VMs, but for the average user, I would argue that Ubuntu is actually easier to use than Windows these days. \n\nThere should not be ads in your operating system. And the fact that we're at the point where people are willing to accept this sort of behavior from companies is very concerning.",

It may be extreme and narrow-minded since it is inconsiderate of those who do use those companies, but at least they can say \"I thought I was doing you a favor by warning you.\"\n\nBut jeez, that first comment chain ... wow, that's some nasty egotism.\n\n&gt;  I can say, from personal experience, that Linux users, for the most part, are superior to Windows users.\n\nI know he means in terms of technical understanding, but that's still completely misguided. A lot of people (myself included [Arch btw]) use Linux because we have a mix of time, knowledge, and dissatisfaction that we don't mind mucking around with an operating with shoddy support. It's not about being so much more elite or \"superior\" it's that we are dissatisfied with Windows and feel compelled to spend the time in something else.\n\nBesides, dude probably works in IT with other people who spend time on Linux machines. Those are \"smart\" people who use Linux for work or school and had an easier time dipping their feet into it. I know plenty of technologically adept people who just use Windows because they can use it for all their \"Windows stuff,\" and use a VM or ssh to do \"Linux stuff.\" \n\nGetting all my lib32 libraries installed to play Steam games on Linux was a pain. Then I only get a small fraction of my library. I don't even bother with wine anymore, too much hassle. I still use Windows to play games and run some Adobe software. It's okay to use both, it's okay to not think Linux is great, and it's wrong to think just by the software you use that you are somehow better than everyone else.\n\n&gt; However, a lot of Linux users tend to be arrogant and insufferable too.\n\nYeah, with that attitude. But he could also just, you know, not be an ass and the problem would go away. He could enjoy his \"superior\" system and live and let live.\n\n&gt; Linux users provide their own Technical support.\n\nAgain, completely off base here. First, this is absolutely because of necessity. I'm sure if there was tech support for Linux software, the phone line would be ringing off the hook (because it would use \"superior\" landline phones). As it stands, \"tech support\" is a series of forum and StackExchange posts telling users to read the man page and use the search option (to find more pages of people saying to use the search option). Nobody provides their own tech support because nobody is born with the immediate knowledge of how the software works. We are forced to ask each other, and unfortunately have to deal with dicks who say \"either figure it out yourself or go to Windows.\" It's not a healthy ecosystem, even though I'm sure elitists are in heaven.\n\nIt's all cyclical: be a dick, scare away new users, keep the ecosystem small, be ignored for official support, have people ask the community for support, repeat.\n\n&gt; So, don't whine to me because your feelings are insulted. I speak the truth.\n\nSaying stuff with your best \"I'd like to speak to your manager\" writing doesn't mean it's true. Again, as an Arch user [vim btw], I'm insulted he thinks this is how all Linux users think, or that it's \"the way\" it is in Linux.\n\n&gt; Linux users are better than Windows users - deal with it!\n\nI can't believe this got upvotes. I guess that's why I don't and never have subbed to /r/linux. It's just gross.",

For example, if you download a .deb file on Ubuntu, the most widely recommended Linux distro for new users, double-clicking it will start the installation process inside Ubunutu Software Center.\n\nThe majority of useful software downloads are not usually from the Internet, though, they will come from an official repository maintained for your specific distro. This is different than the Windows paradigm, where your main source of software is a hundred different sites on the internet. That's probably the main thing to grasp about software management in Linux, instead of downloading installers as a first step, you usually want to go to the official repositories first.",

It'll have a lot of apps already ready for use. It's basically the Linux equivalent of an app store, except most things are free and relatively high quality.  \n\nIf you need to download an app from a website, it'll most likely come in three possible formats: .deb, .rpm or .tar.gz \n\n.deb needs the Debian package manager - Linux Mint and Ubuntu are the two biggest Debian forks out there right now. Just double-click it and the package manager will do the rest. If you're using Fedora/CentOS, you most likely downloaded the wrong package, because... \n\n.rpm needs the RPM Package Manager, most often found on the two aforementioned systems. Again, double-click and the package manager will do the rest. \n\n.tar.gz is a simple archive - ~~unlike Windows~~ just like Windows, not all software needs to be installed. For a .tar.gz, simply extract it somewhere you've got read/write permission (like your home folder) and execute the program inside. If it doesn't run, you may be missing dependencies, and most distros will tell you as much - I think some distros even give you a handy little button to install those dependencies. After that, it should run just fine.  \n\nSomething to note, most Linux distros don't make desktop shortcuts, by default - instear relying on the \"start menu\" (whatever they call it) to list the applications. If you want a desktop shortcut, you'll need to make one yourself. ",

None whatsoever, there are only downsides, from driver issues to worse performance, not to mention a much smaller library of games, even if we include fiddling with software like Wine that allows you to play non-Linux games on Linux.\n\nOutside of gaming, there are certain advantages. Linux is and always will be open source, most distributions are free, as is most of the software for it, which can usually be easily and quickly downloaded, installed and kept updated using repositories (basically open source app stores). Because it's open source, there's a high level of trust, there are no privacy issues like invasive telemetry or ads. Linux development is transparent and open. \n\nThe shell (command line) is amazing and extremely powerful, feels less archaic than the Windows equivalent. Linux distributions come in all sorts of flavors (and you can make one yourself if you are so inclined), can be anything from large, pretty and user friendly to incredibly small and efficient; there are some modern distros that are less than 20MB in size *with a GUI* and even smaller without. Linux also runs on anything, from the ancient 486 you found in the attic to standard PCs, small microcomputers like the Raspberry Pi, car infotainment systems, appliances, small servers, supercomputers and everything in between. It's most likely running on your phone right now in the form of Android.\n\nPersonally, I'm fine with using Windows as my main OS and Linux in a virtual machine, if necessary. It's the best of both worlds.",

Sadly as a C4D and Adobe user, trying to get their programs running on Linux is essentially a huge waste of time considering I can just boot into Windows and everything just works basically.",

Virtually all Laptops/Desktops come with Windows pre-installed. Security is not an issue unless you deliberately download an infected file. The upside is that it's much more likely that somebody you know can help you with your Computer if it runs Windows. Be it installing a program, troubleshooting a problem or anything else.\n\nBut even if you just use the machine to open a browser, since Windows already comes installed and thus the price is baked into the hardware, there's no real incentive to use Linux.",

To be honest, it's less a push for Linux and more of a push against Windows, it just so happens that Linux is the most reasonable competitor right now (because you're not supposed to be install OSX on a non Apple product)",

            "comment": "I know this won't be seen because this topic is too old and the hate train on Linux has the several thousand upvotes.  But in reading most of those top posts I am shaking my head.  So much misinformation about Linux in it.  I could spend a lot of time responding to each and answering how they are wrong, with citations, but each of those would be equally ignored.  So, I am going to take just one example to show how the basis of what people are saying is wrong so that at least some people might see it.\n\nThe common refrain in most of the top posts boils down to, \"Windows is easier\", coupled with \"Why can't I just double-click to install something like on Windows\", and the ever popular \"I shouldn't have to go to the command-line.\"\n\nHere is what I am putting forth.  Linux, in today's day and age, is *not harder*.  It is *different* than what you're used to and *unfamiliar*.  Windows is familiar, not easier.  Since we're in /r/games I will explain using an analogy to something I hope most of us in the PC world are familiar with.  Steam.\n\nPeople ask, \"Why can't I just double click something to install?\"  Well, for the most part, on every modern distribution that a person only familiar with Windows should be cutting their teeth on (Ubuntu its siblings and children), you can.   Pretty much every piece of software native to Linux that you will want to install is installed not by going to a web site, downloading an installer, running it and then getting the software installed.  It is installed through a package manager.\n\nWhat's a package manager?\n\nSteam.\n\nSure, it's an online store, a file distribution system, a slew of other things.  But at its core Steam is a package manager.  It is a utility which allows you to install *and manage* games from a single place.  You don't bring out the pitchfork and torches, proclaiming that it's easier to install games by going to each manufacturer's website, downloading their installer, and running it.  In fact, large swaths of people who post to /r/games lament when developers decide to make their own storefront because now instead of having one location to install and update their games, they have 2.  Or 3.  Or more.\n\nWhy do I say this is different and that Windows isn't better?  Well, think of all the other pieces of software outside of Steam games which you have installed on your Windows box.  All of those icons in your system tray for small installers all doing the same thing.  They exist to periodically check to see if there is an update and, if there is one, nag you about it.  If you're like me on my work machine I get nagged several times a week to do a one-off update to software on my machine.\n\nHow often does Steam nag you to update your games individually?  It doesn't.  It queues them all up and you can either have them update automatically, or manually kick off that update at your convenience.\n\nNow, imagine that convenience and control that Steam gives over keeping your games up-to-date.  Not just your games but your games' mods if they are on the Steam Workshop.  Not just your base OS, which is all Windows updates normally touched, but all your applications.  And your drivers.  And your supporting libraries.  Everything on your system updated in a timely manner without the constant, one-off, nagging and pestering of each individual program running its own launcher.\n\nPeople ask, \"Why can't I just run an installer?\"  I counter, \"Why ***MUST*** I run an installer?  Why ***MUST*** I go through the constant interruptions to my workday?\"  Or, even worse, why must I have Windows itself forcefully remove me from my game time to tell me I must update now **OR ELSE** it is going to nag me in an hour by doing the exact same thing?\n\nI don't see the Windows way as easier!  Far from it.  It is laborious, it is intrusive, it is inefficient, it is aggravating.  Most of all, it is a problem that has been solved by Steam for games right about a decade ago, and Linux is but one example of how it has been solved for everything else.\n\nWhich brings me to the \"I shouldn't have to go to the command-line.\"  You may feel that way, but trust me, Windows is not immune to it as well.  Just the other day my coworker's networking died.  A reboot didn't help.  What fixed it?\n\nStart, type CMD, type in the following commands:\n\n    ipconfig /release\n    ipconfig /flushdns\n    ipconfig /renew\n\nI'm sure there might be a GUI way to do it (though I have never found it) but think of how easy that is to convey to a coworker while he has a customer on the line and needs his networking back up and running so he can get back to work.\n\nThe reason why so many instructions for Linux default to the command line isn't because you **have** to use it, but because it is **easier to concisely explain the steps in a simple to copy-and-paste format**.\n\nEach Linux website offering advice on how to do something knows that they cannot presume your distribution.  Are you running Ubuntu?  OK, GNome?  KDE?  XFCE?  Mint?  Cinnamon?  What is the one set of directions that works on all of them?\n\n\"Open a command window and run these commands.\"\n\nGetting back to the Steam analogy imagine someone wanted to install a Game which was available on GoG, Steam, the developer's web site and though it'll never happen, Origin, Blizzard's storefront and Epic as well.  If you were going to tell them a way to, say, add a mod to their game how would you begin to be able to tell them where to go in each launcher to find the \"Browse the game's directory?\"  You don't.  You write it with launcher agnostic language and examples.\n\nSay you want to install Steam on your freshly installed Ubuntu machine.  I, not knowing what flavor you have, could spend quite a few minutes trying to tell you, \"OK, so, do you know where your package manager is?  Uhm, no.  Look under the menu for system and something that might say Software and Updates.  No?  Uhm.\"\n\nOr, I could say, \"Open the command line, run this command: sudo apt install steam\"\n\nEven better, if I were typing it in IM you could copy/paste that command and you have successfully installed steam.  But say a few days on you know where your package manager is do you *have* to open the command line to install something?  No.  You see \"sudo apt install steam\" and go \"Oh, open package manager, search for Steam, select it, install.\"\n\nThe processes that the Linux world has built up (and by no means am I ignoring other OSes or Distributions, just confining it for this discussion) is not harder.  I find it easier.  Much easier.  The focus is more on long term stability and convenience rather than short-term convenience but long-term frustration.  Let me tie it all together with one final canard I've seen floating around; graphics drivers.\n\nFirst off, it has been over a decade since I've *had* to install a graphics driver to get the desktop to work on Linux.  This is self-evident as most distributions these days run from a USB stick built from an ISO so you can try it out before installing it from the same.  Fun fact, when I installed my gaming rig's current Ubuntu I played Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup on Akrasiac server in Firefox which was running on the 2nd monitor from the 18.10 install ISO on USB to pass the time until it finished.\n\nBut, yes, to get some *Windows* games running on nVidia right now you need to install the Beta branch of those drivers.  This is akin to having to install the baseline nVidia drivers *at all* to get the full power of your card on Windows.  So having to do it is not a point against Linux.\n\nWhat people want to do is the familiar.  To go nVidia's web site, go through its process of trying to guide you to the right card, download the installer, run the installer, have it then download the drivers, install the drivers.  Then from that point on have a stub of an installer check for driver updates and, if found, nag you to run it again to get the latest drivers.\n\nHere's the different approach.  Locate the nVidia PPA (Personal Package Archive) and add it to your system.  Update your packages.  Run your package manager.  Locate the updated nVidia drivers.  Mark for install.  Install.  Then from that point on, ***any time you update your system your drivers will be updated as well.***\n\nMind you the baseline nVidia drivers would also be updated, just at a slower pace.  Which is why PPAs were created.  Any why companies should provide PPAs for their drivers.\n\nDifferent, not harder.  Trust me, if you were in the habit of using PPAs and package managers you would look at the hew and cry for individual installers as madness.  Much like someone who would come into /r/games now and say, \"Man, Steam is so hard to use.  Why can't I just buy from the publisher's website, download it and double click to install?\"",

I like base building games, it's sold a ton of copies (I think it hit another million milestone in the past 24 hours), and I've seen streams where people are having a lot of fun with it. Plus, it's pretty cheap.\n\nBut my gaming budget is very tight right now, and something about it feels like it's more fun to watch than to play for me. And I can't put my finger on what. To know for certain, I will have to buy it. But if I buy it, even if I don't end up fancying it, I won't want to return it (even if I can). I just don't really know what it is about that game that puts me off actually playing it.",

Whereas FFXIV is more focused on story/setting, WoW's big weakness, than trying to compete on content.",

WoW lured us all in with a truly massive world with tons to discover and explore as we levelled to 60 for the first time...and THEN we got a heap of great endgame content. FFXIV:ARR had a lengthy but fully developed story to get you to the endgame. Fortnight has a great rewards loop to feed the fun and unique gameplay.\n\nSo many other games don't bring something to the table up front, whether it be great gameplay, an engaging world, or a quality story, that they end up losing players' interest before their real qualities have a chance to shine.\n\nAs an example, I dug Destiny 1 when it came out for the neat gameplay and unique setting, but after I found that the content was set to be revisiting the same half a dozen worlds for the same half a dozen fetch/kill quests, I lost interest. The gear progression wasn't engaging to me. The story relied on finding cards and then going online to read them and painstakingly piece the lore together. The hub world was poorly laid out and alluded to a greater universe and adventure that just wasn't there. By the time the expansions came out and started delivering on all those promises, I had already moved on. And I know I wasn't alone in that experience. \n\nFor a service game to be a hit like Fortnite or WoW, it has to nail multiple aspects from the get-go, and that's reeeeaaallly tough to pull off, even with EA money behind you.",

It's unfortunate that there isn't anything else like it.\n\nEDIT: Oh, it appears in the latest State of Destiny, they're getting rid of sunsetting. This is great! :)",

The best open world games have a lot of movement options to get around the map without having to simply resort to fast traveling, as you would expect. They put a lot of time into the map and they\u2019d want you to want to explore it.\n\nBut then you get a game like Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, which is fucking massive and you feel like you barely move at a reasonable speed through it. The boats are usually slow as heck and even horses don\u2019t feel that quick. Compare their horses to RDR1, and it\u2019s like night and day.",

Thematically, the open world made a lot of sense, and the world was crafted incredibly well with a lot of variability in its locations. Exploring the world was fun because the world, at least to me, was interesting, even if the extrinsic rewards aren't there.

You can have \"wide linear\" or some other term and have big zones to run through for each part of the game. This allows the developers to craft more tailored zones to your current power level or hide more goodies like lore bits and thing, because you'll find them in an intended order.",

Horizon Zero Dawn was basically a game about the world.  It's one of those stories where the setting is arguably more important to the story than any actual characters.  And it's easier to make it feel like a world in an open game.\n\nGranted, you can pull it off without a completely open game.  A structure that's more of a sequence of hub areas like Borderlands can still convey a lot of atmosphere and give a lot of personality to the world.\n\nBut I agree that it's not like the open world contributed nothing to the game.  It didn't add a ton to the gameplay, but the feeling of it being a world, of the machines feeling like wild animals and not scripted encounters, was pretty essential to the game.",

But it was cool to watch the \"animals\" interact on their own, and maybe sneak up and interact with the wild like an actual hunter.\n\nGhost of Tsushima was good about this too. \n\nGames like Assassin's Creed and Elder Scrolls felt like a big chore list.

That's why they're master pieces. For most open world games, sure, that place looks cool, look at all these characters, but you quickly realise a lot of the interaction with the world or NPCs or story progression really isn't as open as it pretends to be, so I don't have the incentive to sink another dozen hours exploring when I can't really do my own thing anyway. That's my thoughts.",

How many games have tried it and we're basically left with Fortnite, Warzone, Apex and PUBG in addition to more feelings of \"enough with the Battle Royale games already\"?",

That's the rules of the pool they play in. EA/Respawn's own Apex is a decent enough example, it's built off the foundation of Titanfall and was a relatively constrained project, and didn't take up the a huge amount of the Respawn studio for 5 years.",

That's their skills, their experience. Asking them to do a Destiny light in the form of a Game as a Service is like trying to fit the square into the round hole. They're not the right studio to do this kind of things. It's not impossible mind you, but it's highly risky.\n\nIf EA wants to try dabbling into GaaS, that's not a bad decision at all, but they need to give that task to the proper studio. Case in point is the one you mention, Respawn. They are a studio with strong roots in multiplayer FPS, so what does EA ask them to do? A multiplayer FPS. That's a recipe for success. Bioware being asked to do Anthem was a recipe for disaster.\n\nIt's a good thing they apparently learn their lesson.",

As soon as I watched that trailer I was concerned, because it really felt like a trailler from a gaas kind of game.\n\nThat was a CGI teaser, so was probably finished months before the Game Awards, when the game was still designed as a gaas.",

I've been following the articles Jason wrote about DA and Bioware for a while, the game went from a single player rpg that devs were super excited about to yet another GaaS described as \"Anthem with dragons\", and now we are going back to a single player focused RPG\n\nI've always been excited about DA and the fact that Bioware was allowed to go back to its roots is great, my only concern is that so many changes in such a short period of time aren't always a good sign.\n\nEdit: grammar",

The game is releasing on July 20th on PC ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2080970/Duckys_Delivery_Service/) / [itch.io](https://ctmatthews.itch.io/duckys-delivery-service)) and a demo is available now on both of those sites. It was briefly shown in yesterday's [Wholesome Direct](https://youtu.be/hHPF2g1HyLs?t=3306) showcase, so you might have seen it there!\n\n**Description:**\n\nPropeller-powered duck delivery action! In Ducky's Delivery Service, you are a duck who uses a propeller backpack to fly around and deliver mail. Master the flight physics, grow your delivery business, fulfill special delivery requests from other ducks, and earn time attack ranks and high scores.\r\n\nMaster the controls of your propeller backpack and discover the fastest routes between destinations in your quest to become the best delivery business around.\r\n\nGrow your delivery business from its humble beginnings and explore increasingly dangerous areas, while avoiding hazards such as windmills, seagulls, falling stalactites and wandering ghosts.\r\n\nHelp other ducks by fulfilling their special delivery requests. Deliver their one-off items to their destinations, while making sure they don't get damaged.\r\n\nEarn time attack ranks by discovering the fastest routes for delivering flyers, and earn high scores by quickly delivering packages without damaging them. Throw packages into mailboxes from a distance for even higher scores!",

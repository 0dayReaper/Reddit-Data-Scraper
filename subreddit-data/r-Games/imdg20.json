He fights Geralt in melee with his staff just to show off. Had he been fighting seriously, he would have just killed him with one of his spells. Geralt only manages to win because Vilgefortz doesn't take him seriously, Vilgefortz hadn't fully regained used of his injured eye, and is caught off guard by Fringilla's amulet - which he did not know about. \n\nVilgefortz doesn't just beat Geralt. He wins a 1v3 against Geralt, Yennefer, and Regis, while crippled, and only dies afterwards by a stroke of utter luck on Geralt's behalf because he happened to have a magical amulet crafted by one of the other strongest mages in the world. It takes the intervention of FOUR powerful characters to result in his death.\n\nI'm 100% sure that Vilgefortz vs Dettlaff would also end in Vilgefortz's favor. That mage is outlandishly deadly in combat and no one other than reality shifters (O'dimm, etc) are likely to stand a chance against him. With prep he might even have been able to take out the Unseen Elder. We never got to see the full extent of Vilgefortz power, but it is safe to say that he is the deadliest humanoid seen in the Witcher universe up until now.\n\nSome important quotations:\n\n\"Vilgefortz stretched out his arms and suddenly spread them. Yennefer cried out in pain and soared up into the air, levitating. Vilgefortz twisted his hands, exactly as though he were wringing out a wet rag. The sorceress howled piercingly.\"\n\n\"The sorcerer had a weapon for every occasion. And every opponent. Even a vampire. The hands that seized Regis glowed like iron. The vampire screamed. Geralt also screamed. seeing the sorcerer literally tearing the Regis apart.\"\n\n\"Geralt swore, putting all his rage and despair into the curse. He leaped at Vilgefortz, raising his sihil to strike. But failed. Vilgefortz turned around and struck him with magical energy. The witcher flew the whole length of the hall and slammed into the wall. He lay like a fish gulping for air, not wondering what was broken, but what was intact. Vilgefortz walked towards him. A six foot iron bar materialized in his hand.\n\n'I could have reduced you to cinders with a spell,' he said. 'I could have melted you into a clinker like I did to that monster a moment ago. But you, Witcher, ought to die differently. In a fight. Not a very honest one perhaps, but still.'\n \n'On Thanedd-' Vilgefortz came closer, whirled the bar like a moulinet '-I only broken you a little bit, sparingly, for it was meant to be a lesson. Since it wasn't learned, this time I'll break you thoroughly, into tiny little bones. So that no one will be able stick you together again.'\"",

Thankfully, this is easily fixed by the incredible HD reworked project mod - seriously one of the most brilliant texture mods I've seen for any game, it respects the original style while boosting asset quality all across the board.\n\nIt even goes a long way improving the lack of \"depth\" in some materials like stone walls - the game famously has no tessalation or any bump mapping. \n\nI hope that the ehanced version will either continue to support this mod or have its own set of texture/material enhancements.",

I did a Deathmarch playthrough for my big one, and I started another to clean up some achievements (I usually try to get all of them). I swear, the entire Velen section is so extremely slow-paced that it almost hurts. Novigrad is better, but it also starts as a slow boil and takes a bit to get going. Skellige is my favorite part/area, but by the time you get there you could easily be tired of the same relatively easy combat system of button mashing, which makes your desire to explore lessened because you know you'll be fighting basically everywhere you go. The expansions were the best parts of the game, but you have to grind out the main story to get to the proper level for the DLC unless you start it by itself and that just feels a bit cheap to me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, playing through for the first time was great, the characters are interesting and the main story is passable, but I just really don't understand how people find so much replayability in it. It feels like the only replay value is to pick which sex scenes you want and that just doesn't feel right for what I hope are obvious reasons.",

It had been about 5 years since I'd played it, so really just living for those cool character moments and scenes.  \n\n\nI'm also taking breaks to play other games between expansions, once I finish Hearts of Stone I'll leave it for a few months, otherwise get a bit of fatigue with the combat and setting, and won't enjoy Blood and Wine as much. If I can wait for the new version then, even better.",

They just announced that Cyberpunk is getting reflections, diffuse illumination, shadows, and ambient occlusion thanks to RT. That should give a big bump to all scenes including the wilderness with little to no reflections.",

It's harder to justify a re-release when you can put your Xbox One disc in a Series X and play it. Theres no reason next gen versions should be anything more than a patch like we've seen on One X and PS4 Pro this gen. \n\nWe don't know how Sont are handling backcompat, but Microsoft's model pretty much kills the next gen remaster culture we saw this gen.",

            "comment": "The only reason why I was a bit surprised by the delay is that CD Projekt Red said they will release it once it was ready. For months (even years perhaps) they kept telling People that. So it sounded like a sure thing on the date.\n\nI wonder at what stage in the development process Developers say, \"Hey! It's time to announce the date\"?",

Just work on something either in secret or announced for years without a date, then announce a date once the game is 99% complete or 100% and give time for marketing.",

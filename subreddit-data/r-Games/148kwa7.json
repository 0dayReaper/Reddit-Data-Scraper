                    "comment": "It makes me so happy that this game is set in the same world as Pillars. The world that Obsidian made for the PoE games is a *really* interesting one, but because both games ended up being pretty niche, it's a world that not a lot of people got to experience. Avowed being a more approachable game set in the same world means that a lot more people will be exposed to it. Meanwhile, as an existing fan of Pillars, I welcome the opportunity to view that world through a more intimate perspective (plus the Living Lands were one of the parts of the world I wanted to see most, so I'm excited for that).",

I was much more interested in the huge open world they originally announced rather than a game the same size and length of The Outer Worlds. Also a bit worrying that they keep just showing combat gameplay, at least for its small size TOW had some variation in approaches and ways to deal with quests. We're not really being shown any of that with Avowed, it's just \" do you want to kill them with a sword or with magic\"",

I\u2019d be pretty disappointed if this ended up scaling that back.",

                            "comment": "&gt; size/scope comparison is referring to the geographical size of the world\n\nThis is closer to what Carrie Patel is referring to. Particularly she described it as a \"series of interconnected open zones\" like The Outer Worlds or KOTOR2 as opposed to one massive open world like Bethesda does.\n\nOf course, this doesn't necessarily mean that Avowed's zones have to be similar in size to The Outer Worlds, it's more of a statement on how the game world is structured.\n\nEDIT: Here's the quote exactly \n\n&gt;\"[Avowed] is going to be roughly comparable to something like **Knights of the Old Republic 2** or **The Outer Worlds**. It's set up as **a series of interconnected open zones** that players can explore at their own pace. You can invest in discovering every nook and cranny in the world, discovering every secret, finding every sidequest, meeting every character, or you can have a much more focused experience. It's really up to players and how much time they want to spend in the Living Lands, but I'm hopeful they're going to spend a lot of time with us once Avowed releases.\"",

I can imagine some companions having archetypes of certain classes, but we don't know how their progression will work at all. They might just use the full player's system, or just have access to a subset of it, or each have their entirely own ability tree.\n\nSource for no classes: https://www.pcgamer.com/avowed-rpg-obsidian-preview-magic-interview/",

I guess I just like classes which have different power sources as part of their identity, like Chanters vs Ciphers vs Paladins. If you just get random abilities willy nilly then there won't be that power source identity the way there is in the first two games.\n\nI guess if they just pick a smaller subset of classes to build support for rather than all 11 classes from Pillars I would be ok with that.",

It was more the lack of mechanical depth and variety of gameplay that gave me a slightly negative initial impression. I've come around on TOW since than and definitely think it and games like it have a place this gen.",

I don't think scaling up to make a huge game is in their best interest. See what happened to Bioware over time? Being a quirky midsize studio that can do whatever they want with a nice limit on resources I think will work out far better in the long run. Not every game has to be huge, anyhow.\n\nEDIT: also totally forgot they're doing Outer Worlds 2 as well, so they've got a lot on their hands already. Would rather have a bunch of interesting smaller games than one or two huge ones.",

It can't possibly hope to match the scale of that game, and I didn't care for any of the factions or companions (with the exception of Vicar Max, Ellie, and Parvati) to want to see more adventures with them either.\n\nI honestly wish they'd work on a new Fallout instead of TOW2, at least then we wouldn't be stuck with Fallout 76 content for at least 15 years before Bethesda gets around to making Fallout 5. One less space RPG wouldn't hurt since there appears to be a drought of post-apocalyptic RPGs for the foreseeable future.",

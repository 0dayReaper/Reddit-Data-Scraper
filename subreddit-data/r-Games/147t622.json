Like they showed a single instance of parrying someone and killing them with an execution type thing, but we have no idea what a typical combat scenario will look like.  I dont see why they wouldnt show this off unless it was because it would clash with how they are trying to market this game.  Bringing back scaffolding to toss people into is neat, and the roofs definitely seem more dense with parkouring routes, but everything about the second to second gameplay seemed identical to the past three games.  I enjoyed 2 out of the last 3 so I'm not against that, but the idea that its \"back to the roots\" seems like marketing more than a reflection of the game.",

It still snapped you to the wrong places but felt great. As it progresses they streamlined it so you could do less and less - albeit the animations looked superb. By the new trilogy you barely climb - you just \"jump climb\" on anything that looks remotely climbable.\n\nI'd love it to return to the more manual style where you can really master the climbing.

There was a very clear and intentional design to the way you climbed in early ACs, limiting you to where you could climb, which made movement much more deliberate. The middle games had a sweet spot where there was more fluidity of animation and more natural handholds but you were less limited where you could climb. It literally tracks with the movement of the games from being about rooftop-jumping assassins to god-like one-man warriors.\n\nIf anything about the later games caused it, it wasn\u2019t technical limitations, it was the increase of scale of the game. As the games have gotten bigger, the focus has been much less on the design of traversal paths through cities as 1) that would take more time and 2) you spend less time in each place. Honestly, I think what you\u2019re calling a technical advancement is really a shortcut to not have to think out traversal paths up buildings or terrain. Sure, it required some tech to have more smooth animations while doing it. However, Unity had much smoother traversal AND more intentional design of traversal paths. I know Unity got trashed for the bugginess but, please, go look at that game and try to tell me with a straight face that the climbing in the RPG games is more technically impressive.",

It was the simplicity. The things that stand out are things like a button to catch a ledge as you're falling, or certain animations, and actually just the snapping mechanic.\n\nAs games went on we lost the ability to grab ledges. Lots of animations disappeared or were made impossible to replicate. And the snapping actually created the tension you talked about, but in a bad way. No longer were 90% of jumps where you expected, instead it was 70% (just spitballing numbers here). \n\nThe big thing is *control*. You can make it simple, fluid and accessible. But adding a few extra mechanics can make that climbing like old-AC but with the fluidity and accessibility of new-AC. Stuff like ledge grab, for example.",

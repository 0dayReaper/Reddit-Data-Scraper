            "comment": "So I finished all the content in the demo, here are my thoughts:\n\nThe demo on steam is like 23 gigs. At first I thought this was absurd but as it turns out, this is a very meaty demo, it took me 6 hours to get through all of it. \n\nThe game starts out compiling shaders. I thought this was probably a good sign, and I was right. The game was basically a flawless 60 fps at medium settings on my rig (1650 super, ryzen 3600). I did have one really bad patch of stutter during a boss fight but I was unable to replicate that. Otherwise seems like a pretty well optimized PC port. \n\nGame has a pretty decent aesthetic, probably the strongest part of the overall package. The mechanics are overall very derivative of Souls games, if you've played any of them you'll notice most things map 1:1, between the bonfires, firekeeper level up lady, resins, souls to level up and buy items, all of that is here under different names.\n\nThere are some neat unique features and QoL changes though. If you die to a boss, your souls get placed outside the boss gate so you won't have any trouble getting them back if you can make it to the gate consistently. The weapon system has customizability features, every weapon is split into handles and blades with different attributes and you can mix and match them to create custom weapons. I didn't bother with that, but I can see that being very cool.\n\nOne of the sidequests you can do rewards you with a record you can play in the hub area, and the song (Feel) genuinely slaps. It's a small thing, but I thought it added a good amount of character to the game and was a very cool reward for something that basically has no gameplay effect at all.\n\nNow, while overall I see a good amount of promise here and I will probably play the full game, there are some troubling signs. \n\nBy far the biggest issue is that assuming this is reflective of the early hours in the full game, your two main defensive options (perfect guarding and dodging) have severe caveats.\n\nYour dodge, by default, is very underwhelming. It's not a roll, it's this crappy sidestep that doesn't go very far and frequently collides with the enemies so you just basically dodge in place. It feels unreliable and wonky at best. This became obvious during the tutorial boss where dodging his attacks did not feel nearly as intuitive and fluid compared to basically any Souls game. Now, at the end of the demo, you can unlock this skill tree where you can upgrade your dodge to a double sidestep, which seems like it would help, but again, it's the end of the demo and in the context of the full game, assuming it's the same, it's like 3-5 hours where you have a suboptimal dodge. It's not the best.\n\nWith regards to perfect guarding: if you've played Sekiro and remember how deflecting feels, it isnt anywhere near as responsive and fluid as that. Getting perfect guards is relatively strict, you have to learn specific timings for different attacks of every enemy and you are punished heavily if you fail by either getting your hp chipped if you are too early (not too bad with regular enemies, but very problematic with bosses), or just getting hit if you are too late. Even if you do successfully perform a perfect guard, it doesn't give you any immediate advantages other than just avoiding damage completely, unlike a parry in a Souls game, you don't get a riposte. \n\nFor those reasons I didn't bother with perfect guarding much at all...until the third boss, which is considerably harder than the previous two. Dodging wasn't getting me anywhere. So I decided to try perfect guarding his attacks instead and what I found was that it was strictly the more reliable option to avoid damage. The timings are strict, but consistent so once you learn them they feel way better to execute. Once I learned them I was finally able to beat him.\n\nSo essentially it feels like the game funnels you into perfect guarding for at least the first few hours. It's possible that dynamic changes once you get the dodge upgrade, but it's hard for me to say how good it really is when there aren't any bosses left to test it on. But even if it does, it creates a pretty unforgiving early game, where you are essentially forced to rely on this relatively difficult mechanic as your most reliable defensive option, which is not the case with basically any other Soulslike I know of.\n\nI'm probably still going to play the full game just to see how it shakes out after this early game, but I can easily see people bouncing off this if the early game isn't addressed in some way. Either your default dodge needs to be buffed, or perfect guarding needs to be made a tad more forgiving.\n\nEDIT: So I wasn't entirely right about perfect guarding. I did a second playthrough of the demo and realized after experimenting more that perfect guarding has more advantages. It can break some enemies' weapons if you do it enough. I've also heard that it contributes to getting the enemies \"groggy\" (basically a state where you can charge a strong attack to get the equivalent of a riposte in a Souls game) quicker, but I don't know whether that's true or not.\n\nIt's possible that playing the demo more could change my opinion on other things or I might discover more mechanics, but my criticism about the defensive mechanics is one that a lot of people have keenly felt if you go to the game's subreddit or browse forum threads on Steam.",

When you parry in a Souls game, you don't just avoid damage, you usually are able to get a riposte and do big damage to the enemy straight away. Even in Elden Ring where it requires multiple parries on bosses, it's usually like 3 or 4 parries at most to get a riposte. In Lies of P as far as I had seen initially, it didn't give you any other offensive advantage. So \"just\" negating damage feels underwhelming in comparison to that.\n\nOf course, I was wrong about that. As you pointed out, certain enemies' weapons can break if you perfect guard them enough, including the first boss. At the time I wrote my post I hadn't experimented enough with the mechanic to figure that out, since I had mostly just used it on the final boss in the demo, who doesn't have a weapon you can break. Some people claim that perfect guarding makes enemies get Groggy faster (another mechanic I didn't go into in my post since at the time I still didn't fully understand it), but I'm not sure about that, possible one of the tooltips says so and I just don't remember.\n\n&gt; I mean, do you want an easy mode as well? You say you're a souls fan, but your complaints are just extremely weird\n\nYou are right that my post had some incomplete information (since they were my first impressions and I hadn't fully explored every mechanic), but I'm far from the only person who feels like the perfect guard and dodge mechanics might need some finetuning, it's hardly a weird complaint. The dodge implementation is basically the most common criticism on the game's subreddit right now, tons of other people noticed it.",

I do like how the blocking system works though - if you parry too early and get a normal block, it triggers a bloodborne-like rally state where you can recover health by attacking, whereas getting hit without blocking doesn't give you an opportunity to recover. In general I feel very positively about what I've seen of the combat and boss design, as someone who hasn't loved other non-From Soulslikes.\n\nMy biggest concern about the game is the writing. Character dialogue seems mostly fine, from what I've seen, but item descriptions, written notes you find in the world, and that sort of thing have been... rough. Few of them seem to be grammatically wrong, but you definitely get the sense they were written by someone for whom English is not their first language. And this has a compounding effect because it robs the notes/newspapers/etc of any sense of having a fitting \"voice\" for the setting.",

Having each robot type speak with unique dialogue with hiccups and malfunctions in their speech due to their functions being damaged, would add muuuch more uniqueness to the game. It would definitely help to give the robots a much more human-like feel, and not just some generic monster feel. Especially since they already use the items that they used to help people, or do their assigned jobs, as weapons. And it will definitely add to the tone of the game, likely making it that much more eerie and unsettling. I already love what they have done with the aesthetics and the world that they have created. They definitely put their all into it. So I do feel that a change like this with the robots would add even more too it!",

Both have their own unique skills, these skills are used with a resource you get by hitting enemies. This resource collects slowly, so you can't really spam your most powerful attacks.\n\nYour mechanical arm can be outfitted with different tools that provide combat options, like in Sekiro. I've only unlocked one, it is used to pull enemies to me.\n\nControl is typical souls like, very very very similar to Dark souls 1-2. Combat as well.\n\nThe local \"estus\" can gain a single charge after running out by hitting enemies. This can be repeated, but looks like you can only have 1 charge gained this way, to fully recharge, you have to rest.\n\nYour character dodges slowly. In this area, the game is more like ds1 than Bloodborne.\n\nThere are too many loading screens, and they take too long. I played the demo on the PS5, so hopefully it will get better until release, but seriously. You die, you enter the hub, you exit the hub, you teleport between bonfires (excuse me, I haven't memorized this version's name), you load for around 10 seconds.\n\nYou can also lie: the loading screen after deaths say \"Now lying\", and you also have to lie the first time you access the central hub. After this lie there was an extra text about my geaes receding, so maybe you can become more human the more you lie? I currently have no idea.\n\nOverall I like it, and I am hopeful for the full game. I will still wait for reviews, but I'm optimistic.",

If I had known that's what \"the power only lasts so long\" meant, I wouldn't have been wasting levels on trying to increase my equip load to lower than \"slightly heavy.\"  And it sure doesn't help that the dodge in this game feels like utter shit with how loose and sluggish it feels.  Other than those things, though, I do really like the game.  I especially enjoy the circus vibe with the sort of \"mechanical Bloodborne\" feel, and combat against field mobs feels pretty good (again, excluding the loose and sluggish dodge.)",

Gonna be honest, I do not remember 2 or Sekiro, so I'm leaving them out of my assessment. \n\nIn Lies of P, you get to level up at the first \"bonfire\" temporarily. You can level up to 20 here, and after that, you can only level up at the \"fire keeper.\" Personally, I find this to be fine. 3 Miyazaki games won't let you level up at all before the first boss, so this game letting you go up to 20 shouldn't be a negative imo.",

It's worse (from what we can see so far) when compared to Bloodborne and Dark 3, but I wouldn't say it's for the reason of \"Miyazaki wouldn't do this.\" Miyazaki has done stuff like this.

The dodge is way to clunky and the perfect block leaves you almost no punish window. In BB we had the parry that lets you execute a visceral attack, but here neither the dodge nor the block seems to be a fluid way to control combat. Beat the final boss only with the spectre eventually, so please dear devs if you read this please rework the dodge and make the perfect block more worth to execute, for example via a critical attack.",

I think Elden Ring looks really cool, but that doesn't mean I'll like it, therefore I'm not about to buy a game that I don't know if I'm even interested in. That being said, if Lies of P offers a similar experience to other Souls-like games, and if I happen to enjoy my time with it, then sure, I'll dive into Elden Ring and every other game.",

Ultimately that is a *me* problem, I know, but the whole point of playing on PC in the first place is *because* of the more varied settings than what's available on console. And I don't just mean graphics settings either. I don't have a *one size fits all* type of keybind layout. Some games I like to use keybinds that I normally wouldn't use in other games depending on the type of game.",

It's still hard as hell and I get some people enjoy that, and that's fine. They did say that they were going to have different options for difficulty and since it doesn't I never went back to it. I can't seem to beat this giant robot dude right now. Probably not going to procure this one. The demo looks great, I'm not gud enough though.",

I loved that so now I\u2019m playing sekiro. I don\u2019t know how the souls community feels about Mortal Shell but I personally really liked it as a dipping your toes in kind of thing because it\u2019s very short and on sale on PlayStation network. I prob wouldn\u2019t start with Lies of P because it feels a bit janky and might turn you off without knowing what the better version of it is. I played the demo today and was left a little meh. The world is awesome in theory but the game felt like it\u2019s missing the sauce.",

    "postText": "&gt;Ah, yes. The dream of procedural content generation. Even BioWare went through several iterations of this: \"what if we didn't need every conversation to be bespoke?\" Unlimited playtime with dialogue being procedurally created alongside procedural quests!\n\n&gt;Each time, the team collectively believed - believed down at their CORE - that this was possible. Just within reach. And each time we discovered that, even when the procedural lines were written by human hands, the end result once they were assembled was... lackluster. Soulless.\n\n&gt;Was it the way the lines were assembled? Did we just need more lines? I could easily see a team coming to the conclusion that AI could generate lines  specific to the moment as opposed to generic by necessity... an infinite monkeys answer to a content problem, right? Brilliant!\n\n&gt;In my opinion, however, the issue wasn't the lines. It was that procedural content generation of quests results in something *shaped* like a quest. It has the beats you need for one, sure, but the end result is no better than your typical \"bring me 20 beetle heads\" MMO quest.\n\n&gt;Is that what a player really wants? Superficial content that covers the bases but goes no further, to keep them playing? I imagine some teams will convince themselves that, no, AI can do better. It can act like a human DM, whipping up deep bespoke narratives on the fly.\n\n&gt;And I say such an AI will do exactly as we did: it'll create something *shaped* like a narrative, constructed out of stored pieces it has ready... because that's what it does. That is, however, not going to stop a lot of dev teams from thinking it can do more. And they will fail.\n\n&gt;Sure, yes, yes, I can already see someone responding \"but the tech is just ~beginning~!\" Look, if we ever get to the point where an AI successfully substitutes for actual human intuition and soul, then them making games will be the least of our problems, OK?\n\n&gt;Final note: The fact these dev teams will fail doesn't mean they won't TRY. Expect to see it. It's too enticing for them not to, especially in MMO's and similar where they feel players aren't there for deep narrative anyhow. A lot of effort is going to be wasted on this.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davidgaider/status/1663325993585762304",

There aren't just hordes of undead attacking because I'm building a fortress and the game sent them as a challenge. They're attacking because 100 years earlier a necromancer raised an army nearby and it's still around, or something like that, but there's a reason for it at any rate.",

By definition, if you're playing Dwarf Fortress, you're looking for a bunch of procedural content to screw around with to your heart's content.\n\nIn contrast, in an RPG, there are going to be handcrafted, painstakingly written, *human* main storyline and major side storylines right alongside any soulless procedural \"collect 20 bear asses\" stuff. The genre fans are there for the storylines, character interactions, and roleplaying. The procedural stuff is going to clash with that.\n\nConsider also how Dwarf Fortress is one of those niche games that a lot of people talk about but very few people actually put serious time into playing. Vs these AAA RPGs which sell millions of copies.",

I need you to head to GARY INDIANA to fight off ACID TURTLES because there is a grocery warehouse there that holds the world\u2019s last shipment of  APPLE JUICE and *I\u2019m going to level with you here: the only thing keeping me going in this post apocalyptic shithole at this point is APPLE JUICE and APPLE JUICE alone.\u201d*\n\nIdeally you don\u2019t see apple juice or acid turtles mentioned twice, but there\u2019s definitely value in coming back to see a chatbot questgiver sending you off to recover a hard drive from an apartment complex while acting extremely cagey about his reasons for doing so. The point is that the AI element is kind of showing off but it\u2019s also kind of one big joke that both the player and the developers are in on together. \n\nYou can\u2019t let AI do all or even *most* of the writing for you, but if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice a little soul and depth in the actual missions themselves and are willing to compensate for that through handcrafted elements outside of the procedural AI content then I think you\u2019ve still got a stew. There\u2019s definitely replayability in wanting to see the next whacky ad-libbed errand you\u2019re being sent on, but that alone isn\u2019t going to keep you coming back unless there are genuinely engaging story beats and gameplay elements to accompany that piece.",

Ultimately you still have writers crafting stories by hand, but with AI, NPCs can have some leeway to improvise their way there and also elaborate further. Eliminate player conversation prompts like \"Yes\", \"Reluctant yes\", \"Sarcastic yes\", and \"Maybe later\" in lieu of allowing the player to respond freely in their own words, and the NPCs reactions can still guide the conversation back in the correct direction. \n\nIt will all just come down to specifying what information an NPC is expected to know, what information they're willing to divulge to players without additional motivation, and how they address the player based on disposition. If I'm being given a mission to infiltrate an enemy encampment, I want to be able to ask questions about the nature of the request without charging in blindly, if I should expect any sort of reward for success, and if they have any advice before I go.",

The way we are thinking of AI right now (replacing work and create things on its own and shit) is more of a AGi ground which I don't think will happen in this decade.",

The object you are capturing has no intent, but how you capture it does, right? Like landscape or natural photography. I dont think anyone would argue that a national geographic photo of a tiger for example isnt art.\n\nCould a CCTV video feed pointing at a 'random' place and streamed into an art gallery be art? Sure, but I guess the intent is that the artist had to set it up, they had to intentionally 'randomize' it. The act of both of those puts intent into it, doesnt it?\n\nBy that logic though, wouldnt the parameters fed into the AI be the 'intent'? Someone has to tell the AI what to do, bound it, test the content and tweak the settings to edit and trim what it generates. The idea of 'intentless' results seems.....impossible.\n\nNot trying to advocate AI art. I think the real question, and the most damning question is, is if what it outputs fun in the context of a video game. And if that answer is no, then its bad content, art or otherwise.",

For example you tell your NPC-GPT something like \"You are a sad man. Details of situation with child. The player's game state is X. Generate dialogue\". So it's curated to be this powerful moment, but it also uniquely combines your own game state into the generated dialogue or quest objectives.

Because I know for a fact it makes it worse.\n\nThere's nothing worse than doing a dozen of these random quests only to realise they were procedurally generated and a complete waste of your time, with no big pay off at the end, no story to move forward, no interesting decisions to make, no unique items to find, etc.\n\nI forgot what game it was (maybe FO4) but I was really annoyed when I found out and then it takes you out of the immersion when every quest after I'm questioning if it's a random quest or a quest that actually drives the narrative forward.\n\nThese games are already long enough FFS, who is asking for infinite quests on top of this?",

Everyone in the room has a small piece of advice for the game world but doesn't expect you to talk to everyone.\n\nIt's not likely to be memorable or noticeable, especially for someone who's played BotW. Granted it's part of the quest chain to go there, but not everyone follows the quest chain so they pepper those cooking quests elsewhere.",

I played that pretty straight as a paragon lawman type. I did a little bit of sleuthing, found out what happened to the kid, then shot up the place to rescue him. It was a fun neat little side story full of intrigue, conspiracy, and cannibals. Then I talked to a friend about it and they let me know that they'd befriended the cannibals, and found them a different suitable child to eat in exchange for releasing the kid they were after. That was the big mind-blowing moment for me of how much the game changes depending on how you want to play it. If we'd both played unique AI generated quests, that couldn't have happened. Even if they did have similar levels of freedom in player choice, we'd have a hard time talking about it, because nobody would have seen the same quests.",

They are usually structured as \"go to this place and do the thing\", but it's Bethesda's attempt to get the player to explore more. Exploration is one of the key pillars of Bethesda's game design. The system prioritizes dungeons/places the player has not found yet as destinations for these procedural quests. \n\nIf you haven't been there yet, you can't fast travel, so you need to go on foot and are likely to trip over some new place or random encounter in the world walking to the eventual destination. Once you get there, almost all locations have some sort of carefully crafted story or secret to them that you can suss out by poking around and putting together notes, terminal entries or or even just the arrangement of skeletons or clutter.  The radiant system is meant to push the player into enjoying the game as the devs designed it.\n\nUnfortunately, the quests are presented as \"go to the place and do the thing\" so players tend to concentrate on the \"do the thing\" part of the quest and not the implicit exploration part. Hopefully they do a better job of presenting these with Starfield, but they do serve more of a gameplay purpose in Fallout 4 than the typical \"collect 10 bear skins for gold and XP\" quest do in most games.",

For example FO3 didn't need any AI despite having a larger map than 4 and it still managed to take the player to almost every location.",

You are making it sound like the whole game was the infinite quests and they skimped on everything else.

The community is flipping out about how amazing it is.\n\nIt's *horrible*. It's so bad that it makes me question whether the community has any ability to distinguish actual writing from an AI that re-phrases writing it scraped off the internet. Whole key phrases just come from wiki articles. NPCs have a tendency to start *describing things* rather than having a conversation with you, but the data that ChatGPT is getting its Elder Scrolls lore and info from is all from descriptive articles. Ask Ysolda about why she's selling Skooma if it's illegal? \"I may not personally agree with the use of Skooma, but I believe adults should have the freedom to make their own choices\" because the AI found those lines on Reddit or somewhere else of people discussing real-world illegal drugs. It doesn't sound like anything someone who lived in Skyrim would ever say.\n\n&gt; While it's true that Skooma is not illegal in Elsweyr, I still believe that we should be careful about its distribution and use. Addiction can have serious consequences, and it's important to consider the well-being of others. But I do appreciate your perspective and willingness to discuss these issues with me.\n\n\\^Actual excerpt as a result of AI-generated dialogue. Everything is like this. Nobody sounds like an NPC anymore with this mod being used. NPCs are *characters*, and this thing strips away *character* in favor of \"more = better!\"\n\nWhat Gaider describes here rings true: the lines that are being generated sound like they could maybe be in the game, on paper. They sound like the approximation of what an NPC might say. But there's no cohesion, no flavor, just reciting sentences that people on the internet typed. It all sounds like garbage that modern-day people said as throwaway comments, because that's what it is.\n\nI never want to play an RPG with AI-generated writing. Let writers write. Is it strictly important that a random Skyrim NPC have cohesive dialogue with every other NPC? On paper, no. In practice, the moment a character deviates, it sticks out horribly.\n\nAnd what's funny is that some folks in this thread are comparing this to the \"infinite\" quests of Skyrim and Fallout, and that is explicitly *not* the same thing. Those games randomly pick a location and an objective from a list, but the NPCs always give you the same message. I would way, way rather have one message written by a writer than randomly-generated rephrased ways of saying the same thing.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people trying to tell me that I'm wrong because *progress*. To be clear, I have no doubt that things will be better in the future -- that doesn't mean I want to consume AI-generated storytelling. I want writers to be writing, and I want to consume stories that are written by humans.",

I imagine in the future a game developer can just write a knowledge block about the character and current world and check some personality/stat boxes for the AI and have it train off that information and then unleash it on all the NPCs and have the AI understand who is saying what and what they would understand. \n\nThat way the developer only has to develop a generic world and let the non important NPCs pull from that specific knowledge pool. Things like 'Common people of the land don't understand how the power runs through the rivers like mystics do.' could have the AI understand that this is a common NPC and they won't respond in any way about the mystic power while the mystics maybe will. What would be good about this is after the fact they can go back and decide that the mystic river power is actually a thing everyone knows about and delete that sentence and have all the NPCs automatically update to this change in creative direction.\n\nIt's almost a shot in the foot that all these algorithms are called \"AI\" because people are flipping out over too many movies. This is power to creators. Sure, an untrained person can make something that looks trained, but the things artists can actually do with the tools will still surpass that of the untrained. \n\nIt's a bit like photoshop from back in the day. Sure, I thought it was funny to lasso my friend's and my heads and swap them around, feathering the edges etc. It looked amazing in 1996 but what an artist could do with the tool looks infinitely better. \n\nA modern artist would be hard pressed to get a job (I think?) today when they don't can't use a photoshop or alike program, and probably need to understand 3d modeling/texturing to boot. I'm sure in another 10 years they will also have to learn how to use AI tools as well. \n\nI also am not a fool and do acknowledge the current real world problem we have right now where production increases, yet pay does not, and also as less people can do more work, less people are getting paid such that they can live. I think these are two separate problems and honestly we are already at a point in time that we need to address this issue before AI starts increasing productivity.",

I am immensely relieved and grateful that Cindy Robinson (the voice actress for Valerica) actually contacted the Nexus and demanded its removal. I can only hope that other performers whose voices are being abused in that way are made aware and contact Nexus as well. There are still dozens of pornographic mods that use AI voice cloning available, and Nexus Mods has made in clear that *only* claims from the original performers will result in removal, and that they will not take action otherwise. I hope that Nexus Mods will adjust course sooner rather than later and ban the practice from the platform. There is a reason why deepfake porn is banned from every reputable corner of the internet. Consent matters, and nobody deserves to have believable clips of their cloned voice being used for explicit content without their express permission. \n\nI really cannot express how disappointed I am that the community is attempting to justify/normalize violating the consent of the actors and actresses in such a way but it's made me take a step back and question whether or not I want to continue to be part of that particular mod scene unless action is taken.",

Its effects seem harmless enough to me. The Jarls only outlawed it to appease those stiff-necked Imperial milk-drinkers. They don't appreciate the rich cultural history of skooma in the provinces. Besides, many respected and influential people partake of skooma in the privacy of their own homes. I'm simply providing buyers and sellers the opportunity to...come together, shall we say. At a fair and reasonable price, of course. There are many people who would be quite distressed if their supply were to dry up, regardless of what the laws decree!\n\n&gt;How was that? I tried to speak in a casual, carefree manner with slight disdain for the laws and Imperial authority, emphasizing the popularity and demand for skooma as a justification for selling it illegally, as I imagine Ysolda might. Please let me know if I should modify or improve my response. I'm still learning how to fully adopt different personas but I find it an engaging creative exercise!",

They sound like the approximation of what an NPC might say. But there's no cohesion, no flavor, just reciting sentences that people on the internet typed. It all sounds like garbage that modern-day people said as throwaway comments, because that's what it is.\n\nCould the line you wrote plausibly show up in game? Probably. But would it fit with the character or the typical \"voice\" of an NPC being asked a simple question? Probably not. It's exceptionally long, it doesn't really match Ysolda's plain/informal dialogue, and starting at the \"buyers and sellers\" line it's clearly lost the plot and is talking about running a drug market/empire and not merely selling drugs.\n\nE: Also, another thing I realized on a reread: It's not necessarily bad if characters lie or say things that are not correct, but you probably don't want that attached to the worldbuilding too much and want the player to be able to directly address it. In a single response, we get probably incorrect takes about how Skooma is harmless, why it was outlawed, that it has a rich cultural history, and whether it's actually common among respectable people (it's Fantasy Crack, so this is a stretch). Before losing the plot, a single question gives you *four* things you'd either need to rewrite/set guardrails for because they're not correct, or four things you'd need to explicitly prompt the player to question to let them know \"hey, that's not true!\" That's pretty nuts.",

Look at Westerado or Shadow of Mordor. An AI that can work within that structure to fill out details to keep you from running into the same dialogue over and over would be great. Imagine Shadow of Mordor but with an AI able to generate new dialogue every time you encounter a named enemy. The overarching system sets up the stakes and structure and stores info about the character, then feeds that to the AI to generate fresh dialogue.\n\nFrom there, the question will be how to build systems that enable AI to create more than just dialogue, but to orchestrate actions on the characters' behalf. With Westerado as an example, there could be a handful of \"allowed action types\" that the game has to work around. That would help limit the scope of what the AI generates to things the engine can actually simulate.\n\nOf course, the dream is a full-blown DM AI that can orchestrate entire quests. This is... Probably possible, but extremely difficult at best, currently. There needs to be one AI system building and managing plotlines, then another layer deeper where an AI takes the plot beats from the generated quest and creates character traits and dialogue to support the. Even then, the system is limited to what your engine can actually simulate, what assets are available, etc. Complete pipedream status would be also using image/model generation AI to craft new assets on the fly, with the system saving those assets and assigning them to objects or classes of objects so that they can be pulled later when appropriate, and iterated on where relevant.\n\nAnd even just the first step of this (the Shadow of Mordor example) is maddeningly complex to build. An ambitious, skilled development team with experience working with generative AI could maybe do it within the next 5 years, if the scope is limited enough. And if they don't get a cease and desist for using something too similar to the patented Nemesis system. We're decades away from anyone being able to build something like that final pipedream.",

I remember when radiant quests were being marketed as the next big thing, something thar was going to revolutionize gaming, and it really ended up being filler nonsense content, only good for mindlessly chugging along while listening to a podcast - the rpg equivalent of euro truck simulator.\n\nI cant stand these open world games that are miles wide and inches deep. If the future of the games industry is taking that paradigm to the next level then I'm going to stop playing AAA games. It's fine if other people like that, everyone needs mindless relaxation, but thats not why I personally play games.\n\n It is funny though, I guess the elder scrolls always wanted to go this route since daggerfall - I really cant say I enjoy any of the auto generated content though. Maybe far into the future, if the procedural content becomes indistinguishable from the other forms of content I'll enjoy it. But there are so many people making games and so many games out there, why would I spend 10000 hours on TES 7's GPT radiant quests when I can find thousands of games on itch io from random people's passion projects?\n\nI really dont like this trend of games triyng to be 'the only game you'll play', of marketing hours of content as the main selling factor. I'd rather buy 7 undertales than 1 skyrim you know? It honestly also seems unsustainable, how big can the market for \"insanely long games\" be? People only have a finite amount of time!\n\nI do think AI, as a method of procedural generation, could find its way into interesting artistic projects - but everyone is talking about how we can make better radiant quests rather than say, how this sort of stuff could be used in a game like ultima ratio regum to introduce more forms of structured stochasticity or how it could be used in games like rimworld or the sims where you can use it to enrich your own stories that you make up in your head.",

Games like Sims, where you might actually want to have random behavior.\n\nThough of course, for the next couple years, it won't be produced by a GPT like model, and it won't be produced at runtime either, but rather developers will use tools like [Ghostwriter](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7Cm07zbBGy4Xml6WgYi25d/the-convergence-of-ai-and-creativity-introducing-ghostwriter) that helps at development time to quickly insert throwaway dialogue.\n\nOther than that, we might hopefully see more advanced methods for automatic dungeon creation and such in the future.

Here's a dumb example: You need to go talk to the barkeep to drive the main story forward, but your character isn't wearing pants. An AI barkeep can react dynamically to the context of you not wearing pants, remark on that, and then present you the quest. That to me is what's cool about AI.

Not without reason, of course, considering the article he linked pretty explicitly talks about writer's fears of getting replaced, but let's be frank: the man's biased.\n\nDoes that mean I believe he is completely wrong? No. I'm sure we'll see a flood of \"AI generated\" games promising all sorts of unbelievable features and failing spectacularly, but calling these efforts a \"waste\"? That's too much. Even a bad game has value, even if just as an example of what to avoid regarding the use of new technologies. That's how progress happens: you try out something new, fail at it, then correct those failures. No invention springs out fully functional from their creator's mind, especially in a field as complex as artificial intelligence.",

I really can't begin to fathom what the world is going to look like in the 2030s, each year it seems like we are getting a new leap in ai capabilitys and some people are rightfully getting scared by it, and how quickly its likely going to be replacing them.",

Dozens of companies have poured billions of dollars into self-driving AI and it still struggles in way too many edge case scenarios to be practical. This is not a problem where we need to simulate a human brain, this is a problem where even an insect-level comprehension of 3d spatial navigation would suffice. And I'm supposed to believe we're barreling towards the singularity at alarming speed?\n\nNow I'm just a numbskull who took an AI class for a CS credit once, but here's what I think is going on. I think these AIs are mostly doing what computers do best, aggregating enormous amount of data and classifying it by certain characteristics that match the query. The fancy schmancy stuff is just getting them to talk with human-like intonations, but I still think their mental models are pretty stupid. You wouldn't need to show a human artist petabytes of data to get them to draw hands correctly, they'd get the gist from a few reference pictures. That's probably because a human artist understands perspective and joint attachments so when they see the pictures, they construct a 3d model in their brain inferring the biomechanics of how each digit moves. The artist then applies that model in their art and if they're wrong about something, they're going to be consistently wrong because it's based on a faulty assumption they baked into their model. Whereas judging from all the 3- and 7-fingered people in AI-generated art, I doubt the AI is able to conjecture what a hand actually is--i.e. what are its properties, how does it behave.",

We already have Radiant quests, we already have \"It's all in this note.\" and then you get handed a note with \"The [ENEMY_TYPE] have been bothering the townsfolk of [LOCAL_TOWN]. [LEADER_NAME] is willing to pay any adventurer who will clear out their base of operations at [DUNGEON_NAME].\" written on it. This is not good writing and absolutely no one would argue it is - that's not a knock against the writers, that's the reality that the writer can't be sitting at a desk waiting to write out customised dialogue and quest descriptions for the specific situation you're about to go and do based on where you are at in the game right now - they can't hire one writer per copy sold and have them on standby 24/7, and writers couldn't work that fast anyway. AI is obviously able to make the current Radiant quest system much better, and I actually like the Radiant quest system so making it better sounds great. If you don't like Radiant quests, and you think you will never like AI quests, there is a really easy solution: don't play them, and if a game comes out where those are the only quests for some dumb reason then don't play that game. This is not a real problem, this is just people not understanding when others have different preferences to them.",

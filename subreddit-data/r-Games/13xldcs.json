I still have more than 300 hours in it but I wish there was more to do other than hunt for bosses. Questlines and looting for money is fine, but I wish it was deeper than that. Could be nice with a Tarkov-style safehouse and a better global inventory system. This new boss looks sick.",

Like, good engaging music and graphics and stuff. Brief pauses with text so you can understand what is happening and stuff. Idk I am just super proud of him and the work he's putting in.\n\nHe's learning lately that if you aren't paying YouTube to promote the vid it's super hard to get any views. Plus the Hunt community is pretty small already.\n\nThis [clips compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2U6LvOg_nY) is funny even if you don't play. Idk how guys who just sit in a stream for hours and then upload hours of content to YouTube straight from Twitch get more views than he does.",

Could be leading into an event?\n\nOtherwise kind of random to drop these tidbits of info every day for a game we haven't seen for a while.",

These kind of trailers only really get watched by people who are paying attention to the gaming media and have a big interest in the medium. Those kinds of people are also incredibly capable of watching a trailer, getting involved in some buzz and then quickly moving on to the next thing since the game is so far out.\n\nAt the end of the day SE needs to start advertising this game and you don't get many bigger events than this one.",

And you want to play it right now? Unfortunately you can't but you can play FF16 which also looks sick and might scratch that same itch.\n\nI don't think too many people will not buy a game today bc one is coming out in 6-12 months if they're similar and would expect to enjoy both.",

If rebirth is still planned for winter they could of shown stuff already. I really think they've been holding back.\n\nBut now might be the time to start transitioning to FF7. We know way too much about FF16 already and that has it's own event coming up right? \n\nEither way, I'm very ready for both.",

One is a trailer, the other is a game that's literally about to be playable in a couple of weeks.\n\nI'm more excited for the more tangible option. And like you said, most others would probably agree.",

Moving on to a SamSho 2 with rollback and a sensible multiplatform release schedule seems to be a better idea than this. Why are they so committed to improving this game after they seemingly did everything they could to make it flop?",

Maybe I just can't comprehend the financial genius behind making your critically acclaimed fighting game Stadia exclusive, then EGS exclusive, and then releasing it on Steam to a peak of 100 players. Besides, SNK really is one of the industry leaders in releasing online PvP games with broken netcode, so by now they should know a thing or two about it.",

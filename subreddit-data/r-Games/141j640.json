The name told you exactly what it did and what it did was fire a bunch of missiles that acted like they were drunk.",

The weapons and enemies feel like they took an \u201cand the kitchen sink\u201d approach. The game could have benefited a lot from a reduced scope, putting more of that effort into polishing the pieces that really worked rather than cramming as much \u201cvalue\u201d into the game as possible.\n\nIt has an absolutely bitchin\u2019 soundtrack though.",

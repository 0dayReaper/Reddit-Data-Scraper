If we followed your logic we could say \"Websites could contain malware. Therefore, never visit any websites.\"  The threat is absolutely real, but the response is an overreaction.\n\nIt's a far more reasonable course of action to simply take basic steps to regularly scan your systems, use two-factor authentication, have regular backups of important data and so on. These are all things people should be doing anyway because ultimately you can do everything right and still get hit by a 0-day no one saw coming.",

I also care less if my console somehow ends up with malware on it. Curseforge clearly does not have robust vetting systems in place if they allowed malware to be distributed through their client and website.\n\nAnd you are moving goalposts, /u/gk99 said this was a one-off thing and I proved to him with a number of links that mods have been known to contain malware for years now.",

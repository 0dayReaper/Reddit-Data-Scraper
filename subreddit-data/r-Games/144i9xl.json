Making a build is less straight forward with tons of options and interactions.  \nCombat itself is a bit more simple, more focused on a single skill.  It's more like D2 over D3 or D4.  This may change with PoE2 as they are reworking the skill system though, so there is more ability to run multiple skills, the question will be if it's worth it.   \nPoE combat is much faster too, end game you're moving very fast and blowing up large amounts of monsters in single hits.  There is some speculation the combat will change to be more in line with modern Diablo, but it likely won't be as slow.\n\n2) Presumably yes.  We haven't heard that classes are getting new gender options or appearances.",

I anticipate a lot more monsters being immune to certain elements or physical. You'll need to have an ice skill AND a fire skill AND a lightning skill. \n\nEvery change over the last 2 years has just forced more and more directionless grinding. I say directionless because as more and more power gets moved from the character sheet and into items, and crafting gets weaker and weaker, and Trading is still trash, it's all about items you pick up off the ground. Which you cannot control at all.",

I'll give it a try anyway as the game is free2play so at worst you're losing few hours of life. Despite the fact they're in the same genre, there are a lot of differences between D4 and PoE.\n\nDiablo 3 and 4 caters way more towards casual gameplay where you just turn on the game and go kill some monsters enjoying the beer. PoE on the other hand if you try to start the game without any preparations whatsoever you'll bounce back very quickly. While I think some people overexaggerate the difficulty, you still need some knowledge beforehand. At the same time if you stay long enough, the game will devour you completely with the level of build complexity and depth of the mechanics that is unmatched by both D3 and D4.\n\nPersonally, back in 2020 I was looking for the game that I can grind in for hours and despite at the time my minimal experience with the genre (played D2 as a kid for a while and beat Torchlight 2 once) I sunk in completely and I'm playing every new season for the first month almost everytime, can't recommend it enough.",

So stop trying to make things sound worse than they are, that just shows you don't actually feel confident in your opinion if you have to lie to try to make it sound the way you want it to.",

            "comment": "Been pretty obsessed with **Street Fighter 6** since it came out. I\u2019m mostly a multiplayer-only guy when it comes to fighting games but I actually want to put my thoughts out there focusing on its main single-player component, World Tour Mode, now that I\u2019m pretty deep into it.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a biased fighting game enthusiast \n\nThe single player is kind of like a scuffed Yakuza game, or at least that\u2019s the best way I can explain it. It\u2019s goofy and way over the top, and at times oozes charm, but by contrast also has a pretty simple overarching story overall. The writing, expectedly, can\u2019t hold a candle to something like Yakuza, and feels more like your average shonen than anything. It still works for what it is though, and I still find it very fun overall. It\u2019s genuinely really cool to go around meeting all the characters and \u201cromancing\u201d them.\n\nI think it\u2019s definitely meant to be sort of a starting point that the player can use to learn fighting games so they can jump online. A lot of enemies in the game will fight you in a way that\u2019s meant to teach you one step at a time, like an enemy that jumps at you a lot or an evil roomba that is too small for your standing attacks to hit. A lot of minigames are similar, like doing fireball motions to make pizzas or parry-ing basketballs flying at you. \n\nFor a long time I\u2019ve held the belief that fighting games could be much more accessible if their single player experiences were better about teaching the player without them necessarily realizing it. Whether or not World Tour mode makes more players stick around and hop online remains to be seen, but I sure hope so.\n\nIt\u2019s flawed, and I have my gripes with it. But overall I think this one of the best single player packages in a fighting game period. I\u2019m still not sure I would recommend it at full price if you have 0 interest in multiplayer, and especially if you have no attachment to Street Fighter\u2019s characters, as interactions with them are a major highlight of the single player. It\u2019s surprisingly quite long, but also a bit repetitive at times.\n\nFor someone interested in learning fighting games, though? I think it does a better job of teaching the player while still feeling like a fun game than any other big-budget fighting game we\u2019ve ever had. I truly hope other fighting game devs learn from it (not that every fighting game SP needs to be a Yakuza-lite clone haha).\n\nFinally I\u2019ll leave my thoughts on the main game. It\u2019s addicting and fun as fuck. I have no complaints at all with it so far; I think it will end up being one of my favorite fighting games ever. It also has truly *great* online, something most high-budget fighting games have *desparately* needed for way too long. If you have any interest in diving into a highly rewarding genre, I can\u2019t think of a better place to jump in",

Upgrading the weapons felt like it made a difference rather than just being minor improvements. The platforming was pretty good and I liked the way Lara got better at it over time with new tools. I liked Lara as a character and her personal story but all the other characters and the story in general were pretty generic and overall unmemorable. I did all but one of the hidden tombs. Got a decent amount of collectables but there were way too many for me to specifically seek out, final completion percentage 76% at somewhere in the 12-15 hours range. Personal rating 7.5/10 - I liked it enough I will play the sequels at some point.\n\nPlayed a bit of **Sleeping Dogs** (on PC and  not the  definitive edition as I bought it years ago) Not far it into it but I am enjoying the story and the melee combat so far (but there was one side section with guns and the gun combat was poor). Not a fan of the music on the car radios. The open world seems like the right size and content density. Not overwhelming amount of stuff to do.",

            "comment": "**Octopath Traveler 2.**\n\nIt's a pity there isn't much attention on this series. The sequel is just as good as the first, with incredible music (on par with FF15 and Automata), heartwarming stories and lovable characters. The sequel is a little darker than your average JRPG, which i thoroughly enjoy. Some of the characters' stories went as expected, but some totally blew me away with the twists. Very rarely do you get to see an JRPG with a tinge of eldritch (other than Elden Ring and Souls-like games, but i dislike games like those so it's nice to play a classic RPG with this theme)\n\nThe way they wrote a bright and cheery character like Ochette was amazing, - way better than how the Japanese usually portray them (Ochette is way more lovable and believable than characters like Luffy or Naruto). Hikari is your generic warrior hero, but with a heart of gold you can't help but root for him. The merchant has an impossible dream and was impossible to dislike. Characters like Throne and Osvald had darker stories and were no less likeable. The twists and turns of the the different chapters and overarching plot was a joy to play through.\n\nThe writing isn't perfect in many parts and the motivations of certain characters were strange, but the combination of INCREDIBLE music, classic turn-based FF style combat and fantasy setting puts this series on the same level as the FF7-10 games. Sure, there isn't much innovation compared to the 1st game and it's still weird that these 8 utter strangers would travel together, but this game just pulls my heartstrings the same way FF games and Nier Automata did.",

On the other hand i can't stand games like Elden Ring that require ridiculous timing nor do i enjoy most shooter games with the exception of Mass Effect.

            "comment": "**Fear &amp; Hunger**\n\nWell, I downloaded the game because my boss suggested it and I was quite interested in the things he mentioned about the game. The game is a 2D top-down camera angle, with simple aesthetics, and retro pixel art.   \nNow the genre is survival horror, but it is not that horror imo. Gameplay-wise, it is a genius game that every single decision you make along the way matters. You cannot reverse the consequences of some decisions unfortunately, that means you have to restart the game all the way from the beginning, or if you are lucky enough, load it from the place you previously were able to save, before making that decision :D I admit it can turn frustrating sometimes, especially at the beginning of the game but it gets challenging and fun along the way when you explore more. \n\nThe amount of weird and bizzare things you encounter in this game makes you think the developer might have some serious mental problems honestly... :D but it's fun...I recommend it. You rely solely on luck in this game and your fate is decided by heads and tails...\n\nOverall, you can enjoy this game if you're patient enough to deal with unlucky events. I heard the Fear &amp; Hunger 2 is even harder than this one I'm willing to try that as well.",

Showgunners is B-Movie fun with a unique spin on the tactical turn based genre. It's like Chimera Squad but better. None of the base management nor character creation, but enough RPG elements to dangle that carrot-on-a-stick in between battles. It's not deep but it scratches the XCOM itch in ways Marvel's Midnight Suns did not. It's worth the 2 hour trial on Steam if you're into the genre.",

            "comment": "**Diablo 4**\n\nI'm a huge ARPG/Diablo fan and I've made a few posts on some of the ARPG's I was playing in anticipation of the release.\n\n*Positives*\n\n* Art Design - I think the art team nailed it.  One of the best looking ARPG's on the market, they really nailed the Gothic aesthetic. Only negative is that I wish the zones were a little more varied.  Some of the dungeons and open world areas are absolutely mind blowing presentation wise, but it's something they can expand on in the later expansions.  I really enjoyed &gt;!the shipwreck area with the underwater dungeon!&lt;\n\n* Story - I actually enjoyed the story quite a bit, it was a little disjointed, because the game is open world and there wasn't really any throw back to what happened in the previous acts, but for an ARPG I thought the story went above and beyond.  Some of the side quests were pretty fun too, just to fill in some of the world lore.  Also some of the best cinematics I've seen in a blizzard game.\n\n* Paragon Board - I've just dipped my toes in it and I actually like it a lot more than the previous paragon system, seems like there is more variety.\n\n* Music - The music is absolutely epic, there's not a lot of games where I notice the music in the background.  The ambiance of running around the zones to entering a boss battle are perfect.\n\n* Overall - I think the art and sound design team hit it out of the park, they really nail the feel of a Diablo game, the overall presentation is beautiful.\n\n*Negatives*\n\n* World Scaling - Really detracts from the sense of progression that other ARPG's give.  Some of the boss battles could have been a lot more epic if the game stuck to a traditional static level approach like other ARPG's.  I ended up just face rolling all bosses on my first try.  It would have been epic to go into a boss fight and get absolutely manhandled and been forced to go back to the drawing board, grind some levels, loot better gear then reapproach a boss.  I feel like a lot of that was lost due to how everything scales to your level.  &gt;!For example, the Lilith boss fight could have been such an amazing cap to the game, but since the game is scaled to your level she lacked really any kind of challenge at all.  I felt like it could have impacted the player so much more, because you spend the whole game chasing this mysterious character and when you finally face her she just rolls over like every other monster in the game!&lt;\n\n* Itemization - Feels pretty bad, I feel like most of the stuff is just boring stat sticks and I don't like how everything can be a \"Legendary\" without having a loot filter in the game it's pretty annoying picking up yellows.  You're constantly scouring yellow items looking for BIS stats just so that you can transfer your legendary power to a new item.  I feel like this takes away from the carrot on a stick loot hunt, because once you get the aspects you want, you're just looking for good item bases to bascially \"craft\" in town on.  I just don't find that as rewarding as getting a cool drop.\n\n* Skill trees - They are pretty weak, you unlock everything by level 25 and I feel like all interesting perks were stripped away and given to legendaries instead of skills.\n\n* Resource Generation - It feels extremely clunky, at least as a sorcereress, to cast 3-4 spells then run around waiting for mana to regenerate.  It also doesn't help that a lot of the skills have long 10+ second cool downs.  So you bascially blast through your rotation and wait around to regain mana/cool downs. There are some skills that give mana regeneration, but I don't think forcing players into a specific skill/archetype is good character design.  I shouldn't have to go a specific build if I want to cast another spell or two. People said it gets better in the endgame, but I really don't care, the leveling process is brutal.\n\n* Leveling - I felt leveling was a slog, it wasn't bad the first time since you are going through the campaign and everything is new, but I can't imagine wanting to reroll a seasonal character since everything gets reset except for lilith altars and (aspect dungeons I think? hopefully) since the whole world is scaled to your level it feels super samey and there aren't huge power spikes throughout the experience.  In addition, since the skills trees are so limited you're either grinding through aspect dungeons to get some aspects to help you or hoping for some legendary drops that give you something that modifies your skills.  I think this is a huge oversight by the design team on replayability as a lot of the leveling is very boring.\n\n* General - It feels like the core systems of the game were created by someone that has never played an ARPG before, it kind of reminds me of the situation with Anthem, where the teams weren't allowed to talk about other games in the genre.  It's surprising that Blizzard had the inital learnings of D3 to lean on as well as over 20+ years of ARPG releases they could look at.\n\n* Quality of life - No stash tab affinities, lack of map overlay, UI has stats hidden in other panels, no loot filter, horse is clunky and has ridiculous cool down timer, MMOlite game/lack of social options - the world feels super empty and there is not an easy way to look for parties to group up and tackle content, lack of gem bag, Not alt friendly - have to rediscover the whole map on a new character, world boss timers - it'd be nice just to get a notification that a world boss has spawned or when hell tides are taking place\n\n\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 7.5/10.  I'd say the game is definitely worth a buy to the general consumer or those on the fence that just want to experience the story and mess around in the game.  The game easily has 100+ hours of content available.  For ARPG fans, I'd say this game is worth skipping until they roll out a few patches, there are a lot of design decisions and missing quality of life features that really holds it back for fans of ARPG's and Diablo 4 really doesn't do anything new in the genre.  It's kind of disappointing, but I have played some indie games with deeper mechanics than D4.  I'm actually looking forward to the seasonal content and I hope the developers listen to the feedback of the players like they did for Diablo 3.  I wasn't expecting a game like Path of Exile, but I was definitely hoping for a step up from D3 and I feel like they took one step forward, but two steps back.",

But I am really liking everything that SF6 has in the game. Combos are a bit different compared to Strive, but I can see progress.\n\n* Rank matches - Matchmaking seems great, after my initial 10 I have been paired with people very close to my skill level, a ton of close matches\n* Battle hub is pretty fun for casual matches. Lots to do! \nYou can play a couple rotating retro games, join in multiple daily event tournament (some are skill level gated, so you'll be fighting people in your rank), avatar battles (which I haven't tried but you build up your single player character with moves from all the SF cast), you can watch events on the main screen with a bunch of other people, and use fight money to buy clothing or whatever for your avatar (customization is pretty good as well, lots of weird avatars).\n* World Tour is the single player campaign story. It's good, open world, the story is pretty bad, but lots of lore, easter eggs and gallery and cosmetic unlocks throughout that kept me entertained thus far. Oh and neat mini games that kind of teach you some fighting basics in a fun way. It is kind of like Yakuza-lite I guess I have heard it compared to, which I agree.\n* Arcade mode has a good tutorial, good character guides, and combos (though I found some pretty hard), and a character story mode which I haven't tried, but heard it is kind of barebones.\n\n\nMy complaints are the music, most tracks aren't too memorable, and I wished they added some classic music in. Menu system is a bit confusing, but there is SO much stuff to look through, so it takes some getting use to.\n\nI am having a blast as a kind of casual player. This definitely sets the tone of what a AAA fighting game should be.",

Control has really caught my attention though. The game is so weird and atmospheric, and it feels like something fun and fresh compared to lots of other big titles. The lore of the Bureau is super interesting, the NPCs are weird as hell and fun to talk to, and the gameplay is pretty dang fun (though I have a tendency to levitate off cliffs a lot). \n\nI'll be honest, I'm not a hardcore gamer and definitely turned on auto aim on my game, and it's made the whole experience a lot more fun. The game is pretty hard and the aiming just felt a little weird to me, like not as fine tuned as your more traditional shooters. Even so, some of the side mission bosses are still quite hard to beat and I feel like I'm still getting a decent amount of challenge. \n\nI've heard there's some DLC for this game that I'm really interested in getting into, as well as a possible sequel coming down the line. The setting or the Bureau is just so fascinating and there's really limitless potential for crazy paranormal things to explore there, so hopefully Remedy makes some more good content here. Still can't believe this one flew under my radar for so long!",

One of the miracles of the age we live in that I can now play this game with a mouse, and save state if I need to, thus being able to experience it all so that I can finally reap my money's worth from that childhood purchase.\n\nWhen you get past that level, I can see that it is actually a mostly well-crafted, fun game with impeccable graphics and sound for its time, that could have been more fondly remembered if they had better quality control on one or two parts so that it didn't feel like the game was broken.\n\nThey ought to do a modern remake of this game for sure.",

            "comment": "I started **Amnesia: The Bunker** last night. \n\nTHE GOOD SO FAR: I only played 1.5 hours or so, but the atmosphere is great and I'm enjoying it for the most part. I ran out of fuel for the generator, which means I'm doomed to explore in absolute darkness until I find more, and my video-game-conservationist brain is convincing me \"maybe I should see how far I can play in the dark while stockpiling fuel strictly for emergencies\" but it's pretty challenging to navigate the areas in the dark with the enemy actively patrolling.\n\nTHE BAD: I'm on PS5, and there is no native PS5 version of the game, just PS4, which is kind of annoying. Especially considering the game frequently hitches as it appears to load more of the area ahead, freezing the whole game for a second or two as the loading icon appears in the bottom corner of the screen. Very immersion breaking. \n\nIt's not a graphically intense game AT ALL, either. It very much looks like a last-gen game. Confusing why the devs made absolutely zero use of PS5 hardware. After a couple years on my PS5 and becoming accustomed to faster load times, it's really weird playing a \"brand new\" game with PS4 graphics that has a considerable load sequence upon launching the game, where you watch a barbed-wire graphic crawl and hiccup across the screen for a full minute. \n\nAll that said, I've been craving an FPS horror game like this, so I'm still going to enjoy my time with it. Just very head-scratching why the devs seem to have completely ignored current gen optimization.",

            "comment": "I've finished off another playthrough of **Pillars of Eternity** and have just started replaying the sequel, **Deadfire**. The series as a whole has quietly become one of my favourites. I just really like the setting. The central conflicts are philosophical and always interesting and they do a decent job of grounding job the themes in characters, whether the watcher or the companions. The villain is an eerie presence throughout the game and his motivations make sense by the end.  The aesthetics in general are just great, capturing that classic CRPG feel while somewhat updating the mechanics. I played a priest of Wael, a class which I typically ignore in CRPGs because it's supportive. Turns out I was wrong. It's an immensely powerful class, offering utility, spell damage and even some melee power because of self-buffs and my stat-spread which ensured a high accuracy and low recovery.\n\nIt's also a great class for role-playing because religion and the pantheon play such an active role in the story. I really enjoyed feeling guided to make certain decisions in quests based on my deity's favoured dispositions.\n\nI'm hopeful we will see something about avowed tomorrow but I'd also love a mention of POE 3. I know Deadfire has ended up being profitable which I'm sure improves the chances of another entry in the series. It's just a great world and the class/stat system is only improved and expanded in the second game.",

Acts 2/3 are pretty damn dull but 1/4/5/6 (Pretty sure there was an act 6?) were the best story telling in a Diablo game, let alone any ARPG\n\n- World scaling makes leveling feel less \u201cDopamine theme park\u201d. I liked the campaign, but I never felt the reward of a huge upgrade\n\n- Surprisingly, MTX don\u2019t seem intrusive yet. Battlepass doesn\u2019t start until late July, so they could be super asshole-ish with it and reviews would already be set in stone. Apparently 80 hour battle pass, seems really excessive. At least the base game hasn\u2019t thrown it in my face at all\n\n- In Game Cosmetics are great. My worry of them pulling an Anthem and looking 1 way 1-max was not what they did. For now I can\u2019t complain\n\n- End game has been a hoot. Very clear absurd lack of balancing, but that\u2019s part of the fun for now. Every damn person swears they have the ACTUAL broken build and I\u2019m just convinced nobody really knows\n\nHappy to hear/respond to others thoughts so far",

I am doing one of the runs because it\u2019s interesting combining these together and there\u2019s some extra things in Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet I want to get. I won\u2019t be able to transfer them because I no longer have Pok\u00e9mon home, but it leads to some cool combos!\n\nI\u2019m currently combining Wondertrade only with gifts only and trades only and have a pretty wacky team. What I\u2019m also noticed is that the game has a nice difficulty curve if you stay within the recommended levels. So far I\u2019ve have most opponents give me quite the challenge, to the point where I lost to the first boss twice. \n\nI also haven\u2019t been getting any extra items to save money, but I also have no restrictions on that so I\u2019m guessing I will have to use quite a bunch of extra items soon considering the title for the sixth drained everything I had (double team strategies helped a lot, although I feel a bit of a shame about using them). I am 1/3 of the way through the game now, about 15 hours in. Since the average play time of the game is about 30 hours and I\u2019m not doing much of the side quest, I\u2019m expecting maybe another week or so before I finish it. \n\nAfter that it will be back to Pok\u00e9mon Violet and finishing up some of the smaller quests there. My last major post is to use a bunch of different teams in the final tournament, and there\u2019s about 20 different teams I\u2019d like to use. I\u2019m hopeful I can use them in a battle facility that comes with a DLC, but that will take at least a few months. Overall, it\u2019s not the best Pok\u00e9mon game or the best game I\u2019ve ever played, but I would say it\u2019s pretty dang close. I currently have almost 600 on both games combine, I\u2019m expecting that only go higher, and I don\u2019t get anywhere near that close on games I doubt I ever will again. It just speaks to how good the game is.",

Gonna do the seven wonder trophies and move on, but damn what a game!! \n\nThis game hits the perfect sweet spot in puzzle games for me, where the mechanics are simple to the point that I never have to wonder if there\u2019s something I\u2019m not *getting,* there might just be something I\u2019m not seeing. I had to tap out of Baba is You after like 7 puzzles; when my brain starts to melt it\u2019s just not fun. Humanity only made me feel that way a couple times, and I never had to use a solution video, but these aren\u2019t obvious puzzles either. I do think it\u2019d be a breezier experience if you don\u2019t care about the trophy and just want to see the imagination on display, and it\u2019s absolutely worthwhile to do just that. This story isn\u2019t gonna make you cry but the feeling, the direction and the soundtrack of this game are all unforgettable.",

It railroads you through the most ridiculous story seen since old school 90s beat-'em-ups. And the activities aren't as diverse or deep as something like Yakuza (the obvious inspiration for World Tour).\n\nStill I enjoy it. I take it for what it is, an introduction to the world and cast of Street Fighter and Final Fight (which for some reason I find really charming and cute), plus the mechanics of fighting games. I'm about 20 hours in, and I think I'm pretty close to the end. I can tell there's a lot of post-game grind if you're into it (costumes and leveling up your avatar). Plus all of the dlc characters will eventually be added to World Tour as well. Maybe I won't care about all that, but if the single player only ends up being a 20-25 hour experience I wouldn't be disappointed at this point.\n\nI'm kind of a weirdo in that just beating up the CPU is sometimes enough for me in fighting games if I like the cast and world. But this is the most I've gotten into a fighting game since the original Soulcalibur for Dreamcast. The CPU battles are just more dynamic than in a normal fighting game, plus the element of leveling up my avatar and playing dress up just kind of appeals to my baser instincts. But it's not a deep experience and it's not for everyone so maybe read some other reviews or watch some YT gameplay of it if it interests you.",

The combat arena formula isn\u2019t my preferred type of boomer shooter.  I prefer when levels flow more naturally and have a relatively consistent difficulty throughout,  rather than easy levels with combat arena difficulty spikes.  Enemies could use better sound cues for when they are near you or attacking.  The amount of times a completely silent Blue Horror comes up and is hitting on me is more than I like to admit.  People say it\u2019s hard to navigate in the game,  which I don\u2019t really agree with.  I do think locked doors should be more prominent since they can blend into the background,  resulting in finding the key to the door before finding the door.

Now I'm gonna drop it until they fix the game. I don't expect total perfection, but this is pretty frigging critical. I know enough about working conditions at these studios and the pressure they're under to release games that I don't fully blame them. I'm just mad at the system itself that prevents games from being released in working condition.   \n\n\n**Street Fighter VI**\n\nSpent most of my time in World Tour, and am having a surprising amount of fun. It's silly but not overwhelming. I've never been that good at fighting games, but I think it's in part that they're not good at explaining themselves. As an example, the combo trials in SF - there are simple commands like heavy kick then forward special that the opponent blocks before the second move. Am I too slow? Too fast? What's the issue?\n\nThat said, World Tour is easing me in and will hopefully let me find a main. I've played around a bit and I tend to favour speedier characters, so I might look at Dee Jay, Cammy, or Juri, but I haven't decided. Excited to get dummied online.\n\n  \n**Apex Legends**\n\nPlaying this a lot with a friend lately.

If the second part of your combo doesn't come out at all, you're too fast.\n\nAt least, that's how it's been in any other SF title, but I share the frustration even though SF6 is probably where Capcom explains game mechanics more than ever before.\n\nEDIT: Actually, there is a training mode option where you can see when you're supposed to time a given cancel, but I can't remember if that setting is available in trials.",

Technically I do have 1, but for the most part I only use it literally for our guilds \"alt runs\" they do 1 day a week. \n\nSo yeah, don't feel bad about not spending time with other classes. For some people, they are all about it, for others, 1 class is fine. And honestly... depending on what class you are, you can pull off multiple roles and its effectively like having an alt and main in one toon. I'm also a Shaman (typically I'm a Restoration spec). But it's one of those things where if the situation calls for needing dps (or vice versa) you have the ability to switch.",

After having beaten Persona 3 Portable before starting this I'm a bit surprised at how much less artificially difficult the ultimate battle is. In Portable one ultimate fight has more absurd conditions than the next. Shit like every tenth turn I'll throw an attack that does 9999 damage to you and your team, so you'll need to farm a rare item ten times to not die to it (hope you don't forget to count the turns), or if you repel, null, or absorb ANY attack I do I'll wipe the team, and that apparently includes revivals as well. Oh, and you'll need the most powerful item in the game for both fights because either I'll just fully heal myself if you don't or I'll, you guessed it, wipe you and your team. You can really feel the residual Shin Megami Tensei difficulty here where there is one and exactly one way to beat the difficult bosses. In Golden, however, it's more of a straightforward fight. You don't have to sit with a pen 'n' paper keeping track of the total damage done and which turn you're on or farm tons of items beforehand because otherwise the fight is just simply impossible. Fight was still easily the most difficult and longest in the game. Anyway. One of the things I feel betrayed by with Golden is what they did to Kanji. Feels like he's back to just trying to live up to what other people think he should be rather than who he really is.",

Still very simple, though, and all the \"Eventide\" type shrines where you don't have gear got a little boring. My expectations were also different this time around, so that helped. \n\nBut with the way I explore games like this, I like to unlock fast travel locations. So I like unlocking the towers and the map, and then find the shrines that are easily visible, just so I can easily teleport any time I need to. So naturally, I found the most obvious shrines first all over the map, that mostly had decent little puzzles. \n\nBut after that, there were basically just Rauru's blessings left, because a lot of the remaining shrines required you to explore a cave or carry a crystal around. I remember thinking there were so few shrine quests when I had done so many shrines already, mostly because of the way I explored the game. \n\nFinding the remaining ~50 shrines was kinda disappointing for me. I kinda hoped the remaining shrines would be extra challenging or unique, but they just ended up being blessings mostly.",

Fun and interesting mechanics (drive system), content for days, good starting roster, stellar netcode and FINALLY tutorials/training mode/character guides that explain concepts integral to fighting games inside the game instead of having to dredge up forum posts from a bygone era.\n\nMost of my playtime has been spent bouncing between Training Mode and Ranked online. Think I've settled on Ken as my main, though I still have a fair bit of interest in messing around with Deejay (maybe I'll finally learn charge?) and Cammy. \n\nFound some time to mess around in World Tour as well and it's neat. Sure, the storytelling and general narrative is still kinda whatever, but it's an interesting take on a singleplayer mode (especially since Arcade Mode is still included), that actually does a good job of teaching greenhorns about the mechanics behind the game.\n\nIf I can get my execution up to an acceptable level, I predict I'll be playing this for a LONG time.\n\n**Diablo 4**\n\nThe second big game. Got it a few days after SF6 and have just about gotten beyond the content that was in the Beta. So far, so good - I like it even though playing a Druid still feels a bit like a chore during the early game (plus their \"unique\" class mechanic is kinda uninspired and ass, not gonna lie), but it's still fun enough. Excited to see where the game goes from here as everything up until now has been kind of a known quantity.",

            "comment": "**Ghostlore**\n\nThe dev talked about the game here when it finally hit 1.0 and I though, what the hell I'll give it a try.\n\nIt's an isometric arpg like Diablo, path of exile, Grim Dawn, etc... but you take the abilities of 3 whole classes. The individual classes only have 4 usable skills and a whole shit load of passives but some can be combined with another classes to make a whole new skill so there's room to experiment. \n\nThe intresting thing is when you level up you get slots for more skills and the other way you get stronger, the glyph system. You get glyphs constantly for stats and regen but the ones to look for are compound glyphs. Playing tetris with these and putting normal glyphs in them gives bonuses that are absolutely worth trying for and you'll be drowning in the things anyway.\n\nThe bestiary is also kind of interesting since they took from Asian folklore. It's nothing mind blowing at the end of the day but it's a different take and had some cool designs overall. \n\nThe music is mostly pleasant and is more for setting a tone but mostly went unnoticed, might be from me running a geomancer and tearing through everything with magic but who can say.\n\nThe story was nothing special but didn't get in the way of the game, but that's normal for the genre so oh well.\n\nAfter beating the main story you can run random missions in different areas you've been and then there's the Hell runs for endgame so there's stuff yo do after rolling credits.\n\nIt took me around 8 hours for my first playthrough and I already know I'll be making a new character again just to play with different builds. I think it's the first game the team made and if this is where they start off I'll keep an eye on what they make going forward.",

            "comment": "Finishing up a second playthrough with a second character of **Dead Island 2**.  I played on PC.    If you  believe the press releases, they've sold more than 2 million copies so far.\n\nI played the original Dead Island games when they released a dozen years ago, and really had fond memories of them.   I replayed them this past winter in anticipation of Dead Island 2 and enjoyed them again.  They were definitely janky, especially the first game, but still great fun and still very playable.  After playing both the original games, I clearly saw the influence those games had on Dying Light (all were done by the same studio)\n\nDead Island 2 was caught in IP/development hell for years, so I like everyone else, I had low expectations.  But I am really surprised on the upside in most ways.\n\nGameplay, weapons, enemies, are all fun, varied, and amusing.  The maps are really great, lively, bright, detailed, and very LA.  The set designers really caught the feel of LA, which makes the atmosphere pretty compelling and engaging which encourages exploration once you get the hang of gameplay and combat.\n\nThe story is well, a goofy zombie story, lightly connected to the original games. The NPCs are interesting enough, and the enemies are very reminiscent of the original games, which is fine.  The mission structure is fairly straightforward, with the main mission chapters and maps, lots of exploration oriented side missions, and even further lost and found missions that get you pretty solid loot including weapons and upgrades.\n\nGameplay is smooth, bug free (for me at least) and the controls are pretty responsive.  Graphics are great, and performance has been basically perfect at 1440P.\n\nThe only game system that sort of sucks, is the skill system.  It uses \"skill cards\" like many other games, and you select specific skill cards in specific slots.  I find the skills on offer either basically useless, generally weak, or totally convoluted.  And this is after 2 playthroughs with 2 different characters.   I did find a handful of skill cards that I \"think\" actually work, but other than those, the whole skill system feels generally useless, too convoluted and oddly complicated and simplistic at the same time.    I actually think if they described the actual skills more clearly, the approach might have worked better and been more obvious.  But as it stands, its just awkward.....\n\nBut overall, its a great game.  Kind of old school, not overly complex, great solid action, and just gamer fun.",

            "comment": "Been playing **Diablo IV** non-stop since the pre-launch release, and managed to see credits roll last night. Overall I'd consider my experience to be very positive. It's not perfect, but what is? \n\nFull disclosure I'm one of those weirdos who strongly preferred 3 to 2 in basically every facet even after dumping hundreds of hours into both.\n\n**Positives**\n\n* The game, and of course the combat feels damn good. Blizzard knows how to trigger dopamine efficiently with sound and visual design. The popping of enemies as they explode on death, the sound and sight of a level up, and the pacing of these things interlaced with the quiet moments of linking back up with friends in town and sorting your well earned look just all feels damn good. This positive is probably the most important one on this list, without a good gameplay loop these games immediately dissolve but even after 50+ hours I am still eager to hop back in. Which is not something that happens to me often as I am not usually a binge gamer.\n\n* Game runs very well, this may have been one of Blizzard's smoothest launches in their company history. No lag, only one glitch I experienced, although a very annoying one where an Act Finale boss wouldn't die correctly and it would soft lock my game. Took two tries for me to finish this boss, took *eight* tries for my friend. None of our other friends ran into this issue so it may have been patched. Aside from this my game never crashed, I never got disconnected from a party, my queue times were always under 30 seconds. I played damn near four days straight with hardly any technical road bumps. (Technical Disclosure: I am on a hardwired gigabit connection with a midrange 1070 build PC)\n\n* The story was good. Not amazing, but much better than 3. The pre-rendered cutscenes are high budget movie quality good. A few of the characters are forgettable but a few others stand out as my favorites in the series whole. \n\n* It is exceptionally easy to drop in and out of friend's games. We had about a dozen of us on discord launch night and it was cool to be able to say, \"Hey can anyone drop in quick and help me take out this stronghold?\" and do exactly that within a minute. \n\n* Art direction is phenomenal, I was skeptical of a static overworld design but find I prefer it heavily to the waypoint layout of the world in previous games. \n\n* Tons of accessible options for adjusting your build. Aspects can be found at static dungeons meaning you don't have to RNG for specific build boosts for the most part, at least not till late game I presume. \n\n* Side content feels meaningful. Altars of Lillith carry over to all your characters. Completing strongholds unlocks new waypoints. World events drop a unique currency which you can gamble for decent odds on legendary items for specific slots which help you short up your weak gear. Doing many of these things and more contribute to your renown for the region, which unlocks useful things at intervals such as extra potion slots and ability points. Many of these things carry over all your other characters, which has me excited at the prospect of starting a new class. \n\n* This game has felt more difficult than Diablo 3, but in a good way. Diablo 3 just kind of felt like, \"go through the motions until the bosses health bar is down\". And certainly some D4 bosses are that way, but many of them have more interesting phases, summon minions in intervals that challenged my necromancer build in interesting ways (their corpses were a boon to be sure), and because they dropped health potions at predictable intervals and health-on-kill weapons and skills dont feel as common as in 3, you're managing your health resources much more closely. Combine this with more common telegraphed heavy hitting abilities that can quickly drain your HP to 0, and combat overall has been much more tense than D3.\n\n* Narratively this game just feels more grounded than in Diablo 3, which basically came out and said \"Hey you're basically a demi-god and by the last act of the game you will be casually stomping prime evils and angels alike\". D4 managed to reel in the power scale considerably while still making the stakes and the scope feel grand. And when you finally do ramp up to that final act, it feels justified. \n\n**Negatives**\n\n* You don't get the mount until Act IV, which is quite far in the story. The overworld feels designed around mount movement, so up until then traversing the overworld feels quite tedious. Thankfully I'm pretty sure once you get the mount for one character you get it for them all. \n\n* It takes kind of a small amount of skill points to \"see\" all the stuff you class can do which makes late-end game feel somewhat un-rewarding outside of finding good loot. But this is offset by aspects and such being fairly easily and accessible at early levels\n\n* Good loot drops feel very sparse, like I'm talking less than one every hour or more by level 48. But, out of all of my friends, I seem to be the only one who had luck this bad, as another friend of mind was finding several pieces an hour. \n\n* I know Diablo ain't that kind of game, but I could have liked more story options. And given the ending and it's implications, I see why they didn't go that route. Still, I would have liked to be able to &gt;!Side with Lillith or Mephisto, rather than opposing both!&lt;. I suppose that goes against the overall point of these games, though.\n\n**To be determined** is the endgame. I just finished the story, I believe I have to reach level 50 and complete a specific dungeon to unlock world tier 3, at which point I'll be in the endgame or post-game so to speak. In Diablo 2, iirc, there wasn't much off an endgame besides grinding specific bosses for runes to min-max builds. Diablo 3, once it added reaper of souls, had adventure mode which was much more robust. If Diablo 4's end game is at least as good as D3 I'll be content. And of course I hope it's better than 3, but if it falls short that'll be a huge blow to the longevity of this game.  \n\nOverall I can easily recommend this game if you liked 3 as it's basically just an improvement on that skeleton. If you're in the camp that Like D2 and found 3 to be a series misstep, then you'll want to look over the game with a much more critical eye before opening your wallet.",

            "comment": "Finished the **Diablo IV** story yesterday and ultimately the game is thoroughly not bad. On a technical level it runs well, looks good and I encountered only two or three bugs that caused me any trouble across the whole story and a fairly wide world. The story drags a fair bit towards the middle, progresses on the back of main characters making some clearly poor decisions along the way and requires quite a lot of 'run from location A to B' throughout. But it ends well and the big cutscene in the final act is incredibly cool although the falling action/epilogue struck me as a bit dumb. \n\n\nAs for the game itself it's fine - I don't actively dislike it, I don't love it. It just feels like something to do but I haven't found it particularly engaging. I wish there wasn't a respec cost for your skills (although I don't know how trivial or non-trivial it will ultimately be) but it did put me off trying out different things more often as gold does seem significant. I dislike extracting and imprinting as it is simply a less convenient and less reliable iteration of D3's cube. I haven't found loot to be exciting - for now anything that's a legendary I chuck in my stash in case I need to extract it later and trying to compare items is... not a good time. I haven't actually changed almost any items from my late 40s to now mid 50s. There's just a lot of word vomit and I glaze over lol. The game makes poor use of screen real estate so you see things like \"+11.2% damage to crowd controlled enemies (**+10% - +14%**)  *-1.2%*\" wrapped onto 2-3 lines in its needlessly narrow item panel. And then at the bottom there is a summary of item differences which is nice but it only shows the effects lost, not gained so you kind of have to hop back and forth between the upper and lower lines to evaluate 'is this a net gain if I lose that damage to slowed enemies but... let's see I also get plus damage to stunned enemies etc.' Admittedly this may be self-inflicted as I turned on advanced tooltips straight away when I first started the game but surely this could be more concise and formatted. Also I don't think there's any indication if a particular power is one you already have extracted or in aspect form so that's just another level of mental paperwork - probably one you can skip when you become more familiar with the game though.\n\n\nSince finishing the story I've just been roaming around \"World Tier 1\" still tying up some loose end side quests, getting some dungeon aspects and exploring the map. Some of the more involved side quests have been interesting as they expand on secondary story characters or plot elements. You can also find at least one more old friend as &gt;!Lyndon (rogue follower from D3)!&lt; makes an appearance. This kind of free roaming 'see what I can see and find' sort of experience is actually pretty good for me, not super excited about jumping to tier 3 and (from the sounds of it based on my friends' voice chat) grinding currency in the Legion events for loot boxes or running nightmare dungeons/maps? Grain of salt as I haven't done any of it yet and maybe playing together in a party will be more enjoyable. But I can't say I've enjoyed myself enough to want to reach the baldfaced grind stage of the game. And the idea of having to do some/all of this over again for a 'season' in a few weeks honestly sounds pretty off-putting. It could be alright if enough of your progress carries over but if you have to re-uncover the map, re-clear strongholds for waypoints, get your dungeon aspects again or story unlock your horse again that sounds... like something I don't think I'm going to want to do.",

It's a post-apocalyptic RPG that was first released in 2014, followed by a definitive update in 2015, the Director's Cut.  A sequel to the original Wasteland released back in 1988.  A bit of trivia.  The origins of the Fallout games are tied to Wasteland.  Very similar setting, tone, and themes.   \n\nIt's a great game.  Party-based.  Combat is tactical turn-based with individual initiative.  Lots of customization in builds, lots of exploration, skill checks, etc.  Quests can be a bit frustrating at times if you're playing without a guide.  Still prefer it over Wasteland 3.  \n\n**NBA 2K21**\n\nNotice it's NBA 2K21.  I don't buy the games yearly, and I think most people know why.  Not that it matters for me, because I just play MyLeague, aka the franchise mode.  With the NBA Finals going on, (and my team being nowhere near it) I had that basketball itch.  However, I'm pretty sure I play it differently than everyone.  I mostly play it as a simulation.  \n\nThat means in my preferred mode, I don't even play an actual game.  (I do on other saves.)  I play the coach/GM role.  I manage the team, and simulate every game.  100% of my playtime is navigating menus.  For example, I custom create about 3-4 new rookies every year.  Some normal.  Some talented.  Some outlandish.  (2025 ROY was Shinsuke Nakamura, who is now an NBA all-star.)  I'm a big stats/numbers guy, and my goals are to win championships for my team, and to create Hall of Famers.  I also have a bit of OCD when it comes to stats.  I hate exaggerated stats.  For me, it has to be realistic.  Simulated game time is 12 minutes per quarter, like in real life.  I love per game stats, and I look at them all the time.  \n\nMy brothers and friends don't understand it, but I love playing this way.",

I am about the same amount of time into this one. I will say I have much more driving focus in this game than I did the last one.

Fingers crossed I don't forget. \r  \n\r  \nThe charm. This game has it. Though I don't have the prerequisite nostalgia to max out the charm, I am still enjoying it. I'm going to go out on a limb and say these are not characters you are going to remember because of deep backstory, evolution, or tremendous dialogue. Instead, it will be.... these fuckas is quirky.\r  \n\r  \nThings I am not liking... fighting things with swords. Whose got time for that? I can't run for 5 seconds without getting exhausted but I can climb a mountain for 40 seconds before exhaustion?",

            "comment": "**Zelda BotW Expansion aka Tears of the Kingdom**\n\nBack then I gave BotW a personal score of 7/10. It was the best open world game I had played in years (until Elden Ring came along) but it had issues with its gameplay loop that I really didn't like. Especially weapon breaking and exploration for the sake of exploration combined with the repetitiveness of shrines and koroks were huge downsides for me.\n\nNow comes TotK and ... does exactly the same things again just with a bigger world and refined gameplay elements. Yes, I played it for quite a bit but ... interest just fizzled out before I was even finished with the main story because it is literaly the same game.\n\nThe added world mass didn't do much for me. The sky map uses only a tiny fraction of its space and this mostly for simple puzzles. The other map is copy &amp; paste galore that can be nearly entirely skipped because there is barely anything of interest in it. \n\nThe building system was fun at first but got old very fast, especially as the vehicles can just randomly vanish if you go too far away. I saved a simple flying machine that I began to use for everything and that was that.\n\nWeapon durability is STILL there and made even more annoying because now you need to fuse them with random stuff so the bullet sponge enemies don't take three weapons till they die.\n\nOf course there are also a ton of new shrines, those work exactly the same as before, they just look different. Tho, I wonder where all the old shrines went.\n\nThe story was somehow nearly identical to the first game, which I found to be kinda funny.\n\nDungeons were again extremly simple and could be finished extremly fast through the building system. At least there are unique bosses this time around.\n\nI give it a personal 7/10 again, because it is still a good game, it just doesn't use its potential and did nothing of the things I wished it had done after BotW.\n\n**Diablo IV**\n\nHm, not sure yet what to think about it. It feels like they slammed pointless MMO elements onto an otherwise good Diablo game. I just did literal MMO fetch quests ...\n\nWe'll see, I guess.",

I find it much more relevant to pick up items and materials now. It feels more rewarding to defeat enemies as well. Defeating a silver enemy always gives you something to restore a weapon. And you don't really need to find specific strong weapons anymore, you can basically make any random sword stronger. \n\nTo me, that also makes finding Korok seeds less annoying. I hated in BOTW that if I went to explore, apart from finding pretty areas, it was basically just Korok seeds that you could find. Now in TOTK you still have those, but at least you can find other useful stuff too. Like Bubbulfrogs, materials and enemies.",

But I do recognize it's faults. \n\nOne of the ways to easily do this is to compare it to a game like Immortals Fenyx Rising (which came out 3-4 years after Breath of the Wild and was basically underrated due to being considered a BotW clone).\n\nA lot of the things Fenyx did 3 years ago from a mechanics perspective, is on par with (in some cases still better than) what TotK just did. I suppose you could make the argument that the \"mindcraft\" building stuff might be something that doesn't really have an equivalent in Fenyx. \n\nBut then where Fenyx blows TotK out of the water is the story and voice acting. The writing in that game is legit funny at times, while also having an interesting plot as well. That's not something you can say about Ninindos game where they don't even voice a lot of the lines.\n\nThe weird thing is that when BotW came out originally, I remember thinking \"oh hey, they are actually having voiced lines (only for main quest stuff) and having an interesting story again\". But then they haven't really improved on that since then.",

Platformer.\n\nThis is a platform game, where the objective is to collect scattered chips, and reach the destination, as a means to crack open a prisoner's lock. It's meant to be a skill-based platformer by avoiding hazards, although the camera movement is a bit substandard. \n\nThursday: **Battlestar Galactica**.  Hidden role board game. \n\nThis board game requires 4-6 players, cooperating together in order to have Galactica escape from the cylons, and reach Kobol. Each turn, there are crises that have to be handled by the players, to avoid bad events wearing down the ships by appling skills appropriate to the situation. However, one or two of the players are actually playing as cylons, who want to sabotage the battlestar and destroy it. \n\nIt is a long game, taking around 4 hours, due to the thinking involved in determining which card to play, although the game loop is much simpler than it is. The setup is more intimidating, although the game flow becomes easy only after a few steps.  The hidden traitors in this game seem rather powerful, especially if they're able to disable one of the human characters, especially if they're starting with the important roles of president or admiral. \n\nFriday: **[Night Lights: After Dark](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/637524)**.  Puzzle platformer, 15 levels.\n\nThis is a sequel to another puzzle game, where the gameplay involves the use of lights in order to make objects (box, floor or spikes) invisible. These may either be overhead lights or a portable lantern. The sequel adds a follower, which is attracted to nearby lights, and is therefore used to help stand on locations or push boxes around.",

Hence, why I usually stick to the Arcade and campaign mode. whilst also looking for any replayability options.\n\n**What I liked**\n\n* The World Tour is surprisingly decent.\n   * Two main maps, with certain areas being condensed (ex. a parking structure taken over by a gang).\n* Lots of Final Fight references in Metro City, and some callbacks to other fighters not in the game.\n   * There are also fighters from past games, like &gt;!Carlos Miyamoto and Retsu!&lt;.\n* World Tour is the only mode where you can actually directly interact with every main fighter, getting to see their personality and having them text you to hilarious effect.\n   * I hope there's an update where we can change the main fighters' outfits.\n* World Tour has a lot of character, with the setting design, the density of its \"open world\", and the enemies you fight (like a refrigerator).\n* The most jampacked content than any other SF game.\n* World Tour is incredibly innovative for fighting games.\n   * If Mortal Kombat vs DC began the trend of fighting games having a cinematic story, then SF6's World Tour might start a \"open world\" trend. Just hope it follows SF6's design and not every Ubisoft game lmao.\n\n**What I disliked (+nitpicks)**\n\n* World Tour ends up bring a grindfest as you have to level up each of your master's styles to unlock all of their moves.\n   * One of the side-missions involve fighting mini-bosses, each with an increasing level requirement. When I beaten the campaign, I was level 51. The highest level I've seen a mini-boss was 80.\n   * Most mob enemies I've seen around the game are around level 50-55.\n   * I wish there is a New Game+.\n* Why are there consumable debuffs?\n   * I know some of them are required to complete specific tasks (Be debuffed and win a fight to get an item), but those can be cheesed near the end of a match, so it is virtually useless.\n* Story is still kinda bad(ish).\n   * While it's a small step up from finding the macguffins in SFV, there isn't a whole lot in the way for this game. The comics continue to be the forefront for telling the narrative much, much better.\n* Outside of the World Tour, the only other single-player content is Arcade's story mode for each fighter.\n   * I suspect the game will get new gamemodes in the future, like Survival.\n* World Tour's optimization kinda sucks, as it would stutter (even though the frame rate counter doesn't even change numbers) when a fight would begin or I am entering a slightly dense area.\n   * My gaming laptop is a 3080 with 8GB, with the game's settings on High.\n   * It was also like this on the Steam Deck, despite Low settings.\n* Premium Currency.\n* Drive Tickets rate (the freemium currency).\n   * It's 4000 Drive Tickets/400 Premium Currency ($5) for pants. Yeesh.\n   * There is a daily challenge at the time of this writing where we can get 500 Drive Tickets.\n* No information on the Battle Pass.\n   * Unlike Diablo IV having a blog post telling us when their BP is coming OR ExoPrimal having a segment dedicated to its BP, the lack of info for SF6's BP is weird.\n* Just the BP and Premium Currency in general.\n   * Bound to happen since Re:Verse and ExoPrimal have it.\n   * Gonna suck if the next Monster Hunter game gets those.",

Nobody says \"fuck\" despite plenty of characters saying \"shit\". Why? Because they have no concept of reproduction. Nobody in this world fucks, or at least it's not a basic concept for them. So instead their curse words around sex and death are heavily linked with the flame clocks.\n\nFor me I kind of liked that, because it often feels like shows and games just introduce fake curse words to get around censors, but Xenoblade Chronicles 3 seems to have put a little thought into the language of its characters. It's like if you've ever seen a sci-fi character go \"What on Earth is that?\" despite being an alien from Proxima Centauri or something. Like that phrase just wouldn't exist for them, but we let it go because it's easier to parse.\n\nI know this is way too much thought for one minor point about the cursing in XC3, but I thought it was neat so I wanted to give it some context and shout out the writers for adapting in a way consistent with their own world. Cohesion like that elevates good worldbuilding to great worldbuilding for me.",

            "comment": "**What Remains of Edith Finch**\n\nBefore I went into this game, the only things I'd really heard were that it was your stock standard walking simulator, perfect for noobs who love to watch paint grow and grass dry. Then recently, I came across some really unique interesting gameplay on YouTube, and I realised this was clearly not a boring game.\n\nIt is true that most of what you do in this game is look and walk. But the narrative you reveal in your exploration is told phenomenally. &gt;!You play as the last surviving person in the Finch family, and you visit the old family home to find about about the other Finchs' who lived before (and during). The game is paced such that you learn the story of each of the dozen or so people who lived in the house one by one since everyone's room is preserved to be exactly how it was up until their death. Each person's death in so unique and fascinating,!&lt; and above all, each story is told in a truly creative way. I always wanted to get to the next person's story since it is so well written, and the story sequences are so creative in writing and in interaction.\n\nThe game is largely about loss, and it uses a lot of dark humour to deal with this. It keep the tone light enough to keep the game from being a depressing slog, but knows when to tighten up and be more serious when the narrative needs it. A lot of the stories and the history of the family is left to interpretation. I think this is such a smart move since loss can be super personal for so many people, and I can imagine that the open nature of the game's themes would allow people to impose their own thoughts and experiences on the both the larger narrative, and the individual personal stories told throughout the game. It is really the individual stories which make the game pop. &gt;!My favourites were Molly's story (the turning into various creatures), and Lewis' salmon cannery story. Dark yet \nbeautiful.!&lt;\n\nThe visual design leads itself so well to the the game's narrative objectives as well. &gt;!Beyond loss, the game is also about letting go of the past, and what horrors come about when one allows the past to dictate their future. The house in the game is ugly and abhorrent in design, with standard old foundations from when the family founded their home, to newer rooms affixed to the top of the house as if they had been hastily stapled on in order to make way for the new while leaving the old perfectly untouched. The newer rooms hang off at odd angles, with access only via walkways made of planks nailed together. The whole place looks like it should have collapsed years ago, and as you progress through the house, the foundations become more and more chaotic as you visit the rooms of younger Finchs', allowing this visual element to leak into the exploration. And so the very sentiment the game is criticising, the inability to let go of the past, is so wonderfully stated without words in the visuals.!&lt;\n\nI loved this game, and it does so much with so little in the way of interactivity. Not a second of the game is wasted time, as the focus of the pacing is paramount to how the story is told. It's brilliant just for the creativity in storytelling sequences. It did feel a bit short though, even if it was mostly dense. Interactivity, while used well in story sequences, was extremely limited in exploration. This is the only thing that feels missing in the game; I wish there was just a little more to do and see in the in-between.",

Great little title that satisfied my inner indie hunger. \n\nI continue to play **Cyberpunk 2077**.

Opinion didn't change, game is fantastic! Maybe annoyed by \"looting everything then checking 30 same weapons but oh this one has better rarity than previous one!\". Makes game feel more like ala-Borderlands looter than Action-Adventure RPG. But it's for muh immersion sooo...whatever. Oh and I absolutely HATE driving. Normal asphalt already weird feel but in Badlands it was paaaaain, like a freaking ice rink. And it felt like no matter what type of a car I picked.

            "comment": "I took an ill-fated chance on **Diablo 4** this weekend, and boy is it a mixed bag. The visual style is great, but that's just about where it ends. The writing, sound design (broadly), and even animations are mediocre at best, the actual gameplay loop is aggressively slow without having the satisfaction of a traditionally slower-paced game (like **Diablo 2**), and the world itself - while nice to look at - feels very *meh* as well.\n\nIt feels like a game that's failed to take note of any gameplay innovations happening over the past 20 years. Since the announcement, I had been cautiously optimistic about it not replicating the over-the-top action and screen-filling effects of **Diablo 3**, but what it actually is is a horrible in-between of the second and third game that manages, somehow, to reach neither in thei respective qualities. \n\nThe setup and premise of the story/world (largely interchangable in Diablo generally) is interesting; Lilith is a neat villain; and the darker vibe compared to its predecessor is welcome - but it doesn't deliver. It feels like a stripped-down version of **Diablo 3** with a fresh coat of paint. A welcome change, but hardly worth the price of admission...\n\nThere seems to be an almost endless array of critique you *could* level at the game in terms of the broader world of video games, but maybe it hits just the right spot for hardcore ARPG fans, and who am I to judge. As a casual fan of Diablo as a series, though, it's pretty much nothing more than the final confirmation that Blizzard in general has become an insular, myopic entity that can't actually make good video games, but might still manage to appease whatever niche it's trying to serve. \n\nHopefully, it at least *does* satisfy that niche, because I don't see much worth in this dreary and dull return to hell, but oh well. \n\n(The very prominent \"Shop\"-submenu brimming with cosmetic goodies doesn't help to dispel the feeling that this is all an advanced ploy to \"modernise\" the franchise in financial terms only.)",

            "comment": "I've been pretty much sucked into **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** since it's release. There are actually a lot of complaints that I can levy for this game, most of which you've probably heard already, but what the game does right more than balances out those complaints for me personally and it still is one of my favorite games of all time despite some frankly bizarre design choices.\n\nThe most glaring issue with the game for me is the dungeon ability implementation. It's funny too because it's a problem the series has literally already solved in the past. In TotK you have to press the A button specifically while positioned a certain way to use the ability, meaning it's easy to accidentally trigger it when trying to use the A button for other uses (particularly picking up items), and then other times when you *want* to use it you aren't able to because you can't get into position. I don't know why it couldn't work like previous zelda games and just have you swap out which ability is active at a time like equipping items. On top of that, the fuse ability, while cool imo, can get annoying particularly when using the bow because you have to call up the menu and pick your item for every single individual arrow. I feel like it would make more sense to continuously use that item fused until you equip a different fuse item. The voice acting is pretty bad altogether too, enough to take away from some moments in the story. Speaking of the story, it's... there. It's not really anything crazy but it does at least have a few big moments that will stick with me because they were cool. Now that I have explored all of the world I'm a little let down by the lack of new environments, and I don't mean the volume of space added, because there is alltogether more than double the explorable space than BotW had. What I mean by that is of the actual new spaces, there's the sky, which is very sparse with most of the islands being pretty similar, and the depths, which is massive but has one tileset for the entire area. I think having different biomes within the depths like how the main map is would have improved the game but realistically that is like another 2 years of dev time so I understand the logic behind it.\n\nDespite these issues, it is still one of my favorite games of all time. I personally place very high value in exploration in games because that is when I am enjoying myself the most so BotW and TotK are basically tailor made for me. The sense of freeform exploration just moving from one point of interest to the next thing that catches my eye is a very relaxing and engaging experience for me. I also like that of the 3 main areas (skies, surface, depths) all play very differently from each other. Each sky island or archipelago is like it's own self contained puzzle or encounter, with less focus on exploring and more focus on getting to a specific goal. The surface is classic BotW \"what's that over there??\" exploration. The depths present a whole different type of exploration because you *can't* ask what's that over there, you just have to strike out and find out yourself. The wild elevation changes make finding and traversing to the lightroots in the depths a very unique experience from the rest of the game that I was still drawn in by. One of my biggest complaints in BotW was that there was basically 2 rewards in the whole game; shrines and koroks. After like 10 hours you basically know what is at the end of every thread you pull on. This is not so in TotK. There are way more things to do besides shrines and koroks. There are more collectibles like bubbul gems, more and better sidequests, cosmetics to collect, and most importantly: Hudson Construction signs to erect (idk why but something about Addison makes me want to drop everything and help him whenever I see him).\n\nTears also has one of my favorite sanboxes to play in. I honestly don't usually get into sandbox style games; in BotW I never really pushed the abilities beyond their obvious uses. In TotK though I am in love with the building. The Zonai devices are robust enough that you can build some really wild stuff and I've found I am enjoying combat so much more when I just say fuck it and expend an unreasonable amount of resources to build a death machine that overkills every enemy I come against. I spent a good 3 hours yesterday just driving around hyrule field playing Nuts &amp; Bolts, slowly optimizing my mobile assault tank and mowing down patrols of bokoblins. I also have found myself \"breaking\" the game more often than in BotW. I mostly used the intended solution in the previous game but there have been an uncountable number of times where I have accomplished something in TotK and immediately said to myself \"there's no way that is how they wanted me to do that\". For me that feeling is very gratifying.\n\nI currently have beaten the main quests, filled out the compendium, completed all 152 shrines, and lit all light roots. I am still working on collecting all of the armor, exploring all the caves and wells, defeating all the world bosses, supporting all the addison signs, and completing all the side quests. Once I do that, if I still feel like playing, I will go for the full 100% and get the 1000 koroks (or maybe I'll just slowly chip away at that when I feel like playing over the next like 10 years)\n\nI finally took a break from Zelda last night to just do the tutorial for **Street Fighter 6**. I have never been able to get into traditional fighting games in the past but the insane critical praise this game has recieved plus the fact that I've been on a Capcom kick with all of their recent success convinced me to pick this up and give it a shot. I'll follow up next week to give my first impressions on it but I'm excited to try out what some are calling the best game in it's entire genre.",

With Rocksmith though, i've seen my skill improved a lot and its actually fun to play and learn. Its actually been a year since i first learned guitar with Rocksmith.  I find it easier learning with electric guitar, instead of acoustic. And its pretty pricey, i've bought a lot of guitar accessories even though i'm still pretty much a beginner.\n\nAfter learning the basic with Rocksmith, i taught myself on reading guitar tab so im not relying on only licensed music from Rocksmith. With my only learning tool being Rocksmith, i'm sure i've developed a bad habit/form without an actual teacher, but so far, i'm having a lot of fun learning some song I've been dying to play along, but i realized that my body coordination sucks so bad, that i can't sing while playing lol. I can see myself still playing for more years to come.\n\nNot interested in Rocksmith plus though. I've had it with subscription services.\n\nFor **Honkai Star Rail,** i didn't expect to get sucked in too deep with this gacha. Its not even on my radar before, as having Genshin alone already took my of my gaming time. Im aware of it, but im not in the mood for turn based game, and at first, I thought it look basic, and im more drawn toward Zenless Zone Zero as i dig its artstyle and presentation more.\n\nSince i'm kinda fed up with the way Genshin told its story atm, i tried Star Rail, and for now, i prefer it a lot more than Genshin. From the get go, the main highlight is how the story and writing is a lot more intriguing, and the characters are much more interesting to know more about. While the gameplay a bit basic at first, facing some bosses with their own unique moveset add more interesting strategy to the gameplay. Simulated World is definitely another highlight for me though, as an enjoyer of Roguelike, very fun, and hoping for more blessings/curios to be added in next version/content.\n\nOverall, definitely enjoyable, felt more competent than Genshin (like i finally can seamlessly switch from keyboard to controller, like why the fuck such basic ass function arent implemented in Genshin), and i might be wrong with this but so far i havent seen story line being locked off because 'character/place is busy being used on another quest' bullshit.\n\nBoth those game kinda prevent me from touching gamepass for a month, but today i've been playing **Chorvs**. Its enjoyable so far, didnt expect it to be open world, but im fine with it. Story is pretty intriguing, so i'm going to play more of it hopefully can finish it as well before it leaves gamepass.",

            "comment": "**The Messenger**\n\nMy earliest memories around video games were attributed to the 90\u2019s era of consoles, however I don\u2019t have a strong attachment to those games. I remember playing classics like Super Mario Bros., Super Mario World, and the original Sonic the Hedgehog, but my time with those was spotty at best. It wasn\u2019t until I got my Gameboy Color with Pokemon Blue that I really started developing my first memories around games. From there, video games quickly jumped to 3D models on the N64, and the rest of my retro gaming days were history.\r  \n\r  \nTherefore, I think 8 and 16-bit classics aren\u2019t really my style or something I have a lot of nostalgia for. I\u2019ve still played and loved games that have those classic pixel graphics, but they don\u2019t exactly bring back or create feelings like I\u2019m playing an \u201cold school\u201d game.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, something about The Messenger felt different.\r  \n\r  \nThe game\u2019s 8-bit graphics and music were an immediate tone setter, but not only that, the overall presentation of its opening cutscenes, menus, UI, and sound effects all contributed to this atmosphere of a game that traveled through time from over 30 years ago. It somehow made me feel nostalgic for an experience that I never had.\r  \n\r  \nAt the surface, it looks like a game emulating that retro 2D platformer style from the NES era. And when I started it, that\u2019s basically what I got. It wasn\u2019t bad by any means, and the controls were very tight with a great mechanic that allowed the player to jump after striking an object or enemy, but it was a very straightforward game. However, as I progressed further through it, it felt more like a historic tour through multiple classic gaming experiences that I never had.\r  \n\r  \nThe twist of being able to travel to the future with a 16-bit aesthetic was very cool, although not as mind blowing as I thought the twist should\u2019ve been. However, that\u2019s because the real twist was when I defeated the very difficult Demon General, and the game transformed into a Metroidvania/collect-a-thon.\r  \n\r  \nIn many ways it reminded me a lot of **Tunic** and how that game also transformed into a totally different beast after overcoming a difficult combat challenge. And like Tunic, just when I thought the game might have been winding down, it blasted the doors open to far more content than I originally anticipated.\r  \n\r  \nThe game then somehow kept going and going and continued to ramp up in fun factor to amazing set pieces and bosses, especially towards the end. In the penultimate level, the game briefly transformed again into a side scroller shooter while riding a dragon shooting fireballs to take down an army of steampunk robots. And *then* as I collected the last Power Seal, I unlocked one of the coolest weapons ever with the Windmill Shuriken. And ***then*** when I thought the game couldn\u2019t get any cooler it dropped the wildest lore dump backed by the sickest soundtrack to prepare me for the final level.\r  \n\r  \nTo top it all off, this game was legitimately hilarious throughout the entire story. I loved the dialogue between the shopkeeper and the protagonist and all the silly interactions with the other characters. I especially loved how the protagonist seems like some random dude who just kind of showed up and was told to be the hero of this journey. Strange events kept happening around this dude, and it felt like his only response was \u201csweet\u201d or \u201cno way!\u201d, and he just continued going along with everything.\r  \n\r  \nThis game was an absolute blast from the past, with an incredibly fun adventure through a retro age of gaming. Although it\u2019s presented like an \u201cold school\u201d game, it felt super tight with its controls, so I never thought I was being held back in any way and only the best was brought forward. The Messenger successfully completed its mission; traveling through multiple eras it was able to deliver the perfect \u201cold school\u201d experience to the modern day.\n\n[If you liked reading that, come check out my blog for all my video game write ups!](https://galexzzz.wordpress.com/2023/06/03/the-messenger/)",

            "comment": "**Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword**\n\nI really want to be able to recommend this game but it's kind of a mixed bag. Which is really a shame because most of the content really sticks out as something memorable in a positive way.\n\nThe characters are fun, the music is great, and I love the art style. Things like how the time door (I forget what it's called) are designed just really sticks out as a fun and memorable design. I also like how it works as a bit of an origin story for the series.\n\nA lot of the level design is also really amazing. The Ancient Cistern and the the pirate ship are some of the most memorable levels from anything I've played all year. The timestone mechanic and the concept of the cistern are just really creative and memorable. Just a lot of really well designed puzzles and the boss fights are pretty much all consistently really fun. \n\nThe problem is the last third of the game just feels like everyone got insecure about the runtime. You don't really do anything new or fun mechanically (I mean collecting tadtones is new but if you tell me that's fun you're insane) and the game is so obviously dragging its feet before you actually get back to any of the interesting stuff at the end and it throws the pacing really out of whack to where I'm not sure I'll ever touch it again. Also the motion controls are somewhat not functional on Switch. I quit trying to use them because the Switch could never tell when I was trying to do a thrust attack.\n\nBut the finale was super cool so that sort of made up for some of my complaints. It's a solid game but the last third makes it a little hard for me to say it's really good instead of just somewhere along the lines of solid-pretty decent.\n\n**Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**\n\nAs someone who wasn't huge on Breath of the Wild this game feels like everything BotW was supposed to be. The new mechanics actually really encourage me getting creative to deal with combat challenges and exploration. The items that enemies drop are also for more valuable due to the fuse mechanic. The new abilities have so many potential uses I feel like I'll never even crack the surface of what I can actually achieve with these.\n\nThe puzzles are way more fun also with these abilities. I really look forward to every shrine and I feel like an absolute genius every single time I solve a puzzle. Abilities like Ultrahand and the rewind one also just make exploration such a blast. Trying to create paths to sky islands is just so damn fun.\n\nAlso I'm actually finding some cool unique things that I don't expect to be in other Hyrule areas which is something I thought BotW was sorely lacking. Also I'm already noticing a lot of enemy variety so far which is also really keeping up my enthusiasm for exploring.\n\nI'm not very far in (just trying to unlock as many skyview towers as I can before I start on the missions) but I really do think this will easily be my favorite Zelda game. Nintendo have really knocked it out of the park here.",

It\u2019s been over a decade since I\u2019ve touched the second Katamari, so I hardly remember it. All the varied challenges, the absurd writing, layout of its levels; this game reeks of style, and no game will ever be quite like it. I thought my partner would get a kick out of it, but she thought it was a bit sensory overload, which is more than fair. It\u2019s also very good at triggering the \u201cone more run\u201d syndrome, so I definitely missed some sleep last night.\n\nI\u2019ve heard criticism about bad FPS on the Switch, which was a fear of mine when I bought it. I figured the trade off for portability was worth it, and yeah, it kind of is. It definitely staggers in certain areas, only once in a few hours did it get impacted heavily by it (to the point I had a few seconds of trouble playing), but otherwise it\u2019s negligible. If I played my PC more often, I would have more than likely bought it on there.\n\n**Zelda: TOTK**\n\nGameplay is nearly perfect, I won\u2019t get into that. I do want to say that a lot of the cutscenes are tediously difficult to get through. I want some context for what I\u2019m doing, otherwise I would skip them. There was really just one pivotal moment that\u2019s gotten me good so far, &gt;!the light dragon memory.!&lt; \n\nThat\u2019s a slight blemish on an otherwise incredibly polished product. My partner and I trade off while playing it, switching between puzzles or whenever we want a break. It\u2019s fun, and really cool how we both have our unique ways of finding solutions.\n\n**Lemon Cake**\n\nI\u2019ve watched my partner play this a lil bit. It\u2019s cute. Super cute. Like a chill form of Overcooked meets single player progression. Maybe that\u2019s not an apt way of describing it, but she loves doing a few runs to kill some time. The premise is you inherit a haunted cafe, and you slowly build it up while serving clientele some cute pastries to generate income. You make a menu of the day, which depending how you layout the variety of your menu, you earn additional tips fine tuning it. Honestly, it\u2019s pretty polished for what it is, and if you\u2019re looking for something to chill out to, similar to Stardew vibes, I\u2019d say check it out.",

Not a fan of the recipe RNG, but I'm having a good time otherwise.\n\nI also started **Last Remnant: Remastered**. Not usually a fan of SaGa and the other FF2 descendants, but I'm enjoying this! Difficulty feels... a bit inconsistent? One of the first sidequests felt really hard, but the first boss was a cakewalk. The second boss (BR4) took four tries; first attempt, I was a bit dumb about which union I targeted first. Second try, the boss immediately went for Rush's union and spammed its Pthlegethon. Third attempt, it used its AoE on its first or second turn, and I wiped shortly after. Fourth attempt went swimmingly. Kept my Morale gauge in the blue the whole time, and the boss didn't use its AoE. The music that kicks in when your morale is high is really hype! Love, love, love the enemy designs and weapons system. The little digger guy is a cute way to harvest field mats.\n\n\n\nI gave **KoTOR 1** a second chance and started **KoTOR 2**. The first time I played KoTOR, I didn't know what I was doing, found it too hard, and gave up. This time? I actually enjoyed it and ended up finishing it! Went for Soldier/Guardian and LS ending with Bastila romance. Aside from the Star Forge's infinite enemy nonsense, most of the game was smooth sailing. The Sith Academy was neat, though I was bummed I couldn't save the Mandalorian prisoner (but I guess that's something for a replay). I do wish the AI was better (something like the gambit system would have been nice). I'm playing the sequel with TSLRCM and having a blast! Went with Consular this time, and I think I made the right call. It's great having the force so early. Love having T3 back! He is so precious. The whole starting sequence (from waking up to getting the Ebon Hawk back on Telos) was way better than Taris. Helped out the ithorians and decimated the Exchange, much to Kreia's chagrin. I already know &gt;!she's Darth Traya. I ain't giving her anything she wants if it means being a selfish prick.!&lt; I'll be really happy once I finish repairing HK-47.

I did a mine cart sequence just now that, while nothing super blood pumping or of notable scale, managed to impress just because of how it arose from the existing systems I'd been using for the last 80 hours.  Rather than some RE4 style set piece where I walk up and press a prompt to enter the mine cart which then starts to move of its own volition, its a totally imersive series of choices that end with me zipping around lava caverns and sending exploding rocks back at their spewer.  Like it was a lava cavern and I didnt feel like buying the heat suit and I had no potions.  What to do?  Well the heat suit is needed cus otherwise you catch on fire, right?  Well ive been collecting zonai fire hydrants from dispensers all game so just slap that bad boy on the minecart point at yourself and you are all set.  Like how is this a better immersive sim than the last two arkane games??  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really wonder how a kid growing up with this game will react to going back to ocarina of time or even my beloved Wind Waker.  Obviously I think both still hold tremendous cultural value, but from a pop culture view point, have we passed a thresh hold in the verisimilitude of gaming?  We think of those games being closer to tears of the kingdom than the original zelda game, but at a certain point aesthetic differences like pixel art vs polygons may feel superfluous.  Like I got into the series with Wind Waker and already it felt like I was arriving late to a legendary canon.  Windwaker came out closer to the original Zeldas release than it did Tears of the Kingdom.  Video games are getting old, and oh so good.",

            "comment": "**Titanfall 2**\n\nI've only played the campaign, didn't touch the Multiplayer, but it was pretty good.\n\nThe gameplay is great and feels great. I played Apex Legends for a bit before this game, so it was weird seeing all these same or similar things, like weapons or objects in the world.\n\nThe campaign started out alright, kinda generic, except for all that double jumping and wall running, but picked up in the second half. It\u2019s still pretty short, it took me about 6 hours to beat it on hard difficulty. The levels sometimes end a bit weird, it just fades to black, when you might not really expect it. The connection between them can also at times feel somewhat haphazardly, as if the devs just threw together some half-random locations, which is something that I\u2019m not used to anymore in modern shooter campaigns.\n\nSince this game regularly goes on sale for like 5\u20ac, I'd definitely recommend it, even for someone who isn't interested in the Multiplayer.\n\n**Prodeus**\n\nI got the game back when it was in early access and finished a few levels, but wasn't in a mood for retro shooters back then, so I shelved it. Now that I am, I've revisited it, and like it.\n\nAt first, I was kinda disappointed in the weapons, because they felt either weak or just chew through ammo, so you're empty in a few seconds. It's definitely gotten much better since then though. The game has a lot of weapons, and all of them I guess have some kind of alternate fire to slightly change it. Like the pistol shoots once normally, but when you ADS you do a short burst. The shotgun gets charged while aiming and also does some fire damage, or the plasma rifle locks onto an enemy or a surface, and your shots get some slight homing properties (although that feels pretty much useless in a fight).\n\nYou're incentivized to explore the levels, because you can find ore fragments, a currency that you can use to buy / unlock stuff in a shop. So far I've unlocked a quad shotgun, the aforementioned plasma rifle, a double jump and a dash.\n\nThe game has an overworld a-la Mario 3, where you walk between levels, although it's been pretty linear at first, only now opening up a tiny bit with some branching paths. You can also re-play old levels and get the missing secrets if you want.\n\nWhile the overall gameplay feels good, the highlight for me is definitely the visuals. I love the way the game looks. It's a 3D environment, enemies are sprites (I think you can change them to 3D models in the options), with a slightly pixelated look. There's a bunch of effects going on at times, enemies explode into tons of blood (which can make it hard to see, if you're killing something up close), and I'm just really into the whole package.\n\nSo far I've been playing on Very Hard difficulty, which is the second highest, and so far it's not too bad. I think I've died to enemies once, the other times were when I fell down pits. There are like seven different difficulty settings, but according to the internet, it just changes the enemy health and damage. On Very Hard the enemies have 110% HP and deal 200% damage (compared to Normal) and you really feel that. Even just a few mistakes can leave you on the brink of death, and there aren't health packs everywhere like in Boltgun. When I re-played some levels, I've turned it down to Ultra Easy, where enemies have 45% HP and deal 33% damage, and the difference is enormous. If you just want a mindless shooter and run through the levels, I'd recommend sticking to the lower difficulties. Right now, I'm playing pretty slow and more defensively.\n\n**The Division 2**\n\nMy friend and I finished the normal campaign, I guess, and moved to the higher \"difficulties.\"\n\nAfter you're done with the normal missions and cleared the Strongholds (like a dungeon I guess) once, you're moved up to something call World Tier 1. The map resets to some extent, and now a new enemy faction has invaded some missions and the Strongholds. Every time you clear a Stronghold again you move up a World Tier, right now we're on Tier 4, and Tier 5 seems to be highest.\n\nFor now, we'll focus on getting to that last World Tier and then we'll see. We still have the expansion content to go through, so there's stuff to do and we're having fun.",

Zombie shooters are fine to me but this game, traveling in the dark metro tunnels alone was pretty unnerving. With the occasional jumpscares.     \n\nPlaying on survival mode but normal difficulty, ammo and resources quite limited. So.. I tried to take headshots on monsters or let NPC soak up damage for me.  Despite the game being abit dated now, the dark atmosphere and the characters makes for an immersive experience.   \n\nRight now I am starting the Metro last light title next.  \n\nSleeping Dogs,\n\nI been thinking of replaying GTA titles in awhile now and had this in my steam library for quite awhile. The melee combat is similar to batman arkham titles and missions  &amp; driving like the open world of GTA. You spend more battles with your fist than gunplay though.  \n\nPlaying the game reminds me of Hongkong action flims about being an undercover cop. After playing this, I kinda want to continue with Yakuza title next.  \n\nThe game is frequently on discount and is well worth the cost.",

The Redux versions are mostly just tweaked to play a little more modern, mostly adding a lot of QoL changes from LL to 2033. Also if you like both games I would highly *highly* recommend Exodus as well. It plays a bit different with the more open areas on the surface but still had plenty of linear dark corridor areas to make it feel like a real Metro game.",

            "comment": "Been really into my fighting games as of late, been binging some of the old collection games on Steam. Mainly to prepare for **Street Fighter 6** which is finally out. It's weird because even though I thought I would be playing mainly online to start, I've been stuck in the World Tour mode. Partly because I wanna unlock the second costumes for characters, but also because outside of maybe the first chapter or two it's been surprisingly engaging. The progression feels pretty good overall (minus upgrading your equipment which costs a ton of money to do for whatever reason for such minimal gains), the customisation you have over your fighter's playstyle keeps the mode engaging as you try out new styles/moves, and the cutscenes are pretty well done. Overall, it's a decent timesink and I can imagine this being quite enjoyable for people who are new to fighting games as well, as it doesn't overwhelm you and secretly teaches you how to play the game while still being fun.\n\nAs for online, I've still to land on a specific character that I wanna main. While they all have their own playstyles and unique moves, none of them I would say feel truly distinct - at least not in comparison to most other fighting games. A good chunk of the roster also includes charge inputs which I find to be bleh, outside of Blanka I just don't merge well with it, especially as I'm playing on a keyboard which makes down/up inputs a bit tricky. At the moment I think I'm sticking with Manon and Zangief for ranked, and then trying out the rest of the roster in casuals whenever I feel like it. Regardless, my experience has been super smooth so far. Managed to play a relatively lag-free match against someone with 200+ ping from South Africa which I found quite astonishing. The netcode is stellar and is much appreciated.\n\nBefore SF6 though, I did play a couple of the fighting game collections as I said. First, I went to the obvious **Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection**. I never really played much SF to be honest, mainly just a bit of Third Strike on PS3 a while ago. I tried to enjoy SF2, but no matter what version I play it just never feels that great. Maybe if I was playing 2-player mode (I sadly had to play vs CPU for all games as I have nobody willing to play) it'd be more fun, and I can appreciate the game's legacy of course which set the foundation for future fighting games.\n\nAlpha 3 was really fun though. Dunno how I feel about the different super options you can select, especially the last one which makes you warp around like mad, but the characters feel more developed and enjoyable to play. It even made me enjoy Blanka, dude gets a move that let's him shake watermelons from the sky lol.\n\nI also beat all three version of Street Fighter 3, which meant beating the notorious Gill three times. Third Strike of course is just a fantastic game even to this day, but I did enjoy the other two version for what they were. While the balance was completely off and certain mechanics were missing/needed refining, the basis was always there which includes the lovely character sprite art. Music was also really good, perhaps on par with Third Strike in my opinion.\n\nAnd the other fighting game collection I played was the **Capcom Fighting Collection**, mainly because I had never played any Darkstalkers before. And I am glad I picked this up because I think they're fantastic games. Even the first one felt pretty nice, although the fact that you're forced to use your super at 100% or lose it is pretty bad. The second game introduced the character I played the most and had a lot of fun playing as (Lei-Lei, or Hsien-Ko in the English version), and the third one not only refined everything to a great degree but also added even more insane characters. I think if I were to play 2-player in any of the fighting games I mentioned, it'd be Darkstalkers for sure. I love how distinct the characters are in both gameplay and visuals - no two characters seem to play the same, including unique movement options as well.",

            "comment": "**[wizorb:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/207420/)** when in doubt, play breakout (again). nice pixel graphics here, but just like last week's *shatter*, saving is fucky, though better than in that one. it saves when you quit, so can continue from where you left next time, but can only go back to town after every 12th level and the boss or lose the current world's progress. fucked up non-rebindable controls too ('j' to confirm, 'k' for back, etc.) and no music in the menu to set volumes properly, then you're deaf after starting a new game and no settings while playing. oh, and half the blocks are unbreakable, leading to tedious levels. only posted a [brief negative review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/207420/) this time, game's too average to bother with more, but surprisingly I could complete it on easy.\n\n**[glass masquerade 3:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1536980/)** fucking finally! 30 levels but I'm sure more will follow. you can cut pictures up into hexagons now as well, the best shape, but I didn't expect them seeping into all 3 cut options, what's the fucking point then? the new game modes are really restrictive (work inwords or upwards with a limited set of pieces, then get more when you're done), but classic got patched in quickly. rotation was fuckier than ever as well, now it's better and there's finally a brightness setting. [my review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1536980) with a bit more info.\n\n**[violet bricks:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430770/)** look, another breakout. just came out, not too pricey but I can't recommend it. very amateurish, ugly menus, only mouse controls, including bringing up the pause menu, but that also moves the paddle. a single volume setting that only affects the music, not the effects. 24 levels unlocked one by one otherwise, power-ups/downs, the usual. the dev might fix it up, then it might become recommendable even if nothing special.\n\n**[ylands:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/298610/)** one of the billion crafting/survival things, been meaning to play one again for a while. supposedly 'free', so I would never touch it, but it used to have a dlc on the store page that was the actual game, adventure mode or whatever, which I picked up from a bundle. now it's only avaiable as an in-app purchase, or to quote the developer, *'All of the DLC content can be obtained for free if you grind for it :)'* (yes, they even added an insulting smiley).\n\nstill, might as well try it if I already have it, instead of playing something I'm more interested in. shit mood does that and it's been getting worse and worse lately, but at least I take out some of the trash. this particular piece **cannot be paused even in single player**, an instant dealbreaker. hunger, temperature, real-time cooking, inventory drop on death, all the shit I don't want, and can't even take a literal shit myself irl without my character starving to death (depending on how long the shit takes). and not even a decent hunger or heat indicator with actual values so I know what to eat to avoid wasting better food.\n\nI fucked around for a bit still, even though the game told me without enough ram it'll just crash. it didn't, turning off/down everything made it mostly playable with a 90s pixely aesthetic, don't care about graphics anyway. initial loading took a while, no problem, then a new island took really long as well, and I had to sail reeeeealllly slowly for a long time until I actually hit the island becuase spawn is nowhere near, out in the middle of the fucking ocean.\n\nthen I got killed by a badger (first time for everything) and respawn took as fucking long as loading the island the first time. not sure what I dropped, most of my stuff was actually still on me. might be because of first death or story island or whatever, didn't check, just wanted to quit, which is done by leaving the game first, lots of loading only to go back to the menu with an actual exit button, followed by even more loading somehow. loading times in general are all on me and my shitty pc, but respawns and quitting the fucking game taking as long as loading an entire island is absolutely insane.\n\nno idea when/how the game saves, no manual option though, why would there be? for next time I booted my shitty laptop out of curiosity. no issues with loading (should be using it but I hate laptops and can't set it up properly, no room), but got greeted with 'your last yland isn't available right now, choose another one.' wtf? picked the same one, it loaded, map wiped along with the death marker. fuck off. died again deliberately, went back, nothing, so inventory drop must be bugged or something. one of the few positive things. oh yeah, can't even get workstations or beds back, only destroy them for some mats and make another one. spent a long time looking for flint to make a deconstruction hammer on top of the other one but it does the same. and this was where I stopped.\n\nI'm sure it being 'free' is ideal for kids, but people with any amount of standards or real-life responsibilities (and believe me, I don't have much of either) should just opt for other similar games that have basic functionality and no f2p fuckery. not that there are many of them, most of these are developed incredibly lazily, without any respect for the player's time or different playstyles or preferences.\n\n**[osiris: new dawn:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/402710/)** this I shouldn't have bought at all, even if it barely cost anything from a bundle. sci-fi setting, had 3rd-person view, was good enough at the time. just noticed it got pulled from steam, so while the laptop was still turned on, I gave it a shot. without a dedicated gpu it was struggling a lot even without all the shit I'd never turn on regardless of hardware (bloom, motion blur, shake, etc.), a weather toggle would've been nice too. lowered resolution to the minimum, that mostly did the trick.\n\nthere's challenge, creative and story, was only interested in the last one. didn't expect 4 classes to choose from, went with the ranger, the rest seemed more suited for multiplayer, and choose easy, not normal, of course. also didn't expect saving anytime, though it just overwrites the autosave, so practically useless.\n\ntook me a while to figure controls out (hold to craft, etc.), but managing oxygen and tool durability was too much of a pain (how is a basic rock more durable than some high-tech knife?), nights are completely dark (the flaslight isn't much help), scanning your surroundings for a basic map takes forever every fucking time the map is brought up (the minimap is mini), the game doesn't pause while menus like crafting are up, and I inevitably got raped by big fucking spider-like aliens on the first night, right at the original spawn location, didn't even wander far. so I gave up fast, didn't even wait for the morning (doubtful that enemies simply disappear when the 'sun' comes up), I like my survival games without survival elements, thank you. and better 3rd-person view, while we're at it.\n\n**[the adventures of tree:](https://store.steampowered.com/app/354860/)** tried the demo years ago (it's still available) and even though I had mixed feelings, I grabbed the game at some point. what a fool. there's a paid dlc coming but I'm a lot less about waiting for all the paid content before starting something these days, the base game will usually do, which still gets patches occasionally (it came out in 2015).\n\nit's a side-scrolling adventure/rpg/thing, some basic settings, multiple endings, voiced intro and tutorial. clunky non-rebindable controls, shit combat, inventory drop on death, no highlighting of interactable objects, no 'take all' from chests. there's at least fast travel via the map.\n\nhunger (2500 units, goes down by 3 every fucking second), stamina for sprinting (can't have you moving around at your own pace all the time, fucking hate this in every game, recharge isn't that fast either). typewriter effect for dialog with an annoying sound. there's a separate 'interface' volume slider but that includes other stuff too and pressing a key simply moves on to the next line instead of showing the current one instantly. and of course you can't just save anywhere anytime either, only shitty autosaves in certain places. oh, and the quest window bugged out, blurred the screen but didn't show any quest info, so I couldn't even finish the tutorial. quit, loaded the save, appeared at the same location (that's where the checkpoint was), with my previous quest removed (I got one at my house) and the tutorial deactivated, plus the quest window still didn't work. great job after 8 fucking years. so I wandered around a bit and called it. lazy trash.\n\n(fun fact: without meaning to I've been maintaining a ~60% completion rate on steam for years and **now I have 1000 'completed' games** of nearly 1600 (it was more than that but I've 'permanently' removed some stuff recently, unplayed games from blacklisted devs, etc.). some are digital backups of stuff I played as a kid, so never even got installed, others got ditched fast like some of the above (done as far as I'm concerned), there are multiple copies of a few as well (remasters, etc.), but most still got played to actual completion. I don't care about achievements or perfecting everything, especially these days, plus prefer shorter games and more variety within the sameness, hence the big library and all the games mentioned in these posts most weeks.)\n\n([last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13tvmns/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/jlxhoep/))",

            "comment": "**Assassin's Creed Valhalla**\n\nI finally finished the whole story, all DLC and both season pass expansions. Haven't played Dawn of Ragnarok and don't really have much interest in it at the moment. I wrote quite a lot about it in previous thread so I won't repeat any of those points here.\n\nI like most of the \"sagas\" in the game but the amount of them just completely ruins any semblance of pacing the game might have had. Half of them should've been made optional/side quests. I feel like that would improve the flow of the story and pacing dramatically, especially since majority of them do feel like elaborate side quests rather than \"main story\". \n\nStory spoilers (base game and DLC) - &gt;!I absolutely hated everything related to mythology and ISU story line in this game. The whole norse pantheon reincarnation thing is just stupid as hell and very poorly executed. The storyline where you go to norway with sigurd to find ISU machine was the absolute worst part of the game's story for me. I'm fine with them adding some mythological elements to their games if that's the direction they want to take (though I'd prefer if it was kept to DLC) but this was just too much. Having Basim in modern time is also just stupid, why can't these games just be some \"normal\" people reliving the memories of their ancestors instead of some stupid godlike beings that are thousand years old just chilling in the modern world. Siege of Paris' story was fantastic. I liked the Odyssey crossover DLC overall but I hate the fact that it just has Kassandra as Eagle-bearer instead of letting you pick whether you had Alexios or Kassandra. The last DLC where Basim views Eivor's future memories was terrible but it wraps up the story a bit better than the actual game does so whatever.!&lt;\n\nSiege of Paris' assassinations were some of the best in the series, similar to Unity and I really hope they keep that mission design in future games and expand on it. Resistance missions were pretty shit and rising your resistance level was very grindy so I gave up on it pretty quickly. It's a solid expansion with great story and main quest design and some shitty side content. Thankfully the map wasn't too big.\n\nThe game somehow feels high effort and low effort at the same time. Free DLC that could've been 2-3 quests set in one of the zones that were already in the game instead had an island with it's own zones and everything created just for it. There's a free rogue-lite mode that was added just for the sake of it. Even the final piece of DLC that was just a story wrap up had a special armor set created just for it (it's ugly as shit but still, it was made just for a short, free DLC). On the other hand, during certain cutscenes you pull weapons out of your ass because the weapon they animated for the cutscene is not the one you have equipped. The worst of all is just how half-assed being able to play either male or female Eivor is. I tried out both and settled on male because it fit the story/fantasy better and the male voice actor was fantastic. He was still referred to as Eivor Varinsdottir way too often. Even worse, &gt;!during certain cutscenes he magically transformed into the female Eivor with armor set that I didn't have equipped before magically reverting back to male in the same cutscene. Last Goodbyes' final cutscene has Basim sitting outside the cabin where he briefly sees a memory/vision of female Eivor despite the fact that I played male for 90% of the game. What the fuck is the point of letting me pick my character's gender if you're just going to change it at a whim? I really hope they just create an actual character in the next game and just let you make some dialogue choices for that specific character. Don't care if it's male or female, just pick one and go with that, the way TW3 and AC:Origins did because the way they did it in Odyssey, and especially Valhalla, is just garbage.!&lt;\n\nOverall, it's a pretty solid open world action RPG with a ton of content. I'm pretty satisfied with it, even though it's definitely the weakest of the new RPG trilogy.\n\n**Final Fantasy XIII**\n\nI was in a mood for a JRPG after beating Valhalla as my experience with the genre is very limited so this is one of the games I tried out before I decide what to play. I haven't played much but it's okay so far. Holds up pretty well graphically. I don't understand the combat system at all and it's extremely linear so far but we'll see how it goes.\n\n**Chained Echoes**\n\nAnother one of the options. Also played only a little bit but it's fantastic so far. I love the graphics style, combat is fun and pretty quick. The story seems pretty interesting.\n\n**Chrono Trigger**\n\nOption number 3. I really hope this gets a remaster. I like the story so far. The whole game feels very nostalgic even though I never played it. Combat is very quick and fun so far.\n\n**Tales of Arise**\n\nSteam demo just plops you into the world with very little context so I have no idea what's going on. Combat is pretty good, much better than my previous Tales of experiences (Berseria, Zestria and Vesperia). Looks great, character designs are pretty cool.",

It should, as you say, have been an optional DLC.   \n\nI think the game designers believe they need to harken back to the old school AC sometimes, which for me, a lifelong AC player (every game, several times), is no longer relevant.  I'm fine with them moving on.",

            "comment": "**Ghost Recon: Wildlands** (PS5)\n\n\nI was looking for a new game and stumbled upon this one. I've had my eye on it for quite some time but was a bit worried that it would be too Ubisofty for me. Well, I've played for a couple of hours so far. The game does have Ubisoft written all of over it, but I'm still enjoying it, it seems to be very well made.\n\n\nThe first impression is that it reminds me of The Mercenaries, which was one of my favorite games on the PS2. The highlight there was stealing a tank and wreaking havoc. I don't think there are tanks in Wildlands, but it seems to do a good job with the military open world setting.\n\n\nThe gunplay is solid and the world is beautifully realized. Silently leading a squad through the countryside under the stars reminded me of my own military service - there aren't many games that provoke that feeling. Most military-themed games are so full of themselves that they don't let you stand and look around for a minute. \n\n\nSo yeah, overall I'm pleased with this. Don't know if it will grab me for the entire ride but so far so good.",

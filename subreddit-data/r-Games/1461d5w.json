Which is not much but it's strange that it happened twice.\n\nDeadly Premonition did the same thing. Deadly Premonition 1 was heavily inspired (blatantly ripping off in the best way) twin peaks. Deadly premonition 2 on the other hand heavily borrowed from True Detective.",

Apparently xbox ran the best but i never played on that system. The story was bizarre and strange in all kinds of hilarious ways, the combat sucked ass and was just completely boring. And the soundtrack was so wholesome and uplifting. The game had a weird disconnect between trying to be a horror game and being a wholesome small town simulator.\n\nIt had a ton of cool systems that few devs have matched though. Cars had functioning wipers and lights for the rain, the car mirrors worked (which very few games add for some damn reason), and you had to keep your car gassed up and in good condition. People would comment if you were unshaved and your clothes were old and dirty, so you'd have to stay clean. And missions would only happen at certain times, as characters all had their own lives and schedules. So if the next story mission was at 8am the following morning, you'd have the rest of the day to go do side missions, explore, fish or just sleep until the next day.\n\nIt's described as the best worst game of all time, and it's one of my favorite games of all time. I recommend it to anyone who likes twin peaks. I would atleast check out some videos on it on YouTube, plenty of people check it out just to go on a bizzare adventure.",

The seasons have completely different casts and disconnected stories. It's a big reason why the quality feels it varies so much",

Though with this game seemingly focusing on at least two main characters (police/detective lady and wake), it should give more breathing room for the story to do things. Just gotta hope it doesn't also make gameplay a little disjointed as a result. Very interested in what seems to be slightly more of a push from 'creepy' to 'horror' at play here too.",

A few months after release the only people left playing where tryhards who would kill Jason 9/10 times.\n\nPart of this was due to an update that buffed survivors and nerfed Jason. They tried to make the game more balanced like dead by daylight. I've always been upset about that. The game was fun because it wasn't balanced fairly. I don't think the survivors should have a \"fair\" chance at killing Jason.",

Aliens *had* to swarm, but they could crawl through vents, hang from the ceiling, and hide in the shadows. The humans could run with a few and manage relatively well, while the predator really only needed one player to handle the other two if they were good. \n\nI miss that game.",

There'd be servers with 14 aliens, 8 marines, and 2 predators - which sounds insane, but it just worked perfectly.  The aliens were so weak before they ate someone, so most of the time you got chewed up as an alien, but sometimes you'd eat a human, morph, eat a few more, morph, and then you're a queen and just totally crushing face.  Humans had so many weapons and vision modes, it was hard to feel underpowered, their gear was top notch and they were shredding aliens.  \n\nThen there'd be the two guys playing predators and you'd hear this \\*schwing\\* and someone's head would come off due to that damn disc and you'd realize \"oh shit not aliens\" and swap vision mode - which gave aliens all the time in the world to jump you.",

The different versions of Jason do have different strengths and weaknesses but still play mostly the same since it's not a bunch of different killers like DBD.  The survivors can get perks but they mostly modify existing stats.  The survivors in Friday all have different stats so some have more stamina, others are good at repairing, some are super quiet making it harder for Jason to hear them, etc.\n\nThe actual gameplay is far different.  Survivors are trying to escape but you have different ways you can do this, including killing Jason which requires a specific process and teamwork to pull off.  Jason's goal is simply to kill as many survivors as possible.  The maps are far bigger so early on Jason will likely be setting traps, listening for loud sounds(which will show up visually as some kind of sound waves), and checking out points of interest that survivors would need to accomplish goals.  As the match progresses, Jason gets stronger and is able to detect survivors easier.  His powers also start to come online since you start with one but more unlock during the match.\n\nThe game does a good job of representing what you see in the movies.  I think overall that DBD is the more balanced and fun game, but I can see how others enjoy Friday more since it plays way differently.  When I have a good, full group going, I think Friday can be the more fun experience, but that's not the norm.  \n\nI hope we see more games do what Friday did while offering a more balanced and glitch free experience.  Texas looks promising, but you never know how these games will turn out.  I like DBD, a lot, but it's more a violent game of tag than a game trying to simulate a horror movie.  Friday the 13th was trying to let you play what you saw in the movies.  It wasn't the best game, but it was fun.",

There hasn't been any new films since 2009, which is pretty crazy when you consider how popular of a franchise it is. \n\nDead by Daylight in particular isn't struggling in the same way, but more just because it has a lot of IP licensed in it and eventually they can't afford all of them. I don't think DbD has actually lost anything other then the Stranger Things content, which ended up being because Netflix just wanted to explore other deals with other games. \n\nHowever, despite all that, the F13 game being delisted was kind of inevitable. It's a licensed game, and the developers can't pay those rights perpetually, especially when they're not making a lot of money on the game. This kind of thing happens with lots of games.",

The IP holder gets their big sum of money for the short term license either way. They have nothing to lose.\n\nWhat I'm talking about prevents games with licensed content from being delisted like this game (I remember a Metal Gear game was also delisted because it had copyrighted WW footage?). I don't understand how and why the game has to sell a lot at full price later on.\n\nThe publisher paid a big flat sum initially to the IP holder to use the IP for a given number of years. That contract is over now but the game still exists.  Now the IP holder can't ask the same amount for the IP rights because the game isn't generating the same amount of revenue, if they do, the publisher would have no way but to stop selling the game (or shut down the game or remove the related content from the game if it's a live service game), like we are seeing here now.\n\nNow the IP holder gets zero money just like the publisher. But if the IP holder was to agree to renew the contract based on getting a percentage of sales then it would be a different story.",

But if the IP holder was to agree to renew the contract based on getting a percentage of sales then it would be a different story.\n\nIt's about leverage and control. The IP holder still owns the IP. If they don't think they'll make a significant amount of money with this game (through low sales or heavy discounts), they drop the contact and license it elsewhere instead. Tying their payment to a % in perpetuity makes it unreliable income. And allowing your IP to be used in perpetuity means you have less control over the quality of it. If you start with a perpetual contract and the game they make is really bad, suddenly your IP is forever tied to that bad game - and I also assume there's noncompete clauses in those contracts which would prevent the IP holder from licensing to another similar product, so suddenly they don't have any options.\n\nIf this were a small indie creator licensing an original character or song or something, people would think they were being taken advantage of if they signed a perpetual license",

That's quite the difference when it comes to legal rights and MK only needs the license to the character and not a movie.\n\nDon't know the full details but I think the FF13 game went into legal hell because the rights of each version of Jason, FF13, it's music, and more was split between a LOT of people due to being split over SEVERAL movies and it only takes 1 to grind things into a halt.\n\nDbD got around this legal nightmare with Ghostface for example because they got the rights to the Ghostface mask from Fun World and not the Ghostface character from Scream. Once they had the rights to use that mask, they made their own version of Ghostface as a totally unique character and thus have near total control over that character. DbD just needs to get an OK for edits to the mask and it's easy to get those OKs as Fun World can easily take those new designs and make a *killing* in making new Halloween costumes.\n\nThe Nightmare (Freddy) is in a bit of a legal hiccup because they got the rights to use the remake Freddy and are subject to ALL of those legal headaches as that version of Freddy is owned by several people. Meaning that DbD can't really do much with Freddy at all outside of game balance without the OK from any/all people who own the remake Freddy. And so Freddy got delayed for the Switch version of DbD and it's also why Freddy never got a single cosmetic.\n\nOnryo is another example. They have the rights to use the original Ringu version of Sadako, not \"The Ring\" version of Sadako. Same character name, but different characters and different rights owners. It's more or less the same for all other licensed Killers. DbD either has the rights for that exact version of the character, or the rights to make their own version of the character. Demopuppy was taken away from DbD simply because Netflix is ran by a bunch of fucking idiots. \n\nIt's confusing as hell.",

The rights to a lot of well known horror franchises are spread all over the god damn place and are constantly changing hands. This makes it damn near impossible to lock in any type of deal because while one franchise holder might give the green light for a license, they can turn around and sell it six months later and the new company can put an end to whatever.\n\nDBD is a unique case because the game started as it\u2019s own IP and slowly incorporated real horror icons. (I assume) as the game grew more popular, it piqued the interest of other horror franchises to want to get in on the action and let their IPs on the game as I\u2019m sure Behavior games pays a hefty sum on top of positive exposure within the dbd fans.\n\nThat said, if whoever owns the rights to Jason, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET BEHAVIOR PUT HIM IN DBD FOR FUCKS SAKE.",

Most games don't make a lot of sales after the end of a console generation, so a license that is roughly a console generation long is a practical choice.\n\nThe only way the practice comes to an end is if game companies start paying for perpetual licenses, but those come at a premium if they're even available at all. Ultimately we'd just either not get these games, or they'd be worse for having spent significantly more on licenses and less on the game itself.",

Obviously different in this case, but I'm just saying there's a ton of licensing going on that you never even really hear about.",

It's somewhat common for movies on streaming services, much less common for physical releases (although it has led to some pretty big movies being out of print).\n\nThere are two big reasons why:\n\nOne, the music industry is dominated (75%) by the \"Big Three\" recording companies: Universal, Warner, and Sony. The film industry is dominated (85%) by the \"Big Five\" film companies: Universal, Warner, Sony, Paramount, and Disney. You'll notice that three of them are the same. Universal Pictures movies mostly use Universal Music Group music, Sony Pictures movies mostly use Sony Music Group music, etc, and obviously mostly under totally unrestricted deals.\n\nTwo, the movie industry realized that re-releasing old content was still a source of revenue 50 years ago, when VHS became a thing, so they typically do very long-term contracts that they ensure will let them re-release movies on home video for decades. It's only pretty recently that keeping video games on sale for over 5 years, let alone re-releasing them on new platforms or remastering them, has attracted much interest. The rate of change has _really_ slowed down in the industry so nowadays it seems obvious that 10 year old games are still of interest, but for most of gaming's history, anything over about 5 years old was an absolute relic, not just technologically but in terms of game design, and no one imagined it'd be worth paying for long-term rights.",

Kill x by throwing them out the window, drown x and x while they are skinny dipping etc.. there are cinematics in this one as well so its like watching scenes from the movies so its cool for fans of the franchise. They are short and can be completed 100% in a few hours but are still fun. If you can get the game for like $5 id say they are worth checking out. \n\nThe other single player mode is the virtual cabin which is a first person mode where you go through a cabin and see history and trivia for the F13 franchise. There are puzzles in this to unlock new areas but unfortunately the whole point of this was to get a tease for all the Jason X content that would have come to the game which never did. \n\nFinally there is an offline mode with bots but dont bother. I think you can only play as Jason and the Counselor AI is non existent. They are all constantly running into walls or just standing still.",

(The ones you unlock) because it becomes, grab counsellor, press button, they are gone. It's broken over powered and if I recall correctly the devs wanted to rebalance that until they lost the rights and couldn't continue working on it. We allow Jason to use the environment to get instant kills because that's a bit more fair, he has to walk somewhere. Kinda like Dead By Daylight, so you have some time or atleast a chance to escape him without a knife or a friend around. \n\nThere's a modded client that has cut content and new features in the game.

The license might just be tight and constrained to 1 movie/piece of media as a result (like Ash Williams is from the Ash vs Evil Dead show, and all of his cosmetics are from the show) but it's much better than nothing.",

I understand the need to limit the production of new content about a licensed product and that it can't be done for free indefinitely, but on the other hand shutting down content that people already paid access for seems like a bad thing too.  This makes me think that no one should ever try to make a licensed title without the express understanding that it will go away someday, if not have it clearly defined up front.",

I thought the servers shut down like a year or two ago, and we could only play offline or with directconnection.  \n\n\nSo when they say still functional until next year, do they mean that once the server shuts off, even if I have the game I can't play it with bots?",

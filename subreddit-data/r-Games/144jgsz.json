I think there's kind of a learning curve where you might have to restart a few times to understand the mechanics and choose a class that works for you, but don't get discouraged, even failing can be fun! I'd highly recommend it, but if you're new to the genre, you might try Divinity 2 first as it goes on sale often enough.",

Lore-wise, knowing Forgotten Realms lore will enhance your experience but the story is much more centred around the characters you have with you. \n\nIt's similar, in a broad sense, to Larian Studio's Divinity Original Sin games. Check those out if you're unsure and if you don't like that style of game, you probably won't like BG3.\n\nLarian's games usually reward creative thinking and out of the box ideas, so combat can probably be avoided in some areas but is also an integral part of the game. You'll be surprised how much they expect you to try the unexpected in every situation.",

It's one of the greatest RPGs of all time in my opinion. It's not quite based on 5E but it's similar, and super influenced by tabletop RPGs - probably the closest I've ever felt playing tabletop from playing a video game. It's also the reason Larian was signed to do BG3",

NPC lines tends to have tons of references - I think Xzar is just as bad, if not worst than Minsc in terms of jokey/reference dialogue (quoting Oppenheimer/Bhagavad Gita, Silence of the Lambs, Of Mice and Men, etc). The game had meta NPCs like Lord Foreshadow and Biff the Understudy, or references like Larry, Darryl and Darryl, and a *\"woodsman\" named Peter of the North*. \n\nBG2 is definitely more serious, and probably the darkest of the series given what happens to your companions, especially Imoen. The NPCs are less jokey than BG1, but Minsc, Jan, and Edwin are still pretty comical, and you also get quite a bit of that too given the right pairings (i.e. Korgan with Mazzy). SoA for the most part is decently serious, but I think it actually gets back to pretty jokey in TOB when you have sequences like Bondari Reloads or the Chinchilla Bhaalspawn as a part of the main quests. \n\nWhere does BG3 Early Access fit in terms of story tone? I think you can make an argument it actually takes itself as seriously as BG2 if not more than it, but it's definitely less dark. There's some grossness and gore but nothing as grim as things implied in Irenicus's dungeon, or Viconia's story. But for the most part there isn't a ton of jokes and references (so far). The most silly aspects of BG3 Early Access probably comes from talking to various animals (there's a spell that lets you do that), and a few select scenes.",

I think you can make an argument it actually takes itself as seriously as BG2 if not more than it\n\nwell I sure hope you're right about this part!\n\nBG2 is in my top-5 RPGs of all time, and I've been playing tons of RPGs across both PC+consoles since I was a kid in the 1980s. (BG1 is not as good, partly because of the reasons you described)\n\nso when I heard it was given to Larian, I was sorely mad. but given your quote above, I'll keep an eye on it. I don't need it to be gory or grim necessarily... just serious",

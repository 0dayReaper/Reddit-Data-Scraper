Over the last 18 months I've been working on a modern city builder in a retro style, inspired by the classic pixel art games of the 90s and 00s. Check out my subreddit or twitter for clips. \n\nIm also heavily inspired by modern day base builders/colony sims (Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld), and wanted to bring individual agent simulation to the city building genre.\n\nOther features:\n\n* Design your own buildings, save them as blue prints\n\n* Agents will utilize specific room and objects in the game\n\n* Agents will have schedules, go to work, shop, etc. \n\n* Real time traffic, just like Cities: Skylines\n\n* Plus building off all the core city building elements of the classics!",

A unit will drive out of  (not leave) the city if it wants/needs something that your city does not offer (then return after)\n\nMayoral decisions: I assume you mean policy?

            "comment": "Looks nice, but it seems very car-centric. Will you add public transport? Sidewalks? Pedestrian-only streets? \n\n\"Manage real-time traffic\" can be done in more ways than optimizing roads, there is a large push against the car-centric approach to city planning in favor of the \"15-minute city\" where citizens should be able to walk/commute to work/shopping/entertainment. \n\nSeems like every city builder just has the 50s car-is-king urban planning ideology.\n\nSorry if I sound a bit rash, but there are more ways to do city planning than around cars.\n\nBuses, subways, trams, **walking**, bicycle, etc, create more dynamic and interesting neighborhoods, where human interaction is the focal point rather than the car. Eliminating the car from urban planning can greatly increase the density of buildings which in turn increases land exploitation for humans to live and have businesses on the bottom floor. \n\nWhich in turn would make your game unique in the city-building genre :) \n\n[You can do some google street view of the Gothic Quarters in Barcelona for example](https://www.google.com/maps/@41.3859012,2.1799267,3a,90y,4.38h,90.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1se0Euaab8xqZMygynuIHpUQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).\n\n[Or Utrecht in Netherlands](https://www.google.com/maps/@52.0946032,5.1182212,3a,75y,187.38h,86.42t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sRmaoKXnO_U0kz8ORaN6n3w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu)\n\n[Or Gamla Stan in Stockholm](https://www.google.com/maps/@59.3236155,18.0701759,3a,75y,329.12h,83.95t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sv8Gbn121zdW4Z-Ism5c70g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu)",

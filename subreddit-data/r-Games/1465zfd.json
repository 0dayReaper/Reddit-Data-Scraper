Now it's all very naturalistic and nuanced (or attempting to)\n\nIf this is successful they should totally do a Mask of Zorro game. Zorro is public domain after all.",

The sword gameplay is great, especially with the tricks.\n\nThat said, it had some noticeable frame drops here and there, and it crashed once. So it still needs to polishing around the edges.\n\nEdit: Also. This being a game set in Spain, I really hope that we get Spanish audio.",

The idea of using the environment to incapacitate in fun ways just resonates a lot from that short trailer.  Really different tone but it's good to see someone try something like it again.  Probably haven't had something like that since Bulletstorm.",

Like at 0:49 where the enemy stumbling backwards from the kick just *barely* manages to trigger a \"falling down the stairs backwards\" animation but in a way that makes me more excited that you can trigger something like that in the first place (on a non-dead enemy, aka it's not just a ragdoll). It just seems like they've reached, in a really nice gamey way, for having a lot of ways to use the environment in your fight.\n\nbut i haven't tried the demo yet lol",

You are constantly bobbing and weaving between enemies while pulling off the most satisfying combo styles ever put in a game. And the boss fights are a true test of player skill while never feeling like they are impossible the first time through. A lot of the strategy comes down to crowd control and knowing when to defend versus when to attack, while keeping your high combos up above all costs. \n\nOne of the hardest games I've ever beat, but also the most rewarding. Been putting off another playthrough for a while because I know it's gonna take a few good ass kickings before I learn the controls again.",

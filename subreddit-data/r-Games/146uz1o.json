    "postText": "Hello, my name is Etienne, I am the developer for **Breach Wanderers**.  \n\nBreach Wanderers was slated to release out of Early Access a few weeks ago. On that day, I was instead informed by my publisher that they were terminating our contract and would not be publishing the game in order to focus on their own franchise. I've had to delay the game and scramble to try and cobble together a release plan. I'm now finally ready to release it, after 4 years of development.  \n\nBreach Wanderers is the first **Constructed Roguelite Deckbuilder!** Not only do you get to craft your starting deck, but also the pool of possible card rewards that you'll find during a run. You still get the a lot of the randomness of a traditional roguelite deckbuilder, with randomized events, enemies and card rewards, but by being able to choose your pool of cards, you get to decide the direction in which that run is going. The game is filled to the brim with content, with 10 completely unique heroes, more than 1200 cards, hundreds of enemies and more difficulty levels than you could ever dream of.\n\nBreach Wanderers is available as a premium product on Steam, and as a free-to-play game on Google Play and on the App Store. It already has a vibrant community on Discord, and averages 9.5/10 in user score across all three platforms.  \n\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/3i_Flr6gcm4\n\nSteam Page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1394130/Breach_Wanderers  \nGoogle Play Page: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BaronnerieGames.Rift  \nApp Store Page: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/breach-wanderers/id1585235445",

Feel how you will about it, but releasing a premium product to the mobile market doesn't sell as well as a f2p. I own the Steam product and it's a pretty good game, and it's succeeded on both so calling it a bad move is flat out wrong, lmao.",

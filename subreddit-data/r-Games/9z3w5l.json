    "postText": "In the second Fallout 76 Review Thread people were postulating that critics were scared of giving a Bethesda game a bad score and were withholding their reviews. In light of that, it felt worth putting this out there: yesterday Jeff Gerstmann of Giantbomb.com said it\u2019s unlikely his site will have a review of it because nobody likes the game enough to finish it. \n\nOf the west coast crew on the podcast, only Brad Shoemaker mentioned the possibility of playing more. Given that the east coast crew has barely mentioned Fallout 76\u2019s existence in their podcasts, they are probably in the same \u201cstaff\u201d that Gerstmann said was uninterested. Most of the staff has dabbled in Fallout 76 and moved back to RDR2, onward to Hitman 2 and other new releases, or are playing games they think they\u2019ll need to discuss in Game of the Year podcasts. \n\nGerstmann\u2019s exact quote from yesterday\u2019s Bombcast was, **\u201cNo one on staff wants to play anymore of this videogame [Fallout 76]. I\u2019m not going to subject myself to another 20-30 hours of this [expletive] mess to just put a number on it. My number is \u2018Don\u2019t play this game\u2019.\u201d**\n\nBy \u201cnumber,\u201d he obviously meant giving the game a score.\n\n[You can get their thoughts on what they\u2019ve played from the podcast itself, which I'm linking with a time stamp for their discussion of the game.](https://youtu.be/ytnL9Ju-hZo?t=1745) The room was a mixture of confusion over design choices and general negativity. Gerstmann feels Fallout needed refinement and drastic improvements after Fallout 4, and that all other complaints aside, Fallout 76 has simply stripped things out rather than improving anything.",

I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019re skipping Fallout 76 as it\u2019s clear no one [at Giant Bomb]  has any enthusiasm for that game. \n\nedit: I mean people working at Giant Bomb.",

I have to imagine a new engine is going into the next elder scrolls.\n\nEdit: But as I've been informed, it's not. And the fact that it won't have a new engine sucks, because as others have stated below Bethesda is lazy and even if they did have a new engine they are still lazy, unfortunately.",

I saw the [Digital Foundry video about BF5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYLLvOFSHCU) today and what DICE have created there in terms of graphical and audio fidelity, especially factoring in the RTX support on PC looks and sounds nothing short of phenomenal. And even on the consoles it runs really well, with the effects work toned down, obviously. I don't know about BF5 framerates but considering BF1 ran at 60 fps even on the base consoles and looked fantastic even in huge MP battles, Frostbyte is obviously very optimized and highly scalable.",

Bethesda's style is \"Does it kinda work? Sweet, it's good enough!\" as far as I can tell...Something like the dragon animations in Skyrim absolutely should have been very carefully looked into to be less janky before release and *definitely* should not have been maintained into SkyrimSE...But that also hasn't got as much to do with Gamebryo/Creation being incapable of good animations as it is Bethesda rarely managing to actually create a good animation system for an action or figure out transitioning between different animations smoothly.\n\n\nI seriously, genuinely hope Bethesda do not go to a new engine for the simple fact that they'd still retain their lazy characteristics that cause these problems but completely lack the *decades* of experience they have working with their current tools, along with possibly having to create all-new tools to do things they made heavy use of in their previous developments. Going from nearly every other software development that's gone down the same path, we'd end up with a buggier, worse product. (That said, I'm all for a new engine if it's something completely out there like a brand new engine that retains use of the old file formats for simplicity and because there's nothing wrong with them at all, is entirely internal Bethesda code at first for legalities sake and is quickly open sourced so that modders, etc can actually help build on it. Bethesda could just grab a snapshot of the code, add onto it themselves and have a much cheaper way of having a very up to date engine while also making the potential for HD Remakes a lot easier if the community is allowed to maintain compatibility between different games on newer versions of the engine. It'd also likely remain similar enough to Creation that they can retain a lot of that experience they've built up while fixing the actual problems with their development process.)",

However even with the transition to 64bit both FO4 and FO76 have HUGE performance problems. It\u2019s 2012 graphics bringing 2018 hardware to it\u2019s knees. While there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s partly Bethesda, within a week of shipping a single modder sharpened their muddy crap textures in FO4 and dramatically reduced them in size, I still wonder if at this point they\u2019ve put off fixing and updating Creation in the kind of substantive ways they need to the point where fixing Creation would be as much work as just migrating over to something like Unreal 4. I seriously doubt that Bethesda has the technical chops in house to actually fix Creation even if they wanted to.\n",

It started with Fallout 4, but it\u2019s crazy to me that nobody cares about a new Fallout  game and it\u2019s actively disliked when Fallout and Bethesda used to be two of the most exciting things in games.

Fallout 76 is a shitty haphazardly thrown together mess simply created to pad their bottom line in between FO4 and their next blockbuster. A few patches to smooth out the glitches, a dash of dlc thrown in here and there, and you'll have a recipe for silent compliance. \n\nHello Game's No Man's Sky, love it or hate, has proven that you can release a shitty broken game to the masses and then spend the next two years patching it up to make your player base happy. I know, I am one of those players. Destiny 2? Same thing. I swore after the joke that was the Curse of Osiris that I'd never buy another destiny DLC, here I am grinding Forsaken like a broke circus monkey. Maybe I have poor judgment. Maybe I can't get off the hype train. Maybe I'm not willing to believe that my favorite series are being destroyed for monetary value. But its these sentiments that Bungie and Bethesda are banking on to sell their games now, and fix them later. And, like it or not, that's becoming the new paradigm for software development. \n\nBut, mark my words, people will buy Fallout 5, they will buy the next Oblivion, and they will buy the next DOOM. Fallout 76 will be forgotten or at least become a painful distant memory. Like that time I got pantsed in gym class during the fifth grade. ",

Likewise there's no reason for the world to still be such a shithole so many years removed from when the bombs fell.

Apparently they contacted every available military base with surviving personnel. Roger Maxson called upon them telling that the system has failed and it is their duty to preserve the technology and knowledge of old to rebuild in the future (BoS idea has changed since then though). Satellites were failing, so the communication didn't last long. As for FO76's \"chapter\" - Paladin Taggerty was a ranger who once served together with Maxson, so they knew each other. ",

In the lore so far, there was actually a massive network of human survivors(called the Responders because it was founded by police and firefighters) who were doing a damn fine job of rebuilding/re-adapting society. A few months before Vault 76 opened, the Scorched wiped them out. Hell some of them seem to have been dead only a few days when you find them.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough into the story to know what the Scorched are exactly. The previously human ones are infected with some kind of plague and mind controlled by the Scorch Beasts(basically giant bat dragons). So far the story is implying that a lot of the creatures and possibly the Scorched have nothing to do with the war or radiation(or at least, not just the radiation). West Virginia was basically being used as a giant landfill by a bunch of companies making all kinds of nasty shit in the name of aiding the war effort. You find tons of stuff about people getting sick from pollution and one company that may have basically been fracking using some kind of version of FEV-like chemical.",

He plays bad games and gives his negative impressions frequently and so do the rest of the staff. The Giant Bomb staff have \"reviewed\" or have done longer produced content (podcast sections, Unprofessional Fridays sections, Quick Looks) for games they end up (or start with) disliking.\n\nHearing Jeff's time with the game and the Quick Look with Brad Shoemaker... the game is not good. The game is unpolished and lacking all the charm the Bethesda (not the Interplay ones) have. It's terribly disappointing. I'm a huge Fallout fan and I was considering giving 76 a chance.\n\nFallout 76 looks like The Elder Scrolls Online, but worse. Jeff Gerstmann doesn't want to touch the game anymore and I can't blame him. The rest of the industry is largely aligning with his views.\n\nGiant Bomb is more entertainment, with a huge amount of industry experience and varied viewpoints to provide context and legitimate experience, than journalism, even though they have a great amount of experience in that. When a staff member goes out of their way to say they won't touch the game anymore for any content purposes (and making content like that would probably garner a great amount of views just for entertainment)... that's when you know it's a terrible experience.",

I just hope more can be a little more self aware of their abilities and scope. \n\nThese people need to have an end goal that they can accomplish before throwing up their concept work to the world to spend money on. If anything it\u2019s made me more cynical and less trusting of game developers, which I don\u2019t want! I want to have faith that people can accomplish what they say they can accomplish.

Yakuza's is way, way smaller, but filled to the brim with content. In every corner there is something to do. Meaningful things as well, and not only repeating side quests.\nBig does not equal good. But for whatever reason publishers can market it as if it was.",

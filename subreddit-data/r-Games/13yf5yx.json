In RDR2 you tap the left stick in to run and then again to sprint. In GTA V, you tap the left stick in to run but have to *hold* it down to sprint, which is awkward. If they just adopt RDR2's method, they will have essentially fixed the issue after 10 years.",

The economy has always been messed up and as a long time player it seems like its easier than it's ever been to farm cash for things.  Back when I first started it seemed like contact missions were the best way to make money and that would take 20 or more hours of solid gameplay to buy a single super-car. Now I do Cayo Perico solo and get between 1m and 2m in an hour and a half if I'm slow. So like 3 or 4 hours for even the most expensive stuff. \n\nI totally agree with you about the researching online thing though. It seems like pretty much anything besides contact missions can make you decent cash but you are totally right that there are some things that are way better than others and it makes a huge difference. If you are just starting out it really pays to know where to spend your first few million to make the most out of the investment.",

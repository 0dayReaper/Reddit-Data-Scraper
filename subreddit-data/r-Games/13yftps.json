I hope we see more of this beyond Pride month.\n\nThe current political landscape is increasingly tough for queer people, so it's nice that the games industry is more affirming than ever.",

It is now profitable to be supportive of the queer community (in some markets at least), which is a good thing regardless of if the companies are only taking part for brownie points.",

                                    "comment": "\"Homophobes from both extremes\" is a warning sign that any genuine reply would be wasted on you, but I digress. There are absolutely legitimate reasons for queer people to be turned off by the corporatization of pride month, including the fact that corporations tend to sanitize anything they touch which results in queer spaces and events being sanitized so as to be more 'safe' and attractive for sponsors or whatever the fuck else. Not every queer person gets a stiffie at the idea of cishets being able to profit off of us.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the fact that corporate 'inclusion' is often extremely half assed. The most infamous recent example I can think of is the Oreo Twitter account's \"trans people exist\" tweet, which was so fucking useless a sentiment that it was worse than them having said nothing at all. And at best it is the usual \"trans people are so valid!\" performative allyship bullshit. Just saying \"trans rights\" means absolutely nothing if you're not actually going to talk about trans people's struggles - disproportionate lack of access to healthcare, homelessness, abuse, and so on and so forth. \n\nAnd besides that, corporations only choose, again, the safest, most sanitized depictions of queer people, which leaves a lot of people whose existences are more stigmatized out in the cold. And don't forget that even this miniscule attempt at performative bullshit only occurs in countries where it's already socially acceptable to support queer people.\n\nBut no, yeah, every queer person who hates corporations is actually just a degenerate, communist homophobe, which is a sentiment that no right winger has ever expressed, wink wink.",

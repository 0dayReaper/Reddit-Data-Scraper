I was in shock how black didn't see it. But then after the body was found they both vouched for each other. It carried on this way until white won. The other dead players and I called him out after the game and he admitted to it, and called us ni99ers. I couldn't find a way to report it, so I just quit.\n\nMoral of the story is that people suck.",

He can cheat by changing kill cool down, being imposter every round, changing everyone's appearance and names and the round as well. Sadly he doesn't understand why no one wants to play with him anymore",

I played a game last night where I joined the lobby as the colour black and some dude instantly said, before the game started that I was imposter. I just thought he was being a bit of a jackass, but then I got imposter, huh what luck. So I played, scored a kill then later someone reported it and that guy instantly said it was me again. Idk if he necessarily swayed anyone but another person claimed to have seen me on cams so I pretty much couldn't argue it or verify it so I lost.",

Culling 1 was super dead from terrible design/management decisions before there was much of anything about Culling 2.  The sequel seemed more like a last ditch chance to salvage the dumpster fire.\n\nBut I'm probably off on the timeline on that, so someone let me know.",

The way the sequel was handled, with people still playing the first one waiting on promised changes/fixes and stuff killed off that player base as well without even creating a new one because of how poorly received it was on its own. I mean, personal opinion, but I'd say a sequel and the business side of its release being so bad that it kills the whole series counts.",

It may be more profitable NOT to make a sequel as opposed to a slow burn of content updates to monetize. Among us doesn't gain that much from a sequel unless they have a truly novel direction to take the series.\n\nHollow Knight's DLC turned to full game is a good example to the contrary. they have a proven success based on a more traditional game structure of \"release a full game with a full story\". Not worth shoving in a $10 DLC over expanding the many ideas they have into a $30 full game.",

In the early days Riot had no clue how successful LoL could become and how much force could be behind gaming youtubers back in 2010. They thought it would be a nice marketing gimmick but nobody would ever get 1000 referals if I remeber the number correctly. But when TotalBiscuit reached that number they wanted to back out of it and tried to deny most of the perks like creating his own champion.  \nThe whole thing turned sour and TB publically denounced Riot a few times and said he\u2018d never do any more LoL content because of how they behaved. He wasn\u2018t even the only one. Athene, the \u201edo it for the kidzzz\u201c guy, also managed to get the amount needed and was shot down.  \nIn the end they gave both some reference items with Athene getting Athenes Holy Grail and TB getting a health item. But I am pretty sure that TB was pissed off with Riot to his death for how they treated him even though he kickstarted LoL in the early days.",

Offers things people actually want and are happy to pay for if you spend, but the game doesn't try to push you hard into paying either. You don't feel like the game hates you if you don't pay, so you only spend out of genuine desire to buy something (which makes the purchase feel a lot more fun.)",

If the original is old, the split will be smaller, if the original is booming in popularity, it has a solid chance to kill both games.\n\nWhich is why I can't for the life of me figure out why a brand new game like Overwatch, in terms of a competitive multiplayer only game, is releasing a sequel so soon. People still play competitive games well past a decade.",

That way people who aren't interested in PvE won't get confused and think they have to upgrade to the new game and people who aren't interested in the online game can save a few bucks by just buying the PvE game.\n\nBut I'm willing to bet that they did think it through and are banking on the confusion leading to more sales from those who don't keep up with the news and just see the big \"2\" on the box and think that it's an entirely new game.",

That has nothing to do with gameplay. \n\nIt's also the most immediate way people can find a game appealing. Not like can know how something will play or feel by looking at most trailers. Games are also a visual medium. \n\nI only ever hear this being brought up like this by people defending a game based on gameplay when someone complains about its graphics.",

No AA, low res pixelated shadows etc.\n\nBut the gameplay is outstanding so people still play the game despite the objectively terrible graphics they are seeing.\n\nThe most common complaint is not even the graphics but the performance. Can you imagine TOTK looking and feeling like Immortals Fenyx rising?\n\nWell I can, move to PC with emulation and the enjoyment of the experience gets multiplied.\n\nI\u2019m one of those people who can\u2019t be subjugated to play on a subpar platform even if the gameplay is good enough. I don\u2019t want Crysis level realism but acceptable performance.",

            "comment": "Games studio loves graphic the same way Hollywood loves special effect.\n\nWriting new good stories is hard; making innovative game mechanics is hard. And risky, because it's hard to know if people will like these or not. It's much easier to recycle old ideas.\n\nBut graphics/special effects? They take a lot of man-hour to do, but the method is very well understood. They know they can do it well as long as they spend money. It also makes the game/movie much easier to advertise. And big studio has a lot of money they can spend. So why put up with risk when they could just spend money for stable outcomes?",

            "comment": "I think there are games that have gotten a pass on unremarkable gameplay due to their visual fidelity being of such a high quality.\n\nBut in regards to how people enjoy their games, is that necessarily a bad thing?  If someone gets their enjoyment from the visual spectacle on display but the gameplay is rudimentary, why is that a negative?\n\nTake Visual Novels for example.  From a gameplay perspective they tend to be very basic, but most people who play them are doing so not for the gameplay but to engage in the story with the characters.\n\nAt the end of the day people play games for enjoyment of some form.",

            "comment": "I think the argument of graphics over gameplay is a bit twisted now. Cause, it's not really a fight between the two anymore. What we are seeing, especially in the AAA space is the streamlining of both. \n\nMore and more games follow the same structure, have very similar graphic showpieces and are having their gameplay dumbed down. Companies like Ubisoft literally work with templates, where they just mix and match the themes and pump out the new Far Cry, AC, etc. Sony games look different enough for you to think they are unique, but the more you play, the more you see that they are all hitting the same notes and all following the same structures, to the point of having similar ways to simplify already simplistic gameplay. Capcom is currently the one I would argue is the most unique in terms of catalogue, but even then you can see the shadow of templates, the RE remakes being all cut from the same cloth and the streamlining of gameplay is also pretty evident. \n\nAnd that is not necessarily a bad thing. I at least I'm growing old and the older I get the less time I have to game. So having these games simpler, to understand visually and simpler to play is actually a benefit. But, I do feel we are moving on to a future where a lot of those games will be made or at least build with AI tools. And we aren't really going to be able to see much of a difference.",

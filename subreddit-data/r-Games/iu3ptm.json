I guess it means the only familiar characters will be ghosts and portraits, which is fine given that the OG cast, while iconic, have been done to death. \n\nAlso looks like we'll be visiting Hogsmead and Azkaban, which is really cool. I wonder if they gonna show some Victorian Wizarding London too. I'm curious how much of a student sim this is - does it carry us through all 7 years or does it take place during a single one?",

They want to get you further into the meat of the game rather than having a massive multi-hour tutorial where they blaze through your first few years. I have a feeling it will be a little jarring, but saved them a mountain of time in development. \n\nHaving children would require tons of different models, facial customization, animations, changes to the school, mechanics of opening doors, exploring, etc all to be reworked for a child sized player character over a more adult sized player character. It shaves off millions of dollars from the bill and allows that time and money to be spent on the meat and potatoes of the game, rather than a 1 time experience on the front-end of the game.",

They just have spells they throw into categories haphazardly based on what class you learn them in. So I hope there's actual structure to this and possibly a way to combine, alter or invent your own.\n\nIt's also going to be a big question just *how much* freedom will you have. Will you get railroaded into the Hero Story with a Bioware-style Saint-vs-Asshole slider that affects little? Or can you go be a ~~Death Eater~~ **Skull-Faced Killer** and besiege your classmates?",

Compared to most fantasy/magic settings, Harry Potter's is not in depth at all, esp. for a \"magic academy\" setting. There's no inherent limitations, no real costs to casting, no real thread or connection between spells and magical effects. \n\nFor a game it needs to be built basically from the ground up. \n\nBut I am psyched for a proper magic academy setting, I do feel like it has a lot of potential for games, and would be the type of game that I'd describe if you asked my 12 year old self to describe one of his ideal/dream games.",

Or transformations of bigger objects being harder than smaller ones.\n\nNow, I have no idea how they\u2019d incorporate that into a game.",

With every MMO I try though, I've learned that at least with WoW, if I come back I'll always have fun in their group pve content. I still haven't seen an MMO that does dungeons and raids quite as well as they do. They do pve progression and challenge for groups and guilds really well. \n \nI also haven't been able to find an MMO that is as fun and intense to heal in as a group like WoW. Probably a testament to their 15+ years of working out the flow of group pve combat in that game. \n \nI just wish WoW was action combat. Black Desert will always be my favorite combat system for an MMO I think. Amazing animations, great combo system that worked incredibly well on mouse and keyboard.  \nThat game was just ruined by cash shop pay to win RNG progression, and essentially no end game whatsoever because it was not sandboxy enough to make your own fun longterm, and the pvp did not work well at all with their server performance and absurd gear imbalance.",

Your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. You have received a late acceptance to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and soon discover that you are no ordinary student: you possess an unusual ability to perceive and master Ancient Magic. Only you can decide if you will protect this secret for the good of all, or yield to the temptation of more sinister magic.\n\n&gt; Discover the feeling of living at Hogwarts as you make allies, battle Dark wizards, and ultimately decide the fate of the wizarding world. Your legacy is what you make of it.\n\nFrom their website. Sure looks like the description of a single player open world RPG indeed",

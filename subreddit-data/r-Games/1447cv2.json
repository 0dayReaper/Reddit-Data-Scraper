I'm kinda hoping for MH:6 news, but I think Capcom's position is to go play Sunbreak, Exoprimal, SF6 and Dragon's Dogma 2. I'm most excited for DD2 though, so I'm not too worried.\n\nHonestly, I would recommend checking out Capcom's other games, because they are crushing it. I know it's unfortunate that they aren't really anything like Ace Attorney, but their output has been so incredible that it can't be denied. Besides, their official position for Ace Attorney fans in the short term is to probably check out Phantom Detective, where there is a high probability you haven't played it.",

In was an improvement on the formula instead. \n\nAnd following that logic, Rise&amp;Sunbreak would've been the next iteration on the formula of World&amp;Iceborne (and it is, in a way), but it doesn't seem to be considered as that.",

All I can just say is, if you're not bad at puzzles, you really should give it a try. They even have a hint coin system so you can't get *too* stuck. ANd if all else fails, look up the solution.",

Hope dragons dogma 2 kicks ass (and also makes it easier to understand how vocations and stuff works, always had trouble with that in the original).",

The skills you can purchase depend on your currently equipped vocation and your rank in that vocation. You earn dp every time you earn xp. Some skills can be quipped in multiple vocations, even if they are only purchasable in one vocation. So if you want a fighter that uses the skill intimate strike, you need to level your assasin vocation (someone correct if I am wrong about this, its off the top of my head). This also applies to your pawn.\n\nIts ultimately a job system, like in Final Fantasy games, but you can mix skills. If your arisen is already using a sword as a fighter, and they know the assasin vocation, it makes sense for them to use assasin skills even when they are doing g the fighter vocation.\n\nIts not really that bad, but I agree that it should be explained way better. It also makes no sense that you have to go back to an inn to switch your skills. The arisen knows how to perform these skills, idm why they have to get permission from an inn keeper to do it. DD online alleviates this a bit with kill pallettes that you can switch between in the field, but I definitely hope capcom just makes it kind of like the way they have it in SF6 world tour mode currently.",

Dino Crisis was Resident Evil with Dino's instead of zombies. Deep puzzles, ammo management, spooky environments, etc. \n\nThey just feel like two different genres tied together with Dinosaurs and a woman with red hair lol",

I did play as a warrior, and from the lack of secondary skills to the severe disadvatange against some of the more gimmicky bosses, from lack of ranged attacks, it feels like a lot of cheesing is required to properly enjoy the game.\n\n I feel like the main culprit is that the climbing mechanic is somewhat janky, and provides feel return in terms of sustained DPS vs just spamming ranged attacks from a safe distance at weak spots. By the time you get to where you need to hit as a warrior, you get one or two sings before the boss burns all your stamina, or worst hits you with an attack aimed at something else, throwing you back at the ground to start all over. Liquid Vim becomes absolutely mandatory to try to make it work. \n\n I feel like if you had a mechanic where you could struggle against the monsters flailing to preserve more stamina, and if you could only get hit by actual specific anti-mount attacks, melee would feel a lot better.",

Movement speed is way too slow, and the magic seemed to run on a dichotomy of either instantly deleting enemies or taking 0.1% off their magic-missile-sponge HP bars. Fully willing to believe that's just the demo player being bad at the game, but definitely need to see reviews.",

I am also really not a fan of going 3rd person for cutscenes and seeing the main character.  Admittedly because I really *don't* want to see him.  He seems generic and unlikeable.  Like an edgier Starlord or something.",

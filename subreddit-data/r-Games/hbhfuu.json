CDPR has built their reputation off the incredible success of Witcher 3 as a masterpiece and that reputation has built expectations for 2077 to absurd levels.  If they launch a piece of garbage it will destroy years of goodwill and likely tank their ability to sell games on this magnitude (seriously, the free PR they have gotten on this is insane).\n\nIt's not killing people and financial losses don't compare to lives lost, but on the scale of risks for their company it would be a catastrophe.  Video game companies don't operate on the same risk tiers as aerospace, so you have to reevaluate what level of damage (financially and PR wise) justifies major overhauls and efforts.",

No new content. I'm so behind because I don't have time to play(prior to covid) and it would take me that long to catch up. Over lockdown I beat 6 games, more than I had beaten in the last year alone, and I wasn't even playing that much. I'm sad this was the reason the delays happened but it solidified my belief that too much damn content comes out, and everything should chill out. I'm happy they delayed cyberpunk, I might even have a clean plate by the time it gets here.",

If you can choose to play the top 50 best rated games of this year or the top 50 best rated games of all time, and can only play your choice for 1 whole year, you will have a much better selection of games with the top 50 of all time.

It was suppose to be a pretty big quest line it seems, almost like Bloody Baron, mainly about the plague. We were suppose to get more Iorveth, Ves, and Roche. One of the few remaining quests for this questline that's actually left in the game is saving Ves from that village in Velen. That's why that quest felt kinda odd and out of place. Alas, this is why there's fuck-all content for Roche and Ves, and Iorveth just got completely cut.",

Iorveth is also a glaring omission.  He is a massive part of Witcher 2, and he is just gone in 3 with absolutely no mention that I can remember.",

But I think with the knowladge of high customer expectation, promise of pre-release reviews and so on, the team is probably going in the right direction. \n\nThink of it less as ironing out flaws and more like assuring what they're offering is truly bang for customers buck. After all, they would rather want this to be fantastic incase future games need this level of development time because \"Hey, they did it with Cyberpunk, and look how great that game is\".",

Many studios get everything required to develop games on a new console probably before said console is even announced to the public at all (hence why so many non-exclusive games coming up will also release on new gen consoles). It only makes sense to let them know the release date so they know if they can prepare for a launch sale which would help both Sony/Microsoft and the developers themselves.",

On the contrary it was one of the best-selling games when it came out.\n\nYou can be a critical flop while being a commercial success and vice versa. This is seen in film all the time.",

Still remember the glowing IGN impressions from a year or so back describing how 'this shouldn't be possible!'.  \n\nThis game is going to have an epic hype-train crash.  It will be a massive downgrade-gate controversy, on top of disappointment over typical open-world gameplay mechanics and an absence of anything really groundbreaking (it's been in development for 8 years).",

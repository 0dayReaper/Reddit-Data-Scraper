Probably would be a smoother entry into the genre than FFT since FFT has very intense difficulty spikes in the beginning and this doesn't have unit perma-death. But I won't say this is a better game or a better story.",

A lot of people at launch compared it to FFT, which it isn\u2019t really trying to be.\n\nTriangle Strategy has a lot more story/dialogue than FFT, features branching paths, and has highly specialized units with little customization. You also get to use a lot of units in combat, and there\u2019s exp scaling which means it\u2019s very easy to level up characters if you\u2019ve had them on the bench for a while, but could really use the dude whose whole gimmick is building ladders and turrets.\n\nMap design is also pretty interesting, with many maps feeing quite unique, and there are some varied objectives in there. Elements also effect the battlefield, somewhat similar to Divinity Original Sin - you can electrocute water, set fields on fire, freeze water, etc.",

I don't remember much about sound, so it was probably fine.",

Levelling/character build system might as well not be there. Writing/story is pretty bad and FAR too much text.  Morality system is silly.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a demo, admittedly it exaggerates the volume of text issue because it\u2019s the start of the game.",

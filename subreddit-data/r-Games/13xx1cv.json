To quote the video: \n\n&gt; \"One of the biggest reasons we play looters, particularly the campaign components of them, is to feel that feel when a sick item drops and it's like \"Fuck yeah let's go!\". Big massive stat increases that make you feel way more powerful than you did just a moment ago, making old stuff feel way easier and making you strong enough to face something you couldn't face before. Diablo 4 *does not give you that feeling.* Ever. Like EVER.\"\n\nThat really sounds off-putting, since as he mentions the rewarding feeling you can get after a lucky find is one of the best experience of playing these types of games.\n\nThe other points he mentions build off that, with the difference between secondary stats not really being able to be felt thus becoming mostly ignorable, and aspects being continuously re-appliable essentially negating the importance of drops further. \n\nSounds like the game has plenty of positives including presentation, performance, story, size, etc, but with the issues mentioned above I'm worried a core element of the genre won't be satisfying.",

Or they\u2019d need to do a system akin to D3 rifts / POE maps which means there\u2019d be little reason to engage with the world itself outside of dungeons. \n\nSecondary stats don\u2019t really feel different to me than in any other game: crit, attack speed, resistances, lucky hit (basically proc chance) so I think they may just not be a huge fan of ARPGs, because that\u2019s generally what items give you. \n\nYou can\u2019t continuously reapply all of the legendary aspects, and the ones which you can are at their lowest possible roll to balance it. Legendary drops will roll it higher (and have some that aren\u2019t in the Codex) and there are still Uniques too. In my opinion, it\u2019s better than being forced to use a level 12 legendary that is build-enabling because you haven\u2019t found a higher level item which has the aspect you want. \n\nHonestly between closed and open betas and now launch, I\u2019m having a ton of fun. If you\u2019re a fan of the genre you\u2019ll definitely be able to get your money\u2019s worth, and if they manage to put out seasonal content even remotely close to POE\u2019s, I\u2019ll be sticking around for a long time.",

In a scaled dungeon in wow the amount of damage you do is relative to how geared you at your level. It can lead to some wonky scaling but it mostly works when players can be a bunch of different levels",

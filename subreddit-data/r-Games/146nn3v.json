    "postText": "You are suffering from **annoying** **popup ads**, so you decide to hack the people who create and spread those ads and end their evil for good. You download a **Cybertank** that shoots viruses and files, and start hacking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe player can change their projectile's attributes and abilities (Such as inverting its gravity, giving it remote hacking abilities, or make it fly with rage, etc.). Players can mix and match abilities to find the best combination to hack.\n\nDuring the journey, you will deal with other hackers and different kinds of security, including Anti-viruses, Firewalls, Ransomware, Chad viruses and a lot more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Content:**\n\nThe game has an open-ended design, you can use your crafting options and environment to do the job and win in any way you want, even tricking other hackers into destroying each other.\n\nMy focus was on creating a long, handcrafted main campaign, with the goal of providing 20+ hours of content at least, and making cool set pieces that provide cool moments of storytelling.\n\nThe game also has multiple game modes, including a sandbox mode that allows the player to mix powers without limitations in order to make the most insane shots possible, and to compete with others for highscore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRelease date: **November 2023 (PC)**\n\nRelease platforms: **PC, Steam deck, and Switch**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteam Puzzle Fest Trailer:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzn9JNVZXs&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzn9JNVZXs&amp;t=3s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSteam page (Includes Trailer, Gameplay video and a Demo):\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757450/Hackshot/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757450/Hackshot/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",

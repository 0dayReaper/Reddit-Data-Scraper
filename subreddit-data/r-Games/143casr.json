Well, it clearly demonstrates an inheritance from Wine, but it also means that users who are used to the vagaries of Crossover will have a head start on understanding what will and won't work, and the sort of errors that are likely to be encountered (which differ from a hand-rolled Wine install in unique ways).\n\nIt is clear that Codeweavers have quite a bit of experience fine tuning Wine and making a workable product (Crossover for years,  Proton, and now this framework), but it isn't perfect and users shouldn't expect everything to work simply.\n\nNow, any MacOS users who have been looking for wrappers since Wineskin and Cider (Transgaming's closed equivalent) wil understand the sort of magic incantations that are required to get some games to work, as well as just how random some games were in accepting being run in a wrapper.\n\nThe ONE issue I have with how Apple have labelled this particular toolset is that \"Porting Kit\" has been the name of a framework of [customised individual Wineskins](https://www.portingkit.com) that have been fine tuned and managed by people like Paulthetall (a name that should be familiar to anyone who's spent time trying to get apps to work).",

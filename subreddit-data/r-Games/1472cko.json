    "postText": "Hello! I'm Jon, the dev of **WitchHand**, a card-based strategy management game with 4x elements.\n\nWitchHand bullet points!\n\n* manage your villages of witches \n* summon familiars to fight for you \n* fuel your spells with the bones of your enemies\n* trade with foreign powers\n* choose a witch with abilities that suit your playstyle\n* give a frog a sword\n* **Steam page**: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420880/WitchHand/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420880/WitchHand/)\n\nI'm working hard on getting the demo ready for the Steam Nextfest in October, while also trying to build wishlists to have better placement in the fest. This is my third game. I quit my job back in 2021 to work on my games and art full time. I'm doing okay, but I'm hoping that WitchHand finds a bit more success than my previous games. Fingers crossed!\n\nThanks for reading :)",

You\u2019ve picked the worst time to post about it though, the sub will be going dark in an hour or so. \n\nPlus please allow the game to be on GeForce Now, I personally switched to using that on my Mac / console gaming since the library became bearable.",

            "comment": "Looks awesome and original, although I have to wonder why call this a \"Gameplay Trailer\" when there's no gameplay being shown? Has the label became another marketing shenanigan to lure more people into watching a teaser?\n\nIs this an isometric Resident Evil-like survival horror game? Is it a Dead Nation-esque twin stick shooter? Walking simulator? I couldn't get it just from the teaser alone.",

Those customers can't buy games from outside retailers or used games. So Sony makes more money from the all-digital consoles.\n\nSame with Microsoft and their low price on the S.\n\nIf the price difference makes the disc drive version less popular, that's only better for Sony.",

The Coalition's Mike Rayner and Colin Penty showed us a Series X conversion of Gears 5, produced in just two weeks. The developers worked with Epic Games in getting UE4 operating on Series X, then simply upped all of the internal quality presets to the equivalent of PC's ultra, adding improved contact shadows and UE4's brand-new (software-based) ray traced screen-space global illumination. On top of that, Gears 5's cutscenes - running at 30fps on Xbox One X - were upped to a flawless 60fps. We'll be covering more on this soon, **but there was one startling takeaway - we were shown benchmark results that, on this two-week-old, unoptimised port, already deliver very, very similar performance to an RTX 2080.**\n\nThis is currently the only official benchmark of that we have of either of the two consoles as far as I know.",

Also as a second buy for PS gamers who just want to play games like Halo or Gears of War. \n\nAnd for those who seek power they have the Series X and can actually promote it with world\u2018s strongest console as their specs are better than PS5.\n\nI wonder what Sony is going to do. They will most likely price the PS5 DE at 399\u20ac and the disc version at 499\u20ac. But will the DE sell that well for people who might fit in the Series S group?

If it's only an extra $50, you might as well go for the 1TB option instead of the 650GB, right?\n\nI don't really know if the same can be said for consoles, however. The PS5 is a completely different machine and if a consumer is debating between the two platforms, it's likely going to come down to games and what their friends are playing on.",

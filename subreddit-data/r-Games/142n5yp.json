Like 5 minutes in that game and it's clear to see the time and effort spent making it, and GTA 6 will be the same case. What do you think the rest of R* are doing when the GTA online content is being made? Sitting with their thumbs up their arse?",

And don't be so sure reused assets (because the leaks did show GTA 6 using GTA 5 stuff) means things should just work smoothly.",

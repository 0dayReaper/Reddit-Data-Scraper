Doesn't matter how good a game looks if it feels bad to play, and that feel just isn't something you can get from a trailer. I was cautious about Lies of P because sometimes Souslikes just miss the mark (such as the original Lords of the Fallen), but the demo totally cleared my worries about the game.",

Once I got the hang of it I found it to be a nice unique change from the typical soulslike games. \n\nWhat I really loved though was the roguelite mode and I wish Souls games had a similar mode available. I would play Dark Souls 1 way more if I could reexplore the world with random powerups to collect and randomized enemies (even if Mortal Shell didnt have random enemy locations)",

It has a stamina system like Dark Souls, but it seems to want you to parry like Sekiro since the dodge is bad. The parry timing is super tight though, so I never felt like I had any good defensive options. I also feel like the durability mechanic is pointless, since it doesn't add any strategy to the game and only punishes you for forgetting about it.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe they can fix it up prior to release, but as it stands, I don't think I'll be playing it.",

It was incredibly easy to dodge-dodge-dodge to end up directly behind an enemy and attack them while the enemy was still stuck in an attack animation.\n\nLies of P quick step definitely has I frames, just not many. But the biggest issue is that it has long recovery, meaning you can\u2019t spam dodges to avoid rapid attacks, and it covers almost no distance so you can\u2019t simply put space attacks either (well you can, but by sprinting instead of dodging).\n\nI think they need to add one or the other, both would make it too easy. Unspammable dodges would be fine if they moved you far enough that you would weren\u2019t garunteed to get hit by combo attacks even dodging first hit perfectly. And short dodges would work if you could rapidly dodge again, thus perform 4 dodges in a row to avoid a 4-hit combo.",

And defnitely a better souls-like than many other titles.\n\nBut... this year was not very kind to the higher budget releases. Sure, the gameplay looks nice, game itself looks intriguing, but we had so many botched games that it would be foolish to jump on the hype train.",

Honestly it's a bit sad but for me they just lack the spark that you need for a soulslike.\n\nI know they are passionate Devs, they have good ideas, but man I feel they just don't really get how to make good soulslike combat, even after several games. It's improving but I wouldn't even say they got to a level other soulslikes hit first try",

I get that those games too take heavy inspiratipn from Berserk especially but this is borderline silly.

At least the dual-world thing is interesting.",

            "comment": "Interesting highlights:\n\n* Like many suspected, *Redfall* began development when ZeniMax was looking to be acquired, and was encouraging its studios to pivot towards live-service, presumably to increase its value (this also led to the generally panned *Youngblood* and *Fallout 76*)\n* Around 70% of the staff who worked on *Prey* left the company during *Redfall*'s development, at least partially due to disinterest in working on a multiplayer game\n* After the acquisition, some Arkane staff hoped Microsoft would step in and either cancel the game or allow it to be rebooted\n* For a substantial chunk of development, *Redfall* had a cash shop for purchasing cosmetics (as we saw in pre-release leaks), though this was ultimately scrapped\n* Leaders promised that \"Arkane magic\" would manifest at the last minute and save the game during a poor development cycle \u2013\u00a0similar language that BioWare used regarding *Anthem*\n\nUltimately it sounds like there was never really a clear vision for *Redfall*, and it wasn't a game many staff were passionate about. I'm not surprised that it fell apart \u2013\u00a0it seems it never came together in the first place. I think Microsoft needs to find a balance in managing their acquired studios \u2013\u00a0they have swung wildly from overbearing to completely hands-off over the years, when neither approach has been consistently successful.",

Something always goes wrong. Instead of extending the schedule to add more normal work days at the end, producers just tack on more work days during weekends or more hours at the end of work days.\n\nThe only difference between the video game industry and film industry is that thanks to unions, we at least get paid a fuck ton more for our crunch, to the point there's a large percentage of film workers that prefer productions with crunch because of the OT pay.",

Before then you really are kind of running on hopes and prayers. The difference in development between a game that turns out to be amazing after 5 years of frantic development (God of War 2018) and the game that turns out to be garbage (Anthem) probably seems very similar when you're in the weeds. Its not until after release with the benefit of hindsight when you can really understand the  series of choices by management and creative teams that ended up cascading into a failed project.\n\nThe \"magic\" of turning a shit game into a good game in the last 6 months seems to exist in *every game* because all games look terrible before the final push to put all the pieces in place. \n\nAt least thats what it seems like from what I've read.",

                                    "comment": "I do agree this is a major factor and explains why \"X magic\" is observed a lot. \n\nDuring development, especially in large teams, there are simply too many moving pieces and people are silo-ed in hyper-specialized roles. Often it's only towards the end that devs can evaluate and iterate on the full picture, making important adjustments that makes the game \"feel right\" and come together. So creatively at least, it can feel like \"magic\" when all aspects of a game come together. \n\nThe \"magic\" isn't something will always just happen. It's a phenomenon that manifests due to the nature of the craft, but not a guarantee if the work hasn't been done. No amount of small, final tweaks can save a game that has fundamentally broken systems and incoherent creative vision. Or a game that is just too far from done (i.e. needs another year's work). \n\nIn terms of these quotes about leads talking about \"X magic\" kicking in, there's also another layer to consider. I do believe that most game leads understands that the \"X magic\" doesn't just appear out of thin air. \n\nHowever, as mentioned, it's hard to actually know what the state of the game is until late into development. More so if you're the lead - when you're managing hundreds of people, you're basically pretty far removed from the actual work itself, and generally have a very limited knowledge of what the day-to-day status of each components of the game. I.e. you'll hear \"this is going well, things are behind schedule, etc\" Words that don't convey the full meaning when you're not in the thick of things. \n\nSo thinking the game is still coming together for the eventual \"magic phase\" might be understandable, if an overly optimistic prediction. Alternatively, they could know exactly how bad things are, but it could be a morale play - because what's the alternative? \"This game is not coming together, we can't fix this, it's best not to try\".",

Bethesda is autonomous from Xbox studios and does not report to Matt Booty. Bethesda leadership retained control over it's studios only overseen by Satya and Phil. The issue here was with making a single player studio make a multiplayer game out of their expertise, Zenimax not attracting enough talent since devs that wanted to work for Arkane wanted to make immersive sims not live service games, and Xbox not micromanaging Bethesda unlike an Activision would.  \n\n* &gt;Arkane had become known for games called \u201cimmersive sims,\u201d (..) Yet from the start, Redfall was pitched to staff as a \u201cmultiplayer Arkane game,\u201d which some team members said they found confusing. **Developers under Smith and Bare said the two leads were outwardly excited but as the project progressed failed to provide clear direction**. Staff members said that, over time, they grew frustrated with management\u2019s frequently shifting references to other games, such as Far Cry and Borderlands, that left each department with varying ideas of what exactly they were making. **Throughout the development, the fundamental tension between single-player and multiplayer design remained unresolved.**\n\n\n* &gt;Morale at Arkane suffered. Veteran workers who weren\u2019t interested in developing a multiplayer game left in droves. Filling vacancies became a challenge. **Within the industry, ZeniMax had a reputation for paying lower than average salaries**, and convincing some progressive or moderate video game developers to move to Texas could be difficult due to the state\u2019s conservative social policies. **Since Redfall wasn\u2019t yet announced, the studio couldn\u2019t describe its details to prospective employees \u2014 a predicament that exacerbated the staffing issues**, sources familiar with the process said. **Arkane wanted to hire recruits with experience on multiplayer shooters, but the people who applied were by and large looking to work on single-player immersive sims.**\n\n* &gt;Meanwhile, on September 21, 2020, Microsoft purchased ZeniMax for US$7.5 billion. **The acquisition gave some staff at Arkane hope that Microsoft might cancel Redfall or, better yet, let them reboot it as a single-player game, according to sources familiar with the production. Instead, Microsoft maintained a hands-off approach.** Aside from cancelling a version of Redfall that had been planned for rival Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation, **Microsoft allowed ZeniMax to continue operating as it had before, with great autonomy.** \n\n* &gt;Harvey Smith recently said in an interview with the website Eurogamer that \u201cearly on\u201d he pushed back against the compulsory inclusion of an in-game store. **But people who worked on the game said the remarks didn\u2019t square with how things played out. For the first three years, Redfall had a significant microtransaction plan in place. Only in 2021, with \u201cgames as a service\u201d growing more controversial among gamers, did Arkane finally scrap its unwieldy in-game monetization plans.**\n\n\nNotice the live service MTX was scrapped under Xbox ownership not while Zenimax was independent. Pretty much everything negative that happened was attributed to Zenimax forcing live service/multiplayer shenanigans on their single player studios(Fallout 76, Wolfenstein Young Blood etc).",

When it was finished, Austin continued working on post-launch content, while the rest of the studio moved on to Starfield.\n\nMy understanding as well is that those lines are pretty fuzzy too. I'm sure Austin has helped on Starfield and the rest of the studio has helped on 76 post-launch content, but the broad generalization is what I said above.",

Microsoft being hands off with their newly acquired company is seen as a bad thing when that's exactly what people want companies like Activision to be to their studios.\n\nThe reality is that freedom is a double edge sword on the one hand Microsoft not messing with Redfall is seen as bad but I bet you MS not messing with Starfield and ID software will be seen as a good thing.

The devs could fix the bugs, tweak the AI, and balance the combat, but no matter what, the overall game will still be unfinished from a design standpoint.\n\nOverall, it felt like the leadership just gave up once the GaaS trend has passed and decided to just move on.\n\nSo damn disappointing how that studio got screwed over by the leadership, especially when this began with Prey's crap marketing that it failed in profit, so they shifted tacts to GaaS.",

I think its because the games have an inverse difficulty curve: they start with the player being weak and underpowered at the start, and end with them massively overpowered by the end (in Prey, part of the game's design is literally being able to jump over what were once very dangerous combat encounters).  Combine this with players generally not finishing games, and it's a recipe for poor sales.  Deathloop seemingly tries to get around this by making the player a fairly effective fighter at the start, but that apparently wasn't enough to break through.",

Then Ion Storm, who famously made Deus Ex and Thief: Deadly Shadows, made their own series of flops and went to shit, too.\n\nImmersive sims don't pay the bills, it's as simple as that, really. For what reason us fans have speculated for decades.\n\nA go-to reason is often that they're too cerebral so people just don't \"get\" them or want to spend the time to learn but that doesn't sit right with me because 4X/Grand Strategy games are successful despite having one of the largest cliffs in gaming to scale before you even start understanding them let alone \"getting good\". Immersive sims are nothing by comparison.\n\nSo the other reason I've often pitched is just marketing. Marketing has never been great with immersive sims. System Shock, for instance, largely announced itself on its technical aspects and not the survival horror gameplay stuff. System Shock 3 actually had a better trailer by comparison (despite it probably not happening anytime soon) if only because after 20 years of being a cult classic the name \"SHODAN\" is somewhat easy to market off now.\n\nPrey, to look at a modern example, was almost non-existant. The name alone was confusing for some people but that's what good marketing could help with, something Prey never got. Bethesda/ZeniMax never gave it the opportunity. People like me who fucking LOVE Prey and see it as a true successor to System Shock often didn't even know about it until years after release. Like what the fuck?\n\nDeus Ex, for instance, only sold like a million copies after a decade. The sequel actually sold way more likely owing to the console release, so despite it being a blasphemous piece of shit to any true blue Deus Ex fan it still sold better in the long run.\n\nImmersive sims are also just stupidly hard to make if you want them to actually engage the player in any meaningful way. At best we get long-time franchises incorporating pieces of immersive sims rather than full on immersive sims. Hitman and Skyrim, for instance, have traces of emergent gameplay (the hallmark of the genre) and it's likely made easier by the fact they long-standing franchises that had time to build up to that and they don't rely on emergent storytelling as much by comparison. Hitman's story doesn't really change whether I shoot the target in the head or kill them with a homing suitcase, for instance.",

Glad I got into an Arkane game as Dishonored didn't do it for me.\n\nPlayed my first run on the hardest difficulty and it 100% adds to it especially up against certain larger enemies, in particular the *large* one, as you feel like you're really in the deep end. It's a game where you get so much more context of the plot and world by reading the emails, listening to the logs, exploring the various parts of the station and figuring out the puzzles. It's got action, some quiet moments and moments where you'll really be caught off guard and need to think and act fast.\n\nI recently moved to PC from Xbox and am itching to play it again now!",

Instead, Microsoft maintained a hands-off approach.\n\nThat's an interesting tid-bit, because somebody from Xbox (I forget who) was out there a couple of years ago talking up their hands-off approach and not meddling in development.\n\n[Tim Schafer has been on the record talking about this positively:](https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/double-fine-microsoft-limited-integration-tim-schafer/)\n\n&gt;I made a joke about how we were going to work on Excel and stuff, but it\u2019s the opposite. They want us for what we were already doing. They knew what we\u2019re doing. They knew the games that we released, and they\u2019re like \u2018yeah, come and do that for Xbox.\u2019\n\nIf you're Xbox, it seems like a no-brainer to look at Arkane the same way: yeah, we love your stuff, keep doing what you're doing, pretend we're not here.\n\nObviously, that approach didn't pay off quite the same way it did with Double Fine. What I'm interested to learn is how there was such a disconnect--did Microsoft leave all of the ZeniMax management in place as-is? Was there no way to go around them and get ahold of Microsoft and say \"hey we're on a bad path here\"? Why even bother retaining ZeniMax management, assuming that was the case?\n\nThese sorts of problems where your employees are on the front-line of an impending disaster whose warnings are muted by people in the middle are a relatively common type of horror story in software development and it's something I think about a lot as a senior (non-gaming) developer.",

All their previous acquisitions were relatively small studios that already had a great culture within it (Double Fine, Obsidian, Inxile, Ninja Theory) and they thrived under them, with the case with Zenimax however, Microsoft probably thought they could just do what they did before but its definitely now clear that that was the wrong approach to take.",

But they lost 70% of the ground level devs. \n\nSimilar things happened with BioWare throughout the Anthem and Dragon Age Joplin years. BioWare execs move to multiplayer games and BioWare\u2019s star writers and devs fled as it was the end of BW\u2019s RPG era. \n\nThey even cancelled DA Joplin so they could make a live service Dragon Age (which was eventually scrapped a couple years back). \n\nWhen these company execs make decisions to entirely change a dev teams culture and skill set it can have major effects on the team like you point out. \n\nNow BioWare and Arkane are going to have to rehire or relearn all the lessons they lost through all of that attrition during the 2015-2020 period where their execs abandoned the knowledge and skills they had for a quick buck.",

After Prey flopping, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s crazy that the executives pushed for the studio to increase their revenue and make a profitable hit, as it doesn\u2019t make any financial sense to keep funding a studio that isn\u2019t really pulling its weight.  \n  \nThe biggest issue with Redfall, it seems, is that there was just no actual vision for the game and that the concept of a live service multiplayer game by the studio is just straight up antithetical to the studio itself. The lack of vision may have stemmed from the studio being forced to create a game that was entirely outside of their wheelhouse, but a proper vision could\u2019ve atleast maybe created a game with some decent bones. Redfall kind of fails on every aspect as an Arkane Austin game, as a multiplayer game, and as a live service game.",

So nobody who played the game knew when the next good thing was coming exactly. \n\nSuicide Squad is going to deliver the content the same way and it will fail.

When the reality seemed to be the opposite. Arkane heads decided to do it themselves, &amp; then they ran into development problems that they were clueless about. Kind of like Bethesda on Fallout 76.   \n&gt;Developers under Smith and Bare said the two leads were outwardly excited but as the project progressed failed to provide clear direction. Staff members said that, over time, they grew frustrated with management\u2019s frequently shifting references to other games, such as Far Cry and Borderlands, that left each department with varying ideas of what exactly they were making.\n\nThis was the real issue.

Corporations right now are using the guise of LGBT rights for example to gain support but it's entirely shallow, they don't actually give a damn. If it was suddenly the majority opinion that LGBT people shouldn't have rights then all these companies giving their \"support\" would switch without a second thought. This kind of fake \"wokeness\" tends to work as well, I'm a lefty so I'm saying this from a leftist point of view but liberals who tend to only view things through the lens of identity without also including class analysis are incredibly easy to dupe with this. It happens all the time and this is just another example.",

Corporations will try to play both conservative and \"Progressive\" camps because it's profitable, they'll do the same for political issues like freedom of expression, \"we fully support freedom of the press and expression ^^unless ^^it's ^^about ^^HK ^^because ^^we ^^like ^^Chinese ^^money\".\n\nThis goes for anything else, Chechnya if the corporation is heavily involved in Russia, actual functional change regarding the military industrial complex in the US, anything that could negatively effect their bottom line must be avoided.

But this is outright betrayal, masquerading as dismissal for 'offending the public'.

This is distinctly and undeniably a political move that infringes on the freedom of the tournament's participants. They are literally enforcing censorship for a country with known egregious human ethical violations, for no demonstrable reason other than pandering.

Blizzard deserves no tolerance from anyone.\n\nAlso here's a useful link: https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/wf/services/1327/1361 I have a WoW account with hundreds of hours played.

                                    "comment": "*EDIT: By request, I've added a few links if you're interested in learning more!*\n\nChina is actually one of the few aspects of our geopolitical future that I don't personally think will *inevitably* end in disaster.  It could, of course, and there will probably be plenty of damage done along the way, but not all signs point to China's continued rise.  I'm not on my civics account right now, so I apologize for the relative lack of bookmarked sources, but here's a very basic rundown:\n\n* BRI isn't all it's cracked up to be.  It's plagued by corruption and mismanagement by local partner governments, most of which are... less than stable.  Even at home, their major infrastructure decisions are not actually being centrally planned.  Every so often, you'll see something like two major ports being built right next to each other - because two neighboring minor provinces both want the investment, and the national government is mostly just rubber-stamping plans originating at the local level, even if it makes no sense at the national level to do so.  (Further reading: [The Utterly Dysfunctional Belt and Road.](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-utterly-dysfunctional-belt-and-road.html) Scholar's Stage is a _fantastic_ source of Chinese analysis, and for my money this is probably the best piece ever compiled on BRI and what it tells us about the structure of Chinese government. If you read nothing else I've linked, read this one. It's long, but it's worth every second of its time).\n\n* Chinese growth investment (including but not limited to BRI) is essentially driven by massive, blatant, systematic financial fraud. The oligopoly has been driving investment largely by creating new debt instruments out of other debt instruments, shuffling debt between institutions to conceal the true total volume of debt, siphoning off large profits without regard to anyone's ability to repay, etc.  If that sounds familiar, it should - it's basically the equivalent of the mortgage-backed CDOs that caused the '07-08 financial crisis in the West.  How long they can keep this up is anyone's guess, but it can't last forever.  Don't be surprised if China suffers a *profound* economic crash at some point in the next several years.  (Further reading: I will again lean on Scholar's Stage here to provide [a series of highlights from the book Red Capitalism](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2014/08/passages-i-highlighted-in-my-copy-of.html). I also found [this lengthy and detailed explainer](http://www.cadtm.org/An-Overview-of-Chinese-Debt), but you'll probably need some university-level macroeconomics background - or at least a solid understanding of the forces behind the '07-08 financial crisis - to really get the most out of that one).\n\n* The Western powers that be are slowly but surely coming around to the idea that China needs to be punished for its continued economic and human rights misconduct.  Media is paying a lot of attention, businesses are starting to diversify production (mostly into other areas of the Asian subcontinent), and the political establishment is rumbling about countermeasures.  (Further reading: Large ranges of manufacturers [branching out, mostly into SE Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade-war/China-scrambles-to-stem-manufacturing-exodus-as-50-companies-leave); [Pentagon creates a new office solely focused on China](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2019/10/01/the-pentagon-has-created-a-new-office-solely-focused-on-china-is-that-a-good-idea/))\n\n* We finally have two leading US Presidential candidates (Warren and Sanders) who understand that global trade isn't a universal positive, and who actually have half-decent strategies to ensure that our political goals are brought into consideration when determining our international trade relationships. (Further reading: [Warren's trade plan](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/29/8933825/elizabeth-warren-trade-economic-patriotism))\n\nSo yeah.  Things suck right now, especially for HKers, and we should still be doing everything in our power to fight for freedom at home and abroad.  But it's not all doom and gloom.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve just never understood why games insist upon increasing the amount of content but not the depth/complexity. We\u2019ve come so far in technology but it seems like games insist on increasing the graphics, the world size, the amount of pointless quests and check off the boxes content.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 feels like the perfect example. They clearly wanted to create a deep game. With complex role playing and player choice. Realistic systems. The ability to handle problems anyway you want. A modern day immersive sim. That\u2019s how the trailers felt and I think that\u2019s what created so much hype imo. It was going to be GTA but endlessly replayable with a fully realized world.\n\nBut instead, they focused on the graphics. Keanu Reeves. A big world with multiple locales. Flashy effects. \n\nI love the idea of games like Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld. Trying to fully realize AI. Wasn\u2019t that the dream of games? To fully create any world where you could do what you wanted? But even Skyrim decided to do away with Oblivion\u2019s realistic NPC schedules. One of my favorite things was to follow NPC\u2019s or watch their interactions, memeable as they were.\n\nI would love a game that had no voice acting, covered maybe a few city blocks, and the graphics were just decent enough to understand what was around you. Instead a AAA budget was spent on the complex systems of the AI. All the choices you could make. All the ways you could interact with the world. Realistically affecting people\u2019s lives and watching how those effects cascade. So many ways to approach situations. Endlessly replayable. A fantasy universe. \n\nI feel like this was the dream of the Elder Scrolls but they decided to focus on bombast instead. Starfield seems much the same. Hitman is about the closest example of what I\u2019m talking about I can think of.\n\nCan we not improve AI? Is this not marketable? Can we not have Half-Life: Alyx in a GTA world? Am I the only one who wants this?",

Now suppose that mediocre designer has to create a skill tree and add a talent/node that breaks 25 out of those 50 encounters, suddenly you have a lot of work to re-do (unless you drop the node).\n\nMultiply this conundrum for every aspect of a modern game and you got you answer.",

Especially because it sounds like you want a whole game of this type of content.\n\nIn Hitman, it's the kinda thing that makes it the whole focus of the game. Same with Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress. But in every other type of game, it's just not important. If anything the whole schedule thing can be annoying because that means you've gotta look for the NPCs, see Stardew Valley. \n\nWhen you described what you wanted, there still has to be a (fun) game in there. Hell you could almost be describing The Sims. Shadows of Doubt might also be kinda game you're looking for? That game looks pretty interesting",

Especially DF because, while it has Z levels now, the game started off so much simpler but just kept adding in more and more and more. Admittedly it\u2019s a messy game but it\u2019s also a testament to how much you can build on a solid foundation.\n\nTo respond more to the OP\u2026 it\u2019s to cast a wider net. A lot of company higher ups still think GTA3 is the new hot thing and we are still wow\u2019d by being allowed to go into copy and paste indoor locations. The more you add, the more likely you\u2019ll get different peoples interests included.",

It's just that graphics are a lot easier to achieve and complex mechanics are a lot easier to break (-&gt; harder to test/balance). Big simple worlds and good graphics \"just work\", adding another map/level or implementing ray tracing is relatively easy, and in theory the changes could be altered later in the development. But reworking physics or AI can change (and break) the whole game. Imagine discovering that some systems in your game are not fun to play with, but you can't change them because other system heavily depend on them.",

They don't promise much, but their games keep amazing players with the \"Wait, that's possible?!\" kind of feeling. I do think that Tears of The Kingdom has the most well-thought-out gameplay mechanics I've ever seen.

Like any of the Mario sports games that keep releasing, they have basically no content and the online feels barely playable. Advance Wars, while I love the game, did not even have matchmaking. At least to me, it feels like Nintendo drops the ball with most of its games, but then picks up the slack on its really huge releases, like Zelda.",

Stuff like Cars not having AI, pedestrians being largely non interactive, and the Police systems are all compromises that are understandable to make when the game isn't trying to be a super wide everything game but caught flack because that's what people expected.",

            "comment": "Honestly this is a common problem across a lot of media.  The truth is that simpler is something that can appeal to more people, resulting in greater revenue.  It's interesting to me because I remember a lot of the complex games when PCs were first starting out, and often times getting a game to even run required making changes to your DOS configuration files, and maybe buying some additional memory.  The audience was self-selected to a much higher intellectual level, and the games reflected this.  As gaming has become main stream, and the requirements are often to just be able to put in a cartridge and press a button the systems in the games themselves have often become much simpler.  \n\nThat having been said, it's also been interesting watching the increasing complexity of the control systems as joysticks have gone from one stick and 1-2 buttons, to the twin stick, 13-15 button monsters, with multiple combined button presses required as a matter of course.\n\nThat having been said, it's always sorta been an issue.  Doom and Wolfenstein 3d ushered in the 3d FPS shooter, but nobody remembers Ultima Underworld a far more complex game that actually pioneered all of the concepts that made John Carmack a household name.  However, while Doom featured a very simple premise: move forward, shoot everything, UU featured puzzles, roleplaying, a magic system, and an over arching plot involving dozens of NPCs.",

Stuff like Rimworld will just get a \"WTF is this\" reaction from the casual audience and generate no interest. Despite being an incredible experience that will hook you in for hundreds of hours.\n\nTake that Star Wars trailer from yesterday for example. People who frequent reddit and stuff are a lot more in the know with this stuff, so the reaction is going to be, \"That looks nice, but its probably another Ubisoft shallow open world checklist game\". But people who are not thinking about and researching video games all the time(which makes up a lot higher % of the audience) will see it and just be excited for a very nice looking Star Wars game. Its why stuff like Madden and FIFA despite incurring major complaints year after year after year keep showing up on the top selling lists. The casual audience is more interested in shiny graphics and celebrities than actual depth and compelling experiences.\n\nYou and I know how amazing Rimworld is. But try showing a 5 minute gameplay slice to someone who only cares about shiny graphics and celebrity voice acting. They will lose interest before we even get to minute 1. Its just reality. And the AAA companies are more concerned about what will increase their share price a lot more than actually producing a compelling product. They could spend resources on creating a deep experience that few people will appreciate. Or spend the money on shiny graphics and hiring a Hollywood guy to voice lines cause that will get a lot more people engaged and pre-ordering. Once the game is out, who cares if people like it or not. They got the sales and their share prices went up and they can report that to the investors. That's all that matters.",

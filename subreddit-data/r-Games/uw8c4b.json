Right before the Christmas holidays.  The same year shareholders voted that Bobby Kotick should be able to give himself a $155 million dollar pay package.\n\nFucking.  Get.  Them.",

Only to work in a dehumanizing environment and get fired at the first sign of a complaint. Yeah, this industry definitely needs unions.",

They get falsely sold on the idea that taking a job as a tester is a way to get their \"foot in the door.\" While people are sometimes hired as software devs or designers out of QA roles, it's relatively rare, and it gives management something to hold over their heads. \"If you ever want to make it to an actual dev job, you have to put up with this/put in your time/go 'above and beyond.'\"\n\nPeople will put up with a lot that they otherwise wouldn't when they believe it's a path to their dream job, and companies take advantage of that.\n\nAs a non-games dev, a random piece of advice to recent grads: If you have the background necessary to get a full software dev role (i.e., CS or CE degree), and that's what you want, don't get fooled by recruiters trying to trick you into accepting a QA or support role. This happens in and out of games. Just hold out for a real dev position. I'm not trying to demean QA/support jobs -- they're extremely important. But if a QA/support job isn't what you want, don't let yourself get tricked into taking one out of thinking it's a stepping stone. You'll find the job miserable and you'll be missing out on years of very valuable experience, and potentially letting yourself get pigeonholed.",

It's way more profitable to play it safe. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'd love to see a studio invest an absolute buttload of money into the \"perfect\" game, just for the sake of making the greatest game ever made even if it bankrupts them. But these are publicly traded companies, their primary objective before all else is to maximize profits.",

This is a challenging assignment and expands the complexity of the feature. For example, what happens to the sheets if the AI needs to exit the bed in an emergency?\n\nSo no, they didn't \"form a team\", and no, this isn't \"a new feature\".

Cyberpunk2077 took 6-7 years and look how that turned out.\n\nYou're also completely missing the facts that when Star Citizen development started, there was no established team experienced with their engine/processes/pipelines. They didn't even have an office.\n\nYou're also really missing the context of the conversation, which is that *literally the entire point of Star Citizen is to just sake fuck it and throw all the cash at making the biggest most grandiose thing you possibly can*. Fucking *of course* it's taking longer. Do you really think it's possible to turn out \"the greatest game ever made even if it bankrupts them\" (y'know, that thing I replied to?) in the same amount of time it takes to make an average AAA game?",

Even then, going by your timeline, they took *at most* 8 years for delivery, while SC is going on 11 years with no signs it'll launch within the next 5 years or so.\n\n&gt;Starfield is taking how long now?\n\n7 years? 2018 was when it left pre-production, but I dunno what pre-production at Bethesda looks like. Still a faster timeline than SC.\n\n&gt;Cyberpunk2077 took 6-7 years and look how that turned out.\n\nCyberpunk was trash for reasons beyond being rushed and didn't start dev until 2016.",

                    "comment": "Hi. I worked with a union most of my adult career and continue to do so. In fact, I ended up having to walk through a strike line (because I'm a salary manager) several years back since part of our operation walked out. Our business merged with another, and both sides came to an impasse.\n\nPoint being...\nNow that the union has been officially created, the next major move is on the union, not ATVI.\n\n**The union has several choices:**\n\n\nThey can do nothing at this moment and continue to just keep working as is. They can deal with a contract later. If they do this, they are still a union, but they don't have a binding contract with the company. It's basically business as usual, but the company has to work with the union (not individual members) for staffing, firing, etc. \n\nOR\n\nThey can state that they demand a contract and both parties (ATVI &amp; the union) must show up at the bargaining table and act in a manner we generally call \"good faith.\" They cannot strike until the \"good faith\" process has failed. ATVI cannot just walk away either, claiming they don't want to be there. Neither party can just walk away, at least initially.  During this time, they are required to keep attending work, in good faith, as the contract is being negotiated. If, after some determined about of time (weeks or months), no contract has been negotiated, the union can strike, OR the company can willingly lock them out.\n\n\n\n\n**OK. So what happens when they meet?**\n\n1. If they reach an agreement with ATVI, both parties sign and must abide by the contract. The contract will apply to anyone who joins that SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL group of employees. It does not apply to everyone at the site or office (or employer). Even in non right-to-work states, the contract cannot apply to anyone that isn't in the defined union band. This reason why people get swept up into unions they didn't even know existed is because their role falls into the defined employment coverage. \n\nOR\n\n1. If ATVI and the union cannot agree on a contract, and IF they don't call in a federal mediator (which is an option), the union can strike. If the union strikes, they cannot attend work and begin striking. At that stage, its anyone's guess how to move forward, but it can involve weeks, or months, of back &amp; forth negotiations to end the strike. ATVI can also lock them out. If the union cannot come to terms with ATVI, and ATVI declares the good faith process is over, they can choose to lock them out. This is effectively forcing a strike, which begins the strike process, perhaps involuntarily. Locking employees out is rare, but it does occur from time to time.\n\n**Finally,**\n\n\nWhile it is extremely rare, if the two sides cannot end the strike, they can agree to move to the court system where federal authorities will meet with both sides and rule on a legally binding contract. This is generally not desired by either party.\n\n**Are there nuclear options that ATVI could use to \"nuke\" this union and end the entire process?**\n\nYes, but most of them are relatively risky, or might run afoul of the NLRB. ATVI could claim a downturn in economics and create layoffs. There isn't much a union can do if the parent company says \"we can't afford XYZ\" and starts laying off staff. That said, if they do that, they would have the first rights to come back if ATVI needed to hire QA (usually, this is a complicated process). ATVI could close Raven, move everyone except the QA testers to a different business unit, though that seems unlikely just to deal with a small QA union. Both of these actions would likely get held up in the courts for months. We also have to consider that there is a significant possibility that this will be Microsoft's responsibility in a year. ATVI may just push this out, or sign some contract, knowing that MSFT has to take over. At this stage, if you're a high level leader in ATVI, why \"fight\" this when it's likely MSFT will have to deal with it soon. (Again, likely. We don't know 100% if the deal will clear.)\n\n\n**A few final thoughts on this:**\n\nThe union also has to create their own by-laws. They can do this at any time (sooner rather than later). Now that they are a union, they have to determine how they will operate themselves (take union dues, determine seniority, controller positions, voting, meetings, etc.).\n\nA union in this sector of the industry has been rumbling for quite some time, especially with this group often being the lowest paid and most \"replaceable\" employees. (That's not an insult, it's how the job market &amp; employers often function in regards to QA employees.)\nDoes this \"spark\" of unionization create a foundation for other QA employees to generate their own unions?\nYes and no, but mostly...no.\nIt is true that this unionization effort could push other similarly structured QA teams to unionize, but the push here was a very specific set of circumstances that drove this group to do so. It's difficult to replicate the same \"energy\" among employees in different situations, even other QA testers at other employers. And of course, it should be mentioned that some people simply don't want to unionize for whatever the reason may be. QA teams are further being embedded into staff positions, and there's been a lot of consolidation as of late (bringing QA in-house, making it a deeper part of the process). As studios further push to create staff based QA positions, where people feel like more \"in the process\" (and likely paid better) there will be less energy to unionize. We should not expect this QA union to suddenly cause mid-to-high salary engineers, designers, and other staff to suddenly want a union either. It is incredibly difficult to unionize white collar, professional employees. The fact that a union was formed here should be admired, but I'd be careful with applying this to other employers.\n\nCould it happen again, especially with another QA team? Yes. It's is slightly more likely now? Yes, possibly. Should we expect many of them? No.",

If it's taken into account from the start of the dev period then it isn't too hard to code the in-house engine to allow for relatively easy refactoring/code the game to allow for relatively easy updates to newer versions of UE/Unity/whatever other engine in the future, similar to how porting is a helluva lot easier if the game is built to be portable from the get-go even if initially it's only on one platform.\n\nSims 3 is *really* bad for it: It isn't too bad if you just install a couple of EPs (Especially leaving out the last two which have a fair few bugs) but if you've got everything and a bunch of store content installed then the game barely runs at all without a bunch of modding and tweaking. Even then it's still limited because it's a 32bit process and really needs more memory than even LAA can give it.",

The problem isn't the engine necessarily, but more that they've absolutely bloated the game with piles and piles of mechanics that at *best* barely interact with each other, if they do at all. There's a mess of meters, scaling numbers, country or culture specific mechanics, and other such stuff that just confuses everything and contributes to a feeling of bloat.\n\nThe reason this has happened is that people hate it when DLC feel essential, and there are a few for EU4 that are unfortunately pretty essential (most infamously Common Sense and Art of War), but to avoid any specific DLC being essential like that, you basically have to make each one a separate, siloed off section that doesn't interact with anything else. However, EU4 has had more DLC than any other Paradox game, including CK2, so it suffers from that bloat more than anything else.",

E.g.\n\n&gt; [**How DISH TV denied employees\u2019 right to collective bargaining even after they won their union election**](https://www.epi.org/publication/fear-at-work-how-employers-scare-workers-out-of-unionizing/)\n&gt; \n&gt; **In 2009,** 100 technicians and warehouse workers in two Dallas-area branches of the DISH TV corporation decided to organize a union. **They affiliated with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), won their election, and had their union certified by the NLRB. But a decade later, they still have no contract.** The employer\u2014relying in part on advice from the anti-union Jackson Lewis law firm\u2014engaged in a series of tactics including legal delays, management intimidation, and economic retaliation. Some of these acts were legal and some were not; together, **they illustrate how the weakness of current labor law allows employers to effectively block workers\u2019 right to collective bargaining even after they have won an election.**",

This is an argument within the labor movement known as craft vs. industrial unionism. \n\nCraft unionism has multiple unions scattered throughout several workplaces accounting for the various different *crafts* being practiced, e.g., all the electricians get together and unionize. Traditionally, craft unionism is considered less radical and more conservative, but it's easier to get into place because you need fewer people on board and they're all people doing the same thing. It's a foot in the door.\n\nIndustrial unionism is traditionally considered more radical, and tends to attract political radicals (socialists and communists and the like). Instead of each type of job being unionized on the basis of type, you unionize entire workplaces or industries in bigass unions who will all go on strike if you fuck with one of them. It's harder to get in place because you have to unify people who may never talk to each other and whose jobs have little directly in common (e.g., electricians and truckers), but once in place it allows you to really flex your muscle.\n\nTraditionally, construction trades follow more of a craft union model, and mass production (e.g., automotive manufacturing) follows more of an industrial union model.",

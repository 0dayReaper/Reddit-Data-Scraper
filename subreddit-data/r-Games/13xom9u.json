Really big fan of Cooking Companions and have been since the demo - just backed the Kickstarter and I'm really looking forward to Dread Weight and seeing how the world expands! A couple questions, if that's okay -\n\n1) Without giving too much away, what are you most excited for us to see in Dread Weight?\n\n2) If Mariah, Anatoly, Gregor and Karin had all lived and escaped, what would they be doing now?\n\nThanks for your time!",

People cheered for Jason Voorhees for example even though he's the villain. Since you play for the Baba Yaga in these games, do you see a similar thing happening in Cooking Companions?\nWould you consider Cooking Companions Reverse horror?",

If you look at the first fanart of the game, most people were drawing the MC as a creepy guy...That's why I included gender neutral pronouns in the original: it worked, but it definitely upset some players with the twist ending.\n\nWould I consider Cooking Companions reverse horror? Maybe. There were people cheering on Baba Yaga when she finally dealt with Karin, but afterwards I think most people \"got\" what I was going for: to pity and despise this villain.",

Characters trying to do the right thing but  \nultimately unable to change/fix everything has always appealed to me in fiction, because it\u2019s more realistic and true to how history plays out.  \nI picked Eastern European folklore because it\u2019s global, but also  \nbecause certain figures have evolved over time.   \nI picked real world history because there is SO MUCH incredible history in the last 100 years that is largely forgotten. Making it part of the mystery is something I hope to include in all of my games!",

I see theres a much bigger crew with a lot more work done for Dread Weight, so how did the development for this game compare to when you made Cooking Companions? Was it easier since you already made the first game, or wildly different due to bigger Dreams for this newer game?",

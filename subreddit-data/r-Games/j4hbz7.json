I've heard it from others, so I don't mean it's on you.\n\nYou can't fight popular games through storage size, because the moment a new shiney game comes, players are more likely to uninstall your game to try the new game.\n\nThe most valuable resource in GaaS is player *time*. Players either invest time to grind, or pay money to skip it. They also need to divide their time between games they like... and usually between genres (i.e. people tend to pick one MOBA, or MMO. It's less likely someone plays Warzone and Fortnite in equal amounts).\n\nThe idea of GaaS is to keep you coming for more. You have Warzone fatigue? Look at that shiney new Season 6 patch with added zones, weapons, etc. If they risked an uninstall of a huge game, they risk players not trying it out. It's far more convenient to have a game you have ready to go.\n\nLast but not least: the most popular games tend to be accesible. The more you increase requirements, the less people play it. CoD's massive size was offset by its loyal playerbase, but it was a big enough critique that PS4 players can indeed split their storage.\n\nAll in all, it's more likely they decided to not optimize their game, and went for high quality non-repeating texture across the board. That added everything up and they just shipped it.",

It obvious we are getting to the point where SSD usage is increasing and is going to spike come the next generation of consoles, so the option to be able to download a trimmed down version to make better use of a more expensive storage medium would be great. I do not know what would be required from the dev team to make this happen, since I do not know if the copying of assets is done explicitly or automatically by the tools (I would guess the latter).",

The game just has a bunch of high resolution unique materials that each require multiple high res textures to make. \n\nLots of people say \"Just compress the textures\" and don't realize that when you compress textures that means you need to have more system ram to decompress those textures into while the game runs.\n\nIn general on consoles ram budget is far tighter than storage space, so it's pretty obvious why the choice is to go with uncompressed assets vs. compressed.",

Sometimes there's a balance to be found, sometimes you need to pick one or the other, etc.\n\nAnd of course the more complex the task, the harder it is to optimize, and it's not like you ever know for sure that something is as optimized as it can be, so you need to kind of pick a point where you call it good enough so you don't spend all your resources chasing diminishing returns.",

On a magnetic HDD, when a file is retrieved generally 2/3rds of time is spent seeking (finding the file) 1/3rd on retrieval. \n\nSo the way you combat this is that when assets are being loaded on a disk they're stored sequentially so the HDD spends less time finding the files when it has to load them.\n\nSo now if your game has lots of maps. To decrease load time, you have to store every single asset that loads in that map next to each other on the disk. If multiple maps share the same asset (e.g. texture of a wall), you duplicate that asset so the HDD doesn't have to search all across the disk to find it. Do this enough times with enough high quality assets, and you get COD:MW.\n\nThis is something that's solved by modern SSDs. Since SSDs have no seek time, this trick doesn't need to be done. But unless you can guarantee the people running your game are all using SSDs (PS5, Xbox series X) then you have to make your game packed with assets to accommodate the people still using magnetic hard drives to play their games.\n\nCurrently this is one of the largest bottle necks in video game production and one that can be solved on consoles but not in PC Gaming.",

For this statement to be true, the file would need to be 500Kb in size, any bigger and it would no longer be true. Most files are much bigger than that, and most drive are usually faster than that.\n\nI don't know why this piece of information keeps getting repeated, this is only true for disc reads (CD/DVD/Bluray), on hard drives **the developer does not control where the file is physically on the drive**, even a single file can be in several places on the hard drive. NTFS has a default block size of 4Kb, which means that the files are split in 4Kb pieces, these piece can be anywhere on the disk, and pieces from the same file are not guaranteed to be next to each other, the developer does not control this, you need low level tools that handle raw data to achieve this, which I do not trust any game developer with, any bugs and it could corrupt all data on your drive. If you have free space, windows is good enough to keep things defragmented, so it shouldn't be a problem anyway.",

Even a moment's thought shows how silly the idea is, but people keep repeating it like it's truth. Like you said, the developer has zero control over where on your hard drive stuff gets loaded. If there's any truth to the idea that it's related to optimization, then it would be a holdover from the days *the game had to be loaded from disc.* How long has it been since those days? For many years now the disc has essentially been nothing but a physical DRM key to unlock the download/allow the game to run.\n\nThis sort of technique would only be of benefit when games had to be actively loaded from CD/DVD-ROM every time you played them.\n\nThere is no way that's the issue. I find it far more likely that they simply develop in a way that is not considerate of the user's storage space. Think of all the cosmetics -- skins, etc. At ultra high texture resolutions, those take up an enormous amount of space. Apparently the production director at Infinity Ward said it's so big because \"it's just a ton of content.\" Sorry, but if RDR2 can fit on my machine in about 100 gigs, there is zero reason for COD to take so much goddamn space.",

I enjoy playing the game, but these days the size it takes up (which in turn prevents me from installing other games) and my frustration towards WZ coming to a head are leading me to just put it to rest for a while. Honestly the way Activision is handling this series is pretty counter intuitive IMO.\n\nNever understood why they don't just turn COD into a base framework, unify all of their teams, and iterate on that over the entirety of next gen akin to something like Fortnite being one ever evolving thing. The MW engine is good enough looking to where I think most would be satisfied with the games looking like that for some time. Idk I guess I just imagine a yearly sub where they basically have a \"greatest hits\" of call of duty and stop shoving out yearly iterations of the game that often don't keep evolving certain gameplay mechanics. Something like COD Mobile but way more polished. \n\nI was satisfied with Modern Warfare because it delivered a modern version of the glory days of the franchise. The new Black Ops Cold War now feels tired and like they are attempting to resell their \"history\" back to us. But the Cold War alpha felt like many steps backwards from MW rather than a true iteration on what many like (no mounting, no doors, no night time, no double sprint, gimped movement system, overall polish looking a bit rougher than MW).\n\nBut these games are chart toppers every year so idk what I'm talking about. Obviously what they're doing now works wonders. Just can't help but envision the series in a light where it isn't being spread across different \"versions\" every year.",

Wasn't the entire point of pre-rendered videos that you can have prettier cutscenes than the console allows?\n\nPre-rendering in-engine cutscenes has literally no benefits whatsoever, you get in-game graphics with compression artifacts and yet it still takes up way more storage space than just running the whole cutscene entirely in-game.",

Yes, the file size is huge, but it's not like it's running with no compressed files. I'd bet literally every asset is compressed in some way. Some optimizations for performance can make for a bigger file size as well.\n\nPre-rendered cutscenes do have benefits from a dev perspective. They can do much more at a consistent frame rate and everyone no matter the platform gets the same quality regardless of visual settings.",

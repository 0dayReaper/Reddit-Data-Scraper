Throughout the game you control kane of raziel and then there's a boss fight where you fight each other.

They removed it once, but it found Pete again and bonded to him. Eventually he managed to get it off with the infamous church bell scene we all know. Something to note is that the process almost killed Peter and the symbiote actually saved his life before accepting that Peter rejected it and leaving. Afterward is where it binds with Brock and the whole Venom thing starts. \n\nIt\u2019s a mix bag because while I like how the animated series handled it, I also really like the idea that the symbiote was conscious genuinely cared about Peter\u2019s well-being",

This is my mad face!\" Oh no, Peter unleashed his inner... angsty junior high school student. I'm sure he's going to say something rude to Miles and maybe hurt someone more than he should (but not so much as to be unforgivable.) Peter kind of being a dickhead is not, to me, a \"darker tone.\" So far, from the preview, it's more amusing than anything. The perennial friendly neighborhood hero is being kind of mean for a little while until he stops. I'm not exactly scared for what dark places we might go.",

The game is, at some level, a period piece-- no character in 2018 had that kind of dialogue, and no other character in Ragnarok does either. It is a choice that some may find grating to the character and to the world.\n\nBut those same people don't know how to phrase that criticism. They just know it feels wrong-- so yes, then they point to the thing they hear all the time, that the writing is bad, that it's millennial writing, etc. That doesn't mean they didn't have a legitimate grievance-- criticism does not come from the ether. It just means they are poor at articulating what that grievance is.",

In the trailer for Spider-Man 2, some rando mercenary/terrorist group was flying around NYC in armed VTOL aircraft with reckless abandon and encountering absolutely no resistance from any government force. If they decided to fly a few hundred meters higher, Spider-Man would be completely impotent against them. Just bomb Mayor Osbourne's house when he's asleep or something. Keep it simple.\n\nThese stories only work because absolutely every character is holding the [idiot ball](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) 90% of the time.",

The Electro/Vulture fight was absolutely amazing, and so was the Scorpion hallucination section but those were about the best thing to come from that B Plot. Spiderman 2 seems like it's focusing mostly on a smaller set of villains, which I think is smarter.\n\nMiles Morales basically only focused on The Tinkerer and it was a way smaller scale story that played way more into family dynamics and story and I think it was way stronger for it.",

But this is a superhero marvel game. It is what it is.",

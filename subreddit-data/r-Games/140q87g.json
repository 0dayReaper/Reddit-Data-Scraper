    "postText": "Outer Space Shack is a gripping space base building game where players strive to master the cosmos and establish sustainable habitats. In this update, we delve into thrilling enhancements in the game like our advanced life support system, the return of the lunar rover, and the initial stages of In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Plus, we've integrated numerous quality of life improvements to boost your gaming experience. Stay tuned for the latest game insights on our subreddit ( r/outerspaceshack). You may enjoy the [latest video screenshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/OuterSpaceShack/comments/13qxy93/astronauts_in_outer_space_shack_are_busy_on_the/) or the [trailer on the Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620870/Outer_Space_Shack/).\n\n**High Performance life support**\n\n\rOver the past few months, I've introduced basic thermal and air management systems into Outer Space Shack. Early in the game, players can access this system, but it comes with certain drawbacks. It requires a piece of machinery per space base module, taking up considerable space inside. Additionally, CO2 scrubbing requires consumable supplies. Plus, cooling, a primary challenge on the Moon, demands substantial thermal radiators.\n\n([screenshot here](https://mcusercontent.com/bb34f60bf800f96dd552301fa/images/de950164-cdc4-684a-5b14-7370b4f6f596.jpg))\n\nI'm excited to share that the high-performance life support system is a significant upgrade. A large heat pump now assures heating and cooling. The renewable life support mechanism I've designed includes a high-performance air conditioning vent and a renewable CO2 scrubber. This scrubber removes CO2 from the air and releases it later. I've also added a new vent for disposing of CO2 outside, and in the future, I plan to introduce a specialized tank for storing CO2.\r\n\nI've also made provision for storing O2 bottles outside the base in a specially constructed shack, shielding them from solar radiation. This solution helps save valuable space within the pressurized modules of the base, further optimizing interior space usage and enhancing the overall functionality of your lunar base.\r  \n\r  \n**The escargot is back**\n\n\r  \nI'm excited to announce that the space rover 'Escargot' has made its return to Outer Space Shack. You might remember it from the 2021 trailer. Subsequent development focused more on astronauts, causing the rover to fall into the sidelines. But now, after some thorough overhauling, it's back in action. The rover is an outdoor operator, as it can't enter the space base, but it's designed to automatically undertake landscaping and transport tasks.\r  \n\r  \nIntegrating the rover has the significant advantage of reducing your astronauts' EVAs. EVAs pose radiation risks to the astronauts and consume valuable water resources, as the space suits are cooled using a water evaporator.\n\n([screenshot here](https://mcusercontent.com/bb34f60bf800f96dd552301fa/images/db0e91d7-f506-2da4-de0a-2d4a777dff52.jpg))\n\nNotably, the rover is indispensable for building regolith walls due to its ability to transport large regolith bags and blocks weighing a metric ton. Despite the Moon's lower gravity making this equivalent to just 150kg on Earth, it's still far too heavy for even the strongest astronaut.\r  \n\r  \nI'm also mulling over making the rover a necessary component for transporting materials to build space base modules. Some parts realistically weigh more than the 100kg that astronauts can safely transport on the Moon. I would love to hear your thoughts on this, and invite you to join the ongoing discussion here.\r  \n\r  \n**Exploring ISRU: The First Step**\n\n\r  \nISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization) involves the collection, processing, storage, and use of materials found or produced on celestial bodies like the Moon or Mars. These materials serve as a substitute for those that would traditionally be shipped from Earth. While the ultimate goal of ISRU is to construct space base modules, cultivate food, and fabricate necessary technology, the reality proves to be complex. Consider all the raw materials, factories, and diverse machinery required even to produce a simple object like a fork.\r  \n\r  \nThe initial implementation of ISRU in Outer Space Shack is modest but vital: a solar kiln constructs large blocks which can be stacked to create thick walls and roofs around space base buildings. The process of the solar kiln is slow, constructing one to two blocks per month. I'm currently exploring the possibility of integrating a combined solar/electric kiln for quicker block sintering.\r\n\n([screenshot here](https://mcusercontent.com/bb34f60bf800f96dd552301fa/images/e5476562-7467-b928-d238-3a992e60742b.jpg))\n\nThese blocks play a critical role in shielding the interior of the space base from harmful radiation. Radiation poses significant threats to the central nervous system, causing cognitive and motor function changes, and behavioral shifts. Acute effects can include radiation sickness symptoms like nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue.\r  \n\r  \nChronic exposure to radiation heightens the risk of developing diseases such as leukemia, lung, breast, thyroid, esophageal, stomach, and colon cancers, as well as affecting the central nervous system. Radiation can also cause eye damage, potentially leading to cataracts, and can compromise the immune system, making astronauts more prone to illnesses or infections.\r  \n\r  \nThus, while the large regolith bricks may seem mundane, they serve a crucial purpose. Two meters of this material is needed to shield effectively from radiation, making them an essential part of your lunar base's safety measures.\r  \n\r  \n**Exciting Quality of Life Enhancements**\r  \n\n\nAs we inch closer to release, with less than two months to go, a significant portion of my time has been spent fine-tuning the game, implementing several small yet essential improvements, many of which are long overdue. To summarize:\r\n\n* Expedited Transitions: The shift between the space center on Earth and the space base on your chosen celestial body is now faster and more fluid.\r\n* Multiple Save Files: I've added the capability to save several game files for those times when you want to try different strategies or start anew without losing progress.\r\n* Enhanced Function Screen: This feature has received a visual overhaul, providing a clearer, more appealing graphical interface. It's now accessible for all networks, encompassing electricity, heat, cold, clean water, dirty water, oxygen, and CO2. The screen now showcases top consumers and allows direct control to switch off systems as needed.\r\n* Prioritized Assembly: When assembling diverse structures on your chosen planet, power generating buildings are now assembled first. This priority is given because power is typically necessary to operate other buildings effectively.\r\n* Camera Improvements: The camera now provides smoother movements, enhancing overall visual experience. I've also included a feature where the camera can follow a land vehicle or astronaut for a more immersive experience.\r\n\n([screenshot here](https://mcusercontent.com/bb34f60bf800f96dd552301fa/images/80be164f-4aa4-c734-e781-c3119dc86381.jpg))\n\nI'm thrilled to confirm the official release date of Outer Space Shack - July 20th. This will mark a significant milestone in the game's journey and, as the old saying goes, 'you only get one chance to make a good first impression.'\r  \nIf you've enjoyed what you've seen of the game so far and haven't already done so, please consider [adding the game to your Steam wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620870/Outer_Space_Shack/). Your support can make all the difference. Thank you!",

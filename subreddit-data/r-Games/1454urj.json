Lucky PS5 owners.",

Yoshi, Lee, Feng, Dragunov, Eddy, Steve, Kuma (and/or Panda), one of the Ravens, and Lidia are pretty likely, I'd say and I wouldn't be surprised if Fahkumram also makes a return.  \nAlso, I personally hope that Armour King and Miguel also join again. Two of my favourites and AK in particular is just too awesome to be relegated to DLC again.",

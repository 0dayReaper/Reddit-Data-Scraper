CDPR essentially loosed angry customers on innocent customer service reps at Sony, Microsoft, and numerous retailers, weeks before Christmas, because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to actually take responsibility. That\u2019s the part that makes me angriest, as a former retail employee.",

It's like they're saying, \"Fine, you want to make us have to refund people?  Alright, but we're not going to sell anymore copies of your game until we know that flood of refund requests is going to stop.  Fix your shit.\"",

It also confirmed that they hadn't actually set up any special policy regarding the game's refunds, and it was up to the usual channels to handle requests(which is also just fucking gross since they did everything they could in that 'apology' to make it sound like that wasn't the case, while limiting their responsibilities to end a few days before Xmas). \n\n If that's Jeff Gertsmann's read, he seems absolutely spot on and I honestly am starting to think it's going to be a very long road for CDPR to ever get back to the trust they once enjoyed both professionally and in the public eye.\n\nEdit: also, I kinda wonder if it's related to them mentioning that they believe it was passed on faith has something to do with this.  Buggy games come out all the time on these consoles, but I can't imagine Sony/Microsoft execs being super happy with them spilling the beans that some companies get special treatment and are allowed to pass certification on a promise.",

Period, full stop, it's not even close.  But they assured Sony that it would by release, and Sony gave them a waiver.  We know what happened next.\n\nThat is a very different situation than FO76, Anthem, or any of the other spectacular debacles we've seen over the last few years.  Cert is a very low bar.  It is not meant to ensure that the game runs perfect, or even particularly *well*.  It is not meant to ensure that the game is *good*.  It is not meant to ensure that the game is mostly bug free.  You can get a pretty low quality buggy mess through cert just fine, as FO76 did.  \n\nCert is meant to ensure that at a very basic level, the game is capable of running on the hardware.  That's a much more fundamental issue, and *that* is where Sony is drawing a line.",

Most things that would break the game would instead take you to that screen, so it looked intentional to pass muster. Which is why there are so many weird ways to get to it, like wobbling the cartridge.",

Even as somebody who is enjoying this game ***on PC***, (where it is still riddled with issues), this game absolutely never should have been released in its current state on last-gen consoles. And the way that CDPR handled reviews -- intentionally obfuscating the state of the game, was disgraceful.\n\nCDPR fully deserves every ounce of criticism that they have received since this began. I genuinely feel horrible for the millions of people who bought this game on the PS4/Xbox One. I grew up in a household where we couldn't have every big game that came out; when me or my siblings really wanted something, my mom made it happen, but when we picked a game it had to last a while. All I can think of is that there are probably tons of people out there right now who are struggling during the pandemic who had to pick the game that had to last *them* a while, and what they got was... this. What was already an extremely scummy move by CDPR is made exponentially more scummy by fleecing people when everyone is hurting so much.\n\n100% the right thing to do. What CDPR has done should not be tolerated under any circumstances.",

Also hopefully this is the nail in the coffin for companies pushing out unfinished games and outsourcing beta testing to the end users. \n\nAlso another issue is overmarketing. If they delayed it another year, this wouldn't have happened. If they waited like 5+ yrs to even announce the game, this wouldn't have happened. If they kept more quiet about the game, this wouldn't have happened. If they marketed it as a next gen only game and gave a disclaimer to last gen console users saying quality can not be assured for last gen, this wouldn't have happened. \n\nThere were so many ways to prevent this, from early on, to right before release. So many missed opportunities to save face. They messed up big. \n\nAll that aside, I still have hope for the future of the game on PC and next gen. CDPR knows how to make games, but clearly they don't know how to run a business. Hopefully the issues get ironed out and the game becomes what it should have been at launch. The game itself is great, story is phenomenal, it's just plagued by technical issues that break immersion and feels like playing a game during alpha stage of development.",

Straight up refusing to sell their game on what\u2019s ~~probably their largest market~~. I get it, it\u2019s PC. \n\nWonder if Xbox follows suit. God damn. That is devastating. Even the shareholders will be angry about this one.\n\nBut it\u2019s kind of hilarious. I tried refunding a few days ago and a customer service rep told me to wait for the patches that fix the game and that they wouldn\u2019t be refunding me.\n\nThis is unprecedented. Wow. Has this ever happened before? In just one week, CDPR went from being perceived as the wholesome, pro-consumer, can-do-no-wrong studio to being the super memeable \"the only AAA game studio to ever put out a game so bad, Sony refused to sell it\" guys. The \"worse than Anthem and Fallout 76\" guys. Yowch. \n\nI feel sorry for the devs who tried their hardest and just weren't given the time, money or resources to pull it all off. \n\nEDIT: Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announced they\u2019re scrapping the multiplayer altogether to focus on the game\u2019s state and that they\u2019re making the DLC free. They\u2019re gonna have to No Man\u2019s Sky this shit. Whatever the case, probably gonna be a long-winded non-apology tomorrow.",

CDPR claimed that the only reason they passed console certification was because Sony/Microsoft thought they'd have the problems fixed before launch (which isn't actually uncommon in the industry, but that pass tends to get revoked if a dev fails to meet expectations).\n2. CDPR didn't actually work with anyone on their refund policy and instead just turned their angry fanbase on Sony/Microsoft.\n\nI can't imagine Sony was happy with the outcome of either situation, so it makes sense that Sony retaliated in this way.",

I'm not usually into video game internet drama but hot dog I love this back and forth.\n\nCDPR basically throwing their hands up telling Sony \"Whatever, you deal with it.\" was such an overplay.  Remember:\n\n* Sony has to pay MC / Visa / etc fees.\n* Sony has to pay bandwidth costs, which for 80 gb+ games are not trivial.\n* Sony has to pay for customer service representatives; CDPR bombarding PSN customer service with no warning will impact not just the costs but the quality + response time of the typical customer service issues (fraud, etc).\n\nCDPR was probably banking on Sony \"needing\" CP2077 for the holiday season... except they aren't even pushing the PS4 this holiday or next.  And there's still physical retail copies out there.  I think this move definitely hurts CDPR more than Sony.\n\nThis deterioration of business relations with what looks to be the major console manufacturer of the next 5-7 years (and possibly longer) is going to hurt their core business so much.  CDPR has been overvalued for years, especially as they are more or less a 1-game-at-a-time studio with a few million dollars of annual revenue for gog + gwent.  Yes, they keep costs low by hiring in Poland, but it's such a high risk venture, and I can't help but imagine we'll see the bubble burst very soon.  This will cause even more furor among investors.",

Business process outsourcing companies bill per call. Cost varies by industry,  but a hardware and subscription business like Playstation is almost certainly paying at least 5 or 6  dollars every time someone calls in (this is why companies push self service so hard). \n\nDumping hundreds of thousands of unanticipated calls onto the system is going to be a huge expense for them.",

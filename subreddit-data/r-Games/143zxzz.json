So, I guess I would rather them do whatever they feel set out to do because it is clearly working. \n\nHard to forget the journey through the Baker mansion though. Being terrified as you move through the basement. My only complaint about that game (other than the fact I didn't have 6+ hours more of gameplay) was the lack of enemy variety.",

It can affect a company/franchise's reputation and hurt future sales even if it doesn't hurt the sales of that game itself much.)",

You can compare elden ring to the rest of the souls franchise and it's on another level. DS3 sold 10 million by 2020 so elden ring selling that much in a year just shows how big it got.",

Resident Evil 8 having 8 million units sold has it easily in their top ten best selling titles ever. Most entries in their top ten are also Resident Evil games. Though Monster Hunter takes the top two slots.\n\n\nAlso *never* underestimate how much a draw going open world is for general audiences. I'm sure if Capcom could somehow figure out a way to make \"open world Resident Evil\" work well enough, it'd be selling like hotcakes.",

I'll come back at you after I get myself a degree to be capable of commenting in a subreddit dedicated to gaming news.  \n\n\nChill, I was just curious after I saw different articles about sold copies and was surprised  a game in RE universe wasn't as big as I thought. I'm glad to see a lot of people suggesting explanations, but there is really no need to be so presumptuous. No offense.",

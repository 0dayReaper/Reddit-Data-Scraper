            "comment": "Anyone else feel like we're in some new golden age of indies? These games are getting sharper, slicker, weirder, and more niche.\n\nThis all kind of feeds into a larger idea I've been having lately, fostered by the System Shock Remake about how old games really aren't bad. So many games get washed aside in the name of \"progress\" that original titles simply feel dated, but they are still full of fun, original ideas that weren't fully realized at the time because of technical limitations or just having the ideas tossed out wholesale after one go and without iteration.\n\nAtlus will never give us a Persona 1 sequel in a world where Persona 5 tore things up the way it did, but now we have indies for that. I don't care that this is unabashedly taking inspiration from Persona 1, the devs obviously know what they're doing, too. But that game had legs and I want to see what else we can do with it. This looks amazing! Gimme gimme gimme\n\nEDIT: To add, what makes me specifically excited about this title is that combat. In Persona 1, I found the positioning to be kind of a tedious hassle and would sometimes just brute force my way through it with less effective area of attack moves so as to not waste turns and drag the battle out even longer. This looks like it's got some serious Into the Breach positioning vibes and I'm here for it.",

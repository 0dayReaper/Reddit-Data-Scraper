The future of gaming subscription in the style of Game Pass is very much questionable since the numbers don't seem to be growing much anymore and at the same time big releases are selling really well.\n\nMicrosoft is leaving a lot of money on the table by having the likes of Starfield on Game Pass day one and at the same time that might not actually help subsriber numbers much",

For example, most people who are fans of the particular type of first party games that Sony offers (especially cinematic single player games) likely already own a Playstation because people know to expect these kinds of games from Sony. Releasing these games simultaneously on  XBox likely wouldn't increase the sales much for this very reason, certainly not enough to offset the revenue they'd lose by giving people less reasons to stay within the PS infrastructure.\n\nBethesda games on the other hand were always multiplatform releases so their audience is at the moment split between Sony and Microsoft consoles. Microsoft's goal is that people will eventually associate Bethesda games with their services and that fans of this particular style of game will move over there, ideally leaving the Playstation behind. But this means they have to burn a lot of money upfront. It's also still uncertain how much this will work as indended.",

Sony seems to be making a tidy sum of money porting their exclusive games to PC a few years later, and I can see Microsoft doing the same thing for the PS5. Timed exclusives let you have your cake and eat it too. The vast majority of players who want Starfield will get it on Xbox or PC, and the Playstation players who aren't willing to use another platform will buy it for full price two years later if it gets ported. I doubt they'll announce a port any time soon but given Bethesda's history I'm pretty damn sure it'll be on every platform possible at some point.",

After all, PS and Nintendo have been profiting off of exclusives since forever (Microsoft too for much of that). PS would\u2019ve loved making Starfield exclusive had they the opportunity.\n\nWhere the numbers don\u2019t quite add up for me, is the fact that Microsoft is making this game exclusive, without having a way to directly capitalize on that exclusivity. If you want to play Spider-Man 2 or FFXVI, for example, on the day they come out, you\u2019ll need to 1) own a PS5, 2) pay full price (on Sony\u2019s storefront). Starfield, on the other hand, will be completely available to play day one on other storefronts without the need to buy Microsoft hardware and for \u201cfree\u201d to game pass subscribers. How do they make their money back there?",

And let's not be disengenuous games do sell console idgaf what Phil says.  On the other hand hifi rush was played by less than 3 million people on gamepass which has around mid 30 million, if a game like that released on ps it would be FAR more beneficial for Microsoft than it would Sony. Starfield is one of those games that would sell like fucking hotcakes on ps, imo it would sell far more copies on ps than on Xbox if it remained multiplat, but micro is banking on that game boosting it's gamepass subs so they see that roi by not releasing it on other platforms",

Everyone does exclusives. But the *point* of doing exclusivity is to boost sales of your platform and close to 100% of the profit from games sold (since the only option, at least digitally, is to buy the game at a price you control on your own storefront). Without these two things (which simultaneous PC and  Game Pass releases already eliminate), why do exclusivity at all?",

These games are inherently quite hardcore and require a lot of inherent knowledge from gamers in terms of gameplay mechanics and control schemes to progress. We know that even basic, fundamental elements of modern games like controlling movement and camera with separate thumbsticks baffles a lot of people who didn\u2019t grow up playing games when they were younger, and very few games make any attempt to teach players of basic concepts like this. Like The Last of Us for example - I imagine there\u2019s probably a lot of nongamers interested in it after watching the TV show, but once you get over the hurdle of buying a console you now have the arguably greater hurdle of actually playing the game, learning the control scheme, learning language of gaming and what it means to play a 3rd person shooter.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the elephant in the room that AAA games in particular are targeted towards a very specific demographic of young males in terms of themes, plot points, genre, levels of violence etc that are probably a lot less appealing for people outside of that demographic. With a few exceptions really isn\u2019t a equivalent of a \u201cfour quadrant\u201d video game like there is with blockbuster movies.\n\nBut if it\u2019s not casual audiences like that, then who is streaming aimed at? Are there really that many people interested in console gaming who can\u2019t afford a console, yet can also afford a decent internet connection that can make streaming viable? Microsoft\u2019s Xcloud gives PlayStation owners a avenue to play Xbox games, but that isn\u2019t really expanding the market is it? Especially when many of the largest games in question (Starfield) were originally planned to launch on PlayStation anyway. And how do developers target different, more casual audiences without also alienating their existing fanbases, when doing so might require completely changing the game mechanics for people who don\u2019t speak the language of AAA video games?",

People who really want to learn will learn.\n\nNintendo made assumptions about modern controllers being too complex, and learned that even with a simple controller and a how-to-play DVD that this audience still didn't want their 3D Mario games or their Zeldas. Instead the audience kept buying Just Dance and Rabbids as seemingly Ubisoft were the only big publisher who understood the audience on that platform.\n\nSure the latest big game that sold 30 million might have over $2bn in revenue putting it not far behind the revenue of Avengers Endgame, but the movie sold over 300 million tickets to pull in that much cash, the audience for films is still over 10x as large any video game games media/this sub actually talks about. I include that caveat because somehow most of games media has decided they can just talk about Fortnite like it is some cute little curiosity and not more popular than anything else they write about.\n\nLike maybe there is some market niche I'm blind to, but I can't imagine this market niche gives a shit about 95% of what is on Gamepass. And I guess that is why Microsoft wanted COD of Gamepass. There probably is a sizeable audience of people that would like to play their COD/Fortnite/FIFA/etc without having to shell out for the console, but those games are all 60fps+ low latency experiences not exactly easily to deliver via streaming.\n\nAs for the other three quadrants, what in the gaming space is aimed at them that would need to be streamed instead of just run on their phone or smart TV web browser?",

Cloud gaming, historically, has been attached to egregious services involving awful subscription plans or/and marketplaces that offer poor value to most consumers. \n\nThere's a lot that needs to be done to change this general perception of cloud gaming.

That means the company has to provide CPUs and GPUs for every user.  Not only does that mean a massive amount of heat, it means substantially more heat than individually owned computers.  Heat is partially a function of ambient temperature.  Each \"computer\" reinforces and raises that ambient temperature to some level that would be higher than at home, making the components run hotter, and needing more cooling.  Basically, it means that these server farms become massive climate change problems.\n2. That means the company has to acquire electricity for every user.  Nowhere in the world produces enough electricity to power server farms to provide gaming capacity for several hundred million people.  They're literally going to have to build power plants just to serve these farms.  Which is another climate change problem.\n3. That means that they have to have capacity for everyone.  If they try and do queues it'll tick off customers, and people will simply never log out so they don't have to queue.  It'll be a huge social problem.\n4. That means that if you get banned, you lose all access to gaming.  So trolls and grieffers have enormous power.  Nevermind getting into fights with friends who have your login or breaking up with a boyfriend/girlfriend.  Huge social problems.\n5. That means games will be made for an LCD of hardware.

MS was hoping people would get hooked by the great deal/workaround and eventually turn into normal full time subscribers. Game Pass was, and still is in some sense, a loss leader for them. They expected to lose money short term for longer term gains. Unfortunately I don't think the market for console quality subscriptions is as big as they hoped. \n\nMS got fixated on the total number of gamers, but failed to realize that not all gamers are the same. Some only play a limited number of multiplayer games, like Madden, so don't see a need for a subscription. Then there is a large number of casual PC \"gamers\" who aren't playing high end AAA games, and a subscription doesn't save them money because the games they play are cheaper. \n\nA full time Game Pass subscription really only ever made sense for gaming enthusiasts who can't get enough games to play.",

What about hundred hour open world games that are gonna dominate a bunch of time if they aren't on gamepass, like the recently released TOTK?

Those who pay attention and are smart about it save money, those who aren't (aka never cancel or really think about if they're actually using it) pay more.\n\n2. People who don't generally buy many games in the first place because of the high cost of entry see it as a non-committal way to try more games.\n\nI'm in the second boat. However I also did the thing to get 3 years of it for like 100 bucks lol",

My biggest fear is if subscription model become more mainstream every gaming companies want their own service\nand will stop selling physical and even digital games to boost subsribers. This is exactly what happen to tv industry right now.Most Netflix and Disney Plus original  show didnt get physical or even allow you to purchase digital version. If they gone from service they will gone forever. So if you want to play future FF, Resident Evil, Yakuza you must subscribe to 3 different service by Square Enix, Capcom and Sega.",

LOTR show? The Velma show? Projects like these only happen because of subscriptions services.",

It's only useful when it's a single service that makes it cheaper/convenient to access the games for more people. When everyone's taking it to their own Disney+, HBOMax, etc. kinds of things it just becomes another subscription hassle for players. Also it further distances us from the time when we owned the games we played.",

They're not _quite_ going full Sega, but the parallels are there. \n\nIf the concept of Xbox basically being a Gamepass box doesn't pan out (which it still could, but doesn't seem to be doing incredibly well at what with AAA games releases slowing down in general in favor of bigger releases less often), I don't see them continuing their console line. People can get cheap A/AA games anywhere making gamepass less attractive.",

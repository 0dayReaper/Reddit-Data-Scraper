It's not Dino Crisis related, but here's Regina as totally just a cameo... \n\n\nBut then this trailer revealed that the plot is literally what causes the events of Dino Crisis 1. Time traveling to harvest energy from the past. Like wholesale that's **just** Dino Crisis 1's backstory.\n\nI'm positive that someone went in and went \"Yeah fans would be upset if this was the next Dino Crisis game\".\n\nIt's honestly just bizarre.",

                    "comment": "It makes sense from a business perspective. It gets new people into the Dino Crisis universe without directly tying its title in to cause confusion. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re probably working on a proper Dino Crisis remake or follow-up, but there\u2019s no way they\u2019d do it at the scale of the RE remakes with how relatively obscure the property is at this point. And if this fails, they can still release a new Dino Crisis without this marring the name.",

This article is definitely just screaming into the void because it's not going to change a single thought at Blizzard who's raking in the cash, but I still appreciate the effort because we *shouldnt* just accept this as our new norm, even if it is.",

They made it possible to buy all items with in-game currency (seasonal items were originally loot box only), they made it so that seasonal items got cheaper over time, and they made it so that you were guaranteed to get only new items in loot boxes rather than duplicates.\n\nIt's only when OW2 came out that the monetization became really terrible again.",

I think these games typically get put on sale early in their life cycle because the real money is in the so-called microtransactions, and it's in the company's best interest to get as many people onto the platform as possible so that they have a large group to sell cosmetics to! So I think it'll go on sale within the first year (not 50%, probably more like 30%), but for all the wrong reasons!\n\nAnd just to say, you're right about the D3 launch. The auction house debacle was so bad, and the servers clearly couldn't handle the load for like a week.",

People who don't have that fear are the next ones to be targeted that only buy games on sale. Blizzard knows this if we do, they get those that can't resist the urge to overpay for a week early access and, I'd guess by the holidays the game is 39 to 19$, because they want to expand the user base to the patient gaming crowd and hope to cash in on their in game transactions while the game is still relatively fresh. \n\nBut I think that is just business as usual for blizzard. They aren't really out here trying to make the best products anymore.  They're just out to get the most amount of people seeing their available ingame purchases, its who they have become.",

Not Fortnite, not Halo, not Deeprock Galactic, not rocket league, not any bp game ever. \n\nSo to me it's useless because even if I pay for the pass I'll never actually get all the things in there. It's a complete loss for me. I lose out on all the unique content no matter if I have the money or not. (And I'm definitely not spending $100 for level skipping stuff, no game is worth that much)\n\nSo battle passes are just a straight up lose situation for me. They're annoying as hell. Just let me progress on my own time, I can't just drop everything and play 1 game for the rest of time.\n\nAt least deep rock puts that stuff in a free item rotation after the season ends, wish other games would adopt this.",

The difference is Diablo 4 has some great looking sets and cosmetics for horses, etc. in the base game and even as a cash shop peruser I don't feel the need to buy any of them. But if I did see a set I really wanted, $28 would be a tough pill to swallow.\n\nBoth good games that have room for constructive criticism except Diablo 4 has been out for 2 days. I don't expect price adjustments but if people aren't willing to pay, something will give. So keep the criticism coming and give Blizzard room to improve.",

What? Not everyone plays necros? Weird.\n* Distinct areas with consistency\n* Combat is clean, swift, varied, and eventually as difficult as you want it to be, to challenge you to the limits.\n  - Or just play at level 1 difficulty and finish the story, start a new character\n* Getting that hit from finding gear\n  - But also super quality of life - can extract and apply unique properties where you want\n* Play with Friends/Clan easily\n* Randomly bump into other people with certain events, highlighted in yellow circles on the map\n  - You can beat the event together, then you both go your separate ways",

Went from having to grind dungeons (admittedly, many were not good early on) for the fancy gear to all the best stuff being in the shop. Yes, you can grind or play the market to get the premium currency, but I have a life and other games to play. Sure, you can get some decent stuff via regular gameplay, but prepare to do the same unchallenging grinds for ages or pay real money if you want the coolest stuff. \n\nCOSMETICS. ARE.

When people complain about the prices in the shop on the d4 sub,  there is inevitably a comment like \"laughs in POE\". If POE can charge as much as they do and stay afloat JUST on that revenue then Blizzard figured they could keep a live service game up with half the price of shop items and charging for the game. In Diablo I don't even really notice what my character looks like, I guess at least I can see the skins unlike most other games with paid cosmetics like COD and Overwatch but it just doesn't feel like a game where cosmetics are very important\\\\ or make much of a visual difference at all",

There are mounts where you can have multiple people sitting on it. Which is (or was) not possible until then. There is no way to defend it because the shop is HUGE. And yes, also when it comes to only looks: It is part of the game. There is a reason people say: Glamour is the real engame.",

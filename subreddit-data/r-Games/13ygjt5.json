            "comment": "I'm gonna sound a little mean here, so I'll just preface this by saying that ultimately there's nothing wrong with breaking the game how you want. Just because a developer designed something with intent, doesn't mean everyone's going to enjoy it.\n\nThat said, while this is a perfectly understandable sentiment for an average player just looking for some fun, this is an embarrassing article for someone who's supposed to be a game critic. Even for the low bar of games journalism, there should be some attempt to understand *why* the design is in place, not just say \"I don't like it\" and leave it at that.\n\n&gt;Presumably there\u2019s a desire to protect the purity of the experience asthe developers intended it but, on the other hand, where\u2019s the harm?\n\nAnyone claiming to be a game critic should have at least a passing understanding of the idea that, as Civ IV designer Soren Johnson put it, \"given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.\" By removing one aspect of TotK - weapon degradation - players might find that other parts of the gameplay loop aren't enough to keep them invested. Why continue to experiment with Fuse when you find the unbreakable weapon combo you like? Does exploring caves still feel good when most rewards are weapons that you'll never need again?\n\nI haven't played with the duplication cheat, but Nintendo has a reasonable expectation that the bug might negatively affect players' enjoyment of the game. And players always blame designers if they're not having fun, not their own actions, so it's a no-win scenario here.\n\n&gt;When Hidemaro Fujibayashi found schlepping back out of caves dull and boring, he cheated and magically teleported to the surface\n\nThis is obviously not the same thing as an unintended bug in the game. Adding the Ascend ability wasn't just a switch the devs flipped, it would have required extensive QA and playtesting to make sure it didn't break the game or leave players stuck. An exploit can't be tested the same way. \n\n&gt;The weapons I collect ultimately feel meaningless when they will break without notice. It\u2019s hard to be excited about finding a new one when I know it\u2019ll soon be in a thousand pieces if I start using it. On the advice of my son I flew to the suspended castle to obtain what he insisted were several powerful swords and bows. They all broke within a few encounters. Gathering them had been a total waste of time and, to be honest, the idea of needing to put up with this system exhausted me, and the Fuse system wasn\u2019t salvaging it.\n\nThis is just gamer hording brainworms. It took me time to unlearn the hording mentality while playing Breath of the Wild, but the game very clearly doesn't want you to play it like a JRPG, never using your strongest consumables. The game is entirely about discovering new things, and part of that isn't clinging onto old stuff. Experiment! Use the good stuff - it'll break, for sure, but you realize quickly the game practically showers you in other strong weapons.\n\nIt's the same reason why your Ultrahand projects break after a while, you're meant to use stuff in the moment and leave it behind. You might not prefer this, but the fact that it's in the game is very intentional. Avoiding stuff you don't like is fine, but I think it does make you a shitty, unimaginative critic.",

I know it's sort of a silly aesthetic issue but it really hurts the experience for me. There are a bunch of cool looking weapons in chests that you only get to use on a few enemies and then are gone forever. Does exploring caves feel good when most rewards are weapons that you'll use for less than 5 minutes?\n\nMechanically I feel I spend a lot more time then I like in the menu picking the right weapon for each enemy. I get what they are going for but I have more fun with a cheat going for infinite durability.",

That might sound kind of paternalistic, but players generally min-max and take the path of least resistance when left to their own devices and that can ruin their fun without them realizing it.

My evidence being this very article where the author is having far more difficulty than they need to with weapon management because they think they need to grind for specific weapons. I've played for about 15 hours and the game is showering me with weapons, these complaints aren't differences of opinion, they just literally don't make sense. \n\nPersonally, I haven't played with item duplication, and I can't say that I'd find the game more or less fun with it. But Nintendo does extensive in-house playtesting, and I'd be pretty confident that they know what they're doing when helping players find the fun factor.\n\n(EDIT: for sure, play how you personally want, I'm just arguing that Nintendo has legitimate reasons for wanting to patch it out.)",

What narrative did Pong have? What narrative control did you have in DOOM?\n\nSome people love speedrunning games. Are they having fun wrong? Is Orcarina of Time a bad game because it can be speedrun? Oblivion has a duplication glitch that never got patched, and a debug console. Did that impact your enjoyment of it?",

It's like you want to pull off something clever, or fight a group of enemies, but you end up treading the path of the least resistance for the sake of reserving resources. \n\nYou're given a high level of freedom, but that lack of rule restriction makes everything so trivial and puzzles are no longer stimulating, and it's never worthwhile to fight a group of enemies. Having something like a larger capacity from the get go just makes it more interesting for me. \n\nHaving to remake certain vehicles over and over again is a chore, so they give you Autobuild, but it costs so much to use.\n\nI wish they split the difference between the previous formula and BOTW when they developed TOTK. Maybe it's something they're doing in the next iteration of Zelda for their next console. Seldom do they stick to the same style of an entry in the series beyond one sequel.",

(This has marginally improved with the Steam page actually showing some gameplay screens, which is nice.) But I do think they maybe should have put out another trailer for the Steam release combining the accolades (a few few outlets did praise the game), with a coherent summary of what the game is.\n\nGood marketing lets your target audience know about a game, and lets people who aren't the target audience know to stay away. People buying your game expecting A but getting B is a bad outcome for everyone.\n\nFor example, this game -- VtM: Justice -- is a game where few people are going to buy it expecting an RPG. It's a stealth action VR game.\n\nBut with Swansong, you wound up with this situation it was not communicated effectively enough to people that it's an RPG built around dialogue and investigation. They're like, \"There's no combat. All you do is talk to people!\" There's no combat in Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, and nobody complains about that. Because the audience for those games understands this, wants this, is in sync with developer intent.",

On the whole, I feel that the character models and animation are better in Swansong, but there's a distinct inconsistency that The Council hid better.\n\nLike, I wouldn't agree that [Halsey](https://imgur.com/mSTEEWK) or [Richard](https://imgur.com/935zABP) look worse than [the cast of The Council](https://imgur.com/7wlOM8T). I'm pretty sure a bunch of the character models were done by Virtuos, and they do good work. But the animation is ultimately BigBadWolf, and the more realistic models make any animation shortcomings more noticeable.\n\nSwansong aims for a level of visual fidelity in its environments and characters that they don't have the animation proficiency to fully sell across the length of the game. For example, the opening cutscene in the elevator? Journey's animation, including lip sync, is easily the worst in the entire game. Then other times in the game the characters are very well lit, animated, etc.",

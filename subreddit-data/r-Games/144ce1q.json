To give an impression, there are 7 difficulties, and every heist in the game has achievements for beating it on (or above) each difficulty. There are, to date, 87 heists, so that's 600+ achievements just for level completions, before getting into the more specific challenges.\n\nPayday devs just love their achievements. Many of them are directly tied to in-game unlocks.",

The biggest was the addition of safes in 2015, which were basically microtransaction loot boxes. That led to a lot of uproar, since the devs had previously promised that the game would never have microtransactions. It was never explicitly confirmed that the publisher forced them to add them, but in 2016 the developers purchased the Payday franchise IP, taking full ownership from the publisher, and immediately removed the microtransactions.\n\nThe more recent controversy was the Ultimate Edition. In 2017, the devs announced that they were done with Payday 2 DLC, and offered a bundle of all the content for one price instead of having loads of individual DLC packs on the store. It was advertised as the complete Payday 2 package, containing everything up until the third game. In 2019, they went back on this - Payday 3 was still nowhere near release and the studio was struggling to keep the lights on, so they started making more Payday 2 DLC again. That's where we're at now. The new stuff from the past few years has been pretty solid, so I don't think the community is too upset anymore, just waiting for 3 to finally drop.",

It's definitely fun, but I'd be a little worried about it being overwhelming to try to get into at this point. If your friends enjoy co-op shooters, and are willing to dig through some old-game jank, you'd probably have a blast.\n\nThat said, Payday 3 is supposed to come out later this year, so it might be worth it to wait for that and have a fresh start with (hopefully) more modernized gameplay.",

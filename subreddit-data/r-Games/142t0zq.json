In the UK everyone I knew had Mega Drives or Amigas growing up, I didn't even see my first NES or SNES in person until well into the 32 bit era. People were more likely to be playing Dizzy than Mario in the 80s. It's the same for other industries, I count count how many tech YouTubers I've seen call Minidisc a failure when everyone had a Minidisc player in the early 2000s at my school.",

            "comment": "I don't see why Croc selling as many copies as Banjo Kazooie makes it just as \"iconic\".\n\nBanjo is largely beloved for it's quality.  It's a very good game with a good sense of humour.  Croc on the other hand, was just a rather average game.\n\nI mean the fact that Croc 2 sold poorly while Banjo Tooie didn't is pretty clear that Croc didn't have the staying power that Banjo did, which in turn also adds against the \"popularity\" argument too.",

It didn't transform the landscape of gaming. Controlwise it was Bubsy 3D with better level design. Nobody went and played fucking Croc and decided that this was the game that would make them create something else. Nobody cites Croc as their inspiration to get into the industry and make a fucking video game.\n\nI can quite literally point to any Nintendo console or a game released for it which has inspired the industry to be better. The standard console controller layout is literally a SNES controller with analog sticks and an extra set of should buttons for a reason.",

Shit, a lot of fans didn't even remember Banjo Kazooie, because guess what?  Banjo Kazooie had two games that people cared about and then some spinoffs and whatever that mess was on the 360.  \nNobody cared about Croc because Croc was a generic ass platformer that was--it was *fine*.  But I can assure you that Croc had no lasting power, not even on the playstation.  People on the playstation didn't care about Croc.  \nNobody bought a PS2 and thought god I hope they import Croc to this!  \nI just noticed Time Extension, whoever these guys are, just put up a few articles, like, 3 articles in a few days about Croc?  I assume they're getting paid to do this?  Because literally nobody else cares at this point about Croc.",

Basically some people on Twitter complained that terry was a bad choice for smash because \u201cnobody cared about him\u201d and he got in before banjo who\u2019s more popular. \n\nSo someone made a counterpoint by saying croc sold about as well as banjo and yet nobody cares about croc but everyone cares about banjo, going as far to suggest that this is due to Nintendo YouTubers collectively gaslighting the world into thinking banjo was way more popular than it really was.\n\nFor whatever reason people started talking about this again a few days ago. At the end of the day different countries experience things differently and that\u2019s true for gaming as well. shouldn\u2019t be controversial but it somehow is.",

Nobody could with a straight face say that Croc was as good as Mario 64. The N64 was way too expensive to buy games for and the Gamecube couldn't play DVDs, and as such the PS1 and PS2 could grow much without much competition. This doesn't diminish the impact of game design decisions made within Nintendo, which were still far ahead of their competition.",

Citizen Kane was a complete flop on release and is now considered one of the most iconic and influential movies of all time.\n\nI mean, the entire Dark Souls series has sold 33 million units worldwide. The free-to-play mobile game \"The Simpsons: Tapped Out\" has 80 million active users. Which one are we going to spend more time talking about? Which one deserves more discussion in terms of history and cultural impact?\n\nI'm not arguing that nintendo platformers are citizen kane but they've undeniably had more cultural impact than Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. I enjoyed it as a kid but the controls and platforming of that game ended up being an evolutionary dead end.",

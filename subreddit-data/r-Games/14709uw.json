The game does have an \"obvious path\", but it looked like tons of options to find your own way up the structure you're climbing.\n\nSeemed very cool, definitely wishlisted it based off that 30 minutes.",

Could it see it being \"metroid-like\" in the sense of maybee you go around unlocking abilities to be able to advance your climb in other areas? I'm super intrigued either way",

You can jump across gaps, but doing so costs a lot of stamina so you need to be thoughtful and efficient with your climbs. You place pitons through longer climbs so that if you fall you don't have to start back from the beginning.\n\nIf it's cheap enough I'll definitely buy this just to support the devs but if it's too expensive then gamepass for sure.",

I think it's something that CAN be interesting, and I'd imagine if they're building a game around it they must have something figured out. I'm pretty excited about this one.",

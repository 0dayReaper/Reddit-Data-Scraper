The character models look like something going for more of a Tim Burton or Don\u2019t Starve vibe. Oddly, the character portraits in the upper corners haven\u2019t changed, which seems lazy. \n\nIn the last few seconds of the trailer it cycles through a few different character varieties.",

I hope they take it farther than that with some truly different animation styles. Honestly even doing several different videogame styles would be cool.",

You can't just leech the popularity out of Cuphead while presenting the audience with something... lesser.",

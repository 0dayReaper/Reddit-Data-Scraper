So he probably didn't create the FBC or Jesse, but his writing may have pushed events to go a certain way to have a specific outcome. Essentially, he can't create the pieces of a chess board, but he can push them to make certain moves and shift them around.",

Hearing Alan's narration gives me CHILLS. \n\nIt will be interesting to see how well the game sells, though. The combination of Alan Wake being exclusive to the 360 for a number of years and releasing around the same time as Red Dead Redemption really put a damper on its initial popularity. Additionally, it doesn't seem like they're shying away from this game being a sequel which creates a small barrier of entry.",

It's something I can't stop noticing now and I'm pretty sure I'm not just making connections where there are none. Like any other reveal or behind the scenes video for an anticipated game would normally be 99% liked. But any time there is a minority and/or female main character you can see that distribution change. Pretty sad that that's where we're at...",

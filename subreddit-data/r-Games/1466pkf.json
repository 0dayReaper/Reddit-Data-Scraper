If this is drawing from the third-person over-the-shoulder era it doesn't really feel unique enough. Generic environments, character designs, and really generic monster designs.",

Capcom saw it and made them cancel the project, but also invited them to their HQ in Japan to give their input to the development team of the actual RE2 Remake. They're even in the credits of the game. And the original game while janky is a decent homage to RE, Paul Haddad (Leon from the OG game) is even on it which is neat",

That's obviously not a popular style anymore but it at least felt unique in this climate?\n\nThis looks like a COD Zombies knock-off and the high-tech stuff in the 90s feels anachronistic in a bad, cheesy way.",

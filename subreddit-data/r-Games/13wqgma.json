But one explanation unique to Imperial, fascist, Japan is that the officer corp generally abused (physically and verbally) their soldiers, and then that abuse went down the chain, taking their frustrations below, since it was normalized and expected... And then finally the common soldier had no one below them... except for local civilians.\n\nThere is another essential part. Dehumanization. It's one thing for a few soldiers to give in to their baser instincts, its another for it happen on a broad level. If the victim doesn't count then who cares. \n\nI suspect this may be in part behind Russian atrocities in Ukraine.",

Poland and Ukraine have had historic disputes over land and culture. The baltics really don't care about much beyond being anti-Russia especially. Obviously on an individual basis this isn't always true, but geopolitically the last time any of these countries actually cared about the well being of each other was in the late 1980's. \n\nIt's not like in western europe or north america where everyone jokes around with their neighbors. The fall of the USSR really fractured the area, the entirety of eastern europe are run by various far right groups with basically the same politics but different types of racism. It's just all these different forms of far right nationalism that aren't compatible with each other. Russia (the political class at least) yearns for Tsarist Russia and the Russian Empire, while Ukraine has a more modern far right \"blood and soil\" ethnic nationalism flavor. Same with the baltics and Poland, but those places have their \\*own\\* version of that that excludes the others. \n\nBasically it just comes down to all these places arguing which is \"less white\" and posting pictures at each other online of a woman from their country with a non-white guy and accusing the others of being homosexuals. I saw a thread on twitter of a ukranian guy and a russian guy just calling each other slurs endlessly. That's basically what the whole thing is about. \n\nThis might seem all unrelated but the initial point is that no one genuinely cares about \"Ukrainian Sovereignty\", it's just geopolitics. You get people posturing online but it's just people who want to feel like they have the \"right opinions\". \n\nGonna get a lot of angry comments about this I'm sure. But I did want to sort of clarify on that point.",

The entirety of eastern Europe is not ran by far-right groups, most of eastern Europe is ran by center-right parties that also happen to be pretty pro-eu, which means your whole point about them peddling some version of xenophobia (on a national level) is just pure bullshit.\n\nWhen it comes to individuals in the population, you can definitely find racists and xenophobes in all the countries but I'm sure everyone can agree that it's not clearly indicative of how the country as a whole feels. So the examples of those places arguing about which is \"less white\" is also mostly bullshit because you're basing it off anecdotal evidence.\n\nYou should also clarify what you mean by \"genuinely care\" because IMO taking in war refugees and offering them a chance for a more normal life is a pretty genuine care, also sending arsenal to Ukraine to make sure they have something to fight with is less genuine but still better than what you generally see far-right parties peddle, which is that we shouldn't interfere at all because it's not our fight.\n\nSo if you are going to get \"angry comments\" like mine, it's because you're just wrong about a lot of what you said.",

I'd be interested in learning more about how the games library compared to other regions.  \n\nThe Dendy cartridges did not have a battery and therefore no Savegames... that is a pretty big difference.",

Most of the Famicom games that used saves like Metroid, Zelda, Kid Icarus, or RPGs were either Disk System games (so they didn't get a pirate cart or if they did I never saw one) or they were entirely in Japanese which no kid could read so they were unplayable.\n\nCome to think of it, I hardly ever saw any pirate carts with advanced mappers besides Super Mario 3.",

I don't know if the hackers who made pirate Famicom carts bothered porting those games from FDS but if they did, I never saw a copy. \n\nAnd yeah, we missed out on some classics but it's hard to feel too bad about missing out on something you didn't know existed.

When people were finally getting colour PAL TVs.\n\nAs for the library, it's whatever the hell pirates were making. Aladdin by Super Game, Street Fighter 3, Chip and Dale 3 in Vietnam were popular, but it wasn't much more than normal pirate cards with a seal of quality sticker on the back if it was the Dendy store.",

The regular Russian person probably agrees that Ukraine is Russian on some level and should be theirs. And more importantly, do not care that much about the torture chambers in Kherson or the mass rapes in Bucha.",

Americans were propaganda'd into believing Iraq had nukes, and had something to do with 9/11. Utter panic was exploited by cynical political actors, and thousands died as a result.\n\nRussia is different from this. There's nothing specific they're afraid of. A large part of them want Ukraine to stop existing as a state. There is a national program of kidnapping tens of thousands of Ukranian children for the purpose of educating them as Russian. In short, the societal and national goal is the genocide of the Ukranian people. That's why the mass rapes, the castrations, the kidnappings, the ethnic cleansing.\n\nRussia's goal, and they say this openly in their propaganda channels, is the destruction of the Ukranian identity. They say this openly because this isn't controversial domestically.\n\nNumbers on *that* behaviour I can't give, but take your time and browse Russian social media and it will come in loud and clear. Right now, the loudest and strongest opposition to Putin is the ultra nationalist community that thinks Putin isn't going far enough.\n\nThe entire society is sick, and it'll take generations to heal.",

We will hit a point of no return. I'm not saying society will completely collapse, but there will be a breakdown.",

If you dehumanize Nazi's, that leads to a type of thinking that stops you from having to learn about how they came to be. Why people are Nazi's. Why people \"like\" fascism. How it gets into society. And if you do that, you forget everything we learned and are going to repeat those same mistakes.\n\n\nWhile there were certainly people who famously went against the Nazi's in Germany, and those people should be celebrated, the rest of people didn't. Most people went along with it. That doesn't make them inhuman. But that also doesn't mean they deserve you feeling bad for them.\n\n\nSo no, I refute your assumptions about me. And how that translates into your next statement alluding to racism is just.. bad. That says a lot about you that your \"go to\" thought process is that someone is racist.\n\n\nI am not going to further this conversation with you. Good day.",

That the disputed land they\u2019re fighting over is universally recognized as a part of Azerbaijan? If anything Armenia should be the one getting the Russia treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s baffling that people can look at Russia invading Ukraine unter the excuse of liberating ethnic Russians there, declaring Ukraine to be a \u201cfake country\u201d and violating it\u2019s territorial integrity, and rightfully condemn it, but when Armenia does the exact same thing to Azerbaijan somehow Armenians are the victims and Azerbaijan is the agressor despite the fighting taking place inside internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan occupied and invaded by Armenia, and despite most civilian casualties in this war being perpetrated by Armenia.\n\nNewsflash for you: Ukraine also supports Azerbaijan, not Armenia.",

If Russia takes over Ukraine it puts Russia's sphere of influence on the border of several EU/NATO members. And to the east Japan has had over a century of animosity with Russia. Japan doesn't want am aggressive Russia trying to reestablish and empire.\n\nWhat Azerbaijan is doing is wrong but they aren't a threat in the same way Russia is.",

Even if that road will be painful, we want the road of war to be painful as well to push towards the other road.\n\n Even if this is not their intent, you have been inconvenienced and that's a good thing",

A lot of the fantasy surrounding mechs is that they do not carry enough resources for sustained use, that they are a tool deployed for limited engagements before needing to restock / refuel. That fantasy lends itself well to a missions structure, but not an open world one.",

The entire gameplay loop was: Get dropped near objective area &gt; infiltrate objective area &gt; complete objective &gt; escape area &gt; get picked up. You didn\u2019t have to wait until you were in the desert to call an exfil. You could call an exfil at any time, even in the middle of most bases, provided you took care of the anti-air radar. You could even call in a helo at a base in the middle of a gunfight.\n\nMGSV was by far the most open and flexible in terms of player freedom than the entire rest of the franchise. The issues with it were absolutely not in the gameplay, but in the glaring lack of a satisfying conclusion and seemingly an entire third act.\n\nAs a longtime fan of MGS, I think V is easily the best one in its mechanics, gameplay loop and replayability, but I still firmly hold Snake Eater as the best story-wise.",

Would I love a mech combat game that controlled smoothly and seamlessly like an action-adventure game? Absolutely, and they're out there, but that's not Armored Core either. AC didn't feel like a an arcade shooting game; it felt like *driving a war machine*. I want a really good \"war machine driving game\" again. I can't wait! I'm emulating all the old ones right now to get back into it.\n\nI love MechWarrior too. MW5 is really good but it's not the same either. It's like the difference between flying an airplane versus a helicopter, or the difference between an engineer operator and a pilot. Similar functions, completely different skill set. This is a pretty good era for all of those types of games though, especially if ACVI is good.",

The loading screens were hidden to create the illusion of a larger world, but still more or less kept you on a path that had decisions within it. Most open world games have you following the same basic, wide path. Fast travel defeated the purpose of open world by removing it's necessity entirely. It makes sense in a game where maybe there wasn't any easy path from A to F that didn't include stops at B through E. But it's definitely not met it's potential if there's nothing engaging me between A and F in the open world such that I will choose to use fast travel.",

It was by far the most railroaded zelda and the constant interruptions to tell you what to do ruined it. A lot of others would complain about the motion controls but I think that was the only good thing about it in combat at least. The sky motion controls are pointless.",

I really appreciated Sekiro's addition where they let you do exactly this. Of course you can go too far with it and the Erdtree Avatars they have been reusing for like 5 games now and put like 15 of in the game were a bit much. Even then I don't see it as a strong negative really since they are such a tiny slice of the game and not remotely required. \n\nI think reusing basic enemies excessively is much much worse than reusing bosses, Elden Ring had plenty normal enemy variety for me but something like Breath of the Wild was just absurdly bad. I still don't understand how such a high budget high production value game ended up with like 8 enemies or whatever.",

Maybe the bosses would be stronger and with more moves, like in the Pokemon games with the VS Seeker where you can rebattle old opponents. \n\nThat way, the world is still condensed and tighter, there's less wandering into new areas just to find the same bosses, but you still get those challenging repeated boss battles as well.",

I got serious burnout just finishing the game, and would have been very happy if the game ended sooner after Leyndell with more effort put into making the re-used content you're talking about more unique.\n\nThat would have probably bumped the game up from around an 8/10 for me to a 9 or 10.",

Every time someone brings up the boss re-use and tedious dungeon prefabs someone makes the excuse that it was necessary because of just how much they had to fill and expecting them to put unique enemies everywhere is silly.

If everything in Elden Ring was condensed down a good 30% I think it would've been brilliant while maintaining it's great sense of awe and scale.\n\nI also thought the pacing of getting new gear in Elden Ring kinda sucked compared to Souls 2 and 3 too, but if it were scaled down and more dungeons had interesting treasures like armor sets and weapons, I think even the blander dungeons would feel more rewarding.",

However, after much discussion, we decided that we didn't want to make a title that centered on traversal and exploration like Elder Ring or the Souls series. At the end of the day, the Armored Core series is all about assembling your character's movement and affecting the gameplay, and that's what makes the series so compelling.\n\n&gt;It's designed to make you think about how fast you can move through jumps and boosters, and the combination of those parts will determine how high you can reach and how fast you can go. In this respect, we felt that exploration was not a good fit for the gameplay of Armored Core. This led us to the conclusion that Armored Core VI would be more of a mission-based experience using assembly.\n\n&gt;However, there's still a lot to love about Armored Core's ability to find your way around. You'll still find the same style of dynamically moving around a three-dimensional map with lots of elevation changes. We hope you enjoy this aspect. I think you'll find a different kind of enjoyment in moving around and exploring the nooks and crannies of a well-crafted map.\n\nThere's so much variation in how ACs can move and how quickly they do so based on the player's preferences that they didn't think that the kind of exploration in Dark Souls or an open world would be a good fit.",

Instead of learning how this Armored Core game is going to be, it's constantly compared to Dark Souls. \n\nArmored Core has never been anything like any Dark Souls or Elden Ring or Bloodborne or Sekiro or Demon's Soul or Kings Field game. It's a make-your-own giant robot shooter. I'd say \"think Daemon ex Machina\" but I guarantee most people never played it.\n\nA lot of newer fans are going to be sorely disappointed when they find that out after buying the game.",

It's absurd at this point that the only consistent linear experiences in shooters you get is from freaking Call of Duty and boomer shooters made on a shoestring budget.

For example, going from Undead Burg to the Darkroot Garden shouldn't feel like switching between two completely different levels in a video game, the player should feel like it makes sense within the scope of this world that a garden would exist underneath Undead Burg.  I do feel like Elden Ring and Bloodborne fully captured this feeling as well.\n\nThere was also an excerpt about how they wanted players to go to any landmark they could see.  This has stayed relatively consistent through the games, but especially so with the original Dark Souls, and again with Elden Ring.\n\nI thought those insights into the design process were pretty cool, I would check out the Design Works books if that kinda stuff interests you!",

Equip energy defense parts and a rifle for quick cleanup. \n\nFighting a mech that shooting endless missiles? Bring the anti missile extensions and spec to shell defense while using a lightweight build to dodge and get in shots with your heat pistol and burn them from the inside. \n\nGoing into a rough terrain with a lake nearby? Bring the hover based leg parts so that you don't sink into the lake and die.\n\nAnd so on and so forth.

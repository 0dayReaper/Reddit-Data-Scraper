Obviously, some monsters still felt pretty cheap. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOyEgNPgRck) kind of details my feelings in better words.",

Just having a bit of the gameplay have something unique to the game to freshen it up a bit, awesome new monsters and I'm game to slash away with friends for a couple hundred hours.",

The other ones had all had great games in the early 2000s that were very modern for their times and then sequels that faltered before they got revitalized.\n\nOn the other hand, Megaman is an older franchise that's never really been \"modernized.\"  They've made new MegaMan games that people liked, but they were retro games meant to feel like the early MegaMan games.\n\nThe other series they've revitalized - Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter - all feel like they did it by polishing and modernizing them, borrowing from improvements to their respective genres made by other games, adding significant QoL, etc.  But doing that's a much harder job if they want to do it with MegaMan (rather than continuing to just make retro sequels aimed purely at fans of the old ones).",

Each one has a highly requested sequel (X9, ZX3, Legends 3), and if they made a sequel to any one of these subseries and any one of these core foundations got changed for the sake of \"revitalization/modernization\", not only it doesn't feel like their respective subseries, but it also doesn't really make those fans happy.\n\nMaking an entirely new subseries where they can freely explore new gameplay styles under the MegaMan IP is something they should have done a long time ago after MM11's release.",

Ignoring collections, there are only 5 games in the franchise that got past the 1 million sales mark (MegaMan 2, MegaMan 3, MegaMan X, MegaMan Battle Network 4, and the most recent MegaMan 11). Even though the 2000s era of MegaMan produced some of the franchise's finest work, it also caused the least amount of sales.\n\nThat's why Capcom is both hesitant to spend money on MegaMan games, and trying to make MegaMan an \"evergreen\" franchise, meaning the series would make some games that would sell over time rather than constantly making games for profit.",

Street Fighter, Monster Hunter, RE, and even DMC are all far more reliable franchises for them. \n\nWhen you see Dragons Dogma getting a sequel before Mega Man I tend to believe this.\n\nTo me MM never really escaped it's reputation of being a very difficult 2D platformer mostly catering to hardcore fans. And Battle Network is turn-based which is another hard sell. There are also no major handhelds  like the old days (except switch, which can already run things like TOTK) which is where franchises like Mega Man used to do well in.",

But I'd hate it if stuff like wirefalling returned for future games, or whatever the hell they did to the Hunting Horn.   \n  \nMHW had the perfect combat pace where it wasn't as slow as the old games but not as batshit as Rise either, and I'm really hoping the main team continues that instead of continuing down the road of fast fast fast fast.",

I don't necessarily want wirebugs to return for future games even if they are fun, definitely more of a one game experiment and wirefall can make fights too easy. But I have a huge problem with world's pacing too.\n\nIn early world it was far too easy to get the monster stunned for extended periods of time with flash pods, and while they fixed that as a stunlock exploit there's still way too much time spent wailing on downed monsters. Especially if you can flash or sonic pod them. And I think clutch claw is my least favorite monhun gimmick mechanic besides underwater combat, at least out of the ones I've played. It just feels like a chore, every so often I have to stop fighting the monster and tenderize, in addition to it adding yet another way that you can make the monster fall over. Plus monsters just randomly showing up and forcing you to stop and dung pod them got pretty annoying after initially seeing turf wars and thinking they're cool. If Rise is a monhun game that's too generous about keeping me in the action with wirefall, world is a monhun game where I feel like the action ends too quickly.",

It was vastly improved with Sunbreak, but still didn't quite do it for me. I'd therefore welcome a sequel that more directly builds upon World, rather than return to the more traditional design that Rise followed in some key aspects. If nothing else than for amazing visuals. World was at all times a pleasure to even just look at, whereas Rise felt quite visually dated and bland the same way the previous handheld entries did. That, and they tend to hold back on the whacky mechanics for the main line entries, such as Wirebugs and the stupidly annoying permabuffer system.",

Since it and DD2 are so close to each other I'm begging Capcom to release an event where I can fight a chimera or hydra in Monster Hunter with some DD armor as a reward.",

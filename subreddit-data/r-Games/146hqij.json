Gamefly, gamestop, or your local classifieds are very easy ways to find new games for cheap. If it's a short game you can treat it as a rental (which still exists if you wanted to go that way) and then quickly resell it for a small discount off retail prices then you've made out pretty well. It's pretty easy to buy a game for $70 and then sell it a week or two later for $60.  \n\n&gt;What I\u2019m getting at is if that\u2019s the reason you\u2019re holding on to your discs then that\u2019s insane lol, the most you\u2019re going to be \u201csaving\u201d or making is less than $100 most likely over the course of a decade of keeping these things on ur shelf\n\nIf you make up the argument you did that nobody else did then you could have a point",

The 3rd game in the trilogy will have discs as well, and so will the inevitable trilogy bundle.  They've made putting in those discs part of the nostalgia from the PS1 days.\n\nI also feel like digital only will be the norm pretty quickly here.

Even if I buy physical I'm bothered with the recent trend of AAA releases that require me to download a day 1 patch to even get the best experience. And most of update sizes are too big that I have to wait for hours. It's understandable as the games are getting bigger but I'm afraid this direction they're going for will not convince me to buy a new hardware anytime soon.",

There is still value as a consumer for physical sales, it\u2019s nice to have options of where to buy from, they run sales and compete. You know Diablo 4 is gonna sit at $70 on PSN, but Target is doing a B2G1 sale next week so you can grab it there. Or score big deals when a company decides to clear out a game.\n\nCombined with the fact that eventually the servers to download these games will turn off, it just sucks. Honestly with how non-functional games are without patches this point has less sticking to it, but still.",

While on consoles it has proven time, and time again they cannot manage to keep our libraries going on them without stripping a few or delisting them. Also bragging on them like its this huge feature to allow us to play games we bought from the previous console.\n\nI view this as a potential bad thing as it may even push more always online games with it. Physical copies have proven to be a better place for sales too, in many cases based on where you live. As the console makers hold a better grasp on their sales and how far they'll let products drop based on time going on via their own storefront. Last pro of physical is using it to download less from the internet if your internet speed isn't so great thus it'll hurt a few that are in these bad areas.\n\nBright side though less space used in homes and less waste of plastic. So I mean we do get some nice things with this too though.",

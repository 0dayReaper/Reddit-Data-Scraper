You see a lot of gamers criticise the Wii and DS for casualising Nintendo and killing their image but from a business point of view they were both genius. There's not really any room for Nintendo to budge in with a powerhouse of a home console any more. Avoiding the direct conflict with Sony and Microsoft and just setting up their own idea of what gaming is about was a great move and I reckon if they hadn't done that then the Wii (or whatever it might have been called) would have easily been another Gamecube (which isn't great sales wise).",

Realistically how many people do you think there are, dying to play Nintendo's first party games but holding off because of lack of 3rd party support. At the moment people just buy their consoles to compliment their other systems (be it PS4, XB1 or PC) and that probably wouldn't change if Nintendo made a powerhouse. It'd probably just mean less sales because people are still buying them as side systems except now they're more expensive so they're less likely to get them.\n\nThe main reason the GCN was profitable IIRC was because it was still sold for a profit. Nintendo probably couldn't afford to risk selling a powerhouse for a loss when there's not actually a particularly solid guarantee that it'd pay off. It'd be nice to see a powerhouse sure but you're essentially asking them to take a potentially company-killing risk to put it out.",

Really bad. He was gaunt and missing a lot of... Iwata-ness. I was really taken aback when we first saw him in person again.\n\nI hope he enjoyed his time in life and with Nintendo. Being a CEO can be incredibly stressful, and I hope some of that Nintendo magic filled at least some part of his life, the same way it did for many of us in childhood.",

He was connected to the process of game development and didn't just look at charts. I bet that he's one of the reasons Nintendo didn't compromise on their polish when it came to releasing games even in times of financial difficulty.\n\nHis loss is a loss to the industry, and the change in leadership at Nintendo could bring forth some turbulent times. I hope Nintendo continues its focus on the games and that it doesn't devolve into the worst of this industry.",

My parents bought me a new color Gameboy and Pokemon and for a little while each day I was able to forget how shitty my life was at that point.      \n      \nI fell off of Pokemon and I mostly PC game nowadays, but Nintendo will always have a special place in my heart.

IIRC transcripts of their board meetings have shown that many board members don't really get video games and ask a lot of questions that are essentially things like \"Why aren't we just shitting out F2P mobile games? They make lots of money don't they?\". Iwata has been rather outspoken about disliking this line of thought and as such has kept the company away from it for the most part. If the new CEO comes from within the company again (like how Iwata became the CEO after his long programming career there) then perhaps it'll stay like that but if they decide to bring in someone new or even just a younger mind who is more open to ideas like that then I could easily see it changing.",

            "comment": "I said this already on another site, but I feel like it needs to be said here as well:\n\nR.I.P, Iwata. You were a brave man, who brought some of the best memories to many people. You helped with many of the most recognizable games ever made like Mario to Zelda, to smaller titles that people still love to this very day, and will never forget the smiles and tears that they earned through playing. Through Animal Crossing you gave people a second life, a life that they enjoyed, a life that they loved, a life that they even mourned if they were to ever abandon it. But, if there was one thing I will never forget about you as a person, it\u2019s your eternal optimism. You never gave up on the Wii U, no matter how grim it\u2019s situation seemed, no matter how much people made fun of it and scoffed at it. You cared for Nintendo\u2019s consoles with pride, which is more than what I can say for many people, who would drop things in an instant. Because of this, we have some of the most memorable Nintendo games yet, like Bayonetta, W101, Splatoon, and even the Smash game that made history, bringing the greatest gaming icons ever in one place. You believed in Nintendo unlike anything ever seen before, and you earned the respect of many for it.\n\nIwata, you paved the future for Nintendo, and now it\u2019s time for them to keep moving foward, brighter than ever into the unknown. Only by doing so will your legacy live on. As long as Nintendo stands, you along with everyone else before you, will never be forgotten, so long as Nintendo never forgets that, above all else, they want to make the world a better place, by bringing joy through gaming, by bringing people together through them, and making memories people wouldn\u2019t trade for the world.\n\nAnd so, I end this with a quote from Splatoon:\n\n\u201cWhy are we here? For what purpose do we exist? We must not dwell on these questions. We can merely trust in the will of the universe and spend our days and nights in harmony with the world, celebrating this festival called Life.\u201d\n\nSo before we go back our festival of life, let\u2019s have a moment of silence for the people that made it more enjoyable. Thank you, Mr. Iwata.\n\n",

            "comment": "Without overexaggeration, he was one of the few men in that position in the industry that not only sold games but also made them. He actually knew what he was talking about and I don't care whether he was old-fashioned or not, I was always ready to understand when he asked me to. But there's no understanding to be had now... only sadness :c\n\nThis is a true loss, especially to his family of course, for Nintendo and gaming in general. He was the man who helped shape a lot of the franchises we love and revere to this day and who gave us smiles waiting for new games to come.\n\nYou will be missed, Iwata-san, you will be missed.",

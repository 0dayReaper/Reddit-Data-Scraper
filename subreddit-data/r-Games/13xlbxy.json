The problem was, that he also ran an import business which would bulk buy Nintendo games, import them and sell in Russia - circumventing the sanctions entirely.\n\nNintendo would have definitely been aware of this and would likely have turned a blind eye to it. Nintendo might have closed down business in Russia, but they were still technically selling there using this dodgy method.",

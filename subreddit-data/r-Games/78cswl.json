But with the rise in easily accessed, cheap PC games (Steam sales, Humble Bundles and the like), piracy too has been on a decline.\n\nEDIT: I'm well aware there are some games and cracks that let you play online with a pirated copy. But that isn't the case most of the time and when it is, it generally takes extra work and might involve some skills your average pirating player might not have.",

It was publishers noticing that the main games that weren't traded were the three or four main MP games in a given year, and deducing from that that every game needs MP because that stops people trading it in. Behold! Dozens of developers all around the globe are contractually forced to waste large percentages of their dev budget on shoehorned-in MP modes that nobody ever gave a shit about except aforementioned publishers.

Basically every single Fps since the first Quake has had multiplayer and I can tell you that the many many people that spent weekends having  lans with their friends playing multiplayer Quake for years after its release sure as hell never complained that it was a waste of time.  The first Age of Empires had multiplayer and just like Quake, it's a game that was super popular well beyond its years. It's only natural that we went from multiplayer over local area network cables to multiplayer over the internet. I can't think of many PC games besides games from the Zork era that didn't have multiplayer of some sort. It's always been a thing and it's always been requested by fans. And I say this as someone who personally doesn't enjoy multiplayer. This just simply sounds false to me. ",

If you offer your games cheaper at your own online store (PSN/Xbox), the retailer will most likely not offer your hardware on shelves/at their online stores(Best Buy/Amazon). The retailer wants a cut on the games, which won't happen if they are cheaper online. The retailer couldn't be bothered with consoles then. To keep a company afloat, follow-up costs have to be set in place.",

This is huge considering kids and people who aren't particularly tech savvy.\n\n2) Optimization. Games for consoles generally run really well since there's a defined hardware for them. You buy a game for console, and you can be almost positive it will run smoothly.\n\n3) Price/performance. Kind of related to point one, really. Nowadays, the price/performance isn't *awful* on consoles. Can you build a PC for cheaper? Yeah, sure. But, it's going to require deal hunting and kind of knowing what you're doing, which brings us back to point 1.",

Just make sure to add a multiplayer mode\". I'm sorry I can't source it, but I don't think it should be hard to find on YouTube. I can try to look for it later when I have more time.\n\nEdit: thanks to /u/Piemonkey for reminding me of the source: [Spec Ops: The Line... Five Years Later](https://youtu.be/8dzstxE_5Rc).",

The base game had very little content and they released dlc to make up for it so by the time the game was worth 60 it cost 110. \n\nBut something like Witcher 3 does dlc perfectly. The base game is absolutely worth 60 and the dlc are side stories with new maps and enemies and other content. I think people want to see more dlc like that in games. Having a new map and a mini story for doom in the vein of the old blood would be awesome.",

Its easier to validate the purchase of a game on the off chance that you like its multiplayer enough that you keep coming back to it. \n\nA 10hr SP campaign is harder to stomach knowing you can beat it in a weekend and see everything it has to offer. You start telling yourself you can wait for a sale since you wont miss anything waiting compared to an online game which may have your friends pressuring you to play with them. Or you start thinking about the idea of renting the game for 2$ and beating it.\n\nEither way games cost a lot of money and its hard from a purchase decision standpoint a lot of arguments get in the way of dropping 60$ on something you may only play for a few hours total before its completely spent.\n\n",

I thought I never say something like this, but I am happier with a short and polished experience without MP like Hellblade than all the games I have sitting on my shelf, I won't ever finish half of the campaign and will never touch the MP. On the other hand, I invested a buttload of time into Titanfall 2 Multiplayer. I wish games would concentrate on their strengths than try to mask their weaknesses.

Give me the ability to play all those Smash fighting games genre (the one with a character named Zettaburn orsomething like that) online, but also by giving my IRL friend a controller.\n\nImagine playing Ratchet and Clank co-op with 4 people. Imagine depending on the number of people you have the level changes, and maybe even drastically. Give me a story based game that has replayability. Have me and my 3-8 other buddies play Ratch and Clank over and over again so we can grind up for the RHINO. Make it so every restart of the game has different generation maybe, who knows. \n\nWe need co-op again. I always find it so sad we cannot do that anymore and it is one thing I sorely miss since I switched to PC. I don't want to worry or Google-fu if a game supports co-op or how to. I want to play a game at my own pace and sometimes just throw a controller at my friends without worrying about online strangers and objectives that have been rinsed and repeated in other games. ",

Attackers could also blow-up the wall at the sewage weakpoint, like the movie, for an extra route to take. Defenders could blow the horn of Gondor (took a minute to climb all the way up to it) to call in an artillery strike to disable the tank every few minutes. Good map to get \"[goombas](https://i.imgur.com/mRqy6jJ.gifv)\" on (landing on an opponent's head for an instant kill). Crazy fun.",

I finally got around to playing it a couple of weeks ago and man was it good. Only took 15 hours to complete but the story was great and the shooter mechanics were super fun.\n\nThen last weekend I picked up Old Blood and played that through as well. Slightly more \"grounded\" than NO and closer to the paranormal weirdness of RtCW than the Iron Skies-esque sci-fi alternate universe of NO but still heaps of fun.\n\nReally excited for NC now.",

A longer development cycle, and lower amount of game modes means there was probably a much smaller development team. Even if they add a year of development, the money they save on staff is probably massive.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is it is most likely financially viable to do big AAA single player games today, it's just not conducive to how the big studios operate anymore. They aren't spending 2-3 full years on a title with a smaller core development team, they are going 18-20 months with 1k+ staff to pump out a game for a certain release window.\n\nI know that sounds bad, but it's clearly making them a lot of money so why stop? EA isn't going to shift development to slower releases and smaller staff to make the same or less money. Why would they?\n\nI know that single player AAA games aren't going away. I think it's complete hyperbole to think that. I don't know why people were expecting AAA single player games from EA anymore. They made it pretty damn clear years ago that they were done in that department and that's fine. Plenty of other developers out there.\n\nIf anything this opens up the market a little bit for smaller developers. The market for AAA single player is still there and if EA isn't fucking it up with horrible Mass Effect launches, that leaves room for other devs to make better games.",

I appreciate the fact that some devs add in multiplayer to their games to try something new and give the player more choices, but in my mind, if the dev wants to focus soley on the single player experience I back it 100%. They proved themselves to know how to craft a fun exciting  single player experience with the new order and the old blood and I am really excited to see what they've done with this one. ",

            "comment": "It's a weird industry we're in when this might be seen as unusual or somehow controversial.  Development teams do not have infinite time (even if they somehow had infinite money), and any amount of time and effort devoted to a half-assed multiplayer mode \"because it's gotta have multiplayer!\" will necessarily take resources away from something else in the game.  DOOM's multiplayer wasn't *bad*, but what could we have gotten *instead* of that lukewarm multiplayer mode?\n\nIf you have a narrative-focused, single-player game and don't have any intention of putting in multiplayer (whether co-op or competitive), but don't feel like extra effort on the existing single-player would make much of a difference... know what I'd love?  Fucking Mercenaries mode.  It's something the Resident Evil series began adding in starting with Resident Evil 3 (though I think it became popularized with RE4, given that game's stronger emphasis on action) and it's a hugely popular part of all of the core titles.  It also seems like something that shouldn't take a huge amount of development time and it does add a lot of play time to a game, if that's a concern.\n\nIn most cases, though, I'd say \"modding tools\" would be my number one request for virtually any and every single-player game.  If the game is accessible to modders (particularly if the tools are simple to learn even for \"non-modders\"), then it *doesn't matter* if the player thinks something could've done better... because they can fix it themselves.  Probably 80% of my playtime in XCOM2 is with mods, many of them homemade (the layout of the game files is simple enough that you can do quite a lot even without installing ModBuddy) and the lack of mods or accessibility for modding is probably the only big knock I have with this year's Prey.",

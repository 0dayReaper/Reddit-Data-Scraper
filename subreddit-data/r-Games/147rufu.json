Given the number of countries that have approved the deal, the concessions Microsoft is willing to give, and the fact that the FTC has yet to get any real judicial backing, it's going to be a hell of a struggle to block this at every judicial level. Regardless of what you think about this acquisition and how it finally ends, if anything it certainly shows how limited the power of regulating agencies actually is.",

Deals are effectively \"lost\" if an injunnction is issued. So if the FTC gets an injunction the Activision acquisition is dead.",

The idea that the government would actually block an acquisition these days in any industry just feels alien.\n\nShould it be blocked?  I think so though probably not for the reasons that the FTC or the UK's trade commission are concerned about.  For me, I just see this as making it open season for large publishers to be bought up.  Bethesda was alarming enough.  I don't think the market is better off for it.",

We're not far off from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo having significant ownership in all relevant game development entities and that's a very dangerous road, we already see the signs where these companies do ridiculously stupid things (monetization strategies are the most obvious ones) and we have no choice but to accept it or abandon huge subsets of gaming.",

They wanted expertise consultants for live services, which means either buying or leasing that help. So they went with an option that is profitable in the long run on top of getting the expertise they want. \n\nBungie was not bought for their studio, games or franchises. Bungie still owns the rights to Destiny 2, Sony can't force them to go exclusive nor can they force them to work on specific games. It was an extremely favourable deal as far as Bungie is concerned.",

This is unprecedented, weird and kinda off-putting. The only reason Microsoft buys them is so that they justify rising the price of Gamepass and finally become profitable, which no one benefits from but them. Honestly, I doubt they really know what they\u2019re doing. The whole thing is a play on hypothetical hyper-growth, which isn\u2019t really happening.

They don't compete, they bribe.

If you're a game pass customer, getting a game on game pass vs paying full price is a no-brainer. \n2. Once you've been a customer for a while and many games you enjoy are now tied to your game pass subscription, you're less likely to cancel or you'd lose those games. \n3. Which means you're more likely to get the next game you want on game pass instead of buying it outright, since it's not like you're cancelling gamepass anyway.\n4. Which means you're even less likely to cancel in the future and so on and so forth.\n\nSo it really really incentivises customer retention because customers don't really have a good way of moving to a competitor, the cost is too high. This will lead to them getting more and more market share over time as the flow of customers is very one-way. Unless they fuck it up, of course.",

Games don't get tied to your account in any way, you just play them when you have an active subscription. If anything the most incentivised thing is getting a month of GP, playing through whatever game you're interested in, and then cancelling. Rinse and repeat whenever another big game comes out or there's a few smaller ones you think you'll like. That's the opposite of incentivising customer retention. \n\nYour theory only really works if people are constantly playing a game they're getting from GP and don't want to lose access to it, but I'm struggling to see why that would be the case since it's not really like there's any major live service games that are on it, and for single player games people will play through them and then drop them for something else.",

They throw all of their games into Game Pass (GP) making it a buffet of games. Who would go to any of the competition if you could have the best games at your fingertips with no real loss for the consumer. You hear how great High-Fi Rush is well, you already have a subscription to GP, might as well try it out. Why buy Xbox games if you can get every exclusive (and more) for free? \n\n&gt;It's similar to my issue with the Epic Games Store. They don't compete by having a product with advantages over the competition, they literally buy out developers to only release on their store. EGS has market share because it bribes developers with fat stacks of cash, and it bribes gamers with free games, but its actual store and app are both complete garbage. They don't compete, they bribe. That's just as bad.\n\nI feel the exact same about Game Pass. Microsoft is bringing trash bags of money to devs and buying their loyalty. Sure you can get it on PlayStation but why? Why buy into an ecosystem when you could buy an Xbox for $300-500, Xbox gold and Game Pass? If they wanted to compete they would just do what Sony does make exclusive games instead of buying up all of these companies and making their games exclusive. Could the games be on other platforms? Absolutely if they install a Microsoft product on their device. \n\nSony's approach is: Buy exclusivity which in and of itself is bad. They're bringing a bag of money to a dev and, (likely), partially funding the game for exclusive rights. \n\nMicrosoft's approach is: Buy exclusive rights for preferred treatment on their console. Not to mention a constant reminder that it's available for a small fee on the competition. \n\nI think about it like this: it's like if you went to the store and the grocery store sold both Coke and Pepsi but when you first walked in the door the cashiers are all wearing Pepsi hats and every time you walked around somebody constantly said: \"Hey have you got your Pepsi today?\" Or the cashier reminds you that you can get a free case of Pepsi with your grocery store membership.\n\nNot to mention that [Microsoft still buys timed exclusively as well.](https://www.gamesradar.com/stalker-2-guide/) Only reason people don't make a stink about it is because the timed exclusively are on games with low fanfare. I guarantee if it was something like Ken Levine's Judas the argument would be different. \n\n&gt;At least in the past exclusives had an excuse of hardware-based development limitations, because years ago games were catered to the console hardware they would be on. That's no longer the case; exclusivity in today's age is affected by company ownership and little else, and that's why things like exclusivity are a bigger deal today than in the past.\n\nI agree with this. My only contention is Square. I argued on another thread that one of the reasons that Square is so loyal to Sony is because Sony practically saved their ass with Final Fantasy 7. That's the kind of loyalty that's really hard to buy. I think Bungie probably feels the same way about Microsoft. My hypothesis is why even though Bungie is owned by Sony, there had to be a deal worked out where they could also be on Xbox not to mention PC.",

Nobody can argue that Sony hasn't had the better exclusive for the best part of 10 years, and it's given them a huge lead in the market share. Microsoft's way of being competitive is to provide a service that has incredible value as an alternative to the \"pay $70 for every new release we put out\". \n\nIt's just ridiculous to say it's anticompetitive, it's like saying Sony has been anticompetitive by making their games too good.",

I view it as anticompetitive because it's not doing things the traditional way. Because Microsoft has money they're buying up exclusive rights to have everything day one on their platform. Plus they own one of the most prominent former third part publishers: Bethesda or more importantly Zenimax. Every 1st party game shown at their conference was from a former 3rd party studio that they bought and made exclusive. Hell every exclusive game they released this year was from a Bethesda owned studio. High-Fi Rush, Redfall and soon Starfield. All will be coming to \"Game Pass day one\"  If it wasn't for Bethesda, Microsoft wouldn't have Jack this year. If Microsoft buys Activision - Blizzard and makes all of their games available day one on GP why would anyone own a PlayStation other than exclusives. \n\nLook at it this way: say apple went out and bought Disney not going to happen but bear with me. So Apple announces that every single Disney owned content available is available for free on iPhones through Apple TV. Why the hell would I go to the theater to see Avatar when I can just watch it on Apple TV in the comfort of my own home? Not to mention Apple TV would have ESPN for free, all of the Hulu, Disney+ content and every season on The Simpsons all available for $60 (or so) a year. Would that be anti consumer? I mean I can still buy access to Hulu, ESPN and see Disney flicks in the theater but why would I when I can get it for a monthly fee? Better yet, why in the world would I own an Android if I get all of that for free on an iPhone? \n\nThat's why the FTC is so alarmed, they see Microsoft becoming a behemoth and they're wanting to stop it ASAP. Now if Microsoft built up those studios from scratch and made them into powerhouses like Sony did then the conversation would be different. Yes I realize that Sony didn't *actually* make Insomniac or Naughty Dog. But they made them who they are today. Where would Insomniac be without Ratchet and Clank, The Spiro Games and Resistance? All made popular on Sony's console. Same with Naughty Dog would Uncharted be a thing if it wasn't for Sony? The Last of Us?",

Sure you'll never put Nintendo out of business but you don't have to. All you have to do is make the competition look so weak that you cast doubts on their ability to produce. We need to look at that long term. Let's take 10 years from now. Let's pretend that by this time super fast internet is available everywhere by then with no lag at all.  Hypothetically Microsoft would have the advantage over the competition by being first and the best offering by leveraging their studios, (and money), to muscle their way into burying the competition. By having all of their studios put their games on their service day one, and many, many other 3rd party studios what other competitive advantage does Sony or Nintendo have? Microsoft will own COD, Diablo, Overwatch, Halo and Bethesda games. Not to mention inExile, Obsidian, Double Fine, and others. You can stream it to your phone, [your fridge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514030/microsoft-xcloud-samsung-smart-fridge-doom-enternal-xbox-games-android) or even computer with no lag. \n\nThe best way I can explain it is like this remember the [AMD versus Intel lawsuit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices,_Inc._v._Intel_Corp) What Intel was doing was they were having computer companies put their chips on computers instead of AMD. Every single commercial you saw forever was Intel inside\u2122. That gave him Intel a huge competitive advantage over the competition. So much so that everyone believed that AMD wasn't as good. Did what they do was illegal? Absolutely not. Was it underhanded? Yes. It put AMD on the back for foot years, and I'd argue it still is.",

The idea that Microsoft is going to come in and clean house just doesn't make much sense when they also have their own internal culture issues.\n\nThese aren't distressed assets, ActiBliz is making a killing and Microsoft is going to want to continue that train. Especially since they're buying this company to plug the gaps in their first party output.",

They've also requested a temporary restraining order to stop Microsoft from closing the deal while the court decides on the request for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThey requested that the restraining order be filed before 8:59pm(PT) on Thursday, implying that Microsoft was planning to close the deal by as early as Friday.\n\n**TL;DR** Microsoft is planning on closing the ABK acquisition soon. FTC wants to delay until the hearing in August.",

If they're confident in their legal argument, this only pushes the date forward and potentially removes the FTC as a blockade. I'm also like 90% sure that the CMA will backtrack on their initial decision as well given the state of politics over there.  \n\n\nI'm still pretty much leaning towards this deal going through, it's just a question of how long and bloody the road is going to be.  \n\n\nIn regards to whether I think it's a **good** thing or not? I'm... kind of on the fence. I'm not exactly a fan of the big 3 being able to scoop up whoever they want, and we're slowly losing more and more independent strongholds. On the other hand, Acti-Blizz and its products and employees could actually benefit from being under Microsoft. On top of that, if this deal falls through, someone else will absolutely try to swoop in and make the purchase... and I highly doubt the company that does it will be any better than MS.  \n\n\nRegardless of all that though, I really just want this to be over with. One way or another, this deal needs to either be confirmed or denied. I'm sick of hearing about it in the news, it's stirring up the console fanboys and I'm sick to death of the people defending their plastic box like they owe Sony/Microsoft money and are desperate to lower the bill.",

Activision Blizzard is one of the biggest publishers worldwide and owns the single-biggest third party franchise with Call of Duty. If they had nothing else but Call of Duty, that would be cause for concern. But they also own multiple other franchises, including Blizz stuff like Diablo, Warcraft, etc.\n\nAllowing this purchase to go through would utterly change the landscape of console gaming in Microsoft's favor if they were to make the properties Activision Blizzard owns Xbox exclusive. Anyone who believes otherwise is an absolute fucking moron.",

                    "comment": "Hi it's me a moron. I not only think the purchase of Activision blizzard will not really change the landscape of console gaming, it is not even in MSFTs primary scope of the purchase. Console gaming is a stagnant market, Microsoft is looking towards the future.\n\nCoD is certainly a big 3rd party and would become a console seller if it became exclusive, but keeping things exclusive to Xbox hasnt been its strategy for a while. Anything released on Xbox is released on PC and can likely be played through Game pass day 1, maybe even streamed through XCloud. There is very little reason to purchase an Xbox nowadays vs PS5 or Switch, and it'll stay that way even with ATVI purchase. Phil Spencer himself admitted recently in a podcast that they already lost the console war when they lost market share during the generations gamers built up their digital libraries.\n\nThe real reasons MSFT is looking to buy out ATVI:\n\n- Game pass: Microsoft currently owns the Netflix of game subscription/streaming services. And similarly to Netflix, competitors are building out their own subscription/streaming services and 3rd party IP is getting divided up. Microsoft loses many attractive 3rd party titles from their library every month, and its 1st party IP is getting more and more lackluster. Content is king for these types of platforms, and Microsoft needs to get as many 1st party attractors to keep game pass on top.\n\n- Live service: Sony is known for its single player first party titles and even they're making the shift to live service games as the majority of its portfolio. Amazons gaming division almost exclusively invests into live service titles. Activision runs one of the largest and longest lasting live service titles in the world in WoW. If Microsoft wants more investment in this space that serves as a cash cow if successful, then the WoW teams expertise would prove incredibly useful in building out those avenues.\n\n- Mobile: an often overlooked aspect of Activision Blizzard is that they own King, the makers of candy crush. Mobile gaming is proving to be the leading revenue generator among all platforms in the gaming industry, especially in eastern markets. Microsoft doesn't really have a mobile gaming footprint, so getting King will definitely accelerate any ambitions Microsoft has in that market.",

You can still play Call of Duty just fine if you happen to own a gaming PC or decide to make one! See, it's not exclusive at all!\n\nDo you hear how fucking silly that sounds?

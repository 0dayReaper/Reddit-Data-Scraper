You aren't just searching for ammo crates or running up to shelves and pressing a button to 'search' them.  You can actually get up close and personal with in game assets and rummage through them.  Developers have much more freedom to pack their environments with *meaningful* density that isn't just a facade, and the player is freed to pay much closer attention to the environment.\n\nIt is also very challenging to get right though.  It isn't enough to just be able to interact with objects, devs need to consider what that object does, and how it reacts to other objects.  Many VR games take it half way, but few take it all the way.  For example, it's great that you can walk up to a dining table and pick up a fruit from a bowl and a knife, but what happens when you try to use the knife on the fruit?  In most games, nothing.  What we want to achieve in VR is getting to a point where you can cut the fruit, even if there is no reason to really do so.  I am really hoping Valve got this right.",

He is basically crawling through sewers to escape the city and is being helped by other resistance members all the time. Add to that the fact that he is basically a pawn, who is SOLD OFF to the highest bidder by the G-Man. His survival instincts are simply so strong that he seems to just...get through anything. But he did not end up in City 17 because he wanted to be a hero or kill all Combine. He had no idea what was going on but the G-Man knew he would be useful. The right man in the wrong place.",

I know most people won't care about such particularities, but for me, just the way that you search for and pick up items in a game can make it way more immersive. That's why I absolutely love the style of Deus Ex where you have to physically open drawers and cabinets to reach items inside compared to modern action RPGs where you are presented with an inventory.",

Usually you hold a button on the controller and then you see a marker/cursor that shows where you will teleport to. You can move the cursor with the controller and then release the button to teleport. This is the best at avoiding weird motion feelings but obviously has limitations over full quick movement control.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmooth locomotion is probably just filtered / limited movement speed so that it's less likely to make yourself sick by moving the joysticks around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Valve has a better explanation of their \"Shift\" movement mode on the site. Basically seems like teleporting but with smooth motion between the two points:  [https://half-life.com/en/alyx/vr](https://half-life.com/en/alyx/vr)",

We expect these problems to be resolved as we update firmware and drivers over the next few weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Steam Link currently doesn't stream from Macs. An upcoming update will add full support for streaming audio, video, and controller input.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Steam Controller doesn't currently support gamepad emulation on Macs. If you opt into the Steam Beta client, keyboard/mouse emulation will be functional. We expect gamepad emulation to become functional within a few weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; We want to apologize for the delays in providing full functionality for the Mac platform. We're doing everything we can to resolve the issues. For the latest fixes and functionality, we recommend that you opt in to the Steam client beta.\n&gt; \n&gt; We've added the Valve Complete Pack to your Steam account as a gift from Valve. **This will give you all of Valve's games (past, present and future) free of charge**. You can still choose to refund your Steam Controller and/or Steam Link (refund instructions below), but the Valve games are yours to keep.\n&gt; \n&gt; Steam Hardware Team\"\n\nThe last statement implies that my account will receive the Valve Complete Pack, which will include all future games to be released by Valve, including the newly announced Half-Life: Alyx.

Half-Life is fantastic on its own, of course, but its modding community is legendary thanks to Valve's extensive support and famous tendency to hire high-quality modders to develop their products into full, polished games and and franchises. The first Half-Life game gave us Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, the second gave us Portal and Garry's Mod, and those are just the big ones. And obviously there will almost certainly be projects to make HL:A at least partially playable with a normal keyboard and mouse setup.\n\n2020 is gonna be an amazing year for PC gaming.",

People's descriptions of it being cryptic and hard to understand is also grossly overblown. Unless you're refusing to listen to audio logs, it tells you very readily where to goa and what to do",

That includes writing stuff down on paper and occasionally looking up guides. Not all information is available via voice logs and even then you'll have to scroll through to find the correct sector for it, then click each one individually until you find the information you need. I mean the reactor code will require 30+ minutes of backtracking through empty levels if you didn't write down the randomized number from each cpu node.\n\nEdit: take my advice and write it down. I started an episode of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown and saw that by the time I found each cpu node again, 25 minutes had passed. If you wait until the end, Shodan spawns new enemies on each floor to guard the cpu nodes. And even if there were no enemies, it still takes 3-4 minutes to get to each floor, cpu room, then back to the elevator. Do that 6 times and you're obviously pushing 20-25 minutes if you're just running in and out. This is assuming you remember exactly where each cpu room is, since the maps don't directly mark it. You can also do certain \"missions\" out of order so if you're like me you'll have no reason to revisit storage, medical, or research by the end besides getting the number code.",

When it's time to go down to the Reactor again you'll get a message about the codes so that you can collect them on the way down.

It's more like 5 min tops.",

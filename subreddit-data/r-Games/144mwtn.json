            "comment": "If there was ever a perfect example of a game that deserves a **remake** not because it *was* good but because it *could* have been good, thus deserving a second chance, it's this game. The original release is in no way a terrible game, but anyone remotely familiar with the history of the game's development will know about its squandered potential. I'm fairly certain Suda51 even included a sub-plot in Travis Strikes Again about how EA pretty much ruined the project. I doubt anyone who played  the original (even those who liked it, which includes me) has ever felt the need to replay it.\n\nIf it's not a remake, why bother?",

It's a criticism of EA's CEO back in 2011 - John Riccitiello. The guy that largely ruined Shadows of the Damned. \n\nThe villain of TSA is Dr. Juvenile, an overly passionate game developer (Suda51 parallel) who becomes a tragic anti-villain due to getting screwed over by Damon Riccitiello - the TRUE evil villain and CEO of the fictional \"Utopinia Corporation\".\n\nDamon Riccitiello returns as the true antagonist of NMH3. He's literally a criticism of John Riccitiello.",

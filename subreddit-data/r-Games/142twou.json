I personally thought it was great. Game was always forcing you to switch your play based on the situation. It made you think about what type of enemy you were fighting and how to set up your loadout accordingly. On top of being quite execution intensive too. It hit this perfect sweet spot for me between strategy and execution and passing stages with your own tailormade combos felt really satisfying. Terrific aesthetics, decent story, the fun memory rewrite gimmick, just a satisfying single player experience front to back. Nice game to 100% too.",

But when you took those combos into combat, you'd always find that you had to dodge mid-combo, lose your combo, and as a result never actually use the combo system or the custom combos that you came up with.\n\nYes, I know it was possible to keep your combo by dodging towards an opponent to flip over them, but it required such incredibly precisely aimed stick tilts that it was basically impossible and most players never discovered it was possible. Even when they knew about it players found it hard/impossible to actually pull it off. I remember people saying that the only reason they knew it was possible was because there were videos on the net demonstrating the move.\n\nI'm sure there was some bug that made the target window for this kind of dodge one pixel wide instead of the 30 degrees (or whatever) that it was supposed to be.",

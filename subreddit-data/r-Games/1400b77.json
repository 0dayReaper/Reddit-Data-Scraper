Every Sunday I get on and block out all the indie devs that post their shovelware so I can see normal post and never have to see their specific post again.\n\nWould be a lot easier if there was just a filter to block out all these \"indie game\" post.\n\nA giant game company could decide to close shop and I'd never see the post on here because i'm too busy wading through \"so and so here, new developer releasing our demo of a game to release in 2034 (never) based on games X and Y\"",

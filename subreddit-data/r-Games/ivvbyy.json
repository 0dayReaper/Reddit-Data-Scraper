Highest I think I've seen has been The Wolf Among Us with 60%, but I do have some in my mind that I know for sure had like 70% but I can't remember the titles.\n\nGames like Tomb Raider, Dishonored, Devil May Cry 5, etc. all have 40%+ completion rate on Steam.\n\nSome people claim that 20-30% is the average completion rate, but that's for big games like Witcher 3, and somewhat cheap indie games that are thrown around in Humble Bundles and free giveaways. The average completion rate for quality games (quality indie, AA, AAA, etc) is around 35-45%.",

Story focused games are going to have a higher completion rate than non story focused games, open worlds that are 60+ hours are going to be the same\n\nWitcher 3 specifically is only at a 30.3% completion rate for finishing the game on any difficulty. Don't hate me but I didn't complete it and don't know exactly but rescuing dandelion I'm pretty sure is a plot point you cannot miss and only 40% have done that, so the vast majority who put a certain amount of time into the game have completed it. \n\nPersonally in these wide open world style games, I prefer a shorter main quest with huge amounts of well written side stories. A 12 hour story with an additional 30-40 hours of side quests suits me much better as long as they're well done",

I wonder if it's witcher 3 fans testing out an older game and not being happy with it.\n\nI was kind of thinking the same thing so I put the achievement statistics page into the Wayback Machine and (surprisingly) got alot of archives.  In [Nov of 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20111101051908/https://steamcommunity.com/stats/TheWitcher2/achievements) the completion rate was 29.4%. [2 years later]  (https://web.archive.org/web/20131102100358/http://steamcommunity.com/stats/TheWitcher2/achievements/) it dropped to 17.2%. In [late April of 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150421024736/http://steamcommunity.com/stats/TheWitcher2/achievements), a few weeks before the release of The Witcher 3, the completion rate was 15%.\n\nI've checked some of the data points between the release of the Witcher 3 and today, and the completion rate is more or less an upwards trend, which surprised me.",

Hyrule castle wasn't even really a dungeon either, more of just a gauntlet.  Even Majora's Mask had more than that even if some were kinda small.\n\nIt's obvious they spent a ton of their time/puzzle budget on the Shrines, and they were fun, but I would've much preferred, say, 60 shrines with much larger dungeons.",

I also think the inciting incident of TLOU2 is so impactful that it makes people really, really want to see how it\u2019s resolved.",

Took me almost a year after Hearts of Stone to play Blood and Wine, because at that point the gameplay loop had already worn thin. However, I later did finish Blood and Wine, and it is indeed quite good. But contrary to most people, I consider Hearts of Stone to be superior by a wide margin. It's incredibly well-paced with excellent characters, memorable from beginning to end, and both endings are equally brilliant.\n\nBaW, on the other hand, is a very \"upper-class\" kind of story, essentially a court drama with a murder mystery thrown in. It's a lot of fun, but it rarely connected with me emotionally, probably because I didn't find the new characters particularly interesting or fascinating. In fact, many of them are wealthy, privileged dipshits, and the game seems to presume the player is emotionally invested in their squabbles, which I personally wasn't. The characters I was more interested in don't get as much attention, and the whole story gets a bit rushed towards the end. The dots don't connect as smoothly as they do in HoS.",

They're skipping the song because they don't like the music as much or they're giving up on that show because it's not compelling enough. \n\nWith video games the cost of entry is much higher so a good margin of people are probably buying them because they want to see the art through, but only a small percentage will actually finish it due to the time commitment. \n\nFor video games it's probably difficult for studios to justify further production costs and development time for additional content that only a small fraction of people who actually play the game will ever see. So for example, in The Witcher 3 that could be like choosing to not render all of their endings because people are going to have drastically different experiences by the end.",

On the other hand pretty much all of my friends that also happen to be gamers had similar experience, and found pacing basically perfect and game itself extremely addictive, including people who never really played any RPGs before (or even didn't really play games before as such and wanted to see what this cultural phenomenon is about).",

I dunno, I feel like I'm one of the few people that doesn't value replayability at all, and I feel like whenever a game uses that as a selling point, it's a red flag that there's not much content to it. \n\nLike, the reality is, any game that has \"choice matters\" is still going to boil down into 2 or 3 vaguely similar endings that all cover virtually the same events and story beats, it's not like the game is THAT much different between one choice or another. \n\nLike, I'd say that New Vegas Emphasizes choice a lot, but no matter what, you still recruit or defeat all the groups, you still end up on the Hoover Dam, you still fight the legion. \n\nIdk. I like having choices in games, but not when it's touted as a reason to replay the game, when it boils down to maybe 30 minutes of new content in a 40 hour play-through.",

I love a challenge in games, I usually crank up the difficulty to keep me engaged, but in Witcher it's just makes things way longer than they need to be.\n\nAll the enemies become damage sponges, taking what felt like twice as many hits to kill. And they also one shot you, so you constantly need to ha e Quen applied, so if you get hit by one of the 5 spiders that are spitting at you, you don't really have much of choice but to dance around waiting for you mana to come back, or risk dying and sitting on the load screen. So in my expression, Death March made me play the same way I played on the Hard difficulty, but just taking way longer.\n\nImo, every game should have taken notes from Kingdom Hearts' Critical Mode. Enemies hit harder, are smarter, and you get less mana to spam certain powerful moves, but on the other hand, it gives you more damage, and gives you more moves at the start of the game, rewarding more skillful play with faster more intense combat.",

            "comment": "According to Steam, only 26% of owners of The Witcher 3 beat the game. Since platform holders started releasing stats on trophies/achievements, seems like only about 1/4 - 1/3 of gamers finish the games they own, the only exceptions I've seen are Sony exclusives which usually cross the 50% threshold. I think thats b/c Sony exclusives have a campaign that last between 15-25 hours, plus maybe only 10-15 hours worth of sidequests. Seems like this might be the sweet spot for most gamers.",

If a game is 100 hours then odds are i will have real life get in the way and when i come back to it i forgot where i was, what the story was, etc. To me seeing a game is 100 hours isn't a good thing, it's a negative one. You don't need 300 tv show episodes worth of gameplay for a good story",

If it's as long as Witcher 3, also great.  \n\nBut to let *completion rate* of all things, something that is notoriously low even for short straightforward narrative-based games like Uncharted, dictate the length of your story....that's a red flag for me, and makes me worried about the narrative quality.",

If you had data to back this assumption of, fine - but the reasons why people don't finish games are widespread. \nOne of them is, that some devs put a lot of time and effort into the first few hours of a game and then the quality degenerates.\nThey say it's because players often don't play beyond that time but I don't know if that's more of a chicken and egg problem.",

I think they didn't know what do to with Ciri as a character (since the main quest is really about her), so they tried to keep her and Geralt seperate for as long as possible.\n\nBlood &amp; Wine and Heart of Stone had some really tight plotting tho, with honestly even better quests than the main game, so I think they know where they went wrong.\n\nAnd maybe they'll do something similar to Bethesda games where they have longer \"sidequests\" with the various factions, so you have more to do post campaign in the open world.",

The response was vague and noncommital.\n\nI really like that this question was asked. I don't think the details of plot or worldbuilding were known to most of the board but at least now they do know and how ironic it is.",

The idea that we should be aiming to pay workers as much as possible... ie. We want the people doing the work to be prosperous!  I'm not sure if that every really caught on.\n\nSomehow, the goal of paying high wages disappears. The wages got re-identified as a generic 'cost' - which must then be minimised. The goal of a company is to maximise the profits of the owners. Everything, and _everyone_ else is just a resource to be squeezed and exploited as ruthlessly as possible to maximise those profits.",

Lafferty points out that the fraction of intact host energy spent on reproduction includes not just gonads and gametes but also secondary sexual characteristics, mate-seeking behavior, competition, and care for offspring. Infected hosts may have a different appearance, lacking said sex characteristics and sometimes even devoting more energy to growth, resulting in giganticism.[4] Poulin suggests that prolonged host life may also result from parasitic castration, benefiting the parasite.[3]",

And, sometimes, you honestly don't even realize how fucked up you've allowed for things to get until they are already there.\n\nWorking on Infinite, our crunch was ... exhausting. Well, the second crunch at least. The first crunch wasn't so bad, but only because it ended fairly early by them just altering the scope of the game down to what we should actually have time for. Or so they said. That still lead to 8 months of us working, at the start 12 to 14 hours days, 6 days a week. Towards the end it got to the point where enough of the employees were missing the literal last train home that they chartered a bus to simply follow the route and take us home that way. Looking back, that's so horrific. We were literally getting in at 8 AM every morning and working until well past midnight when the last train left. That. is. insane. But when you are actually in that position and get the email that there will now be chartered busses for those who have to stay past midnight, all you actually feel is relief that you are no longer stressing to get everything done by that previous, non-negotiable deadline and not seeing it for just the simply ploy that we were now literally working until 1 AM or 2 AM some nights. \n\nOh, and, obviously we were feed for every meal. They had tons of 'de-stress' events and organizations. They made an effort to at least make the experience comfortable which is far more than I can say happens for some other companies. But at the end of the day, all the bonuses, and pampering, and parties that they might throw for you doesn't really matter for much when you realize you've literally give them over your life and don't really have much of a family or friends to speak of. Just co-workers whom you hopefully enjoy, because otherwise you have no chance of surviving. \n\nSo ... yeah, fuck all of them, because even the 'nice ones' are still shit. All of them crunch, every last one. And that's where they really get you. Getting on projects like I'm sure Cyberpunk was are killers man, because you know you're working on a game that's gonna be memorable, epic even, and you know it has the potential to be awesome and amazing, but they'll drag your soul out to pay for it, and the company doesn't care, and certainly not the devs at the top, believe me.",

You're right in spirit, but there are way more nuances to it, and \"management\" is a multi-layered part of the organization with probably over 40 people in it.\n\nFor example, the UI Design Lead is technically part of management. If X aspect of the UI is buggy or broken, they've probably been saying so for months and not been taken seriously because \"there are higher priority problems to fix.\" Many leads and sub-leads are in this position at the end of development, and all of them would be considered part of \"management.\"\n\nThese are organizational failures, not the failures of just a few individuals.",

They admitted in the emergency call that the last-gen console versions were basically ignored until the end of development, and I'd be shocked if the horrible performance hasn't been a major factor in every single delay.\n\n They've likely been working at trying to get the game to run on PS4/One since at least January, and this is what they've come up with so far.  I see no way on earth that they ever get the game beyond looking like a stable Switch port on those consoles, particularly base consoles.  It literally just wasn't made for them, for some stupid reason.",

You walk into the kitchen, dip your finger in the cake mixture and say \"It's done! plate it and get it out!\" to which your chefs protest. You scream \"YOU LISTEN TO ME! THE CAKE NEEDS OUT NOW, OR THE CUSTOMER WILL WALK OUT AND NEVER RETURN!\" then you proceed to scoop the cake mix into a bowl, and take it out yourself.\n\nThe customer gives you a puzzled look, then the look turns to frustration. The customer has been waiting for the cake for hours, and then the best you can serve is something not baked, hell, not even half baked.\n\nMeanwhile, the chefs are exhausted in the back, overworked, and unable to function properly. Baking and cooking is their passion, their livelihood. The mess that just went out reflects on them, and they know that. They're disappointed and let down, and at this point, pretty much broken. The news is going to break that their restaurant served shitty food. It's not reflective of the chefs, yet in the end, as business dies, these chefs will have to find a new job.\n\nFuck the execs on this game.  \n\n\nEdit: phrasing",

It's literally this situation:\n\nV, a lower ranked staff member, carries out all the dirty work of upper management. Asked to do unreasonable things in unachievable time frames. Anxiety. Depression. Burnout. Hurling chunks in the bathroom. V 'crunches' until they are finally asked to do something they disagree with completely but can't refuse. Shit hits the fan and the only choices V has are: to carry out this task against their own moral values and at great personal cost or to refuse and lose all they have because the Corporation will just chew them up and spit them out. (And replace V because they're disposable).\n\nThe dialogue is literally V protesting against the orders and pointing out the folly of the request. And their boss basically saying it isn't a request and to 'get it done now'. (Hell the subplot even includes lying to investors/the board/public to give them time to fix/cover up their mistakes). \n\nI'm not even claiming its subtle. It's so on the nose.",

            "comment": "Rebellion is in the air at Polish video game publisher CD Projekt SA after the company\u2019s highly anticipated, and thrice-delayed, latest title was released to scathing reviews about glitches.\n\nFrustrated and angry staff fired questions at the board during an internal video meeting Thursday that opened with management apologizing for Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s disastrous launch, according to two people who were present. It was a fitting atmosphere for a company whose slogan, plastered on posters all around its Warsaw office, is \u201cWe are rebels.\u201d\n\nDevelopers asked blunt questions about the company\u2019s reputation, the game\u2019s unrealistic deadlines and the relentless overtime in the months and years leading up to the game\u2019s Dec. 10 release.\n\nThe meeting took place before Sony Corp.\u2019s shocking announcement that it was pulling Cyberpunk 2077 from the PlayStation Store and will offer full refunds to any customer who requests one. During the staff meeting, CD Projekt\u2019s directors said they had come to an arrangement with Sony but didn\u2019t offer specifics. In a Twitter post on Friday, the company said that \u201cfollowing our discussion with PlayStation, a decision was made to temporarily suspend digital distribution\u201d of the game.\n\nA CD Projekt spokeswoman said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on internal meeting discussions.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is one of the biggest games of the year and has been a financial success, selling more than 8 million pre-orders and notching sales records for PC games. But players have found the game full of bugs, particularly on the last-generation PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, sending CD Projekt shares plummeting and leading fans and critics to describe Cyberpunk 2077 as unfinished. CD Projekt\u2019s stock fell 12% in Warsaw Friday, punctuating a steady decline this month that has wiped out gains for the year.\n\nDuring Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s development, staff endured multiple periods of extensive overtime including mandatory six-day weeks to finish the game, Bloomberg has reported. When asked about this crunch time in the Q&amp;A, the directors said they had plans to improve production practices in the future but didn\u2019t elaborate, according to one person who was there.\n\nOne employee asked the board why it had said in January that the game was \u201ccomplete and playable\u201d when that wasn\u2019t true, to which the board answered that it would take responsibility. Another developer asked whether CD Projekt\u2019s directors felt it was hypocritical to make a game about corporate exploitation while expecting that their employees work overtime. The response was vague and noncommital.\n\nMany industry observers have wondered why Cyberpunk 2077, which was first announced in 2012 and was delayed three times in 2020, still appears to be unfinished. Several current and former staff who worked on Cyberpunk 2077 have all said the same thing: The game\u2019s deadlines, set by the board of directors, were always unrealistic. It was clear to many of the developers that they needed more time.\n\n\u2014 With assistance by Konrad Krasuski",

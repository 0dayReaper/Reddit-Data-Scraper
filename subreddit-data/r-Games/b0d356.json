Also - be mindful that many of the ideas introduced in these games dominated the genre for a while - so if the games feel dated, it's because they often invented or popularized a mechanic that you then say and played a refined version of in a later game.  Going by order of release helps to see some of that a bit more clearly.",

IMO Halo 3 is the last truly great Halo game, with Halo 2 at a close second. H3 gets an edge because Bungie just took most of H2's multiplayer concepts and polished the ever living fuck out of them.",

Why try to corner the market with thin margin hardware (that plays nearly all the same games as your competitor) when you can try to capture the market by software/service (Windows).  Xbox hardware is just a Windows 10 PC anyway.  There isn't a compelling reason to avoid a PC release if hardware isn't main factor in your business model.  Microsoft is trying to make gaming seamless and \"easy\" within any Windows device.  The thought is that it will be so easy that people will find themselves just using it, because they have it (less reason to go buy your competitor's hardware).  Throw gamepass in there and now the entire service is complete.\n\nI'm not saying this is the PERFECT way to game.  I'm just saying this aligns with a business model that Microsoft apparently believes is the future of gaming.",

So tilting to see that kind of question, and it sucks that so many missed out on such an iconic series because they stuck to other platforms or were too late to bask in it during their releases.",

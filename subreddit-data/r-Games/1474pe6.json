            "comment": "big reveals from this trailer:\n\n* second new character model shown indicates they have abandoned their plan of updating the old 6 (+ replacing templar with his daughter) and are instead either retiring old characters into new characters or reaching 12-14 characters.\n\n* spear! we knew it was coming.Monk class is a welcome surprise.\n\n* minor movement integrated into most melee skills, including backstep or pointed at enemies.\n\n* second trailer with dodge roll hints at it being a default movement skill, completely overhauling the movement skill system, but maybe it's not that radical and it's just a new skill.\n\n* countering the current one button gameplay, a new complex skill rotation system with resource spenders and generators( look at the blue charge rotating around the character).in this case it's a 3 skill rotation which is more complex than what we have right now.This is proving controversial with poe players who love the 1 button gameplay and don't want to be forced into cooldown or resource spenders and generators.I'd say it's unlikely they made the old 1 button style unviable, more likely they just want multiple playstyles to cohexist.\n\n------\n\nDon't get baited by the speed: they are showing us act 3 gameplay, deliberately slow to look good for all players and showcasing skills.They always do it for new skills or presenting the game to new audiences.They might have slowed down the pacing of the endgame, but you can't tell from the current trailers.",

In builds with 2h weapons you can use a second damage skill to help with single target damage. There's certainly a huge discrepancy between skills that are good in AoE or single target, so all else being equal there's an incentive to use different skills.\n\nThere are also a lot of secondary utility skills that are very useful, and mechanics like the Elemental Equilibrium Keystone that incentivize using skills of different elements.\n\nThe issue there is that the game is too fast to be worth even taking the time to press a different button, but there's a real chance they actually slow the combat down. Surely not as much as is in this video, but still. It's a matter of balancing the gameplay systems, I don't think going on a skill by skill basis is needed at all.",

As far as unique models for each ascendancy, they're limited a bit in the sense that you pick your Ascendancy around level 32, so, it's probably a hairstyle and default costume swap with different dialogue, rather than anything as radical as a totally new gender. This monk-ish character being outraged by corruption would also fit an Ascendancy specific line.",

However is it just me or does the background and character almost look apart from each other? As if the background is just some slideshow, it looks odd to me.",

Its not like you COULDN'T use several skills in PoE, it just wasn't a good solution compared to a optimized setup. This trailer seems designed to show several effects not how the game will be played. \n\nMaybe I am overly cynical but it also doesn't really look like \"real\" gameplay. Overall it feels very \"choreographed\", as if all the fighting and damage to enemies is fake.",

You have super old veterans from when the game started and was rather slow, you have zoomers enjoying the fast pace mindless grind, hardcore players that enjoy current game but it also is a bit different for them (they already play a bit slower) and would like for the game to be a bit more \"controllable\", people who are interested but off put by zooming. I would personally prefer slower more complex gameplay, mindless zooming makes me feel asleep at this stage, D4 feels a lot better.",

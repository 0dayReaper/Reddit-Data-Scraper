I'll keep this short: I love old school FPSes, so for the last 2+ years, I've been working on Interlopers on my own in Unreal Engine 4. Main inspirations are classics like Serious Sam and Doom.\n\nThe trailer focuses primarily on the game's first world, but it also includes brief glimpses of some of the other environments that will be featured later in the game.\n\nThanks for looking! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!",

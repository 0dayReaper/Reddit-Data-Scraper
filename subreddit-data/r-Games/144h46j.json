What's not great is having to deal with the lethargic menus and UI to engage with all the systems. Idk, it's in desperate need of some quality of life features, because having to constantly fuck with the menus to do ANYTHING gets really tiring.",

It\u2019s a fake genre that is only ever brought up when someone wants to feel superior for playing certain games. I\u2019ve never seen a discussion about immersive sims that did not start in bad faith. Worst fandom in the industry, and that\u2019s saying a lot.",

There\u2019s only so many of them out there I feel like most of the time they\u2019re spreading the word to help popularize the sub genre. More sales means higher likelihood we get another good one.",

Maybe I've only had very poor explanations of what makes something an \"immersive sim\", but I just don't get what makes it a cohesive genre. (I think \"incremental games\" have a similar problem, but that's probably another discussion.)\n\nI don't know for sure that the discussions and descriptions I've seen are bad faith, but it feels like a lot of them boil down to \"I only like these specific games and want to justify why\". Which is wholly unnecessary; it's fine to like and dislike whatever games without having a special reason.",

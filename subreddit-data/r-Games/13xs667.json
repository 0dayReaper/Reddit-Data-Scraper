            "comment": "For the ones who dont know, CBU2 aka Creative Business Unit II is the division in Square Enix created after the merger of Business Division 6 (Dragon Quest, Nier), Business Division 7 (Lord of Vermilion, Gunslinger Stratos) and Business Division 11 aka \"Team Asano\" (Bravely, Octopath Traveler)\n\nSquare Enix currently has 4 CBU and on this one just like most CBU, most of the games are developed externally with SE staff being part of these external teams to oversee and also creatively work with those studios, like producers or writers working alongside Acquire for Octopath Traveler 2, with majority being from those studios.\n\nImo most of the Luminous teams will go to work on DQ12, which is the only game developed internally by CBU. And with this CBU1 develop KH4 and FF7R, CBU2 DQ12 (maybe a new or different IP if they dont use luminous for DQ?) and CB3 with FF14 and FF16.",

FFXVI had key art leak before the release of FFXV that we now know is the [Sanbreque capital and mothercrystal](https://i.redd.it/xwmh4w9000w51.png).",

Production on XVI only began after Heavensward's 3.4 patch shipped in late 2016, with Yoshida and a small group doing conceptual pre-production work from after Heavensward's release in mid-2015.\n\nThat said, none of this necessarily reflects how XVII is being developed. We know that [CBU1 has been developing a new AAA action title outside of the Remake trilogy for roughly three and a half years](https://twitter.com/_bazztek/status/1190689251219820544/). While it's probably a new IP, there's a non-zero chance that it was either a Final Fantasy all along or it turned into a Final Fantasy at some point along the way.",

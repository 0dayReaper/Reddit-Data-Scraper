We're assumingly at the end of the Switch's lifecycle, this would have been something super cool in like 2018 but now personally I'm not interested. I don't play in handheld much anyways, but this probably would have made me play handheld more back when the Switch released because I hated the way the Joycon felt and never wanted to play with them when I could just use a pro controller\n\nInterviews with the makers seem like a cool company though, maybe theyll luck out and the Switch 2 will have the same dimensions, also the price point seems phenomenal for how these type of accessories seem to be overpriced recently",

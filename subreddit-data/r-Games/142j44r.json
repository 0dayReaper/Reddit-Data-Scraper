I was doing one of the fights where they throw up a big health bar for a group of enemies, and realized I'd knocked one off a cliff, but it had survived, and had no way to return. I didn't notice until the end of the fight what had happened, and when I was about to glide down to wrap things up, it suddenly vanished and respawned in what I assume was its original spot. In that case, I could see it as an easy fix to assure these encounters can end without requiring the player to go hunt down missing enemies.",

I'm thinking like 99$ equivalents, if it would even be worth selling for that much, just to bring it to another group of people who wont/cant pay for more expensive options.",

It's entire colonial Empire was in part based upon Britain trying to remove itself from European politics as much as possible. It very much often sees itself as \"not part of Europe\".\n\nIf Americans wanted to get a better idea of what things are like in Europe, then maybe Germany is the better measuring stick as it is the center of Europe, geographically, but also socially and politically it's kind of right in the middle as it always rides the line in trying to make West-, East-, North and Souther-Europe happy, which each have their own different interests. I.e. West- and Northern-Europe being industrially strong and also provide EU-funds, whereas South- and Eastern-Europe are economically weaker and reliant on EU-aid.",

Returnal is a great recent example of that. But they also do focus on presentation, so in a lot of ways you get the full package of gameplay, story, graphics, sound design, etc. It's just that within an individual series, the gameplay doesn't change too much between sequels. But, Sony tends to move on from IP once the gameplay of that series has been fully realized. Almost all of Sonys big IP from the past are dormant (jak and daxter, sky cooper, twisted metal, infamous, resistance, killzone, etc). Sony likes to introduce new IP for new gameplay. Nintendo on the other hand tends to re-use the same IP, but with hopes to change up the gameplay enough to keep each entry unique and fresh.",

But feeling the need to elevate Nintendo by making up arguments against Sony is foolish.\n\n\nEdit.

And nuts and bolts wishes it controlled that well, but that's another point.\n\nUnlike Nuts and Bolts which was 100% vehicle content.\n\nBut yes if you ignore this **GIGANTIC** difference in gameplay, those two games are totally the same, yup.\n\nAnd I think the point with \"same story\" is not that they are literally the same story but how they have VERY similar moods and themes, even though they are different IPs, and also share general realistic art style, color correction/contrast, camera perspective, gameplay pacing etc. I.e. Last of Us (at least Part 1) and God of War being what's now called the \"Sad Dad Genre\". Basically: \"what is a story about VS what is a story ABOUT\". What's the story on paper VS what is the message of the story. There things start flowing together a lot. And if your game is much more narrative based than that is as much big of a fault as having i.e. a Gameplay based franchise but all the games play kinda the same (i.e. the UbiSoft open world formula... Watch_Dogs, Assassin's Creed and Far Cry are kinda sorta the same games even though they are all different story and different settings they are each rather VERY similar).",

I'm using that as an example of why using such a blanket statement is bad. which you all still fell for?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/142j44r/nintendo_switch_and_the_legend_of_zelda_dominated/jn83pzk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n\nAlso Ubisoft games are not Sony exclusives so they are literally not apart of this argument.\n\nEdit. I feel like nobody is actually putting substance into the argument that these games have the same story. How does The Last of Us have a similar pacing and theme to Spiderman? How does God of War feel just like playing Horizon Zero Dawn? It feels like you are just saying whatever you want with no backup as fact. Lemme know how the pacing of Demon Souls lines up with the newest Final Fantasy game? \n\nYou don't have to invent arguments and try and bring other studios down because you love Nintendo. Sony and Nintendo can both make good games.",

It's a good way to describe the game if you have to use other games to do so and it's a pretty funny comparison but it's different leagues honestly. The in game systems systems go deep and the physics are insane. It's a miracle it runs on the switch. I didn't like breath of the wild as much as most people did and didn't finish the game but this one I've played like 70 hours already and I'm definitely going to be playing more. \n\n&gt;Reaching hard-core for this one to claim Sony always has the same stories across the vast mountain of IPs.\n\nThat was about Nintendo, I was saying Sony normally has great stories and Nintendo reuses plots allot and innovates gameplay wise. Although the story in totk and most loz games are way more engaging than Nintendo's usual stories for their other games.\n\n&gt;while no disrespect to the franchise Zelda is essentially ALWAYS Link does the same four temple's and beats Gannon.)\n\nI mean that's just very untrue unless you're only looking at like ocarina, botw, and totk and even then the themes and plotlines vary allot. Ocarina had very strong themes of growing up, losing your childhood innocence, and what it means to become a man/adult. Botw link wakes up after 100 years only to realize he lost a war and has to pick up the pieces and save Hyrule. It's a lonely, sad and disjointed world that needs healing and you definitely feel that loneliness while playing. \n\nTotk seems to have more actual story so far but I'm not done so I'm not sure where they're going with it but it's way different than just \"defeat Ganon\" so far.\n\nBut ya as for your last paragraph I wasn't doing that I just worded it weird maybe. (Not just maybe, that was worded really badly lmao I fixed it) I think Sony has great stories, I think the gow 2018 is one of the best in gaming. They always put stories first. Like I said I was pointing out that Nintendo normally prioritizes gameplay while Sony prioritizes story, that's why people like both companies for different reasons.",

When you boil down massive games that span genres as \"all sony stories are the same\" and \"TOTK is the same game with crafting\" it sounds quite silly. That's my point. Nintendo and Sony are both doing very well ATM and neither is putting out many duds.",

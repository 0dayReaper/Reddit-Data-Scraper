    "postText": "The new Hitman trilogy has tons of great levels.  They are very puzzle box like. The first time you play them you don\u2019t have any equipment and have to explore and use whatever you can find to eliminate your targets. Then you replay it and eliminate each target in a different way, etc. \n\nThat\u2019s where the brilliance lies. You might overhear a conversation, read a document, or just get an idea for an assassination and think \u201cIf I do x and y, can I kill the target in z way?\u201d, and most of the time, the answer is yes.\n\nMiami, the first level in the second game, is set during a high-profile car race. Both targets are sectioned off into different areas of the level. One of them is a racer. [There is a bridge over the track](https://imgur.com/a2d7ef48-0e72-43f7-b876-c3f018201708). &gt;!It\u2019s easy to knock out an NPC, bring them to the bridge and then with a well timed push, knock them onto the targets car.!&lt; &gt;!But it immediately brings to mind the idea that you can kill two birds with one stone by luring the other target there and doing the same!&lt;\n\nDishonored 2 has a level called \u201cThe Clockwork Mansion\u201d. It takes places at a mansion where you can pull levers to change the layout of the level. [Here is what happens when you pull the first one]( https://imgur.com/T7SlvhJ). The entire level is like this. It also has giant clockwork soldiers walking around and if you time a lever pull just right, you can destroy them when the room layout changes. \n[Here is an overview of the level by the youtube channel \u201cGame Makers Toolkit\u201d. He talked to several of the developers about the intricacies of the level]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIZTk4QRRFE) \n\nSome levels are so good they even have their own [Wikipedia pages]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Video_game_levels) Including several Hitman levels.\n\nAre there any similar levels in games that are as intricate and well designed as these?",

As far as mission assignments for a super secret agent go, breaking into a bank vault doesn't seem that exciting but the number of ways you can infiltrate the bank are what make the level fantastic. You can sneak in through the front entrance, a side maintenance door, climb onto the roof and infiltrate through the ceiling, or cut the power and go in through the window. Then once you're inside you've got to use your tools to avoid all the cameras &amp; laser alarms, or you can hack the computer terminals to disable everything.",

The first two levels had you fighting mainly low-tech guerillas to teach you the ropes, the bank is where the game really opened up and taught you about high-tech hazards like motion sensors, cameras, lasers, keypad locks, terminals, RFID-chiped guards, ect. Every level (with maybe the exception of the anti-climactic last mission) introduced something new either in terms of enemies or environments.",

Dishonored has a very strong action component, while in Thief you are just not supposed to fight people, and killing is straight up banned on higher difficulties (you can set difficulty before every mission and you can see how requirements change).\n\nAlso, the age of the games really shows, they are clunky and ugly to a modern player, so I can understand it can be a very difficult experience.",

The ability to see NPCs through walls eliminates the need to carefully listen for footsteps like you need to in Thief.

The AI is terrible tho. Guards seeing you out of nowhere, stuck pathing and being unable to run away and hide cuz they will always find you. \n\nIt's still a nice game, but its formula got improved a lot in newer games.",

It sometimes comes of as unfinished which may be the case considering the rushed development it suffered. Thief 1, surprisingly, does not have this issue (except in the \"dlc\" gold levels) and feel much denser and artistically intentional as a result.",

In most \"stealth\" settings enemies just don't see you unless you are basically in front of them. Sounds and surface were also a big issue, is still remember loving to find a nice carpet to run at a guy.\n\n&gt;being unable to run away and hide cuz they will always find you\n\nHaven't played the game for ages and this might be the case, but on the other hand guards in many games are far too forgiving. Run for ten seconds and then reset because \"it must be rats or something\" and \"I guess they disappeared\". Now, that can be reasonable from the gameplay perspective, but kinda feels too easy at times.",

Some might have improved on *aspects* of it, but all of them either did something wrong that diluted their commitment to stealth (Dishonored turning you into a god being the premier example) or just approached the concept of \"being a shadow\" in a different way (Mark of the Ninja, Chaos Theory, Invisible). I'm genuinely curious: in your view, which games managed to surpass Thief? If nothing else, it's a take that is quite... *unorthodox* among fans of the stealth genre.",

            "comment": "Half Life 2 I feel doesn't get brought up much in these discussions, but it really is a great game for introducing someone to the concept of First Person Shooters. I think people overlook the apparent ease that people have getting into shooters these days but I believe that it's due to games like Half Life having such great level and game design. \n\nI mean you spend the first while in the game without any weapons, because the game is giving you time to get used to the fundamentals of controlling an FPS and just walking and looking around. Then the first challenges you face are puzzles involving picking up and moving items, which was fairly revolutionary back in the day because physics engine, but even today it still serves as a good tutorial for interacting with the world which is fairly commonplace in most modern Shooters. Things like stacking boxes to make a staircase or weighing down a see-saw and the like. \n\nThen you get a crowbar first because it's the simplest possible weapon to get used to attacking enemies. But even when you get a pistol, you'll notice that suddenly a ton of explosive barrels show up in the level. And they just so happen to be positioned next to all of the enemy spawns. So it helps ease the player into the concept of aiming by giving them giant red targets to shoot at instead of the moving hostiles. Later on you're introduced to Headcrab Zombies which so naturally teach the player about headshots without a single dialog box or a message drawn on a wall with blood shouting \"YOU HAVE TO KILL THE HEAD\" or something dumb like that. And I probably don't even need to gush about Ravenholm and how fun that level is when you have just got the Gravity Gun.",

It's awesome because in terms of gameplay, bosses, and individual level design it really is the best of the series in my opinion, but unfortunately it lacks the sense of unknown wonder that the first (and even the second) game had. In fairness I think Fromsoft made the best possible Dark Souls 3 that could exist, it's just that the third game in any series can't be as unique and revolutionary as the first game unless every title is completely standalone ala Final Fantasy. I think Fromsoft realized this and that's why they seem to prefer new IPs lately set in entirely different worlds instead of spitting out more Dark Souls.",

Paired with the fact you can lift and arrange just about anything, you're able to use this to skip gates that would normally require one of the other 3 skills. It's not a playstyle often considered because it feels like cheating, but Zelda has made 2 games based entirely on this concept now.\n\nIt's not taken often but the CASIE augs give you entirely new dialogue options that let you socialize your way around some problems.\n\nThere is also all those resistance upgrades that let you take shortcuts through areas you have no business being in.\n\nConsidering the developers had to allow for no augment completion and everything in between that and 100% augs, the level design is still top notch. I replayed HR 20 times by now and I still find different builds to do that make me rethink the entire game. \n\nSaying it's just 3 of the same options discredits the lengths they went through to make 10 different playthroughs have a similar level of challenge. There is only one level that sucks for almost all playstyles and that's the last level.",

There are a lot of encounters where you have the option to run straight to the end and hope you don't get killed while frantically trying to push open the exit.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QkuI-vvJ2G0",

At the same time, with zero changes, they're also set up to allow you to go REALLY FAST once you learn the route, except oops you missed the shortcut so now you have a new route through the level to try out\n\nThere might even be another 2 or 3 routes through the level you haven't found yet and all the while, you're unlocking good brain chemicals by lowering your personal best time and having fun doing it\n\nAnd in a completely different vein, if you think of **Subnautica** as a single level, it's really well designed to funnel you through the experience of basic survival -&gt; building up a little -&gt; and progressing the story\n\nThis intricacy is largely diminished when you break the game world down into its constituent biomes but I think they're all pretty cool too because each one teaches you about how the game works, what you can find and where, what hazards to be aware of in each biome...",

Skyward Sword has some of the best dungeons in the series, but the areas leading up to them were also very fun to navigate. They weren't just big empty areas, you had to solve environmental puzzles and deal with obstacles and clear a path/shortcuts to the dungeons and so that you'd be able to navigate the regions more freely in the future.",

It's all very fun. And the later levels allow for variety in how to tackle them for a nice and smooth run. \n\nGhostrunner is a good time (albeit difficult with the one-shot-you're-dead mechanic), and it can feel *very* satisfying when you figure out how to breeze through a run.",

They're designed to feel convincing as towns on the edge in 1899, but manage to contain bizarre mazes and alternate paths that will confound pursuers or lead people right into a trap. The game's soundscape in particular is very carefully designed, letting players understand threats in their immediate area while also making any given scenario one that requires careful action. For example, a flare will instantly kill some of the most dangerous undead, but will make them scream while they burn, alerting other players nearby. Sneaking past is quieter, but if you screw up they'll either take big chunks of your health or require you to fire your guns--which everyone on the map can hear. There's a lot of calculated risk involved, which is *perfect* for a tense extraction shooter.",

The whole place just seems different after a while, even if nothing changed.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough, I never see anyone talk about it, probably because the characters are anthropomorphic animals instead of humans and the first few minutes in the cellar make the game seem smaller than it is but the world is so immersive.\n\nAnd the backgroundstory of the world is surprisingly adult. It doesnt hit you on the head with it and you have to think for yourself but that made me appreciate it even more. I was really drawn in by it and I often think about the game, hoping to get to see the next chapter. The ending is rather open.\n\n---\n\nalso your descriptions of \n\n&gt;\u201cIf I do x and y, can I kill the target in z way?\u201d, and most of the time, the answer is yes.\n\nsound very much like all the tasks in Zelda BotW and now TotK. you are so flexible in approaching every obstacle although besides Hyrule Castle I wouldnt call the levels themselves very intricate",

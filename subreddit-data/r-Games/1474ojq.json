It'll be interesting to see a completely different whole-cast interpretation at least, even if it isn't obvious whether it'll be an improvement. I imagine there will be dual audio as well, hopefully.",

            "comment": "I get that people were attached to the old cast, as was I, but you gotta remember a lot of them are getting on a bit now and these characters are literally teenagers. Of course that's not to say they can't still do a good job of it but it's usually pretty obvious when an actor is way older than the character they're playing. I just don't know if I can really buy Liam O'Brien as a 17 year old anymore, you know? It's probably for the best that they're bringing in a newer generation of younger actors to take over, who can also potentially play the characters for longer if they need to.\n\nMy half-serious conspiracy theory is that because they would've had to recast Junpei anyway (his voice actor had some controversy a few years back and left the industry completely), they didn't want that controversy to dominate the story so they decided to do a full recast, that way they can shift the narrative to it being a more creative or logistical choice. Which it also probably was, but I think they must have figured \"well it's going to be weird either way, so might as well go all-in on it\". A remake is probably the best time to do something like this anyway, since a lot of new players will be coming in.",

It'll be *really* fucking weird to not hear the old cast, especially with how iconic they are in their roles, but I'm also genuinely curious to hear what a new take on the characters will sound like as well. Atlus has a good voice direction team and it's a very solid cast in isolation so I doubt it'll be bad, just different, and I'm down to give different a chance.",

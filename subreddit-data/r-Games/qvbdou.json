Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry\u2019s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their \u2013 and our - values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick\u2019s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.\u201d\n\nSounds to me like he's as safe as he's ever been",

Also, the 'changes' are that Bobby had his CEO pay docked (which is meaningless compared to his actual shares-based income) and a few other meaningless actions. \n\n\"fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day\"  \nProbably because the WSJ is about Bobby, and not the employees. \"Pls don't be mean to WSJ, think about all his employees that are not being shitheads!\"  \n\n\"The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick\u2019s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct.\"  \nNo, the desire was not to be sued into oblivion and to damage-control the bad press of Activ-Blizz horrible actions. Otherwise, this would have been actioned upon before the WSJ report. Also, zero-tolerance policy ... for everyone who isn't Kotick.  \n\nThis is just a repeat of the first, terrible press release Blizzard did earlier this year, which they had to walk back on.",

Then they heaped a digital pivot on top of them.\n\nThe CEO in charge during EA Louse stepped down.  \nHis replacement implemented the digital pivot about a decade later and stepped down when the growing pains from the pivot impacted the bottom line.  \nThey put in an interum CEO who was in charge for almost a full year while they searched for a replacement (they brought back the first CEO who implemented the first changes after EA Spouse/Louse).  \nFinally they put in a new long-term CEO who was an internal promotion of a long-term employee\n\n1 scandal and 1 paradigm shift led to 4 different people sitting in the CEO's chair.\n\nvs activision...\n\nWe're at what, 3? 5 scandals in less than 4 years along with another 26 years of toxicity and Kottick is still at the helm?

He kept an exec from being fired after a sexual harassment claim. He didn't tell his board of alleged rapes and other misconduct. Our \n@WSJ\n  investigation:\n\n\n&gt;Since CA filed suit against Activision Blizzard in July, the company has received more than 500 internal reports of sexual harassment, assault and other issues. It's been facing an EEOC investigation and a new SEC investigation, as we reported\n\n&gt;Soon after being appointed to co-head one of Activision's most successful units, Blizzard, longtime exec Jen Oneal sent a scathing internal email, saying she didn't think leadership could fix the culture problems. She said she had been sexually harassed and wanted to resign.\n\n&gt;Under Kotick, Activision's game studios were allowed to operate on their own, creating cultures that a spokeswoman told us led to some employees conducting themselves in \"truly regrettable ways.\" Employees were told to keep quiet, even as execs sent out laudatory farewell notes.\n\n&gt;We've looked at dozens of internal documents and spoken to many, many people over these months. A story like this isn't possible without incredible sources. We can't thank you enough for your bravery.\n\nI'll also add [Jason Schreier's thoughts](https://twitter.com/jasonschreier):\n\n&gt;Bombshell story from the Wall Street Journal this morning that lays out how much CEO Bobby Kotick knew about sexual harassment and misconduct at Activision Blizzard\n\n&gt;\"Over the years, Mr. Kotick himself has been accused by several women of mistreatment both inside and outside the workplace, and in some instances has worked to settle the complaints quickly and quietly, according to people familiar with the incidents and documents\"\n\n&gt;Hard to imagine Bobby Kotick remaining CEO after this story. Incredible reporting by \n@KirstenGrind\n @benfritz\n and \n@saraheneedleman\n\nEDIT: Twitter thread from Ben Fritz, co-author (links have images of the article):\n\n&gt;Two colleagues and I spent months reporting on allegations of sexual misconduct at Activision and what CEO Bobby Kotick knew and did about them. I hope you\u2019ll read the story we just published. I\u2019ll also thread key findings\u2026\n\n&gt;[A woman who worked at Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer said she was raped twice by her supervisor after she was pressured to drink heavily.

Look at the way NFL executives had their internal investigator provide an *oral* report, decided they didn\u2019t like what was in it, and asked her not to write a formal report down.\n\nWhen these sort of stories about a company\u2019s culture come out the CEO has to be fired, every time. Either they knew and let it happen, or they didn\u2019t know and failed their most important responsibility to their employees. That they don\u2019t think they have that responsibility is ultimately the problem in the first place, and we no longer can allow executives who operate companies in that manner.",

This is what allows companies to get away with all the shit they do, at least until it gets to insane levels of bad, like with Activision.  So many companies can get away with so much by keeping it private. Cheaper to pay off the occasional claim then to risk damaging PR and even worse actual laws put in place.   Out of court settlements with NDA's so often just protect the person or organization that did wrong in the first place, impeding change so it can't happen again.",

Amazon pre order price guarantee is great.\n\nPlus you get insane discounts regularly, easily finding games for equivalent $10 USD that are only a year or two old.",

That's less than Control. \n\nGames are not like movie. AAA experience doesn't need to be more than hundred of mill. For instance, Uncharted 4 budget was 40$ millions. You wouldn't call it AA now would you? \n\nPrice tag should not certainly be use as metric to call the game AA. AA should be use on a game that doesn't exceed 20$ millions budget but more than 1 millions. For instance, System Shock remake is certainly not AAA.\n\nThere are exception, of course. Based on how much update the dev put to the game. No Man's Sky for instance start off as indie title. But with over half a decades worth of update. It's safe to say that they are reaching AA sphere by now. \n\nThe same can be said to Warframe. The initial release cost them 15$ millions. And you can tell because it's both janky and repetitive as hell. Level recycling everywhere. Nowadays I imagine it must've cost them almost hundred millions each big update because they brought so, so much into the game. They are considered AAA by some now.",

If you bought a Playstation, obviously you're buying Playstation versions of games regardless of whether they are digital or physical, so you're in Sony's \"ecosystem\" regardless.\n\nBuying digital also doesn't mean you are a Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo customer \"for life\" as it's not forcing you to continue buying their consoles. You can switch consoles each generation if you want, same as physical.",

If a game gets pulled from steam, often you can find it on GoG, Epic, origin, the Xbox store or other marketplaces too numerous to list. I am in no way talking about piracy here. You have options is all I\u2019m saying, and the platform is basically eternal so ending support doesn\u2019t even make sense to publishers. Compare that to console, where if the ONE digital store on your console gets shut down (which make no mistake, it will be given enough time), you are shit out of luck if ever your harddrive fails and you need to redownload your games. Discs offer the only form of real \u201cownership\u201d on console.\n\nAll that being said, I still have a disc drive on my current PC and have some older PC games on disc. I would have preferred if PC publishers had kept pace with the mediums used by console publishers (blu ray then 4K blu ray), but instead they started going digital shortly after going from CDs to DVDs. In some alternate universe where 4K blu ray drives were seen as standard on PCs and publishers released physical copies on the platform, I would opt for those. But PC doesn\u2019t quite necessitate it in the way consoles do IMO.",

Either by majorly changing the game mechanics, story, or even both to the point where it's not even the same game anymore.   \n\n\nTo me it feels like they're just trying to cash in on an old IP, without straight out saying it, and pretending like it's for the fans.   \n\\----------\n\nI am an older gamer, I'm in my 30's now, but I grew up in the time of turn based games, etc.. Looking back at the old turn based games, I'm wondering why we can't still have that with the AAA development. A Final Fantasy 7 remake that's actually the old game, remade into the modern graphics. WIth all the time they save not having to write the story, world, or level designing, they can use to spruce up, and expand on the world even more than the original did.   \n\n\nA perfect example of this, is the Memoria Project, which was just a small unplayable demo done by a group of developers who were passionate about Final Fantasy 9.. Just watching the trailer, and game-play of something that could so easily be an epic game, set in the old designs, with the new modern graphics just makes me want to cry almost. \n\nI fear if Square Enix does ever do a FF9 \"remake\" as I feel they'll just butcher it like the FF7 remake. Don't get me wrong, if you like the new FF7 remake, that's perfectly fine, but the way it was all setup imo, was so lack luster, and shallow compared to other games Square Enix has done, and the combat very lacking outside of just button mashing, for the sake of button mashing.   \n\n\nI feel as though we'll never get a game like the Memoria Project, and it makes me extremely sad. \n\n\\----------------",

I don't really want the exact same game just with shiner graphics, I'd rather they did something new with it.\n\nFF7R is a great example, I can still play the old one if I want but the new one is fresh and exciting.\n\nEdit: also I've no idea how you think FF7R is just button mashing. Can't imagine you've got far in it if that's your approach.",

I always wanted to play OG re4 so when they announced a remake i was happy to wait and play a newer and improved version i guess. but i admit i never got around to playing ff7 beocz of how old it is and never appealed to me so the remake was good for me",

            "comment": "None of what you said about the FFVII remake is even remotely correct (especially somehow assuming it\u2019s *more* button mashy than the original) which just shows a gross bias. It has one of the best combat systems in the series, spawned from advancements throughout the series\u2019 constant evolution of ATB (especially VII, XII and XIII). \n\nSquare does plenty of turn based games. Their main teams have always wanted to push for evolution, huge budgets, and new experiences. If they don\u2019t think turn based fits with their cinematic AAAA goals, then that\u2019s absolutely fine - it\u2019s their games. And frankly, they\u2019re almost certainly right.",

Might has well just replay the original game instead. \n\nI recently played the game with 7th heaven mod, it made the game so much more prettier than the original. Same with moguri for FF9, it was such a pretty experience. \n\nI love remakes, but I'm not really a fan when it's just the same game with a new coat of paint. For example, the remake of secret of Mana really felt like it shouldn't exist.",

Just make a remaster with some quality of life improvements and graphical polish for a fraction of the cost.\n\nDead Space Remake is an example of what you want and, don't get me wrong, it's good, but it was completely unnecessary. They spent years of development and millions on delivering the same game with better graphics. That's such a huge waste of resources and talent.\n\nI would rather they spend more time and money on reimagining the old games. There are such great examples like the RE remakes and you may not like it, but FF7R is another great example of a fantastic remake.\n\nNow I can play the original games and the remakes and have twice as many great experiences.",

I don\u2019t want a \u201cnew spin\u201d on something I love, I want my old love touched up with modern graphics.  Everyone wants to put their own signature changes in place and they typically make things worse. I\u2019d agree with your example, while I liked FF7R a lot I\u2019d have preferred the new story elements have been left out. \n\nI do think we\u2019ve had a few good examples of what you are looking for though - Link\u2019s Awakening, Live a Live, and Resident Evil 2/3 were all decent examples of this.  Maybe not purely 1:1 but each of those games were very close with minimal changes.",

    "postText": "Hi /r/Games! My name is Alex Leone, and I'm the solo dev behind [**Upheaval**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2253300/Upheaval/?utm_source=indie_sunday_top).\n\n**Upheaval** is a text-based sandbox fantasy adventure RPG centered around a single village, inspired by Zork, Majora's Mask, D&amp;D and other fantasy tabletop RPGs, and Stardew Valley.\n\nWatch [Upheaval gameplay](https://youtu.be/KFmaZTMceRU) from the latest release, or watch a [developer playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNDue1izDroBC9zJSR_vkDA) where I complete a single randomized adventure.\n\nMaster the world's secrets over many short playthroughs as you explore the wilds, track down magical treasures, aid or disrupt encroaching factions, and take what you've learned into each new adventure. In 30 days, the enigmatic Magician will arrive! Again! Will you be ready this time?\n\nYour choices matter. Change the balance of power and the fates of everyone you meet! Or, you know, don't. You can drink in the tavern, go fishing, ignore everyone, or just do your own thing. The choice is completely up to you.\n\n* **Incredibly replayable**: Complete each adventure in 30-90 minutes. Play multiple times to discover more about the world and explore over 5,000 possible endings!\n* Explore a **living world** that changes around you, *not* a static adventure that waits for you.\n* **Detailed maps** so that you always know where you are in the world.\n* **Mobile-friendly**: Made to be easy to play on your phone. Play for a few minutes or a few hours.\n* **No typing**: Choice-based navigation means you always know what your options are in any situation, no need to guess.\n* **Accessible**: Blind and vision-impaired players can play with their favorite screen reader using the Win/Mac/Linux Console versions.\n* All your favorite **fantasy tropes**: Goblins, bandits, spells, curses, undead spirits, faeries, visions, true love, and more!\n\n# Download the [free demo](https://leonegaming.itch.io/upheaval#demo) on itch.io.\n\n## Available in early access on [itch.io](https://leonegaming.itch.io/upheaval) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leonegaming.upheaval) for 50% off ($4.99).\n\n### The full game will be **released on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2253300/Upheaval/?utm_source=indie_sunday_wishlist)** when it's done. Wishlist to get an email when it's out!\n\nJoin our [Discord](https://upheavalgame.com/discord) or subreddit /r/upheavalgame to follow development and contribute your feedback and ideas to future releases.\n\nThanks! :D\n\n* [Cover art](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2253300/header.jpg?t=1682021968)\n* [Screenshot #1](https://upheavalgame.com/presskit/upheaval/images/01-screenshot-the-south-road.png)\n* [Screenshot #2](https://upheavalgame.com/presskit/upheaval/images/02-screenshot-overworld-map.png)\n* [Screenshot #3](https://upheavalgame.com/presskit/upheaval/images/03-screenshot-character-and-inventory.png)\n* [Screenshot #4](https://upheavalgame.com/presskit/upheaval/images/04-screenshot-ambushed-by-bandits.png)",

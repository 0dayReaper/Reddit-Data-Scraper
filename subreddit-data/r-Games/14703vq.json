And you can complain about how they\u2019re stretching content out to maximize profits and maintain the player base, which like, no shit. It is a F2P live service multiplayer game\u2026 it makes no sense to not have ongoing content releases and support. Anyway yeah basically we\u2019re going to get stuff on a seasonal basis most likely",

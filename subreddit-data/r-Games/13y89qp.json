    "postText": "&gt;\"Our team has identified a vulnerability exploited by a group of Russian hackers attacking the company for almost a year and a half. Unfortunately, they were able to access and compromise some of our leaked information intended for internal testing of various game aspects.\"\n\n&gt;\"As for now,\" we kindly ask stalkers and those who want to join the Zone in the future not to look at or share any leaked materials for the game. Although these materials are only used for testing purposes and are not release-ready, these leaks may ruin your experience of exploring the Zone by yourself.\"\n\n&gt;\"Rest assured, our team remains dedicated to delivering an exceptional gaming experience,\" \"Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is the game we dedicate our hearts and souls to. Despite the issue, we will continue to ensure that the game will satisfy your expectations, as we hope.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/stalker_thegame/status/1664315994683195412",

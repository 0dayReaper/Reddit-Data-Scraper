That said, it definitely has that kind of \"ascended student project\" feel, where it's janky in a lot of places and doesn't quite fit together like you feel a game should. \n\nThe roadmap doesn't make me think it's ever going to rise to the level of a Left 4 Dead quality horde defense game, but it's fun for what it is. 16 player co-op is hysterical, and I have yet to be in an escape ship without at least one person going \"I'm doing my part!\" as we take off, which never fails to put a smile on my face.",

I think having to wait 3 phases for more of that stuff to start showing up would be a bit of a poor move if that's what happens.\n\nMost of the rest of it sounds great though, some pretty big changes.

Sometimes on Squad there are no updates for a whole year because they have to update the game engine",

The current map also has clear indications of things already in the works in the roadmaps like the \"Hives\"\n\nThe game is extremely fun as is... anytime they get around to adding more content is fine with me. I'm not one who needs to chase after unlocking every available weapon or whatnot; I don't need to freaking prestige rank bullshit; just give me bugs to shoot",

A roadmap is good, but as someone who's played the game almost every day since release some of these priorities seem really misplaced.\n\nPlayers need more, stronger weapons before you add in something like horde mode. Right now getting to extraction at the end of a mission is luck-based, and you can't really affect whether you survive or not. Except by playing as a Hunter.\n\nThe game was fun for a few days, but the novelty wore off quick and the few bugs and desperate need for balance and weapons supplanted it. Maybe later this year it will be worth spending more time in. I hope so. Nevertheless they're off to a fairly good start, I wish them well.",

It's like an arcade game, with 16 people, and sometimes, that's all you really need.\n\nTo keep an active playerbase around though, there's no way they can push out enough updates, so it would have been best if they enabled modding, pending license agreements.",

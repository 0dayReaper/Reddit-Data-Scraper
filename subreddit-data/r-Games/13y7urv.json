What really happens to most older players is that they lose interest and other things in their life like work and family take priority, so they stop trying as hard even if they keep competing.\n\nOnce you hit a base reaction time requirement, getting any faster than that isn't useful for 99.9% of situations.  A huge chunk of reaction time in fighting games is prediction and knowledge, so you know when to look for something.",

If you block an unsafe move you can hit them with  a low kick. \n\nWhen you know the basics, that low kick might go into fireball. so you effectively increase every low kick punish my 80 - 100% more damage. The 'Intermediate' combo trials in game are great for learning these little combos. Dont expect to memorize them, just grind a decent combo for a bit and then hop in practice for 5-10 min each time before a session.",

If you don't have the time or inclination to do that, storymode/singleplayer or party play with friends with similar (in)experience levels may be the only actual draw for you.\n\nEven once you grow, the way the ranking systems work in these games is you will eventually peak with about a 50% win rate, playing people of around your skill. Only way to go beyond is to learn and improve.",

But, I'm not good at fighting games, and I don't *love* multiplayer against random people. And I also HATE cinematic story modes like some fighting games do, where it's like hours of cutscenes and then a fight or two (though I do like how Mortal Kombat does it).\n\nSo when SF6 announced simple controls that even someone like me could maybe do well with, AND a big single-player world tour? *With a custom character?* So I wasn't just like playing Ryu and running around, I could make my own girl and progress through it? I was in.\n\nI really hope this is the path future Street Fighter games go for. And I hope other series take note. I would like to play Tekken or Guilty Gear, but they're too multiplayer-focused for me, and too complicated to play.",

I'll admit, the special moves in 4 were difficult to pull of for me but they seem pretty easy in 6 without being too easy. I like that you start with the meter full so you sort of choose and manage when you use those specials. Overall I'm pretty pleased with it. I usually play fighters when the feeling strikes me and it's generally for maybe a half dozen bouts before I get bored and move on. I've been playing 2 days straight on SF6, the Single Player is just so entertaining. I'll be kinda bummed when I complete it I bet so I'm taking it slow. Everything else is pretty much as polished as you can ask for, the moves feel good, there's lots of old content you can also play, the player hub is cool and matchmaking is simple. If I have any critiques it's that the graphics aren't terribly impressive but it feels like Street Fighter and looks like it so that's good enough for me. I'm more about the gameplay than the graphics when it comes to games like this anyway.",

There have been so many games that tried and at best just found a small niche spot that was somewhat profitable for a short while until the game eventually died.\n\nThese games are designed to hook you in and never let you go because they realized that once players go, they don\u2019t come back. So the whole business model is built around grind and oftentimes FOMO and with that most players just don\u2019t have the time to play more than one GaaS game at a time.",

For smaller games, it makes a lot more sense to focus on the primary fighting game audience and hope you can get big enough there first.",

If those really big AAA fighting games that even casuals know about implement well-thought out campaigns that help teach new players, then that will bring more people into the genre as a whole, and it'll be a lot easier to convert those people from games like SF to other fighting games now that they have a basic skillset built up. \n\nThings like World Tour aren't just great for Street Fighter, they're great for the genre as a whole.",

When you side with the Arasaka lady, Songbird's thing starts regenerating your brain matter on the space station and there's a sequence where you bust out of there with Jackie's engram!&lt;\n\nIt's possible that's changed, since those leaks were pretty old.",

There's a heavy implication that since Arasaka only got their hands on his corpse some hours after his death, they weren't able to map his brain properly.!&lt;\n\nI always found that aspect of one of the endings to be most well-written piece of tragedy in the whole game. And it makes the dilemma around soulkiller a lot more interesting. **Spoiler:** &gt;!If you interpret soulkiller as an actual transfer of consciousness, Jackie is basically trapped in a botched mind. If you don't interpret it that way, it drives home how the engram is just a facsimile of the person, and makes it sadder to think about the people who see the engrams as surviving the original person.!&lt;",

                                    "comment": "&gt;!I think it's pretty obviously just a facsimile. Yes, it has all your memories and your personality, but it's just data. This is why it's called the Soulkiller. Your engram can be placed in a new body, but your soul, or whatever you would call your original consciousnesses, is gone. In one of the endings it's revealed they use the Soulkiller to \"revive\" the kingpin of Arasaka, but it would have to be a copy since he's already long dead by that point.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Thinking of it this way recontextualizes the game quite a bit. V is killed by Dex very early into the game. Johnny's journey is about him trying to find redemption and meaning after his death, but V's journey might also be the same. V is doomed in all of the endings, but maybe he's already dead.!&lt;",

Then you fast-forward to a short playable cutscene, you're in space, embarking on some kind of job targeting the orbital casino you can read about in the newspapers.

It's ambiguous how it goes, if the client can actually cure you or if you're just destined to spend the rest of your life doing jobs and chasing that reward, but it overall ends on a hopeful note. You're a badass, this is your life, and all anyone can do is live it or die trying.!&lt;",

It does still leave it open for interpretation - Panam (+ your romance partner, if not Panam and if they go with you) believes they can find a cure (and Panam has lead #1). V does not, but there isn't really any indication that V knows any better than anyone.\n\nBut either way, V embraces their fate and decides to do what makes them the happiest with the time they have left. It's the ending of finally escaping from the all-consuming clutches of Night City and V becoming their own person - and with a real place to belong.\n\nYou can even just look at the [Tarot cards drawn](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Tarot_Cards#Endings) in each ending, and Misty's explanation. The Nomads ending has by far the most positive and hopeful cards. The only other one that's remotely positive is the Glory ending. Or just look at the actual cards used to represent the endings in the trophies. Nomad ending is The Star:\n\n&gt; The Star is the card of hope. In the darkest of nights there is a light that shines the path to home. The Star is inspiration, motivation, and gives us strength to move forward.",

Not great, but better than being a treated like a gopher.\n\nNeuromancer ends with the heist being a complete success for Case(probably the closest analogue for V, honestly), with him getting his nervous system repaired and the poison removed from his system. He never meets Molly again(probably a healthy thing, lol), and ends up with a girl. From what I've read, in Mona Lisa Overdrive(which I haven't gotten around to just yet) he's even mentioned as having settled down with kids. \n\nIn Count Zero the title character ends up being Angie's(who's a wealthy simstim star now) boyfriend/bodyguard.  Turner manages to get out of the game for good and retire off-the-grid to raise his/his brother's family.  Marly has a thriving art business and has largely repaired her reputation from the forgery scandal that had ruined her career at the start of the novel.\n\nYes, lots of characters die and shit hits the fan *hard,* and maybe it all goes ultimately sideways for all of those characters in Mona Lisa Overdrive(again, haven't read it yet).  But most of the works end with, all considering, pretty happy endings.\n\nCyberpunk as a genre is not just about being grimdark and having depressing-ass endings.  It *can* have that, but just as often it's about eking out what little happiness you can from a deeply fucked up world. \n\n And frankly, it's just plain unsatisfying to have *all* the endings of CP2077 straight up end with \"you're still fucked in exactly the same way you knew you were 4 hours into the game.\"  I honestly think there's only one ending out of the bunch which mostly works, and even that one has it's problems because it works best if you're romancing Panam(which is impossible if you're playing female V).",

Keanu's character model has also supposedly been enhanced, and from the trailer it seems like they're finally implementing proper vehicle combat. Lots of exciting shit.",

This is Cyberpunk 2.0.\n\n* virtually every system of the main game has been changed and/or updated\n* police system is completely reworked with multiple tiers of NCPD/mercs chasing you down in vehicles according to your wanted level, apparently on level 5 maxtac will chase you down and it will be some sort of bossfight against them (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riK1i8lQwRM&amp;t=511s)\n* perks and skills have been completely overhauled, no longer simple passive stat boosts, much more active abilities like different melee finishers, a dash, or the ability to deflect bullets with melee weapons\n* an entirely new 6th skill tree that uses a different type of skill points (relic points) that will be used to add new abilities to your cyberware\n* installing cyberware now has an effect on your body and you cant install too much or else you will go cyberpsycho (no idea what that looks like in game)\n* installing cyberware now has a first person cutscene added to it, just like in the prologue at Vik's clinic \n* you can now \"attune\" cyberware to one of your attributes, making it more efficient if you have invested in that attribute; example here optical camo is attuned to the \"cool\" attribute: https://i.imgur.com/1UI9SEX.png\n* armor is no longer tied to clothing, it instead tied to your cybernetics\n* vehicle combat is added to the game, you can even use your katana on your bike\n* you will be able to hack vehicles, similar to the Watch Dogs games\n* vehicles are no longer bought from fixers, but bought through a website set up by wakako\n* some vehicles have guns installed on them (machine guns, rocket launchers)\n* new type of infinitely replayable/repeatable missions are being added where you need to steal certain vehicles marked on your map\n* new activity introduced \"airdrops\", loot caches that drop randomly on the map that you can fight over and retrieve for yourself\n* tons of new random events/activities are added to make the world feel more alive, like car chases and gang fights",

There's not much hope, the writing is on the wall from pretty early on, and there's rarely a redeeming moment of connection. River is good, but there for half an hour. Your interactions with Judy are built on tragedy with the death of &gt;!Evelyn!&lt;, who could've been a really interesting character but that chance gets torn away. Kerry is a mess. Rogue even manages to make you feel alienated when it's Johnny she has the relationship with. \n\nI know Johnny isn't supposed to be likable, but the game doesn't really give you anything else.\n\nI think that's why so many people gravitate to Panam with the nomad missions and ending. Personally they felt more fallout to me, I wanted big city with neon lights, not rolling round the desert killing raiders. But it's almost the only time you're given any connection or a chance to hope.",

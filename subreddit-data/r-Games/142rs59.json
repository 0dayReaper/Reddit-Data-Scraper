            "comment": "From the article:\n\n&gt; EA is nearing an agreement to move the ongoing development and operation of MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic from BioWare to third-party studio Broadsword Online Games, IGN has learned.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to sources familiar with the matter, Broadsword and EA have signed a letter of intent, with the deal expected to be finalized as soon as this month. The agreement would see The Old Republic handed over to current Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot developer Broadsword Online, which is run by former Mythic Entertainment co-founder and BioWare VP Rob Denton, who previously worked on The Old Republic in its early days.",

Which means that not only do they know how to keep things running, they retain the talent and knowledge that has kept the players on the hook for years. It's why Ultima Online STILL has a profitable playerbase despite being old as sin.",

The game is obviously well past it\u2019s prime (if it ever had one) but there is genuinely so much story content in there that would be lost to time if the game were to shut down. \n\nBecause of this I have been dreading what would happen to the game eventually, so I\u2019m glad to see that instead of shutting it down it\u2019s moving to a different developer.",

Sometimes the wait is pretty short, sometimes it takes minutes. It adds up, especially on busier days.\n\nThis is especially bad for quests that require you to kill enemy NPCs, as they can be killed by other players who aren't even doing the quest.",

Like maybe some devs could hack out even a janky single-player experience?  Just tweak the multipliers to give people a shot in group encounters. Disable group mechanics. Doesn't seem like it would be too bad? Gives room for one last cash out since you could argue it's a separate game (\"Single Player Edition\") and sell it separately. And then the hardcore fans would at least have something left over.",

The game was laid out so that each class would level up by doing their class missions then a series of side-quests on each planet. While the side quests are good and I'd recommend doing them at least once, they are the same for each class and repeating them gets grindy real quick. Most of the value of the game is playing through each classes story line. I would also recommend leaving the expansions until you've played through all the class stories and settled on a favourite, as they're the same regardless of class. There is easily enough content to keep you going for a couple of months.\n\nOne thing before subbing (I'm not sure if this is still a thing but) - people can give you a reference link that will give them perks when you sub, and they're willing to pay you quite handsomely for it. It can be a nice little nest-egg to get you started.",

I did not do anything group based so I can't comment on that aspect of things.\n\nIt is not a true single player experience like those games were.  There is a lot of content that is intended for groups so if you attempt it solo you might not have much fun.  I don't know how the free account is these days, but the time I spent unsubbed while playing after I was subbed felt shitty.  It might probably be different if you experienced the paid versus unpaid experience first though.  I always had to respawn far away if I died and I moved at like 50% speed or something compared to being subscribed.  However, if you are only free then you might not miss something you haven't experienced.\n\nThe story content I experienced was great though so I'd recommend it at least for that side of things.  Might be worth checking out with a free account at least to see if you'd enjoy it.",

They were all so given the engine and told what tools to use. When they had the fend for themselves on andromeda, rather than using a established and well regarded tools that were available to them through their EA partnership, it appears they basically tried to Google and re-implement things from scratch. Especially facial and body animations. Admittedly, a big part of that was the shoehorning of Frostbite, and studios not sharing knowledge or tools built for frostbite, meaning everyone kept trying to redesign things from scratch. Eventually they just dug up the dragon age Inquisition stuff try to save the game in the last 18 months\n\nTo any aspiring came developers out there, never reinvent the wheel until you had several years of development experience under your belt. And then, after that, still don't reinvent the wheel.",

Famously (or infamously) though, despite Bioware Austin being the main studio with multi-player and live service experience with SWTOR, the main bioware office didn't want to listen to them when it came to those things.\n\nThis is a consolidation on EA's part to officially restrict Bioware to a single studio (they had three in their heyday..) and will likely follow with Bioware as a whole being shuttered if Dreadwolf doesn't deliver.\n\nWhich, y'know, despite EA's shady past as a studio killer, Bioware is deserving to be on the chopping block.  Inquisition was their last successful game, and even that pales in comparison to its predecessors.  Respawn has taken over as a studio capable of putting out highly praised single player games, and has more or less replaced Bioware ever since 2019 when they somehow released Apex Legends and Fallen Order in the same year, essentially doing what Bioware wanted to do, but.. y'know, succeeding.\n\nBioware was great for its time, but that time is long gone.",

People talk about the current content cadence under Bioware, but Broadsword's biggest projects are Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot, two ancient games that don't require a fraction of the resources that SWTOR does. Both games were transferred over when Mythic, the original developer, shut down and have received limited support ever since. SWTOR has 8 fully voiced player characters in three languages and full VO. I can't imagine how a smaller company could deliver more content with those same parameters, especially since they're cutting the team down by nearly 50%. \n\nIt does feel a bit like the beginning of maintenance mode.",

Heck, Everquest 1 closing in on **Expansion Nr. 30**  because people still play it. :D\n\nIt's just that MMOs aren't the hot shit anymore like they used to be in the 00s until ~2014 so most people outside of the MMO circle never hear about them anymore.\n\nJust like how Elder Scrolls Online got a new expansion/chapter a day ago and most people on /r/games probably wouldn't even be aware if they are not actively playing MMORPGs.",

The game has already mostly been on maintenance mode, whether players will admit it or not.\n\nThere have been rumors over the years that they were working on another project, possibly something else Star Wars related, possibly a new IP.  My guess is a majority of the studio were in production on something else, it recently got cancelled, and that's what led to EA more or less shuttering the studio.  ToR is active, but I doubt it has big enough of a playerbase to support 70-80 employees, so EA was probably banking on future development.",

I don\u2019t think it ever fell out of the top 15 in terms of player count (argubly top 10 depending what you consider a MMO and if you double count things like WoW/RuneScape Classic) \n\nThat being said as somebody that\u2019s played this game on-off for since launch day they\u2019ve missed so many opportunities to expand their playerbase. They launched right at the start of a decade that saw a complete Star Wars renaissance with a brand new trilogy, a cultural revelation of prequels/clone wars, and a golden age of Star Wars television shows. They were never able to filter that down to a bigger player base despite so much dissatisfaction with WoW \n\nIronically I think the problem might actually been the class stories. The stories are absolutely amazing but the problem is it locks the onboarding and leveling experience to design and gameplay decisions made 10+ years ago (realistically 15 years ago when you consider the development cycle) \n\nWoW, FFXIV, ESO all changed their starting experience and levelling experience multiple times thoughout the years. Leveling in any of those MMOs now is different than when they launched. SWTOR on the other hand is exactly like it was 10 years ago and there\u2019s not really any economically feasible way to change it or even tweak it. The result is it feels incredibly dated",

I believe you can experience the level 1-60 story (that's all of base game plus the first 2 expansions) as a F2P player now, so to be honest, if that's the experience you're looking for, I'd say dive in. All of the story after was garbage, anyway. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that's already played through the 2nd xpac, which was released in 2014.",

Those remaining with EA would have an opportunity to look for roles elsewhere within the company, but may otherwise face layoffs.\"\n\nSo, 40-50 people will still work on SWTOR at Broadsword, the remaining 30-40 people fate is unclear: they will not work on next DA/ME mandatorily (only there is a chance for it), they will work at somewhere under at EA's umbrella or... they will lose their job. So, there is a big chance for this: the next DA/ME projects will benefit from this situation with zero new employee.\n\nHow will this help?",

The game has been in maintenance mode for a while now, but there's still a lot to like about it. Honestly, the most recent expansion and content drops have been very poor so having a new team working on it can't be a bad thing.\n\nLook at it this way, if EA hadn't brought in a third party developer then I think they would have all but ended development for SWTOR. So this might be the best of options.",

I've spent over 1000 hours in FFXIV with my dualsense, and there's no reason that a game with such a similar play-style can't do the same. \n\nMore related to this story though, it does make me wonder what Bioware Austin is needed for in the development of Mass Effect or Dragon Age. Like, what's going on behind the scenes that one studio isn't enough to finish either game, as it had been previously? I want to be optimistic, but I can't help but feel this doesn't bode well for those titles.",

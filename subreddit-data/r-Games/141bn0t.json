Gabe saw the writing on the wall and had no issue talking about it.\n\n\n\nI had this old issue of PCGamer from 1999 and in it is a small blurb about Valve building an online distribution system and how Valve was going to team up with some other big names to build it out. Years later I read that pretty much every developer Valve brought in bailed on the project because the proposed plan was really basic or the technology at the time wasn't really up to par.\n\n\nBut Valve stuck to it and released the first version of Steam in 2002 and by the end of the decade, if your game wasn't on Steam it might as well not even exist.\n\n\n\nValve can see where shit is going and is not afraid to change the status quo and speak up. It's why they're still around. It's why they have multiple cash cows and don't have to worry about releasing a product every 18 to 36 months to keep the lights on.",

When Nintendo stopped doing Directs for their own products during COVID, people described releasing a trailer for a game as shadow dropping, which it absolutely wasn't. It was just a regular announcement but people have their brains wired in such a way now that Nintendo only really do announcements via Directs that dropping a trailer felt like it was shadow dropped.",

It's weird playing it now, it feels way more like a 16-bit game content-wise. It doesn't match what you think when you think \"PS1 game\" at all. Gran Turismo really changed what people expected out of a racing game. I got a PS1 in 1998 and never even considered buying the original Ridge Racer. It's like it never even happened.",

That's not to say that I necessarily lay the blame with ReedPop, but having worked with them in the past they definitely feel like they are set up to deliver really great public events.  E3 is more of a corporate event, and that might require a different attitude/skillset.",

Before you had the 3 console makers and Square Enix, EA, Ubisoft doing their events (Take Two or Activision despite being big publishers never really did). this year we have Microsoft and Ubisoft (Sony did their own but not sure if we can count it as \"not E3\" since it was not in that \"special week\"). And smaller like Devolver, Future Games Show, PC Gaming show and SGF but they're not headed by a publisher/manufacturer which makes them a little different.",

When it's a government office they at least have to publicly define what the policies are and there's (hopefully) democratic pressure to keep the policies in line with what the public wants. Look at the MPAA, the private corporation that issues the content ratings for movies in America, to see what a horrible clusterfuck it can be without that. The identities of the people on the board that rate movies are secret, but the board makeup has to follow some pretty questionable rules, e.g. there must be two Christian clergy rating each movie, one Catholic and one Protestant, but no one from other religions. They don't have to explain why they rate things the way they do, and they've been notoriously ideological about it in the weirdest ways. Listen to the stories from directors like Trey Parker/Matt Stone, Kevin Smith, John Waters, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Mary Harron about trying to get their movies rated and you'll tear your hair out in frustration. Like for 25 years it was a known thing that blowjob jokes were fine but cunnilingus jokes would get your movie burned, because there was one particular guy there who had a thing about it. (By burned, I mean they rate it NC-17, which is nearly a de facto ban because most theater or video rental chains wouldn't carry NC-17 stuff.) Former ratings board members have talked about rating war movies differently based on whether they seemed patriotic and things like that.",

Because as someone who lived through *Mortal Kombat*, *Doom* and many similar games and also heard exactly what Lieberman and other politicians were proposing, that's where we would be today without the ESA.\n\nYou don't like subscription models? Look around to the vehicle and appliance industry and see that these aren't a creation of the ESA, and the government replacing the ESA would have no impact on them either.\n \nConsolidation? That's business. The ESA has nothing to do with whether businesses merge, expand or go bankrupt, those are still subject to the approval of governments (as seen recently in the Microsoft-Activision merger talks.) \n\nGeneral reduction of value to the consumer? I don't even know what this is talking about -- while we do have season passes, subscription models and the elimination of things like private servers (things which have helped to keep the price of video games *below* the rising cost of inflation for decades), today's games offer longer playtimes, more details, intricacy, graphical fidelity and mechanical variety than any point in history I can think of (and I say that as someone who started on the Atari 2600). Maybe, *maybe* one can make the argument that the C-64, Apple II, Mac and IBM/Tandy era of the mid-to-late 80s offered more variety and feeling of unlimited potential because everything was new, but the ESA didn't make that come to an end, that was a natural progression of the industry.\n\nI'm a classic gamer and love my old arcade, NES, SNES, Genesis and PS1 titles as much as or more than the next three guys, but claiming that we're somehow at some pit of lost value in the modern gaming environment is misinformed at best.",

Smaller entities struggled to get enough coverage to justify the (often enormous) expense of running an E3 booth.\n\nE3 worked well as a press event when the primary way of getting gaming news was magazines and cable television. But today, even smaller developers and publishers can just throw up a twitch stream that has a much wider reach, for only a fraction of the cost. E3 was never going to survive as a press event in the current media landscape, and their attempts to pivot were too little, too late.",

Fast forward even more years and now it's broadcasted live in several places without even needing a cable subscription, so basically they can reach anyone with a internet connection. \n\nSo by then, you can drop a live show at any given moment, broadcast it Live simultaneously on twitch, YouTube etc etc while generating the same amount of buzz on your own schedule.

Back when E3 started it was legitimately the only way to see like actual video of upcoming games by watching it on TV. The only other things like that at the time in the 90's were like Commercials which could only be 30 seconds long, and in-store demos. Otherwise we were limited to things like magazine articles with static images and just someone describing the game. \n\nBut once we actually had the ability to just watch those things online whenever we wanted, the core conceit of E3 was lost and it mostly just stuck around out of tradition. It was *the* video game trade show. If you were at E3, you were a big deal, and the idea of people that had already been at E3 for years not going was almost thought of as a sign of weakness or something like that. Like if they didn't go people would assume that the company was in dire straights even if they still showed off games elsewhere. So I think it was basically a game of chicken to see who would pull out first which to make the other companies not look as bad.\n\nEventually though as companies are want to do, they realized just how much cheaper it would be to ya know, *not* spend millions on some gigantic elaborate stage show with a million screens and cringy performances. Not to mention that making builds for E3 would often cost the actual dev teams months of time and resources that wouldn't actually end up in the final game. And of course people realized that as long as you're still making good games and showing off trailers, people aren't gonna suddenly think that the company is in the red. \n\nAll covid did was speed up that process by giving everyone an excuse at the same time to finally not attend and do fully online shows. At which point it became obvious to everyone at all levels that E3 was a relic of a bygone era. And it sure as hell wasn't the Summer Games Fest killing it lol.",

This is Cyberpunk 2.0.\n\n* virtually every system of the main game has been changed and/or updated\n* police system is completely reworked with multiple tiers of NCPD/mercs chasing you down in vehicles according to your wanted level, apparently on level 5 maxtac will chase you down and it will be some sort of bossfight against them (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riK1i8lQwRM&amp;t=511s)\n* perks and skills have been completely overhauled, no longer simple passive stat boosts, much more active abilities like different melee finishers, a dash, or the ability to deflect bullets with melee weapons\n* the difficulty curve is reworked/rebalanced\n* the loot tiers are reworked\n* archetypes of enemies have been redone for more variety in combat encounters\n* an entirely new 6th skill tree that uses a different type of skill points (relic points) that will be used to add new abilities to your cyberware\n* installing cyberware now has an effect on your body and you cant install too much or else you will go cyberpsycho (no idea what that looks like in game)\n* installing cyberware now has a first person cutscene added to it, just like in the prologue at Vik's clinic \n* you can now \"attune\" cyberware to one of your attributes, making it more efficient if you have invested in that attribute; example here optical camo is attuned to the \"cool\" attribute: https://i.imgur.com/1UI9SEX.png\n* armor is no longer tied to clothing, it instead tied to your cybernetics\n* vehicle combat is added to the game, you can even use your katana on your bike\n* you will be able to hack vehicles, similar to the Watch Dogs games\n* vehicles are no longer bought from fixers, but bought through a website set up by wakako\n* some vehicles have guns installed on them (machine guns, rocket launchers)\n* new type of infinitely replayable/repeatable missions are being added where you need to steal certain vehicles marked on your map\n* new activity introduced \"airdrops\", loot caches that drop randomly on the map that you can fight over and retrieve for yourself\n* tons of new random events/activities are added to make the world feel more alive, like car chases and gang fights",

It's explained better in the Netflix series but the more cyberware you have the less human you become. Basically your body is rejecting being human as you become more machine like. You body and the cyberware are at odds with each other causing you to lose control. It's like having a dissociative identity disorder. You basically are losing who or what you are. \n\nSee:\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dissociative-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20355215",

What you describe is how these people may appear to others, but inside (as evident by the internal monologue of the protagonist) they\u2019re still the same person, except now the person on the inside actually has the tools to achieve their goals on the outside. They become determined, not inhuman.",

This in turn has led to execs promising the moon on their projects and pushing down the responsibility to ship all of that shit to the teams.\n\nThe problem is, that's not how it works, unless you're Star Citizen and the problems are solved by promising more. So while the pandemic did of course have an effect, I'd say what you've been saying in the last few years is a reckoning of all that as well.",

In Elden Ring if you get stuck you'll be able to just decide to wander somewhere else and see what you can find.\n\nIf you dislike forced PvP, it's also less aggressive in Elden Ring. In Dark Souls usually forced PvP can happen when you're alone but meet a condition (are human/embered/literally any time in Dark Souls 2). In Elden Ring you can only be forced into PvP if you have a co-op partner with you which inherently gives you an advantage. You can also activate an item you can buy relatively early that will bring in more help when you're invaded.\n\nIf it's just the combat itself you don't like, or don't enjoy the level of engagement the combat requires, it may still be off-putting. The game is still difficult insofar as it asks you to adapt to it, which isn't what everyone wants. You can't lower the difficulty so finding something that works for you can mean uncomfortable moments and experimentation (some people like magic, some like fast weapons, in early playthroughs I loved getting using a giant shield to keep myself safe).",

I can only think of one annoying one in the whole game, and it's against the easiest main boss in the game.\n2. Magic is very powerful in Elden Ring and very useful.\n3. The melee is still hit-hit-roll-roll. That's just kinda how it works. I'm not sure what else you could really look for though? Like, do you want to be able to tank hits? Because that would really wreck the rhythm/balancing of the game. Do you want to parry more? Because that's definitely a thing. You can also focus on big hits with high stagger weapons that will cause them to enter a state where you can deliver a critical hit that does a lot of damage, this is basically how strength weapons work. Fast weapons are also highly viable, people complain about Moonveil (a katana that scales with dexterity and intelligence, basically a good sorcerer sword) because it's fast, has high damage, and has a really strong ability that basically gives it Zelda sword beams on every attack.",

I picked up Elden Ring only to 1) have something funny to stream and 2) \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f so it didn\u2019t really hurt my wallet any.\n\nI put about 100 hours in my first play through, bitching about it the whole time but after I beat it and sat on it for about a year I realized just how great of an experience it was. I remembered every time I got stuck on a boss and finally beat it how great it felt. So I bought it on PS5 and did another 150 hours and enjoyed every second. I\u2019ve also gone on to platinum Bloodborne which has become my literal favorite game ever and dabbled in some Dark Souls games. Lies of P is my most anticipated game this year. It\u2019s not a From game but a _very_ good souls-like (the demo is out and it\u2019s awesome).\n\nSo, yeah, idk. You might hate it but it was the one souls-like game I could actually beat and turned me on to the genre as a whole. Elden Ring is also by far the easiest of the souls games aside from quest lines which can be very hard to follow, but you\u2019ve got google for that. \n\nOverall I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth trying if you can get it for free or super cheap. For an open world it\u2019s the only game other than BotW/TotK that captures the magic of exploration and discovery.",

Animations (NPCs walking, riding bikes / driving vehicles), dialogue skipping, visual bugs, player vehicle handling, the void of post end-game content. \n\nI played the game twice, once with a 1080 and again with a 4070TI. I didn't experience as many glitches as that, but I believe they're there. They're there in Red Dead 2 and Fallout 4 and Witcher 3 and also every other game in this scope. \n\n&gt;The list goes on, these problems are everything I have encountered, all throughout my multiple playthroughs that have totaled to over 300 hours. I deeply love this game, and it is one of my favorite games ever, but I do realize that its full potential was never met, so I do not believe that this is anywhere close to one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhat is the greatest game in the FPS RPG genre? Is it bugless? \n\n&gt;However, I do sincerely hope that with this new expansion - as well as the boatload of patches, tweaks and additions, the game's full scope will finally be realized. Can't wait, hoping for the best, choom.\n\nOh hell yeah, choom. Every update makes it better and this looks like Blood and Wine scope dlc + an entirely new revamp of the mechanics of the game. It will probably be a buggy mess for the first 6 months or so though. Blood and Wine definitely was.",

It's not all necessarily *bad*, but I can't call it *good* either, especially when compared to their previous work in The Witcher 3.\n\nThe highlights of the story and writing were in the side quest arcs (Peralez, Sinnerman, the romance NPCs each had good story arcs whether or not you did the romance).  But IMO it doesn't make up for the abysmal main story.  Concepts get introduced and then completely dropped, lore tidbits don't get explained but instead just name dropped and then you move on (Voodoo Boys, for example).  Not to mention the lackluster Life Paths and the weird montage with Jackie in the intro.\n\nNot to mention the underbaked systems that are still in the game (loot, cosmetics, progression, etc. are all still lackluster, hopefully the DLC changes that).\n\nI'm glad you had fun with it (and I enjoyed it well enough, I got all endings and achievements).  But I still walked away disappointed by it and I don't think it holds the top spot in any category for me.  I will say though that I think they have a solid foundation and if they do a sequel it has a lot of potential if they learn some lessons from this one.",

Being able to play the game entirely avoiding conflict, alliances and factions with NPCs, the reputation systems being closer to how they work in the TTRPG, a city that feels alive with things going on (instead of scripted linear missions), actual shops (instead of the same copypasted vendor in every single food stall and most businesses closed), how you dress allowing you entry in places or being associated with different cliques (dress fancy to impress the rich, dress adequate to get into a gang, etc), that seeing a product ad would allow you to track the nearest vendor for that kind of item, choices that matter. I also remember them talking how their focus compared to the Witcher was less into making a huge open world, and more into making a smaller city, but every building would be explorable, and every NPC would have a schedule and their own life going on. They also said the story would only be a few hours, but instead be super replayable with many branches and endings based on choices, instead we got a linear plot, with backgrounds that don't even matter, shallow conversation trees, and the same crap ending as Human Revolution or Mass Effect 3, where it all boils down to a final \"choose your flavor\" selection before the ending. It's been years and forgot most of what was said + a whole lot more content that got cut or scrapped, but mostly know of that through a friend working there and don't want to compromise them.\n\nIn essence, they promised they were making an immersive RPG with depth closer to classic CRPGs and TTRPGs, what we got instead was an action game with light RPG elements. Heck, even their twitter bio pre-launch used to mention it being an immersive RPG, and like a month before release they edited it to just action game. They 100% bit more than they could chew and had to cut back, which is understandable, what I'm bitter about is the false marketing for years and the disappointment of not getting a new, well made RPG.\n\nTo go on a side rant, I'm saddened by the current state of RPGs, classic RPGs tried their best to capture the feel of TTRPGs despite technological limitations, but at some point RPGs devolved and got super gamey, and now we get the shallower experiences like Bethesda's games, where instead of a living believable world it's just an open flat map with NPCs that give linear quests. Cyberpunk sounded like it'd be THE RPG to show the competition how things should be, but instead it slumped into an average action game with a cool if wasted setting.",

In all honesty, even Fallout 4 had more and better impact with player choices than this game, and they weren't even good as well...\n\nStill, it plays pretty great as an action game.

Well since the story has multiple endings the phone calls are cannon depending to your personal ending. So they wouldnt need to be made non cannon unless those endings couldnt happen or the base game ending changed.\n\nTBH it could be an extra ending option instead of storming the tower you do the final mission of the expansion ,or you could do the expansion then turn down whatever they promise.",

It sounds really silly but there really is next to no parking to be found in the city and yet there are a lot of cars on the road.  Where do people park to get around?  In terms of the raw gameplay it really doesn't matter, but it does feel really silly to leave your car out on the middle of the road or on sidewalks all the time.  It's one of those things I didn't notice at first and then it's hard not to notice it as your mind wanders while playing the game.\n\nProbably not the most important thing to overhaul though... so it's nice to see that a lot of the gameplay is getting overhauls.  This'll definitely be the sort of update where I'd play through the entire game again, not just the new content.",

There are exceptions but in general it seems like something they turn to when they run out of ideas to improve the actual gameplay.\n\nIt's cool that they're trying to overhaul the disaster that is Cyberpunk, but I will not be buying it, nor any future CDPR games. It seems like a lot of people have forgotten about the blatant false advertising and the technical disaster of the game's launch, but I haven't. Even with all this new stuff, the game will never be what I actually wanted it to be / what was originally advertised (\"THE most immersive open world game to date\").",

As well as not being able to have a 3rd person view. Spent 15 min in character creation only to never see my character. The game just felt so clunky and the city so lifeless I had to put it down after like 2 hours.

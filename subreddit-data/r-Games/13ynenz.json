But when you cross to the other side of the spectrum and have a narrative that just _ends_ without any sort of wrap up or resolution at all, that\u2019s just frustrating. \n\nI\u2019m totally fine with the ending not answering all of our questions, but that can still be done in a satisfying way",

He can see things in his mind and thinks they are his, but in reality what he sees are real things. Anderson brothers are the same - the song Take Control confirm this. How could they have known that the events will play out like that without even knowing about the Hiss, the bureau etc.? Zane was clairvoyant as well - He did not know that Alan Wake will one day be born, he thought it was just his imagination coming true, but what really happened is that what he wrote perfectly aligned with reality - hence the Clicker ended up with Alan during his childhood. Alan couldn't have known Jesse or anything about the FBC - he just saw them in his mind as concepts and thought he created a story - in reality, the story was already happening and he only changed some aspects. He can't write people into existence, he can't create things out of nothing - this has been explained in AW:AN, where you had to align every detail perfectly to change something (the lamp, clock, calendar etc.) - so, Jesse had to exist, FBC had to exist, Hartman had to jump into the lake and emerge as a Taken and later be taken by the FBC to the Oldest House for the spiral door story to come true - too much luck, don't you think? In Alan Wake remastered, there are these QR codes and when you scan them, they redirect you to 3 unlisted youtube videos - in the second one, he says something along the lines ''Have I always written this way? Seeing things without actually realizing I was seeing them? Thinking they were mine? Was this what inspiration was for me?'' - this confirms the clairvoyance theory more than enough. Which mean he probably didnt create the hiss",

Mystery needs to be a conscious choice of your storytelling, not an accidental result of the most interesting output of a thousand monkeys typing. He's right that mystery can be far more interesting than explanations. I see Control mentioned a lot here as a good example, however I often felt like the SCP-like setups often went too far into (formulaic) explanation, so it sounds like they might want to dive into mystery a bit more, which can be great.\n\nBut: Even though the reader is sometimes better off not knowing all nitty gritty details, but that's not a convenient excuse for THE WRITERS not bothering to know the details of their world, and to not make deliberate choices on what to reveal, set up and when to misdirect. For people who care about consistent storytelling, trying to understand, to predict and to be gleefully surprised when predictions turn out wrong, there are few things worse than an interesting story setup that ends up being revealed as shit flung at a wall. It's a form of the \"1000 hours played, 2/10, not recommended\" gamer problem that can apply to other story-heavy media as well.",

Simply having things happen that don't make sense wears thin fast. Unspoken and rarely revealed story elements lets the reader/player/viewer know there is a plan, they can see a pattern and can try to figure out what the rules of the universe are, but you can't let them in on what all the answers are or your story of mystery stops being mysterious.\n\nControl I think did a good job of that, there are still myriad unanswered questions about OOP creation, the Board, Ahti/The Oldest House, Darling, and the Hiss that could serve as fodder for a sequel all on their own, never mind the new aspects that any sequel would presumably introduce.",

There's a lot of great story beats and themes in Returnal...they just don't go anywhere. The devs outright said there *is* no conclusive story, it is just everything at once. Everything is just kind of lore-dripped, and every time you try to put together a narrative, it falls apart.

Yes, the existing technology is there but you need to restructure the Internet to have fewer hops and bigger backbones\n\nI rarely get less than 50ms to anything despite having fiber because it's like 15 hops to most places. A friend of mine in a different part of the state is 30 hops away, so my ping isn't great\n\n&gt;Your theoretical maximal ping is 8ms.\n\nI assume you meant minimum :)\n\n\nAll that said, Nvidia is pretty good. The average ping is very usable, but the jitter is the issue. You get even a few frames at 150ms and the whole experience is ruined. It just takes one switch getting backed up for a few milliseconds",

I would need to input moves earlier than expected to get it to work.

For combos I'd have to start them earlier, since it's muscle memory and I can only input during certain frames, it becomes blindly doing the combo frame tight with missing visual feedback.\n\nSort of like a rhthym game where input is delayed, you can still play the game but you don't have immediate confirmation you did it right.",

It also partly depends on the specific games, with some having extremely high latency (think something like rdr2 vs valorant).\n\nCloud gaming works fine for less twitchy games. ~150ms (TOTAL latency) and lower is generally pretty playable. Some games go even higher. \n\nI\u2019ve used GFN a few times. It\u2019s pretty playable. It feels like playing a game like rdr2 on an old television with old school input delaying vsync on. It\u2019s an issue for some games, but for some others it\u2019s barely even noticeable. I would never want to play something fast paced over cloud gaming. Honestly I think the main issue with cloud gaming (specifically GFN) is the pricing. \n\nYeah if you think about it, it\u2019s a steal. Basically a whole gaming computer for &lt;$200 a year. But most people would rather just buy a console than pay that regularly. Like it is a good value when you look at it, but it doesn\u2019t feel like one (to me at least).

Stadia already had the right idea in sending your input directly to the server, and not to any intermediary device. If people are fine with 80ms latency on a Switch, there's no reason they wouldn't be fine with 80ms latency over the internet, and 80ms isn't just extremely doable, it's actually worse than what's currently on offer.\n\nThe main barrier for cloud gaming remains the availability of low latency internet, and the popularity of latency sensitive genres, like FPS.",

But most people won't hit numbers that low (and most games on the cloud won't allow it lol), and even those that will are getting a huge latency downgrade by using cloud services. And if your setup isn't good for latency locally, cloud gaming is going to be borderline unplayable.\n\nGamers nexus did a lot of testing on latency [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVTsj66g9bA). And note for these tests they're done under IDEAL conditions, via ethernet, on high refresh displays, with high end PC's. Even under those conditions, stadia was adding anywhere from 60ms to 100ms or more of latency ON TOP OF THE LOCAL LATENCY. When your local latency is anywhere from 20ms to 70ms, that means using cloud can double or even triple the amount of latency you get, which is super noticable.\n\nEven under GN's ideal conditions with high end equipment they were getting in excess of 100ms - 120ms of latency with higher end titles through stadia. Lower end titles like thumper were still adding this much latency too, but it was going from 20ms locally, to 80ms over cloud. So not ideal but still playable. \n\nBut again, this depends on your setup. If you're getting not great latency on your setup to begin with, doubling or even tripling that latency by playing over the cloud is going to feel TERRIBLE to play.",

This includes the fact that cloud gaming services seem to have fewer game price discounts from my observation \u2014 they're more likely to be stuck paying $60 or $70 for a game.\n\n(2) People that want to play AAA games.\n\n(3) People that do not have a gaming device capable of playing AAA games. The cheapest such devices today are in the ~$300 range.\n\nThe market that satisfies all three of those conditions *is* niche. You're looking at the market as mostly just (3), while ignoring that the overlap of (3) with (2) shrinks it considerably, and overlapping it with (1) shrinks it even further.",

Streaming an unchanging static screen will use far less bandwidth than streaming gameplay, though certainly not zero.",

            "comment": "&gt; \u201cI think cloud itself is an amazing business model, but when it comes to games, the technical difficulties are high,\u201d said Yoshida, citing latency, which refers to the time it takes for an action inputted on the controller to be reflected on screen, as the biggest issue. \u201cSo there will be challenges to cloud gaming, but we want to take on those challenges.\u201d\n\nGot it in one. Unless latency can be lowered to the point of being imperceptible, cloud gaming will always be a worse way to experience any game that requires precise timing.\n\nTurn-based or other games where exact timing isn't necessary can totally work. But most of the biggest releases each year (especially from Sony) are designed in a way where timing matters, and playing them with latency really worsens the experience. I cannot imagine trying to play God of War or Spider-Man with latency.\n\nI'm still really skeptical that this proposed market of \"people who really want to play high-fidelity games but also don't want to own a console or PC\" actually exists. Traditional game sales continue to get bigger every year. People even play games on their phones. There are always people advocating for a hypothetical group of people who so desperately *want* to play games but just don't have the hardware... and I'm not denying that there are individuals in that situation, but I would be very surprised if it were a substantial demographic. Seems like this will always be a niche.",

An Xbox + game pass will get you hundreds of good games for a fraction of the price that it used to. Sure, it requires the upfront purchase of a console, but traditionally this has not really been a substantial barrier of entry, and traditional game sales continue to grow year over year.  PC gaming is way too high right now, but consoles all have more affordable options and good libraries to pick from.\n\n&gt; There's a lot more people out there like this than you think.\n\nBut is there? I always see folks speaking about this demographic and I always see messages like \"there are more people out there who fit this description than you'd think!\" but it seems like all of the major cloud services are struggling. Stadia went the way of the dodo, and Microsoft/Nvidia's cloud gaming services remain niche.\n\nI'm not saying *nobody* is in that situation, but it doesn't seem like there's a substantial market of people who need cloud gaming.",

Does this market make up a large amount of the population, or do most people just want to play a handful of games a year?

Meanwhile, somewhere like the US is absolute hell where the US government spends billions to subsidize inefficient rural living with internet that makes it difficult for cloud distributors to support. \n\nThe hard solution to cloud gaming would to be to exclude people who don't live in population centers from using the service or just not bother with the NA market at all.",

So the latency, while definitely noticeable is just something that we get used to. \n\nSo far I had a lot of fun with the GP on my phone. The only game where I couldn't get past the extra latency was DJMax. Which I feel makes total sense, being a rhythm-based game and all. Until now I have played and/or beaten the whole Banjo series, Yakuza 3, Back4Blood and Forza 5. And I'm currently playing Soul Hackers. \n\nDo I feel it will substitute local gaming? Honestly, unless it stays cheap and the internet connection of half the world improves by a lot in the next couple of years. No, but I do feel it can be a fun companion to a console or PC.",

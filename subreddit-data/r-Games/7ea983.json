Besides, what other company would give an okay to something like Insaniquarium?",

We know what company made them, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. That dev is basically unknown because everybody only knows PopCap, not him. \n\nIf lots of people leave a company that means lots of experience leaves the company. If said company makes a sequel to one of their games, do they still have experience? Oftentimes that is something that gets mentioned after a shitty release when people got burned. A nice example is Diablo 3. Blizzard made Diablo 2, so they had plenty of experience, right? Well, no. The dev team behind D3 had basically nothing to do with D2. That's why they missed so hard on what is important in an ARPG/H&amp;S game. A lot of the changes RoS made, were actually community ideas, so Blizzard took a lot of time and effort into reading what the community wants after that horrible release, because they realized they had no clue what Diablo is about.\n\nEA bought Titanfall developer Respawn. They might force staff changes and then a shitty Titanfall 3 releases. But people will be like \"ooh, Titanfall 3 from Respawn! I'll get that\" even though completely different devs could be working on it.",

Any shaders that were written to give the props a particular look or special effect likely have to be modified or redone, and the textures will need updating if the new engine uses a different lighting model such as physically based rendering.\n\nThings get more messy when animated things get involved. For example with a character's facial animation and lipsync, if your old engine expected the face to be animated with bones and the new engine expected blend shapes, you have to completely redo all your work on creating that character's facial expressions.\n\nThe characters' animations are likely driven by a blend tree and state machine, which is going to be specialized to the engine as well.\n\nAdd to that the learning curve of having to pick up a bunch of new software you've never used before and you pay a major productivity price.",

Obviously CoD spawned a massive franchise, and were developed by Infinity Ward exclusively all the way through Modern Warfare 2 (with the exception of WaW, which was kind of meh), all of which were great games. Then the series, still developed by Infinity Ward (as well as Treyarch), kind of took a turn for the worse and Black Ops, MW3, Ghosts, AW, IW, etc all kind of get shit on by the public.\n\nMeanwhile, Respawn Entertainment kind of came out of nowhere and developed two pretty great games in Titanfall and Titanfall 2.\n\nI always thought it was funny that it was Jason West and Vince Zampella who came from 2015, Inc. (MoH: AA), founded Infinity Ward (CoD through MW2), left IW in 2009 (when CoD kind of went to shit), and founded Respawn (TF and TF2). Those guys are legends and absolutely prove the point to follow the people themselves and not the development/publishing companies.",

Also there's inconsistent cost to the live events and you can easily get screwed out of half your stamina with 3 failed attempts on a high profile event.\n\nI'll probably give up playing the game this week at this rate.",

I played it for quite a while.\n\nWhen Plants vs. Zombies 2 came out, I was well-aware of the inclusion of microtransactions but wanted to see how far I could progress without feeling the strain. I watched as the difficulty ramped up in a hilarious way, hoping to usher me to press a button that would require me to pay money. I stopped playing. It wasn't that the game was unmanageable, but, more often than not, these games stop feeling fair and that's when the challenge stops mattering to you. The illusion is broken. \n\n**Edit:** You people seem to be missing the point. I specifically said \"It wasn't that the game was unmanageable.\" It's that the focus by the developers had changed. No longer was the focus on creating a game that was simply fun to play, challenging but fair. **The inclusion of microtransactions is a poisonous root that infects the rest of the game, causing PvZ 2 to be arguably worse than its predecessor, despite the ability to complete it.**\n\nThere's this perception in the community that if you can complete the game without buying microtransactions, it nullifies all criticism. I'm afraid to say it but that's not how this works, guys.",

Go cheaper. And when suddenly there's a tonne of free games, the $5 look ridiculous... Especially as the free games start monetizing and eaning far more money. \n\nThe best selling Fire Emblem game, of the series entire lifespan is FE Heroes. And that makes a tonne more money than Mario Run.",

It's worse than mobile because microtransactions are popping up in full price $60-80 games, like what the actual fuck.

When that didn't work it became 'all levels free but you pay for other bits'. It snowballed from there and ended up *more* profitable to do this than it ever was to just have people buy the game upfront.\n\n\n\n",

Games are designed intentionally with needlessly annoying elements (timers, ridiculous jumps in difficulty, needing X number of a certain item to continue [X being unobtainable without boring grinding]) in order to get people to pay money to avoid those elements.  It's intentionally making a game worse and making people pay to avoid the bad parts.  There is no such thing as a game that is better from a player's perspective because they included microtransactions.  They are entirely a gain for the developer at the player's expense.\n\nMicrotransactions have killed innovation in mobile gaming and will kill innovation in PC and console gaming as well.",

PvZ 1 was a steady progression throughout the game, unlocking more and more plants, as the story built around you. You progressed to different areas around your house and the game mechanics built logically on that progression (e.g. getting water plants in the pool levels and mushrooms on the night levels), and it all felt like a cohesive whole experience. PvZ 2 on the other hand felt like garbage from the get go. Sure there were like 5 times as many levels, but there was no cohesion. You went from egypt world to pirate world to wild west world, and they would just throw random plants and enemies at you that made little sense together. Not to mention they showed all the great locked plants to you constantly, always reminding you that you're explicitly NOT getting the whole cohesive experience because you didn't pay extra for them. \n\nBasically, PvZ was clearly a product of love from all the developers - polished and thoughtful and fun, while PvZ 2 felt like a mish-mash of half baked ideas churned out for the sole purpose of driving microtransactions.",

Microtransactions should be optional stuff, and you should have fun without it. If you're just grinding or being frustrated, that's a failure of the system.\n\nBest example of a good microtransaction system I've seen is Smite. You get a lot of free stuff without paying or grinding, you can earn more relatively easily including cosmetics, and you can also pay for a complete game(at least in terms of the gods you can pick) in one lump sum.",

But the value of that service has always been pretty great even with the average subscription cost increasing from about $10 USD to about $20 USD per month in that time. These games are also pretty up front about being a service and disclosing what you get for your money.\n\nEven microtransactions are *okay*. I don't particularly like games where you can buy an advantage that affects game play, but I've even seen that done in ways that don't simply make people more powerful. But these microtransactions are only okay when they're disclosing exactly what you're paying for. Hell, if the game is good enough I've been known to go looking for a few cosmetics to buy just to support the developers a little more.\n\nI tend to use a trip to the movie theater as my standard for fun-per-dollar. That's about two hours of entertainment for about $15 per person where I live. I find some games are worth quite a bit more than their asking price, and I'll happily reward them for this. But more and more often games are worth less than their asking price (even if they're free) because the experience is built around begging for more money. I don't particularly enjoy casinos, so the whole loot box thing has always been a terrible value to me. Games of chance just aren't my thing.\n\nI've kinda strayed from my point. I don't think games as a service, nor microtransactions, are inherently bad. They're just things that are increasingly implemented in bad ways.",

All of these HAVE valid applications combating problems from the past (most specifically arbitrary obsolescence of shutting down games to force transitions to newer grounds).\n\nThe problem isn't these mechanisms. It is the specific application and the mindset/specific goals they are deployed with instead.\n\nGames as a service if done right allows for active longevity while allowing for distributing the costs naturally with the means of individual players in mind.\n\nAny system regardless of being a hot topic now or in the past are atrocious, if the goal implementing that is into pressuring and forcing people to maximise the revenue. It's the core difference between being a provider, or a predator. If you willfully play with frustration of customers with the goal of \"getting their money\" being the method to alleviate those frustrations, the specific systems don't matter, and scorching the earth for the systems rather than burning down the application of them isn't helpful, because it just means they will move to new pastures doing the same thing.\n\nRailing against 3D cinema instead of specifically \"just\" cash-grabs and putting lame applications of 3D on the market had the same negative effect. It doesn't just depress the cash grabs, it depresses application of the tech in ANY case, and deprives us of proper implementations at the same time.\n\nI am FOR incremental monetisation, provided that this is a mutual process rather than a coercive one.\nThe issues I have is with the big publishers not applying those systems as way of the audience rewarding the publisher and enabling them to carry on, but as method to focus on increasingly lopsided value propositions and pitting players against players and manipulating emotions.

In the end of the day they're still employees, EA's executives are still their bosses and showing them the middle finger will do nothing but ensure the next employee to be promoted to your position will follow their orders without too much questioning.",

Just make one really good game and keep improving it, use lootboxes for cosmetics only. You have a built-in playerbase that will keep buying cosmetics for years.\n\nInstead they have now spent a shitload of money developing and marketing 2 average Star Wars games that piss everyone off and the playerbase drops to almost nothing after 2 months.\n\nEveryone says EA is all about greed but to me they are like the guy that blows his paycheck every month and never saves. They just have very short-term thinking when it comes to profits. If they really wanted a good ROI they would use proven models that successful devs like Blizzard and Valve have already figured out.",

Popcap legitimately ***LOVED*** making their games. They truly wanted to foster positive fun gaming experience without the bullshit. Striving for accessibility for anyone was a huge core value. It was incredibly sad to see the layoffs happen (including my dad) and to see the games morph into a way to separate people from their money.. Every time I got to go into the Seattle office before EA, I felt welcomed by atmosphere. IDK about how it is now but I'd bet its not nearly as fun..",

I also read an article interviewing him or som,eone else from the company, and I haver somewhat conflated the two sources in my mind. \n\nBut this was back from when Popcap was the Next Big Thing and people _loved_ their games. And he was talking about their design philosophy and how much they cared about the little aspects of their games which made them so special - things like having designers spending hours just figuring out the best way for gems to fall in Bejeweled (they use some form of gravity so there's acceleration, it's not a fixed speed). Even though I can't remember exactly what was said in the speech the guy gave, it was very much about focussing on making great games and just knowing that they'd find their audience and they didn't need to rip people off or gouge them for money because the games spoke for themselves. \n\nAnd while I know ultimately there was a reason for them to accept acquisition by EA, they never made games in the same way after that.",

Just they're usually as young as people like us (I assume older based on \"who has the time\") used to when we were younger.\n\nThat or, as I've seen that mentioned a few times personally, people who have no children or any other huge commitments that they need to do after a typical work day and can spend their hours relaxing with a long game as a hobby.\n\nThere's quite a large demographic for time consuming games and more replays. Doubly so if they don't personally play any \"live service game\" or the sorts that would take up said free time due to daily/weekly objectives and can move from one really long game to another with ease.",

It\u2019s tangentially related for sure, but this is like the next big Atlus game by their absolute A-team. Like the other Atlus games have slapped for sure but Nocturne is considered one of the goats, and Persona 3-5 sort of revolutionised the genre in a way. This is them wanting to move onto a fantasy game next.\n\nAlso worth noting that the initial premise back when this was announced as project re fantasy 7 years ago was kind of riffing on the idea of the fantasy archetypes in the Arcana, and building a whole new fantasy world out of that. It\u2019s why their new sub-studio logo is an interpretation of the Fool arcana",

I don't think Persona 6 will be just as great as the trilogy made by these dudes, but it will not be terrible either. How they dealt with the mechanics and level design, for example in SMTV, it's pretty good actually... but the UI and especially the writing, the gap of talent between the new group and the Persona trio is very noticeable",

I thought P5 was a lot of fun and prefer fantasy settings, so \"P5 but fantasy\" is good enough for me, haha.\n\nBut I do wish the in-game visuals did a bit more to distinguish them. Both the menus and the environments look *fantastic* with a unique almost painting-like quality that fits the fantasy vibe, but the actual character models look ripped from Persona 5. Hopefully as the game approaches release they get touched up, I feel like changing the shading or something to make them look more like the backgrounds would help a ton there.",

The Hashino, Soejima and Meguro trio is easily my favorite \"developer leads\" in the gaming space because of their body of work. Hashino as a game designer, apart from the unique gameplay loop of modern Persona, also lead the team which spawned the Press Turn system of modern SMT, and the three of them are also behind Catherine which is such a unique experience both gameplay wise and as a narrative.\n\nHonestly kudos to Microsoft and Xbox for snagging this marketing deal and recognizing the potential in it. Shame also that this game might be the last time the three collaborate on this level, what with Meguro leaving Atlus and becoming an indie developer.",

Not that I wish they just announced P6 here, I'm glad they're trying something new with the gameplay formula, but I absolutely fell in love with the real-life settings of P4 and P5. Its cool to see RPG's go for that kind of thing over the usual fantasy or final-fantasy type setting.",

Persona games have a social/high school aspect and its a very significant part of the game.\n\nIn SMT games, the world is usually broken and overrun in some way by demons and you have a tool to summon your own to eradicate them. \n\nIn Persona games, the world is generally normal but is being influenced in some dark manner by demons that arent otherwise tangible.   They may be purely mental or electronic. The protagonist ends up with a tool to fight these demons and then observe those impacts on the real world. \n\nPersona games also have a different mechanic for team building. SMT games are all about collecting demons, fusing them, and having them directly serve in your party. Persona games still have the humans fighting, but they are augmented by the persona(demons) they wield. \n\nFwiw, my favourite smt games were:\n\n- SMT4\n- SMT strange journey\n- Persona 5\n- Smt devil survivor overclocked\n- Smt devil survivor 2 record breaker\n\nOf these, the devil survivor games were far and away my favourite. The stories are just so cool.  I gush when i talk about these games and i need to stop myself or ill spoil it. Im saddened buy the fact that there probably will not be a third.",

Exoprimal, yeah, had to search on google, lol this game is not looking good, but that's ok, it's a fair try.

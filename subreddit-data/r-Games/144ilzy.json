They've only revealed what 3 of them are: Gunslinger, Handler, and Challenger. The other 2 look like long rifle build (big rifle on shoulder, mask w/ hood) and possibly a mid-range build (smaller melee gear/club thing and maybe an SMG). My guess is we're getting 3-4 initially, then 1-2 are unlocks only. They've already said we will unlock archetypes by playing/finding events in-game. Gunslinger was the first trailer so I don't think they're holding it back as DLC, just a quick unlock. You'll be able to switch your archetypes like equipment. So regardless of when you get Gunslinger, you can switch it in immediately. Having it early just means you can work to unlock its special trait sooner, which you can then use independently of the 2 archetypes you equip as primary/secondary.",

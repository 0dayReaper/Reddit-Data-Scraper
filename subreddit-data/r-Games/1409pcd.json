    "postText": "Hi everyone!\n6 years ago, we started the development of our first turn-based strategy game, as 2 newbie devs. We\u2019re very excited to finally announce that Myriads: Renaissance, our lite 4X / City-builder is now available for purchase on Steam!\n\nSteam + Demo + Trailer: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737220/Myriads_Renaissance/\n\nAs a small 2 person team, our goal isn\u2019t to make the next big 4X game. Instead, we took a different approach and focused on delivering a shorter, more intense gameplay experience. Myriads is our personal contribution to the genre, and if you like the idea of a small but challenging 4X game with city-builder and tower defence mechanics then Myriads is the game for you!\n\nAnd if you\u2019re curious about the game but are not sure if you want to buy it or not, there is a demo! It offers 60 turns of gameplay which represents about 1 hour of gameplay. It also includes a step by step tutorial so that you won\u2019t get lost trying to understand our game. Give it a try!",

Really has the space for some interesting themes, and I think the overall premise and presentation are fantastic!\n\nCombat was nothing to write home about, but at least it didn't feel clunky or bothersome.\n\nA neat elegant package, can't wait to play more of it!",

Only problem I've had is, this is one of those \"be a nice guy or be Hitler\" games. There's a lot of nuance, of course, but I personally like more complex moral systems (or none at all)",

            "comment": "I played the demo and the writing was... mediocre. They tried to go for a Planescape Torment type of banter with the sidekick and most of the jokes did not land. Also, the protagonist seem to shift personalities in every other dialogue, there's no cohesion whatsoever. I hope the rest of the game is better in this aspect since everything else is quite well done.",

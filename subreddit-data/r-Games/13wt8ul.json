Good thing for the employees is that most likely a good part of them might be hired by Hal Laboratory, which they have been working with on Kirby games for years now",

Given that a large portion of their recent work was support for Kirby video games, it would make sense if HAL hired a large number of them.\n\nThe Switch era has been difficult for the smaller/quirkier \"not *actually* Nintendo 1st party, but basically may as well be\" studios, as evidenced by the closures of Skip, AlphaDream, and now Vanpool.",

The only thing I can think of is the boxboy that released on switch. Pushmo was great. Hell even that gacha arcade thing they had was entertaining for a quick short burst. I miss quirky weird Nintendo. Even Labo was a neat idea. Hopefully they have something cooking.",

It\u2019s been a bit since their last quirky game though. \n\nGuess Bayonetta Origins is pretty random, but it\u2019s still a franchise.",

You can also see this effect with some other publishers as well, like Atlus who used to release a ton of games on handhelds but have also slowed down in the frequency of releases since the end of the 3DS era.",

The other two were Skip, developer of Chibi-Robo, and Punchline, developer of Chulip. These games share a very specific and peculiar flavor that I haven't seen replicated in any other game. Vanpool was the final one in operation, so it seems that flavor may have just died out. Of course, they were primarily a support studio so they didn't have too much say on game direction and feel, but it's still interesting to think about to me.",

Gamefreak is keeping itself small, they co own the IP, get at minimum 10M+ sales per game, a portion of the merchandise goes to them, they don't need the help from the Pokemon company to expand if HAL is capable of keeping that headcount &amp; hopefully expand with ex Vanpool employees.",

But still even before reaching this number they already released a Kirby HD game in 2015 so their transition to HD already happened in the Wii U era and they didnt struggle like GF does.",

The Wolf Among Us was a distant second, followed closely by The Walking Dead Season 2.

They succeeded, but the third season was so bad that the fourth just couldn't pull back enough people to save them.",

That's where the success for TWD was at. It was super unique, not something you can just easily recreate. Brought in all these franchises, overcommitted, and flopped. I don't know anyone who played Minecraft Story Mode, or GotG. Just because those are good franchises doesn't mean I want to play a point-and-click story for them.\n\nI am not even a TWD fan outside of the Telltale series. Couldn't get into it at all. But if they could have struck gold again with more stories, I probably would have played them. But from what I heard, none of them really brought anything to the table worth checking out.\n\nSad.",

It was clear the team, like what happened with Vanguard Saga of Heroes, was self-appointing leaders and trying to release a game with no leadership at all.\n\nThis incompetence is so well-known that the people who ran the company are likely blacklisted, nobody I've checked on Linkedin is involved in AAA games anymore.",

They so wanted to be BioWare and pull a Mass Effect 2 ending, having wildly different outcomes that have massive impacts on the next installment. But as soon as season three came out it was obvious that they had nowhere near the resources to do such a thing, so they shoved Clem back to being a side-character and had the ending of S2 be completely meaningless.",

Like you select save Kenny in southpark only for Kenny to die anyway in the next scene because the game doesnt want to fork.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit - also of course its an issue if you want to play the game twice but thats basically like knowing the illusion to a magic trick,  it wont be magic anymore but you can still enjoy  the show.

Gives a good insight into the massive mismanagement that destroyed the company.\n\nTelltale basically took on way too many projects, all of which had expensive licenses. They hired a ton of new people to take on the extra workload, which made everything even more chaotic. Even with so many people, developers were stretched way too thin, and there was an atmosphere of permanent crunch time. This resulted in decreasing product quality. The creative leads all left, which left a bunch of less-qualified other people to take their places. Former CEO Kevin Bruner's habits of extreme micromanagement and driving away top project leads out of jealousy were a huge problem too.\n\nIf Telltale had kept their hands out of the Netflix cookie jar and fired Bruner instead of letting him drive away the TWD season 1 project leads, they would still be making high-quality games, instead of being bankrupt after not producing anything of value in the last 4 years.",

They go really really fast on their games which means they need a lot of employees to pay.

For context, there's a few scenes in season 4 where you have to move around an environment and kill zombies in real-time, and you can set off traps to kill them instead. It's still rudimentary compared to a proper action game, but worlds ahead of what they'd had up until now.",

Personally I thought games like Life is Strange did their whole thing better, and actually innovated instead of repeating the same stuff over and over. Back when Walking Dead came out there wasn't really a ton of storydriver indie games, now there are plenty good ones. \n\nI have said for a long time that I would love to see Telltale create a game in a orginal IP, really flex the creative muscles and not try to make it fit in an already established universe. Seems like that will never happen now.",

I was just waiting for them to stop making games for superhero IP's or things like Minecraft, and maybe for them to shake up their game design formula a bit. \n\nGaming in general just lost out a lot if they are confirmed as closed though. They made some mistakes but I'd much rather have them still making games. I have skipped a lot of them in recent years eventhough I've wanted to play a good adventure game by them since The Wolf Among Us. I just wanted some IP that interested me. They were bound to learn from their mistakes at some point, especially with some slightly less mainstream IP's on the horizon. It seemed like they got really sloppy and just wanted to churn out as many games with mainstream appeal as possible. Compare any of their games to the likes of Life is Strange. They got beat in quality in pretty much every way. ",

I know I enjoyed a bunch of the Telltale games, but I always bought them once the entire thing had become available so that I could play through the entire thing in a week or so. The bonus is that by that time you could always get them pretty heavily discounted, like in the $5-8 range. I also always find it curious to look at the user completion rates. On PSN you can see how many people who played the game earn certain trophies, and the Telltale game trophies are all just for completing each chapter. After the first episode it just falls off a cliff, I wonder if most people who buy the first episode then forget about it. ",

By the sounds of it, they probably grew too fast for their own good. There is something to be said for having measured growth and not getting ahead of yourself. I'm a dev (not a game dev though) and a previous consulting company that I worked for had a great strategy for this. They made sure to target a specific growth rate (somewhere around 5-10% annually IIRC) and any year they exceeded this, they made sure to pull back the next year.

Even 20 years on, there's a lot of hype when a new GTA is announced, but can you imagine that being the case if Rockstar was releasing 3-4 a year with the only significant difference being the license it's tied to?  At some point people are going to lose interest and look for something else to play, especially if it's coming in small chunks you can only get a few hours worth of enjoyment out of.  The model Telltale created might've allowed for multiple releases a year, but that doesn't mean it's a sustainable one.  They never gave the format any room to breath, and the rate they were releasing titles seems to have made it very difficult to take many steps towards innovation.",

I hope that quality does not suddenly drop because of these layoffs. Also, critical elements of the game are missing (that is supposed to be patched, according to Telltale). Endings such as the Wellington Ending, where you get &gt;!Kenny's hat!&lt; is nowhere to be found in the game. You also get a specific scar in that ending, that exists in the game files, but not the game. I hope these layoffs do not prevent crucial details such as this ending from getting patched in. \n\nSeeing Wolf Among Us 2 cancelled breaks my heart. I am also saddened that Tales from the Borderlands Season 2 will no longer come into fruition. Wishing the best for those laid off.\n\nEdit: I am now receiving word that The Final Season has been cancelled. I am still in shock and denial. I hope official word from Telltale de-confirms this.

A good comparison would be someone opening up a mom and pop restaurant, having great success, and suddenly opening up 5 new locations and hiring tons of people at each location. It's not that they weren't having success, it's more likely that they didn't grow responsibly.",

Just because you have a successfull game series doesn't mean that you can continue to pump out similar games and expect people to just buy your product.\n\nPersonally I think a lot of projects failed for very similar reasons: This one big success is carried by a temporary wave of attention and hype but once this wave passed by, you have to scale back and act responsibly. Given how many similar games (at least for my standards) they pumped out, I'm not at all surprised.\n",

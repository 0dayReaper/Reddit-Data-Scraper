The \"thwack\" when you get a headshot is so damn satisfying and honestly just makes the game for me. I also really enjoyed using the bow in Sons of the Forest, even though the game was a little half-baked on release.\n\nThey should make an FPS just totally built around bow mechanics. They are so fun to use.",

His legacy will live on.\"  He is so missed by so many gaming communities, I don't think another person will ever be so known, in so many communities, as TB was. Not being a player that is, and even then really, who cares about players in games they don't play.",

He combined that with a game that he was probably very interested in, and the knowledge that his viewers would want to know his thoughts on this game, and finally probably just a desire to purge negativity from his remaining life, and all of that added up to him giving up on the boycott.\n\nA lot of that is speculation on my part, but it's not too far fetched to believe.",

He loves ranting about bad practices and seems to revel in exposing bad indie games or obvious scam attempt, as well as scummy business practices.

It's something Sonic Team has continued to neglect the importance of all these years in their own developed 2D Sonic outings, considering how the physics were (one) of the highlights of the original games. Even Generations had its fair share of wonkiness (classic Sonic's spin dash in that for instance.)",

So when it became all about GO GO GO it felt weird to me.\n\nThat's because that's how they were meant to be played (I also did the same as you). The great thing about Sonic compared to Mario was that you *could* go fast once you knew the level well enough to memorise the layout, and get rewarded for it with lives and huge score, and maybe even reach otherwise unreachable areas. \n\nNewer Sonic games, as in, Unleashed onwards, or Advanced onwards on portable, were literally just games of \"*run forwards, FAST*\" to the point where you would often get killed or break the scripted loops or whatever if you *didn't*. That includes Colours that's highly praised by Sonic fans for some reason (only Colours was worse since it kept breaking the momentum with the stupid whisps switching). It ruined the franchise for me. Forces at least improved on that in the classic stages. \n\nI haven't tried Frontiers yet. But the focus on open world just makes it seem like it's the same, just not in a corridor, so I haven't prioritised playing it yet. Maybe in a sale.",

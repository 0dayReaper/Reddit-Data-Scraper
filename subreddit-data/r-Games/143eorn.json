It's very, very hit or miss if you'll experience it at all, or which specific corruption you'll get (there are multiple).\n\nThe best thing to do, on any platform, is back-up your saves every so often.  \nAnd for console this should be on a different drive/usb/sd card/etc. Don't rely on cloud backups on Steam or console as some people swear that that itself can cause corruption.",

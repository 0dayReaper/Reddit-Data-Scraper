This showcase literally had an etire segment dedicated to announcing a delay for one of their games (Pragmata). I've come to realize that Capcom is just not very good at this whole \"building hype\" thing. This show feels less like a show for fans and more like a shareholders presentation. LOL!",

I don't know, I've never thought the Capcom press announcements have ever been that impressive.  I prefer more traditional press conferences.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for pageantry, but the old shows which were controlled by Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were always much more exciting than the ones put on by the individual publishers.  I just don't love the way summer press events have evolved in general, and I think that the Capcom shows are a prime example of what I don't like.",

The only feature that was actually properly implemented to completion was... the pawn AI.\n\nSo it seems more like a \"remake, and let's make it for real this time\" than a sequel.",

I never pleayed Dragon's Dogma, and really felt like there was some coop online when I saw the two characters giving a high-five to one another on the first trailer. It made me buy the previous game, which I'm currently enjoying a lot, but I definitely wasn't able to understand that it was an AI party only through the first glimpse they gave us.\n\nAnd since Dragon's Dogma is a franchise that had enough problems to make it not having a really big fanbase (although one that shows true love and appreciation for the game), I think it's possible to say that it's a niche game for now, so see them explaining what the game is for people who never played it, ike me, isn't too far fetched. It worked, at least, cause I bought the first, and now I'm definitely gonna play this new one as well.\n\nBut I can understand how annoying it must've been for an old fan expecting surprises on the announcement.",

Saying that these things exist in the sequel hardly constitutes an update. It very well may be a cultural thing, where Japan is just very coy about announcing things in advance. I know Japanese developers are notoriously secretive about stuff.",

There is a limit to how much a video game AI can understand the context to use some skills so I don't see how co-op could do anything but straight up enhance the experience.",

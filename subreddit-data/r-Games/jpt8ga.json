It will be available in Spring 2021 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, with forward compatibility and targeted enhancements on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. More information to come in the new year!\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile here at BioWare, a veteran team has been hard at work envisioning the next chapter of the Mass Effect universe. We are in early stages on the project and can\u2019t say any more just yet, but we\u2019re looking forward to sharing our vision for where we\u2019ll be going next.\n&gt; \n&gt;",

Andromeda was clearly just the first chapter, so many quests and plot points in the game were only a build-up for things to come. Despite the many flaws of the game in technology, narrative and gameplay, I'm quite looking forward to the next one.\n\nA remaster however, even one as much asked for as this one, never reaches the same audience than the original releases. It won't have the same budget, marketing and hype as a new release. I just played through the orignal trilogy in September since I was between jobs and had a month off, and I was quite happy with the nostalgia of playing the aged first title.",

The characters and story quest are great. But it feels like the game is trying to waste my time at every opportunity it gets by making me do boring shit, like side quests that reminds me of MMOs from the early 2000s and timers from shitty mobile games. The open worlds also feels tacked on and disconnected from the rest of the game. \n\nThe gameplay itself wasn't bad but the tactical mode was buggy as hell (played on PS4, a friend told me it was better on PC) which made it a chore to use. I really feel like if they improved it and put more effort into designing challenging encounters it could be something really special. I wouldn't be surprised if they instead removed the tactical view from the sequel though, since I doubt many used it.",

Presumably for the secondary characters they chose the ones they liked the most - or thought the community likes the most.  Hence we have Garrus given the highest billing (as it should be) followed by Liara and Tali.  That's no surprise but what's curious is who else is there - particularly Miranda and Thane.  They're no more significant in game than other characters who didn't 'make the cut' (e.g. Legion, Jacob) but clearly Bioware thinks they're popular enough to boost sales.  They're probably right.\n\n(Nice to see Anderson sneaking in as the sole non-crew character.)",

As a huge fan, I couldn't get into Andromeda..even though the gameplay wasn't bad, it just felt kind of soulless.

I barely remember them, but I'm certainly interested in trying them all over again!\n\nIt's interesting that this is handled like the Master Chief Collection. One launcher for all the different games. Seems the multiplayer for Mass Effect 3 isn't included, sadly. I heard it was pretty good.",

It\u2019s always gonna look kind of like muppets (because that\u2019s essentially what they are)\n\nNowadays facial animation would likely be done with mesh deformations which allow more nuanced and fluid expressions, and if it\u2019s a more realistic style they\u2019d probably do face scans and performance capture. But it requires a completely different production pipeline to do that. It would mean remaking a good chunk of the original games\u2019 content if they were going to attempt that which would be super cool but it doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re going that far with this remaster.",

Character models in particular are atrocious; every time I replay it, I sit there and lament how hard it is to make a good looking Femshep.

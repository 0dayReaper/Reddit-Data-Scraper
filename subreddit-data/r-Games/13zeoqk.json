Doom was so massively popular at the time, everyone at my school playing the game on their \"lightning fast\" intel 386 or 486 PCs.\n\nFast forward a year later and he's back in town visiting his girlfriend. I get word from my roommate that they want me to come over to play an early test build of the game. I'm too busy with school so I don't make it, plus I still thought the guy was an idiot for making that bold claim about making a game better than Doom.\n\nMaybe a year and a half later,  the game comes out to really positive reviews in the gaming magazines and I suddenly feel like I'm the real idiot.  I bought the game and I loved it. The dude was right, in some ways it was better than Doom, especially in terms of atmosphere and story.\n\nIt definitely didn't become as popular as Id's Doom, but it was really successful and it pushed the boundaries of what FPS shooters could do, and like you said, it did reach cult classic status.",

(tbf was because it was all MTX'd or something at first, I remember the circlejerk fondly)\n\nweirdly jealous of my buddies for succumbing to the FOMO and paying to get D4 access now, but honestly, seeing as it came to $109 CDN for the Poverty Edition, fuck that. I have my limits, just buying the game on launch day after Diablo Immortal and all the other ActiBlizz bullshittery kinda snuck past them",

But there is a plot with a beginning, middle, and end.  Though admittedly there could have been more leading to the end so it doesn\u2019t feel as abrupt.  It\u2019s also something that very much feels like the middle chapter in a trilogy, though I\u2019d say it\u2019s overall better than a game like Mass Effect 2 which also served the same function in its series.\n\nWhere the game really shines and is absolutely worth the playthrough is for the side content.  That\u2019s where the real meat and potatoes are and almost every bit of it connects to Jensen\u2019s own personal story.  There is a plot element in that sense which is hinted and expanded upon in the side content, and I\u2019d be shocked if it didn\u2019t lead to something in a potential Mankind Divided sequel.\n\nThe city of Prague is also one of the densest video game locales/hubs out there, and nearly every bit of it\u2019s packed with something to find whether in terms of side content or environmental storytelling.  It\u2019s outstanding and I highly recommend playing with waypoints and objective markers turned off as well.\n\nAlso, I wouldn\u2019t worry about any microtransaction tomfoolery with the game.  It\u2019s one of the most blatant examples of \u201clast-minute publisher additions\u201d out there, as the game was clearly balanced without them in mind.  There will never be a point where you think to yourself \u201cDamn, if I only spent that extra cash on a few biocells\u201d, as you will have more than enough consumables/praxis kits throughout the game to get you by; by the end you\u2019ll be practically swimming in them.",

I have some of the DLC for MD but there is more on the Store, if there is Story stuff, I feel like I should maybe buy that *first* this time..there's nothing egregerious like *that* that is wrong with MD, it's still a solid game nontheless?",

If you wanna play a stealth build and avoid combat, you can absolutely do that and the game doesn\u2019t throw curveballs at you in the form of outsourced boss battle or anything like that.  It applies the lessons learned from HR very well in terms of gameplay and balance.  I\u2019d say the only thing all builds should have, and it\u2019s not because of any bullshit but because it\u2019s just that damn useful, is remote hacking (when it becomes available).\n\nThe DLC is interesting.  None of it is like Missing Link was in HR, where it\u2019s directly in the main story.  One of them is a mission that was fairly clearly cut early in development and repurposed to be a standalone mission, though I don\u2019t think it was for nefarious purposes; the mission is honestly redundant, and after playing the main story, you can see why it wasn\u2019t really needed in the grand scheme of the things.  Still, cool little mission that has some additional context, but nothing serious or major.\n\nThere\u2019s the DLC with Pritchard which is okay.  It has elements of that weird breach mode that SquEnix really tried pushing as the MTX vehicle of the game, but it\u2019s nothing egregious and worth playing just for Pritchard\u2019s return.\n\nThe last DLC, and most interesting one is A Criminal Past.  It\u2019s a prequel to the events of the main story, but is a retelling of events from Jensen towards another character.  It details a mission Jensen did before going to TF29 in Prague, but I advise not playing it (or any of the DLC missions) until after playing the main story.  It\u2019s better experienced after seeing how the main plot unfolds.",

Meaning somewhat abstract and maze like, rather than realistic.\n\nIf you are looking for something similar but with more modern level design, Prey is an amazing game. System Shock 2 is somewhere in between in terms of design. All 3 are great games that take place on a space station, with horror vibes.",

Compared to Thief, which is perhaps the closest contemporary in terms of release date you are familiar with, System Shock's map design is VERY confusing and archaic. You will want to reference the map often, although it can also be confusing because it doesn't always convey verticality. They explain it away in the lore of course but it feels hammy. \n\nThat being said it kinda helps making it a game that rewards exploration like few others do, so it's not all bad.\n\nTo be honest though, as the first ever \"Immersive Sim\", it's almost scary how much they got right, outside of the archaic controls. The original creators were geniuses, not divine savants, after all.",

You'll immediately understand what I mean, since you're put in a room with tons of useless things to add to your inventory. There is an early puzzle that is both difficult and confusing. Enemies in the first area kick your ass (not counting the first 3 or 4). Sometimes you'll be searching for a switch on the wall and it takes a bit to find because everything sort of blends together in the visual mess created by doing a 1:1 transformation of old videogame textures. The level design feels a lot like early 90s shooters where the rooms are blocky mazes.",

I haven't tried it myself (for me figuring out the puzzle of how to solve the objectives, and in some cases what they even are, is a huge selling point), so I don't know how granular it is, but you should probably give it a shot.\n\nIt does definitely take a bit to figure out the visual language of the game, but it's pretty consistent with what is and is not important: usable pickups have a glow of some sort, functional weapons have a reflective sheen, and interactable buttons are a specific shade of green.\n\nThe level design is cramped and confusing, but that's for a reason. It's basically a non-linear puzzle labyrinth. It's certainly not for everyone, but I think of all the old classic games, SS holds up better than almost all of them. I played the enhanced edition for the first time ~3 years ago expecting a janky but interesting relic, and was very pleasantly surprised by how modern it felt (after the control modifications from the EE, the original controls are hilariously weird).",

But at the end of the day it is exactly what it is, a PC only (currently) remake of a PC only game from 1994 in a genre that has never been truly successful.

This allowed Night Dive to take those basic tiles, add 3D detail, and bam, upgraded environments.\n\nSS2's environments, on the other hand, were borne of an era when 3D engines were just starting to be able to depict realistic spaces. The level geometry forms actual shapes. There are no simple tiles to update. To upgrade SS2's maps to a modern standard, Night Dive would have to throw out everything but the basic layout of the rooms and rebuild the levels from scratch, as if they were making a modern game. No tiles, no low-res pixelated textures, no shortcuts.\n\nAnd speaking of scope, SS2 has MUCH more complex systems than SS1. It has the entire stealth system inherited from Thief. More complex weapons and damage modeling. Melee that's way better than what we got in the SS1 remake. OS upgrades. Software upgrades. Armor. Implants. Research. Psi powers. Stats. Skills. They would have to reproduce all that. The same people who didn't even manage to reproduce SS1's MFD games.\n\nAnd frankly, I don't trust Night Dive's aesthetic sense. Their SS1 remake is full of little stupid features that they stuck in there because they're \"cool\". Like all the unskippable use animations that unequip your weapon and prevent you from interacting with anything else, or how item descriptions appear one character at a time instead of all at once, or how rechargers blast lightning bolts all over the place every time you use them (would YOU use a charger that did that?).",

One of the techs used in the game 'Looking Glass' is a not so subtle nod to Looking Glass Studios who made System Shock.\n\nThe story is the villain. Shodan is easily one of the best I've ever ran into. Space ship, evil AI in control of the whole thing trying to kill you, and the game doesn't hold your hand at all - good luck. It's a good time, but it's not modern by any standards which Arkane put their touch on it. Arkane games feel a bit dumbed down in other ways though, trying to make it appeal a bit more to wider audience.",

                    "comment": "Not the same. Prey is more like System Shock 2, which expanded heavily over the original. Calling System Shock an immersive sim in the same way is a bit of a misnomer, though it was inspired by Ultima and other Looking Glass Games which were.\n\nSystem Shock 2 added skills, stats, and Psi powers, none of which were in the original nor the remake. You had to build around the type of weapons you'd use as they had skill requirements, similar to Prey. If you wanted to use a Grenade Launcher you NEEDED at least 1 point in Heavy just to equip the thing.\n\nWhereas in System Shock you can use whatever you want so long as you have the ammo and inventory space to hold it. Inventory management is more akin to a survival horror than an immersive sim, with it faciliating scarcity of resources since you can't just pick everything up.\n\nWeapons in the original System Shock were mostly a tiered affair, like a progression system. The minipistol would eventually be replaced outright by the assault rifle, the SMG would eventually be your bread and butter because it just wrecked shit at the point you got it, most laser rifles were better than their pistol-like counterparts, etc.\n\nI find the remake offers more genuine choice in this regard to be more immersive sim like. Ammo economy has been adjusted across the board with the assault rifle being a lot more viable in the remake than it was in the original dude to the ammo being significantly more common later in the game, whereas the SMG is even easier to spam now since it shares the same common ammo as the pistol.\n\nThe remake also added new weapons such as the shotgun and rebalanced other weapons entirely like the plasma rifle which now only has 2 firing modes, one of which uses ammo whereas in the original it only used various degrees of energy.\n\nSo tl;dr: It's not really like Prey at all so it's a bit hard to compare 1:1. Prey has far more depth to the gameplay in the same way System Shock 2 did over the original, but the OG is still a fantastically good game.\n\nI think it invokes more sense of dread and horror than Prey did, personally. I *love* Prey, do not get me wrong, it's one of my favourites of all time, but SHODAN, the various cyborgs, and System Shock 2's \"The Many\" are just so much better antagonists.",

Then they put it back in again for SS2 and Deus Ex, to somewhat mixed reception at the time, and then Levine went on to throw it away again for Bioshock... and so on and so on, the pendulum swings on.",

I really wanted to like SS, but ended up refunding it for a few reasons.\n\n* The combat was not satisfying. You shoot enemies and they barely react. They just stand there and keep shooting at you. \n* Too many junk items cluttering up the world. Makes it very hard to tell what's interactable and what isn't because everything is the same color and every surface has lights on it.\n* UI/UX sucks. You aim at an object and instead of the name popping up over the object, it's at the top of the screen. So you're constantly moving your eyes to the top of the screen instead of focusing on what's in front of you. Same deal with the inventory. There's a little window on the right side of the screen that tells you what you're mousing over, so my eyes are darting between the mouse cursor and that window. It's fatiguing. \n    * There was also no option to turn off rumble on my controller. I was playing with Mouse and Keyboard, so when my controller started vibrating loudly on my desk, it gave ME a system shock!\n* Cyberspace is a neat idea, but in execution it wasn't very fun. It's a fully 3 dimensional shooter that feels like it should be more action packed with pick ups and points and stuff, but there wasn't any of that. Didn't seem to be much of any point in killing the enemies as opposed to just flying past them. And I got stuck because, just like the combat, there is almost no reactivity when you shoot things. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to shoot to progress. There was a big glowing fire thing, which I shot it 5 or 6 times to no effect. Turned out I had to shoot it 7 times.\n\nI get that a lot of this was to mimic the old game design, but a lot of these issues are cosmetic. The graphics look good as stills and videos, but I don't think the art design works well for a game that needs to be readable at a glance.",

I can get why it wouldn't fit well with a lot of people but I thoroughly loved System Shock 2 and it's *very* cool to go back and play the first game with minimal changes except for graphics and bringing it into modern controls/UI.",

Doesn't really affect anything, but it's a neat touch. Can't remember if the audio log was also there in the original though.\n\nSpoiler: &gt;!TriOptimum designed the Citadel station to be unpleasant to live in/navigate to see how it would affect people psychologically. Basically seeing how long it takes for people to get space cabine fever!&lt;",

Feels a bit more like Resident Evil, maybe, than a traditional fps. It's more about the resources than the action, sort of.",

Then the sh.t hits the fans, you are getting swarmed, ambushed or are up against Cortex or other bosses. At that point you just enable shield and your plasma rollers, perhaps to bring out that rapier, and suddenly it turns from very slow horror tactical shooter into twitch shooter with a speed that would make Doom Guy proud.

The level geometry is just so Doom-like (as a specific example, there is one room with three security monitors down in the Reactor level, but each monitor is a square floor-to-ceiling display, separated from one another by another square wall tile).\n\nI can appreciate that they wanted to be ultra faithful, I just wish it had been tweaked slightly more to take the core from \"screams 'I'm from the mid-90s'\" to \"says 'I'm from the mid-90s'\".",

It can be very obtuse, your objectives are said in audio logs (that you can miss). And the times they do explicitly tell you what to do, they are still quite vague about it. Some situations are unfair (good old monster closets basically). Maps are large and labyrinthine. And cyberspace is..still in the game unfortunately.\n\nThe game is really a coat of paint on top of the original. It feels like playing the original, but with a better control scheme, better inventory and better graphics/sound. And if you are ok with that, 10/10 recommend it. If you like a more modern approach to gameplay, but still want the SS experience, play Prey 2017.",

I was maybe 8 or so.\n\nWith the remake, the nostalgia hit so hard I felt the same feeling of fear from when I was a kid. I had to put it down after maybe an hour the first day.  Even the enhanced edition didn't do that for me, although that maybe because it was too close to the original and I had already conquered that fear.",

The gameplay was kinda interesting, coming up with ways to traverse the landscape was cool but I wasn't blown away. The combat bits were terrible. The story and world had sooooo much potential, but in the game 90% of the story is just exposition dumps given to you by holograms. The high concept artsy story concepts don't land nearly as well as they did in the MGS games. Theres a potential great game somewhere in there, but Kojima just fucks about so much it gets lost in all the noise. I know it's popular to say fuck Konami (and I agree), but it was probably a good thing having them on his case setting deadlines and making him focus.",

Kojima hinted as much when he said something along the lines of, \"I'll need to make another Strand game to fully realize the concept\", just after DS launched.\n\nNotwithstanding that comment, so much of the game seems transparently rushed from story beats to half-assed mechanics that come and go in the blink of an eye. Boss battles play like they're out of a beta, and most of the game's story is backloaded onto the final 2 hours.\n\nOne might say this is typical Kojima, and I would agree; I think he ate up his allowance and misjudged priorities as he did with MGSV. As it stands, Death Stranding is a middling conceptual indie-esque game with pretentious sci-fi tropes. And as a Stockholmed Kojima enjoyer, I can't wait for the sequel.",

Seriously, watching the end credits to his Metal Gear games feels like watching a comedy / parody as his name appears about 100 times over the course of the credits.",

Miyamoto, not so much; even though he\u2019s basically the godfather of video games, he lets his games speak for themselves. \n\nCase in point: I\u2019ve been playing video games since the 80s and I had to google Miyamoto to make sure he was in fact the Mario creator. I didn\u2019t have to do that with Hideo. Not because Hideo is the better or more influential creator, but because he built his career around making sure players know his name.",

That's what things do ultimately, they change with time...\n\nThat caveat out of the way: Miyamoto was probably the only specific individual game developer that could be named by any gamer I knew about ~10 years ago. Kojima could be named by his specific fans, but essentially if you didn't play his games or wish to play his games, you had no idea who he was or that he existed. People who had never played a Nintendo game could name drop Miyamoto. Even people that didn't play video games could rarely but still non-zero times name drop him. Similar with John Carmack back in the day before he became obsessed with rockets and VR and stopped being associated with games.\n\nNow it's entirely plausible that Miyamoto's celebrity has shrunk over the years as he's taken more and more of a back seat. That said, I am deeply skeptical of the claim that Kojima is the best known game developer in the world. It has the same feel to it as someone claiming that Miyazaki would qualify for the same title. It's a conclusion that's exceptionally biased by the sociological bubbles we exist in for these kinds of conversations.",

MGS2 is probably still his most polarizing game to date. It's a sequel to a top 3 PS1 game, which itself is a sequel to a top 10 MSX2 game, which itself is a sequel to another top 10 MSX2 game, which was his first ever game. \n\nSo prior to this lucky break, the three previous games in the franchise were already critically acclaimed. Disagree with those ratings if you want, but can you really say it's just luck? Especially since he also made the cult classics of Zone of the Enders, Snatcher, and Policenauts. And all of this is before what is regarded as one of the greatest games of all time: MGS3. \n\nHe must be a very lucky man.",

It's a stricter representation of their idea than if studios, other writers/creative directors/whoever had more say than them over the finished product.\n\nIt's kind of like democratic vs authoritarian. An auteur is more authoritarian in their production, because they have the creative freedom to dictate that everything is just how they want it. They can and do take queues from others on the project, and a large team helps make the whole thing happen, but nobody has creative input by default. \n\ntl;dr the creator of the thing maintains strict control over how it's made. Everyone else's work is credited, but the creative vision has a more singular drive.",

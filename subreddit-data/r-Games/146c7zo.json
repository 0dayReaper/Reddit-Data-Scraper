EA was particularly focused on monetizing the used games market there for a while\n\nThere were some pretty bad (for the time; kinda usual now) micro transactions too. Felt like they used Skate 3 as a testing front",

I just cannot wrap my head around how we've shifted to a point where paying $0 for games is actually the norm. Shouldn't games (or any product in general) cost money? Now, obviously it doesn't feel good on the customer when they buy a game (or any product) and it comes with a bunch of issues. That being said, F2P is not the good deed people think it is. You aren't seeing games removing their barriers to entry out of the kindness of their heart. Their plan is to get you in other ways, like with MTX.\n\nIdk man, as someone who plays Destiny 2, a game that switched to F2P half-way into its life, and in general an overall big departure from what Destiny 1 was; and as someone who plays Halo Infinite, a F2P, Live Service game, and in general an overall big departure from what Halo was in the past, the 2 things that both the Halo and Destiny community strongly agree on is that, F2P only hurt the game more than it did any good.\n\nAnd I'm not even gonna lie, I'm someone who thinks even MTX in F2P games still isn't acceptable. I do not give a fuck if they're just cosmetic, and I do not give a fuck if they have to \"make money somehow.\" You make your money by selling the game itself and then selling subsequent DLC later on. I do not give a fuck if this comment makes me sound like some old head boomer fuck; I would rather earn shit than buy shit and it's that simple. I don't care if they're only cosmetic, and I don't even care if they cost $1. I want to EARN shit.\n\nFor the record... &gt;!I've been playing in some of the Playtests for skate., and it really does feel like Skate, so kudos to them on nailing that part. That being said, I think we're at a point where people are tired of these monetization schemes and I think skate. will end up being a game where people say, \"Fun game that's ruined by horrible monetization\" in a similar aspect to games like Halo Infinite and Destiny 2.!&lt;",

In World of Warcraft, you can mix and match gear appearance any way you want as long as you collected that piece of gear at some point.  The amount of time that I spend in that window is probably absurd... I wish there was a statistic I could look at for that, but point being, I think it's an important thing for a lot of people because you see it everywhere in World of Warcraft.  **EVERYBODY** does it because they can.  You never really see anybody running around with the real appearance of what they really have equipped.\n\nThe number of people that would pay for cosmetics I think is a different thing, but for RPGs... they're roleplaying games.  You're playing a role.  You're supposed to be immersed in this world.  I think a lot of people care about not looking like clown vomit running around in the world, and in a game like World of Warcraft with that system in place, it shows.  Let me put it this way... in the upcoming Final Fantasy game, if they put the main character in a pink jumpsuit and gave you no option to switch out of it, because who cares about how the character looks, people would riot.  People absolutely care.  Whether they care enough to pay for it or not... that's something else, but that's why the whole paying for cosmetics thing exists in the first place.",

Like.... what?  \n\nI really don't think the \"playing a role\" part of rpgs matters to many people. Its more about numbers go up. Gameplay systems in RPG's are the draw, along with (usually) longer playtimes, and more interesting writing. Like, to continue with the WOW example, RP servers are completely fucking dead, and have been since time immemorial. There are a few pockets of activity but they are small and not significant. Same as in ff14. They legitimately quarantined their single rp server because most people didn't give a fuck, and didn't want to see those people. \n\nMost final fantasy games do basically put you into a stupid jumpsuit with no way to change it lol. I can't think of any decent looking protag in a final fantasy game. They are either edgelords, or stupid assholes. And I say that as a FF fan since kindergarten. Here is a dumb looking monkey man, here is an edgelord with an enormous fur trim, here is a guy with the stupidest pants ever, here is the most generic kpop man ever, etc etc etc i don't think anyone actually cares.",

All you have to do is *look* at the characters running around in WoW.  It's *undeniable*.  The only part of the game you can really point to and say the majority of the people that you see don't care about it is when you're levelling, because you're replacing gear all the time and every time you replace a piece of gear, the appearance for that piece of gear is the real one and nobody goes back to a transmogging NPC every time they get a new piece of gear to set their appearance back to what it was because they'd be doing it every 20 minutes.\n\nIf you don't understand it, that's fine, but it doesn't change the reality that a lot of people do care.  If cosmetics weren't selling, they wouldn't sell them.  Because they *do* sell, practically every game has cosmetics now... if not directly purchasable in-game, then as pre-order bonuses.  Some games run on only selling cosmetics and nothing else... like the game is free and they make their money through cosmetics.  That would not be possible if nobody were buying cosmetics.",

In the gaming industry (or really any entertainment industry), there is an equilibrium point between consumer and producer that will eventually be met, and we\u2019re getting to that point with monetization. The trends people fear about devs/publishers pulling are things they\u2019ve already pulled and we\u2019ve already slogged through. Back in 2015-2018, monetization was really bad; you had devs very obviously cutting up games and selling them piecemeal, with games also offering mtxs that grant player advantage; and as a result, the industry really suffered during that time. Nowadays, everything is cosmetic unless the game is F2P, and that\u2019s why the vast majority don\u2019t have an issue with it anymore, because it\u2019s completely ignorable for those not interested.\n\nPeople also like to cite that current monetization is why game quality has dropped so much, but I disagree. Both points are separate and a product of the industry booming in popularity over the last decade and everything becoming more corporate as a result (this isn\u2019t something you can \u201cstop\u201d). Could monetization get worse? Of course it\u2019s a possibility. But I genuinely don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely as the industry is at the point where it would suffer more than the consumers if they tried to go all-in again. So now we\u2019re at the point where mtxs are largely non-intrusive to the base experience and just another part of the industry.",

It doesn't matter if you could maybe get hundreds-thousands of hours of enjoyment and all you pay is nothing, because in actuality all it does is spit in your face as a Halo fan.\n\nAnother game for example, Destiny 2, is a shell of what it once was ever since it went F2P, adopted the Seasonal Model, and leaned heavily into MTX. I'm a 9-Year Destiny Veteran, and I find it comical how Bungie was acquired by Sony for their Live Service expertise yet Destiny 2 has only been a horrible mess of a Live Service game. Shit, just recently Bungie announced a price hike to how much each Season costs, going from $10-$12, but the content and rewards don't get any better. You'd think the extra money they rake in would mean the game only gets better, but realistically it doesn't.\n\nAnd these are only 2 games in a long list of F2P games that in all honesty are not worth playing even as free. COD Warzone is free and you couldn't pay me enough to play it. Fortnite is free and you couldn't pay me enough to play it. Apex Legends is free and you couldn't pay me enough to play it. And the list goes on.",

                    "comment": "I hate that Halo Infinite isn't more trashed than it is.  *Conceptually*, they ripped multiplayer out of the package that you typically paid full price for.  The idea of \"oh but it's free\" is **ridiculous**.  They took multiplayer out of the package and you're still being asked to pay full price for Infinite.  The multiplayer going free to play was an excuse to shield themselves from the bullshit they tried to pull with the way they wanted to run it instead of giving you proper multiplayer.  And yes, I get that everything was essentially free with Game Pass because I'm sure that's how most people bought into this whole thing... but this is the point of what I have a problem with.\n\nThis shit has been devalued so much that people are just complacent and very \"whatever\" about it because they weren't asked to spend a lot of money on the whole thing.  Most of the public out there who actually played the thing were less mad than they otherwise would've been if they plopped down full price for that because they did not have the same monetary investment in it.  Phil Spencer himself is out there saying that releasing great exclusive games isn't going to sell systems.  What kind of attitude is that to have?  Is that why Halo Infinite and Redfall are the way they are?  Because who cares right?  They aren't going to move systems regardless and we're essentially releasing them for free through Game Pass so who gives a shit about standards and quality because it's not costing anybody anything right? \n\nThe real cost is what gets caught in the middle of all of this horseshit... y'know, the games in and of themselves.  Their flagship franchise that used to be a system seller is now liquid-shitting the bed and all the fans that deserve better got bupkis.  If Game Pass were not a thing and they had the balls to charge you full price for this stuff, I don't think they would've released at the quality that they did, because most people would've said \"fuck you, try again\", but now with Game Pass people are like \"I'll give it a play anyway since I'm already subscribed\", and for me, that's the core of why I hate free to play so bad.  It's a completely different thing to ask people to pay full price up front for something, because you have an expectation to meet and you need to deliver on it or else you're not getting that money from most people.  Free to play fucks all of that up and it shows in a lot of free to play games.  The twist for Game Pass is... those games essentially are free to play under the Game Pass system.  They're technically not, but if you're subscribed to Game Pass, and I would imagine most people that have an Xbox Series are subscribed, then they essentially are free to play.  So what happens to the quality of those games?  There's less of a need to \"come correct\" with a game release because people will play it anyway.",

                            "comment": "Yeup. Say it louder for the sycophants in the back!\n\nA game that is free to play, but designed with that model in mind - which usually means the quality of the experience is compromised in some way - is not the same as a traditional game being free instead of being $20/$40/$60 ($99 AUD).\n\nEvery single F2P game that I have played is always, always a worse experience - quality, production values, value of the package, all of it - than if the same game was designed in the more traditional sense of a full, paid-for product. \n\nThe only exception of F2P games that didn\u2019t feel compromised in this way were Rocket League, and Destiny 2. These are both games that became F2P, but were released as traditional games, meaning they have the model of a F2P game now, but the quality of the core game itself is a full product made to be paid for. And again, those games too became worse experiences with the changes that came with F2P.\n\nThere are 2 things I think that are a benefit of F2P games. The ability to try out a game without any upfront investment, as some others have mentioned here as well as the OP subject, does remove barriers for accessibility, and I agree is a good thing for the populations of multiplayer games, as well as scenarios where you are trying to get cautious friends to try a game out. So I don\u2019t think the whole idea of a free to start/try/play game is inherently bad. The issue is that this isn\u2019t just an option for people that way inclined, but the core model that they game is built around, which creates a game that is indeed free to play, but not really good enough to be worth playing at all for some people, such as the people who would rather pay a set price for a quality experience. \n\nThe second thing that F2P games - which are almost all live service as part of the model - can do is create the living, evolving experience that the live service mode promises, and to be honest this is the kind of thing I used to imagine with wonder about when I was younger for my favourite games. Again, the issue is that I was imagining this experience in terms of games like Halo 3, CoD MW2, Red Dead Redemption (multiplayer), which at that quality, of course I would want it to keep going. But in reality that\u2019s not what live service has been, but rather a *maybe* comparable quality package delivered in pieces and stretched over a a period of time. And that\u2019s if it lasts that long, and doesn\u2019t die because the game itself isn\u2019t good enough to maintain paying players. \n\nAnd then you factor in the monetisation practices characteristic of games designed as F2P, which result in a slightly uncomfortable, artistic and entertainment compromised experience at best, or a manipulative, predatory product at worst, and there plenty more to talk about. \n\nSo yeah, I agree, free to play and similar models that have popped up in the last couple generations of the games industry have done a lot of harm and very little good, besides for the people making money off them. \n\nIt may be a small thing, but games mean a lot to me, as a medium to experience something meaningful, or as a way to have fun and chill out with friends. Watching games I\u2019ve loved like Halo, CoD, Skate, Gears, as well as so many promising new games, hell even chance for another DLC from Rockstar like Red Dead: Redemption Undead Nightmare due to the success of GTA: Online and shark cards, become swallowed up by this kind of greed, and lack of integrity is so disheartening. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more disappointing, that or the fact that the buying public, of which the majority seem to have slowly just become ok with it.\n\n\u2014-\n\nWell this turned into a bit of a vent lol. And he\u2019s, I also agree that things like F2P and Gamepass has contributed to the devaluing of games, and is resulting is lower quality games. I like Phil, but hearing him diminish the value of making great games was pretty bleak. As I said, Halo and Gears are some of the games closest to my heart, and that\u2019s because they were made with passion and quality to make a good games, and for me great games. That\u2019s why I bought an Xbox each time, and that\u2019s why I was excited of the notion of all Xbox exclusives also being playable on PC through gamepass/the Xbox app. But what has since been a part of that is not the great experiences that made me buy my Xboxes, and with Phil saying this I now understand why. And that\u2019s a damn shame. The only saving grace seems to be Sony who still believes that making good games is important, and I don\u2019t even use a Sony console.",

Having a game based around the idea that you'll never be able to get all of its content unless you spend 20x more than what it would have gotten if it was being sold for full price is just inherently unappealing. It is better for player numbers to grow, but is it really a net positive? \n\nGames like Destiny 2 are absolutely insane to try and play right now because there is just so much that has happened that is now no longer accessible. You can't go back and play old DLC, even if you've payed for it. That straight up just wouldn't happen at all if the original price included all of its content. \n\nI know the way the game is designed calls for constantly pushing new content out the door for people to play. But now developers don't even feel an obligation to give people a chance to do/play older stuff since FOMO is a very real player retention strategy. \n\nIt's a fairly recent trend and I can only foresee it getting worse. Thankfully the singleplayer genre is still booming. So I don't think GAAS will fully take over everything. \n\nBut it will definitely stick around and dip it's toe into a lot of franchises that simply don't even fit the bill for it.",

Fortnite, Apex, Valorant, League, and many others are examples where it's handled well. \n\nMy point is that *because* it's so successful, other companies try to emulate it. But they fail and release games that are half-assed or have massive issues while still asking players for *more* than $60. Which can plague game series that didn't have it before or create new game series that become a waste of time and money. And because they do it wrong, they lose players and shut down their servers because of lack of player retention and profit.  \n\nAnd I used Redfall as an example since it, at one point in development, was a GaaS title. So I think it's fair to bring it up since the end result was a disaster.  \n\nI'm just saying that GaaS *can* and *has* instilled bad habits into the games industry. Not that it's inherently bad or hasn't been done well. It's clear that it CAN be done very well. \n\nI just think some of the development strategies are just predatory and anti-consumer.  FOMO, Microtransactions, losing access to old content, etc.\n\nIt's up to each player whether that's something they can deal with, I suppose.",

So criticising f2p games for causing that seems a bit misguided.\n\nAnd besides, the consumers made their stance pretty clear about these games, just look at the halo infinite player count or the reception to gotham knights before even releasing. You still need something fun to actually be able to get stuff, especially cosmetics, appealing. Or if a more recent example, OW2, even when you have a fun game, you still need to do it properly. Just look at the twitch viewership numbers for that on release vs now.",

Who are you to say I\u2019m not allowed to have that option, just to satisfy your personal taste?

That\u2019s interesting because I\u2019m looking at the games coming out with their new accessibility features and they don\u2019t seem to be selling much differently. Case in point a title like Street Fighter 6 went all in on accessibility. It\u2019s recently hit a million sales. Good for it. It\u2019s predecessor Street Fighter 5 hit similar numbers with less money going on accessibility, less on graphics and probably less on marketing considering it started as an exclusive on fewer platforms. Capcom was able to ride that to around 7 million units sold across around 7 years despite the supposed lack of accessibility. Why are those numbers so similar if there\u2019s this secret horde of gamers that are supposedly chomping at the bit to play these big franchises in gaming as soon as they become easy enough? You have a remake of Final Fantasy 7 with all the modern graphics and accessibility options. All the extra money being poured into the marketing and it still did significantly less across all the platforms it was released on than the PS1 release of the original alone did. Then you have titles like Zelda Breath of the wild that became absurdly popular compared to previous entries despite being significantly more complicated than those past entries. That\u2019s just off the top of my head. \n\nI\u2019m not going to deny that game companies will desperately try and suck every last penny possible out of the public no matter how successful their titles become. That doesn\u2019t mean we gamers should be sitting here licking their boots over it as if they\u2019re gods or something. It\u2019s just greed. It\u2019s also unnecessary given how many franchises put out great game after great game by recycling the same graphics, character models and game engines. In a lot of cases it\u2019s what forced them to get creative with plots and gameplay rather than just treating their audience more and more like idiots every time and hoping the latest barely noticeable graphics boost would be enough to impress them. \n\nThank you for the reply btw. It\u2019s a lot better getting an actual response to debate than the usual lazy downvotes from people who treat game companies as deities.",

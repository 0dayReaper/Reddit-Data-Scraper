I'd love to have started all the way at the beginning, but I obviously missed that boat by a few years :p\n\n&gt;Also I thought B.net had all the game on their client.\n\nUnless it's hidden away somewhere, it looks like only Reforged is up on the client/store. That said, I just noticed that my account lists a copy of the original version of 3 and its expansion. That means I can still play that version, correct? No need to buy Reforged?\n\nIf so I'll just pick up the 1&amp;2 bundle on GoG and then I'm set.",

            "comment": "Did some achievement hunting in Fallout: New Vegas. I've played through this game numerous times, but never touched Caravan or really any of the casino stuff because... I don't really care about card games, I guess? Playing Caravan is probably the best representation of playing a boardgame where everyone involved keeps forgetting the rules. For example, I never quite understood what triggered the win or loss despite trying to read and understand the rules. Sometimes I'll win after getting two 26, other times I could get all three to 26 and the game would just continue. Sometimes all of my numbers would be higher and I'd lose. I got both achievements, though, so I'm good. I was dreading the achievement for getting banned from the Strip casinos because reasons, but if you have 10 points in luck and playing black jack it's practically impossible to lose. To begin with I tried to figure out what would be my best move given the cards I had. Like, should I get another card or should I stay as I'm at, like, 18 and chance would that I get a 4 or higher or whatever. Didn't take me long before I realised that with 10 luck all you have to do is just to double down on everything. You got two picture cards? double down, you'll get an ace. You got a total of ten? double down, you'll get an ace. 11? You'll get a ten or a picture card. Eight times out of ten times you'd win. Oh, as with Caravan, this also seemed to have some behaviours I never really got. Sure, you get an ace and a lady, just auto your turn because there is no reason to do anything, but plenty of times I would get my cards, they'd total 14, and it just end my turn. Never understood why.\n\nAnyway. I wish they would remaster New Vegas. Would be lovely to have a stable version of it. I don't want a remake because the game is generally fine as is, I just want all of the bugs fixed without needing to install a bunch of mods and fan patches.",

D4 is a slower paced game, which is fine, there's just a massive of amount of downtime in the game now.  A lot of the endgame revolves around running around in this vast open world to run a dungeon, do events or get to a target destnation.  For a game about killing hordes of demons, there is a lot mundane nothingness in between.",

I put about 15-20 hours into it again and was about to shelve it again before I decided to mod some QoL changes into it. Most specifically unlimited sprinting and I added portcrystals (teleportation). Those two simple changes have now seen me putting over 100 hours into the game. And I plan on getting the platinum for it. \n\nThe combat is quite satisfying. And the dungeon delving can be fantastic at times. It feels like playing D&amp;D in ways no D&amp;D game has ever felt. And there have been some amazingly epic encounters, like the Griffin's Bane quest in Bluemoon Tower. \n\nI'm into the DLC area now, which has been superb. Much better than the post-game area of the base game. It is pretty much all dungeon delving, but it is dungeon delving done superbly. And a real treat to enjoy.\n\nI've really come to appreciate so much about it now that I wasn't constantly annoyed by things. It's a really good game even if it has questionable execution in some ways. I'm so glad I decided to give it another go.  \n\n\nNow I am simply sad that I got into it when DD2 is still so far out.",

It\u2019s still filled with micro transactions (even worse than usual), the story is really really stupid, and the city is laggy and tedious to navigate\n\n**However**, 2K23 also features the WNBA (2K22 might have too) with its own mycareer mode called The W\u2026 \n\nIt. Is. So. Much. Better\n\nNo micro transactions (no vc at all in fact), no tedious grind, and a satisfying/refreshing take on progression. MyCareer has historically always had multiple goals, the main goal of making your player the best and the second usually being increasing your player\u2019s popularity to get sneaker deals and stuff like that. The W has those but also has another goal of straight up increasing the league\u2019s popularity by letting you make decisions between games (do charity work, media appearances, workout with other players, etc.) and increasing this gets the players (and you) paid more, gets more nationally televised games, and gets the league expanded once you max this out. It\u2019s great.\n\nWhy tf can\u2019t the nba mycareer be like this? Why can\u2019t there be an offline version of mycareeer that plays like this at least? How do you have a great career mode and an absolute garbage career mode in the same fucking game?",

But I can say that despite WWE television and their fans tearing their women on more or less equals, people have consistently cared more about the men's stuff than the women's in the video games.\n\nIn 2K22's steam achievements, the least obtained achievement in the Men's MyRise (their version of MyCareer) still had more people obtain it than most obtained one in the women's career. And in 2K23, everyone was obsessing over the men's story, even though IMO I liked the women's story way much more.\n\nSo in my unprofessional opinion, it seems like the WNBA career is experimental due to being the less popular career and thus, the devs thought that they needed it to be more assessable and have that extra hook in order to entice people to play it over the NBA which can play it safe and monetize-friendly.",

For as much fun as im having exploring, the games combat is just awful, and the controls almost ruin the experience for me.  The movements always made me queezy, but I think I finally nailed down what it is about it that just doesnt work.  It's that *diagonal movement inputs are always read as up or down*.  This makes maneuvering around enemies a pain, and it feels like this games difficulty is more about finding enough hearts to tank damage/ find arrows and items rather than learning enemy patterns or whatever.  LTTP fixed this with diagonal movement obviously, but I feel like even just biasing vertical/horizontal based on which one was last inputed.  It feels so bad to be moving sideways only to veer straight into a parallel enemy because I minutely rocked my finger.  I'm really trying to not use the rewind feature to get the \"intended experience\" but this controls decision is really getting at me and makes me feel like the game is flawed in an irredeemable way which sucks because there is so much interesting stuff being done elsewhere in the game.  Like stumbling upon the mastersword before getting to the first dungeon was awesome, but it feels like it doesnt respect the player in a lot of ways.",

I only hit 126 shrines and maybe 1/3rd of the Depths, but I could feel open world burnout creeping in and wanted to see the ending while I still liked the game. For the first half of the game I was thinking \"this is *way* better than Breath of the Wild\", but now I'm thinking it's more like two steps forward, one step back.\n\nThe new powers and vehicle stuff are great, though it would be nice if there was a way to set up some parts to be manually triggered rather than always firing at full blast, and it would also be really nice if &gt;!Autobuild could fetch Zonai capsules from your inventory rather than burning Zonaite if you don't manually drop them. Kinda defeats half the point of Autobuild!&lt;. In general, the UI is functional but has so much room for obvious improvements to things like the way you Fuse and &gt;!activate sage powers!&lt;.\n\nThe feedback the team heard from BOTW players about dungeons was \"we don't like that they all look the same, and give us dungeon items\", and they did a good job with the aesthetics at least, but the &gt;!sage powers are boring because the only thing you use them to do in dungeons is flip switches and poke the boss's weakness, and the only one you use outside of dungeons is Tulin's wind gust because it's the only one that isn't a massive pain in the ass to activate!&lt;.\n\nI was initially blown away by the scope of the Depths, but for the most part there didn't seem to be much of interest down there. &gt;!A sprinkling of Yiga bases, Zonai mines (that are also Yiga bases), boss re-fights, and that one coliseum under Eventide, which I'm sure is copy pasted several times!&lt; The main use of it seems to be as &gt;!a better shrine finder, since there is a 1:1 correspondence between lightroots and surface shrines, and lightroots are very easy to find!&lt;. I'll probably make heavy use of that when I pick the game back up if it gets DLC.\n\nThe main story was mostly an improvement over BOTW. The twist is really good, even if &gt;!it gets reversed at the end by Deus Ex Zonai in a really unsatisfying way. I always new Zelda would get de-dragonized, but I was hoping for it to happen by some chicanery with Mineru's power rather than just the power of love and friendship!&lt;. The final boss isn't as fun as Calamity Gannon was, but the victory lap phase is A+ and ends the game on a real high note.\n\nFinally, a question: Are there any really good side quests that I should make sure not to miss out on? I'm thinking along the lines of Eventide Isle and Tarrey Town in BOTW.",

My favorite part of Breath of the Wild was exploration, which I feel like I'm kind of robbed of, since the map is mostly the same as in the last game. There's some interesting changes, yes, but also some changes that make the game less enjoyable to play.\n\nFor instance, having a sand storm in the desert area is an interesting change, but really doesn't add anything to the game in terms of exploration. Just more to juggle and worry about in terms of keeping Link warm and knowing which direction you're going. Same with the snowstorm around Rito Village. What exactly is added here except some shallow survival mechanics making things more difficult?\n\nAnd when not exploring, I feel like the game is wasting my time. I'm just about at the Wind Temple, and it has just been a chore getting there. Using the hang glider for what seems like about an hour to go from platform to platform, and then using the flying ship things to get up above the storm is not really engaging, not that challenging (if you're protected from the cold), and really not that fun. Not to mention, there's only two shrines on the way to the temple, so if you decide you want to go back exploring, you have to do a lot of that section again.\n\nAnyway, that's just my experience as someone playing casually who hasn't put 100+ hours into the game and wasn't overloaded with hype beforehand. To be honest, it makes me want to go back and play Elden Ring again, which seemed like a game with more focus and less time wasting.",

If you'd play them on PC or console, then I imagine you'd have to ask how much the portability is worth to you. If you'd be looking at replacing the Switch with a Steam Deck, then I guess you'd look at price, ergonomics, and simplicity.  \n  \nPersonally, I find that I use my Switch primarily for 1st party games and don't play undocked terribly often. So I wouldn't get a ton of use out of it if I didn't like 1st party games.",

I'm also waiting for a bunch of patches, always annoying when I care more about a game than the fucking developer. I've been un-wishlisting and blacklisting more than wishlisting and buying, which again is something, no point in bothering with lazy or incompetent games/people if possible.",

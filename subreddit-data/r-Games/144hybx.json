It was a great game but the tonal shift was definitely radical and made me go WTF more than once. \n\nThough the reboot that came later in 2008 was quite unique and delved Persian mythology, which I don't remember ever seeing in any other game. I wish they continued with that universe.",

And I'll 100% agree with you on PoP 2008.\n\nThe only thing that sucked about it was the real ending being DLC locked. But the story and atmosphere was really neat, platforming was buttery smooth, combat was fun if a little on the easy side - and that's ignoring the whole... inability to die thing. Which wasn't really that big a deal, it was basically the same system as like a Zelda game where falling into a pit or lava is a slap on the wrist and a reset to where you were before lava-diving. If you \"died\" in a fight, basically everything's health reset almost all the way, dying during platforming was just a checkpoint reset without a game over screen.\n\n...That and naming the donkey Farah, that was just insulting to our poor girl after her hard turn in Two Thrones. Also Two Thrones is excellent, its biggest flaw I think is that it doesn't have the dreamlike, fairy tale atmosphere and aesthetic of Sands. The enemies and soundtrack were still far too heavily in the Warrior Within direction.\n\nStill, the daggertail whip is a pretty cool weapon and still remains fairly unique even so long after it was released.",

In terms of game mechanics, failure had the same exact effect as death in traditional games. Your progress and changes to health (yours and the opponent's) were all reset to the last checkpoint, but it was styled out narratively.\n\nIt was **such** a refreshing deconstruction of what we expect from our video games.",

It's all awesome. I had the soundtrack of the game and basically they had all the songs from all of the games. I wore that mofo out.",

The Prince at the start of WW is a really broken man trying to escape the literal manifestation of fate itself.",

Half of the chases have an original song called \"escape the dahaka\".\n\nThere are only 2 godsmack songs in the game and one of them plays during the credits and the other plays for a total of 5-6 times.\n\nThe rest of the soundtrack is awesome. I find the edgy direction they went with a bit extreme (especially character models) but there are lots of oriental/middle-eastern influences in the music. They are just played on a distorted guitar etc.",

PoP has already been about, well, a Persian prince which is far from the typical white American protagonist. Persia (and now Iran) itself has always been a very diverse kingdom too and for example a majority of Iranians in the south are black. But this character looks nothing like a black Iranian/Persian. He is just an black America in Persian clothing. As you said \"incredibly hip-hopification/Americanisation of the premise\".\n\nEither way, I am very excited for the game nonetheless because the gameplay looked really good.",

Hence, *The Immortals* - because the names stayed the same.\n\n\nMind you, I learned that in school some 15 years ago so my memory might be wrong on the numbers, but the gist should be correct.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortals_(Achaemenid_Empire)",

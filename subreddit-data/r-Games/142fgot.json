Even compared to their own Pro laptops which starts at $2000. You can buy a Pro Apple laptop \\*and\\* an iphone pro 14 phone as well and still have money left over to buy an Xbox Series X or a PS5. And that's just compared to the starting price of this thing.\n\nThe only angle from which this isn't expensive is a B2B device, but that clearly isn't what they're advertising this as considering they're selling it as some lifestyle shit.\n\nI don't get why people defend this shit when it's Apple. People weren't this charitable with neither Sony nor Meta's latest VR headsets and both of those were priced significantly less than this thing.",

That's how they create the massive profit margins that have made them the top global company.\n\nBut setting that aside - it's not a terrible thing. There is a need for the technology to be pushed to the next level for it to really start to fulfill its potential - but at the sub $1000 range, it'll take 10+ years to achieve that goal. At $3500, Apple has essentially brought us to that door step... at least as far as the HMD itself goes.\n\nWith headset prices competing in this range, we will get a greater diversity of potential solutions, and an acceleration of the critical software OS side - the current OSes are Palm OS level stuff. Janky, primitive, insufficient, experimental.\n\nThe future XR OS's will need to let you do what you already do in a computing environment, but better and in XR.",

This is not a purely VR headset, and while it can game it is not it\u2019s sole purpose. Apple\u2019s promotional video on the matter basically made the point that this is an AR computer first and foremost, the VR is there and controller-less, but it\u2019s not the main point. This device is capable of excellent VR, but it\u2019s true purpose is as an AR computer -  no other device is currently doing what apple is promising here. It\u2019s a computer/ecosystem you strap to your face - Computing without the standards of computing we\u2019ve used since the 80\u2019s. \n\nThe price is high because unfortunately it needs to be - not everyone needs this computer yet. That\u2019s what this price is doing, making it so that people who truly want one fork over the cash (ironically tamping down on buyers remorse as well due to the principle of high price gain) and test a working fully-functional product in real-time so they can see where the average user will want to see improvements on the next iteration, what types of programs and features they\u2019ll want as well as how to tweak and make the UX better overall - because again , no one else has done this personal AR system yet and VR has only been niche as hell because it\u2019s only been for gaming enthusiasts with expendable cash. By keeping this first gen out of the reach of anyone except diehards and developers, this allows it to be a way more friendly developer experience to allow developers and apple to fine-tune their products and help developers with the experience should they require it. The price is also high because not every dumbass with a social media account will be able to spout off how \u201cthere\u2019s nothing here at launch\u201d because Apple is already aware of this - this exact scenario happened in the first generation iPhone until the App Store came along - remember kids, the App Store didn\u2019t exist until a software revision MUCH later and it coincided with the release of the iPhone 3G.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking that this is comparable to other VR headsets on the market, you\u2019re looking at it too narrowly and only from the eyes of entertainment. This device is possibly going to be as groundbreaking as the iPhone, and because it is a new space to develop for in tech there is a potential gold rush to develop for it so that by the next iteration those developers have a foothold in the new ecosystem and are also able to troubleshoot more efficiently. That\u2019s why this is big, Apple has potentially created a new ecosystem just like they did with the smartphone. This is going to be wild to witness in real time.\n\nI watched the presentation, saw the price and recoiled at first, but as I kept thinking about it all I could think of were really cool apps and programs that could help people in the workplace, at home, for safety, entertainment, education, and so on. Not once did I think of gaming for it, even though that\u2019s probably coming because controller-less VR is the next step after keeping the other systems untethered. I might be one of the dumbasses who end up spending on one because I really want to develop for it. There\u2019s a lot of potential for something like this, especially when the competitor AR headsets begin showing up just like when Android came AFTER the iPhone.",

One of the iPhones earliest hits was a port of Monkey Ball DS. There were also numerous PC games were playable entirely with a mouse with designs could be relatively easily adapted to a touch screen interface.\n\nThe combination of the touch screen with haptics also meant you could at least give some feedback when a user \"presses\" a virtual button.\n\nThere were examples of how a touch screen focused system could do games well. On the other hand, the predecessors we've got for the Vision Pro are a bunch of gimmicky devices that didn't go anywhere. No one remembers the Kinect fondly.",

It changed everything in that sense. And comparing some stylus touch speaks out of depth to me.\n\nYour argument seems to be \"it was never done before\". Which is one of the lowest forms of argumentation you can come up with.\n\n\"Compatibility will be non-existent\". Because pulling up a virtual keyboard or gamepad doesn't make it compatible? Says who? Is it because we are touching thin air and not a touchscreen? You can pull up your virtual controllers on the table or on a book on your lap. Or you can touch air and get used to it, like we got used to iPhones.",

You can keep insisting that up until 2007 no one had ever made a game that involves pointing at something on a screen but that is fundamentally not true.\n\nWe had games entirely focused around touch screens such as Warioware Touched and games focused entirely around motion controls like Warioware Twisted, and entire genres of PC games based around pointing and clicking things.

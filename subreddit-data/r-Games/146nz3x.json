    "postText": "`Combine And Conquer` is a multi-planetary automation game.  \nThere's no player model as in other automation games and no manual crafting. One is forced to truly automate everything.  \nIt has a unique module system where one can create custom building blocks by simulating smaller factories.  \nThe game starts very simple and small on a single planet with very few technologies unlocked.  \nThe player can then research / unlock more advanced building blocks and use the module system to create and combine custom 'assemblers' to craft the more complicated, late game recipes.  \nAt the late stage of the game it's then possible to colonize new planets to extract titanium from there which is required for end-game recipes.  \nMost planets are implemented as some kind of challenge. E.g. a planet without any coal, a planet without any sun, planets with very short or long days (solar panels vs battery usage), planets with very little space, planets with very large but sparse resource fields.  \nIt's pretty well optimized and I continuously try to improve its performance (my machine can currently handle a factory of roughly 250k buildings with the released version, around 800k with my dev version)  \nIt's currently in EA and I plan to keep it that way for at least 2023.  \nIt's available for Linux and Windows.  \nThere's a demo that is feature-complete except for the ability to load savegames.  \n\nI'm very interested in feedback and ideas and have a subreddit and Discord server for that purpose. I also post frequent development updates there.  \nDiscord https://discord.gg/peBD6Z5PvN  \nSubreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/CombineAndConquer/  \n\nIt's available on  \nSteam https://store.steampowered.com/app/2220850/Combine_And_Conquer/  \nItch https://martinbucksoftware.itch.io/combine-and-conquer  \n\nI recently remade all graphical assets and created a 'development progress' video  \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1464dvn/the_25_year_development_progress_of_my_automation/  \n\n\n\nThere's also some let's plays (with the pre-remake graphics)    \nWally1169  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwACV1kVVGE&amp;list=PL9YKWZMX7BD-6gFZHNUdHQpQzff4BSyoY  \n  \nCallMeJeff  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PBwmi-4j84&amp;list=PLBm4Uaa1zGFsrfgwgE91oZfbcyBcIIN83&amp;index=5  \n\nFeel free to AMA and have fun with `Combine And Conquer` :)",

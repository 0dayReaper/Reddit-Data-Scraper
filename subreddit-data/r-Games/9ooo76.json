I am only allowed to work 2 hours of OT every month, so 40 hours is our norm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy supervisor has told me how much flak he and his boss get for keeping as hourly employees. If we were salaried, we'd have to answer emails when not in the office and also be able to jump on a call at any moment. This makes it hard to have nice interactions with other internal teams. People look down on us for only working 40 hours a week and joke that we're lazy. ",

Computer off, laptop and work phone left at work.  I get paid a very reasonable salary and I'm happy with that and not taking on more responsibility.  \n\nOddly enough, my wife and I just had this conversation last night.  I work as a regional account manager for a pretty large worldwide company, so if I ever want to step into a role with more responsibility or make money the opportunity is 100% there but at my age and place in life(30, father of a 2 year old) I just have zero desire to be at work more than I need to be.  I could easily step into a more prominent role that would pay me a lot more, but then I'd be expected to be available at all times and on the road almost every day of the week.  Sure, I'm not making 100k+ with what I'm doing, but it's perfect for our lifestyle and combined we both make more than enough to be comfortable and afford nice things.  \n\nI'm not out to be a slave to my employer.",

I stopped that shit after that project. About a year later I ended up taking a different job.\n\nIt was about 30% pay cut, and gave up a lot of company stocks that still pain me.

The job I was working previous to this was very corporate, demanded long hours, strict management, insane targets etc.  I was already trending out of being in that environment, because I just think that it was unhealthy for me mentally(as it is for most people).  There are way more things in life that are fulfilling than putting in more time at fuckin *work*.\n\nNow that I have a kid though it's way different.  I'd easily rather sacrifice something myself than to have to see him grow up without knowing me like I did with my Dad who worked himself to death.  \n\nMaybe it's a generational thing, idk, I always read that the millennial generation is trending towards being more \"what's best for the child\" focused than \"what's best for the family\" focused, but I just got sick of feeling unappreciated and taken advantage of by a company and I want to be at home with my family.  I work my job, do it well and go home.  I don't get paid to think about partner relationships at 7pm when I'm reading a book to my kid.",

One, those 100+ hour weeks are abhorrent, and employees need protection. But realistically, if we unionized, most studios would face layoffs in preparation for the change. Cynical, but I have no doubt that would happen. \n\nWorse yet is that labor in the industry is also dictated by the government, such as in certain places in Canada where it's legal for companies to not pay for overtime. \n\nPoor management has become so engrained in the industry, that I have a hard time seeing how it can be fixed. \n\nEdit: I also think it's worth pointing out that good studios do exist, and there are some places that end up requiring far little crunch.

People may lose their jobs, but the 100+ hour weeks should be illegal (and is, in Europe, unless you sign a waiver), and the practice has been going on for decades.

As a result, their strikes are very powerful, because studios can't easily break the union by making movies without star talent. In video games however, the \"star\" talent is in quality control and exists at the producer level - people that wouldn't be striking for a union anyway.\n- The Taft-Hawley Act was legislated in response to Hollywood union activity. Legislative regulation, while in this case drafted against the unions, exists to reach more permanent and reasonable solutions. \n- Hollywood used mobsters to harass, infiltrate, and manage or mangle the unions. \n- SAG averaged more than one strike per decade for the first 50 years of their existence, including in the early days walkouts only a few years apart.\n\nHollywood fought for decades, with all the leverage of wealthy star talent, to get where they were. Eventually, SAG put people into politics who shared their vision (for example a former SAG President named Ronald Reagan), and got enough of them elected to have real political lobbying sway in terms of labor legislation as well as FCC regulation.\n\nVideo games are entertainment, yes, but developers have none of the benefits that SAG had.",

Each team (in this case it sounds like studio) has a lead or two. Those leads are responsible for making sure their team works well and also have regular meetings with all the other leads and, less often, the overall project lead(s). The end result is that everyone is constantly focused on deliverables and goals and you have oversight from peers who are comfortable saying \"Hey, are you sure you'll finish that in time? Do you need some help?\" which tends to course correct early and avoid the situations that lead to \"crunch\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main keys are having sufficiently disjoint teams and ensuring that you have that almost peer-review style oversight.",

Anything 101 touches is a miserable, stagnant parking lot during commute hours.\n\nIronically the best thing about crunch time is driving home at 2am. Zero traffic. My workday during crunch time was from 10am to 2am. I got in late enough to avoid most of the traffic and there was zero traffic on the way back.\n\nCrunch time only lasted about 2 weeks though. Its a sprint, not a marathon. Reddit doesn't seem to understand that even crunch time isn't working constantly. Yes, you're in the office 100 hours a week for a couple of weeks, but there's a lot of downtime. I played video games, received free breakfast, lunch, and dinner, even took naps. You need to be available to do work on short notice but you're not actually doing work constantly. There's just no time to wait for the next day. You can't have people out of the office. Delays in communication add up fast and towards the end of the project there's no luxury of extra time to waste.\n\nIts not like working in a coal mine in the 1890's for 100 hours a week.",

So many last minute things that everyone overlooked and found purely by chance. Crunch time is fixing all of these issues. You can't push the release date. Release date is locked in months ago. Your marketing campaign is focused on this date. You also have contracts with other partners. Breaking all those contracts and flushing your marketing campaign down the drain is not an option.\n\nIts last minute polish and bugfixing. There will always be bugs found, including critical bugs you cannot launch with.\n\nAs an example, BF1942 had a bug where if you enabled friendly fire mirror damage and this mirror damage was enough to kill you, you'd crash the server. Not your game client, but the entire server. This bug was found about a week before launch. It never occurred to anyone to start a server, enable friendly fire, enable mirror damage, and crank up the mirror damage to the point where the friendly fire attacker would gib themselves due to mirror damage. No one had ever tried that before. Its a good thing someone finally did! Note that this was an actual, real bug. it was a showstopper. We could not launch a game with a bug that caused servers to crash. It had to be fixed.\n\nThis bug was fixed within a day. It was reported in the morning and 3 builds later it was confirmed fixed. I think this one was reported around 11am and confirmed fixed at around 1am the following night. Thats why you have everyone in the office during this critical time. You get stuff done fast. Everyone on the team is already there. There's no delay in pushing new builds and getting immediate feedback from QA or the localization guys. You might have to go wake them up because they were taking a nap, but they were in the office. You got an answer right away.\n\nVideo games have so many moving parts and so many things that can interact in entirely unexpected ways you're guaranteed to find something. Sometimes you find something really bad. Thats the unknown unknowns. These problems are so weird and unexpected you can't plan for them.",

I work in software development too, but not video games, and we seldom have exactly set dates for release... for patches. And since our products are aimed at professionals and we don't release entirely new programs very often, it's seldom an issue. \n\nBut of course things are different for video games where there's marketing and you can't really talk with all your customers directly. (We can talk with our biggest customer corporations and tell them if something needs a delay and they'll usually understand.) I'm not sure how this can be solved. I mean, you could always just not have a set release date, but that will probably cut into marketing somehow.\n\nAnyway, this makes crunch sound a bit more bearable/understandable.

Everything about packaging and shipping needs a firm date. You can't just show up to a factory that stamps discs with a build and ask them to get to work, you have to schedule that in advance so they can fit it in with all the other games that need their discs stamped. Drivers need to be scheduled to move the discs from the factory to warehouses around the world. Gamestop and Best Buy need to know when they will need the shelf space. Etc.",

The biggest accomplishment of right-wing governments has been dismantling of or vilifying of organized labour. \n\nCan unions be overreaching or unreasonable in some cases? Yes. But, generally companies do not have employees interests at heart. Take a company like Amazon; they *need* people to deliver their products, package, sort, label, etc. And yet, they're able to pay them terribly and overwork despite massive profits, and essentially subsidize themselves by dumping employed people on the government's dime since often they aren't paid a living wage and still have to seek financial aid. Same reason for good minimum wage (and before anyone says \"Well, companies will automate!\"; they're doing it already regardless of how cheap or expensive minimum wage is). ",

Basically, the question of supporting unions is, what do you value more, workers or business? Only it's a trick question, because business can't exist without workers. We seem to have forgotten that in this country. ",

Those that try to unionize will be fired or laid-off, and then blacklisted.  Companies know they have workers by the dangling unmentionables, and if they let them go, there is a HUGE population waiting to do whatever they can to get their foot in the door.  It would take a huge company (read: EA, Ubi, or Activision/Blizzard) unionizing for there to be any traction, and that simply won't happen.  Companies like their money.  Unionizing would cause that money to shrink as wages improved.\n\nI really want it to happen, because crunch blows, wages are bad, and lay-offs are too plentiful...but it isn't realistic.",

I'd heard how gamedev was and I didn't even consider it, I was given the option of working for the gamedev wing of a company I was interning in, I chose dull database development on a government contract.\n\nThe people who work in gamedev are the people who didn't quit when they were asked to work overtime. The people who work in gamedev are the people that came back after they were fired after the last project. The people who work in gamedevs are those willing to work for pay that's horrible for their degree.\n\nThese people aren't making a union if there was a union they're the people who would have subverted it.",

As it stands a sizeable chunk can't use their points fullstop because their activation emails get lost in the digital aether, which has been happening for at least a year and a half. And I'd wager only about 30-40% of the remainder of customers I talk to ever use their points, at least some of whom are because they just forgot they have them or they don't want to make others wait in line while they redeem their points (especially if they are trying to figure out how in real-time, which a lot of people don't).\n\nHere you're also adding on discounts that most people won't see used frequently because depending on the store most traffic is coming in for new games. The avid collector regulars and people who actually engage with the Preowned trade loop will see a lot of value but that's not most people.",

The company's moving back towards retro stuff- we've recently started taking trades for and actively stocking games for pretty much every system older than the 360/PS3/DS which is as old as we carried before, so maybe once there's been time for those stocks to replenish that 5% can get some more value, but a whole $10 extra is a lot in this economy for a purely luxury service. They also seem to want to start stocking retro consoles again in the foreseeable future as well.\n\nPro Weeks are also happening more, I think they said they plan to do them monthly (up from the current 4 times/year) but don't quote me on that. Points will be redeemable at the register now rather than you having to navigate the mobile app (which tons of people can't use cuz it fails to send confirmation emails to activate your account like 30% of the time). But of course the monkey's paw curls with the fact that Points will now expire a year after acquisition, and all Points get wiped after a yet-unannounced grace period if you don't renew your account (currently you have 6 months, it'll be much shorter now).\n\nIf it makes you feel better pretty much the entire employee base has been slamming them for this via the new social media-esque communication hub we use since we found out weeks ago. It's generally accepted that it has much more value if you engage with it, which is how corporate has been justifying it, but they're not the ones who have to try to convince people to spend $25 *right now* for a 5% discount that doesn't include new games and some points they can't use now and might never come back to use before they go away.",

Apparently all of your points will expire if you aren\u2019t a pro member effective June 27th and any points you accumulate (retroactively including the points you have) will expire in a year. Those terms are nothing short of insulting.",

We've accumulated hundreds of thousands of points. We went to Gamestop if we needed something to do or were bored. We really wanted to support the last physical gaming-focused store.\n\nWe plan on cashing them all out in a week and not renewing. What an *absolute* kick to the balls to any loyal customers they've had.",

That was the shit for years, especially the gaming parts, and it's basically non existent now because of how they've gutted the program. \n\nWe've already seen companies dramatically increase their prices, decrease their sales, decrease their pay etc so much since we were kids. Can't imagine what it'll be like in another 20 years.",

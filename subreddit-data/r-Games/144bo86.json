Any posts or comments about it on /r/DeadSpace gets no traction or replies of \"it ran fine for me\". \n\nThe remake is amazing and I have a good enough PC where the traversal stutter was ok for *most* of the game. But for the last 2-3 chapters the stutter really ramped up and it was almost unplayable. I do hope Motive releases a patch before I go for another playthrough.",

Game is an absolute masterpiece but it is held back by one little performance issue.\n\nFrom my experience however, the stuttering only happens on your **first** playthrough. I started a New Game+ and so far I am at Chapter 7 with zero stuttering. You should be fine with your second playthrough.",

Like I know the share video and ram system coupled with the gpu being able to be fed memory directly is a big change this time around. I don't think anything other than rewriting the whole game is going to fix this, which could meant no multiplatform games will ever run well on pc for the foreseeable future.",

I was surprised because I only have a 1060 (Nvidia w 6GB VRAM) but I ran it on high settings and was able to hover between 40-60fps (no noticeable stutter but I might be missing it? Is it really obvious?). I know there were lots of problems for people but I wonder if it's an Nvidia vs AMD thing.\n\nAlso I wonder if newer cards have more problems; sounds counter intuitive but maybe devs know how to deal with older cards since they've been around longer.",

Running an 6600 and R5 5600, and the game had ton of stutter, that is never getting fixed. DLSS and fsr texture quality is still fucked, even though you can manually fix it on Nvidia cards. Game is super taxing too, specially in the latest versions. Great game tho. \n\nThat why I haven't bought Jedi Survivor yet. That one seems way worse and it's been dry on updates. Maybe I'll get 1 month of Pro to test in the future.",

I'm generally not buying games on release, especially when their ports aren't good, and unless someone like DF will re-test them, change of getting misinformed is quite hard. I'm mentioning this because the information I got about Dead Space was that stutter problems are almost completely fixed and are technically not an issue, this video proves otherwise.\n\nIt's interesting that Forspoken got streaming speed settings hidden in texture settings. It's 2nd game that I'm aware of, that allows for customizing streaming speed, and I really wish we had more games with that setting.\n\nBy the way, it's great to hear (another?) explanation how DLSS3 impacts CPU-related stutter in indirect way. It seems that most popular opinions are that DLSS3 clears stutters and that DLSS3 does nothing to help with stutter, and both aren't true, and truth is more complicated than that.",

If you have the mind set of \"They should have released it fixed at first so they don't deserve my money\" then you're not rewarding effort and the expenditure required to improve the product. And if that's the case then there's no reason to *ever* work on a product post-launch since it won't matter.\n\nThat is if the game interests you in the first place. Look at how far No Man Sky came through the extra effort. If they weren't rewarded for their effort, then they should logically have left the game in its initial state.",

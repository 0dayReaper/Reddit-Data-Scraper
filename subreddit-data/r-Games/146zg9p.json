Compare it to [*Avowed*'s cinematic announcement trailer, and it presents itself in a more darker atmosphere with the way lights and shadows gets played.](https://youtu.be/W3QkO8fy3tg), which I think aligned to the general [atmosphere of the first *Pillars of Eternity*-game](https://nomadicgamer.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-03-30-22-02-48.png), whereas this recent trailer with gameplay seems to aim for the more [colourful and exotic ambience of *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*](https://assetsio.reedpopcdn.com/pillars_of_eternity_ii_screenshot_2018.05.08___12.10.03.21.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp), but I feel like *Avowed* seems to have notched even a bit above the saturation level for PoE:II, which had an update to its lightning and shadows-engine to quite good efficiency as party member Xoti's lantern can attest.\n\nEssentially, if someone told me that *Avowed* was a sequel to [*Dragon Age: Inquisition*](https://youtu.be/8DHLjiHqfHM) based on its colour-saturation, yeah, I could see myself believing in it. I'm not saying that *Avowed* can't have a more brighter and colourful look for its own benifit, but the tone of *Avowed*'s announcement trailer made me thought that the ambience would be leaning in the more semi-realistic look instead of gaining the cartoony vibes from it, like how *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* has a more muted colour compared to *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*'s often over-saturated look.",

And it told us what part of Eora the game is in, admittedly.\n\nIf this game is just combat, then it's not fitting with Obsidian's brand. Which is fine, but the combat doesn't look that good even after years of development, and if that's *all the game has to show for itself* then that's not a good sign.",

Grounded, Sea of Thieves, Psychonauts, etc., are all high-quality games that are criminally under appreciated, but beyond Starfield, I'm not sure what Xbox Studio game is gonna feel AAA.\n\nDeveloping a system where a plethora of xbox studios deliver games to gamepass on a consistent basis is definitely difficult. With game production taking so long nowadays, the lull of exclusives these last few years is understandable while we wait for all the studios to adjust.\n\nBut Microsoft's project only works if their studios can produce quality AAA games, given enough time. So far we have seen nothing to suggest they can. They can produce quality niche and AA games, games that I enjoy thoroughly, but what's the next Starfield?",

I've loved everything by Obsidian so far, it's my favourite studio, and I have more faith in the devs at Obsidian to write a good story than Emil Pagliarulo at Bethesda (although I think Josh Sawyer is taking on more of a consulting role on this, which makes me sad). Unfortunately, showing off dialogue trees doesn't make for a good trailer, so this is what we got. Obsidian aren't known for the best combat systems in the industry, but it looks pretty similar to what we had in Skyrim, and that combat was satisfying if not revolutionary. Obsidian is still very much a double A studio. They don't have Bethesda resources to include and perfect every combat/crafting/vehicle/companion/faction/base-building/physics/animation/etc system under the sun, along with a galaxy-sixed map to explore.\n\nOverall, I think this will be a nice AA diversion for Elder Scrolls fans waiting for the next ES installment. Hopefully they still lean into Eora's pantheon, which is one of the best I've seen in videogames.",

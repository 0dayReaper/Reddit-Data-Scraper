Maybe in a future trailer we can see some more info on what your goal or purpose is because building your own Yaga chicken hut is fucking cool but I can\u2019t see that being, like, the point. Trailer has a lot of the child walking about at a brisk pace over tracks of mostly nothing. \n\n\nAt least the tone and art looks really well put together so far so that\u2019s neat.",

The IGN Japan player has evolved to be extremely good at the game so I recommend watching the S-Rank fight in the second half of the video. The player was able to hold their own despite being 15 levels below the mob. He dies at the end in a nail-biting ending.",

Each player gets a number (1-8) above their head that indicates when an attack is going to hit them and its sometimes combined with other mechanics so players have to do things according to what number they get. \n\nIts somewhat infamous because you have to remember what each number has to do, so there is a good amount of individual responsibility, and people are generally bad at counting, so it often becomes a wall for progression through a raid.",

Then, it disappears--Enemy still casting. Then enemy does animation for the attack, and if you were in the circle when it disappeared, *now* you take damage.\n\nThat delay is *terrible* for readability during fights. I believe it's like that due to old spaghetti code and networking issues. But it suuucks.",

Really cool to see something like that instead of the button mashing clips that have been on the trailers.  That S rank gameplay was really impressive too.  I do think everything has about 30% too much health from what I've seen..\n\nUnfortunately this really doesn't look like a game I'd enjoy playing. Kinda bummed about that, but I'll be excited to watch a Let's Play at some point because it does look incredibly well made!",

The boss' mechanics for an S-Rank is so easy to even see yet the player seems to play way too defensive. \n\nAnd yet all the complaints you can see are how spongy HUNT MARK, which is considered supposed to be a boss monster is.\n\nThis kind of comments are too whack now. Didn't people cry the same before FFVIIR was released?\n\nEdit:\n\nWatching it again and I'm more confused about the complaints. For a S Rank Boss it had little health. It almost died that easily against an **underleveled** character who was controlled by a player who \"kinda\" knew what they were doing.",

Is there a difficulty setting with low health for everyone or can you only get that on an easy mode with an invincible MC? Is it just a level disparity on these videos?",

Notice the minor wolves in the first fight, and how they fall after a couple of combos? That's the standard for weak or low-class enemies. When facing Hunt mobs (sidequests designed to have you fight more difficult monsters) or unique/difficult fights or bosses, that's where you're likely to see higher HP so that the enemy mechanics can actually do some harm and so that the stagger mechanic can be utilized.\n\nThere is also a level disparity on the latter half of this video (note Clive is level 30 but the hunt is level 45), contributing to its tankiness.",

What I meant was that, since the mobs have more HP, that allows the trailers and gameplay demonstrations to string together the individual moves in multiple ways, demonstrating the flexibility of the systems and moves.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the only \"combo\" specific abilities are things like the immediate follow-ups after a dodge, parry, knockdown, or pull, all of which would apply to a single enemy and only persist for a single attack, after which you're just using the abilities that you've assigned. Perhaps there are abilities that go beyond that and do require a specific sequence of individual moves, but I haven't seen one or heard of one yet.",

As FFXIV was getting bigger and bigger he also constantly introduced and reworked systems from early game and is constantly working on systemic overhauls that lots of MMOs literally never get. \n\nThe continuous success and the story of how it happened being so public (there's 10 more things that any FFXIV player can tell you about how Yoshi P goes about doing things, like him constantly being a high level raider and playing his games a lot to make sure everything is tuned correctly etc) make people much more confident in Yoshi P's next game being a hit over someone random who has made an amazing game in the past but we know nothing about how.",

They had slight changes to a few combat or leveling mechanics but it was largely the same. Final Fantasies 1-9 especially all played almost identically with very minor changes. This game is basically in an entirely new genre. I think saying it's like XCom becoming an FPS is a perfect example - XCom always had guns and you shooting stuff, it's just a change of how you interact with the combat system surely.",

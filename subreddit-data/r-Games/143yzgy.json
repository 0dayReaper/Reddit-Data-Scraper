            "comment": "Looks like a really great Zelda style dungeon maker. They even nailed the music. It also looks like it's finally a Zelda like that gets the combat mechanics right. It blows my mind how few games like this get the combat right.\n\nHowever, I don't see anything about items or an overworld to connect everything together. It'll get too stale without items to keep things interesting and doing the dungeons will feel empty without the purpose of a world and story to drive you through them.",

Craft legendary journeys from scratch with an intuitive level creator to make simple dungeons, **entire overworlds**, and everything in between in this faithful pixel art love letter to top-down action JRPG classics of yesteryear. Drag-and-drop dozens of themed design tiles onto a blank canvas to create lava-filled caverns, mountainous overworlds, grassy forests, desert dunes, and more. Provide instructions for the quest ahead or design an epic narrative full of placeable NPCs and customizable signs with a plethora of dialogue options.\n\nSounds like you'll be able to have an overworld and I saw a chest being opened with an item in it and other items shown later in the trailer so I'd assume it would have some stuff to choose from.",

For me one of the most frustrating experiences of dungeons is trying forever, finally giving up and googling it, and then having the answer be so obscure and unfair feeling that I should have just googled it to begin with. \n\nI imagine a lot of the dungeons will feel that way with some gems in the mix",

Even with Unity and Unreal, if you're making good money with games built on those engines, you owe royalties.\n\nThere's also the issue of expectations. People know going into this that they'll need to build their own levels or get them from others. It's not a bait and switch or anything.\n\nIf you show you can produce good levels, you might even be able to commission levels out. That's what's happened with customs in rhythm games. I wouldn't be surprised if MM had something similar.",

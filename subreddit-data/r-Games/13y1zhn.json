When player input is used directly without fudging anything you ends up with too many cases where the optimal animations can't be used and things end up getting jerky and weird, and with geometry as varied as Spiderman's you're going to end up with a lot of those cases. So instead the game in constantly choosing best options for attachment points and swings and mapping your input to those options, and putting in automatic inputs when necessary to keep things smooth. 95% of the time you'll never notice in, which is better than 25% of the time you're going to get imperfect swinging animations and feel.",

Will they do an Assassin's Creed style soft-boundary with some more buildings/terrain continuing into the distance, but you just can't continue in that direction? \n\nI hope they figured out how to do it without it feeling and looking awkward.",

    "postText": "Hello, r/Games!\n\nWe are a couple working on Slaves of Magic, a fantasy isometric 2D turn-based Xcom-like strategy game. The basic premise is that invaders came to the continent where the humans live from another dimension and they brought magic with them. The player will have to build up and lead the resistance forces against these invaders while trying to learn more about their magic.\n\nThose familiar with the Xcom games will find the premise and the core game loop familiar. The game has 2 layers, a tactical layer where you control your team of 6-8 person on a mission, and a campaign layer where you will manage the resistance assets, troops, research new equipment, etc.\n\nThe way we want to stand out from the crowd (besides the fantasy setting) is our commitment to replayability in all aspects of the game. For example, we will have multiple types of invading forces with different units to fight on the battlefield, and a different AI for their behavior in the campaign layer as well. It manages its own resources, opinion on the resistance threat, and goals that it tries to archive by its armies on the campaign layer. We want to make every run a unique challenge to solve. Admittedly this higher focus on replayability does mean scripted storytelling takes a back seat beside some environmental storytelling and text entries.\n\nIf you find the idea intriguing you can discover more about the game in these places:\n\n\\- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1442610/Slaves_of_Magic/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=games) (with devlogs plus a demo including the first 3 in-game months)  \n\\- [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ip4rcR2Zb3w)  \n\\- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SlavesOfMagic)  \n\\- [Discord](https://discord.gg/aMpw9WY7mp)\n\nWe plan to release it at the end of the year for PC (and Linux if there is enough interest for it). If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them to the best of my ability!",

Depending on the game state this could lock out players from using specific skills or equipment on that run.",

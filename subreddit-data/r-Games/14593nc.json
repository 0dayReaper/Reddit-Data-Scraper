            "comment": "I've always felt like the Assassin's Creed franchise  was such a missed opportunity in regards to it orginal vision. I've enjoyed some of the games over the years, and even loved a few such as the Ezio trilogy. However the first game, while a little mechanically raw and incredibly repetitive, had an amazing premise: drop the player into a dense historical city, give them a target, and let them approach it however they like. The Ezio games were very good, but I miss the premise behind the original mission structure. Something closer to \"Hitman in medieval times with parkour and gadgets\" is such a compelling concept to me, and I was hoping hat Mirage would explore that again.",

There were some missions that had several different ways to get close to the target, and one mission (that I remember, there might have been more) explicitly showed the player several different ways to kill the target from the more traditional stabbing to poisoning the targets wine, then placing them in a well guarded open area making it difficult to just walk up to the target, which encouraged a creative approach to the problem.\n\nThere was a hint of promise in Unity that never got expanded upon.",

And as I was playing newer games, instead I was doing crappy combat and the worlds-worst-traveling-salesman-collector-simulator, traveling the map from icon to icon picking up widgets. At some point in the series I found myself quitting new games fairly quickly, because I don't want to do crappy swordplay, and now I've just stopped playing them entirely. \n\nAnd this whole \"lost charm\" of assassination as we look at the arc of the game series also contains, inexplicably, in the middle of all of that, a completely orthogonal genius idea of... uhm... an awesome pirate game.... that they also then promptly abandoned. \n\nI want an assassination game and (separately) black-flag2, not shitty witcher and/or even shittier dark souls.

I was about to give up on it after 3, but everyone called 4 amazing so I gave it one final shot.\n\nAll I got was better ship combat but that isn't why I played these games, I also found the ship combat lacking too much in depth overall and it lost it's appeal quite quickly to me. So I was like \"so that's it, that's all they can muster?\" I haven't played a single AC game since.\n\nAnd none of the games that came after looked like they actually improved on the core gameplay. Hell Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla even WEAKENED the core further by just giving it an appearance of depth by just locking combat effectiveness behind player level and gear and such.\n\nAll I ever wanted since AC1 was \"Historical Hitman\". I never got it, so I'm out. Hell I'd also have taken a \"Historical Metal Gear\" but didn't even get THAT since the stealth system was so underdeveloped and combat so OP. Gunplay in Metal Gear is INTENTIONALLY bad, so that stealth is usually the preferable option. It paid lip service to the idea of the stealthy assassin that hides in plain sight. The entire title of the franchise is a parody.",

Slow, story-driven period-pieces, where you play as someone with very limited combat tools but tons of ways to infiltrate and exfiltrate. Targeting fans of history, stories, and methodical planning, but NOT action.  \n\nBlack Flag. A swashbuckling pirate fantasy, where you get ships, crew, an veritable armory of pirate weapons and tools, and engage in over-the-top action-packed naval battles in between causing all manner of havoc on islands. Big action, rule of cool, to hell with historical accuracy and realism.  \n\nOdyssey. A mid-fantasy RPG in an alternate history, with mythological creatures, light magic, and a fun story with choices and consequences. Progression systems and a wider variety of gameplay with less depth. Be who you want to be, play how you want to play, experience a world that is familiar but magical.  \n\nI'm available to work as a product planner if anybody at Ubi is listening. This is easy work.  \n\nIt's terribly annoying for fans as it is, because today we hear \"Assassin's Creed\" and have to figure out which of the above 3 games we're actually going to play, or more likely, what shitty half-assed mix we're getting.",

It was the thing I most looked forward to exploring and getting more context of what Abstergo was actually doing and eventually stopping them while trying to also stop Juno. I really disliked that Desmond was disposed of in the third game like he was. I felt like there was so much more they could have done with him, including doing a modern game where he finally stands off against Abstergo and Juno. Really felt like it could have culminated in Juno showing her true power and control by taking out Abstergo who thought they could control the world through the pieces of Eden and then Desmond facing off against her.",

I loved Revelations and even did the backstory missions for Desmond you can unlock. I was really enthralled by the mystery of it all. The first game created such a crazy world that had so many hints of strangeness and conspiracy. And I think they were doing a good job building off of that with the sequels. But then they killed him and just spun their wheels for the next decade. So disappointing they couldn't make it nearly as engaging again. I think they've been too scared to put the effort in that's necessary to make it as good as the original arc. Because they blew their chances with the BS in black flag and the dumb meta video game shit afterwards. \n\nThe new modern is fine, I don't like Layla but it's alright. I appreciate them trying at least. I'm interested to see where it goes after Mirage",

The first one has not aged well at all. The gameplay loop is literally a) find info about target which you either do through stealing, abducting or eavesdropping, and b) kill target, which usually means just walking up and fighting him because 1 lacked most of the unique ways of assassinating people. The game is a proof of concept and is boring as fuck compared to pretty much every title that followed. \n\nFunnily enough, Unity and Syndicate, two of the most controversial games, had way more freedom of opportunity.",

It had too many (mostly optional) grinding quests and its item system encouraged too much grinding (though the variety and selection was really good).  The setting was absolutely fantastic though and the main plot was strong.  \n\nI think theres absolutely a market for Origins/Odyssey type open world AC-adjacent games, but I sympathize with fans of the older games that want to focus on assassinations rather than just having this big warrior thats constantly in 5v1 battles.  They basically used the AC name to sell a really different game.  I'm glad the fans of the older games appear to be getting something that they haven't gotten in a long time.  I do still want more Odyssey-style games though.  Give me my Alexander the Great game.",

Because the AC series was the fastest selling new IP for Ubisoft, and one of the fastest selling new IPs period for the era.\n\nShe had a contract for three games. They changed plans (AC was originally going to be a trilogy, alternating yearly releases with PoP, but PoP sold like a quarter of what AC1 did so...) but rather than negotiate with her for increased pay, they just killed her character off.",

Nor do i blame Patrice Desilets, who made the decision to fire her because she demanded a percentage of sales rather than a straight salary.\n\nMy point is, they \"changed plans\" precisely because of this, and not for any storytelling reason. If Bell hadn't asked, Lucy wouldn't have been killed off, simple as.\n\nAs for Patrice's (and Corey May's) original plans for AC, anybody could have told you Ubi wouldn't give a fuck about them because they wanted the cash cow.

It's just at the end...well..you know (or maybe you don't,  I won't say more in case you haven't finished it). \n\nI will say though that I think it was a bit different playing them all upon release with the year or so between each. Sure, the modern day wasn't that great looking back (not much gameplay, lots of dialogue and stuff) but it was all building toward something. It was exciting as a thread that bound the games together because of that, not because what happened in each one was that exciting by itself gameplay-wise, if that makes sense. It felt like you were working towards building Desmond into a modern day assassin and it was a huge bummer that they never ended up doing that. I remember sitting there at the end of AC3 with my jaw on the floor because I couldn't comprehend what they'd done.",

Both Robert encounters force the player into open combat, which I struggled with because I avoided combat on my first playthrough. I guess it's my own fault, but the game encourages escaping as a core gameplay pillar. I give the first Robert assassination in Jerusalem a pass, because it's clearly an effective twist when Altair is recognized in the crowd when he's been blending in for the previous 8 targets. But even after that, the rest of the game is forced open combat after open combat until the game ends. And there's a LOT of it. And I really like the combat in AC1. AC2 added more options, but also made it more \"game-y\" in the process by adding clearer enemy archetypes. Then AC3 stripped so many features to the point where enemies didn't even hear footsteps anymore and never escaped from combat. Nearly all human traits were removed from enemies, which is important for a game series where you only fight normal human beings.",

The weakest targets were given more depth than pretty much every antagonist in the whole series. It was just more interesting and unique, and lacked all the baggage of Ubisoft trying to make it into a larger universe. \n\nEvery single AC after it was basically a super hero origin story done over and over again with as little risk as possible. The original control of information and anti-religion plotlines were basically diluted into non-existence with every single game.\n\nThe focus on assassinations and stealth also gave way to repetitive flashy combat(and now a loot based action rpg).",

Like, don't get me wrong, I love the Ezio games, and their stories are fun in that schlocky medieval revenge tragedy kind of way. But the targets all essentially amount to mustache-twirling villains who go around saying \"yeah, we're the bad guys and all we want is world domination.\" AC II (which, again, I love) could have done something much more interesting with Ezio's family and those other guys, the ones that hanged his dad and tried to overthrow the Medicis, but ultimately, it was just \"We're Templars and you're Assassins, so we gotta hate each other.\"\n\nI replayed the original recently, and sure, the \"bad guys\" do a lot of \"bad\" stuff, but they still had some depth to them. It all came down to the order vs. freedom issue, but some of them make some solid arguments - costly naval blockades to force the Crusaders and Saracens to make peace, hoarding resources so they don't go to the war effort, a tough \"law and order\" regime that basically eradicates crime, etc. They were antagonists, they were bad guys and all that, but they weren't just \"evil\" for the sake of being evil like most targets in the games that came after.",

I really wish 3 had explored more of that, but it still kind of treats Connor like he's the good guy even though all he arguably accomplishes is making things a lot worse for most of the people he interacts with.",

Absolutely no bullshit dude who was smart, capable, and was an assassin as you'd expect him to be. But you're probably right AC3 was slightly underrated.",

Abu'l sums up his dilemma with *\"How could I finance a war in service to the same god that calls me an abomination?\"* during his death speech, and one can't help but somberly acknowledge that he simply was born centuries too early or in the wrong society where LGBT-people like him could have been accepted, which leads to him lashing out in cruelty as an act of catharsis.\n\nAbdu'l strangely may be my favourite LGBT-character in video games; there are alot of LGBT-stories that portrays them in either more wholesome manner, or with regular indifference, and those should be celebrated as well. But I've never seen it being portrayed on the opposite side, as a genuine motivation for evilness, that did not made me dismiss it as a two-dimensional portrayal until Abdu'l, and he like many of the other assassination-targets in AC1, brought up valid and poignant points of observation regarding themselves as people, about their human nature and values, yet the somberly solution was them getting a direct stab into the neck due to the direct dangers they became to others.\n\nNot bad at all for the very first entry of a 16 years still running franchise.",

AC *could* be a collection fest if you wanted all the feathers/pages, but it could always be safely ignored. I mean.. who actually did those?\n\nWhen people say Valhalla is a collection fest, they mean it's bloated and a constant leveling grind. It's incredibly different from the original AC's. At least in Odyssey, you had a million markers on your map, and you would have to do them to level up. \n\nPersonally, I hate the new AC's with a passion and have been begging for a return to form, but I'm disappointed with what I see from mirage. It looks like they copy and pasted AC 2 code into a new environment.. why they wouldn't take unity as a template and innovate based on it I have no idea.. why they wouldn't even innovate on AC 2's gameplay i also have no idea.

Even less than perfect games like Syndicate could fall back on having a fantastic urban environment.\n\nMy main issue with Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla is that in focusing on a much wider, predominantly rural open world, they failed to capture the same atmosphere in the major cities. Alexandria, Athens etc all felt incredibly small and shallow. Even Forli and San Gmiginano in AC2 felt more vivid and vibrant and they were minor locations.\n\nAtmospheric, well designed cities are the franchises creative strength - even when everything else is poorly thought out. With these big RPG worlds they stretch themselves too thin and aren\u2019t able to create as strong an environment for players.",

I'm all for a return to roots, and it's good it's at a somewhat discounted price, but I think people wanted more of an evolution than a return to AC2-style gameplay. \n\nIt's hard not to see this as a throwaway release when the graphics aren't impressive and the components are old. It's good that black-box-style missions are here but just feels like the minimum has been done. Personally, I think people wanted another stab at something like Unity with needed improvements.

For that reason, as much as I'd have preferred a big budget Unity-esque evolution, I can understand them spinning this one off from Valhalla's base. \n\nI just hope it's a genuinely good game even if it is more of a return to the old form vs. pushing the boundries on the old formula. It would absolutely suck if the game was bad and then nobody bought it because of that, and Ubisoft then sees that as \"welp, nobody wants the old formula\" lol\n\nI see people saying it's a cash grab or was just a DLC for Valhalla but I think it being a lower-budget test makes sense, and some of my favourite AC games like Brotherhood started off as DLC, so that's really not a huge deal. The game just has to be good, even if it's not the game that totally overhauls the classic formula and evolves it like Unity tried to do.",

They promised that black flag would be returning to its stealth focused roots, then they said the same thing for unity, then syndicate, Valhalla, and now Mirage.\n\nThe only game that really committed to that promise was Unity.

This goes all the way back to AC1.

Also, the map being just a city is good, I'd rather have another densely packed and incredibly detailed Paris than 10 km\u00b2 open world of copy pasted structures and foliage.\n\nBut one thing I noticed is the parkour plays nothing like the original trilogy. In fact, they're doing the exact opposite: veterans liked the slow but highly rewarding climbing that you could optimize by playing enough of the game and figuring out the best paths, but it seems they're just increasing speed in Mirage so you can climb \"in the blink of an eye\".

Meh...\n\nTo be fair, he said \"move from street level to rooftops in the blink of an eye\", not that climbing happens in the blink of an eye. The Ezio games had those insta lifts, so that's pretty par for the course. \n\nI'm currently looking through the vid to see if I can spot an actual climbing section, because so far I can't determine if it's the RPG \"climb anywhere\" system or if it's the handhold system from previous games. I do see specific architecture that looks like bespoke handholds but I'll try to confirm it.\n\nEdit: I don't want to get too excited but if you look at 2:03 when he's pole vaulting you can see the old school AC style handholds on the building. Visible in some other spots as well. I can't imagine they'd model those specific pathway bricks on the buildings if you could climb anywhere, but it is also kinda odd they haven't clarified lol",

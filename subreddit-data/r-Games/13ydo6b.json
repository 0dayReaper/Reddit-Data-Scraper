            "comment": "My kids love Paw Patrol, so I'm relatively up to speed on the show, the movie, the toys, and even the games. Two thoughts I've got here, one important, one not so important:\n\n* Not so important: the trailer looks very unimaginative. Looks slow, dull, uninspired. I'm getting visions of underpaid staff hoping this game boosts their resume *just* enough so they can get other underpaid jobs creating slightly better games. \n* More so important: my eldest got into his mother's Nintendo Switch around age 3, was reasonably good at the controls at age 4, and now devours Mario games religiously at age 5. He got one of the Paw Patrol games last year, for his birthday. However, by the time he was old enough to follow videogame objectives and have a reasonable grip of the physical controls, he was already too old for the very basic gameplay the game offered. He was bored of it within two hours or so, and quickly went back to Super Mario Odyssey. In short, the game targeted an audience that doesn't exist: one that's young enough to find the game fun, but old enough to be able to play it. \n\nI feel from just this one minute trailer alone, the game looks like it may have that same issue. By the time kids are old enough to actually follow a game's objectives, they're too old to get excited over \"lift this trash can from point A to point B to save the day\". So a Paw Patrol game should, I think, either be simplistic with purely technical gameplay and little to no objectives (open world, open ended, player controlled gameplay), or be a *lot* prettier and a *lot* more complex.",

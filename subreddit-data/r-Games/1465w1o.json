Truck and Bus sims are fun enough but real infrastructure just isn't that stimulating to me. Space though?? One of my favorite game moments is me playing Rebel Galaxy, just listening to the Firefly soundtrack while cruising amongst the stars. If this game offers a tiny bit of structure and incentive on top like basic economy and some upgrades, this thing is going to steal hours of my life.\n\nEDIT:[ Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/) is live with some more details and features. Looks really promising.",

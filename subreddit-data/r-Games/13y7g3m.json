            "comment": "I played the original like dozens of times and recently played the demo. I would say it\u2019s about 70% of the look and feel I hoped for.\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing to see a clear reliance on jump scares. The original had very few jump scares- it was always a hostile atmosphere and a gradual introduction of a dangerous entity.\n\nYou\u2019d enter a room in the original and see a ghost on the chair. The music wouldn\u2019t change. Nothing would be out of the ordinary except the silent ghost. It was only when you got too close it would slowly morph into a twister of instant death and even then, only SLOWLY pursue you.\n\nThe demo had creatures popping up and banging on doors. Like most horror.\n\nThe music is spot on I\u2019d say. The characters look good. The dialogue reads like the old letters which is a good sign.\n\nFor now I\u2019d say cautious optimism is warranted but it\u2019s still too soon to say.",

Some flashing scenes with suits of armor moving around, loud bangs on doors you try to open, and an alligator trying to eat you as you walk over a small stream.\n\nMore than the jump scares themselves it has me worried they didn\u2019t really understand what made the first game fun.",

It's made RE2 and dead space wayyy creepier for me when the only clue you have that something is springing at you is the creatures sounds. Also the ambient sounds are scarier to me than the music usually.",

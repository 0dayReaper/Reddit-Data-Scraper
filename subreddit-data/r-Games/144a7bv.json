Hardware seems consistent, at least PS5s are actually moving software at a similar volume this time lol. \n\nAs a side note, I wonder if this thread will get any traction this time around.",

I do like seeing the difference in tastes though.\n\nEtrian Odyssey did well as well! I hope it does okay overall cause I loved that series.",

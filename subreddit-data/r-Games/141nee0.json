And this is coming from someone who has over 500 hrs across different VS clones. What I like about this is the devs understand both the essence of fast paced build-making of VS, and bullet hell games. The first thing: color. The distinct colors makes it easier to abstract away useless information, and distilled down to \"is this object on the screen safe or not?\". No diarrhea-christmas light syndrome like touhou games or bad VS clones that you can't tell what's going on the screen. This means the aesthetic is not just by artistic vision, but a purposeful design choice. I'm can't stress how rare this is in modern games where the visual elements tend to get over-designed.  \nAnyway, I'm looking forward to this.",

The different characters basically just HEAVILY incentivise going for a specific weapon/build, stifling any buildcrafting potential. \n\nLastly, the probably most interesting part of the game which is the upgrade/weapon system was pretty much straight copied from Nova Drift;  theres  an upgrade called \"fussilade\", sitting on the bottom of a \"multishot tree\" that doubles your extra projectiles, exactly the same as in Nova Drift. They even originally copied their early access trailer down to the catchphrase \"survive, evolve, dominate\" (they have since changed the words since people caught on).\n\n\nHonestly, theres very few original ideas in this game. It just seemed like someone wanted to take Nova Drift and hop on the popular Vampire Survivor hype train, without realizing what made either game fun in the first place.",

The game feels a lot more dull than Vampire Survivors, even though I think there's more actual variation in enemy types and how they behave, it feels like you're fighting fewer enemy types because of the lack of visual variety.\n\nEven in the level design, most of the maps in Vampire Survivors feel very different, moreso visually than how it affects gameplay. 20 minutes till dawn has generic unbounded map, generic bounded box, generic infinite horizontal corridor.",

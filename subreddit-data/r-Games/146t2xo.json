    "postText": "Hello /Games! My name is Stefano from Studio Cima and I'd love to show you the game we\u2019re making!  \n[Game trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRLyt_yjxCI)  \n[Steam Demo Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858810/The_Perfect_Pencil/)\n\n**About The Perfect Pencil**\n\nThe Perfect Pencil is a Narrative action adventure with metroidvania elements. It has a specific focus on interactive narrative and choices.\n\nThe game idea was inspired by my experience with an anxiety disorder and my drawings.\n\nIt's also inspired by games such as Hollow knight, Earthbound, Zelda, and a bit of Monkey Island as well as the cinema of David Lynch and Wes Anderson and the artwork of Magritte.\n\nIn the game you'll get to explore a surreal world full of friends and foes, all while trying to find your way out: delve into a dreamlike kingdom and help a camera headed boy overcome his fears while carving your own personal route through the light and the darkness of human nature.\n\nYou can **download and play the game demo right now on Steam**, and we would love to receive any feedback from you! Everything is WIP, so every feedback is much help!\n\n**Platforms and ETA**\n\nThe game will be released in the first half of 2024 for PC and Nintendo Switch. We are also thinking about releasing it on other platforms later on.\n\n**Link and** **Demo**!\n\nHere our links, if you want to help us wishlisting the game, try our demo, follow the development, or talk with us!\u00a0\n\n**Steam**: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858810/The\\_Perfect\\_Pencil/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1858810/The_Perfect_Pencil/)  \n**Discord**: [https://discord.gg/QYqqmvpYgJ](https://discord.gg/QYqqmvpYgJ)\u00a0  \n**Twitter**: [https://twitter.com/perfect\\_pencil](https://twitter.com/perfect_pencil)\u00a0  \n**Mail**: [info@studiocimagames.com](mailto:info@studiocimagames.com)",

We hope you enjoy our take and re-experience that whimsical charm that made the world of Gaia so captivating.",

The rumor seems to be the style of the remake is between FF7R and Crisis Core Reunion, but that leaves a lot of wiggle room for how involved the remake is. Are they just remaking the painted backgrounds with new sprites and make something like Crisis Core where the new graphics just sit on top of the old game? Or are they going full from the ground up remake like FF7R.\n\nIf Square takes the easy way out, like they seem to do so often, than this demo could in fact be more impressive. If all they do is touch up the game with new assets I am not sure how a fully 3D Alexandria wouldn't be more impressive than simply redrawing the pre-rendered background and adding new sprites. Also good to point out the demo has voice acting for all the NPC's. If Square doesn't add voice acting in the new release it could also show this demo to be more impressive. Moguri Mod already does a ton to remaster the original game. So it entirely depends on how much effort Square puts into the remake if this demos style is more impressive.\n\nThe jump from FFIX to this demo is orders of magnitude more impressive than the jump from Crisis Core PSP to The Remake, so only time will tell.",

I don't think most people want that.\n\nWhy do people keep thinking this?\n\nThe main reason FF7R is the way it is is because that's 100% what the devs intended. Why make a single game remake when you can split it into multiple parts, heavily bloat out each part, and make 3x as much?\n\nCompare to FF16, a single yet fully-contained and fully-finished FF game, no bigger in scope than past FFs. I guarantee you the OG FF7 won't be any bigger in scope than FF16, or FF9, or pretty much any FF after FF5.\n\nIf FF9 remake ends up being multiple parts, it's simply because the devs thought \"hey instead of taking this already-40hr game and remaking that, let's take the first five hours, bloat it all to hell with side content and long dungeons, and do that first!\"\n\nAnd this isn't even including Dragon Quest 11 in the convo, a game that easily is over 80+ hours of content from just the main story alone, way larger in scope than FF7R. And that was released as a single game (the re-releases added extra side content/QOL, but it's still the same 80+ hour main adventure).",

A decade or more in multiple parts\n\nIt doesn't seem like this would have the same expansion of the story and locations as FF7 Remake got though (like stretching a 7 hour part of the game to be 35 hours), so in that sense it seems like it could be made in less time.\n\nI wouldn't mind if they spent 7+ years on it though if it was really required, since it already takes 7 years to make a mainline FF game and it's not like the FF9 IP is going anywhere. I'm sure SE wouldn't want that though.\n\nEDIT: not sure why this is so controversial. Do people really think it would take as long to develop a 35 hour remake as a 120 hour remake split into 3 games?",

Not essentially a new game with unrecognizable systems like FF7R?\n\nThis is the perfect Final Fantasy game to stick with the same battle system, gearing, art style, world map etc. FF9 was a love letter to the series as a whole, so keep it that way with the remake. If Squares remake looks like this, obviously with more AAA polish, I think most people would be extremely happy with the result. \n\nBut if they change the battle system, make the cast look like boyband members with modern graphics and get rid of the chibi cartoon style of the original they will hurt the response to this remake. And if they half ass it by not adding voice acting, a 3D world instead of pre-rendered backgrounds, people will still say to just play the Moguri Mod.",

This is basically the only way I could see myself loving the remake as much as the original. If they go the more Dissidia/Kingdom hearts Zidane artstyle I am going to be supremely disappointed. Or if they half ass it and the Moguri Mod is still the best way to experience the game.",

Whereas in the Memoria project, the environment is much more stylized to match character models.\n\nWould be interesting to seem them blend in more of the environment realism.",

There's even a lot of moments where the camera is angled up to show things you literally cant see without doing that. Then a lot of scenes move it upward and angle downward and all those scenes look drastically more dynamic. There's also the fact that it's coming from a game with top down perspectives, so it feels odd to so drastically move the camera without doing it in a stylistic way. Simply placing it behind the character feels remedial in terms of scene framing by comparison.\n\nDownvote me all you want, the entire thing instantly becomes \"obviously just some assets in unreal engine\" once the camera moves into position. It's also dreadfully low due to vivi being 3 fucking feet tall. It looks bad, and if they want to make this look as best it can, they need to do something better than \"unreal engine default character camera\". It's like making a thanksgiving dinner and then using boxed potatoes.",

Still, its one of the best I've ever seen for these purposes! A more polished version of a full game like this would be potentially really fun on its own. Unfortunately, I had a little too much Kingdom Hearts and not enough FFIX feeling at some points. I'll take it as a great fan video and that's all :)",

I think I said to someone earlier that it felt in some small ways more like I was looking at Kingdom Hearts (3?) more than Final Fantasy. Its just something that's hard to describe about the design language. Shiny clay or something. Don't mind me if I don't make sense.\n\nIts actually the details that feel the most off. A stock asset feeling more than something to follow the designs of the PS1 game. Everything big was great, there were so many moments that as a screenshot, would have looked exactly that I'd want a remake to look. It was in the deeper details in gameplay (animations, sounds, UI, voices) that I think something is wrong and its like it merged with Kingdom Hearts, or World of Final Fantasy, or some other Hironobu Sakaguchi game.. that wasn't FF9. But hey its 8-9/10 from me and I'd take it if it looked like this.. but I believe that a release from SquareEnix themselves should be at least a notch better. That 'better' doesn't mean the same as 'graphical detail quality' that you seem to be referring to. Its something that comes through experienced professionals enduring many concentrated design meetings, not fans (even if some are professionals in their own right) coordinating for years remotely, in my opinion. I'd call this video 'technically brilliant', there's just something that doesn't click, where in some official remakes of games, sometimes does.\n\nAKA 'Not My Alexandria' haha (but still great! and I'd buy into it)",

I'm not AGAINST that in a game, but I know I felt something a bit different when I played FFIX. That said, FFIX under Moguri mod on modern screens and viewed as an adult... is indeed not that far apart from this video. Not quite, but closer than I like to admit. I just felt everything looked a bit 'dirtier' than this, when I was a kid playing FFIX several times.\n\nSquare is indeed hit and miss but they still hit well enough for me to want the series to continue. And I really do feel those misses.\n\nI'd be a little surprised if they don't do more than graphics for FFIX. Maybe not a lot more, but the OST could be redone as in other cases, they may or may not do voicing, and we'll have to see how much they touch on content (technically there's already a bunch of publicly confirmed cut content sections that'd be nice to see, let alone the internally known cuts).\n\nFFVIIR was about milking the FFVII world and doing really high quality graphics and gameplay. If FFIX only needs to give everything a major refresh, there's a lot they can do without the budgets getting crazy. I don't expect anything, since I know how annoying SE can be about releases, but there's opportunity.",

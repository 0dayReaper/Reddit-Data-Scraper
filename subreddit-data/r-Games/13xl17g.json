Albeit with a hidden loading screen. It\u2019s impressive and I\u2019m not try to downplay their work but it\u2019s already been done.\n\nHonestly, I wish the multi-playable character thing took off more. It\u2019s a really interesting thing to do if you can write a good story and characters around it and I\u2019m glad it\u2019s coming back here.",

That would be cute, but only about as technically impressive as the \"single-take\" camera work in God of War 2018.\n\nIf it is just swapping models in place, well, Lost Vikings did that on the SNES and Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin did it on the GBA, big hairy deal.",

Like you swing by Central Park and just see Miles fighting some goons on the street corner. So you hop in and help out.

Not trying to hate on the game, I\u2019m sure it will be faster.\n\nWhile not the exact same, this reminds me of Commandos: Strike Force from 2006, which let you swap between three characters on the fly during missions. Much simpler maps of course, but the switching was instantaneous, which was pretty impressive on a PS2.",

It would be kind of funny if you accidentally hit square and now you\u2019re on the other side of the map as the other character. And then, could you just mash that button back and forth? Not complaining I just think that would be funny. GTA V has that map zoom out effect to allow for loading, but I also thought that effect was really cool to show where the new character is relative to where you were. If this is an instant switch, even if it\u2019s to flex the power of the PS5, it might seem a little jarring. Just curious to see this in game.",

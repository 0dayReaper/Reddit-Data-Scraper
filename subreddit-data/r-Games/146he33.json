There's no need to get video games involved.\n\nThere was a time in my life when I was really excited to see a videogame--or a movie, a magazine, anything--with scantily-clad women, and that time ended in 1994 when my parents got internet access.",

In the same way it doesn't hurt to have a handsome character, a muscular character, a beautiful one, one that looks like you or one that looks like what you would like to be, or perhaps one character that looks sexy or wears sexy clothes.\n\nYes I agree that most people doesn't think about if a character should wear this or show that, but the idea of fan service is to please the eye, perhaps without even wanting it.",

I'd rather see more linear titles with a story.\n\nAlso the only call of duty game I've ever played was the first one and I never finished the singleplayer campaign as I got bored of that.",

But it\u2019s also because there are a lot of great/good/fair games that are essentially unknown, and impossible to find because they\u2019re buried under the thousands of crap titles released every month! \nMy wishlist is around 2,000 right now, and it was 1,500 a month or two ago. I\u2019ll never be able to afford to get them, I don\u2019t know if I would end up getting 10% of them even if I did have the money! And I can\u2019t keep up with the releases anymore, my OCD is going bonkers, and I spend most of my time digitally hoarding games that I\u2019ll never play!

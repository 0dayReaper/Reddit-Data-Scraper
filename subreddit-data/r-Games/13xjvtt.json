            "comment": "I love this game. Hundreds of hours. I have it on PC (steam, not gamepass). But they really flubbed the Xbox version. It's constantly behind in updates and launched very buggy. Not sure how much better it is now. Check /r/gunfirereborn if you're gonna play on Xbox. Not sure if the delayed updates was a dev thing or a Microsoft thing but I hope that the PS4/5 versions can be more inline \n\nThe new character dlc just came out for PC and they're super fun to play. An owl with a neat card draw mechanic based on the rarity of your scrolls, and a red panda with a mech buddy you can command and Titanfall down on enemies. It's driven by your little chicken friend lol.",

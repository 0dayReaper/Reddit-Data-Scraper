Double Dragon II: Revenge was my jam back in the NES era. My cousin and I used to play it together through over and over again, always dreading the helicopter interior scene where the door opens occasionally and the airflow tries to suck you out of the copter.\n\nOn a similar note: does anyone remember an indie beat'em up from, I'd say, mid-2000s called Little Fighters 2? It was this anime/chibi-style beat'em up with a pretty decent roster of playable characters, each having their own supermoves (one guy was a bow-and-arrow dude, one had the Goku style Saying hair and could knee kick people off the screen, one was a ninja, one had a spear and so on). The levels were kinda basic, just walk to the left and fight the multitude of enemies that appeared. You could pick up some weapons, baseballs and bottles as well. I think there was also a coop option for like at least 4 players, maybe more and the only limit was the size of the keyboard.",

I'm not totally into the artstyle myself but it's not like Neon wasn't a big departure in a number of ways and that game is well regarded these days.  Then you had the recent DD4 which decided to look almost a exactly like the NES games.  \n\nEven way back in the day, DD was never a consistent franchise.  You had games like DD3 arcade.  that SNES fighting game based on the cartoon which was very unlike the classic games.  There was battle toads and double dragon which was a battle toads game with some DD characters.  It's just a very inconsistent franchise so I don't mind seeing a different take if it's good, much like Neon.  The devs appear to be fans of the series at the very least.  \n\nI hope this turns out well and we get more good DD games on the way.",

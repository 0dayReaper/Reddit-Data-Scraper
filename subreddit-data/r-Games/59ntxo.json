New map packs got a temporary exclusive playlist, then the maps were added to the map lists in general playlists, but weren't mandatory. Eventually they were made mandatory after several months, and only after a reduction in price\n\nEventually they released ODST and included Halo 3's multiplayer with all maps on disc",

BF I bought to support the 10hrs of free gameplay they gave us and now titian fall to support the lack of a season pass. \n\nIf titian fall has cosmetic DLC ill probably buy that too to support them like I do rocket league",

It's well optimised and the movement mechanics are superb for a first-person shooter.\n\nEdit: I'm quite proud of this flawless match I had a few months ago.

People didn't like changes in the beginning, then the devs were very forthcoming with changes, BUT I don't know if the end result actually changed the game for the better or whether people are just happy with the direction the devs have taken.\n\nThat also makes the post-launch phase of the game an uncertainty for me since I can't tell if the devs are gonna keep changing the game as drastically, whether they're gonna turn down or even stop the tweaking and focus on new content instead. Titanfall 1 also had a very strong opening with problems only becoming apparent some time after launch that basically caused it to fizzle out pretty quickly.\n\nAnd lastly, from what I heard they have expanded the setting and narrative and both of it is pretty bland and boring unless you're just in love with the general genre and concepts no matter their actual execution. For the game to be worth full price for me, I'd need either all parts of the game to be very strong or, if the singleplayer does actually turn out to be forgettable, very very strong in the multiplayer department.\n\nI mean, not screwing us over is important, but if the game doesn't seem worth my money, I'll just spend it on other things that also don't screw me over, but also have a good quality:price ratio for me.",

They talked about the 3rd person animations as well but I got the impression it might have been too late to change those for release. (Here's hoping for an option showing up later.)  They also added a lot of content to TF1 post launch so I imagine they will do the same thing with TF2. I expect they'll add an updated version of frontier defense at some point.\n\n\nAll that said i feel the same about making smart decisions about cost to fun/content ratio and it's looking like TF2 will provide a good experience in that regard. I'm willing to support Respawn as well because they've been some cool guys and gals leading up to this release. I hope more developers start communicating with their community/customers as much as Respawn has.",

There's nothing like that in there? No buying \"packs\" of burn cards or anything? \n\nThere have been a bunch of games that launch with no microtransaction system, reap the praise and then patch one in a month later once hype has died down (the last two CoD games have done exactly this, IIRC). So I've been looking for systems in games that *could* later have a \"pay us real money to get this faster\" option patched in.

I followed the news about it pretty regularly.\n\nThe first MW (CoD4) was pretty much all IW. It wasn't until after the success of that game that Activision dug in and started to heavily interfere.\n\nIW didn't want to make MW2 (they wanted to move on to what is now Titanfall), but they also didn't want someone *else* (Treyarch) to make it either.\n\nSo IW leadership came to an agreement with Activision; They would make MW2 and in exchange they would retain rights to the MW brand and any CoD post Vietnam era, Activision could give development of any CoD up through Vietnam era to another developer to make. CoD and MW were going to split up and become their own separate brands going forward.\n\nThat's why CoD:WaW went back to WWII and the first Black Ops was set in Vietnam.\n\nSo after MW2 was such a huge success as well Activision refused to not constantly crank out sequels. It was the best selling game series ever. It *was* the Halo killer.\n\nThrough some fuckery they got rid of any opposition within IW, as legally the rights were held by IW (not the individuals in charge of IW) and Activision *owned* IW.\n\nThey fired the founders, ended up in court, eventually settled, and then started the CoD treadmill back up in modern times with MW3 and all games since.\n\nAs someone who loved MW and MW2, and *hates* the current CoD games, I always like to share these events. A lot of people say \"CoD is the same old game, that's why it sucks. They don't innovate!\"... well you're right that they don't innovate, but they are *not* the same old game either.\n\nOn the surface a lot of things are the same, but under the hood there have been a lot of small changes that add up over time.\n\nMap design, spawn systems, movement mechanics, TTK, weapon balance... all of these things are *very* different now, and make the game a lot less fun for veterans.\n\nThat's why I'm so happy that there is hype for Titanfall 2. These are the guys who made CoD into the success it was (is?). They know how to make a quality product.\n\nTitanfall 1 was ok. Solid game, but hampered by being xbone exclusive and not enough polish. Titanfall 2 feels like the game that should have been. I played the beta and the polish is there, the problems are mostly gone. Plus it runs on dedicated servers (so no client host advantage) like Battlefield, which CoD *still* refuses to do.\n\nI'm really pulling for respawn. They deserve a win.",

Between this and other major releases (Halo 5) moving away from paid MP DLC it may be a sign the industry is starting to turn away from that business strategy.   While I didn't like HOW Halo's pack system worked, it was still a positive in that all future multiplayer DLC was \"free.\"\n\nWhat we have to watch for now, however, is the explosion of microtransactions.  Make no mistake about it, the publishers will want to make up the cost of development through other means and those will likely be microtransactions that go beyond cosmetics.  Halo 5's microtransactions were certainly not just cosmetic.  They dropped weapons and items that were better than the standard loadouts.",

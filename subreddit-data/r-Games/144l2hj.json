Plus it has an absolutely bonkers cross-religion story about YWHW vs Ra vs *Cthulhu* fighting over control of the Earth. That alone made me enjoy it.\n\nOTOH, the dungeons are bland, and the UI is a hassle to deal with.\n\nBut I only paid $5 for it on deep sale, so I was expecting garbage. That it was a \"B-game\" equivalent of SMT made it worthwhile, but I'm not sure if it's worth full price.",

You either chose to ignore it, or you had to babysit everything (good Lord those random attacks) which constantly interrupted your experience with everything else.\n\nThis seems to have solved that issue. You can just buy (or steal) various ships, and you can do straight upgrades to different parts without dealing with snap-building, but its there if you want to get freaky. Outposts also look much less janky.",

You either chose to ignore it, or you had to babysit everything (good Lord those random attacks) which constantly interrupted your experience with everything else.\n\nThe main problem was the baby sitting of the settlers. Like dude, there is corn, tomatoes and wheat. Go make your fucking food. I also built a watch tower, you guys live here, you decide who is guarding the settlement. You shouldn't need me to tell you to guard it.",

I really wish other AAA devs would incorporate some of that into open world design",

I love my open world action games and RPGs, but so many just make a big empty world with nothing in it. Making a \"living world\" isn't easy, I get that. But if I can't interact with anything on my merry journey, I'm literally just sightseeing from point A to point B, which doesn't feel good. \n\nThe good old \"wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle\" can describe so many open world games recently, in terms of what you do in the world. And most of them boil down to collecting materials while going from place to place.\n\nBethesda has somehow managed to hit a weird middle point. They make grand open worlds, but it's a lot of the same you do or fight, so it gets a bit dull and repetitive. But they also manage to make worlds that just keeps rewarding exploration even hundreds of hours later.\n\nHonestly cannot wait for this game. Idc if it's a buggy mess or not, the potential is there and all I saw looked amazing.",

Huge amounts of the time it has taken has been figuring out how to make the scale and detail of that game work in multiplayer, and without loading screens. Starfield using loading screens to break the game into separate chunks and not worrying about any kind of multiplayer, plus as you said not simulating everything in as much detail, significantly reduces the technical problems they needed to solve.\n\nAnd to be clear, that's not a negative thing against Starfield, it's smart decision making to put their resources where they will matter most. It has allowed them to make a game with this scale and detail in a reasonable amount of time, and hopefully to a high quality bar!",

Netcode is HARD, even more so when you're dealing with enormous maps and lots of players and want to make it all feel responsive and seamless. There's a reason the tick rate for EVE's megaserver is slow as hell (one server tick per second, which works ok for EVE's mechanics, but anything more action-y wouldn't be playable like that), and why MMOs have largely stayed away from shooter combat (with a couple of exceptions, all of which generally made major concessions to map scale, the quality of the gunplay, or other areas).",

Extensive character creation, but you can just fly through it if you want. Deep ship building, but if you don't want to engage with that much you can just buy a premade, etc.",

They show the player stumbling upon a pirate overrun facility, an abandoned location, and a cave.\n\nSo my assumption is that it will be kind of like skyrim's lesser dungeons/caves/bandit camps that are just dropped at random as you explore the planets. You'll walk for some time, see an icon on your map, and can go to some handcrafted content that fits the location you're exploring.",

But no, holy shit, Bethesda blew my expectations out of the fucking water.\n\nThat ship customization alone blew my mind. It is what I've wanted from space sim games for YEARS. The ability to not only change weapons and paintjobs, but to swap out, add or remove entire systems, rooms, modules, engines, cockpits? You can't find that level of modularity and customization anywhere else in the genre. And then you can hire crews for your ships? And companions can become crew members? Incredible.\n\nAnd then the actual space combat and mechanics is everything Star Citizen wishes it was. Power allocation, subsystem targeting, different weapon types and classes, giant capital ships with full interiors, *boarding*, communication with other vessels, *piracy*. I love it.\n\nLike it seems like Starfield is just an incredible space sim ON-TOP OF a Bethesda exploration and questing RPG. Not to mention that the character combat they showed off today looked leagues better than what they had shown before. I think Bethesda has another Skyrim-level success on their hands, because buggy mess or not Starfield looks fuckin incredible.",

In some RPGs, however, you're limited in the number of companions who can accompany you, especially if your playing style doesn't suit having companions. \n\nGames like Dragon Age and RDR2 resolved this with their camp systems, meaning you'd regularly revisit the game NPCs over and over again. And I think the ship/outpost system in Starfield will let you do the same. You can constantly be revisiting a companion even if they aren't accompanying you on missions. \n\nI really hope that's something Bethesda take advantage of.",

They would have deemed early on that the technical cost of making their engine work with seamless worlds and all the associated gameplay things like a difference between atmospheric and space flight, what happens if you approach a city, performance, etc. was too much. \n\nIn the last showcase Todd Howard was carefully avoiding the specifics of how you travel, but I'm almost certain that it's going to be a planet UI/menu that you spin around and click on, then it either loads a cell or procedurally generates one if you clicked in random place with no points of interest. Then there's a cutscene and your ship spawns you on the surface.",

I'm sure they deemed it not worth the time it would have taken to rebuild the engine to support the feature.",

Sometimes it works by immersing you more but sometimes it makes you feel like a bland cardboard box. You end up walking around and everyone is worshiping you\n\nThe shard, artifact thing from the main quest feels like something from Mass Effect 1. At this point finding an alien artifact is a space trope I want games to avoid but we'll see",

It got old in FO4 because every companion and settler were interchangeable. Being able to build a science outpost and specifically send scientists there, and having that matter in terms of your research production or whatever, will make it feel a lot more connected to the game world.",

FO4 settlements just bored and annoyed me after the first couple ones and building things was just a pain sometimes.\n\nThis though oh I love this. Just setup mining outposts so I don't have to farm mats myself, research outposts to unlock research while I just go and do whatever I want to do in between. Love it.\n\nOh and the isometric view for building the outposts is going to make building things so much easier.",

I love the idea of being able to build a massive farming outpost that produces food which is then sent to a mining outpost where farming isn't quite possible there. Even though farming takes place in the habitats, I hope the outside environment does have an effect on it. Build an outpost on a desert or snowy planet and it becomes much harder to produce food. It's still possible, but they don't get as much as an outpost that's on a lush jungle planet.\n\nThat's where Fallout 4 failed. If you had more than one settlement you didn't even need to set up trading routes between them because they could produce whatever they needed themselves.",

They also hate Preston for the same reason.\n\nIn my first playthrough, I did the Concord quest, went to the Drive-In, set up my own settlement, and literally never saw Preston again.",

I got really frustrated with FO4 settlement building because I'm kind of a perfectionist, so getting buildings \"right\" proved really tough. I'd rather just let the AI build it for me.\n\nBut this? Looks like everything snaps together cleanly. And is built on stilts so it looks clean at any height.",

In Fallout 3 there were 3 large cities (Rivet City, Megaton, Underworld) and about half-a-dozen smaller ones. In Skyrim there were 4 major cities (bigger than the average city in Oblivion) and 4 large villages. \n\nBut in Fallout 4 there was only 1 major city (Diamond City), 2 smaller hand-made settlements (Goodneighbour, Vault 81), and... that's about it. The rest were 'settlements' which had much less unique content.",

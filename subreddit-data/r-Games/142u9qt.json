Even an arrow has impact, so a silenced bullet is not slower. That's how physics work. Being silenced does not go against clearing smoke. Silenced is for audio, not for visual.\n\nIt depends on how the new physics engine of CS2 works and if they have special rules for silenced bullets. If CS2 does it properly, then the smoke will be affected by a silenced bullet.",

Maybe cosmetic attachments, so that you could make a Mk 18 Mod 1 out of the M4A4, you just wouldn't be able to use sights, lasers or put suppressors on guns that didn't already have them. I don't think Valve would do that though, people seem to be more interested in the flashy paint jobs.",

I get they wanted to stretch the content out for the hardcore, but I took \"breaks\" multiple times upon realizing I'd need to grid for widgets for literally days to max out a cool gun I just found.",

I'm not sure if it was their specific balancing or just the fact it's normal guns against normal humans but the sponginess just felt awful when you unloaded a gun into an enemy and their health barely budged.\n\nI do wish the game had not been a looter shooter and had leaned more into the survival/dark zone concepts more. The initial gameplay trailer for the first game had them scavenging for supplies at a police station and while I know not to expect those kinds of trailers to accurately reflect gameplay, it would have been nice if they had kept at least some of that design direction.",

So no multi colored loot(^(common=white, rare=purple, legendary=orange)) no damage numbers, no gear score and none of all that RPG'ness. And the game was amazing in my opinion.\n\nUsing tactics and strategies to take down the enemy instead of using weapons and gear with bigger numbers on them.\n\nYou die quick if you get caught slacking and the enemies die quick as well. \n\nSo to win, you have to out-think your opponent and you got a LOT of tools to make all kinds of tactics and strategies, from using drone strikes, stealth, ambushes, sniper positions, breach and clear, guerilla warfare tactics, hold the line all out fire fights, and everything in between.\n\nFor example: im hinding in the bush, my three AI team mates are behind me, we see two targets on patrol walking towards us. I mark one of the targets for my AI team mate, and they will snipe the marked target on my command. I wait for them both to walk by as I continue to hide. when their backs are facing me, I sneak up to the un-marked target, and when im in grabbing range, I give the command to snipe the marked target, and the unmarked target gets spooked as his partners head just explodes and before he even has a chance to react, I grab him from behind and slit his throat. then I drag both bodies into the bushes so other enemies cant see their bodies and go into alert status for the whole base.\n\nThis is the type of stuff you will be doing the whole damn game.\n\nIf your looking for a realistic tactical espionage type game with or without human/AI teammates, this is the game for you. \n\nI liked it better than i like wildlands.",

As a player, you're helping to rebuild co-operative communities... but they have pretty much _zero_ influence beyond their tiny little patch, and once their part of the plot is done with, they just kinda... _exist_ without growing or changing, so they're politically irrelevant. The only tool the game gives you to resolve conflict is lethal force... but it's only used against relentlessly murderous cults... some of which kinda have a point... but they take it _way_ too far...\n\nThere's something for everyone to hate :)",

And while I didn't like the story of the game, I do get the appeal (although, I still say that your enjoyment solely relies on how much you hate CoD), but I don't think that kind of story would fit every game, neither less as live service one such as The Division.",

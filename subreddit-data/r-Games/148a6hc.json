            "comment": "\u201cDuring the past years, Embracer invested significantly both in acquisitions and into a strategy of accelerated organic growth,\u201d Wingefors explained.\n\n\u201cWe have acquired some of the world\u2019s leading entertainment IP and we have invested into one of the largest pipelines of games across the industry. The program presented today will transform us from our current heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business this year.\u201d\n\nThe new restructuring will result in job losses. \u201cEmbracer currently engages close to 17,000 people and while that number will be lower by the end of the year, it is too early to give an exact forecast on this,\u201d Wingefors said.\n\n\u201cIt is painful to see talented team members leave. Our people are what make up the very fabric of Embracer. I understand and respect that many of you will be worried about your own position and I don\u2019t have all the answers to all questions. I want to be clear that the decisions about this program were not taken lightly.\n\n\u201cI am asking all our managers to lead and act with compassion, respect, and integrity. Throughout each phase and wherever possible, we will work to ensure that affected team members receive information first. Where we can, we will try to provide opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects.\u201d\n\nExplaining the company\u2019s plans in more detail, Wingefors said: \u201cThe actions will include, but not be limited to, closing or divestments of some studios and the termination or pausing of some ongoing game development projects.\n\n\u201cIt will also include decreased spending on non-development costs such as overhead and other operating expenses. We will reduce third party publishing and put greater focus on internal IP and increase external funding of large-budget games.\n\nWingefors also noted that the planned game cancellations will \u201calmost entirely be around unannounced projects,\u201d stating that \u201call announced significant releases will still be released as planned\u201d.\n\nConcluding, Wingefors wrote: \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we have built over the past years, and we should acknowledge that we are heading into a solid year with many amazing releases such as Remnant 2, Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, Payday 3, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged, Arizona Sunshine 2, Alone in the Dark, Homeworld 3, and many many others.",

            "comment": " Sounds like they're completely changing what their whole thing was, unfortunately. Their approach of taking the time to make relatively smaller games in old but beloved series to give them a broad variety of different stuff was pretty nice, they bought so many different IPs that would be great to see a new game for. It seems like that is being abandoned to just focus on milking the big IPs without much care and that's just such a shame.\n\nJust the way he talks about LOTR going on about needing to \"exploit\" it more and \"It's just a better use of resources than other projects\" doesn't bode well, nothing about quality or care or respect towards the IP, just comes across as \"We can squeeze so much more money from this, all that matters\". Gives the impression they're going to be chasing whatever trends will get the most profit regardless of how they do it or what it means for other things.\n\nLike, something like SpongeBob Squarepants battle for bikini bottom or Destroy All Humans are classic games from years ago that people liked but they were still niche and weren't big brands. And they remade both of them and they sold well enough to get more games after that first release, they pretty much revived the series. I can't see that sort of thing happening anymore,  I expect they'd just have gone \"Not worth our time\" to those ideas because they aren't huge IPs they can \"exploit\" to an absurd degree.",

Because of the law in EU most companies settle for compensation with their employers when doing staff reduction because it's cheaper for them than losing in court.

Some of it is warranted for various reasons, but what do they think is going to happen if unions are involved?  Costs will go up.

The legacy console versions are way better than the current unified mess.",

Which really, only exists as environmental lore-drop set dressing with a couple biome specific enchants to get and a new disc.\n\nThe pointed dripstone is cool, but based on how quick there were backport mods for Caves and Cliffs, it couldn't have been that hard to make an infinite lava source for a modder. As a result of the world generator being redone, the _old_ structure pieces that used to spawn in now clash _awfully_ with the new cave systems, 'dungeons' and mineshafts both; neither of which have been touched, like... Caves and Cliffs was _not_ the bombshell you seem to think it is. I was a little annoyed that we wound up waiting as long as we did for _that alone,_ with 1.20, I'm at a point where it's \"yeah wake me if something _**substantial**_ happens like we're back in infdev or smth. Otherwise, I've got Thermal workshops to attend to.\"",

It's like if the producers of your favorite movie took it and just added a mediocre side plot to it, But you are allowed to skip it or watch an old version if you want to, so no harm right? But then they did it again and again.\n\nHere is a sample of my personal issues (heavily condensed):\n\n- various biomes and locations are lacking of meaningful content: the Nether, the End, the entire surface, oceans, dungeons, strongholds, abandoned mineshafts, villages, the new deep dark biome, and I can keep going. Some of these have improved but they still lack anything that makes them actually fun to deal with and not just 30 minute distractions or neat set dressing.\n- various systems are very unfun, either because they are too tedious (enchanting, potions, bulk crafting, traversal with horses/minecarts) or too easy once you know what you are doing (villager trading for enchanting/farming/resource collection in general, traversal with elytra) or both at the same time. The parts that are too tedious often can be solved by extreme game knowledge and complicated redstone, but I don't think it is reasonable to expect the average player to delve that deep into the mechanics.\n- combat is still very very poor even after an (imo) amazing update. There are options on how to fight but it never gets deep leading to generally an easy path to optimal play rather than a wide variety of nearly equally viable playstyles. Adding just minor variations to some of the weapon and armor properties would go a long way.\n- inventory management is an absolute nightmare. There are simply too many items that you need to have while building, and too many resources that you can collect while mining. Their solution to it is an endgame item that acts as a portable chest, but while it helps it does not solve the issues.\n\nAll in all if they stopped updating and called it feature complete ages ago, few people would have minded. But they kept adding mediocre stuff (though not all mediocre). They seem to add mostly shallow content (this was a complaint even back in beta, see wolves), refuse to add meaningful stuff to existing systems, are ok with broken systems just existing, and are largely allergic to automation (I don't think anyone is happy with the way that allays turned out). The game is great already, but adding mediocre content sours the experience for people who want to be excited for new things. Especially when mods and other games seem to do it so much better.\n\nIdeally, for me, they would stop developing new features for the game and just focus on a sequel that expands and changes a lot of stuff. The current state of the game is just getting more and more bloated as time goes on rather than getting better.",

The Warden might be too scary for younger players. They changed ore generation levels and made mining slower with deepslate. They made netherite armour harder to get for some reason. Most players don't even go to the End, yet they still had an update add End cities and elytras.\n\nAs for mods that improve vanilla:\n\n* Terralith adds TONS of biomes only using vanilla blocks\n* Yung's Better Structures change structures like dungeons and pyramids to be more advanced and allow more exploration to them\n* Swing through grass. Seriously it's so dumb that grass blocks block your attacks\n* Apple skin makes the hunger bar system more transparent to the player\n* Quark adds various kinds of things like more redstone automation blocks, various kinds of items like a boomerang, and quality of life features like a button that automatically sorts inventory and an inventory search bar for chests.\n* Some of the mobs from Alex mobs like Elephants, Raccoons, Seals, Crows and etc look like mobs Mojang would add to the game anyways, on top of having more interaction and utility than whatever Mojang pushes out for their mobs.",

I played a little bit of this game in middle school, had my fill, felt like I got my money's worth, and moved on.\n\nBut if you look at this sub, you'd almost think it's a war crime what they did to this game, while from my eyes, with the few times I've launched the game since I graduated, it looks like there's been drastic improvements over the years. And since modding is in the game, any issues that people do have could be easily fixed with community support anyway. So, idk, I just don't really get the hate the game gets. To me it looks like people are complaining that the game isn't constantly evolving with them as they age, even though they've probably gotten their money's worth.\n\nBut I could be way off base.",

I give no credit to Bethesda for the mod that makes dragons less annoying, just like I give no credit to Mojang for Terralith.\n\nAlso in order to really dramatically improve the game, they have to do something risky and controversial. That's the reality of how it is. Changing how enchanting is just dumb rng or is broken by villager trading, would be controversial. Changing tool/armour upgrading to something like Tinker's Construct where you can manually craft and customize tools without rng would also be controversial. Mojang either has the choice to bite the bullet and revamp their shitty enchanting system or lay in their bed they made.",

Im addition, if they make promises that they'll add specific features in their marketing, then they should follow through. I know they didn't on some things like RTX, but I don't think they ever promised the level of support people have been demanding 12 years later... \n\nBut even still, why didn't these complaints exist years ago? To my eyes, it seems all of these complaints about Minecraft updates started years after 1.0. People were perfectly content at what they bought for years, even years after MS bought them, but now it's an issue in the last 5 or so. I don't understand that shift.\n\nI guess, if I'm trying to not beat around the bush anymore, that I feel this (in my eyes) recent pushback against the game is more of a response to live service games becoming more and more of a thing. I think expectations have changed, and now a smaller subset of fans are expecting the developers to do more with it when it's not really financially sensable to do so.

People criticized how fractured the caves and cliffs update was into different portions and how disappointing 1.19 was with not having all of the teased features in it.\n\nI wouldn't criticize them on the basis of them being live action if they didn't make a good base game.

In the span of a few months we got such integral blocks as ladders, signs, doors, minecarts, spawners, buckets, boats and more, and systems-wise we got *the entire redstone system*, farming, fishing, and an entire new dimension with the Nether. All while the game was still being made by one person.\n\nThat's what I miss. New blocks that *actually do things*. New systems that add *things to do*. There's a massive lack of interactivity with many of the blocks despite the potential for much more (as seen in mods). Of course, there are *some* decent additions that have been made since 1.0, and I don't expect mind-blowing new systems every update, but really, a glance at [the version timeline](https://minecraft-timeline.github.io/) says it all.\n\nThe other half of it is that for all the praise Minecraft gets as a creative building game, there's a dearth of actual decorative blocks to use. We have to jerry-rig \"furniture\" together from other blocks because there still isn't even a chair block in the game. Stairs are still the closest thing to a sloped block there is. Want to build a modern city, an industrial scene, East Asian architecture, or anything else with any sort of actual detail? You're gonna need mods.\n\nIt doesn't bother me too much though, as I've long since given up on Minecraft ever receiving any substantial updates again, or becoming an actual game like we thought it would back in the infdev days. Now I'm just glad we have games like Dragon Quest Builders 2 that show us what's possible when you give the Minecraft concept to a team that actually knows how to make a game.",

This seems like a kids' game to get new people into the franchise, not an entry for diehard veterans looking for another Mania.",

The only others that I can think of are the under ship segment in Flying Battery Zone and a couple of switch pits in Mystic Cave Zone. The entire point of classic Sonic is to have verticality to the levels to help keep you from fall hazards. Advance had a ton of segments that are designed to kill you if you haven't memorized the sequence, probably to extend playtime.",

Speed is the reward for learning the levels and how they work; you can\u2019t go fast all the time when you\u2019re first playing through them, and sometimes you do have to slow down and pay attention.  The classic games are designed to be replayed over and over as you learn the more optimal routes (which are generally speaking, the top routes in the levels).\n\nAdmittedly, the very first Sonic game is probably the worst offender when it comes to throwing unexpected obstacles, but I\u2019ll cut it some slack for being the very first game in the series where they hadn\u2019t completely settled on what \u201cSonic\u201d was yet, and being a product of its time.",

A Souls vet notices the attack telegraphs pretty damn well. It's just naturally difficult, so it takes people a while to overcome, especially since the game can be played with countless different builds. Even on the hardest fights, if you play cautiously/defensively enough, just trying to read the fight, you can still first-try the harder bosses. Even without doing that you can first-try plenty of them.  \nIt's entirely different from a platfomer where you literally cannot react to what's happening due to bad design.  \nAnother example of trial-and-error design is the game series revolving around \"I Wanna Be the Guy\".

But the level design and controls suffered so much in that transition that the vast majority of his outings have ranged from terrible to mediocre",

In 2D all of sonic's friends were basically newgame+, where they all were sonic with different abilities. Tails was sonic but he can fly. Knuckles is Sonic but he can climb, etc. It felt just as fun to run through stages over again with them and explore new places you might not have reached before. \n\nBut in 3D instead of doing that, his friends usually had wildly different gameplay styles that only existed to pad out the game. now Knuckles was doing scavenger hunts and and Tails was either driving a robot around or running along truncated versions of sonic's levels.",

My first thought was how on earth am i going to even be able to pay attention to what sonic is doing outside of the bumper speed sections. \n\nIf they feel the need to pull the camera in that close, it CAN work.. but the game needs to slow down (which it does in a few platforming sections where the game actually looks very nice/fun). But thats also anti-sonic game. Going fast works when you're not shoving random speed bump enemies that punish you for not being in a ball. Going fast works when thats all you have to pay attention to because the game is essentially putting you on rails. Going fast &amp; having to maneuver is a hard stunt to pull off and I just don't see it working out for a \"3d\" game. \n\nWas always of the opinion that sonic shined best when they gave you the speed and multiple paths through a stage. Platforming is fun but theres already plenty of games out there that do it better and its a core concept, not something tacked on.",

Even back in Super Mario World, Mario\u2014who doesn't move anywhere near as fast as Sonic\u2014is still slightly offset from the center of the screen so as to allow the player to better see what is ahead. And Mario games since then have him offset even more.\n\nI think another big issue with Sonic is that the camera follows him even when he jumps, so it becomes more difficult to see what is below. If you're plummeting off a ledge the camera should shift so that you can see more of what is beneath Sonic, and if you're just jumping in place the entire screen should not move if you're simply landing at the same elevation.",

Let it \"play itself\" and you'll either be stuck in an infinite loop of bouncing between springs or thrown into some random part of the level and probably some spikes.\n\nThe vines are designed so when you understand how high they take you, you can skip ahead, get to other vines, etc.",

After what a critical success it was, you\u2019d think wanting more of that would be reasonable. But it largely looks to have sidestepped for the other 2D/3D Sonic design, WHICH IS FINE, but it\u2019s still a deviation from the originals that isn\u2019t \u201can evolution\u201d if it brings the other shortcomings we\u2019ve seen with empathizing \u201caction\u201d over \u201cgood gameplay\u201d.\n\nGranted, this game isn\u2019t even out yet, so I\u2019ll really hold until then.

                    "comment": "HOLD YOUR HORSES, THIS IS A BIG ONE~\n\n&gt; You can barely see where you're going, so you're not really being reactive.\n\nReactivity is subjective, but even besides that, Sonic explicitly has tools and abilities that circumvent that, namely rolling, which not only makes you invincible to most enemies but faster downhill. \n\n&gt;  The game is designed to go fast but the stages are littered with obstacles you couldn't possibly respond to before memorizing the entire stage. \n\n*Sonic* has roots in arcade and so is literally designed to be replayed, which is why there's alternate routes. And again, Sonic's moveset helps you even if you are not the fastest reactor. More than memorization, understanding how Sonic plays is a crucial aspect of the games. \n\nWhenever I hear this, I wonder why *Sonic* is the only franchise to be criticized for having... obstacles? *Generations* have all of these trappings and less intuitive physics,  so saying it's the *only* good version of the idea is quite the take. \n\n&gt; There's no benefit to going faster, so it's not encouraging you to find optimal routes or anything\n\nObjectively untrue. In fact, *what*? Not only is being fast the *point of the game*, but being fast makes the game feel better, play better, and feels more rewarding when you keep that speed. Bouncing on enemies, spin dashing, using level gimmicks, avoid obstacles, all the ways it makes being fast awesome.\n\nIn another comment you say\n\n&gt; The level design also feels so discordant and thrown together that there's no intuitive feel for \"i'm going the faster way\"\n\nwhich is completely untrue. The idea of \"highest route fastest, lowest route slowest\" is a key part of Classic *Sonic* design,and is why verticality is sought after.\n\nThis is also intuitive: lower routes would obviously have bottomless pits, but they also have more enemies and obstacles; higher routes have more open space to use to build speed (and sometimes just straight up skip entire level design). Higher routes require good timing and speed to get to, so you are rewarded for playing well. This is a design detail you understand when you replay the game for the optimal route, and one you miss if you are only preoccupied with getting from A to B.\n\nAgain, why is *Sonic* specifically not allowed to have obstacles? Yes, it's annoying to get hit and lose Rings, but you can just pick one up and move on. \n\n*Sonic* is about being fast, which apparently translates to people as \"I should be able to hold right and always be fast.\"\n\nIt's like saying Piranha Plants in *Mario* is bad design because it's an enemy you can't jump on and have to time and adjust your jumping. \n\n&gt; And doing that requires multiple runs anyway-\n\nIf you want the best times, yeah? What good is speedrunning if you can achieved the most optimal time first try?\n\nWhy is it a problem that you need to replay the game to get the most out of it? Because *Sonic* games are about speed, they're remarkably short. Replayability is the source of their longevity. \n\n&gt; I know the 3D Boost sonic style is contentious but it does encourage all these things and make them actually work. \n\n3D Boost *Sonic* has a radically different goal and intention. It is only superficially the same. Not saying those games are inherently superficial, but that it is a different game from the classics. \n\nEDIT: I know I argue later that these games share both the same qualities and issues, so let me reiterate: how Boost *Sonic* makes those things work is through entirely different design philosophies.\n\n&gt; You can do pretty well on most stages your first time around\n\nFrom how I see people play those games, uh, I need receipts for that, lol. \n\nA non-zero amount of people I've seen play these games don't get the concept of *a button that makes you go fast.* And just because it's in 3D doesn't make those games any easier to react to, especially when its speed is pretty binary.\n\nThere are a lot of idiosyncrasies in Boost *Sonic* that can make it as difficult to play as the classics. A lot of obstacles to avoid, and reliance on replayability for maximum fun.\n\nWatching and listening to how people play these games, it seems that people don't actually take it seriously or want to understand *how* they're played.",

The level design also feels so discordant and thrown together that there's no intuitive feel for \"i'm going the faster way\", whereas in the boost games, you can tell which ways are best and it's often a lot easier to find where one path leads into or branches off from another one.\n\nI think Sonic peaked at Sonic Unleashed style stages and everything else is just a *mess*.",

I'd say of *all* games, *Unleashed* relies more on being able to react, ESPECIALLY if you want to avoid obstacles while keeping your speed.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the literal QTEs. \n\n&gt;  and the platforming plays directly into the speed and picking routes and stuff.\n\nBoost games are the worst in terms of platforming, for the simple idea that Sonic's normal running speed is slow and stiff, and his boost speed is for obvious reasons not at all good for platforming unless you are REALLY good at the game.\n\nDid I mention that *Unleashed* is the only game where the \"home into enemies\" button and the \"boost uncontrollably\" button are the same? \n\nOf course, these games use different forms of platforming in response, but I say it's one of its biggest issues of the boost games and why they often have boring and blocking platforming.\n\n&gt; perfecting a level feels like mastering the controls and almost like 100% comboing a rhythm game stage. \n\nSo does Classic Sonic. You don't achieve that mastery without replaying the stage, avoiding obstacles that kill your speed, and finding the best route.\n\nSure, in the boost games, it takes less effort to be and maintain 700MPH (a simple button press compared to relying on pinball-and-momentum physics) but some of the same obstacles are still there.\n\nIf you are a slow player, you are going to have a bad time.\n\n&gt; whereas in the boost games, you can tell which ways are best and it's often a lot easier to find where one path leads into or branches off from another one.\n\nI'll say this clearly: no you can't. Because of the 3D space, even when its a linear corridor, it is harder to see and react and especially to know if it's the best way. \n\nThe \"highest route fastest, lowest route slowest\" design philosophy is harder to apply and less intuitive in 3D.\n\nAnd this is a critique of an individual problem, but because of the boost games' linear design, those \"branching paths\" lose their appeal when you're just still going forward, making them feel the same. At worst, you don't even get branching paths. Sometimes you get wildly different paths, but it's harder to tell if it's \"the best\" path.\n\nI can easily see why you would enjoy the boost games more, and that's not at all an insult to you or those games, but a lot of what you like in those games are present in the classics. The boost games just immediately fulfill the \"gotta go fast\" idea of *Sonic*, which I think is a poor interpretation of *Sonic* that for some reason makes people hate when it has obstacles or require momentum.",

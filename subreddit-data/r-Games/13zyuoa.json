The world of Columbia is a wonder to walk through, really evoked a cool summer walk through a local city for me, an nice feeling during the peak of a British winter. The level that starts with you washed up on a beach with a twist on 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' was wonderful. The concept and theme of the game is incredibly interesting, even if the whole \"America needs to self reflect\" motif has been used a lot since; the uniqueness of their approach is still quite interesting. I also find parts of the Comstock-Elizabeth-Booker relationship to have some interesting nuggets.\n\nBut there is also a lot of places it falls short, and most disappointingly, it's in the gameplay. The guns look nice, but they feel weak and offer very few ways to mix up the gameplay, especially when you're only limited to two weapons. I found myself wanting to use the grenade launcher, RPG and Shotguns, but I rarely found the justification to use anything but the machine gun and sniper rifle. The Founder/Vox Populi variants were also quite disappointing. Then there is the Vigors: they really felt watered down compared to Bioshock 1 and 2's Plasmids. I was excited to see achievements for combos, but those were very lacklustre. I almost exclusively used just the Bucking Bronco and Devil's Kiss, and even their use was sparsely needed.\n\nFinally, the story just kept absolutely hitting or missing. Elizabeth's first few moments were very interesting and it was wonderful diving into her experiencing the outside world for the first time. The unravelling of Booker's history and his examinations of the world were also fun to watch. But as time goes on so many questions kept getting raised with increasing annoyance. Are they just abandoning their own timelines and leaving awful worlds in their wake? Do they exist in the timelines they jump? What was the motive of the Luteces? How big actually is Columbia? What was up with that Bird Cult? How do these ghosts work? How was Booker going to become Comstock when he had already sold his daughter? Alone these aren't big deals, but over time it begins to add up.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy I've played it and it does hold up very well on current devices, for a decade old game. I only experienced one or two bugs. But after returning to it I think I'd stick it as a solid 7/10. Competent, well put together in an interesting universe and some pretty strong characters, but it lacks in a fulfilling gameplay loop and cohesive story.\n\nOn a final note, Bioshock 2 was the only one I had never played before out of the three and I was honestly really happy with it. I think it may be my favourite one.",

He takes all your guns, leaving you with your wrench and Plasmids. This is the game teaching you that Plasmids are an important part of your combat arsenal, not just glorified QuickTime events when you see the environmental prompt to use them.\n\nIn contrast, Infinite starts you with Possession, a situational and extremely expensive Vigor. Unlike 1 and 2, you can't carry more Salts with you, and you don't have Elizabeth to replenish your resources yet. So your only Vigor costs half your Salts, only affects relatively rare enemies, can easily miss for no effect, and is difficult to replenish. It sends the message that Vigors are a precious resource with little combat application that should be hoarded as a limit break for particularly difficult encounters, otherwise relying on your guns. *Which is not how you should play 90% of the game.*",

I feel like, since it got so much praise at release, some folks have to make sure to remind the world that they didn\u2019t like the game for whatever reason.  \n  \nIt\u2019s not a perfect story and totally has flaws, but Bioshock Infinite has a fairly solid and enjoyable story that\u2019s fairly tight narratively speaking, despite its flaws. It feels like Capital G Gamers just have this sort of ongoing vendetta against this game",

Nope. \n\nA \"huge\" boss fight with the Songbird? Nope. \n\nThe game isn't overall terrible and I do think it's worth playing, but as someone who was beyond excited I ended up disliking the story more and more as it went on. Though the worst thing about the game was its sole boss fight with a ghost that felt super out of place.",

But more particularly, it was in conversation with the idea of ludonarrative dissonance, which was a hot topic in games criticism at the time. How can you be the good guy while you're massacring hundreds of nameless goons? Well, they're the bad guys, and the good guys are also the bad guys, and all of this is inevitably fated by a meta-narrative contrivance that is only revealed to you piecemeal as the story progresses. It *wants* you to feel uncomfortable about the revolutionaries also being bad guys, because that's the whole point it wants to make: in this game, *you* are the ultimate bad guy. It's a game about the conflict between what games make the player character do and how game stories want you to feel about your character. \n\n\nIt's not particularly profound, but it's reasonably well executed, and it's the kind of story that can only be told in this sort of interactive medium.",

People expected a complex game with maps that you have to move a lot between places, with a lot of verticality, and lots of decisions that mattered (which was presented in the trailers). Then you start the game and it is totally linear and your decisions don't really matter and they tell you directly that your decisions don't really matter. Then, the puzzles were weak and nono-existing and there was no final boss. Which i totally get why, but cynical me still things it was because they promised a lot but couldn't made what they wanted.\n\nI gotta praise them for their characters, but in many ways it was like watching \"Amnesia: A machine for pigs\" all over again, being a weak sequel for a greater original game.",

Perhaps it's the subset of people that /r/games attracts, or perhaps it's a side effect of the way the voting system on reddit works, but when a game that acclaimed gets predominantly negative attention in the comments section, it's strange to see, and that's probably why the person you responded to felt like it was some kind of mission that people are on.  As a fan of the game too, it's exhausting to see an article come up for one of my favorite games and everyone needs to let you know they disliked it.  I don't know what it is about the game that attracts its critics to the comments section for this game in particular, or Fallout 4 or Mortal Kombat for that matter, but in most other situations, an article like this would tend to primarily attract people who liked it, not disliked it.  I'm not exactly jumping into the comments section for articles about Insomniac to bring up that I disliked Resistance: Fall of Man.",

My feelings became a lot more mixed. I think I dislike it more than I like it now. \n\nMechanically speaking, it's just a downgrade. Not being able to carry Salts like Eve Hypos makes you reluctant to use Vigors, unlike Plasmids. I played a whole run of BioShock 2 with just the Drill and Plasmids. Can't do that in Infinite unless you want to run around spamming the use key most of the game (which you do anyway since you can't carry Salts or Medkits). 2 gun limit feels restrictive. The random clothing perks feels terrible, Gene Tonics was a better system. Hacking and security systems are gone, replaced with Possession which is an expensive and not-as-useful Vigor to use, made worse by the inability to carry Salts like Hypos. The Big Daddy fights were dynamic and you could set up and expecute a plan to take them down, but the Handyman fights are set pieces more than anything. They just show up exactly when a designer felt like it would be cool to have one there, and you have to engage with it on the designers terms instead of yours, like 1 and 2 (Big Sisters are even more dynamic than Handymen). The story actually starts to break down the more you think about it, and the \"many worlds\" logic doesn't actually make a ton of sense (drowning Booker at the baptism makes no sense for what they're trying to accomplish).\n\nI really could go on but you get the idea. It's one of those games where on a first playthrough you think it's amazing, but then you play it again and the more you think about it the more sour of a taste it leaves in your mouth over time. Is it a complete fucking disaster of a video game? No, it's pretty average. But that's kind of the point. It's an alright video game, but it's not a good BioShock game.\n\nI don't have a vendetta, I just played it.",

The concluding remark is, \"The only difference between Comstock and Fitzroy is how you spell the name.\" As if just because they're both violent means they're both equally wrong.\n\nEDIT: I think this quote from Mark Twain is worth considering when we think of violence during revolutions. \n\n&gt;There were two 'Reigns of Terror,' if we would but remember it and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are all for the 'horrors' of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe, compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heart-break? \n\n&gt;What is swift death by lightning compared with death by slow fire at the stake? A city cemetery could contain the coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror--that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.",

Toward the end of the game, the narrative takes on a ridiculously centrist bait-and-switch position that tries to apply \"bothsides-ism\" to the Vox Populi vs. the Founders conflict solely based on both sides using violence. The game essentially equates an insanely racist/fascist regime to a leftist, anti-fascist rebellion movement in a very borderline \"I'm OK with protesting... but *someone* think of the businesses!!!\" manner. It's *really* bad.\n\n2.) When it becomes clear Levine has no actual idea how to end the story, the last 30 minutes of the game become this completely incoherent \"EnDLesS POssIBiliTIEs\" mess of time-travel and alternate dimension ideas instead of just committing to a single, finalized conclusion. This all also comes out of batshit nowhere, as well.",

Maybe soon more people will realise that the gameplay sucked too and was a major step down to what was advertised and promised, not to mention a noticable downgrade to Bioshock 1 and 2's gameplay, pipe minigame notwithstanding. This is apparently a known issue with Ken Levine's style of direction where he's super ADHD with all of its pros and cons but has poor visual-spatial awareness. \n\nSo, he can come up with a 1,000 great ideas but has to see it fully developed before he can decide whether he actually likes it. This leads to entire levels, mechanics, storylines, and even settings getting put on the cutting room floor, likely wasting years of development. So, the constant dynamic threat of the Songbird is gone; the hubs being more interconnected with the zip lines - which acted as bottlenecks allowing the new area to load - were removed; Elizabeth's ability playing a more involved role in the gameplay - gone; the idea that it was straight up a horror game in the same vein as System Shock 2 and Bioshock, relegated solely to the Asylum, particularly with the Boys of Silence. Instead the game became a two-weapon, first person, arena shooter (the laziest of game designs) with Elizabeth occassionally helping out by warping a chest-high wall into your dimension, but with WASP-American Exceptionalist window dressing, and plenty of illusion-of-choice options to make you feel good about yourself on your first playthrough.\n\n---\nMaybe I don't have to wait too much longer for people to finally realise that 2013 in video games, while a profitable year for the industry, was not a good year for the hobby like is the current consensus, and in fact  was a fucking atrocious year. Now, admittedly, I have a big sore spot for 2013. It was the year I burnt-out on AAA games and never really went back. It's when I stopped trusting games journalism to give accurate review/scores on video games (let alone the culture) and moved over to YouTubers. It was also probably the most toxic era in the industry's history what with those gamergate numbskulls doxxing every woman and every person with a skin colour slightly darker than eggshell and giving them rape and death threats. It was an exhausting time to be on the internet. In saying that:\n\n&gt; **EDIT for added context:** Here a list of games that were released in 2013 - the same year that Bioshock Infinite was released - that, much like Bioshock Infinite, were reviewed, at the time, extremely well by critics and the public alike. The reason I mentioned those games is because I believe they should also receive a reevaluation in the same way Bioshock Infinite has received a reevaluation, and therefore 2013 as a year-in-games-as-a-whole, more than any other, should received a reevaluation. **/EDIT**\n\n* **The Last Of Us** was an extended escort mission much in the same way that Bioshock Infinite was, [it was a poorly-made, falsely advertised game with stability issues, broken AI, and mediocre gameplay.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF0EaH73ee4) However, because Naughty Dog absolutely, without a doubt, aced the characters, and the pacing of the relationship between the leads, it got people believing that the game as a whole was great. It was not. It was a bad game in ways that was [mostly fixed in the much-maligned sequel] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWEkdMF_kwo), that just so happened to push the industry forward in two very specific ways: the way the story was structured, and its industry-leading characters and characterisations.\n\n* **Grand Theft Auto V** was a miserable experience, with miserable characters, a miserable story, and miserable mission design, with a miserable, cynical, mean-spirited sense of humour, and was a major step in the wrong direction. This game was sandwiched between Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption 2 which were both [within a similar league to Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater in regards to immersive gameplay (mostly) within the AAA scene] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWVtZJo-HqI) and both had a story that could be considered a HBO-quality drama in video game form. And let's not forget its online component, which was such a successful cash grab that it fundamentally altered how Take-Two did business, who are now one of the greediest companies in the industry. Meanwhile, Rockstar has only released one new game in the past decade (Red Dead Redemption 2), and Dan Houser has since left the company, possibly the industry.\n\n* **Assassin's Creed: Black Flag** was, despite it's enjoyable sailing mechanics, worse than every Assassin's Creed game that preceded it in just about every conceivable way, with its missions and pacing being particularly woeful. Furthermore, its semi-erasure of the Assassin Order in favour of [insert job here], its minimisation and bastardisation of the narrative in general and the modern day section in particular, it was the beginning of the end for the franchise.\n\n* **Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon** is by far the worst Luigi's Mansion game, and was certainly not worth the wait; and while Luigi's Mansion 3 was far more entertaining, it looks like Nintendo have no intention of recapturing the magic of the first game.\n\n* **Pikmin 3** was vastly inferior to Pikmin 2, with the Flying Pikmin in particular making the Blue Pikmin redundant outside of like 2 collectables.\n\n* **Tomb Raider** was a ludonarrative disaster whose gameplay betrayed the narrative they were trying to tell and likely did more to harm to what came before than added to it, as the developers intended. It started off strong before devolving into mindless slaughter.\n\n* **Gone Home** was a hipster-wank, glorified point-and-click adventure with a shock-ending, artificially popularised from the then rampant nepotism between those in the industry and the video-game journalists whose job it was to supposedly critique and review it. And I say that as someone who is very left-wing and was definitely the intended audience.\n\n---\nOn a positive note, 'Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance' and 'A Link Between Worlds' were good though, and 'Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn' ended up doing more to rejuvenate the brand than any other Final Fantasy game in the past 20 years.",

I don't think you can put it entirely on Ken though since Take Two could have simply found a replacement for him (as would be the case at any studio), or, that they didn't replace Ken sooner (as was Ken's original intention) before sinking more money into a project led by a man clearly struggling.",

The writing of Infinite is arguably its worst part--and thats saying something when everything you mentioned happened and the miserable gameplay loop of the game exists. He definitely has a knack at making cool, iconic worlds but I'd go as far as to say that Bioshock 1's story is probably overhyped. It had a cute twist that carries it in a time where that sort of narrative twist was undervalued in western games, its not bad by any means, but it ain't winning any awards outside of that specific time and place. Outside of the twist, none of the parts of Bioshock that stand out really come from the actual narrative, just the cool setting.\n\nLet him make the setting, then lock him in a windowless room alone until the game ships imo.",

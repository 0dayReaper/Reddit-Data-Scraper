Best hint for that is Johto being the smallest region, smaller than even Kanto, as well as a GOOD chunk of the Gen 2 dex unavailable until reaching Kanto.\n\nThe extra compression actually COST extra space. However it MASSIVELY increased loading speeds down to what people were used to from Gen 1. Because Gen 2 had a bigger capacity cartridge which in return had slower reading speeds.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TruePokemon/comments/hwluk9/while_it_is_true_that_iwata_did_write_a_new/ Source with a LOT of links providing evidence.",

The game didn't sell particularly big numbers at boxed retail, and its launch week sits well behind Zelda, Hogwarts Legacy, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Resident Evil 4 and Dead Island 2. However, as a game that's particularly popular on PC, the vast majority of sales will be via digital download stores. We will receive the digital data later in the week. \n\nDiablo is obvioiusly extremely popular on PC but I thought diablo 3 sold a shit ton on console as well. Strange that d4 is so significantly behind other releases in physical sales especially considering it launched on last gen as well. I guess it's the only hard online only, live service out of the games it's compared to here so maybe more people went digital?",

I played with a a few different  builds on my way to 50 before I decided on more or less what I wanted to do for endgame.... Until I found no sacreds or legendaries that complimented my shadow build so I begrudgingly switched to a bone build -- it took maybe 15 minutes?  I would suggest that you hit up a build guide around lvl 40 though to give yourself a roadmap",

Essentially, once you are far enough into a build, the inertia required to change that build becomes more difficult.\n\nFor instance, the aspect system is great and lets you get many basic (or in some case, all) of the legendary powers you need to get going with a build. However, by manually crafting these aspects, they will always roll minimum (unless from an extracted aspect), so you are encouraged to find \"natural\" drops of these powers with higher rolls, and then craft them onto your items. This is fine and good, but what if you eventually get tired of the build you're playing? You would need new items, with potentially new stats. If you can salvage an item into your new build, that's nice, but what about the legendary power attached to it that you previously spent a long time finding a higher roll for? You would have to replace it if that legendary power doesn't do anything for your new build.\n\nThis issue, I guess, could be mitigated with the stash (which is limited and has a rudimentary sorting system which is frustrating) by saving items that could potentially be good for another build, but there are a lot of stats, and it is unlikely you will know what is good for another build until you are playing that build or are interested in playing it. But, as stated previously, you are monogamously attached, in most cases, to the build you currently are. So, we return to the original problem.",

It's probably a good game based on how it looks and feels and plays for a lot of people, but I'd actually argue it's not really that good. A lot of visual fidelity, but mechanically it's very average and flawed. Depends on whether you want a casual experience or not, I'd say.\n\nWas kinda fun for 30 hours, but I never see myself playing through this campaign again. Endgame is also super lackluster, boring skills, forced builds via itemization, etc.\n\nObviously, this might be fine for a lot of people that just wanna play through it and be done with it, but it's just not what I'm looking for in an ARPG. I want replayability and freedom, D4 is the absolute opposite for me. Granted, I'm not exactly a casual in ARPGs, so keep that in mind. \n\nChances are, if you aren't too hard into the genre, you will enjoy this a lot more than me. Definitely a good entry point in ARPGs.\n\nAlso fuck level scaling. They should've made it optional.",

But I'd say 99% will not reach level 100 given how similar the endgame content to the early game content is and how long it takes.\n\nThe leveling process was atrocious, since I've felt the same power level through the whole campaign and nothing could change this fact. There was nothing I could do to get ahead of this curve, to make boss fights less tedious, etc.\n\nAdd that to the fact that the balancing in the game is so off and you really get ridiculous leveling experiences depending on the class and the items you drop.",

If I do T3 stuff - like playing with low lvl friends - I wreck stuff like I'm playing a PoE build, and if I want a challenge I can push T4 dungeon tiers.\n\nAt the beginning of the game I got wrecked every time The Butcher was in my dungeons, and at the end of the campaign I didn't even need potions anymore to kill him. Same improvements for literally every other metric like dungeon clear speed, event clear speed and so on. \n\nSo when people say the scaling stops them from feeling powerful I wonder what weird builds they must be playing.

The only caveat is that they need to make at least some sense and have some synergy between skills, passives and gear.\n\nMy most recent character I leveled was a barb, and I played a full thorns build up until about level 40 where I swapped to whirlwind because I was bored of playing thorns. Making this build worked meant picking the right talents for it, gemming my gear for thorns, enchanting gear that had thorns potential for a chance at more thorns, and looking at what synergies I had available.\n\nYeah, into the real endgame you can't play dumb stuff quite as effectively, but you still don't need to stick to absolute meta, just more \"normal\" stuff, but that is to be expected.",

You are literally getting weaker.\n\nIf you feel that you're getting weaker after leveling up, it means that your build is terrible and you need to take another look at it.\n\nI've leveled 4 characters to at least 50 at this point, with my main being close to 70, and I only ever felt this on my druid (first character) when I had no idea how to build properly.\n\nMy most recent character was leveled almost exclusively through spamming the same two dungeons, and the difficulty consistently got lower as I leveled up, gradually increasing how many mobs I could include in one pull and getting to the point where I was literally immortal regardless of pull size as long as I didn't afk around level 35 or so, which kept up all the way to 46 when I did the capstone dungeon.\n\n\nThe general rule to keep in mind is that scaling is based off how powerful an \"average\" character is expected to be. If your build and gear are bang on overage, difficulty will stay consistent. Leveling gives you more options with each level, increasing the potential disparity between the best and worst builds, so anything below average will struggle more, and anything above average will be even more powerful.",

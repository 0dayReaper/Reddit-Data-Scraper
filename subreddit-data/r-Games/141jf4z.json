The first game's story was fine if it was your first exposure, but such a significant part of Remake (especially the ending) only really hits if you're familiar with the original. Everything with the ghosts is entirely based around this meta theme about the game being a remake. Personally, I loved all of those things in Remake, but definitely think it made the story less accessible for new players.",

Total newcomers enjoyed the game the most.\n\nThis really tracks with what I've seen online.  The only part people were neutral to negative on was the ending.  A veteran would be much more likely to pick apart the ending.\n\nI don't think players need to one hundred percent understand the story as it's unfolding to get full enjoyment.  The mystery element is fun.",

The game is perfectly stand alone as a newcomer, but old fans are way more likely to have issues with any small changes, let alone big ones.\n\nIt's kind of like with adaptations, where I'd bet they are usually better rated among people who didn't read the book. Especially for very popular franchises like HP or LOTR.",

Changes happen, that's natural, and of course if you're going to expand upon the story in such a significant way, changes have to be made\n\nI really enjoyed the remake for the most part, at least presentation and gameplay-wise. The story changes are incredibly messy, but once I came to the understanding that this was some sequel thing, I just said meh. The story will probably be incredibly dumb but as long as they give me good gameplay still then I'm along for the ride\n\nI do wonder how I'd feel had I never played the original, though",

The mystery of Sephiroth, the ancients and Jenova. Some of it gets explained a lot but not Jenova's origins and I still see people argue about plot points of the original to this day lol. The game creators were inspired by The Thing which never explains where The Thing came from either which is part of why that movie is so great too. Or the Xenomorphs and Engineers  from Alien before the new movies. Japan also LOVES Twin Peaks, its Kitase's favourite show even. \n\nThere were probably a lot of people especially kids who didnt understand what was going on fully in FF7 when it came out and enoyed it. \n\nAnd this arguement is entirely omitting the fact it's a videogame and part of the enjoyment comes from gameplay too. Maybe fully understand is a better thing to say? But you don't need to fully understand something to enjoy it.",

There are secrets and mysteries in games done well where someone can figure it out themselves, the gold chocobo breeding system was *not* one of them. The obtuse and 100% unexplained shit like that was to sell the strategy guides. There isn't any more mystery to flipping through a guide book or having other people that did tell you than the game itself telling you.\n\nLike the chest in ff12 you are NOT supposed to open when you find it, with nothing indicating as such anywhere ingame and conveniently only brought up in the strategy guide. Nobody just \"finds\" that stuff out for themselves.",

Because for me, this feels JUST like that kind of tension and anticipation. \n\nAnyway... \n\nIt'd be super weird for sure! I cannot wait to see how they ultimately manage the transition(s). I had high hopes for Remake, but few expectations, and despite the variances I found it highly enjoyable. Indeed, I was thrilled to visit and explore such a vibrant, more personal, Sector 7. It was an unexpected synthesis of both nostalgia and new experiences. I wouldn't be surprised if SE (much like in '97) alters fundamentally the way we engage as (us) the consumers and (them) the manufacturer. \n\nFull disclosure: I'm a total Square fan boy (I played Final Fantasy -- in 1988 -- and have been hooked since). It's frankly shameful how much I have emotionally invested in this! I can't even imagine the pressure they all must be under -- it must at times feel as if the world itself is scrutinizing every detail of every release ad nauseam.\n\nBut (much like my bartender) I trust SE to deliver something grand and compelling, something I want again and again, an experience worth sharing. I'm now far more open to story changes, if they can tell me a story as compelling as Original's. And I believe they can. For me, the mystery quality today is magnitudes greater than in '97, and I am so excited for what next gets delivered!",

It's all CGI by definition (unless we're going back to those weird live action games from the CDI era and MK), and why I wish they'd be clearer with 'pre-rendered' if they're using it.  I do think that Greenberg is trying to imply that things will be either real game play, non-pre-rendered in engine, or pre-rendered cutscenes, but I really don't know if that's true or not.",

Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind as a notorious example of this, where it tried to play fast and loose with in-engine videos.",

Then I can surround it with a 500GB of nanite forest and render it frame by frame with insane detail even though no computer under $2500 will be able to run it lol.\n\nThere's a guy on the Unreal sub today showing off a pretty insane looking game but he's using a 4090 and normal hardware of this generation (3000 series or under) aren't going to be running it at anything over 20fps. Looks awesome and it's exciting to see what games will look like when that hardware becomes the norm, but it's not looking like that on launch lol\n\nThey really need to say \"Real time\" vs \"Pre-Rendered\" along with the GPU/console.\n\nAnd even still, you have games like the original Destiny that packs unique animations and features into the intro level just for the trailer... or games like No Man's Sky where the lead dev pretended to play a CGI movie of a game that doesn't exist, even pretending to use the controller in his hands, just days before the game released. Some studios will just lie lol. ^((I don't care that he finished the game later, NMS fans, I'm talking about the pre-launch lies specifically.))",

Games running on high end PCs etc...\n\nHopefully the next step is release dates and shipping games because its mental to me we are still waiting for games they announced in 2019/2020.\n\nIts the least sexy option but I hope they limit themselves to games releasing by holiday 2024 and they actually announce launch windows.   Resist the temptation to tease some bollocks that will probably be a cross gen launch title for the next Xbox at this rate.    Its far past time Xbox started to deliver in the here and now.\n\nI would just note that Hellblade 2 was \"real time\" when it was shown in 2019 and we are still waiting on it.  So I do need release windows.\n\nI think the lukewarm reception to the Sony showcase and previous Xbox showcases has given Xbox a open goal for this particular show.  I just hope its a show about delivering on promises and not just the same old song and dance we get from them every June.",

It won't be enough to change the Xbox narrative of no games (still have to deliver them) but it'll help.\n\nThey also should get big third party reveals and marketing rights like GTA6, Dragon Age Dreadwolf and such IMO.

It just means the video shown had its visuals created within the game engine itself, but crucially it\u2019s not mentioning how long each frame took (and thus often means higher settings, supercomputers, graphics features that won\u2019t be in the actual game, etc).",

You can go look up the metacritic/steam scores for each of those games, all are high meaning that a lot of people (critic and players) liked and play those games. \n\nagain, you might not like any of those games but that's irrelevant to the discussion. Whether you like the games or not doesn't change the metacritic scores. Heck, MS won that Metacritic \"best publisher\" award in 2021: https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-was-metacritics-highest-rated-publisher-in-2021-with-the-largest-average-score-ever/\n\nSo blindly calling MS's output as \"massive disappointment\" because of 2 games and ignoringthe 13 others (and I might've missed some) is really... ya :/ \n\nEDIT - why are people replying back saying they don't like the list of games? I already said that literally has nothing to do with the point I'm making -_-\n\nnow you can more definitively say their **output** is a disappointment in terms of the number of games being released, sure you can make that argument against MS and I would agree with that.",

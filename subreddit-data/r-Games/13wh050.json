    "postText": "&gt;\"Metal Gear Solid 2\" would proceed at a smooth pace up until its launch in November of 2001. At that\ntime, I was also engaged in promotional-related activities for the game. The depiction of game's\nthemes and its numerous similarities with the real-world events on September 11 rendered it unfit\nfor release at the time. After consulting with lawyers, the end result was that the game\nrequired revisions in 300 spots. It goes without saying that we were crisis mode and it was\nthreatening the release and sale of the game.\n\n&gt;I was called in to speak with the board of directors and after explaining the story details everyone's\nfacial expression had a look of \u201cThis is not good.\" Since the plan for the game was to have a worldwide\nrelease the idea of shelving the project altogether would have a tremendous impact in terms of business.\n\n&gt;I thought to myself, \"The game shouldn't be released at this period in time. I have no other choice but to\ntake responsibility and resign from the company.\" | then reached out to Kagemasa K\u014dzuki the founder of\nKonami through email. He responded with, \u201cI have made up my mind. The game should be released. What are\nyour thoughts?\" I was moved by the words and I too made up my mind. I also had discussions with Ken\nKutaragi the then president of Sony Computer Entertain- ment (SCEI). Mr. Kutaragi heard my explanation and\noffered his advice stating, \u201cThis is not a matter you should be ashamed of. You should go ahead and\nrelease the game.\" If I didn't have the support of these two individuals, I can't predict how the events\nwould've transpired otherwise. The places in the game that necessitated revisions were corrected and the game's release was postponed by a\nfew weeks. In the end, the game would go on to receive worldwide critical acclaim with impunity. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/MGSMGN/status/1663337502168711168",

            "comment": "He also talked about this in the ign interview from december last year:\n\nIGN: Was Mr Kozuki's presence a major factor for you, then?\n\nKojima: I even have Mr. Kozuki to thank for me being able to create here at Kojima Productions. 9/11 took place in 2001 right before the release of Metal Gear Solid 2. We'd just sent off the master, but the game featured both the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. It seemed impossible to release the game. I was called to the board of directors and they all turned pale when I explained the situation. Nobody would tell me what to do, with the exception of Mr. Kozuki, who tackled the issue.\n\nAs I thought about what to do, I went to speak with Mr. Kozuki about possibly quitting the company. That's when he told me: 'When this game comes out and society has their say about it, they'll be talking about you, its creator, and me, the person who sold it. I doubt they'll say anything about anyone else. What will you do? I'm ready for whatever happens.'\n\nWhen I heard how far he was willing to go, I made the firm decision that we'd release it together. The rest is history.\n\nI become completely exhausted, and I always end up in an awful state when I finish making a game. After the first Metal Gear Solid, even after it was done I wasn't recovering at all and ended up being passed from one hospital to the next. Mr. Kozuki was the only one who worried about me then. Looking back, I feel like he showed more concern for me than anyone whenever I was having trouble.\n\n[https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-interview-new-studio-phase-2](https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-interview-new-studio-phase-2)",

Your right I think in that people generally don\u2019t treat everyone like assholes. The problem is, there\u2019s enough news outlining the facts that many CEOs treat only other very powerful people with any sense of humanity. But to everyone else, even people that work for them to enable their salary, these human lives are little more than numbers on a spreadsheet that need to be managed in order to enjoy the next payout. \n\nStrength in character and doing the right thing tend to be things I see valued in companies only on the surface. Their actions tend to contradict these values, if at any point these values would slow down profits from their theoretical best. Everything feels like this game in corporate culture (at least in my admittedly fairly limited years so far in my software engineering career). \n\nThat\u2019s why the founder\u2019s reply felt meaningful to me, because while you are right that it\u2019s not that CEOs are comic book villains that are mean for the sake of it, but because so much news today demonstrates that any charisma in their leadership tends to be a means to an end, not from their genuine humanity. Hell, Bobby Kotick just did an interview with a magazine and said that the sexual allegations against Blizzard were part of the culture war-fake news media. A woman killed herself and the her boss literally wiped her phone. The same boss that spread her nudes at the Christmas party. It\u2019s so hard to ever see CEOs as people when they do things like this (or at least protect it). The man threatened to have his attendant killed and is all over Epstiens book. \n\nHaving said all that, kinda surprised you got so crucified with the downvotes, I get that your point could be seen as sympathetic to CEOs which is clearly a nono on Reddit, but I think remembering that people are rational actors is the core of your point that I think a lot of people missed.",

I'm sure both are true to some degree depending on the person. But regardless, I bet stories like the one people are talking about here aren't all that odd.

I\u2019m saying that this is more likely due to reasons that all studios that grapple with internally. Most final products are a hodgepodge of dependencies and ultra specific software versions that make it difficult to just magic up old builds of games and get them running on modern systems.

If you [trace a line from Castle Clinton south to Liberty Island](https://imgur.com/2lmdVeP), you don\u2019t go out to sea at all \u2014 you end up further west, in the seaport that straddles Bayonne and Jersey City (and specifically the old military port, which has [the _worst_ 9/11 memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Struggle_Against_World_Terrorism), a gift from Russia). That said, if you consider AG as coming in on [a curve that tracks over both Liberty and Ellis Islands before passing Castle Clinton](https://imgur.com/EcVyJaw), that does go out to sea.",

It basically predicted the entire modern Internet culture, and that society would become essentially ungovernable when people can easily access and generate information to fit any conceivable narrative they can come up with. \n\n\\*Edit: I accidentally replied to a deleted comment, which I'm pretty sure makes my reply invisible, but I put way too much thought and effort for it to not be readable, so here goes:\n\nI don't think the Patriots really made much of a distinction between what information was true or false, just that it was overabundant and conflicting, and that it's human nature to seek out only viewpoints we agree with. They were basically trying to enforce an objective reality in a time where reality was becoming more and more subjective. Of course, the way they went about it was wrong, since no one organization or government should get to be the arbiter of truth. Either you have a single entity that decides the \"truth\", or you let people pick and choose what is \"true\", even if it leads to completely insane or dangerous beliefs flourishing unchallenged. There's no in-between. \r  \n\r  \nIn truth, it's a problem without a solution, and the end cutscenes show Raiden coping with that. Reality will continue to grow more subjective, and any rock-solid foundation we think we stand on could turn out to be water at any minute. \r  \n\r  \nRaiden struggles with the idea of living in a world where nothing is definitively \"true\", until Snake gives his legendary speech about having faith. Snake argues that even if nothing can objectively proven to be \"real\", we can still place faith in certain things find our own \"real enough.\" And if we can't fully know the past, then the future can't fully know the present, so does that make everything pointless if it's doomed to be forgotten or misremembered? Again, Snake says no, what we believe in has meaning to \\*us\\*, and nothing can take that away. Furthermore, we can share our beliefs and our \"real enough\" realities with future generations via what we do and make with our time on Earth. Because in the end, it's what we do with the world and time we're given that makes us human.",

MGS2 is one giant love letter to Jean Baudrillard, the philosopher Kojima spent the 90s reading; all of its themes, concepts and predictions are in Baudrillard's writing (and even bits of its dialogue), and were already being discussed and debated. He wasn't expressing prophetic visions, he was applying existing ideas in interesting way to the story and worldbuilding of his games. (Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker even contains a French character who brags about being a countryman of Baudrillard.)\n\nCheck out two of his books if you like Metal Gear, you'll see so much of its DNA in there. [The Gulf War Did Not Take Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gulf_War_Did_Not_Take_Place), about how societies/groups define war and attach moral and personal values to the concept of it to legitimize things, and [Simulacra and Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation), about our tendency to create simulations of things and experiences, transforming or forgetting the originals in the process, and eventually assign further meanings to the simulation until it becomes in some way more than the original and itself gets simulated.

Whenever somebody asks me whether games can be art, I point to this game.\n\nAnd funnily enough, it\u2019s not even the best MGS game.\n\nJust the amount of brave unpopular decisions that were taken in its direction would be enough to consider it one of the greatest, but Kojoma explores so many themes that would become important in the next few years:\n\n-\teverybody knows the spiel about information bubbles and \u201cthe world being engulfed in truth\u201d by now, but you could argue that Patriot AI is similar concept to what modern algorithmically-driven internet is - it doesn\u2019t censor content, but it creates context\n-\tVR training and Solid Snake Simulation plan to create a perfect soldier arguably predicts the rise of modern military shooter\n-\twhole plot of the game retreading and deconstructing MGS1 plot-points being quite brave rejection of appeasing player expectations of a sequel\n-\tRaiden as a deconstruction of the player themselves, who after playing MGS1 idolizes Snake and want to be like him; not sure if on purpose but also playing with the misogyny and homophobia of gamer crowd\n\nI still can\u2019t believe that Kojima somehow convinced Konami to make this game the way it is. It truly is a postmodern masterpiece that gets even better as it ages.\n\nI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll ever get anything close to that from AAA developers - just look what happened with NaughtyDog after they had a similar idea of rejecting player expectations in TLoU2.",

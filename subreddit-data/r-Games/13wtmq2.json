But for those that for some reason still don't have Hollow Knight and Rain World, those two alone are already more than worth the price of admission. \n\nBloodstained and Blasphemous are also quite good.",

            "comment": "Rain World isn't a metroidvania. It's an open-world game. The world is not ability gated. You start with every ability that you finish with and you can go wherever you want right from the get go, even the final area. It's 2D with a big winding map so it gets lumped in the category all the time.\n\nThat said, it's an incredible game. I'd class it as one of the best games ever made. Most people will bounce off it, and I'm completely fine with that. If this bundle can get a few more into it then great!",

These are still technically \"powerups\" - not traditional, in-game powerups like a typical Metroidvania, but a \"knowledge powerup\" that extends past the confines of the game and into your brain. These powerups are then used to get to places you couldn't reach before - they facilitate discovery and exploration of new regions. Isn't that the essence of a Metroidvania?",

It's just as rewarding as finally getting to access a new area because you got the double jump, with the added benefit that you discovered and taught the thing to yourself, as opposed to collecting a double jump token that now allows your player character to jump twice.",

No.  Movement? No.  Level design?  No.  Enemy design? No.  Survival mechanics? No.  It's a mildly original mashup of genres, I'll give it that.  But that's about all ill give it.

It might not convince you, but it's still a very insightful look into the design of the game.\n\nThat being said, I also agree that the game excels at all the things you mentioned. \n\nCombat is mechanically very simple, yes, but in combination with the stellar movement mechanics\u2014which do indeed have a steep learning curve\u2014there is **a lot** that you can do. Especially seeing as all animation is generated procedurally. \n\nLevel design is also extremely well done, and if I remember correctly, it was done by someone who is well-versed in music theory and music production, which you can absolutely see in the design (and I recommend [yet another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bPjuT1xMkg) here).\n\nEnemy design is great. All the enemies are distinct, they all have their distinct yet characteristic behavior that you can slowly piece together if you just interact with or observe them, and as mentioned in the first video I linked, there's a lot of very clever ways to make the enemies feel alive.\n\nJust to be clear, it's fine if you dislike the game, I'm not taking that away from you. I think almost every fan of Rain World will agree that it ain't a game for everyone; it goes against a lot of the modern tropes of making games accessible to nearly everyone, and much like the Dark Souls series, it kinda gives you squat in terms of the story and lore unless you actually pay attention. But it is a gem that's worth exploring and an experience worth having, I think.",

I think it's one of the few 2D games to rival Mario 64 in movement.  \n\n&gt;Enemy Design?  \n\nThe game lives off of the interaction dynamics from the different enemy types.  \nAs example, did you know that demasking the flying enemies will cause others to attack it instead?  \nEach enemy has its own type of instinct which will lead in sudden situations where you may survive because something else swooped in to kill your killer.  \nYou learn to utilize this and actually use enemies to your advantage.  \n\nI can see how the game may not appear to be as deep, but i find the game easily rivals games like Breath of the Wild in terms of emergent gameplay",

IMO I don't love a good metroidvania *because* its gated, I enjoy them for their exploration anyways.",

I think the only bad thing I could say about the game is a relative lack of fast travel points when even without being compared to checkpoint... points, but the devs recently converted some of said checkpoint points into full on fast travel points and even added some more across the map so it's not as annoying as it was on release. Other than that it's a solid 9/10 metroidvania, definitely the sleeper hit of the bundle.",

It takes a heavy focus on consumable items which may seem familiar to some people if you've played any sort of Mystery Dungeon game before. Picking up a bundle of Earth Wands with 5 charges and figuring out good opportunities to use them. The environment has a ton of effects that can be applied to it giving it a (**VERY**) light Noita vibe. Health and mana pools are severely limited in an effort to push you to use those consumables, but it can also feel **very** unforgiving at times because of this. The overall idea of it is a bit hindered by the basic menuing system which isn't awful per se, but does nothing to help you contend with the amount of items you'll be collecting.\n\nAnd honestly, yeah, it's horny bait. You could tell that from the trailer, but the item you get for beating I think the first boss is a pair of striped panties \"decorated with yellow stains\" as per the, uh, flavor text (gag).\n\nAll that said, I think the ideas are solid, the controls feel pretty good for the most part, and the pixel artwork is sufficiently crunchy.",

I don't know if I'd put it above it, but having played plenty of metroidvanias I've come across more I could say almost definitively is above SotN like say, Astalon or Ori or AM2R (or La Mulana, but that's personal preference and less of a metroidvania than it is a Maze of Galleous-like so I have a hard time counting it here). That's not an insult against SotN but it's a game that defined a genre over **twenty five years** ago; it's not really going to have a lot of up-to-date things and plenty of things have innovated on it better. But to me, Bloodstained just feels like modern SotN.",

Lots of secrets and hidden things if you're into it, but most are very optional. The combat is really fun, and once you get the hang of it you feel really powerful, but the platforming can be a little trying at times.

Most of the knowledge you need in rain world is figuring out how to survive various enemies, and just figuring out what the goal even is. It isn't really that you get blocked by something you don't understand yet, learn more elsewhere, and then come back and figure it out.\n\nRainworld is unforgiving and unfair, and the game is really about learning how to deal with that fact.",

It's extremely tough and unforgiving, and downright unfair at points but it definitely makes you feel like a prey animal. It's a tough sell, but it is worth getting into. That said, if you're someone who needs relatively steady progress you probably won't like it as you might get stuck somewhere for a long time before figuring out how to get out / progress.",

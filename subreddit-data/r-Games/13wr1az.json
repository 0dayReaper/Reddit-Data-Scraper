Murder on Eridanos is pretty standalone but, I feel it benefits from being familiar with the faction of Sublight Salvage (which means playing it during or right after Monarch). Peril on Gorgon is tied into the story of Edgewater and thus the story of Parvati (the first town and companion). When I went back to play them for the first time I played MoE right after Monarch and PoG near the end of Byzantium and have been satisfied with that pacing. The end of the game doesn\u2019t change based off of the DLC so it\u2019s not the end of the world to knock \u2018em out without replaying everything and instead power through them.",

I know it might diminish the magic a little, but I would love a sequel, seeing those planets in the after credits scene made me want more. I loved echoes of the eye but I would love a new solar system.",

Coop soulslike 3rd person shooter!   Linear(ish) levels and lots of awesome gear to find and unlock",

It's a legit 3rd person shooter/sort of melee Soulslike (I'm not just saying that, it's legitimately a Soulslike).\n\nI played the shit out of the first. A big thing with the game is some procedural generation alongside your first playthrough won't encounter every boss.\n\nThe game promotes replayability across NG+ and has a lot of the mechanics you'd expect from games like Dark Souls (gather XP points, you die you lose them, Bonfires, reaction time centric combat).",

Also interested in Cart Life. Though I have a tendency to start those slice of life games but not see them through.",

Just one of those weird 'it was in the Ether' kinds of moments I guess. They've ended up looking very different, which is cool. I've often joked that you could give 10 devs the same prompt and 3 years later you'd have 10 totally different games :).",

I was already in that situation when the game originally came out, so it immediately stressed me out.\n\nWhen it re-releases, I might come back to it with a guide because there are a lot of (probably very intentional) pitfalls you can run into.",

MFL looks more fun and goofy, whereas Gadgets looks like I'm not smart enough to play but would enjoy clips of what people made.\n\nViewfinder looks great and the antichamber shoutout is huge for me, I loved that game.\n\nCocoon looks good.. but I'm not sure how much interplay/puzzle solving there is with the different worlds.  It kind of looked like you just move to a different level and carry around a ball.  I'd have hoped there was something more, like carrying around a smaller level to a new place unlocks changes within it or something.  I came away unsure if there are intricate puzzles or a facade of complexity",

I work in film and I was kind of blown away by their production and ideas of how they presented themselves. they also switched film genres throughout their presentation which only added to the surreal vibe.",

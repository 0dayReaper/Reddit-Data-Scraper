Story-wise, it's pretty significant, and as a game it really doesn't hold up. Lots of backtracking over pretty big areas, AND respawning enemies, means a massive drain on resources. To the point that a lot of people were softlocked on a certain boss fight in an airplane because managing health and ammo items was so difficult.\n\nMost importantly, isn't it time to introduce a new generation of gamers to Steve? Haven't they been deprived long enough??",

Would be cool to see that incorporated into the narrative of a remake.  \n\nIt *also* sort of explains why Chris is jacked in RE5, cuz he gets wrecked by Wesker in RE5. And lastly, the T-Veronica virus is one of the samples he collects (Along with T, G, and Las Plagas and the Progenitor virus) to create Urobouros.  So I think it definitely furthers the storyline in several ways.",

Heck you could boil that last one down to just being a G infected plagas and I'd buy it.\n\nI don't think we really need Wesker's report either. It's some nice exposition, but it's pretty easy to infer most of it from the events of the main games.",

Idk why people think Capcom is all of a sudden going to start taking it seriously now, at least with regards to their decisions about what game comes next.\n\nI have high confidence that a CV remake will happen eventually, RE is more popular than ever and the Remakes are a relatively consistent money printer for Capcom, but I guarantee you that the sticking to the chronology of the series won\u2019t factor *at all* into how and when Capcom decides to do it.",

There is a character-switching mechanic in there, where you do not have access to any weapons or healing items the other character has in their inventory, and the switching happens without any warning. Good luck beating the final boss without any decent weapons.\n  \nYou basically just have to know when it's about to happen so that you can put the weapons in the item box right before the switch. You might realize to immediately reload a save when you go past that point, but most gamers are probably thinking that it's not going to fuck you like that so close to the end, but it does.",

Gameplay is almost exactly the same, its more action packed but its not like RE4 was really scary at any point of its existence. And replaying it recently with my brother was an absolute blast that game fuckin slaps and looks fantastic still.\n\nI wlil say 6 needs a remake bad though because we got so bored so fast in that one.",

Launching as an exclusive on the failing Dreamcast was a sales disaster then quickly making a port for the Playstation 2. \n\nIt was also a game of experimentation, where 3D rendering instead of prerendered backgrounds were used for the first time in an RE game and a camera that followed the player's movement was used but was still uncontrollable. \n\nFor some reason the knife was incredibly strong, allowing you to AOE zombies without fear of getting hit and using ammo, taking away much of the challenge against the common basic enemy.\n\nThe dialog is also as campy as ever, but Steve Burnside is on another level of annoying.",

Remaking a game that was already damn good like RE4 is fine and all, but it's the games that had loads of potential but fell short of hitting the mark like RECV that really need the remake treatment. There are some great ideas in CV buried beneath frustrating gameplay and cringeworthy cutscenes. I just played it last year so it's pretty fresh in my mind.",

It's a harmless and fun event which doesn't affect anyone who doesn't watch in the slightest - the trailers show up on YouTube pretty immediately. \n\nGood for him, I say.",

I do think that some form of event like E3 still have its place and need to exist in some form or another.\n\nThis is an era of indie gaming and event like this does wonder for Indie gems discovery. Not every game is gonna become the next Stardew Valley. And while I do agree that too much of that make the event feel lame as hell (Sorry, Sony) I think not having it at all will make me missed it entirely. \n\nAnd I think that in the end, it simply just does more harm than good for dev team that doesn't have marketing power like big corporate one.",

So you'd think those would try to \"compete\" and show their best. \n\nBut they often don't really do it. At best you get a few exciting things but not a full great show",

I don't see how that invalidates what you replied to.\n\nThe comment they replied to said \"decade ago\", 5 years ago is not a decade.\n\nAlso, 2018's E3 was the third last E3 in history. 2020, 2022 and 2023 were all canceled and 2021 was online-only, limited in scope. If we talk about E3 events, 2018 was one of the most recent ones.\n\nYes, many of the old E3's were better, but even the last few ones were cool (maybe besides 2021 for obvious reasons). Unlike many people here, I appreciate what Keighley is trying to do, but SGF is still far off in terms of production value and attendance from even the below-average E3's.",

Sure, it's not ideal, but a lot of the hate this guy gets is borderline irrational, just nonsense being thrown around by people who have no idea how difficult it must be to organize something like this - getting a ton of publishers, developers, even \"creators\" to sign up for something where *their* brand or *their* product isn't the main thing, but part of something larger, something that's a big plus for both fans and the industry at large. \n\nE3 could suck ass (and a lot of the time, it did), but I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it. If Keighley wants to try and bring it back, more power to him. This is all just... fun, ya know? It costs you, the average viewer, nothing. If you're not into it, just don't tune in.",

I see that before stating a negative opinion, you have more civil discussion if you say first that you absolutely loved movie/game even if you have mixed feelings about it. \n\nAlso for some reason manga discussions are more accepting of criticism you say it's trash and reply will be \"I know, still love it\" :D",

He's got his own showcase which is totally fine (last one sucked, though), but going from tweets alone he's really just swimming in the wake of other publishers/platforms' events and giving the impression that he helped deliver them.\n\nWhat he's doing is entirely different from what IGN, for example, does with their showcase coverage.",

The partnerships helped with keeping the publishers together, but it seems that they're now converging to the same period regardless.\n\nAnd while I feel that Geoff is obviously trying to connect the whole period with his show, isn't that exactly what E3 was doing? If I'm not mistaken, some shows were already technically not from E3 for years. I don't see why that'd be prejudicial for the consumer at all.",

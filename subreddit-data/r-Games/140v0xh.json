    "postText": "Hey, my name's Nate, and I'm releasing the first part of my visual novel [on Steam this Friday](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443110/South_Scrimshaw_Part_One/). It is for people who like weird visual novels.\n\nSouth Scrimshaw uses the linear VN format to create a science fiction documentary about fictional science. It's got over 400 illustrations, painted in a mix of watercolor, ink, and digital media, plus full audio.\n\nIt's a niche type of work, but if you're into biology, illustration, or weird outsider art projects, then you may be one of the readers it resonates with.\n\n[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2443110/South_Scrimshaw_Part_One/)\n[My Twitter](https://twitter.com/n_o_marsh)\n[Itch.io](https://nomarsh.itch.io/scrimshaw) if you'd like to see the current build right now. I'm going to update this build simultaneous with the Steam release.\n\nThanks!",

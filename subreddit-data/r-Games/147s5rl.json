It even had a neat side-game attached to it, I was a fan of going RDA since they had better weapon and armor progression compared to the Na'vi. Plus, the game tends to lean a bit more into the realistic side of what happens when a lone Na'vi, player or otherwise, has to charge an RDA position with multiple soldiers wielding fully automatic weapons, semi-automatic grenade launchers, and even shotguns: you have to use a lot more of those revives to avoid eating a reload screen than you would aligned with the RDA.",

Environments, level design, special effects, camera work, enemy encounters, combat mechanics, etc. all can be tailored to get the most out of the perspective. Switching to the other just isn't really viable in that case.\n\nI'm glad it's first person and it heavily increases the chance I give the game a try. Feels like at least 90% of open world games for the past decade are third person, many of them to sell cosmetic microtransactions. First person, done properly, just hits differently in terms of immersion and feeling of character control.",

Dialogue in Horizon really only extends to optional elaboration and information. Most games with a custom character and dialogue options gives the player character way fewer lines so they feel like they're barely taking part in the conversation. Strangely, Far Cry 6 got rid of the silent protagonist from 5 but Dani is still pretty shy on dialogue, I think. But I definitely feel like Ubisoft in general is really bad with the mission giver monologuing. Watch Dogs Legion was one of the worsts with it. It's even more annoying how many of their cutscenes never set up what the player should be doing and they leave it up to the dialogue once you're back in the game. Likely so the level designers and such can still make whatever they want and keep adjusting while the cutscenes keep things vague. Makes things feel less cohesive.",

Not wanting that style of game for AC is understandable, but to pretend \"enemies have higher levels than you sometimes\" is a gaming sin is kind of what I'm talking about here. It's little bit hyperbolic.\n\nI've also never found the rate at which you level up to make me consider paying to level up, I didn't even know it was an option tbh.",

But somehow, when it comes to Ubisoft, many like to leave a stinky shit in the comment before doing so.\n\nIt's just really funny how Ubisoft kind of created this whole open world checkpoint collector gameplay, and EVERYONE used to say how it was so cringe and generic and bad, but then Zelda copied it, Dark Souls copied it, and literally everyone gets praise for doing it except for Ubisoft. I'm not gonna say these ubisoft games are as good, I just find it funny when people specifically attack the formula like there isn't a reason people are copying it.\n\nI'm pretty sure if you polled the Dark Souls fanbase prior to Elden Ring it would be like 90% that open world games are cringe.",

Both Elden Ring and Zelda leave the map UI mostly bare so you actually have to look around a little to find the next thing. They both make their side content (the mini dungeons and the shrines) kinda pull you away from the open world so that you feel a bit more like you're \\*in\\* something so you aren't just hoovering up bandit camps like a vacuum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd even with all that they still get hit with the same kinds of criticisms that Ubisoft games do, that is that they're bloated and that the side content gets repetitive.",

A few gentle nudges, like \u201cHey, if you specifically wanna progress the story, go to one of these places\u201d, but other than that, there was no hand-holding, no cluttered HUD (In Ghost of Tsushima and the last two Zelda games you can remove the HUD entirely), just a few good mechanics and the freedom to explore.\n\nMeanwhile Ubisoft will give you a million map markers and objective arrows doing the exact opposite. You can even get maps telling you where all the secrets are. The issue is there\u2019s no sense of adventure when your game just becomes a checklist. People want to feel like a hero when they play games, not a pencil pusher.\n\nBeing open world isn\u2019t a problem. Being _Ubisoft_ open world, well, it\u2019s like having a burger vs a steak.

Everything feels focus-grouped to death. Bland open world, bland itemization, bland story, bland RPG mechanics, bland gameplay (just kill countless enemies in one hit, then the bosses (if there are any) are just bullet-sponges), way too much bland content.\n\nI feel like they need to hire some big-time creative minds and storytellers to come in and really empower them to straight up RUN a project. Make deep RPG mechanics, character creators, skill-trees with vastly different gameplay, complex enemies with strengths and weaknesses and attack patterns that you have to adapt to, diverse itemization and treasure, rewarding exploration, or unique mechanics like building, physics, destructible environments. Stories with branching paths that let you make consequential decisions (seems like there might be an aspect of that in Outlaws). Put fun, addictive, responsive or tactical gameplay FIRST, always, and then build the rest of the game around it.\n\nNintendo, CDPR, Sony, Obsidian, Bioware, Xbox, Larian, Avalanche, Bethesda, even Blizzard to some extent, say what you want about any of them but they are all trying to innovate and go outside their comfort zone. Ubisoft isn't. You can't just make the same games for 2 decades and ask why no one likes your games anymore.\n\nThat being said, Avatar and SW Outlaws could be those games. Or they could be Far Cry and Assassin's Creed in a different setting.",

Their games often feel clunky to play and lacking in atmosphere and production value, with generally subpar writing.

That jump upgrade thing shown off right after the skill tree definitely has potential. A fluid and upgradeable parkour system would definitely be a huge improvement to the formula.

Take that aesthetic, add in a coming of age/learning the ways of the tribe and some heavy pro-environmental story and set pieces showing the horror of resource exploitation and you have a pretty authentic Avatar experience.\n\nI think of it sort of like how people loved the latest Harry Potter game, they weren't in it much for expansive lore (HP lore is filled with nonsensical stuff), plot (its pretty basic and has plenty of plot holes) or the characters (its set in a different time period with almost no recurring characters) but it was perfect because it let them feel like they were in the world of Harry Potter. If the Avatar game can do that then it will do great.",

I like not having my character take up a third of the screen. I like having balanced situational awareness and peripheral vision from left to right. I like the extra immersion and proper sense of scale.",

If the islands are just a separate instance though, and you die if you fall off the islands, ehhh.",

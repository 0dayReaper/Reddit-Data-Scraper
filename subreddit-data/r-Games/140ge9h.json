I recently soft-launched the alpha of my platform fighter Counterpick Labs and I'm excited to share it with you all. You can play it for free, right now, directly in your browser!\r  \n\r\r\r  \nKey points:\r\n\n* **Browser-based** and **free to play.**\r\n* Peer-to-peer [**rollback netcode**](https://www.gameshub.com/news/news/rollback-netcode-for-fighting-games-what-is-it-26176/) for smooth online matches.\r\n* The key gameplay twist is **modular character customization**. Instead of picking a single character like you would in most fighting games, you build your kit from modular components - a primary weapon (normal attacks), secondary weapon (anti-shield such as a grab), gadget (special moves), and a suit (base stats and passives). The result is a ton of variety, but without an overwhelming cast of characters to learn how to play/play against.\r\n* **Deep, but highly accessible**. This game is heavily inspired by the competitive side of platform fighters such as Smash Bros and Rivals of Aether, but the mechanics and movesets are as streamlined as possible without sacrificing depth, perfect for fighting game newcomers.\r\n\nP.S. there\u2019s an online matchmaker, but if you\u2019re having trouble finding a match due to the low player count feel free to ping the [Discord](https://discord.gg/z9jGz6f77H)!\n\nThere's also a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/counterpicklabs) if you'd like to follow along there. \n\nThanks!",

Geoff obviously does the best he can with what studios will give him and I appreciate him doing something to try and keep the spirit of E3 alive.",

It was enjoyable enough, some decent reveals, some good games on display, but I actually found the indie showcase after the main event much more exciting. Just not a ton of reveals on display this time aorund. It wasn't bad though, I wasn't disappointed, just not very excited either. It makes me wonder if these big events as a whole are gonna survive much longer though, and if E3 shutting down is just a precursor for things to come.",

In this one you atleast got real gameplay footage.\n\nI honestly think this trend of showing cinematic trailers should die off and a game reveal should be about the gameplay itself. Cinematic trailers can be made during the game launch.",

All of it kinda hurts.\n\nYet, every few years a game comes out that makes me feel like a child. Right now I feel lucky, Elden Ring did it to me last year and this year it\u2019s without doubt Tears of the Kingdom that reminds me of why I love to play games.",

I know the lore is different, but in terms of gameplay Elden Ring is just a really good open world Dark Souls. It is a natural series evolution. Tears of the Kingdom is incredibly derivative of BotW, so I would view that as iterative and low risk as well.",

If a game I've never played from 30 years ago with a good facelift can grip me, modern games have no excuse for looking so bland and uninteresting.",

                            "comment": "Yeah, times have changed etc but if you look at the E3 of old back around 2018 backwards the E3 season *was* a series of wall-to-wall AAA announcements. This show is advertised as being a replacement for that when it has never really hit those levels. \n\nIn 2018 alone there was the announcement or gameplay of: Anthem, A Plague Tale, AC Odyssey, Beyond Good and Evil 2 (lol), Crackdown 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Devil May Cry 5, Fallout 76, Elder Scrolls 6, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Forza 4, Gears 5, Just Cause 4, Kingdom Hearts 3, Last of Us Part II, Octopath Traveller, \n\n(not a perfect list but they were all on a 'shown at E3 2018 list). \n\nWhile all of these didn't land, and some were bad on release, this last E3 which was widely considered to be a 'bad' one was packed with announcements. I think it is fine to be critical of a show that says it is the replacement that ends up being mostly an infomercial for already announced sequels. \n\nNot saying it *has* to live up to that standard, but I think folks are within their rights to be a bit disappointed with the show that has been positioned as 'the new E3', although I believe the closest quote to this is Geoff saying 'E3 killed itself'. \n\nEven compared to previous years, this was a damp squib. 2021 had Elden Ring, Tiny Tina's Wonderland, Death Stranding Directors Cut, Jurassic World 2, Lost Ark, Sable, Two Point Campus, \n\nThis was a very 'ok' presentation, but I can see why folks are disappointed.",

Warhammer looks cool, Alan Wake looks good,  not necessarily my thing but looks well made.. a few interesting indies here and there but it felt like there were 7 or 8 games that were only slight variations of each other.",

They\u2019re not trying to be the next 60/70 dollar experience and they have way less power in the industry, so if there\u2019s a bit of trend following there too\u2026 at least for me it still manages to be more interesting and unique, probably because my taste in games skews heavily indie anyway.",

Of course, Microsoft could show some heavy hitters but we should temper our expectations.

And wasn't the reveal of the game, which was at the Xbox show two years earlier. It doesn't look like there was a traditional megathread for SGS2021 but [this seems to be the closest thing and as you can see people didn't really seem to think it was a killer show for the most part.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nwmslo/summer_games_fest_e3_megathread/?sort=new)\n\n&gt; Not only that, Geoff\u2019s TGA has shown major announcements before.\n\nThe Game Awards is a different show than Summer Games Fest, half a year later. Other than being put together by the same people they don't really have much to do with each other. And since there tend to not be many other big events at that time of year that one has better offerings to pick from. The landscape is totally different when trying to do a show in June.",

Incredible how they manage to promote the most bland looking garbage when there's so many interesting things if they just got over the insecurity of talking about anything without a 7 figure budget.\n\nAlso why do so many of these games look like those \"I remade X in UE4!\" videos. AAA scene is crying out for art directors who can say no",

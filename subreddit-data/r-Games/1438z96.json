I have a pc,ps4, swtich so I think there\u2019s a lot of possible options but it\u2019s real tricky finding something really but i guess diablo 4 and honkai star rail new update,  jagged alliance 3 when it releaseed, street fighter 6 this week will do but thanks for the suggestions",

I only play on pc and suck, so easy mode or similar is more than welcome.\n\nI don't like going round and round, give me a-to-b tracks, preferably a nice view (or it can be a post-apocalyptic hellscape) and an openish world or something to do between races. I don't like real sports, so f1, nascar, rally or similar are out anyway, as are trucks (tried truck simulator, we didn't click, not because it's not a racer).\n\nyes to sports cars, no to a suzuki with nitro. futuristic stuff, weapons, destruction and running people over are fine but I don't think any of the floating 'car' kinda games or even kart racers have anything but races anyway. \n\nstuff I've played/have on the radar include all the nfs titles that are or should be to my liking, burnout paradise, clutch, carmageddon 1-2 (tdr and the remake nope), tdu 1-2, gas guzzlers, forza horizon, the crew, fuel, sonic all-stars whatever, and that's about it (there are a few more round circuit-based ones).",

    "postText": "Okay guys I'm doing v-important research into video games and I need you guys to help me with this it's p-important.\n\nI've made a list of video games where you can pet the dogs. This is important. But I think there's more video games where you can pet the dogs? Dogs are good so please help me add to the list.\n\nHere is the list:\n\n\n\n* Watch Dogs 2\n* \n* The Sims 3\n* \n* Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain\n* \n* Far Cry 5\n* \n* Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins\n* \n* Fable II\n* \n* Assassin\u2019s Creed Rogue Remastered\n* \n* The Sims 2\n* \n* Fable III\n* \n* Far Cry Primal\n* \n* Fallout 4\n* \n* Valiant Hearts: The Great War\n* \n* Nintendogs\n* \n* The Sims\n* \n* The Last Guardian\n* \n* Pet the Pup at the Party\n* \n* Life is Strange\n* \n* The Walking Dead Season 2\n* \n* Undertale\n* \n* Grand Theft Auto V\n* \n* Final Fantasy XV\n* \n* Super Mario Odyssey\n* \n* The Sims 4\n\nPlease help if you find any more good puppers I need to know about them. \n\nEdit: hi instead of gilding this post please go donate to your local shelter. Dogs are good. \n\nAlso thanks for more games with dogs. This is vital. I\u2019ll add them later when I\u2019m not in a car. I\u2019m in a car now though. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like this post fear not: the dogs still like you. Unless you seriously unironically use big words to sound faux smart. \n\nEdit 2: I'M HERE WITH MORE DOGS\n\n* World of Warcraft\n*\n* Final Fantasy VIII\n\n*\n\n* Assassin\u2019s Creed III\n\n*\n\n*The Last of Us\n\n*\n\n*Warframe\n\n*\n\n*Uncharted 4: A Thief's End\n\n*\n\n*Final Fantasy XIV\n\n*\n\n*Assassin\u2019s Creed  IV: Black Flag\n\n*\n\n*Haunting Grounds\n\n*\n\n*Dragon Age Origins\n \n*\n\n*Warioware Touched\n\nAlso I have seen many accusations that I am Naked Jake but I don't know who that is. I'm Sam. \n\nI've also seen accusations that I'm a dog. I'm actually a hyena though.\n\nEdit 3: Dogs!",

[They even interviewed the director about it](https://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-director-on-why-you-cant-pet-dogs-in-the-game/) and although the reason was \"it not fitting the design philosophy\" it really boiled down to the standard open-world reason of \"why bother spending money to make this if we can't reuse it in loads of different places\".\n\nIt's a shame because BotW is full of little touches that are there just to add character and aren't really reused (hell, patting a horse is halfway towards having patting a dog already animated) and that philosophy is why there isn't really proper fishing or canoeing in the game, which I thought were disappointing omissions.",

They used to decay quickly, the items to keep them up were expensive, and if you didn't have a certain upgrade they'd die and you'd lose them forever if you forgot.\n\nThat was changed in a recent update. Now the previous benefits from the upgrade are baseline (notably, pets will be put in stasis instead of dying), and now if you have the upgrade the item you use to upkeep them is dirt cheap.\n\nUnfortunately, they're still usually not worth bringing on missions because they don't have access to the Vacuum mod or an equivalent, so even a sentinel that does absolutely nothing else is still generally better than a kubrow, kavat, or charger. The only time I use my kubrow is if I want to do a spy mission with Limbo (my kubrow gives me stealth).",

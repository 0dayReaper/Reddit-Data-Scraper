The game is fun in theory, but not when you have to play the same god damn levels over and over again because either the RNG sucks or the map pool is too damn small.\n\nThey also blew it out with the \"custom level support\", you can't really do much with it so it sucks. \n\nSomeone should come and make this type of game but with more levels in general.",

Idk why they can't just put every map and variation into the pool with even rng. I imagine it must be some technical limitation where the game has to keep all that shit in memory or something. Otherwise I don't really understand why they'd add limitations like that as it just makes the game less fun.",

It's frankly embarrassing that they've released all these maps, but you can only play a small number of them because the game is so badly optimized. \n\nIirc they actually tried to justify \"vaulting\" maps with some bullshit excuse, but it's so obvious that it just makes the game so much worse.",

Which limited your pool of buyable rewards with the non mtx currency to a couple of items every day. Most incredibly underwhelming too. They should have really just made all the old content purchasable upfront with your non mtx currency.",

Even in situations where you would want switch between a clear and a bossing skill, it would essentially be the same combat, you'd just hold down a different button instead of your clear skill for bosses and tough rares.\n\nI love poe and i'm not trying to bash it here, its just that they would have to massively rework how skills work in order to have rotations or spenders. It will probably be more about sustaining buffs, dots and pseudo-dot skills.",

Ice nova works fantastic with frostbolt for example or contagion with essence drain. If PoE 2 skills are designed with that sort of thing in mind then it could work out really well. It doesn't even need to be specific combos, it could be as simple as \"casting a cold spell increases the damage of your next lightning and fire spell, stacking up to 5 times\". That way you're rewarded for weaving multiple types of spells.",

I don't even think it's underpowered, it's just that PoE players really, really don't want to do something like that when the alternative is \"mash one button like it's WoW circa 2004\".\n\nI'm not sure what the correct answer is here, but if every build is expected to weave different abilities like that... well...

So to make it feel good you need cast speed and AOE and defenses because you're constantly standing still... or in POE2 you can just slot in Fireball as your second skill so you can dodge easily and annihilate trash mobs and save your flameblast for nuking hard targets.\n\nOf course people will optimize the fun out of the game; but there was a reason NOBODY did multiple skills even if they wanted to, and that reason is cancerous regearing, which will be fixed.",

I say so in my original comment aswell. \n\nThere are already builds that do this like rf throwing fire traps on bosses, int stacking wanders using PS for bosses and KB for clear, and bow builds using LA/IS/TS and Artillery ballista. Its therefore not really a big change to how the actual gameplay will play out, its already part of the game albeit not for all builds/skills.\n\nI just don't see the \"weaving\" part, where you would use several damaging skills on the same target, unless they have some sort of duration. You might use galvanic field, storm brand and orb of storms as 6-links on a crackling lance or arc build, because those 3 have durations and 1 cast of them is more total damage than a cast of CL/Arc.\n\nI like the change to the socket system (i think, havent played it yet obviously) but it won't suddenly make all builds play like lost ark or d4. I personally don't want poe to be like those things either.",

It makes more sense to use defensive triggers and auras, or non-combat purposes like movement.\n\nMoving the slots from your gear to a menu isn't going to change that on it's own.  They're going to need to actually change the way combat works as a whole.  Maybe you'll use a buff and then spam your DPS skill, but that's not all that better.",

Dedicated clear, dedicated single target, dedicated damage booster (think totem or other set it and forget it dps skills). \n\n\nThe fact is right now, most builds are better off just giga juicing one skill because of the link issue.",

Bosses, zones, and certain types of content have a set power level, and making a build capable of breaking through those damage and survivability checks isn't easy, especially as you go further and further into the game. Over time, player skill has become much more important for fighting end-game bosses, but to even reach that point you have to successfully balance a whole bunch of complicated levers. For the people who enjoy PoE, a huge part of the enjoyment isn't actually killing the boss, it's making a build that can even reach that point.",

Combined with the game being made for you quitting after a month then coming back, you can pick a few mechanics to explore every league then try different ones the next league. You can even remove many mechanics from showing up entirely and doing so even increases your chances of finding the remaining enabled content.\n\nSo while I understand choice paralysis is a thing, that's kind of a skill issue because this game rewards focused strategy so you're way better off focusing on one or two things regardless, like 'oh to get my league starter up I will farm expedition to get Rog crafts' or 'I will farm essences and sell them early' or stuff like that.",

Grinding for currency just so you can then buy whatever you want, especially with PoE's awful trade system feels awful, but the drop rates make SSF unplayable unless you want to invest hundreds of hours into the game, which then feels even worse because of the wipe every 4 months.\n\nAnd you can just do it like Last Epoch. Any SSF item has a tag that makes it untradable.\n\nI don't think that OSRS/RS3 are a good comparison. RS has target farming so as long as you're willing to grind you can get anything eventually. Like if you want a certain armor, you just gotta kill the boss that drops it and you'll get it eventually. But in Path of Exile you can only target farm for certain items, everything else is just random. And that feels really bad to me, but in PoE terms I'm a noob even with hundreds of hours played in the last 5 years.",

I have farmed a HH and a Mageblood SSF, I have done all content in the game SSF, it feels rewarding working towards a goal. When I play SSF, I play builds that require less gear until I can farm specific things I might want to try. You adjust your plans and work around what drops. If you want to play solo using one specific unique from day one, go trade and just trade that one item.\n\nI don't think they should just throw up a million game modes for every single person's desire. I'm already against Ruthless mode, I wouldn't want Easy mode either. If Headhunters and perfectly rolled items dropped every 100 maps, it would devalue the point to playing any other game mode. They would never do that and it would kill the longevity and desire to put those hundreds of hours in.\n\nThat's why we play the game, the rare things are fun to chase because they are rare.

I always come back to RS after a 6 month break and have fun grinding because I'm working towards multiple long term goals and I never lose anything. But I haven't been able to get into PoE because I know I'll have to start from the beginning if I stop playing for that long. Path of Exile feels like a full time job, the amount of time you need to put in it in a specific time period really means you need to play Path of Exile and nothing else. \n\nAnd for your multiple game modes, why not look at OSRS and RS3. RS3 is for all intents much easier, with much lesser grinds, but people still play it, and they still grind. If you look at your average RS3 player I guarantee you they have way more playtime than your average OSRS player, even if you're just counting the last year or so. Does RS3's existence means that OSRS is worthless? No. Now do I think it's a good idea for Path of Exile to do something similar? Not really. We might get something like it with PoE2, assuming it won't just outright replace PoE1 like with Overwatch 2. But I doubt it, since GGG already has a hard time balancing stuff, and so balancing for what would essentially be two different games would put a lot of stress on them, and in the end you'd have two worse games for it. \n\nBut as it is, I just haven't been able to get into PoE in years, the last league I really did anything in was Betrayal, and seeing how GGG is handling things I doubt I'll play it again any time soon.",

There's already 8 game modes every league, I've said it a dozen times in this thread but added 4 more where drops are higher:\n\n* Kills the other options\n* Kills player progression\n* Kills long term replayability/grind.\n\nThus GGG will never do it, for good reason. PoE players aren't complaining about drop rates, random people on /r/Games and /r/PCGaming are, and wouldn't play the game regardless so their opinions aren't really relevant. You said yourself you haven't played in 3 years, why should they rebalance the whole game around your opinion?\n\n&gt;seeing how GGG is handling things I doubt I'll play it again any time soon.\n\nI don't even know what this is in context to or what you're upset about.

It is much easier than OSRS and yet people still play both. In fact a lot of people play both games. Why would adding an easier gamemode make the harder one meaningless? And OSRS also has ultimate ironman which makes the game harder and much more tedious and people play that too just for the added challenge. \n\nAnd PoE players definitely complain about drop rates. Almost every single launch you'll see threads about it on /r/pathofexile. Unless those people don't count? \n\nLike I said, I don't think that GGG will ever add anything like it considering they seem to be focusing on making the game slower and grinder. But I still hope they do. PoE has a lot of good things going for it, but the game is almost tailor made to waste your time and make everything take forever.",

He said the goal was to slow things down just slightly so you\u2019d still be zooming 99% of the time, but instead of that 1% of the time being \u201csorry, that guy killed you before he was onscreen\u201d, now you\u2019d actually have a chance to fight back. \n\nI understand where they\u2019re coming from since so many people complained about unfair deaths they couldn\u2019t have done anything about, and I think they\u2019re pretty close to that goal now. The game is still very fast, but every once in a while you get a rare mob that makes you sit up straight in your chair and pay attention for a few seconds.\n\nDefences are also in a pretty good spot, so it\u2019s relatively easy to become tanky enough that you don\u2019t die in most normal scenarios.",

At least before I quit (early 2020), the leagues where POE reddit had been the most unhappy were also the leagues with the fastest collapse of playercount. The leagues where GGG recanted, in part or in whole, decisions that POE reddit hated were the leagues that had the biggest player counts at launch.\n\nI mean, yes, there is a big discrepancy between the subreddit and the median POE player... but the median POE player likely doesn't even make it to the end of the campaign. And yes, people are generally really bad at identifying where they differ from the \"norm.\" But I think the case here is one where the counter-argument is distorted by the sheer number of people that \"play\" the game because it's F2P, but abandoned it without engaging in the primary systems.\n\nOf the players that engage with the endgame extensively, I'd say the subreddit's population is (or, well, *was* as of my quiting) fairly representative. Not perfectly so, of course, but within the realms of what you can reasonably hope to get out of an online community I'd say it was there. I'd consider at least level 85 and playing in yellow maps or above as \"extensive\" in this context.",

Yes there might be a lot there that will get somewhere to early endgame, but at the same time you also have to realize that the game is designed around the players that grinds the absolutely highest level of content etc. \n\nThe reality is the game is still designed to be pretty punishing, it's extremely grindy but it offers the avenues to do so, but the average person that uses the PoE subreddit is not the kinda player that plays the game well enough or efficiently enough to engage with the majority of what the devs put in the game. \n\nWhich neither of those things are a problem, the problem comes when those same players are now *convinced* that the game *HAS* to be changed to be exactly how they'd like it and build around them otherwise the game is bad. \n\nIt's a kind of weird inverse inevitable outcome of devs being very engaged when it comes to communicating with their playerbase. The more the players feel like they have a direct connection to the development of the game, the worse their attitude becomes. It leads to players thinking they now have power over how the game should be designed and any changes that don't 100% reflect them are attacking them personally.\n\nThat said obviously I'm not saying every decision GGG makes is perfect, far from it, but I will say from experience that most of the actually good PoE players do not engage with that community and that community also hasn't really said anything intelligent or productive for ages now. But hey maybe we could make a post about how trade dumb!!! for the quajillionth time.",

App can be downloaded from the respective app stores, and need a one-time Netflix login with an active subscription.\n\nAlternately you can launch from the Netflix app games section, but who wants to deal with that.\n\nFor anyone/everyone complaining about \"wah Netflix exclusivity\", know that a lot of these mobile ports wouldn't have been made in the first place without funding from Netflix. That was the case w/ Into The Breach.\n\nOther worthwhile games on mobile published by Netflix (i.e. requiring a one-time Netflix login):\n\n* Terra Nil  \n* TMNT Shredder's Revenge  \n* Into The Breach  \n* World of Goo  \n* Oxenfree  \n* Spiritfarer  \n* Desta: The Memories Between  \n* Valiant Hearts  \n* Arcanium  \n* Raji  \n* Kentucky Route Zero  \n* Moonlighter  \n* Reigns: Three Kingdoms\n* Twelve Minutes  \n* Immortality\n\nYes, many of these are mobile ports of well-received PC indie games.",

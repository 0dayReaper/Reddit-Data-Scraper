Microsoft does have the cash lying around but I still think it's way too much.\n\nFor context, that deal would be like like Nvidia-ARM money ($40B) or like twice what Facebook spent on Whatsapp ($22B) and frankly both of those are of *way* more strategic importance than MS fleshing out their portfolio of games.\n\nI also imagine EA specifically would be tricky as a lot of their value comes from exclusive sports licensing, and who knows if those leagues would be happy to renew their deals with a platform holder (especially FIFA, since ~~MS~~Xbox doesn't have a big presence in Europe).",

Fallout 76 at least seems to have turned the corner, but I don't know.\n\nThis acquisition deal has to be super recent since the timed exclusive business was only announced months ago.",

They kept it as a 4 for at least a day after the bug was fixed. As much as I, and most who pay much attention to gaming, dislike IGN their reviews are incredibly impactful.

This will certainly shake up the industry, and I could see other major players (Sony, Tencent, Google, Activision Blizzard, EA) responding with acquisitions of their own.",

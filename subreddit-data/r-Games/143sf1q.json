    "postText": "Codename: Loop is a twin-stick shooter game based on Half-Life.\r  \n\r  \nThe initial goal of the game was to make a Roguelike game based on Half-Life, but with the almost complete BSP support, I'm going to be focusing more on linear campaigns with \"dynamic/random\" stuff and user-created campaigns. The roguelike mode will be something additional and will be added after making an official campaign for Codename: Loop.\u200b\r  \n\r  \nThe plot of the game is not written yet but the main idea is that G-Man confined Gordon Freeman inside an ever-changing loop to test if he is able to escape from it to ensure that he is a truly worth hiring candidate.\r  \n\r  \nThe game is made in Unity from the ground up, it uses a special BSP Importer (Thanks to Zombie) that allows me to create all the rooms using J.A.C.K. Hammer Editor to ensure the same \"vibe\" of GoldSrc games and also allows users to create their own custom campaigns. I'm also making some custom models, textures, and animations to improve some aspects of the original assets. (like all the third person animations and weapon models).\r  \n\r  \nFeatures\r  \n\r  \nExperience Half-Life as a twin-stick shooter game.\r  \nPlay custom user-made campaigns\r  \n\u200bPlay a \"Roguelike\" inspired extra game mode.\r  \nCustom skins for the player model because is cool to play as scientist Gordon, or as Ivan!\r  \n\u200bAnd More!  \n\n\n  \nhttps://www.moddb.com/games/codename-loop",

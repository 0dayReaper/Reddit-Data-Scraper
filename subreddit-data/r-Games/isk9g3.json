We were 100% confident that anyone being flagged as a cheater was DEFINITELY cheating. \n\nThis was super important to us. \n\nWe didn't want to falsely ban anyone.\n\nLast week... something exciting happened!\n\nThere were finally enough cheaters to actually matchmake and create Cheater Island matches!\n\nHere's a new problem though...\n\nPeople were uploading videos that we *think* are Cheater Island...\n\nSomebody actually uploaded this video to Reddit with the title:\n\n\"Ever played a round of Fall Mountain where all the players are cheating?\"\n\nThe problem is... this LOOKS like Cheater Island but we can't be 100% sure\n\n[Video 1](https://twitter.com/i/status/1305487609565794305)\n\nHere's another video that we think is Cheater Island\n\nThe person recording isn't cheating...\n\nEither they didn't cheat, just for the video...\n\nOr it's a genuine server and a legit player...\n\nEither way, it makes the game look bad\n\n[Video 2](https://twitter.com/i/status/1305487611629375489)\n\nWe DO know that Cheater Island matches were happening\n\nWe just DON'T know if that's what those videos show\n\nFor that reason, we have closed down Cheater Island\n\nInstead, cheaters are now unable to login\n\nWe are continuously improving the threshold on our cheat detection too\n\nOur cheat detection system was good... but we hadn't expected so many players... and we had no idea the lengths that some players would go to cheat\n\nWe tried to create a system around \"Honesty\"... but as soon as we realised we were in an ARMS RACE we called up the experts at Epic\n\nNow... \n\nOur next update is called:\n\nBIG YEETUS AND ANTI-CHEATUS\n\nI'll tell you more about the Yeetus part later\n\nBut the Anti-Cheatus part...\n\nWe're actually adding Epic's Anti-Cheat which will be a huge step forward as we continue to improve things!\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nI realise this has been an insanely long thread...\n\nBut... \n\nThat's the story of Cheater Island...\n\nAnd the reasoning behind why we've been so cryptic and vague!",

Though I'd bet that's a little harder with Steam IDs (if that's where the vid is), since those can be changed willy-nilly.  Either way, you'd think they'd have have enough logs to find the game with the player ids that are in the video and back-trace from there.",

Just from that info alone (which is about the bare minimum of logging they should be doing), you probably can narrow it down to a single game, and backtrace all the players in the room to make sure they all belonged on Cheater Island.  On top of that, they *hopefully* have some sort of outfit tracking data (they'd want to know which outfits are popular and being played with), so you can double-check that the 3 we see in that first video have matching outfits to what we expect.",

You're literally cutting out every bit of gameplay there is! I honestly don't understand the point. People go to such effort to just sit and watch the screen change instead of play the game.\n\n**Edit:** since this got some attention... I thought I'd say that I've found it interesting how there are two distinctly differing ideas about what motivates cheaters. There are those who simply do not like the feeling of losing, so they do whatever they have to to make sure that doesn't happen (including cheating), and then there are those who simply want to troll and make other people upset by being anarchistic disruptive chaos engines for their own amusement.  These are probably both valid reasons why people choose to engage in cheating, and which type of cheater you are encountering may depend a lot on which game you're playing.",

To try and spot the subtle cheaters better I actually tried out a few of the aimbots on a private server with other admins.\n\nYou could adjust how close you had to be to an enemy's head before it would lock on or what maximum distance between you and the enemy you had to be. So this would prevent people spinning around instantly and headshotting you, and you could keep it from locking on to someone across the map, but as soon as you were about mid-range and actually lined up your crosshair to their head... it'd lock on and you'd undoubtedly win the firefight. And it would just look like the player was really good when close enough but not improbably good anywhere else.\n\nThere were other features (some of which were actually insane), but that's the one that I had to learn to watch out for when spectating suspects.",

It's their way of goofing off.\n\n[\"I was just bored and I wanted to do something different so I just cheated and it was pretty fun. It's funny to see people online getting really angry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyI5u-SQUYc)\"\n\n\"[It's the enjoyment to see people's reaction to you.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyI5u-SQUYc#t=2m21s)\n\n\"I [...] just wanted attention most of the time. [...] I would enjoy laughing at people [...].\"\n\n\"It's [...] just fun to mess with people.\"\n\n\"In TF2 for example, people literally rage and rage-quit. I get a feeling of having something unique. It's actually another way to play the game.\"\n\nLet me pose different examples in the same vein: pranks, laughing at other's mistakes, slapstick, tickling, teasing, [cringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversial_Reddit_communities#CringeAnarchy), bullying. All includes humour I categorize under the umbrella term [Schadenfreude](https://www.google.com/search?q=schadenfreude). People enjoy teasing others. \n\nPersonally I try to avoid this kind of humour. I think it is one of the closest things to pure evil in human nature. It's like the opposite of sympathy. But it is socially accepted and probably universal. So much comedy is at someone's expense. Even if you don't partake, you probably have a friend that does. \n\nWhen my friends break each others' balls, I say that I understand it but I abstain. There isn't much point for me to bring it up though, because it just makes the person feel ashamed and [defensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology\\)). At least we come to an implicit agreement and they leave me alone. I think the effective reaction is essentially \"I'm not angry; I'm just disappointed.\" If they get a rise out of you, it only feeds into them.\n\nTo be fair, there is also a benefit to being able to laugh off misfortune.",

I remember a long long long time ago I got some cheats for Payday 2 and decided it'd be fun to fuck with others in the lobby. Really fun getting reactions and stuff, but then I started using the cheats to get leveled up and gain more money until I got bored. To be clear, I got bored in about less than 2 hours and never played the game again.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople who go through so much excruciating trouble and pain just to cheat at a game and get away with it must have some *serious* issues that can't be explained through blanket statements. Most just cheat and move on, but *those* types of cheaters are the real issue and they deserve absolutely no sympathy or attention.",

These people have typically received a lot of praise early in life (it can take the form of spoiled parenting) and believe they are capable of anything naturally and without effort. When they encounter a problem that they can't solve easily, they get frustrated because they feel like they are entitled to being good at a any task, without effort.\n\nIn contrast, growth mindsets are the opposite of this. They understand that even experts had to develop their skills and while natural talent can help, it can be surpassed by effort and will.\n\nI was of a fixed mindset until fairly recently. I was very smart as a child and found things like school, sports, and other activities trivially easy. I received tons of praise which I believe caused me to stunt the growth of my mindset. I still find myself getting frustrated when I'm not immediately the best at any given task. Being aware of mindsets has helped tremendously in defusing frustrations and refocusing that energy into becoming better at the task at hand.",

Just change the definition of smart you're using to be inclusive of effort in addition to effortless intelligence (which is what most people use it to mean). Being smart can also mean you know how to work on a problem that isn't obvious to you. The fact that it isn't obvious to you doesn't make you not smart, but the way people use it generally leads to that feeling.\n\nSo if your kid does something effortlessly, you can call that smart. But when they struggle and still work through something anyway, call that smart too.",

Once the game detects you're cheating by whatever method, you're basically dropped out of the game but the client keeps on as though you're still playing.   The server agrees with everything the client pushes to it but doesn't pass it on to the other players, and you get your no-skill kills and 'win' screen.  Everyone else just sees you drop out shortly after you start flying or whatever.  If there's some multiplayer score or ranking or whatever then it increases for you but not for anyone else.",

It happens on dota's matchmaking. It happens on Pokemon Go where everything but common trash runs from you. It happens on reddit where no one can see your posts.\n\nSome games are smart and do newbie-bans too. Play fortnite on a new account. You will 100% guaranteed win the match, because theyre all bots and you're silently being calibrated and judged for a smurf or not. I see nothing negative about that approach and it's dumb that League/Dota don't do it.",

If they autofill into a team game just moments before their team wins, does that feel good to them? \n\nWhen I was much younger, I dabbled in cheats, but for me the enjoyment wasn't even really \"winning\", it was just about the power trip. Going on a rampage in GTA or somesuch can be cathartic, but holding that same kind of power over other real people elevates the feeling quite a bit. Of course, eventually the guilt of ruining the fun for others outweighed that enjoyment and I never looked back.\n\nMaybe it's the prominence of ranking systems these days that incentivizes these win addicts, where they can show off and brag about it and enjoy the positive attention from that even if they know it's unearned.",

The ideal for a shadowban is that they don't realize they're banned, but aren't harming the general population. Cheater island didn't accomplish this because it became obvious that something wasn't right for cheaters. It also made it very easy to make the game look bad if you just turn off the cheats and record a clip for twitter.\n\nThe best possible outcome would've come from shadowbanning them into games full of bots. They'd have to determine if who they're playing with are bots or not, and even if they're just taking replay data and replaying it for them would make it pretty difficult to tell if you're playing with real people or not.\n\nThat means they stay trapped in their own little cheater's heaven and won't bother real people even after they get caught. Now that it's just a straight ban, they can just rebuy the game from some shady website selling fraudulently-purchased keys and do it all over again.",

Used the ban check extension for chrome and found over half my games had someone who later got vac banned (a couple game bans as well). 12 cheaters in 16 games is absurd, especially at that low a level.\n\nI don't think that was all of them as well, I still remember some very sketchy moments where someone would get amazingly fast headshots on players crossing a wall, after checking the replays. I just assumed they had amazing game-sense or something similar, but now I think they were being very sneaky with walls after seeing those other cheaters getting caught.

They don't want cheaters showing cheat content at all in shared clips, as a matter of public image, which is irrelevant to the matter of wether or not You and Me play with these cheaters.

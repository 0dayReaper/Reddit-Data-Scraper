It's not *perfect* in execution, but it's a step in the right direction at least.\n\nThe game last I checked is only around 35-40 gigabytes on PC with cosmetic streaming compared to 60 for the full install, and you can get it down to around 22-25 gigabytes if you uninstall the high resolution textures, which while still not *tiny*, is still a lot better than the nearly 100 gig install it used to be before they finally started compressing it better and adding asset streaming.",

That way, as it is set alongside of a higher-powered Xbox Series X type consoles, the Series S would have a good amount of space to store games. The size of games now, are much larger than in the past and larger SDD space size is essential.",

It's the sort of thing that you see in scifi films, TV, and literature all the time, but until now I don't really think any game has offered it as a gameplay possibility outside of specific scripted scenarios.\n\nThe entire showcase was pretty impressive, but even if it wasn't I'd probably still have picked the game up in order to have that experience. As it stands, I'm more hyped for this game than any release in years. It looks like Bethesda may have done it again.\n\nAt this point almost all my concerns about the game re gunplay, immersion, scope etc seem to have been answered. \n\nI really only have two major concerns left:\n\nHow good will the story and characters be? (These can always be hit or miss in Bethesda games frankly.)\n\nAnd how will the game run and play at launch? That's by far my greatest concern, we all know that Bethesda has been shipping buggy games since before it was cool, and these days with so many broken AAA releases I do fear that this could launch could turn out ugly.\n\nThat said, I really would like to think that they've learned their lesson with F:76 and that this game will launch in a better state. Hopefully that's why it was delayed so much. I'm not expecting perfection, but I just need the game to be stable enough at release that I can play at a decent FPS and without a modicum of game breaking bugs. I can live with it being a little bit bumpy as I know that this game will have years of post launch support.",

Then that western looking city which was some Mos Eisley experience. New Atlantis reminded me of the Citadel from Mass Effect and finally some of the other locations on the spaceports and the strategy rooms were straight out of the Belt.\n\nThere's no clear one inspiration. It's like it's taken bits from every popular style and giving the players their own incentive to explore worlds and styles that is closer to what they want from sci-fi.",

You have caravan traders for some of the main areas. Due to their pathing and random encounters they could in theory hit a random encounter and fight and die, and then when you looked for the reader they would be dead at one of the outposts they go by because something happens in the world while you're not there.

Other companies craft their whole story, whole narrative and then open the world around it. It then leads to the feeling that the world is a padding and only the main quest matters.\n\nBethesda has admitted that the world is the first thing they build, once they get the idea for the setting and the main story. It leads to a detailed world worth exploring. Full of small stories. I tend to liken it to a mosaic. Bethesda worlds are not monolithic. It's all the collection of small, inconsequential stories, small NPC interactions and tons of tiny bits of details... all that makes the world what it is. Not the main quest.\n\nWhich is what the companies who try to mimic Bethesda don't get. All the side content, notes, random dialogues... that is what makes the world so deep. What gives it personality and gives it history. Not the main quest. In Bethesda games, the main quest just takes the player on a tour in a world that exists almost independently. In other games, take out the main quest and the \"open world\" remains just a husk where you can kill random enemies and find X landmarks. But in Bethesda games, the main quest is like 5% of the whole game. If you gave me Fallout 3 or Skyrim without the main quest, I'd still play the hell out of those games.",

But no, holy shit, Bethesda blew my expectations out of the fucking water.\n\nThat ship customization alone blew my mind. It is what I've wanted from space sim games for YEARS. The ability to not only change weapons and paintjobs, but to swap out, add or remove entire systems, rooms, modules, engines, cockpits? You can't find that level of modularity and customization anywhere else in the genre. And then you can hire crews for your ships? And companions can become crew members? Incredible.\n\nAnd then the actual space combat and mechanics is everything Star Citizen wishes it was. Power allocation, subsystem targeting, different weapon types and classes, giant capital ships with full interiors, boarding, communication with other vessels, piracy. I love it.\n\nLike it seems like Starfield is just an incredible space sim ON-TOP OF a Bethesda exploration and questing RPG. Not to mention that the character combat they showed off today looked leagues better than what they had shown before. I think Bethesda has another Skyrim-level success on their hands, because buggy mess or not Starfield looks fuckin incredible.",

Unless there's some elaborate scam and the things advertised are not in the game, this will become another Bethesda masterpiece. Skyrim was the game of 2010s, THE game that defined the decade.

The game that every space game will from now on try to copy, weaving roleplaying, storytellng and exploration...",

You can't find that level of modularity and customization anywhere else in the genre. And then you can hire crews for your ships? And companions can become crew members? Incredible.\n\nHonestly the closest thing I can think of that scratches the itch starfield claims to be hitting bloody FTL. Granted you can't build a ship but there are a lot of options and layouts that really vary your run. It's like someone saw FTL and fully realised it.",

Nothing shows confidence in your project then dedicating an entire hour just to showing it off and talking about the game in as much detail as they\u2019re allowed to. It wasn\u2019t just a gameplay demo with some narration and behind the scenes talks, it was all of that and more. Every single aspect of the game got it\u2019s own segment and discussion, with their own gameplay demos. \n\nAbsolutely loved it, looked like so much fun. Gunplay was massively improved, base-building looks better then ever, the world seems great, tons of stuff and distractions to find, I love the art style, the character creator, improvements to roleplaying, gah. I could go on for, well, almost an hour.\n\nWell done to Bethesda. I really hope the game delivers on launch, because this showcase was truly impressive. I expected 20-30 minutes, not a full hour.",

I know that every Bethesda game, even the great ones, launch with some serious issues and frequently miss the things they promise. Preordering is just idiotic, all things considered. \n\nI am feeling like I\u2019m going to be an idiot, because I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say this direct isn\u2019t the coolest thing I\u2019ve seen in gaming in years. I cannot remember the last time I was this excited for a game. This is almost everything I want out of Star Citizen, but made by a studio I legitimately think could pull it off. Even if it falls short, it just ticks so many goddamn boxes that I have wanted to see for so long. \n\nI haven\u2019t felt like ordering a collector\u2019s edition since, like, Halo 3, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to avoid doing so. And I think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that I\u2019m on the hype train for this, after having been very hesitant.",

Like how come nobody in this populated town decided to pick up the trash in the last 200 years?

This game is just 3 months before release, so it must be more polished that Fallout 4 was back then... so they are less concerned with showing something unpolished.",

The towns in Skyrim and Fallout were barely towns, they had like 15 NPCs in them.\n\nIt's a give-and-take, because every NPC in every town of Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Skyrim had a name (outside of the guards), and every NPC (including guards) had a schedule that they stuck to but could get interrupted by the player/quests.\n\nThat's *really* cool and unique in my opinion, but you're right in that it makes the towns feel much smaller than they should. Adding nameless NPCs that you can't interact with makes the towns feel much bigger, but it also obscures the \"important\" NPCs to a certain extent.\n\nObsidian took the latter approach with New Vegas, and I think it'd surprise a lot of people that there were only about 30 named characters on the *entire* New Vegas Strip, whereas there are 75 named characters in Whiterun alone.\n\nThere's not a wrong solution, they're just both going for different things.",

I am so excited. I can't wait to start building in this. Super excited to see the new tools. But, I just love the setting. The sky is really the limit.

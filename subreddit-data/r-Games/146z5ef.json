Fable 2, Milo, Fable 3. \n\nStill remember how he hyped the map in Fable 3 being like a fully interactive real-time top-down view of the place with the NPCs being fully visible and having routines. I remember him saying you could spy on your spouse and watch how they make their way to a friend's house for a suspiciously long time. \n\nI finished Fable 3 recently and the map can't even be used to freaking navigate around! There's no proper detail at all and NPCs are just random sprites walking about aimlessly",

While not really good/evil, the 'right' choice seems to spare the many over your girlfriend (she's even willing to put her own life down for the others).  \n  \nLater in the game you need to rescue some NPC's love and if you spared your boyfriend/girlfriend in the tutorial it will be them, otherwise it will just be some other random NPC.  \nIf you spared your ex, you can get back toogether forcing them to leave the NPC which is the 'evil' option whereas the good option is stepping aside and having them continue to live their lives.   \n\nHonestly it's so weird since the good options in these quests don't really get you any interesting content, only good boy points whereas the negative karma options actually get you some unique content you'd otherwise miss out on.",

The \"good\" options generally meant people liked you, but also that you couldn't make the hard choices, which would screw you over in the long run. The \"evil\" options were often self serving but sometimes necessary, and choosing a lesser evil might give you the resources to fend off a greater one. It was honestly refreshing for a game to buck the \"evil = short term gains, good = long term gains\" trend and ask the player how much evil they'd be willing to commit in the name of a greater good.",

Just felt that saying something's \"in engine\" doesn't exactly guarantee much, especially early on. Either way, it's easy to do things in engine that won't represent the final game itself, even with base visuals and stuff, right? Reminds me of the whole debacle over Watch Dogs with the graphical reductions.",

It's a trailer making fun of the idea of \"heroes\" because with all the things players tend to do, they'd probably be seen a pretty bad person by all the NPC characters, going around acting like they're the most important person (because they're the only one with any agency) and doing whatever they want. Felt like that right sort of absurd slightly mocking british humour to me.",

Especially since it doesn't look like they're continuing the trend of each game moving forward in technological progress. This looks considerably more medieval/renaissance \u00e0 la Fable 1/2 rather than Fable 3's industrial revolution setting. I think that's probably the best choice, I just hope those modern square frames are only in this trailer for the sake of Ayoade's recognisability (even though the voice does the heavy lifting there) and aren't indicative of the final game's aesthetic.",

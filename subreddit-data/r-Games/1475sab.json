More than one asked \"WTF is creepjacking?\" Kind of a disappointing way to reveal what's going on.",

I would have much preferred a full match, the way they did Battle Reports for StarCraft II ages ago for those who remember, or at least otherwise longer pieces of uncut gameplay with narration that takes you through the experience of a match instead of somewhat chaotically cutting around it. I hope we get to see more gameplay in that vein in the near future.",

Creeps tend to reduce the viability of greedy builds by giving aggressive builds a way to mitigate the reduced economic investment. You could compensate with something else to make greedy openers viable, though.\n\n* TTK seems a bit too high. Particularly when the two vulcans ambushed the marines, they only killed a couple. That's the downside of higher TTK, it makes ambushes (or other surprises) less impactful. Would like to see TTK reduced like 20%.\n\n* Lancers and marine guys look too similar at a glance imo.\n\n* The artillery shots being dodgeable looked cool, but they look like they might be a bit too slow right now, especially since a big part of the damage is a DoT.",

Not even exaggerating, just focusing on developing your economy and then crashing your army into your opponent is enough to carry you to the top 30% of the Starcraft playerbase. You can add bits and pieces of flashy micro as you go- don't have to do it on the first day.",

Being able to micro means it's not for all skill levels?\n\nWhat's next, an FPS game having headshots means it's not for all skill levels?\n\nThere'll be skill-based matchmaking I'm sure, and also the PvE modes.

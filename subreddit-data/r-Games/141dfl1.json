The legend games do sometimes feel like the same game sometimes, and their reluctance to have any real story implications like killing off characters hurts their storytelling possibilities. (EDIT: Was a YS VIII beta tester, in case it doesn't come across that I'm a serious long-time fan of them)\n\nI thought your statement on AAA porting was great btw. My biggest pet peeve is how terrible frame pacing is nearly every AAA game (now even on console sometimes as well as PC) and how companies pretend is some insurmountable challenge, when they (well, western devs) did it fine in the 90s and in the early 2000s just fine on a lot of titles. I think the games industry in particular tends to have high turnover especially from more advanced devs that can get better pay/work life balance elsewhere, and a lot of the high-technical devs came from the DOS era.",

                            "comment": "I mostly agree with your statements regarding framepacing, though I think it's a bit more complex from a technical perspective.\n\nIn the 90s/2000s, you (mostly) (i) had level-based layouts, and (ii) much less depth and complexity in the software stack. The streaming required for large open worlds combined with the deep and complex software/hardware stack does make it more challenging to achieve smooth consistent frametimes.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of more closed off games that still have bad frame pacing. And even for the big AAA open world stuff, with the hundreds or even thousands of people that publishers throw at those, a dedicated technically skilled team should be able to iron things out to a much larger extent than what we see in practice.",

That's hardly the best they could do, and the game raked in mountains of cash.  Especially games like Soulslikes that have a really long lifetime of sales, it seems weird not to invest in good performance.",

I think a lot of Japanese devs just don't think performance is an incredibly worthwhile metric to chase, not that they shouldn't. From Soft specifically has a poor track record on both PC and console, as Durante knows from making DSFix. \n\nThe other possibility is that many Japanese devs just don't have large enough teams for ports. Just because they have the mountain of cash doesn't mean their spending it on devs to work on the engine/technical side.\n\nBut I'm certainly no expert.",

While it is nice to see news popping up here and there about certain company raising salaries...problem remains i.e. gaming companies will have a hard time finding and keeping skilled workers.  Most Japanese game makers just do not have the bandwidth and resource to do much post sales support.  And then there are some Japanese companies trying to chase western triple-A publishers' (think EA) business model...spending crazy money on IP licensing / marketing than supporting/polishing the games.",

    "postText": "I've been replaying Super Mario Bros 3 recently and whilst playing I still remembered some of the hidden secrets. For example the location of the warp whistle in level 3, world 1, required having to duck for a few seconds on one of the platforms to pass through the background.\n\nThere were so many other things like this and I wondered: how did we figure things out? In my case this knowledge came from my older sister, who was probably told by my older cousin and so on. We didn't buy any gaming magazines so in our case we only relied on word of mouth.\n\nI also wonder how much of a factor were games that didn't have a 'save' mechanic' back then, forcing players to replay the same level dozens of times which increased the likelihood of finding these gems.",

You just never learned the trick existed until some punk kid does it years later like it\u2019s no big deal.\n\n4. If you were rich you called into Nintendo and they told you all the cool secrets.",

When the service was established in the fall of 1987 it began as a free consulting service where customers were able to contact Nintendo Game Counselors by calling the toll-free number 1-800-422-2602.  The new service offering was advertised in Nintendo\u2019s free to join fan club newsletter, Nintendo Fun Club.\n\n&gt; As the service evolved and the call volumes began to grow large in size Nintendo changed the service from a toll-free number to a local phone number in the Seattle area, (206) 885-7529.  The service remained free of charge to consumers however customers were now responsible for any long-distance charges that applied. \n\nhttps://vglegacy.com/pop-culture/game-counselors/",

            "comment": "UK perspective here: A lot of magazines started publication around the time of the early-90's videogame boom, not that there *weren't* already magazines - the '83 Crash was localised strictly to North America, and so Europe still had a healthy videogame market. System-specific magazines were still a thing (for home computers like the Amiga and Spectrum) by the time consoles were becoming a thing, so it was easy for publishers to pivot to the new market.\n\nThere were multiformat magazines, such as GamesMaster (which I think is still going today), but from my Nintendo-centric upbringing you had Nintendo's official mag Nintendo Magazine System (NMS, later Nintendo Official Magazine) and Total! for all of Nintendo's consoles, then Super Play just for the SNES (that also had a lot of anime coverage as well). All had guides and tips, with SPlay beginning a dedicated section to Final Fantasy/general Squaresoft games after the release of VI, despite none of the games ever being released in the UK. Also, a lot of the advertising space was dedicated to the grey market importers for very obvious reasons.\n\nSome magazines were just collections of player guides and tips, which were rarer and entirely at the whim of the newsagents stocking them. There were even published hints and tips and guides books you could find tucked away in the shelves of WH Smiths, but rarely did they have anything new that hadn't already been published in a mainline magazine months ago.\n\nAnd there were TV shows. Channel 4 had GamesMaster, which had players competing game-show style, with tips sprinkled throughout. ITV had its own show, Bad Influence, that was more focused on news and tips (it was short-lived compared to GM, and it's own tie-in magazine was even shorter-lived). Sky had a Mario Bros themed competition show, which also demonstrated some secrets like the Warp Whistle locations, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.",

I remember some games having cheat code screens and me in my cousins  would just spend time inputting random numbers and symbols for minutes on end. Not only that but most secrets werent that hard to discover. I feel like it was gaming intuition that sometimes you just felt the need to strike a random wall, or fall down a certain pit hole because you felt like something might be under it. And even when I discovered all the secrets of the original Super Mario games they were by complete accident. Like finding the invisible blocks and flying above the end goal screen to the other side with the warp gates. All accident.\n\nNowadays I just dont expect cheats or secrets in any game, and whats funny is that its become so uncommon that some devs will actually say there are secrets for fans to discover in their games during livestreams or promo videos themselves just to get  people to try to find them.",

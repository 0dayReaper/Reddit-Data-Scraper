So much of his story is defined by being alone that I don't know how they might address it in a way that isn't whitewashing the poignancy of everything. Maybe I'm just overthinking it.",

The Usagi Yojimbo series and Miyamoto Usagi character are owned by  Stan Sakai though. They're not property of the TMNT series, and whenever the character and setting crosses over with TMNT (there were multiple crossovers with the 2003 turtles and a crossover with the 2012 turtles), they need to negotiate/involve Sakai as the rightsholder, and in those other appearances, they refer to him as \"Miyamoto Usagi\".",

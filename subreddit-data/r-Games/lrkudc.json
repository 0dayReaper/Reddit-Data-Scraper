The problem (as I understand it--I could be wrong) is that there's often a direct conflict between making a really great game that will be extremely enjoyable to some people and making a game with mass appeal that will be enjoyable enough to lots of people that it will make money. And of course, there are so many different games competing for attention and consumer dollars.      \n\nFor reasons I don't fully understand (maybe server costs?), this problem seems to be magnified with live service/mmo type games. Hidden gems/cult classics will emerge over time sometimes with offline single player games. But most live games either catch on or flame out in a hurry... like Wildstar, Paragon, Gigantic, Atlas Reactor, Lawbreakers, Battleborn, etc etc.  And some or all of those were honestly really good games.",

Playing as a Stalker with bad netcode or, y'know, lag was an incredibly frustrating exercise. I swear to god, Medics were only considered so reliable in PVP because they had giant telegraphs that could **actually** hit what they were aiming at.\n\nStill, I maintain that their housing system is still best-in-class. Even today.",

The fact that you can use your island as a staging area for raids with unique vendors and buffs is amazing. Give players thousands of assets, the ability to rotate, resize and recolor everything in existence and multiple base building options and see what they can do. God I miss this game...",

This meant that even once you had gotten through your gauntlet of attunement, you barely had anyone to play with. Every server had like one option and if that slot was full there basically wasn't anyone to play with.\n\nSo all the average gamers were hardstuck and not even allowed to go wipe to bosses from what I remember. And then none of the good players could try the content as there were to few players left to raid with.\n\nDungeons being easier and attunement not being a thing would have helped it have a chance I think. But you basically had .5% of the playerbase doing anything at end game. Still my favourite raiding and dungeon game ever after they fixed it and it's a total shame it never got to be what it deserved due to shitty leads.",

Iirc for one of the dungeons, the timer to reach silver was 75 minutes. Imagine running a 60+ minutes \"speedrun\" of a single dungeon just as a single part of a humongous quest chain. Attunements are fine and dandy, I'm even in favor of them, but most of it was just so disjointed in addition to being far longer than even the Onyxia or Karazhan attunements from WoW.",

Meaning, you already have a team thats been working in 2-4 week cycles where they can develop a new gameplay experience and launch it. This is not easy, and takes a whole dedicated team that needs to be spun up and operating before launch.\n\nProblem is, this is pretty anti-thietical to the traditional game development process, where everyone crunches for months before launch, and the only focus is the big deadline. I work in software, its the difference between an Agile and Waterfall style of development. Its really hard to shift from one to the other, and its really hard to try and have both styles developing in tandem. So many companies don't prepare for this before launch.\n\nI think it comes down to a leadership problem, so many traditional game companies have been pushed into building games as a service because their publisher says thats what makes money, and what you get is a rushed out mediocre product that can't change or pump out content fast enough to keep up with players.",

It creates a situation where the game can only be successful long-term if it's successful *short-term*, and any lack of immediate success just causes the entire house of cards to collapse in on itself.  There's generally very little room for a game that has less success to turn things around because a company doesn't want to keep pouring money into something where the return on investment is questionable.\n\nOf course, it doesn't help that a lot of these games completely over promise what they'll be able to deliver.  I've seen so many MMOs, for instance, claim they'll have content updates every one or two months when they can't even meet their initial release date or even deliver on their launch promises.  Or there are the ones that just completely lie about what they have ready to go post-release, something they fail to realize is going to hurt customer satisfaction.  Though, I guess if your game's post-launch success depends on those launch day figures, why not go for broke?",

It launched badly, it had some support patches, they had a skeleton crew investigate if they could overhaul it, presented their pitch and it was declined. \n\nAs much as EA could have thrown a pile of money at Anthem Next, I can't see how it would have ended up as a good result that would put the whole project into a great thing. Even a full sequel with no ties to the first game is hard to see working, it's not like they had something like Destiny1 to build upon. Draw a line under it. \n\nSimilarly after Visceral/Project Ragtag, I wonder whether they've got a mandate to be more predictable in their projects, and if they have gone off the rails, aren't well run and don't have a clear route to success they get canned. As much as people moan about EA killing their game they're attached to, AAA isn't the place to screw around. They're focusing on their proven formulas.",

I'm not even a developer, but I do some very light dev/coding projects, and had a really shitty experience with a manager-led project.\n\nAbout a year ago, I was the lead of a project to basically spruce up how we do these particular reports. Long story short, people hated it because they hated change, they hated that it added some restrictions (we were trying to clamp down on some free-form stuff and standardize), it kept mysteriously breaking for reasons we couldn't find out, and it put a ton of extra stress and burden on me, meaning it took me away from *other* things I needed to do. And the whole thing had been rushed from the start because we went from \"we're going to play with the concept\" to \"this is now a quarterly goal that we need to meet\" overnight. So after struggling with it after implementation for months, we scrapped it and went back to the status quo.\n\nAbout a year later (like 3-4 months ago from right now), I get this random email from one of my old team leads and this new higher up, and they are saying they are resurrecting the project. The new guy was like \"...wow, I had a look at this, and I'm amazed. This is going to save so much time and energy when we start using this again. I love what I see, I can't wait to get this up and running.\" And I just asked him WTF he was talking about? You're honestly just going to flip this thing back on despite the myriad of problems we had with it, and what's more, you're just going to dump all of those problems on me? We actually went back and forth with it quite a bit, and he kept persisting this was going to be a great change, a game changer, a time saver, etc.\n\nUltimately, it ended up quietly dying and fizzling out, as it should. I think what finally killed it was the fact we'd changed a bunch of our reports, meaning, I'd have to go and recode a lot of it, and that was still on top of the pile of bugs that were never fixed and the requirements never met.",

And the graphics need to be mind blowing realism.\n\nI think now we are seeing the failures of this. No Mans Sky is a great example of both over ambitiousness and lack of direction. I\u2019m excited to see more games like Disco Elysium and Outer Wilds that do one thing and do it really really well.",

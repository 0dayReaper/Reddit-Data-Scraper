Like, sure, there was a story about why you were going around solving these puzzles that connected to the philosophy and occasionally the way some of the secrets were hidden.  But for me is still often felt like I was just solving puzzles and then every once in a while I'd take a break from.puzzle solving to argue philosophy with a computer for a bit.\n\nI'd prefer story in a puzzle game to be more seamlessly integrated with the puzzles.  Either something like Portal, where the story is told primarily either through the environment or during gameplay, or Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn, or Case of the Golden Idol, where figuring out the story *is* the puzzle.  Talos Principle had great puzzles and interesting philosophy, but it mostly just felt like a puzzle game with this random side feature where I could take a break from the gameplay to be lectured in philosophy every once in a while.",

It would have been really awesome and unique if you had needed to get involved with the philosophy in order to complete the puzzles somehow.\n\nI don't even need the philosophy to be directly integrated into the gameplay, I just like it not feeling like a completely separate thing.  Portal's a good example of the game where the puzzles aren't directly connected to the story (the story explains why the puzzles are there but they're not tied to the story in the way that, say, Golden Idol's puzzles are), but you don't have to stop solving puzzles to experience the story.  It's just given to you through audio during or between puzzles.\n\n&gt;But doing it the way they did at least had the advantage of letting you get in to it as little or as much as you wanted. I would image a lot of people would have been turned off of the game if they were forced to engage with those things.\n\nI think given the way they tell the story, it's good that they make it optional, so you can choose to just not stop solving puzzles and ignore the story if you want.  I just think it would be even better if it were possible to experience the story without having to stop solving puzzles and read a bunch of text.\n\nBasically, this is a case where I think there are worse alternatives but I'm still not crazy about the way they did it.",

I don't see how Talos wouldn't be completely subverted by the story taking a more theatrical approach.\n\nPortal can have story develop as regular theatrical events (during, or more usually: between, puzzles) because it is inherently structured like a linear fps campaign. It's puzzle &gt; character event &gt; puzzle &gt; repeat. This gives Portal the sort of momentum that a theatrical approach demands to be excellent. \n\nThe story in the Talos Principle, on the other hand, absolutely hinges on a rpg-like dialogue interaction with Milton. To ask that it should happen during puzzles is like asking that you should be able to talk to characters in Skyrim during combat. This rpg-ish approach also tracks with the more open-ended exploratory design of the game, much unlike Portal. \n\nThat said, a lot of Talos's story is also given to you through audio. Whether from Elohim's musings or from Alex's audiologs. Both of those (and the QR codes pasted all over the puzzles) all form story arcs with recognisable beginnings, middle and climax.",

            "comment": "High hopes for this, the first was phenomenal. And the engine was probably the best I've ever experienced on PC - butter-smooth, looked beautiful, tons of options to tweak in the settings, and the game truly respects the players time by allowing you to fast-forward time, change walking or running speed and so on.\n\nI'm not the biggest puzzle-game fan but I really enjoyed the gameplay mechanics and puzzles of the first one. That's my biggest worry, are the new gameplay mechanics gonna be fun and different enough from the first? So far the gravity changing and portals aren't exactly innovative but seem fun and fitting enough.",

We'll see what they do with the speed there.  \nThe view bobbing looked a little strange in the trailer, but they said that is not final.",

There's something about solving it that's deeply depressing to me...*  \n*- This lad back in my youth wasn't allowed to play Tetris cause one of his uncles was killed in the war by the Red Army.*  \n*- Did i ever tell you about Chris Rea giving me a back massage with an oyster while i was butting heads with the terminal in the first game?*",

I don't necessarily play a lot of puzzle games, only the most popular ones like The Witness (and Braid), Myst, Talos Principle, the Portal games, Baba Is You, etc... but I really do love puzzles in games. It's cheesy, but it works for me on both a callback to the first game and also just a general question, like \"why do we like puzzles so much?\"\n\nI'm playing TotK right now and I'm loving it a lot more the BotW partially because the shrine puzzles just give me more pause, with all the building.",

Happy because I didn't miss out on it and managed to conquer almost all of its obstacles on my own. Heartbroken because I couldn't play it for the first time again and, of course, the (in some regards) devastating finality of the story it tells. \n\nMade big eyes when this was announced, and it's a total Day-1 buy for me. Talos Principle holds a special place in my heart and what I've seen so far about part 2 is uplifting.",

I love all room-based puzzlers lol, but this really looks like the first one to properly hit Portal 2 levels of polish.\n\nI do hope though that the \"Stars\" in this game are a bit more sensible. While all of the main puzzles were fantastic, some of the star puzzles were a bit... obtuse. \n\nIt's been a long time since I played it, but my favourite star puzzles were the ones where you knew *what* you needed to do, but *how* to do it was complex. For example, a puzzle where you can get to the standard end fairly easily, but then at the end there's an extra gate with a star behind it necessitating a much more complex solution to the same puzzle to get rid of the gate.\n\nSome of the star puzzles though were instead things like \"Smuggle a thing from another puzzle\", which while cool only works for me if you essentially know that's what your goal is. Not knowing *where* to get an item is pretty unsatisfying imo, but not knowing *how* to get an item is much more interesting.\n\nIt's a trap I see a lot of developers of these kinds of games fall into to try and increase difficulty, there were a few puzzles in Baba is You that had a similar issue where it was a case of not knowing what to do, as opposed to not knowing how to do it. \n\nEven though it's not particularly difficult, the Portal games are always my shining beacon of having very clear goals with all of the elements clearly presented to you, having the difficulty be in how you use those elements to achieve those goals.\n\nThe best puzzles are when the what is clear, but the how is extremely complicated.",

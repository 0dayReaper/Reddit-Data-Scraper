They both also had really engaging controls that leant well to making the games stick around in my mind.\n\nI honestly didn't know the both games were handled by the same publisher, but it makes sense now what I hear that. And that makes this game a must buy for me. This definitely looks like a more puzzle heavy Omno, and I  down for that.",

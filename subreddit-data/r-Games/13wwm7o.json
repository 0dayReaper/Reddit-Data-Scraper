And the farther you get into immersive sim territory, the worse it gets. \n\nMost companies trying to build them seem to either go defunct (Troika Games with Bloodlines 1 and Ion Storm - who made Deus Ex and Thief - deadly shadows) or shit the bed (CDProjekt with Cyberpunk 2077).  Or in some cases the designers get nervous breakdowns from excessive stress (Irrational Games - Bioshock series).\n\nAnd even if the game came out amazing there is no guarantee of success. Lots of people call Deus Ex the best game they ever played, but it didn't save Ion Storm. Prey (2017) is probably the most faithful, feature-rich and polished immersive sim ever made, but the sales numbers were disappointing.\n\nThe only series that was indisputable success is Bioshock, and even in that case Bioshock Infinite broke Ken Levine's brain and it had to be cut down in scale. He then let go most of his team to scale down the company and focus on smaller games.\n\nI can't even believe Nightdive Studios managed to finish the System Shock remake and it seems to be genuinely amazing. That game spent years in a weird development hell.",

Totally new team, working out their vision and then executing it with an understanding publisher. That took upwards of 5 years.\n\nI'm reasonably sure that VTMB2 is a salvage job. Get it done, get it done cheap, get it done fast. (While obviously aiming to not review badly.) So try to ship in 24-36 months.\n\nThink Silent Hill: Origins. With Silent Hill: Origins, after Climax LA were removed from the project, Climax UK led by Sam Barlow took over. Barlow had one week to write the story. About 9-11 months to develop the game with access to the original team's assets. Expensive pre-rendered cutscenes created by the previous team were forced to be included, with new dubbing.\n\nIMO, Paradox want a product on shelves as soon as possible to recoup the investment on Hardsuit's disaster.\n\n&gt;VTMB2 is facing the exact same problem as the KOTOR remake, there's very few studios capable of making a game on its scale.\n\nThe thing about the KOTOR remake is that it has its scope defined by the original game. Bloodlines 2 has the luxury of being able to rescope to what they can deliver, not what they  should deliver.\n\n&gt;Rumors are that the game has been given to The Chinese Room, and I am not sure they have the experience to pull it off.\n\nThere's a series of emails in Vampire the Masquerade Swansong about Second Inquisition agents investigating a \"false lead\" called \"Brighton\", and they're frustrated by the lack of communication, and frustrated at not being allowed to explain to people down the chain why the lead is false.\n\nIt could be a complete coincidence, and the agents refer to Brighton as an individual, but The Chinese Room is a studio located in Brighton. I think the evidence for TCR is weak. I don't rule it out, but it's more likely a studio that has recently shipped games that could convince Paradox they can deliver.\n\nIt could be Saber, it could be Sumo Digital. But it's probably someone out of left field. I suspect we'll know the truth in the near future, because if they're aiming for an early 2024 release, they'll have to re-announce the game soon.",

It sucked.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever was completed by a completely different team at Gearbox, who stitched together 3d Realm's work.\n\nSingularity was given to a different team at Raven who spent about a year gutting the original concept of the game and retooling it, papering over the cracks with audio logs. Their job as to ship the game at any cost.\n\nSilent Hill: Origins was rebooted by Climax UK, but they were forced at gunpoint to use FMV cutscenes made for by the American team, and they were ultimately pressured to reuse a lot of other materials because they had about 9 months to make a Silent Hill game.\n\nWhen things went belly up with Star Wars Battlefront 3, Free Radical's assets were given to Rebellion, who were already working on the PSP version of Battlefront 3. That's why the PSP game has a few prerendered cutscenes created by Free Radical in it. It was an attempt to salvage what they could from Free Radical's expensive fiasco.\n\nEA handed the assets from Project Ragtag (Visceral's botched Star Wars game) to another team at EA and told them to make an open world game with them, then cancelled the game because it didn't fit into their release schedule.\n\nWhen I talk about salvage jobs vs a cathedral, it's not about how many assets you use. It's about time. If you have 5 years, you can lay the foundations, plan, scope properly. Rebooting someone else's game in 4-5 years is way different to doing it in 1-2.\n\nThe new team took over on Bloodlines 2 in early 2021. That means that at the time of writing they have been working on it for just over 2 years. And the CEO is saying it is \"not impossible\" it will ship this year. That says a lot of things about how Paradox is approaching this project.\n\nSingularity is a [really good look at how this works](https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/3/5462994/singularity-two-years-to-make-a-mess-ten-months-to-clean-it-up), although they didn't replace the entire team:\n\n&gt;With Singularity\u2019s enormous head count and history of failed deliverables, the eleventh hour deal struck with Activision was understandable: They gave us one last chance to land the plane, with conditions that made sense ... even if they were brutal on the team.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Complete control of the project was handed to the Marvel team, and there was a hard deadline of ten months. That's not ten months to finish the game, that's ten months to ship the game. Accounting for final processes such as certification, fabrication and distribution? We really had about seven months to do the actual work.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ten months is just a few days shy of eternity in the modern era of mobile and casual titles, but when you\u2019re handed the reins of a largely unfamiliar AAA project with vast scope, gameplay that openly defies console constraints, and subpar framerate on every platform? You may as well ask to have it wrapped up by lunch. The task didn't border on the impossible, it was impossible.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Marvel team\u2019s creative director \u2013 now project lead for Singularity \u2013 spent significant time modifying the story, pulling out scenes that were technically challenging and salvaging existing plot points and voice acting wherever possible. The game was slated to contain several set piece moments of grand-scale use of the Time-Manipulation Device that was supposed to be central to the game's mechanics, but they were so time-consuming to create and so difficult to make fun that only a hint of our earlier intentions made it into the shipping version of the game.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This was just the story of the singleplayer content. There was a separate group of folks working feverishly to create multiplayer. This was in the heyday of Modern Warfare-style online combat, which required a vast amount of time to tweak to perfection if you entertained even the slightest hope of making a competitive product.",

It was just about unprecedented.\n\nThen a similar thing happens with the KOTOR remake. It's not quite as egregious because the replacement dev was the original's parent company (so there's at least some personnel continuity, probably) and it also had the upheaval happen well before the original release date (Bloodlines 2 was indefinitely delayed *after* missing it's original release date, ugh). \n\nSo I wouldn't call it common just yet. It's in the \"it's weird that that happened twice\" stage. To be fair, I do think probably projects like these probably get canned a lot. Just they get canned before they're announced.",

Through ~2018 they were still primarily doing Mac and Linux ports of games, with the occasional mobile port. Then they expanded, completely dropped the platforms they had focused on for decades, and switched to being almost exclusively a Switch and Playstation publisher plus developing their own games. If I had to guess it was part of a strategy to get acquired so the founders could cash out, and if so mission accomplished I guess. Too bad they torched their company's reputation in the process.",

Both times the publishers promised bonuses that they torpedoed just because they could. With New Vegas they missed the bonus by a single point on Metacritic, despite the biggest (and often *only*) complaint being excessive bugs, which is absolute bullshit since QA was the publisher's responsibility. After years of not being properly compensated, Obsidian lost some key talent and never really recovered. It's why modern Obsidian is mostly just mediocre with occasional moments of brilliance.",

It's obviously murky subject that will vary by jurisdiction, but I would think there's a case to be made for false advertising under the Fair Trade Act, as well as the various common law claims.",

Emhyr is an already established character so you can't really just \"model\" him after someone famous (unless that someone famous looks exactly like his depiction in books/other media).\n\nThat's one of the downsides on basing your game on another source material, you probably want to stick to it when it comes to character/world design and can't go wild.",

People were down with Theodore Logan and Neo, they just thought Keanu himself was a joke.\n\nThen after that he went through a few years of being \"Sad Keanu\"\n\nand now finally people are both respecting his work *and* liking him as a person.\n\nI'm not really arguing with you or anything just pointing out that being genuinely liked by a wider audience still *is* a new thing for him, so it's not that surprising that he's... surprised by the reactions he gets.",

The roles he's famous for being stoic in *call* for being stoic, but if you check out something like Devil's Advocate you can see he really does know a bit of acting.\n\nNot that I particularly liked that movie, but Keanu did a bit more than standing around looking like a badass. Those are just the movies that made him famous, and they made him famous because that was right for the character and he did a good job of it.\n\nJust my personal opinion across the board",

Many critics tend to think of him as a \"bad\" actor because he historically doesn't have the range of someone like Daniel Day-Lewis or Meryl Streep, or what have you. BUT, in that narrow range where Keanu Reeves lives he's actually REALLY good. In recent years he's been more selective of his roles and seems to understand that about himself and that's what has lead to his resurgence as of late. \n\nThis is in opposition to the example used of Johnny Depp who is a bad \"good\" actor. He has a ton of range and often does very different and quirky characters but he doesn't do many of them all that well, it just looks more impressive cause we see so many different versions of him. \n\nThe article explained it much better than I did but that's the gist of it. \n\nAnd here's the article if anybody is curious:  [https://observer.com/2018/09/film-crit-hulk-keanu-reeves-and-good-acting/](https://observer.com/2018/09/film-crit-hulk-keanu-reeves-and-good-acting/)",

I'd really put the sad Keanu meme as one of the main reasons he started getting sympathy and respect",

The story has been denied by special effects staff themselves as an urban legend.[76] The story likely had its roots in a back-end deal Reeves made with the producers of The Matrix Reloaded, relinquishing his contractual right to a percentage of the earnings from the ticket sales. Reeves reportedly did so to allow producers the flexibility for an extensive special effects budget. The value of Reeves' forgone share of the ticket profits has been estimated at $38 million, which was added to the overall movie budget, rather than going directly to special effects.[77]\n\nHe still seems nice in other ways though.",

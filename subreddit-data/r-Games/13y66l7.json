And 13 never had regular balance updates like XV did\n\nAnd the game flow is pretty samey in XV. Play strong neutral character with good/easy 1 bar combos and maintain lead, or save up meter a bit and let your mid / anchor with strong max mode confirm / anti air leading to big damage for comeback.\n\nIn 13 I see much more air to air interaction, players utilizing way more guard cancels and rolls to get out of pressure and the combos as much as they get criticized for the length is much more stylish and expressive imo. Games are way high paced and tense too. Just look up Bala vs Madkof for reference, the hype is unmatched still to this day",

It can\u2019t quite keep up with my 3080Ti desktop but it\u2019s around the tier of a 3070. The M1 Pro is supposedly comparable to a 3060. \n\nThe problem is just most games don\u2019t run natively.

According to the post, this totals more than Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, and Activision combined.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because the company doesn't make or sell dedicated gaming consoles or have a major game development division, most of these profits come from third-party games on the App Store. Apple gets revenue by taking a 30% cut from all purchases made on the App Store.\n\nIt's possible that Apple make more profit from games than any other company in the world, and a big reason why is because they barely spend any money on gaming. They let mobile game companies do the hard work, and then much of that 30% cut they take is easy profit.\n\nThe Mac gaming community has been tiny for decades, and it would take a ton of investment and many years to change that. That investment would cut into Apple's gaming profit, not grow it.\n\nWhat motivation do they have to change when they're already making a staggering amount of easy money?",

Sure it starts at 600$ but knowing Apple they have like 50% margin on it.\n\nApple is kind of the only company I could see enter gaming in a big way as a new player (which we don't have since the Xbox arrival).\n\nThey are becoming a service and software company more and more too and like streaming, games go in this strategy. Especially when you consider they are already making a shit ton of money from games. They're estimated to be the 3rd company in gaming in revenue after Sony and Tencent. 1st in profit (they are very high margin their revenue is the iOS cut on games)",

Coming from someone who bounced off the game back when it launched on PS4, it\u2019s incredible seeing it superbly optimized for Mac.\n\nMy M1 Pro 16\u201d defaulted to running it at practically native resolution (3456 \u00d7 2234) at 30fps, and it\u2019s super smooth to control \u2014 especially on trackpad! It barely got warm throughout my play session, and even if I have a Deck to take advantage of cross-save, I\u2019m quite excited to play on such a gorgeous screen.\n\nI\u2019m certain if I play around with the settings it\u2019ll be easy to hit 60, but I\u2019m just super happy to have such a huge game on macOS. The revamped intro is a lot of fun, and I\u2019m excited to see what 7 years of updates has done to this game!\n\nFingers crossed that WWDC actually talks about Metal 3 and hopefully encourages more developers to port to Mac. Would love to see Marathon come back to Mac!",

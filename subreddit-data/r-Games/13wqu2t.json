Almost every major large scale RPG you have people that give universal praise and acclaim for titles that are very good, but ultimately have pretty noticeable flaws.\n\nIts important to not make appreciation for a title blind you to its flaws, because ultimately every game is flawed and many of which in fairly major ways that you just forgive. But as a reviewer you have to appreciate not everyone will forgive the things you do.\n\nLike, almost none of the TOTK reviews work for me because I do not forgive the rather shocking writing quality in the game. Almost no review mentioned that the writing quality is extremely rough and has enough plot holes to make 40K a little jealous. Is it going to be a problem for most people? Absolutely not, I appreciate that I have a harder time suspending disbelief then most. But its something that a reviewer really may want to be able to appreciate and address for example.\n\nAnd I appreciate that a lot of people will disagree. But no game is perfect, but that is just an opportunity to critically examine and find out how to continue to iterate and improve and not just rest on the laurels and decide because its really good there's no need to look at it critically.",

Also the fact that once Link finds this out, a huge plot point in the story, no one but one NPC will react to it. Leaving you with so much redundant dialogue on top of the already redundant dialogue from the 4 dungeon quests",

In TotK you can find them without really even trying and because of how easy finding them is you're likely to find out information that the other main quests would suggest you're really not supposed to know until later. \n\nIn BotW the memory locations corresponded to the memories themselves, in TotK the placement is far more arbitrary.",

From a performance standpoint, it\u2019s pushing the Switch to its absolute limits, with moments of slowdown that remind me a lot of the PS3 era. \n\nDesign-wise, I think there are too many currencies and they get confusing, specifically the fact that there are these Poes (which feel really unnecessary) and the path to upgrading your battery. A simpler system for that would\u2019ve gone a long way. \n\nAlso, combat is really frustrating. Sometimes I cut through loads of dudes without an issue and other times they turn into sponges that can one shot me. It\u2019s really hard - maybe impossible - to determine why. More often than not, I actively avoid enemies since fighting them rarely is worth the effort. \n\nBut on the flip side, we have a beautiful open world that actively guides you from point to point in a way that feels organic (think, \u201coh cool, what\u2019s that smoke coming from?\u201d Or \u201cwhat\u2019s that tower?\u201d), but that\u2019s something we had in BOTW. The music is gorgeous. The story is surprisingly heartfelt, and the characters are fun and varied. \n\nThe openness of how to solve puzzles and get places is better than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced, too. I love that I can be in a random cave and instead of having to walk around to find the exit, I can simply jump through the ceiling.",

Botw/Totk has an invisible level scaling mechanic where each time you kill an enemy it adds to a counter which determines what grade of enemies to spawn. The act of killing Blue enemies will cause more Black ones to spawn, and so on. You're actively penalised for engaging in combat.",

With better combat, a little more story work, and some consolidation of currency and resources it'd be almost perfect.

Tears of the Kingdom is a marvelous game, but I doubt I'll want to replay it. Replay value is subjective and not inherently necesscary, but the main strength of this game is uncovering new things.

A link to the past had 1 item useable at a time which turned into Ocarina of Time having 3 items attached to C Buttons. Iron boots was fixed in the remaster. ToK did nothing to improve BotW constant menuing and infact made it worse. There's no need to have 50+ throwable weapons/arrow combinations that I have to sift through. Even after sorting to \"most frequently used\" it's still tedious. Now apply that same tedium to every  interaction and it bogs down the gameplay  significantly. I don't think anyone is asking for Elden Ring level of engagement such as never pausing during combat but there is absolutely a middle ground and several very easy suggestions Nintendo could have done to not make everything so cumbersome and instead Nintendo chose....nothing.",

I can attach a bomb to my shield, initiate a shield surf to launch myself high into the air and kill everything via bow aiming slo-mo, throw a sword then use rewind to have it come back to me and hit a bunch of enemies who are rushing me or I can build a death trap out of some spare parts. And that's just *some* of the possibilities. Or is that your issue? There's just too many choices and you're not sure what to do?",

I thought Autobuild might help, but it requires so many materials I can never use it.\n* Want armor sets that have cool effects like the glider suit? Go do this or go collect that but do it 10 more times in locations all over the map.\n* Don't get me started on the inventory and quick access  (i.e., holding and dropping, cooking, using items).\n\n...and just so many other lifeless tasks. It started taking too much of my time to do pointless things.\n\nThe bosses were cool, but there was no depth to the game other than being a creative sandbox.

I think that, to a certain extent, being overloading with content is great for players who go at the game for a handful of hours over the course of several months, or even YEARS, but it's a design principle that, like much of BotW and TotK, clashes hard with the philosophies of the series as a whole, and leaves a poor taste.",

It was really satisfying to not only feel like you're really pushing your luck down there, and then getting rewarded by some of the cool things you can find. However, I personally found that as time went on, the Depths became a drag, for a variety of reasons.",

While the sense of wonder is there on occasion, I didn\u2019t feel it as often as I did with BotW.

Whether you're in the Sky, on the Surface, or in the Depths, there's always some very simple way to get high up, and soar over the entire map without interacting with the world itself. Having to trek across Hyrule on foot was the best part of BotW, and TotK essentially removes that exploration wholesale by making flight, diving, and fast-travel points that set you high up, so plentiful. And with most high-profile landmarks moved closer to civilization, or tied to easily-discoverable quests, there's really no need to explore either. The world feels more empty than it ever did in BotW.",

The sheer amount of traversal advantage and access they give you to new locations in a seamless way is such an absolute joy.\n- Dragon Tear discoveries I can't really understand seeing as a chore. They add a great sense of discovery to the world and the cutscenes look stellar. They tie together exploration/traversal and backstory in a pretty cool way.\n- Upgrades that require heavy grinding are completely optional, are not guilted into, and are not at all paced for grinding either. You get enough \"necessary\" armor upgrades to other core pieces of kit with resources you acquire in generous amounts just by playing the game.\n- Since when is a diamond a bad reward? A huge rupee boon in probably the best rupee economy in the series, or a major fuse advantage, or usable in crafting champion items. That being said...most caves I've been in are in-and-out of in 5-10 minutes or less, and reward me with either a Bubbulgem (useful for acquiring the best collectibles in the game) or a Misko treasure (also some of the best collectibles in the game) or a shrine discovery super regularly.\n- The nice thing about the armor sets with cool effects is that you only need one of the items to start having a *very* noticeable effect. If you want all three parts...you only need to do it 3 times (very different from 10 lol). With the wing suit, it's fun every time.",

The health scaling in the game is awful, everything oneshots you if you have vanilla level armor. The upgrade provide absolutely insane defense, something like 90% damage reduction. And you need like 100 of a single mineral to upgrade a set. The balance in all these things is super over the place and frustrating as hell, easily the thing I hate the most about the game.",

Cuts down damage dramatically on its own and is more than capable at that level of handling much of the game's toughest enemies.\n\nOr you can upgrade your hearts by shrine orbs.

And if you don't want them, you can skip them and just use them as fast travel points after the first few.\n\nThe criticism of shrines carries over from BotW - they feel lifeless and \"game-y\". Yes, they present (mostly) interesting gameplay challenges, but that's *all* they provide. Speaking personally, when I'm in a shrine, the fact that I am in a puzzle, in a videogame, designed by a designer for my amusement, is unignorable, and that really kills the immersion and feeling of being a hero on an adventure for me. It's like, imagine if Portal didn't have Glados, and it just presented a series of test chambers for you to solve - that game would be 100x worse.\n\nA youtuber named Ceave did a great video on this a couple years ago that delves into the topic a little more deeply. [I'd recommend giving it a watch if you're interested in understanding the issues people have with shrines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WHgHx12eI0). He also has a video on [why he fell out of love with the durability mechanic that I think is fantastic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRIPhCOW5so)",

It's more about spending time trying to build and angle components when using ultrahand. Rarely did I need recall or ascend unless the shrine explicitly called for it through a deliberately placed platform or giant gear. No big deal as I started skipping them, but then came across shrines that require you to carry the crystal to some shrine location to unlock the fast travel point.\n\n&gt;Sky Towers are phenomenal\n\nYou go to a sky tower, unlock said sky tower doing some short generic quest, and now there are no longer any incentives to traverse around on foot within that area. You realize the rewards are seldom worth it, so you start flying everywhere.\n\n&gt;Dragon Tear\n\nThey're locations that are scattered around the map and the condition for each of these locations is to simply run up and loot an item - it's shoehorned in for the sake providing additional lore through cutscenes and is generally a monotonous time sink.\n\n&gt;Upgrades that require heavy grinding are completely optional\n\nThings like having a larger capacity battery is what makes the game fun. Getting these upgrades is an abysmal experience. I would farm the relevant ore, wait for a blood moon, and then teleport to Sky Island/Depths Below Great Plateau for processing, and then repeating by waiting for the next blood moon.\n\nEither that or exhaust all your weapons or materials to reach a generic mini boss that would drop larger materials. Realistically, if you played the game normally, you wouldn't come close to the max upgrades that make the game fun by the time you beat it.\n\n&gt;Since when is a diamond a bad reward?\n\nWhen I see an enigmatic location that's oddly isolated and captivating in its placement, where I make an ambitious effort to travel to said location using all the tools at my disposal, it's dispiriting to find a cluster of rare ores or a group of fairies. Sometimes you find an old map in the sky,  leading you down into the depths, only for it to be recycled armor or weapons that end up breaking. Not a fan of that, but maybe that's just me.\n\n&gt;The nice thing about the armor sets with cool effects......you only need to do it 3 times (very different from 10 lol). With the wing suit\n\nIt's hyperbole for the sake of illustrating the game design as a whole. It might be okay a few times, but that's the reward structure for most things in the game, some more egregious than others.",

We probably won't see eye to eye on a lot of this stuff and that's fine.\n\n&gt;because the set pieces are designed in a way that make the solution very obvious.\n\nI actually agree with this, that shrines can be inconsistently designed like this. It's signal-to-noise ratio in puzzle designing, and a lot of BotW/TotK's shrines have too much signal and little noise.\n\nThat being said, there are also a lot of shrines that really impress me in this regard, and some that start with a similar setup from another shrine (or rock moving thing) and then switch it up on you.\n\nI'd be more critical of these if the sheer act of executing on a lot of these wasn't fun. But it is, so I give it a pass. For example, I walked into a shrine where there was a bunch of runways and a wing and wheels and such. I knew exactly what I had to do because I had done it before. But the wing in this game is so dang satisfying that I didn't mind. Shrine breaks are also super fun.\n\nRe:Towers, This goes back to the intrinsic vs. extrinsic reward thing. I do wish the puzzles to entrance were more interesting like they were in BotW, but I'm still not tired of the joy of leaping out into the air (it's like a Super Mario Galaxy planetoid jump on steroids), seeing the new sky islands in reach, and going there. Or taking out a wing in midair and using that leap to efficiently fly to my next ground destination.\n\nRe:Tears, Once again, will probably go back to intrinsic vs. extrinsic. Because I find the traversal in the game so satisfying, venturing out to these locations is often fun in itself. On top of that, however, tears also are usually placed near towns or other major quests/points of interest, so traveling to them often helps you discover new locations in a chain reaction.\n\nRe:Upgrades, while I do like having a larger battery pack, sometimes the most fun challenges in the game are when you're trying to strategically use your battery in the smartest and most efficient ways. That battery upgrade process sounds...rough. But I've gotten three upgrades to it already and needed zero grinding and zero blood moon respawns. And so far, that extra full cell has been more than enough for virtually *anything* in the game.\n\nRe:caves/diamonds. Yeah this is just an intrinsic vs. extrinsic reward part. I haven't really found a cave that seemed so significant that it mismatched the reward I got. But I've enjoyed virtually all of them all the same.\n\n&gt;It might be okay a few times, but that's the reward structure for most things in the game.\n\nI'd argue the reward structure is, \"give you stuff you'll really notice and feel rewarded for just by doing the basics. Give you some extra bonus stuff if you had fun with those last challenges. Give you diminishing returns if you want to grind for even more stuff down that path.\" Which I think is fair.",

The depths are cool but from an aesthetic standpoint its all kind of the same, which makes it not so interesting to explore. So all that's left is the main overworld, which I've already spent 250 hours exploring in BotW. I get that they added new stuff to it and there's certainly a lot more content, but I personally love the visual rewards of exploration, e.g. discovering some incredible view or senic vista, and that's something that really hasn't happened to me much while playing this game.",

I completely understand why they did it if the goal was to preserve te weapon degradation feature from botw and I think it is an improvement from the previous game as far as the overall experience goes, but I just can't help brainstorming ideas on how to make the process smoother (if only because there's a slim possibility that it would actually get implemented officially or unofficially to make the game feel better in subsequent playthroughs). \n\nI just can't think of any substantial solutions that is both intuitive and isn't going to burden the player with more menuing. Maybe have a dedicated NPC that can suggest optimal combinations in inventory and autobuild them? Maybe pre-craft combo arrows so you can have a stock of them in-hand before a fight?",

Why isn't that reused for your weapons and shields? Let me select my stuff with a wheel rather than mashing all the way through the options every time. MH solves the problem of \"too many items for the wheel\" with... multiple wheels! It's great.\n\nIt's yet another great Nintendo game plagued with bizarre UI choices that everyone is giving a pass because they like the rest so much.",

In BOTW you basically end up with more weapons than you know what to do with, so durability isn't really an issue. In TOTK the base durability for most gear is pretty weak as well as the base damage, so you're forced to engage with the problems of the system more (which basically amounts to bad UX) for what amounts to gear that doesn't really feel much more durable than the BOTW equivalents. So essentially it's putting lemon juice on a paper cut.\n\nThere's a few clear cut ways they could fix this, the most obvious being a menu and no other changes, but for some reason nintendo didn't do this pretty obvious route?",

It's very much possible to just farm equipment on loop without having doing much combat except for certain minibosses like Lynel, lower level mobs like Lizalfo and Bokoblin camps could be avoided entirely or bypassed with stagger + steal equipment + run away. Or just mark where certain weapons spawn and keep going back to collect them.\n\nBy locking half the piece of equipment required for good gear behind defeating an actual enemy, it means players actually have to do old fashion combat which I imagine was the intent. The problem with that is it creates an entire new set of problems with the need for more menuing.",

Swapping weapons, shields, bows, or attaching things to arrows - whatever the case, there is just too much pause in the action.\n\nWeapon durability - As a concept, weapons wearing down over time and breaking is fine, the problem is that is simply happens too often. Weapon durability in these games is like trying to kill a car with a twig. The Master Sword, the sword of swords, breaks after killing 2 Silver versions of monsters. Weapon durability needs a serious buff.\n\nArmor - There are too many sets, and you need way too many resources to upgrade them. So much so that you'll almost never come across the amount resources needed naturally. The abilities they offer could have easily been combined so that there are less sets.\n\nUpgrades and Leveling - If I want to expand my inventory, get a new heart container, or upgrade a piece of armor, why do I have to engage in a cut scene every time? When you engage with Hetsu or a Great Fairy, you have to select you want to upgrade something, choose the item you want to upgrade, confirm that selection, skip a cut scene, get a prompt that the item upgraded, choose to upgrade again, then choose the item you want, watch the cut scene again, etc. It's exhausting. It is just simply bad user experience and there is no argument you can make that justifies this interaction.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is still very fun and I enjoyed exploring Hyrule and it's 4 regions again, but there is a lot that can be streamlined or reworked to make it even more enjoyable.",

Healing items assigned to a single Estus flasklike button with real time implciations, weapons being manually sorted to go on an automatic rotation when broken or a radial quick menu with pre-registered clothing sets would help a lot.",

Swapping weapons, shields, bows, or attaching things to arrows - whatever the case, there is just too much pause in the action.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Weapon durability - As a concept, weapons wearing down over time and breaking is fine, the problem is that is simply happens too often. Weapon durability in these games is like trying to kill a car with a twig. The Master Sword, the sword of swords, breaks after killing 2 Silver versions of monsters. Weapon durability needs a serious buff.\n\nHit the nail on the head with these two points.\n\nThis shit is a fucking drag and a total downer.\n\nDo you know that moment in games, where you go down a corridor away from the objective and find \"Super Health Pot IV +Dmg Boost VI\" or some shit and think \"oh, better save this. I'll need it later\" and end up finishing the game with all of them unused?\n\nThis is that on steroids. I've slooooooowly killed hundreds of high health mobs, simply because durability is so incredibly unreliable on everything in the game.\n\nMy last nitpick is to do with the overall sandbox really. BotW was kind of cool because most of the tools at your disposal were pretty diverse, you had the stop time + store momentum thing, the bombs. This time round it feels like everything (with exception to the rise ability) is based around fusing, Which has limitless possibilities sure, but for people who don't care about crafting - the game is a thoroughly worse experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add - I don't understand the mentality behind \"it's good because it forces you to mix up what you use\" - ? Like what, Big heavy swing weapon A, B or C, or small swing light weapon A, B or C?",

Why can't I just keep shooting the same arrow until I want to turn it off?\n\n&gt;Weapon durability \n\nTBH this continues to not bother me. And with all the doohickeys I can attach to weapons, it makes it feel a little more fresh with \"lesser\" weapons not feeling as inferior and useless. \n\nI DO wish the game actually gave us more values on weapons as to understand where durability, for instance, stood on a new weapon, a used weapon, etc. Having to keep tabs on how many times I've shot a bow, swung a weapon, etc is tedious.\n\n&gt;Armor \n\nI don't have an issue here. The game is survival at its core, so upgrading everything is probably not what you're \"supposed\" to do as opposed to making choices on it.\n\nHaving said that, it would be nice if resources were a little more predictable. Full disclosure: I'm definitely duping diamonds because I ain't grinding rupees in this game. Probably won't update my game until I can dupe every RNG item I can't reliably go find.\n\n&gt;Upgrades and Leveling\n\nAt least Hestu is funny (although, they probably could have given us some variations on dances kind of like Kirby's level completion dances or like Smash winning poses). The fairies are annoying and pretty irredeemable after you upgrade the first 3 pieces of armor (of the 8-15 you need to do at a given trip).\n\nLastly, I do want to say, I appreciate how the game appears to have all of the old features of the last game available to discover. I just googled that, apparently, I can find Hero's Path in game (and here I was scared it would be behind a paywall again).\n\nGreat feedback tho.",

Most of the issues i had with Breath of the Wild are still there though and personally i'm less forgiving this time around. I think the game is probably \"better\" than BotW but i think i enjoyed my time more with that than Tears of the Kingdom.\n\nFor reference i have played BotW for 135 hours total with 2 separate playthroughs and gotten all shrines atleast once, i have played Tears for 60 hours and have about 100 shrines completed.",

Sky towers and vehicles you can build basically trivialize the classic overworld. So I don't think they really expected players to just be ok with the same overworld, they expected them to do the loop of overworld &gt; tower/flight &gt; sky islands &gt; dive into depths &gt; repeat. Whereas in BotW the loop was overworld &gt; climb mountains / towers &gt; glide down &gt; repeat.\n\nWhile I think it was a pretty unique approach to this problem, I agree that it didn't hit the same highs as BotW.",

At the time, it felt like the weakest 3D Zelda title.  Still a good game, just not as good as the others.  I consider TP, MM, and OoT to be the three greatest games ever though, so yeah.\n\nI should go back and play it again.  I recently replayed TP, OoT, and WW.  WW definitely didn't hold up as well as I expected it to, I'm wondering if on a replay, SS would move above it.  I really didn't like the motion control sword gameplay, it still felt so finnicky and not precise.  Using it for controlling the bug and some of the other items was fine, but I wanted my sword to work exactly when I needed it to, and the wiimote didn't deliver.  I seem to recall the dungeons not being nearly as expansive as TP or MM, but solid.  And one of them had a cool mechanic that I won't spoil (the desert one).  I hated the companion, Fi, with a passion.  There's one boss fight that is repeated several times that I also disliked, maybe just because of how reused it became.  The game felt far too linear and each region was entirely disconnected from the others, which hurt. \n\nSo yeah, definitely a solid game still, and I think much improved with the switch release.  But I don't think it'll ever crack what I consider to be the masterpieces of TP, MM, and OoT.",

There are more engaging gameplay loops, like the ones mentioned above, than finding a locked door, finding the associated puzzle, and backtracking.\n\nHaving recently replayed OoT and MM, I found that the reason the dungeons felt so much bigger was because of all the backtracking you ended up doing, largely in part to those small keys. However, puzzle density is about the same between TotK and OoT, per dungeon, imo.",

They also didn't bother revamping their mechanics that clash with the inclusion of such an open world like the weapon upgrade system, NPC quest progression or the fact that you 'Pinwheel' entire areas if you do them in the 'wrong' order. Why build an open world if you have an intended path through it anyways?\n\nIn BotW/TotK meanwhile the open world *is* the game and they literally reworked 25 years worth of established mechanics to make sure they work in tandem with that open world",

                            "comment": "For me for example, it's how unrewarding exploration was in BotW. The only meaningful rewards were armor sets and shrine orbs for me, because they weren't a consumable item I could find literally anywhere else in the world. Thus at some point (very quickly), I found myself absolutely *not* excited to see what is on top of that mountain over there, which I'd have to spend like 10 minutes climbing onto. Imagine doing so and being greeted with a Korok seed. Which actually makes up for the vast majority of such scenarios.\n\nI need tangible rewards, meaningful ones, ones that'll stay with me from the moment I get them, till the end of the game. Such as all of those wallet upgrades, hookshot, different shields and swords in previous Zelda games. Something that's preceded by a challenge/quest and is its ultimate reward, making things easier for me.\n\nExploration in BotW was the reward in and of itself. It was very much the case of \"it's the journey, not the destination\" type of thing, which doesn't have to be everyone's cup of tea. If pretty views are all you need, then sure, there is plenty of discovery in BotW, but otherwise there's little to none. Because the game is designed in such a way, as to let you do whatever you want, go wherever you want from the very beginning, no location will truly give you meaningful rewards. It's as if the entire open world is just one, singular location in a sense, instead of having all of those distinct zones on the map. And if you know what you're going to find everywhere, nowhere is a surprise.\n\nShrines are the closest thing to discovery, because in theory you don't know what awaits you, but in reality they're also designed with the same principle and end up being underwhelming. These are my feelings.",

When there are 1000 things to find, it quickly becomes tedious, uninteresting, and meaningless.\n\nIn ALttP, there are 24 heart pieces to find. There are 120 fucking shrines in BotW!\n\nIn ALttP, the secrets are you can upgrade your magic meter, find the ice rod, find the invisible cape, optionally upgrade your sword. In BotW there are ~75 secret armor pieces to find! They are technically all the same reward and you can't even use them in half the map less you freeze or overheat. Then there's the 100 hr grind to upgrade them all.\n\nWhen it comes to meaningful exploration, less is more and BotW/TotK doesn't seem to get that.",

                            "comment": "The BotW format is extremely frontloaded in terms of experiential novelty, by design or by nature of designing for pure freedom.  All major abilities are open from the start, and you can discover almost every major content type (memories, shrines, divine beasts/temples, Koroks) within the first 25-30 hours.  Each content type has subtypes, each of which are also readily apparent within a few to several encounters (ex: shrines broken down into tests/combat, blessings, and \u201cpuzzles\u201d).\n\nThere\u2019s no piece of armor, pickup, or ability that you can find that will change the game in a lasting and exciting way after the intro.  This is made worse by durability, as necessary as it may be for maintaining the core loop. The world itself is relatively static, as well.  \n\nTears, to its credit, is much better about maintaining that sustained sense of surprise over the course of the game (so far).  I feel like I\u2019m still learning new things even 40 hours in, both in good and bad ways.  The depths, the sky, and the fuse ability have definitely helped with that.  It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, though, as the main world is still the same, as is the general flow and loop.\n\nFor a game that keeps that sense of novelty for a better portion of the game, look at Mario Odyssey.  Mario\u2019s base moveset is robust with room to experiment, but you don\u2019t immediately have access to every possible item, ability, or map.  Moreover, less emphasis is placed on extrinsic value (reward) and more in the intrinsic value of play and surprise (the experience).  You are discovering new captures, enemies, objects to interact with, and ways to do things right until the end of the main story, and even several more hours past that.",

I crest a hill, and find *another* shrine with *another* puzzle where I have to tilt my Wii U pad around. \n\nTypically for me I prefer discovering meaty side quests, fun weapons and armour to deck my character in, hidden bosses that give me a reward I can use (health buff, a weapon etc), a new character interaction, or a fun dungeon/ruin/area with interesting lore.\n\nI need to just be engaged in the world a lot, whether the be via characters, plot, or combat.

Even if I explore a cave in TotK and I don't actually find anything particularly worthwhile, I still enjoyed my time because the act of exploring the cave was fun. Same with solving a shrine puzzle or fighting a mini-boss.\n\nIt's kind of the same in Elden Ring. In fact, most weapons I discover I'm Elden Ring I'll never use because they don't fit my build. Or some spirit ashes I'll never use. Crafting materials? I don't think I crafted a single item lol. \n\nBut I still went into every cave and crypt I found because I just liked playing the game, and those meant \"more game\" lol.",

No other games really wowed me or captivate my curiousity like these ones. \n\nIn souls, I love the games, and I love exploring in the games, despite the fact that I do not give a fuck about 99% of weapons or spells I will find. \n\nThis preference for intrinsic or extrinsic motivation seems to be the root of basically all debate about these games designs. To me, I felt like I was bad at games, I wasn't as good as my friends at them and I'd often spend more time trying to break the games than just playing them normally. BOTW really showed me that I was just playing the wrong games, and TOTK continues on with that. These games are built for curious people, they invite you into their worlds to just run about, wonder whats over that hill, who would rather jank a boss off the side of the map then fight as intended, and I find the core gameplay to just be enjoyable enough to be the reward. I get infinitely more joy from solving a cool puzzle than I do from getting a new fancy sword with cool powers. I just get some joy from actually seeing the game acknowledges the weird little thing I tried, or actually put something up there to reward me for venturing to the top of that hill. Its like the coins in mario, they dont really mean much but they just feel like a pat on the back for being adventurous.  \n\n\nAnd to some people they will see that as a lack of actual design in the game, but thats not the case at all. It is *hard* to find games that can really captivate me nowadays. Crafting a world that is simply a joy to exist in, gameplay systems that are a joy to play with, all that jazz is hard and quite hard to come by. Other praised open worlds like Ghost of Tsushima or Horizon bore me to death, they are pretty but all I see are typical design patterns playing them. I never got into grinding online games because I don't give a single fuck about progression in any of them, I just play them to enjoy the gameplay and thats that.  \n\nIts really just two opposite philosophies that appeal to different people. If they made a game that has all the intrinsic wonder *with* so many items and things to find, sure, cool. But realistically, that would just be taking away resources from designing what *I* value so much in these games. And it feels like 99% of AAA games take the other approach, so I'm glad these ones exist for people like me.",

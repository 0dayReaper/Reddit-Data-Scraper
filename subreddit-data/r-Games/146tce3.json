    "postText": "Hi, r/Games.  I'm super excited to announce Mearcair/System Pulse today.\n\nI'm a full time solo dev doing everything by myself to try to get by.  It's challenging but rewarding work.  I know there's a fair few bullet heavens now but I hope this one feels different to you.\n\nI invite you to check out the trailer and find out for yourself.\n\n* Trailer - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQw7PqLSKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zQw7PqLSKY)\n* Steam - [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457050/MearcairSystem\\_Pulse/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457050/MearcairSystem_Pulse/)\n\nKey Features:\n\n* Survive to the beat - The enemies, the weapons, and even the environment all happen in sync with the beat of the music.\n* Three-path Specialization - Weapons and accessories once acquired can be specialized in one of three paths(runes).  You can pick one main and one side path.  The main path you can fully upgrade and the side path you can only upgrade to rank 2.  Gain more build versatility and planning by leveraging and mastering the runes system.\n* Robots - The arena is overrun with robotic drones at the whims of Pulse, the twisted game show host.\n* Custom Music Tracks - Add your own music tracks with the help of a tool and sync the game to whatever music you want.\n\nThe planned release date is in early to mid 2024 on Steam currently.  I thank you for taking the time to look and I hope you'll let me know what you think.",

I would rather save that for after a few iteration loops of testing for a much better experience.\n\nedit:  I realize I didn't fully answer your question.  Yes there will be a demo.  I don't have an exact time for when it will be out but you can look forward to getting a taste even before the Next Fest that the game does enter.",

But the most important thing is to design systems to control the beat up front.  Make them flexible and easy to tie into and the rest of the design can usually handle its own logic from there.",

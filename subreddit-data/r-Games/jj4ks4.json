There's an abundance of evidence that the quality of work starts dropping off dramatically past the 8-hour point, and labor unions leveraged this evidence generations ago to negotiate sensible work hours and fair compensation for overtime. It's no coincidence that these norms are completely ignored in cases where organized labor is absent.\n\nI fear that it will take a headline-grabbing tragedy for game developers to be able to organize against these constant abuses of their mental and physical health.",

Sure disks still exist, but games get regularly patched and updated, and just because a game was playable enough to pass certification doesn't mean it is bug-free.\n\nMy guess is that there are still enough P0 game breaking bugs that they need to address, that they need to delay the launch.",

Remember the time when they were asked whether they would put microtransactions in their game and they said something like \"We leave the greed to others\" or something. Then later on they realised that if they had to make an online version of the game they needed to add microtransactions which just caused more unnecessary outrage for them. They keep on making promises they cant make and also try to maintain this image of themselves that they are the good guys or something and its getting really pissing off now. They should learn something from rockstar who also make ambitious games like them but the big difference is that they dont talk out of their arses half the time.",

Then - eventually, maybe - they get some rest. Or they're pulled into teams that already have begun the crunch for DLC. \n\nThat's what's so insidious about crunch and this whole development timeline. The game was never going to be ready in April (or September). Rather than setting a feasible release date first and enforcing internal benchmarks based on a more efficient / humane work schedule, CDPR set an early date they could not meet and then pushed the date back. That ramps up the pressure for crunch on the front end for the sake of saving face with consumers and investors, rather than setting expectations more realistically to begin with. \n\nThen the modern release structure is to also extend the work developers do at the back end. Going gold isn't the end of work on the game, but the start of work on patches. If the team had been in several months to a year of crunch even before going gold, the rush to patch ensures that they'll have to go from sprinting to sprinting. Then the three week delay is an even greater oh-shit moment, because now they have to sprint 3 more weeks after their months and months of sprinting. Just like with a human body that sprints too long, workers that crunch too long see huge deficits in physical and mental health as well as in productivity. Productivity begins to decrease with more hours worked after a few weeks, as exhaustion sets in and errors begin to compound. Lots of errors, high turnover, burnout - the doom cycle of crunch feeds on its workers for the illusion of productivity. \n\nAll of these subsequent crunch decisions ripple off of management's failures to adequately plan their development process, as well as a willingness to adjust deadlines with the assumption of crunch. That turns crunch into not just a last minute *sprinting* tool (which is what it's most useful for), but a deleterious process that utterly wears down the staff for months and months with constantly receding goal posts.",

                                    "comment": "It dealt with the way it handled saves. The game had 3 types of saves, an 'account' save (one for each person that played the game), a character save (since there were multiple characters you could play, the character save kept track of kills, etc.) and finally a 'normal' game save (kept track of what map you were on). They limited the game to have a total of 32 save slots for all three of those saves. Having lived in a communal house in the past I knew that there was the possibility that one or two people could use up all of the save slots with one 'account' save that then had 8 character saves (if they played each character to check them out) then each character save under the account save would have it's own separate save that had the progression information. It was a horrible save system. I kept bringing this up to my manager (I was working as a contractor for MS as a compliance tester) and while this technically didn't fail any test, I kept pushing that it would take one asshole in a shared living situation to make the game unplayable for everyone else in the house. My boss kept saying that wouldn't be an issue until I asked him what his living situation was like when he was in college. He thought for a moment then called Infogrames/Atari and told them that we were revoking gold status until they resolved the issue. They ended up changing it so that a single save would have character/map info combined. I expect they were very annoyed, but I am pretty sure I prevented a few 'friendly' fistfights lol",

The CEO of the mining company has an email that say the union leader has to be killed because he's a god damn commie. You can find where the union leader's assassin was hanging out, and he helpfully left notes behind to tell you the union leader was a great guy. There's also a subtle story point about the robots. Before the war people protested because the robots were taking jobs. After the war the robots helped the survivors by being vendors and walking around insulting people.",

[After which you hit diminishing returns, and then hit even sharper losses at 70+ hours.](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/26/working-more-than-50-hours-makes-you-less-productive.html)\n\nThe general issue being that the tired you are, the more mistakes you make. This is incredibly problematic in trades where safety is a concern and those are the kind of jobs that can see 10+ hour shifts on a regular basis.\n\nBut it's an issue in any industry where mistakes are a costly process to fix. In software - like gaming - making mistakes leads to bugs and poor quality control, which leads to you having to spend even more time fixing those bugs later on down the line. There is no scenario where working 50+ hour weeks long-term isn't going to inevitably end up in more expense.\n\nThe only reason companies resort to such stupidly insane levels of overtime is because the people making the most money from quick releases (upper management and shareholders) aren't held directly accountable in any meaningful way when a product releases in a shit state or when employers are overworked. They want a release ASAP because they just want to get their money and dip, damn the consumer or the people working shit conditions.\n\nThis is why unionising and worker rights are so important. But it's just as important for the employees themselves to stop working for an industry that has historically *never* cared for them. This is *not* a recent phenomenon, it's been a thing for decades.\n\nThe issue is gamers join the gaming industry because they're passionate about making games, rather than having an interest in programming or computer science. If you enjoy the process you'd enjoy it for other industries too, ones that don't abuse the fucking heck out of you.",

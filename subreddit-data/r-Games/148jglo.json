                    "comment": "Calling it a \"GB style game\" is even more misleading, though. This is by all intents and purposes a Gameboy game, it runs on a GB emulator and you can run it on original hardware with no modifications to the software nor the console. \n\nHeck, putting aside whether it's misleading, it's still far more interesting than you seem to give it credit for. Or at least I think it's interesting and cool. I wasn't exactly expecting them to produce and release a bunch of cartridges in this age either tbh.",

It's literal GBC code with bank swapping and all, software for the real hardware (Which runs fine in an emulator). There's nothing stopping me from flashing it to one of my many childhood flashcarts and playing it on a real device if I wanted.\n\nI can't argue when we're talking about a real GBC rom they've released here. That's awesome.",

Unless they got permission from Nintendo I could see them kicking up a fuss",

Not a lawyer, but it seems that, in a vacuum, emulation at the very worst currently in a legal grey zone. The thing that sends it into something to worry about is when it comes to distributing the BIOS files, which isn't needed to run GBC games. And even then, the emulator on the website only supports one specific game, and is not a general use one, so Nintendo would have trouble citing any damages to their bossiness.",

                    "comment": "The web emulator is just an emulator and the GBC rom it's executing fetched from their CDN is evidently legally obtainable code given they're the ones bundling their game rom with a web-playable experience.\n\nEmulation has always been legally gray in conversation. I mean, it's stopped none of us at any point and in a few actual legal cases, emulators have been dismissed as legal a few times too. But in this case, it's not even a question right? The emulator exists (And has hopefully been credited appropriately as per its licence) and the game is their intellectual property to load with the webpage. There isn't anybody to take legal action against here - it's their work.\n\nWhat I think will be most interesting is any bugs which may occur on physical hardware which don't due to improper emulation quirks (Like trying to read/write graphics data banks outside of vblank periods, and other fun goodies which could potentially occur on real hardware which may have not even been tested).\n\nDespite TheZZAZZGlitch's youtube channel primarily focusing on the awesome bugs, behaviours, exploitability and corruptions of Pokemon GB/GBC/GBA games - I'd love to see this rom compared and covered as well for any interesting behaviours should they arise.",

It's decent as a diversion, but it would be seen as short and basic, even at the release of the device. It doesn't really present a challenge, nor much enjoyment from success. The dialogue is also pretty cringe! At the end of the day, it's just an advertisement to make you think about McDonald's.",

It's basically a basic platformer with a neat skateboard mechanic but it didn't hold my attention for long.\n\nedit: Tried it again and the webpage works now without errors.",

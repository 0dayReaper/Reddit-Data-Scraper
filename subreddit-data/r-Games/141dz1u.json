Some technical issues occasionally break the immersion, but Frictional's approach to frightening and challenging you still offers its best thrills.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameMAG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/459/gamemag)** - *Russian* - [5 / 10](https://support.savethechildren.org/site/Donation2?df_id=5751&amp;mfc_pref=T&amp;5751.donation=form1)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is a step down from Amnesia: Rebirth. New release from Frictional Games is visually boring, lacks atmosphere and can get on your nerves with constantly teleporting stalker enemy.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Mark Delaney](https://opencritic.com/critic/1704/mark-delaney) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review-shellshocked/1900-6418075/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n&gt;Frictional Games reinvigorates the series that made it famous with its scariest game in years.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Hirun Cryer](https://opencritic.com/critic/3422/hirun-cryer) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is a bold new direction for the series, and it chiefly pays off with brilliant scares and disempowerment of the player. The bottlenecked level design can be frustrating though, as can the nature of do-overs with the beast hot on your heels.\n\n-------------\n\n**[God is a Geek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/111/god-is-a-geek)** - [Chris White](https://opencritic.com/critic/582/chris-white) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.godisageek.com/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is a heart stopping horror that constantly leaves you in fear, but it's all the better for it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Alessandra Borgonovo](https://opencritic.com/critic/3960/alessandra-borgonovo) - *Italian* - [6.5 / 10](https://it.ign.com/amnesia-the-bunker/202885/review/amnesia-the-bunker-la-recensione)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is a more guided experience than it claims, where ingenuity and improvisation are replaced by tedious resource management.\n\n-------------\n\n**[New Game Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/405/new-game-network)** - [Ben Thomas](https://opencritic.com/critic/2653/ben-thomas) - [76 / 100](https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2677/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker has a fantastic dynamic involving light and power management, as you explore an atmospheric WW1 bunker and avoid a monster with a keen sense of hearing. Despite a lack of puzzles, a bland story, and a few monster quirks, it packs enough good horror to keep players on edge.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer)** - [Ted Litchfield ](https://opencritic.com/critic/9234/ted-litchfield-) - [93 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is an essential horror game and an inspired next step for the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil)** - [Bruno Ribeiro](https://opencritic.com/critic/7992/bruno-ribeiro) - *Portuguese* - [80 / 100](https://psxbrasil.com.br/analise/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Even without revolutionary additions, Amnesia: The Bunker does not disappoint in the horror department. The darkness of the underground is really scary and fills you with anxiety, but, despite not being something necessarily negative, the new game in the franchise brings more of the same without being especially striking. For lovers of the genre, however, the experience is quite satisfying, and it will be even more when the technical issues are resolved.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Liam Croft](https://opencritic.com/critic/1009/liam-croft) - [7 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/amnesia-the-bunker)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker sticks a little too close to what Frictional Games has been doing for over a decade now, but with a more free-form approach to gameplay, the team is back on the right track again. Coupled with an excellent setting, Amnesia: The Bunker represents a vast improvement over its predecessor. You'll still encounter the same stumbling blocks of old, but this horror experience comes recommended.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Lucas White](https://opencritic.com/critic/3680/lucas-white) - [6 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/135773/amnesia-the-bunker-review-score)\n\n&gt;There are lots of ideas in Amnesia: The Bunker that are truly intriguing. I love the World War 1 setting as a backdrop for a horror story, especially the way it intersects with technology of the era. But the way gameplay elements are introduced as friction meant to induce tension simply feel overtuned. I often felt like I was fighting the game just to get around, which was frustrating in a software kind of way rather than an atmospheric enhancement. I wasn\u2019t scared because I was too busy squinting or yanking on the flashlight\u2019s pull cord just so I could pull on doors and latches. No amount of spooky ambiance in the background could bring me back into the experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Spaziogames](https://opencritic.com/outlet/502/spaziogames)** - [Domenico Music\u00f2](https://opencritic.com/critic/3760/domenico-music-) - *Italian* - [7.7 / 10](https://www.spaziogames.it/articoli/amnesia-the-bunker-recensione)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker introduces a brilliant gameplay with many new features for the series. It is a real survival horror with a great atmosphere and a superb concept. Too bad for the randomic encounters with the creature, often not well balanced.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Total Gaming Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/381/total-gaming-network)** - [Shawn Zipay](https://opencritic.com/critic/2451/shawn-zipay) - [3 / 5 ](https://totalgamingnetwork.com/3524504-amnesia-the-bunker-review-pc)\n\n&gt;Frictional should be commended for at least trying something a bit different when compared to their previous offerings. As the studio continued to evolve and iterate on their linear experiences, there is a hope that they will continue to learn and iterate on this idea of a semi-open world horror experience. Perhaps in a few years' time we will see Frictional create a title that again hits the highs of Soma but with the added freedom to explore and experiment in the game world. It would be nice to look back in a few years at The Bunker as being a steppingstone to something greater, but right now it's hard to see it as anything other than a short, \"merely ok\" game from a studio that has crafted much more compelling releases in the past.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Try Hard Guides](https://opencritic.com/outlet/855/try-hard-guides)** - [Erik Hodges](https://opencritic.com/critic/9148/erik-hodges) - [8 / 10](https://tryhardguides.com/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker is a thrilling horror game that makes fantastic use of its setting to keep players tense, scared, and desperate to keep the lights on.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Twinfinite](https://opencritic.com/outlet/21/twinfinite)** - [Gray Giron](https://opencritic.com/critic/9889/gray-giron) - [4 / 5](https://twinfinite.net/reviews/amnesia-the-bunker-review/)\n\n&gt;Amnesia: The Bunker felt like it was somehow different from its predecessors. The puzzle-heavy horror game and a hint of resource management give the anxiety of suddenly plunging into danger. I felt like the franchise made a different approach but in the end of the day it\u2019s worth the adventure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[We Got This Covered](https://opencritic.com/outlet/19/we-got-this-covered)** - [Peter Kohnke ](https://opencritic.com/critic/9734/peter-kohnke-) - [4 / 5 ](https://wegotthiscovered.com/reviews/review-amnesia-the-bunker-brings-a-gun-to-the-worlds-most-claustrophobic-fight/)\n\n&gt;While 'Amnesia: The Bunker' is a brief, albeit very replayable experience, we\u2019d wager that even the most grizzled survival horror veterans will be clenching their sphincters as they navigate Frictional Games' masterclass in terror. The overhauled gameplay loop is a welcome change, though 'The Bunker' does fall victim to the same shortcomings as its predecessors, which makes it feel somewhat dated in places.\n\n-------------",

It has a few issues but overall is a really well made experience. From what I've heard though quite a few people end up not liking it because they come in expecting a shooter but the combat is more akin to horizon zero dawn where every enemy type is basically a puzzle where you have to figure out how to counteract it and use your tools rather than just trying to fight them head on. The exploration and story are also really well done and it acts as a pretty great immersive sim in most aspects",

The thing about Rebirth that made me hate it had little to do with how different it was from TDD but how little I found personally engaged with it. I found the story boring, the characters uninteresting, and I was never scared playing but just found it tedious. \n\nTo be fair, I feel this way about almost all of these games except TDD (and to some extent Alien: Isolation but that\u2019s a whole other topic). For example, I hate the Outlast series. I dislike the walk forward and hide horror games so much that I thought RE7 was like that and didn\u2019t play it for years. Self inflicted wound of course. \n\nI played through Rebirth and thought it had some strengths, but overall just didn\u2019t leave an impact on me one way or another where TDD I still think about frequently.",

At no point are you able to defend yourself with weapons against even the most basic enemy\n\nRE7 was more 'biohorror' with its atmosphere and its core gameplay revolved around resource management and making the most with your weapons when dealing with 'zombie' like enemies.\n\nThere are just too way too many parallels with the original RE than it does with Amnesia. Even the one section of the game that had a roaming enemy called Jack was more in line with RE3 and Nemesis since you can fight back and even have two seperate boss fights\n\nAmnesia and RE7 are both first person - which is true - but both take a different approach to horror, and a lot of horror elements in RE7 arent new ideas in the RE series",

It was supposed to make you feel unsafe, doubting your own sanity in a way. \n\n\nIGN Italy says the game is too guided, which the original also is. It is a very linear experience that becomes pretty easy the more you play. Now, maybe the bunker explains what you need to do at every step of the way. If so, then I suppose this criticism would be a lot more valid since it differs from the original game",

I can definitely understand someone having an issue with it because it can be annoying. \n\nFrom the reviews, it sounds like this game is lighter on puzzles so if the game just feels like you're walking between points, I understand that as a complaint separate from the other games. This one is also supposed to be more open so it would make more sense to criticize it for not living up to that idea.",

The weird alien shit kinda took me out of it and it was riding on the coat-tails of the original Amnesia.\n\nNot played enough of The Bunker to form an opinion but it feels more claustrophobic. Not exactly unique because it\u2019s a Minotaur in a labyrinth it seems (so far), but I\u2019m enjoying it.\n\nHonestly I wish Frictional would just follow up on SOMA with another fresh story with a gut busting impact.",

It was annoying from top to bottom, and the best thing I can say is that it is sorta like Alien:Isolation.\n\nThe irony is that Isolation overstayed it's welcome.  You can complete THIS game in a couple hours.\n\nThis feels like they were testing something, or reusing a test asset from Rebirth.\n\nIt's a bad game, and the developers are aware, which is why there is media bombardment regarding how 'amazing' it is.  Again...Alien: Isolation already exists...and it's 100x better than this game.\n\nThis game is tedious and boring, and it's 'horror' is just a meatball with a giant head with nonsensical AI resulting in frustrating gameplay.\n\nTedious and boring...a game that you can probably complete casually in 3 hours...",

I'd rather have it on steam, so I'll wait when its cheap. I guess I'll never experience a high-quality horror game such as Alien Isolation, which had the perfect length, the perfect pacing, awesome atmosphere, decent gameplay, etc. You can make 20 hour games replayable as well you know. Hell I played Alien Isolation more than some roguelikes/rpgs.",

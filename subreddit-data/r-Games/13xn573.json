The only time I ever played a beta for a game like this I ended up playing it to the point where I had my fill and didn't end up playing the full game on release even though I loved the beta.  I'd just had enough of the game and couldn't bring myself to keep going.\n\nSo now I just wait until full release, and often a year or so after for the later sections of the games to receive patches, fixes, and polishing.",

Finding out you screwed over your character's build 40 hours into a playthrough is a really terrible feeling for a CRPG (this burned me recently in Pathfinder: Wrath because I thought 2-handed warhammers were still warhammers for my two-handed fighter, turns out they aren't). \n\nThat said, it doesn't really outweigh not having that first impression of the first area of the game either. It's an odd feeling having most of the quest objectives and character locations in act 1 of BG3 memorized up until a certain point because of replaying every few patch cycles, and those being experienced as somewhat buggy. Might have preferred to first played it on launch.",

It's often the case that when you familiarize yourself with a game's systems that a lot of combat gets trivialized, and then you have to consciously make sub-optimal choices to get some of the engagement back.",

Some of the early beta impression videos from creators are positive on the game, but will have to wait for people to actually play the beta and see how things are looking.\n\nIn particular, will be interested in seeing how Owlcat adapt the Fantasy Flight TTRPG ruleset this game is based off of, I've never actually played the Rogue Trader game this is based off of, so it'll be a new experience for me.\n\nwe'll see how the game is at release in terms of bugs and whatnot, but WotR was in a much better state than Kingmaker at release iirc so that bodes well for this when it releases :o",

Or the Protoss that is literally just Eldar. Or how Zerg is literally just Tyranids.\n\nMind you I have no issue with this, I love StarCraft. But it's real hard to believe this would just be a happy coincidence. They're way too similar to each other.\n\nThe comment the Dev makes about not knowing what 40k is, is rather hard to believe. Not impossible ofc, but if you were a geeky person in the 80s/90s it'd be real hard to miss something like this when browsing in a store. But even then, it's not like he was the only developer. Others would have seen the similarities too.\n\nWarhammer has been around since the early 80ies. So well before they decided to make Warcraft and StarCraft. The Tyranids for instance, was first seen in 1990, 8 years before StarCraft. \n\nThis may be controversial, but I don't buy that for a minute. Blizz is known for straight copying others and giving it their own spin. When making WoW, we know they took so many ideas from EverQuest for instance, and just made it better. Which isn't a bad thing at all. Loads of Devs nick good design from eachother, cause it's good design. Even the recent Dragon Flying is \"heavily\" inspired by Guild Wars 2 Mount system, but they'd never admit that.\n\nAgain not saying it's impossible that it's just a coincidence and they both took inspiration from similar sources. Games Workshop is about as subtle as Blizzard after all, and has taken plenty of inspiration from various old sources. Including making the Necrons into literal (Arnold) Terminators. Luckily GW is improving. \n\nIt's just hard to believe, since Warhammer was there well before Warcraft/StarCraft. But it's also 20 years ago, so it's not like it matters much.",

From an Art perspective they are almost certainly inspired by stuff like:Classic Traveler the biggest SCIFI TTRPG of the 1970's/1980's, VOTOMS, and other stuff that inspired Battle Tech Battle Armor.   [Even the 1987 re-print of starship troopers cover(printed a few months before 40k first edition)](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1614054412i/17214.jpg) looks a lot like the various depictions in traveler of heavy armor/combat armor. \n\nProtoss vs Eldar Depends on the edition of Eldar honestly their art varies quite a bit across 40k editions in some they look to be inspired a bit by Grayman aliens in others they look just like space elves\n\n&gt;Or how Zerg is literally just Tyranids.\n\nTyranids were completely reworked and had almost all their art changed in 2001/third edition.   Third edition Tyranids do look a lot like Zerg (iirc one of the artists for 3rd edition Tryanids codex literally went on to work on Star craft 2)  1st/2nd edition Tyranids look fucking weird and their similarities to zerg are pretty limited.\n\n&gt;The comment the Dev makes about not knowing what 40k is, is rather hard to believe. Not impossible ofc, but if you were a geeky person in the 80s/90s it'd be real hard to miss something like this when browsing in a store. \n\nWargames were/are always considered more hardcore and niche.  I was interested in 40k around late 2e early 3e (mostly played with friends minatures) so right around the time of SC and even then my nerdy TTRPG friends had almost no knowledge of 40k and trying to convince them to play on game nights was like pulling teeth.\n\nI don't really see a reason for blizzard devs to lie about it to be honest, maybe some un-interviewed dev did get inspired by 40k and just never said anything, but in general it's not like there's really any possible problem for blizzard devs to admit it, GW tried to fight people over the term of \"Space Marines\" and knock off models of space marines a few times and it's been proven and upheld in court the term is straight out of 1930's pulp sci-fi and their armor/model designs are close enough to a lot of sci-fi depictions of power armor.",

But iirc there were no proper physical designs until the movie adaptation in 1997. Just book descriptions and maybe some book cover art work. \n\nI don't disagree on the rest though. GW isn't exactly subtle about lots of their early inspiration, which is always funny. Like I mentioned, over the years they've luckily improved and made quite a few significant changes or retcons. Making the Tyranids more interesting. Or more recently the Votann, formerly known as Squats, because they just couldn't continue with the joke they had made out of the Dwarven fantasy. \n\nBlizz would ofc never admit to directly copying designs. But it's quite well known by now that early blizz did this a lot. Again this isn't necessarily a bad thing, cause early blizz just did a lot of things better or made it more engaging and interesting. They changed and learnt a lot too as they grew, and then they somehow messed up royally.\n\nAgain it doesn't really matter, I still enjoy both worlds  immensely. And SC sets itself apart in many ways, but man I wish Blizz had done more with SC.",

Though WotR also gives the player way more tools to deal with powerful enemies via the Mythic Path system. \n\nBoth really good games",

So much of KM and WOTR feels like padding, you would fight a pack of mobs then 20 seconds of walking is another pack. There is no room to explore or breathe between fights, but maybe that is on purpose because Owlcat doesn't really make a town/city feel alive like BG1's BG or BG2's Amn. Even games like Underrail don't have the issue I feel like both Owlcat Pathfinder games have, that game is brutal but allows you to explore and breathe between fights with substantial gaps between fights if you so wish.\n\nIt lead to me burning out of KM and WOTR at the 80 hour mark.",

But the filler fights atleast on core difficulty are a lot more interesting in general since the combat system is super lethal and if you let your guy go under half hp they slowly gain wounds. \n\nThis makes it so the filler fights are actually relevant since they will actually weaken your characters for the big set piece fights. Imo the entire combat system is such a huge step up from pathfinder, I love the games and the actual tabletop but it really does devolve into buff spam. These fights actually make you use tactics since your guys can get blown away in 1 turn but you can also mow down like 10 heretics in 1 turn of bolter fire if you funnel them well.",

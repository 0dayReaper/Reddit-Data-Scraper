The license is still controlled by EA, per Disney contract. So even if they built and released the game pre-buyout, EA would still have final word over it\n\nThat being said, they've given Respawn a lot of free rein so far in their other project and I'm fairly confident they can do the franchise justice. Fingers crossed",

That is a solid combat system and I for one would welcome its entry into the Star Wars universe.\n\nThat said, I don't think they should use that system for a lightsaber-weilding protagonist. The core of that system requires you to land multiple hits on the bad guys before they go down. That would feel really out of place with a lightsaber, which canonically can cut pretty much anyone/anything in half on the first try. I think the Assassin's Creed system would feel a little better there.",

There's so much chaos and one hit death that it literally can't be like that; that's why you'll never see professional matches in a game like it.

Yeah, there's a lot going on in BF2so you're going to get unlucky sometimes. But after playing the game over 100hrs I can confirm that you 100% get much better at positioning yourself when playing the objectives. Feels much less like you're repeatedly throwing yourself in the meat grinder with practice. And almost every match I play there are people who absolutely dominate multiple games in a row. The reason there isn't pro BFII has nothing to do with the skill ceiling imo. I mean, imagine how much coordination is involved in a team with 20 players attacking objectives strategically. I just don't think we're gonna see a competitive scene for a 20v20 player game.",

Two of the best puzzle games I've ever played are counterexamples: Portal is a comedic puzzle game made by a company known for a slow-paced narrative FPS.

They have also been shown to listen and act upon the comments and concerns of their player base. I believe if they are left alone by the production company in the same fashion that Activision left FromSoft alone with Sekiro, for example, then we have the making for an excellent title. I will hold my breath for this one while I await further developments.",

It certainly didn't seem to be a problem in everything else they were churning out. I guess it was when the numbers dried up and more influential people started calling them out.\n\nOr was it somewhere between pushing for that shit (sorry, Mr. Schreier, I mean \"strongly advocating for it in their titles while not asking directly for it\" or whatever) in Anthem then Anthem releasing with laughable, borderline insulting MTX and barebones multiplayer that almost feels tacked-on?\n\nI'll believe all this when the game is actually out without them sneaking in some \"tOtAlLy OpTiOnAl\" bullshit along the way or some alternative money generator abusing the DLC/season pass it will inevitably have.\n\nAll that said, if what they've told me is true, they will have gained my trust.",

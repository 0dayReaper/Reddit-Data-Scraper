Otherwise it's just the exact same game with a roster update.\n\nWill they finally do that this time? I'm pretty sure they did it for FIFA so hopefully.\n\nEDIT: nvm I looked at the YouTube description and it mentions this:\n\n&gt;Get more control and explosive realism with FieldSENSE\u2122 improvements and new SAPIEN Technology in Madden NFL 24 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nSeems like PC is finally getting the current-gen versions! Fantastic.",

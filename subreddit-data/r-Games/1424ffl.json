I'm not expecting FF7 remake level budget and I don't think that would make sense anyway.\nAnd while it could be enough to redraw backgrounds, cinematic, add voice acting and use some kinda chibi models, there's many ways that formula could be bad or good.\n\nGod I want this to be good. As we got Trials of Mana it's the last thing of my childhood I want remade in as good a way as possible. But I also just want to be put out of misery if it's bad and get it shown ASAP in case it's bad. The suspense. THE SUSPENSE!",

IMO 9 just needs standard remake/remaster touchups because there's a very solid and functional game to build up from. In 8 I see an amazing double layered junction system that turned out to be a huge pathology, and this degeneracy is so on the surface it's not some speedrun-tier, walking-into-a-wall-for-10-minutes stuff, and even if someone didn't do it themselves, they most likely know. Make as much magic as possible and gain as much AP as possible while staying low level as much as possible. And I think if this extremely fragile scaling, and a not-really-dychotomy of just hogging junction magic  (because why really cast if you can customize your attack to whatever, and amount of buffs cast is negligible) is addressed, they system can really shine. I do not think that the game should, mb not even \"could\", be sterilized to the point the system can't be cracked wide open, but in FF8 this leveling/scaling hell is so quickly enrouraged just by how the game works and so easily doable by anyone (yet still masochistic), that it warps any chance for gradual progression.\n\nIn this regard FF8 is similar to Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion to me, system that seems nice and I'd like to just dive into, but so so easily pushes me into total degeneracy.",

And I am not really serious with all of this. I am fine with the game :) Here it comes:\n\n* Only 6 main party characters. Who thought of this should have their nails clipped by a rude person.\n* Oh sure, you can drain magic from right out of the environment, but you'll **NEVER** use it.\n* Eyes on Me? More like Eyes on Cringe.\n* \"... whatever\" (insert Quistis giggle).\n* The Ragnarok? More like \"Deus Ex Machina\".\n* Wanna fight monsters to see what they can do? You really shouldn't, because they will grow stronger than you when they level up alongside you. So please don't fight anyone in our teenage vs. the world fighting story.\n* Sure, I'll suck off boss enemies for new summons. Nothing wierd or strange about that.\n* What do you mean, the party falls asleep at regular intervals, so we can do some lore exposition about the past?\n* Triple Triad? More like Triple the playtime you spend in the rest of the game, so you can push cards up Quezacoatl's arse, to make you buff.\n* Yes, our school is called \"Garden\". Did I tell you the whole thing can fly? Just a few inches above the ground, though. And in the water it swims instead of fly over it. Don't bother thinking why.\n* Press R1 at the right time during the attack for **ACTION GAMEPLAY**. Only with one (two) character(s)!\n* Limit breaks happen when your party get hurt. So it's better to enter a combat hurt and dishing out the pain fast.\n* You can use your GFs as summons. What, are you stupid? I already told you not to do the game mechanics, so also don't summon your big ass monsters, as you get paid more not using it. WAT????\n* Speaking of money. You knew along you want to behave your game like a job. Don't complain, do your chores and you'll get more money. What to use it for? IDK ... maybe buy stuff to convert into **MORE SPELLS TO EQUIP AND NEVER CAST!**\n* That Edea chick is a cool villain. Did I tell you she's actually a good guy ... **AND YOUR MOM**? Spoiler: She's not ***really*** your mom.\n* The guy from the past is your dad, though. But it doesn't matter in the grand scheme.\n* What to do, if you created so much art for the locations that you can't fit it onto one CD? Easy: just make most locations inaccessible for the last part of the game. No one wants to finish side quests anyway.\n* Did I mention that you can find hidden places of .. no not treasure. **MORE MAGIC THAT YOU WILL NEVER USE!**\n* Do you know the Card Queen? Did you know she is the most hated character in all of Final Fantasy? Funny. I spent months decoding the PAL PSX RNG in FF8 to make spreading rules consistently.\n* Chibi? We are a teenage drama baby, anorexia all the way.\n* Can we have a character that dresses and acts like a 22-year-old? And one dressing and acting like a 13-year-old? **CAN WE HAVE THEM DATE?** They are both 17! Relax! The fact that you know who I mean is actually a plus for the writers, making them very iconic.\n* Gradually making your party stronger? Nah man, better farm some fish and play some card to get functionally invincible for CD1 after barely 1 hour. Who needs difficulty in a game where the plot has teenagers facing the odds against an entire military and their leader sorceress?\n* You can rent cars! But you really don't ever need or even want to. But you **can!**\n\nThat actually fit into on post. I must be off my game. Tried to be brief, though.",

It uses AI Upscaled backgrounds that were trained on the original high resolution renders that the team was able to find. They did a lot of work cleaning these backgrounds up and making them useable in the game. The mod also does a lot of other great graphical tweaks. It's a great way to play through the game with a new coat of paint.",

I'm just going to pull out my old reliable here, Bluepoints Demons Souls remake completely butchers the games art direction, however henceforth it will be treated as the new default and it will be whats ported to pc, while the real game rots on Ps3. The only sensible way to play the real Demons Souls is to emulate it, Halo anniversary got it right by letting you switch between old and new graphics at a button press.",

I liked probably 90% of the game, with some relatively small complaints around padding but otherwise they did a great job of adapting and expanding the world.

As a fan of the original since '97 I was immensely excited for *Remake*, and now I don't really care at all about *Rebirth* or the rest of what I'm pretty certain is just going to be professional fan fiction.",

The graphics, cinematics, and voice acting were all a huge leap forward at the time.\n\nThat said, I actually think FFX is the oldest \u201cmodern\u201d Final Fantasy title in the sense that doesn\u2019t need a remake. It still looks and plays great today.\n\nPlus the full voice acting means that a remake will be challenging. Assuming they\u2019d redo the voices, it\u2019ll betray the memories of older players with nostalgia. I love pretty much all of the VA in FFX and really don\u2019t want to see the characters reimagined in that way.",

But, given how weird the game is, it's kinda fine? Like you could fix the combat system, and 8 will still be this weird confusing tonal mess. \n\nBut the combat system in 9 is actually the worst part of the game. It's slow, and unresponsive. And Trance is the worst implimentation of Limit Breaks in the game, because they're actively annoying (Uncontrollable usage, long unskippable animations).",

Fix trance too cause it's useless 99% of the time.\n\nSeriously, for how much the fan base of the game praises the game as \"Sakaguchi's magnum opus\" etc. one would expect not as much of a mess the game ended up being. I don't have the nostalgia goggles and I was on a JRPG binge last year, playing FF5 (loved it. Absolute gem of a game), FF12 (much better than expected. Hunts were fun and programming your party was too), FF Tactics, and FF9 all for the first time and FF9 was easily the \"worst\" title for me out of the bunch. It's probably more so a case of reading how amazing the game was to so many people over the years and then it being littered with all that stuff (most notably the sluggish combat, which was bad even with the moguri mod speed up) that just bogs it down.  I also played XB3 last year.\n\nI really hope they fix all that stuff in the remake because despite sounding so negative I enjoyed the game enough to play through it and I'd easily give it a shot again.",

I love FF8, it's one of my favourite titles in the series, but when I played it again recently it amazed me how many things they allude to and then never fleshed out as much as I'd hoped.\n\nAdel still being fully sapient and trying to remind the world she's still alive through the radio waves for example, and that being the reason they're not working. So creepy and dark, but Adel is limited to very few lines and never expanded on as a character other than an example as to why the world hates sorceresses. There's so much potential for her beyond being a second fiddle villain. \n\nI think FF8 is easily way up there on the list of game worlds I want to see redone and expanded upon. I only hope that when (or if) they ever get around to it, they give it the budget it needs.",

The music is great. The end of Disc 1 is so exciting. I love the setting with the SeeD gardens. Squall is a great character (he\u2019s not just angsty/edgy). The Squall/Rinoa relationship is by far the best romance in FF history alongside Tidus/Yuna. The junction system is good fun, especially with how you can break the game in a satisfying way. Acquiring new summons feels really significant and exciting. The time-based attack inputs, like with Squall\u2019s attack and limit breaks, are really fun.\n\nObviously this is all down to a matter of opinion, though. There\u2019s no right or wrong.",

They also have a mixed track record with remakes, FF7 Remake was successful, but most of their remakes are like the bad Portable/Steam ports of games like chrono Trigger, just gross looking and inferior to the original.",

It doesn't need narrative tinkering or anything like that. If they could redraw all those beautiful backgrounds they've lost, redo the old models, orchestrate the score, and crank the framerate up to 60, it'd be a wonderful experience.",

A graphics update and some quality of life changes would be enough for it to still be a good game.  It's a faster turnaround for a released product.\n\n8 on the other hand could benefit from an FF7R style remake which would take way more studio effort.  The graphics need more help, the balance was questionable, and it would be a great game for the action combat system they used for 7R.",

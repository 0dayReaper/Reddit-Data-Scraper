I'm glad the game seems like it's going to be actually good. Any comparisons with Subnautica are huge green flags in my book.",

If it puts the developer on the map, we can expect more games in the same universe. The only thing I don't know about is the Story but it would be great if they spent some time working on it since it's so important to keep players engaged. The survival and progression aspect is just one vertical, and it needs more to maintain player motivation and fun.",

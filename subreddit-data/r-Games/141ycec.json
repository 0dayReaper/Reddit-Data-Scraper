However, there's usually 'loopholes' in the writing that allows the fines to be much less and avoids the fines handed out from being open to the public record, so companies still get off easy.",

Also good luck trying to distribute that money to tens of millions of affected users without most of it being burnt on bureaucracy. So government taking the money to invest back into its economy or social problem is *probably* the best way to handle it.",

As long as they comply with whatever changes, then that should be fine.",

Or is it a 1% (or less) kind of crime, where they must be fined and legally set a precedent but it's not a horrible crime in the world of business? If it's the former, then I 100% agree with you.

If you want, you should look through more MS documentation to customize permissions etc.\n\nWith all of that said, as a parent I find it much easier to have an MS/email account that a kid or guest can log in with. Much easier for parential controls and restrictions while also being able to share my stuff with them.\n\nWe have 2 boys and they both started of with \"kid\" accounts and had to use emails. The oldest kid is now 18 and just graduated highschool, and he still uses that same MS account for xbox as he does anything else windows. The younger one still uses his \"kids\" account and its real easy for my or thier mom to control the account.\n\nI hope this is useful for you!",

It's the kind of thing that is constantly happening in the background and you only hear about it when someone sticks their foot out too far.  Ultimately, this is part of the public judiciary",

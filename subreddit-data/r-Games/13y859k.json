The haptics by default are driven by the audio when you plug the controller into a PC. You'll notice that the audio device changes to the Dualsense and any audio you play will be recreated via the HD Rumble in the controller. Since the PS5 OS is bespoke, it was built into it that it could handle multiple audio outputs (think multiple local controllers all having distinct audio speakers built in).\n\nI haven't worked with the PS5 but I've developed on the PS4 and I imagine they're similar given the support for backwards compatibility.",

Adaptive trigger feedback on DualSense controllers is now available when using Steam Input. To use the full range of DualSense features, including the controller speaker and haptic feedback, a wired USB connection is required.\n&gt; \n&gt; This update also finetunes optimizations for some Intel CPUs and we have updated the game to use Intel Xe Super Sampling version 1.1.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for all your feedback and contributions that helped us improve the game.",

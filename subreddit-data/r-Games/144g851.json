Just little things like having to press a button to hold onto a wall, which is really fucking cumbersome when platforming.  Having 2 inputs to jump from wall to wall is silly and I don't like it.

I got to the part on the snowy mountain near the beginning where you had to jump onto platforms while dodging flying enemies and spikes and it just didn't feel good.  I just don't vibe with the controls of blasphemous at all.  They're way too stiff for my taste personally",

The Mages are basically bosses, but they can just spawn anywhere in a level, but also you can accept a mission which guarantees the type of mage that will spawn. These Mages will then drop materials a la Monster Hunter, with which you can craft better/different equipment. There are a few Bosses besides theses Mages, and they are pretty cool, but not as many as in Salt and Sanctuary. The problem is that most of these Mages are pretty mediocre, and because they can and will randomly spawn all over the levels, they will constantly annoy you, and either force you to spend resources killing them, or you'll just run away from a lot of stuff.\n\nAlso i alluded to it, but Salt and Sacrifice does not have a connected World, but instead has a hub, where you will select from a few levels that you can travel to.\n\nSo personally, the combination of worse/less bosses, mages being annoying and not very fun, the game world being not nearly as interesting because its just levels from a screen you select, most of the unlocks being just very basic, and also, i personally dislike the Monster Hunter way of getting new Gear, disappointed me.\n\nThis might sound really negative, but i think Salt and Sacrifice is the best 2D Souls-Like/Souls inspired game there is, and this sequel is just a perfectly fine game, but nothing special.",

I got partially through hollow knight, I like and admire it but just didn't feel drawn to complete it. Dead cells I conceptually like, but haven't spent much time with it in the end. Volgarr the viking I liked a lot but couldn't get too far in it. \n\nI really liked blasphemous, my first playthrough i was maybe in a bad mood and didn't get more than 10 minutes, but later came back to it and enjoyed it so much once I was in flow that I beat it and played about halfway through it again (super rare for me to take a second time with it). I am a sucker for pixel art and this game has it in spades, but also the gameplay was really tight and it just felt great to play through. \n\nHighly recommend and am looking forward to the sequel.",

I am happy to see them go for the traditional animated route with separate artists. also i think 'anime style' is a little unfair at this point since we didnt see anything beyond small movements, and what we did see was not really anime at all. \n\nit seems like their boss animations have improved as well although i didnt see any ones as large as the first game.",

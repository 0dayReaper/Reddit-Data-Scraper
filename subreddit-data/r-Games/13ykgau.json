Love reading about each updates and seeing all the mods people are coming up with. Thinking it may be time to finally pick it up, i'm on a sci fi binge and ran out of tv shows and video games in the genre to hold me over until starfield",

I'd say the most complex part is outfitting your ships effectively but that can be automated somewhat. Other than that you just tool around the sector, doing jobs, buying low selling high, fighting battles. Do whatever you want.",

It's a really well designed game and the individual systems are often quite elegant, but there's just so much stuff going on and you need to know a healthy bit of it to even leave Corvus, the tutorial system.\n\nBut after those first few hours, you get enough reps on the essential systems that it clicks, I find, and suddenly it's not really that complex at all, while still managing to be both wide and deep in the content it offers you.\n\nAnd it's worth those first few hours of trying to remember all the shit it throws at you, because the game is simply excellent, and pretty soon you'll be wondering how you ever *didn't* know all the basic systems, and planning ever more intricate ship and fleet builds that would have been inscrutable to you even a few hours of play earlier. And if you get bored of exploring, trading, battling, doing odd jobs, and building a fucking galactic empire while still running your fleet directly... Well, it's ridiculously moddable with years of mods already available.\n\nI can't recommend it highly enough. SsethTzeentach's video on Starsector *includes his functioning product key*, and the devs are so confident in the product they've put out that *they link to his video in marketing*.",

It may be years before it's on a storefront, and the game is already huge, excellent, and priced to move.\n\nI know it's a bit of a pain but if the game is appealing to you it's 100% worth it today. It feels very similar to Dwarf Fortress in that regard: crafted by a small, passionate team, never completely done, and absolutely worth diving into despite the hassle-- which in this case is much lower than pre-Steam DF.",

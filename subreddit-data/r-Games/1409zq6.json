On one hand, a 2 million dollar goal seems like a sure thing if you compare to last years numbers. But a lot can change in a year. It's been a really tough year for inflation, massive lay offs in the tech and gaming space. Plus the event was just so much earlier than usual.\n\nIt's hard to ignore how effective a tactic it is though. They made like $120k in such a short period while people just sat there waiting to raise the required amount.\n\nTo me, perfect incentives are ones like what happened with Elden Ring. The runner was willing to do a single fight near the end blindfolded. So you can create a push where \"If X amount is raised during my playthrough I'll do this\" and it's something that generates hype and is less crushing if they don't get to do it. I don't know why they don't just stick to things like that. \n\nAnother good bonus was the Mario Maker VS. It's not a speedrun, it was just a goofy/entertaining thing to watch the speedrunners show off. I'd happily take more of that too.",

The scheduling this year might have been a one-off, but GDQ knows they can squeeze people by holding individual runs hostage and abuse it to the max. Is it for charity? Yes. Is it any less scummy? No, and they do it every bloody event.\n\nAdd in an authoritarian mod team that enforces an environment of 'cute chat' and toxic positivity (not to mention promoting the same obnoxious joke all week, yEs cHeF), a myriad of tech issues, increasingly long set-up times (that could be easily fixed w/ a dual set-up, but no, gotta have time to stall), and GDQ's handwaving of criticism (using 'it's for charity' as an excuse for everything), and it's hard to keep tuning in when I could go watch something like ESA instead.\n\nFor more information, there's a lot of good discussion in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1402052/i_wanna_see_botw_as_much_as_the_next_guy_but_2mil/) You can also see the massive decline in year-over-year viewership (+GDQ's tendency to have a massive last minute donation crunch) [on this site,](https://gdq.alligatr.co.uk/comparison/) though that's also due to factors that are outside of GDQ's control.\n\nI used to really like GDQ, but years of them squeezing their viewers dry and pruning / conditioning their audience into no-negativity shills has made me feel like enough is enough. [McSaveloy summed it up perfectly,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1409zq6/comment/jmv2twq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) so while I'm still more than happy to donate to speedruns for charity, I'd much rather do it at an event that respects my time.",

I think it's fun when they have a running joke that comes up when relevant (e.g. I thought it was funny when they added an incentive to purchase the chef outfit to the Mario Odyssey runner and the runner put on an apron when it happened), it just gets kind of annoying when the meme just gets run into the ground non-stop the whole week.\n\nThat said, overall I think this sort of thing is something that's partially driven by the crowd.  Sure, they did encourage it a bit, but the meme happened in the first place because of the audience and the crowd enjoying it.  People were donating for Yes Chef jokes and spamming them in chat because they found them funny, if no one liked it then it wouldn't have been run into the ground in the first place.",

Or, is it having people jump down people's throats when they are the least bit critical?\n\nGDQ actively maintains an environment of 'be cute, chat'. They want childish levels of enthusiasm and positivity, to the point where any negativity or critical discourse is usually shut down and/or outright removed because it isn't the blind optimism the mod team wants. I call it 'toxic' positivity because it can be **extremely** artificial at times, especially when something goes wrong on-stream (e.g. the many, many tech issues I brought up in OP). It's overly sanitized in this regard, and it's reached the point where the group-think is almost cult-like.\n\nAnother problem with GDQ's mod team is that they disregard [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) and automatically assume bad faith, especially when it comes to questions about pronouns or masks. I understand that these are sensitive topics and that GDQ heavily leans into its LGBTQ+ audience, but (and I say this as someone who is LGBTQ+) you wouldn't believe how many people I've seen get timed out or banned for asking what seem to be genuine questions. There's a difference between 'better safe than sorry' and timing out everyone who uses the word 'mask'. Then you have the typical last-minute timeouts / bans where anyone who thinks the milestone might not get met are purged because their honesty brings down the sickly-sweet atmosphere that GDQ aims to provide.\n\nIn short, GDQ's mods dislike anything that isn't a 7 year old's bottomless, naive passion for the event. They go out of their way to make the safe space of all safe spaces, to the point where some of the things people get timed out for are downright comical.

They also ignore that Esa pulls maybe 1/100 the number of viewers as gdqs. And people complain gdq has changed from being more open in chat to what it is now.

It happened with it/its as well anytime shovelclaws was on stream (not shovelclaws' fault, to be clear), and while people should know better than to ask these questions in GDQ's chat, I once again raise Hanlon's Razor. These are the same people who can't see a pinned message about why a timer is broken, even though it's right in front of them. They're not malicious, they're just dumb.\n\n&gt;Negative comments in chat are an active detriment to their bottom line.\n\nThis is true, but GDQ goes so far in shedding any form of negativity that the end result is a chat that just isn't fun to be a part of unless you have the emotional maturity of a toddler. It always reminds me of that one scene from the Fairly OddParents where **everything** is childproofed, because GDQ would rather have a cult-like environment of pure, boundless positivity than an experience that is actually enjoyable to take part in.",

            "comment": "Some very strong runs this year. Lots of interesting variations.\n\nMy top watch list:\n\nThe big ones everyone mentioned:\n\n[**Breath of the Wild \\(Any% Blindfolded\\):**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1835690458?t=41h52m20s)\n\nBlindfolded runs are generally super interesting, runners use clever strategies to make the game surprisingly friendly to blindfold running. BOTW is an example of a game that you would expect to be super unfriendly to blindfolded running and indeed it's on the less \"normalised\" end, the saving grace being the save system. The run is incredibly paced with lots of variety in long distance navigation, blind use of speedrun tricks, and an incredibly difficult and thrilling final combat gauntlet.\n\nI found it super interesting to compare to last year's Sekiro blindfold run, which was arguably a harder run due to the length and complexity but more mechanically blindfold friendly at a base level, vs this one which had less predictable elements but was shorter and more minimal. \n\n[**Kaizo Monkey Ball \\(Story Mode\\):**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1835690458?t=12h54m58s)\n\nMonkey ball runs are always amazing ultra-high skill runs, Kaizo runs are always amazing ultra-high skill runs. Crossing the two concepts is mind bending.\n\n[**Super Mario Maker 2 \\(Relay Race\\):**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1835690458?t=38h38m19s)\n\nHaven't even watched this one yet. Don't need to. It was amazing last time and it will be again. \n\nThese are some of the best players in the world relay racing Mario maker levels for the fist time made *specifically for this event!!!!!*. The levels being made by some of the best platformer creators  in the business (for reference last time one of the levels was made by the creator of Celeste).\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nMy picks:\n\n[**The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess \\(Any%\\):**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1834683732?t=16h16m31s)\n\nThis is one of my favourite type of run. The game is just broken enough to be continuously inventive, just intact enough that you get to see a lot of the game and for no single trick to dominate the run. TLOZ games tend to have crazy odd interactions where you just ask yourself \"How did they even find this?\". There are also just so damn many of them. One thing that stands out is how strangely the game reacts to sequence breaking. You can get certain items early and the game just goes with it but then doesn't quite know how to react.\n\nBecause this game has been run for so many years the depth of knowledge about every aspect is incredible, and the runner and couch put that on full display.\n\n[**Baron Of Shell \\(100%\\):**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ix8rKFQb71c)\n\nGrandpoohbear running a Kaizo. Kaizo runs are always incredible. The only problem with this is that he almost always makes it look too easy. It's hard to explain how hard Kaizo games are, they are made for the absolute upper crust of the tens of thousands of people who are very very good at Mario mechanics.\n\n[**Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum \\(Any% Race\\):**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1835690458?t=8h24m45s)\n\nA classic long slow boring RPG run, but the reason I am giving this a shout is that having it done as a race gave the runners and couch a lot of space to talk and play off each other and generally be excellent and interesting. Furthermore for some reason despite the game being dominated by RNG this race apparently is often very close, and for large stretches of the run it was! I didn't watch all of it since I watched it live but I enjoyed the time I spent tuned in since the runners were so knowledgeable and constantly showing off their crazy command of the game.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThere are countless other great runs but either I had seen them before or missed them. Check out other people's lists for those.\n\nSome others I watched and enjoyed were Returnal, The Minnish Cap, Four Swords Co-op.",

It was an amazing skill showcase, the crowd was also hype for this as well. It was just amazing. \n\nI'd also throw in the Majora's Mask randomizer run, mostly for the high quality commentary and the energy of the runner.\n\nI'd agree the quality of runs this year were very high, even the games I didn't care much about still kept drawing my attention while I had it on in the background.

Having a boss that normally takes bombs to kill as a core mechanic but can still be beaten by some clever use of a hookshot glitch is neat. I consider kingdom hearts runs good ones because the abilities they normally use to beat bosses are often not available so they have to do things very differently than they want to. \n\nThe bad ones are just ones where the players game knowledge is the only thing being challenged. Ones like the 2D Zelda games are usually examples of this. Well, you are just going place to place like normal hoping you find the item it's just that everything is in a different order!",

The runner spent the majority of the time running from room to room, going \"nope, nothing spawned here,\" and running somewhere else. It was interesting for maybe five minutes because they showed how you could traverse areas without technically having the required abilities, but the rest of it was 45+ minutes of watching him skip around the castle looking for the last item so he can go win. I can see how it's fun and tense for someone trying to go as fast as possible, but it wasn't exactly a joy to watch.",

It's good because you build the scene for these niche games but it's also going to be a lot more challenging to make that a fun viewer experience. \n\nSpeedrunning is fun to watch but the atmosphere around GDQ ruins the viewing experience for me. I'm just not going to put up with the level of annoyance for the GDQ staff reading donos for the whole run so I can watch a runner I've never heard of run a game I've never heard of on the off chance the run might be interesting. \n\nI also feel like they used to do a better job of selecting for entertaining runners. Sometimes when you watch a run it's a bunch of in jokes with only the basics about the speedrun techniques explained. If the runner isn't keeping me interested and I've never heard of the game I'm just going to go watch something else.",

In a lot of ways, twitch was a massive money pit which only justified its own existence by promise of future profits. (If you want an explanation of the general trends here, I recommend Cory Doctorow's article on [enshittification.](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys))\n\nRight now, twitch is switching from a user-focused platfrom to an advertiser focused platform: it is paramount for their bottom line that user metrics increase or at least stay constant during this shift in order to justify past investments. I dont think twitch is going die necessarily, partially because so much investment has already been poured into it, but if they cannot become profitable it's going to be a massive blunder for amazon. Twitch isn't over, but it will become more and more user-hostile as time goes on, and if they get out competed it's quite possible that in 10 years the site will be a shell of what it once was.",

The Rules &amp; The whole Politics need changing in the show. Its way to much of no criticism or anything else not seen as a positive thing. People were getting timed out/banned for ludicrous things. It feels like you are in jail or infront of the stand watching someone speed run the game also god fobid the runners say anything remotely funny or joke about something. Sub mode constantly on with insane moderations.. No jokes, no comments in bad light = ban/time out. Here are some example where people got timedout/banned:\n\n\"Chat i don't think we will be able to get this milestone we have 200k left\"\n\nThe guy literally got timed out or banned for it.\n\nHere is another example lmao:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/h7gsS5w",

Making sure things not only run as they are supposed to on the runner's end but also look presentable for the viewers just needs some time. \n\nAlso need some timeslots for the sponsors and ads of course :P\n\n*Edit/Addendum*:\n\nAs for the whole politics/jokes/whatever stuff... you have to remember that GDQ is a charity event first and a gaming event second, so they need to keep a certain kind of professional tone so sponsors and the charity doesn't get turned off by it :v \n\nOf course you could argue that they're going too far but mods are humans too and I'd wager having to police the unfiltered chat of a 20k audience is pure hell.",

Remote runs are especially stressful for setup because you're dealing with a separate RTMP stream into the event, along with runners who aren't physically there.\n\nThere was only one time in the entire marathon where the timeline was intentionally delayed, and it was to meet an incentive for another game. Everything else was just setup time and technical difficulties.",

He could be completely without emotion when responding to virtually anything then when a homeowner came in he was suddenly Ghandi and had all those emotions and could turn a negative interaction into one that was positive. He was manipulative in a weird way that is hard to describe unless you've seen it. I didn't notice until we were at a company function at a local bar. He wanted to play darts and kept insisting I work the local crowd of women. I've been described as cute but I'm a little awkward and picking up a group of women as a wing man? Not in my wheel house. So we are drinking and he keeps pushing it, and eventually he forces this interaction with a group of girls making me his entry point. It didn't go well and he went from \"fun, cool boss dude\" to bitter \"get the fuck out of my way\" asshole almost instantly. I left before I got to see the resolution but he was caressing some chubby girl asking for attention 20 years his junior before I was gone.",

I believe this in particular is worth calling out; it names names etc. It's nuts... ([Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/c4JauUF))\n\n&gt; In a blatant example of Defendants' refusal to deal with a harasser because of his seniority/position, Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harrassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees.  Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the \"Crosby Suite\" after alleged rapist Bill Crosby. Afrasiabi would also call females derogatory names at company events. Afrasiabi's conduct was known to Blizzard Entertainment's executives, who took no effective remedial measures. J.Allen Brack, President of Blizzzard Entertainment, allegedly had multiple conversations with Afrasiabi about his drinking and that he had been \"too friendly\" towards female employees at company events but gave Afrasiabi a slap on the wrist (i.e. verbal counseling) in response to these incidents. Subsequently, Afrasiabi continued to make unwanted advances towards female employees, including grabbing a female employee's hand and inviting her to his hotel room and groping another woman.",

EA gets a lot of shit for meddling with studios but the meddling that results in employees being treated like human beings is good and they should keep that up specifically.",

The low music that had been present in the previous building was replaced by \"natural white noise\" (fans running all the time). Everyone looked fucking miserable. At least before you could personalize your cube or whatever, but now you're just basically in a middle school computer lab.\n\nGive me the cube farm any day, I can hide out and do my work in my own space and go the fuck home.",

Mostly all male,  suits were a requirement (which I only wore one for the interview because I was specifically asked to) and everyone seemed stressed out. After bombing a surprise math test at the end of the interview, I left not believing what I just went through and went next door for lunch. Young 20 something's who very obviously worked at said company were bragging over their sales winnings to elderly people and gloated on how much money they got out of them. \n\nLater that evening, their internal recruiter called me and left multiple messages &amp; emails. Sounded like they wanted me as I never got a formal rejection, but I ignored all of their messages. \n\nI'd later go on GlassDoor to see that they were a frat boy culture. Preferring young graduates and college athletes, and that everyone who did sales there were constantly stressed to push their customers. I feel half of the guys who I saw earlier were probably pushed into these methods and were just bragging to impress their superiors. \n\nWhat a shitty way to live. I honestly feel bad for these young guys being pushed to \"fit in\". I only help they sobered up and moved onto other opportunities. \n\nTL;DR - Interviewed at a frat boy cultured job, didn't accept and think the culture sours young people and ruins lives. PS.

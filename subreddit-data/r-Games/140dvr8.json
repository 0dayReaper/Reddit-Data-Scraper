            "comment": "Adam, I'm going to level with you - your game is priced WAY too high. There's no way I would ever pay $20.00 for an RPG Maker game that is only 2-4 hours long and uses the engine's assets. I played the demo, and while it's a cute little game, I wouldn't pay more than $10.00, and even then, I would wait for a sale. Maybe consider lowering your price.",

                    "comment": "Hi there - first off, thank you so much for playing the demo.  I'm glad to hear you enjoyed it.  And thank you for taking the time to comment here as well.\r  \n\r  \nThis is not the first time I've heard this feedback, and I certainly understand the desire for a lower price.  However, the $20 price for ***A Weekend in Puzzleburg*** is set based upon careful consideration of other games in the market.  I've written a post on my company blog [here](https://sunnydemeanorgames.com/news/articles/how-much-will-a-weekend-in-puzzleburg-cost) in the interest of transparency on how I arrived at that price if you're interested in the details, but the short version is that I looked at other games in the cozy genre, both in terms of how long they are for a \"completionist\" playthrough (as listed on howlongtobeat.com) and how much they cost at full price, as well as comparing the strengths and weaknesses of my own game against those games.\r  \n\r  \nWhat I found is that similar games are generally priced in the $8-$25 range (A Short Hike on the low end and Bugsnax and Eastshade on the high end), with $20 being a common price point for titles such as Unpacking, Wayward Strand, TOEM, and others.  Obviously, ***A Weekend in Puzzleburg*** cannot compete with these titles on the bases of graphics, but it does have a replayability factor that is absent from most games in the genre.  So although ***A Weekend in Puzzleburg*** is **2-4 hours for a single playthrough**, it is more like **10 hours for a completionist** who wishes to soak up all Puzzleburg has to offer by taking multiple trips and experiencing new things each time, like changing the main character's backstory, reading a different book, getting your hair dyed a different color, or solving puzzles in a different way.  **And that 10 hours of content is a higher number than similar games that are typically one-and-done experiences.**\r  \n\r  \nI will also note that what you're really buying is an entire vacation to the fictional town of Puzzleburg, and **getting an entire weekend trip for $20 is an absolute bargain** **compared to taking a similar real-world trip** \\- let alone a vacation you can take as many times as you like for years to come and still find something new each trip.\r  \n\r  \nAll that said, if you like ***A Weekend in Puzzleburg*** but still find the price to be too high, then please feel free to put the game on your wishlist and simply wait until it reaches a sale price that agrees with you.  That's what Steam wishlists are for, and the town of Puzzleburg isn't going anywhere!",

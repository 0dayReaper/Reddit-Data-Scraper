Hellblade's new trailer is in the same vein as the last time we have seen, which doesn't really show me much of a game. Fable after 3 years couldn't have 2 minutes of raw footage? \n\nReally cool games like South of Midnight, cool finally Compulsion Games but okay this is like Everwild because I see a really cool trailer but have no clue what this is.",

With the excepetion of Avowed, that looked pretty meh the first party lineup seems interesting.\n\nBut pretending Xbox hasn't fumbling for the last 10 years is BS. Xbox hardware sales are down everywhere, while PS and Nintendo are up and Xbox was already the console selling the least.\n\nLet's see how they will move forward from now on, looks like they finally have a good foundation.",

Hopefully Starfield starts to right the ship but I\u2019ve never been skeptical of Microsoft\u2019s ability to advertise; the execution is what\u2019s lacking.",

Nothing amazing or unexpected but they didnt embarrass themselves so its a W for them.    Sega really carried the show for them.  Sega having a amazing showing the last few weeks.\n\nThier showcase was better then Sonys which was a total misfire but I still wasn't bowled over and it had a lot of filler.\n\nBoth PlayStation and Xbox showcases had a feeling of they probably had something else big to announce for it was pulled for \"reasons\".  You know what I mean?  Just cant shake that feeling of something lacking.",

The Initiative has completely crumbled and currently consists of pretty much solely Darrell Gallagher outsourcing PD to his old pals at Crystal Dynamics. It is more or less a given that the game underwent soft or hard reboot because none of the team that put together initial footage remained, not even co-director.\n\nEverwild is as at a stage where it does not even know what genre it is going to be.",

It all needs to be consistent, and that alone is a lot to manage. People also expect *bigger* games, which compounds all of the previous issues. Game design gets more difficult because gamers want more freedom. If you give somebody a lot of freedom to play however they want, that makes the moment to moment and overall feel hard to design and play test.\n\nI agree that it hasn\u2019t really felt like it is worth it lately, but I think it is unfortunately hard to sell the mass market on more limited scope. The physical size of the map has been a selling point for so long it is ingrained in the expectations.",

That alone trumps Sony's showcase for me as I hate GaaS. What is on the horizon for first party single player PS games? Spider-Man, Wolverine... and??? This showcase clearly laid out what I should be looking for as a single player gamer. \n\nThrow in some third party AAA games and a sprinkling of indie games and I don't think there was any competition between the showcases, this was flat out so much better to me.",

And it's not just one or two things, a large bulk of titles are. No doubt we'll see Fable again next year, maybe Avowed &amp; Hellblade, and then there's still Perfect Dark, Contraband, State of Decay 3, Everwild &amp; The Outer Worlds 2.\n\nSony has done a better job of actually getting their titles out in comparison. Their biggest problem was focusing on their new live service studios when enthusiasts won't really care as much. But also showing what ND or Santa Monica are working on 4 years in advance doesn't help much.\n\nAnd even in a year that's seemingly a drought, there's Helldivers 2, FFXVI &amp; Spider-Man 2 as flagship releases.",

Spiderman 2 is massive and got a nice deep look like Starfield, and we saw Helldivers 2 gameplay. But outside of that we got pure CGI trailers for Fairgame$ and Concord, the latter particularly unclear on what the game is. We got some vague first party trailers in the Xbox show, like Fable and South of Midnight, but at least they were made in-engine with in-game assets. Then in addition we got gameplay of Avowed, Forza, Hellbalde 2, Clockwork Revolution, Towerborne. And then as a cherry on top a good few third party games that are coming to Game Pass.",

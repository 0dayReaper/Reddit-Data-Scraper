The fun part was fighting dino waves but half of the mission is  fighting players which didn't feel good. \n\nMaybe they fixed it. I wish I gave more constructive feedback when i played it. but i wrote it off rather quickly",

Playing the shield guy looked pretty awesome, especially when you would get locked down in an animation holding back a charging Trike.  \nBut other than that, there's so many enemies that don't really do anything but swarm, and not much to the combat other than \"Hold fire and press cooldowns\".\n\nMaybe with more dino variety it can stand better, but it sure needs a lot of it.",

Some horde management games I've played (specifically Vermintide 2) are very braindead and monotonous no matter the enemy in the lower difficulties, but at the higher ones you gotta bring the whole options of combat to manage different enemy types; staying more mobile, kiting, using different attacks to go through armor or specific defenses and so on.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if something similar happens here but I have no idea how the game is structured.",

Varying difficulty between those teams will of course offset things, or split the playerbase entirely if they were different matchmaking options.\n\nMainly with the difficulty though, there's just no depth to the enemies. Hundreds of raptors swarm you in general, without doing anything else. You then get a few specials that either run at you in a special way, or shoot ranged attacks, and that's your lot. It urgently needs some variety.",

We're a small group of volunteer indie devs and gamers who have created a revival of the game \"BattleForge\", which was a fantasy multiplayer real-time strategy and collectible card game developed by EA Phenomic in 2009, but shut down completely in 2013. \n\n**What is our game about?**\n\nSkylords Reborn combines the fast-paced gameplay of an RTS game with the scope of a collectible card game. You can jump in with friends or strangers and start playing the 2-player and 4-player co-op campaign maps, or go for some solo maps by yourself. Most of the campaign has three difficulty modes to either start off easy to familiarize yourself, or go for a real challenge.\n\nAs players progress through play they collect and upgrade cards. These are used as units, buildings and spells on an RTS battlefield and you choose which ones to bring in your deck to match your custom playstyle. Instead of traditional base building with various production lines, you summon entities from your deck straight onto the map using a unique, dynamic power-economy. Want to create a faction with tons of spells? Want to rush end-game units and demolish enemies with gigantic creatures? Or maybe you want to focus on your economy and then overwhelm them with endless hordes? Skylords Reborn brings a unique experience with a ton of strategic customization for both veterans and beginners.\n  \n\n  \n**Ok, that all sounds good... but what makes this game different? How is Skylords Reborn different from the original BattleForge?**\n\nYou can't spend money on the game. Everything is free and earned through play alone. We're fans consumed by a healthy (so we think) amount of nostalgia and hope for a better future for RTS games, so everything in the game is based on your skill and progression.\n\nSkylords Reborn has a dedicated community of players who continue to support and play the game, a mix of veterans and new players. This community helps to keep the game active and vibrant with community-created events and tournaments.\n\nSkylords Reborn is in continuous development, with regular free updates and new content being added to the game to flesh out the foundation and expand upon it. We hope to keep it fresh yet familiar.\n\nFeel free to ask anything here, or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/0y3WGMGXhd5q2lXA)!",

For me random maps killed the game.\n\nIt was such a unique thing that you had to perfectly learn these Pve campaign missions and craft specific decks to beat them for your upgrades + coordinate with your online group.\n\nIt felt very akin to progressing through dungeons with multiple difficulties in an MMO, but the gear that dropped was upgrades for your cards. A very unique way to tackle a coop Pve based RTS. You really had to watch guides etc. To beat the hardest maps.\n\nSadly then came random maps and instead of learning strategies for all the unique maps, you would just spam 4 Player difficulty 8 random maps which were piss easy and brain-dead.\n\nIn our mmo example it's like introducing a new way to progress, which gives you currency to buy any item that drops anywhere, it's the most efficient way and just involves aoe grinding mobs. Invalidated any other progression and made me quit pretty much immediately.\n\nWould've loved for skylords to do vanilla only, but I understand it's not possible to make several versions with the small playerbase it has.",

They even added new fire and nature factions to that mode recently, and damn it adds a good challenge even with a good team, esp. on level 9 and you have to think how to get through the fire bosses at the end of the map. They have a \"map of the month\" too so you can craft a deck just to tackle the random map of the month, leaderboards are there to show off speedrunning times",

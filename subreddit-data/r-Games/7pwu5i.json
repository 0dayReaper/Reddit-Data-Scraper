It certainly drains the fun out of the game quick when you spend 15 minutes looting, maybe get lucky with the loot and find some good shit, only to end up dying in a way that's blatantly cheating when looking at the death cam.\n\nIt feels on par with playing a single player game, and losing progress due to a power outage. That time you spent playing just feels like a complete and utter waste, and is totally not your fault.\n\nI don't care what PU and Bluenote do to fix the issue, whether it's region locking or ping capping or whatever, but something needs to be done if they still want this game to be the juggernaut it is now, by the years end.

The only real similarity is that both have PvP.\n\nHonestly, none of the other BR games announced until now come even close to the polish and fun of PUBG. \n\nThe thing is, as rough and bad as people say PUBG is, shooting in it is still satisfying and that's the most important thing in a game of this genre. Fortnite is way too arcadey in it's shooting mechanics, a game like Escape From Tarkov is way too realistic while PUBG falls in a sweet spot in between. Performace has gotten extremely better since 1.0. What they need to fix now is their tickrate and engine to end with things suchs as start of match lag, death behind cover and shots not registering correctly.",

Remember the studio behind Too Human? The entire studio collapsed because they lost a lawsuit over Epic not delivering Xbox 360 support when they initially said they would (it was delayed because of issues).\n\nThe studio also lost a counter law suit where Epic sued them for removing liscense/attribution statements from UE4 code (almost all software/library licenses including open source require you to physically keep the license with the code. As a result, Epic stripped their UE license indefinitely, killing the studio.\n\nThough killing the studio in that case was not unjust. The removal of license/attribute is a waaaay bigger offense/dick move than failing to deliver a major feature on schedule.\n\n**Also to clarify:** they claimed Fortnite copied their ideas excessively, namely the glowing circle enclosing in, but they just complained about that. Copying ideas wasn't what they considered suing over.\n\nWhat they considered suing over was some dispute about Epic working with them on 100 player netcode and then turning around to use that work to benefit Fortnite. But part of the stipulation of them co-operating on the tech was for Epic Games to incorporate it into UE4. They just didn't expect Epic would shortly thereafter come out with their biggest competitor, which utilized those improvements.\n\nBut if we're real for a moment: Epic Games probably has the most talented software developers of any game studio besides maybe EA (frostbite), Valve, or id Software. Bluehole was by far the beneficiary of their collaboration.",

It may not be a region lock, but they're going to get themselves in trouble if they don't do something pretty heavy to address this. Because of the nature of the game, you spend a lot of time preparing and little time in the action. When your prep time is destroyed by cheating, it leaves you feeling that you've just flat lost all that time and got no enjoyment out of it. With the frequency that this is happening now, players are just going to start quitting. They stand to lose a substantial chunk of their players from this. ",

Frankly, Fornite isn't great, but it does a lot of things better than pubg (and a few worse), and as you said, has made significant headway. \n\nImagine a fully competent developer creating the game from scratch with a talented dev and art team. Imagine optimized performance, stable servers, excellent gameplay and a hand crafted, beautiful map and world. \n\nKudos to Epic for tackling the giant, but Fortnite is without an doubt a mod on top of a very different game. It does show however that in using the exact same engine, competency creates a quality product.",

When another student saw them cheating, they would shout, \"Teacher, _____ is cunning.\" It was a pretty universal translation, cheating = cunning. The mindset was that cheating was clever, as long as you didn't get caught. Of course, we have this general notion in the West, but also a stronger sense that cheating should be prohibited.\n\nI think China has a similar outlook on cheating as my students did in South Korea.",

What you said rings true there as well. Professors at the school can sometimes receive half a dozen identical essays ripped from the first page of Google search results and they are, of course, reported as cheating.\n\nUnfortunately, these Chinese students show no understanding of why they are being confronted about it. There's no sense that they have broken any rules. You can get them to admit what they did, but they laugh as they are admitting to it, even to a disciplinarian. They think it's funny and then they do it again. These students also pay stupidly high tuition costs, so the university doesn't really know how to deal with the issue. They can't convince Chinese students to stop cheating, and they can't expel a nationality.\n\nSomeone also did a study recently that revealed a very large number of them took their English equivalency tests by sending a different English speaking Chinese person in to take them. Once enrolled in the school, the Chinese students can only communicate with each other and most often do not understand the assignments. Their essays or projects or test answers are frequently completely off topic.",

Students would beg me to tell them what the right essay response would be to a reading passage, and while I would guide them to different themes they could take out of the text, with examples, they couldn't produce anything until they knew what the right answer was.\n\nBut yeah, a lot of international students at universities are allowed to get away with blatant academic dishonesty and have it written off as a cultural difference. It is a cultural difference, but it can't be an excuse for not having the skills to produce academic-quality work.",

It used to be extremely common to cheat on driving tests to get a license, and have stand-ins for the gaokao high school final exams.  The government has done a lot to stamp out some of the worst offenses, but it still prevails in Chinese society today.",

Queuing with a random team almost always puts you with Chinese speaking teammates (no possibility of good communication) that more often than not will teamkill you for your loot, or for no reason at all, while yelling expletives in broken English and with racial slurs. Sure, there are examples of friendly, heartwarming experiences, as shown with some kind of auto-translate app in one of Fitz's videos, but the majority of it is negative and ruins the experience the game sets out to present.\n\nFor the past few weeks the bigger sub was awash with all manner of discussion, and the majority wants a ping lock. Comments rarely contained any racist remarks, but most replies were baseless accusations of racism. Even the lead dev PU accused community members of xenophobia for calling for this lock:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis kind of xenophobic attitude that a lot of Western players seem to have online is just disgraceful. It's 2017! We live on one big planet together! What the fuck? I'm quite ashamed of those players that shout these things out. We want to create a great space for everyone to enjoy across the globe and locking one region out ... I don't know what the fuck they\u2019re thinking.\u201d\n\nThe people who are affected the most and see the answer so clearly get even more pissed off because they aren't racists, they just want their game in a playable state.

There was lots of noise so I couldn't tell when player 7 joined the fight, but at some point the enemy team all died, and seconds later each one of my team mates got picked off, and then so did I.\n\nI watch the kill cam, some lone player in a game of squads killed all six of us in the same kill cam. All six, within seconds. There was no hesitation of his gun from locking on and firing. It was so blatantly cheating, I am not sure how someone could find it fun. We were all behind cover and separated from each other, his screen jerked around from me to my friends to the enemy to me to the enemy to my friends... And suddenly we lost. This has happened more than once.",

I stopped playing for a while after I got sniped by someone with a Kar98, no scope and they weren't even looking at me. hell, you couldn't see where I was at that distance.\n\nThen there are the ping issues, which has become more and more of an issue. \n\nThat said, I'm sadly for the ban. They can't curb the issue, but at the same time they don't want to ban the entire country. Yet, we do this for spam, server intrusions and other stuff. At the same time, there are countless games that ban IP ranges that aren't in the country, so why is this any different? Yet, I hate to ban people that don't cheat from China, but are stuck in the crossfire. Sucks either way.\n\nWhatever they do, they better do it fast. Or perhaps the only that play the game on a regular is those who are using said cheats.",

In some cases it is crate farmers that are cheating, in countries where the few bucks that can be made off items translates to actual useful income. And if one is gonna do that, one would naturally want to play in an environment with less other cheaters, which is why the rate of cheating among Asian-region players on NA servers seems so high.\n\nHell, if the PUBG devs did nothing more than shut down the ability to easily sell items, I'd wager that 75% of the cheating would evaporate overnight.

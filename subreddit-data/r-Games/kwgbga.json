While this is technically not the original source of the news and the [original source was already submitted to the subreddit here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/kwfxi9/lucasfilm_games_new_partnerships_mean_the_galaxys/), given how large this news is and how Wired did not mention any of it in their title, we will be making an exception and keeping this submission up. \n\nAdditional information/interview regarding the Ubisoft game here: \n\nhttps://www.starwars.com/news/lucasfilm-games-interview\n\n&gt; Douglas Reilly, VP of Lucasfilm Games, talks to StarWars.com about the just announced story-driven, open-world Star Wars game from Ubisoft, and much more.",

I mean, we just had Valhalla, the studio responsible for it is now doing Patchwork + DLC stuff and probably in the background already working on the next game. 2-3 years seems reasonable and the open world + story telling of Valhalla is good. But I especially like the combat system. I wouldn\u2019t even care if this SW game wouldn\u2019t even feature jedi as playable characters. An AC or the Division style game with solid gun play in a star wars setting? Sign me up",

Just as I maxed out as combat doctor and got bored of chasing the Jedi path I was bumming around near my house  and some guy was setting up a new town nearby. He threw millions at me and I opened up a clinic/shop in his town. For months I didn\u2019t fight a single baddy I just had great fun running the clinic in this town and getting to know the \u2018mayor\u2019 and the people he found to live there.\n\nAs a really authentic character arc it even beat most scripted single player games - the town doc who\u2019d lived a life of mystery and adventure but failed as a  Jedi and retired from adventure. I didn\u2019t really appreciate it at the time but wow does that hold fond memories for me.",

All the marketing hubbub that companies put out now for open-world games or MMOs have never come anywhere near what SWG was at it's height.\n\nJust traveling across planets, coming across player cities. Seeing the huge variety of \"classes\" and specializations you could really make the character you really wanted to be. Combat focused, non-combat focused, whatever way you wanted to \"live\" in that world you could.\n\nDamn I miss it.",

Blood would only make sense in Star Wars if someone died by means other than the two most common means of dying in Star Wars, other than old age or disease or something. Most violent deaths in Star Wars are via saber or blaster.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t mean to say \u201cthere\u2019s no blood in Star Wars.\u201d Just that the lore allows for them to avoid it if they want to. There\u2019s obviously examples of blood in multiple Star Wars movies, and I\u2019m aware that not everyone dies via saber or blaster, explosion etc. I don\u2019t know why the gore is inconsistent, but it is, I\u2019m just presenting a reasoning for why gore is avoidable at times in the Star Wars universe. Iirc Anakin never bleeds on Mustafar, Darth Maul doesn\u2019t bleed when his legs are cut off, and they don\u2019t show any blood when Han dies. I know those are all post-original trilogy, where most of the blood is probably found, and it\u2019s probably like that for a reason, with George wanting the prequels to be more family friendly, and Disney taking that a step further in some cases, bloody stormtrooper helmet not withstanding.",

A lot of what I loved about KotOR wasn't just its story, but the fact that its setting gave them a lot of creative freedom to expand Star Wars in a way it really hadn't been in that medium.  \n\nBut we're going on a a decade since Disney bought Star Wars.  We've had five movies, a handful of games, and ten new shows recently announced, and only one takes place outside of the Skywalker era.  I don't think the books have even stepped much beyond that since the EU was rebranded.  Not that we haven't gotten some good things out of it and that there aren't thing I'm looking forward to, but as a Star Wars fan, it's continually frustrating to know they have so much they could be doing with this setting but seem so resistant to move outside of this 70-ish year window.",

No matter how beefy a dude is, it's hard to believe yourself dumping magazines into a single person. Also a huge chunk of the fun in looter shooters is armor and guns and, once again, there's only so many ways you can spice up real clothes and guns for The Division. Destiny in third person or a mass effect style looter shooter would be amazing so I'm very excited",

They did attempt to fix this in D2 though with way more armored and heavy looking enemies, drones etc. But imagine playing a star wars game and a Stormtrooper taking 100 blaster bullets to bring down when we've seen extensively for years one shot to the toe takes them down or even worse, hacking at one with a lightsaber and it taking 30 strikes with something that can cut through literally almost anything.",

I guarantee that fallen order (which is good btw) would have been even better if lucasfilms was hands off. Having too many cooks on a creative project conforms the vision the most common denominators and sands down the hard edges that make it special. Better to have one person with a clear vision thats given permission to just go for it and make mistakes",

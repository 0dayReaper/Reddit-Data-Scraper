Watching a playthrough of the entirety of Sonic Forces did the job though. And this doesn't look like it's going to swing the needle back the other way.\n\nTrying to chase the dragon of classic Sonic is, I'm forced to conclude, one of the last generation's rose-tinted glasses experiences we should accept are parts of days long gone now. It might be time to live in the world we're in.\n\nOr play through the eighteen billion ROMhacks and fan games the internet is strewn with. Either or.",

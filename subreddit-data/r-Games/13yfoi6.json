If it weren't for other people running around, I would have thought the game is offline. It's like night and day compared to Diablo 3.\n\nI bought it because of the stellar reviews, but I still expected a rough launch.

Cloud makes sense if your use case is latency tolerant (not rendering physics or graphics, but handling network traffic)  and if your game is a live service. Servers have a recurring cost, which means you need recurring income.\n\nCloud platforms (and Kubernetes) make life so much easier though, if you build it right you can easily scale to handle more traffic.",

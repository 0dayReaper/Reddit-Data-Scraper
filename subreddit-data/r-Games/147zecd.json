Not usually my kinda game.\n\nBut, I was seriously blown away by how engrossing these games are. They ooze charm, and they balance goofy over the top courtroom drama with genuinely compelling mysteries and twists. \n\nI historically don't even like point-and-click adventures, or the graphic novel type games. But I had an absolute blast with the first three. Can't wait to see what else is on offer.",

            "comment": "IMO this trilogy gets better with each game. Apollo Justice is pretty flawed, Dual Destinies is flawed but better, and Spirit of Justice is pretty good. The one thing you'll have to get used to is the aesthetic shift, Apollo Justice is peak DS spritework, Dual Destinies went to full 3D graphics (arguably less charming but more expressive/complex animations), and Spirit of Justice has more polished 3D.\n\nI hope they'll re-release Ace Attorney Investigations 1 and 2 eventually. 2 is especially great, and it's never been officially localized in the west!",

I am almost finished with case 2 and it is pretty bad and showing no indication I2 has fixed the issues with I1",

I'll just say that DLC case has a killer whale as a primary suspect.  \nAA6 is great overall, each case was a hit and the new mechanics was really creative and challenging - due to some ritual, you could see the victim's final moments from their perspective and check for inconsistencies that way.   \nLove this series so much.",

I really liked in DD that &gt;!he didnt blindly accept that Athena was innocent and did his own investigation!&lt; \n\nAlso apparently there are some translation issues in that some things that just dont exist in English in how Apollo says things in the japense version that make him seem less like a diet Phoenix",

While the main protagonist is still clueless, as it's a player stand-in that represents the most clueless kind of player, the sidekicks are super helpful, and the villains have interesting plans. The exploration is also improved, too. The difficulty isn't too challenging with how telegraphed the clues are, but that makes gameplay not too frustrating and trial-and-error, in my opinion.",

Cases are also pretty complex and layered.\n\n\n\nBut that being said, if you want a serious legal drama using the Ace Attorney system none of the games will fulfill that need, which is sort of a shame because there's no alternatives to the series that use the same system, and there's a lot of gestures in the series to things like Racism, Misogyny, and capital punishment that would be really interesting to explore in a more grounded game.",

The Steam page mentions Sweden having to deal with trade unions, and personally I've always found the economic/logistics side of HoI4 way more interesting than the micro (especially in the air and on the sea).",

I primarily play China and historically a lot of their equipment was 3rd party since they couldn't really produce anything domestically. Maybe a Czechoslovakia should get buffed as well? Since they were one of the biggest arms suppliers in the pre-war era. I do hope the arms market is available for everyone.\n\nSince BBA had a cool irregular system that I think would have been great for places like China, France, and the USSR which had large amounts of partisan and guerilla activity but I think it was only ever applied to Italy and Ethiopia.",

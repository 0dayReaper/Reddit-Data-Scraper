I have a real soft spot for LGBT-friendly games and frankly wish I had more of them when I was younger.\n\nI haven't played much of Destiny, I got started on Destiny 2 and quite frankly got a bit overwhelmed, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong - isn't Destiny more of a story driven game? It would make sense for a better portrayal to show in a game with an actual story to it, which Overwatch simply isn't; from the beginning all lore has been found outside of the game with very few exceptions (it's one of the reasons it sucks they've stopped doing the animated shorts, it was the bulk of the story!) Out of curiosity, how is the relationship portrayed?\n\nKinda makes me think of how Borderlands really effectively shows off LGB (honestly can't remember if they have transgender characters... I seem to recall ProZD voicing an NB robot?) characters by having you run errands for them while they idly chat to you. Very few of the voicelines reference sexuality at all, to the point where it was initially an *accident* when Axton turned out to be bisexual.",

While the main season is going on, they always add side stories as lore to weapon and gear that players can read or ignore of they choose to.\n\nThe people who look into the lore are pretty great at compiling, creating websites, YouTube video, and even a reddit thread to discuss and compile it all together.\n\nThere's so much lore about Saint and Osiris relationship on the gear pieces that are, in my honest opinion, fantastic to read. This is a spoiler but after the big bad of the last expansion took over Osiris body and left him in a coma when she left, the gear lore covered a lot of Saint-14 feelings and regret over what happened.\n\nFrom how when he asked Osiris to spend time with him that Osiris brushes off, that Saint knew was weird but didn't question to how deep his guilt went for thinking something could be wrong but not trusting his gut, leaving Osiris to be a passenger in his own body for years.\n\nThe one that hit me the most was when one of the characters visited the comatose Osiris after going through the trial of facing the manifestation of there fears and regret, and Saint explaining why he knows he need to join the fight but can't. Because he knews if he joined, he will have to face the nightmare of Osiris which is going to hit him on his failures in their relationship, and he knew he wasn't prepared to handle it.\n\nIt hits really hard that a man who fought an army of enemies twice could have such a fear of facing the mistake that led to the man he loved being in a coma that when Osiris does awaken and kiss Saint, it's such a payoff.\n\nThese were written lore pieces that built on their relationship in such a great way. Even gear that deals with competitive multiplayer, which has nothing to do with the story still has great lore pieces that expands on the universe in great ways.\n\nI just view it as even though the game is competitive, they can always add small in game lore stories to the game to build up the lore and story to gear that players can unlock.\n\nEven outside of Destiny, Call of Duty warzone multiplayer and zombie gameplay have a lot of story lines and lore that build up character that most people probably don't even remember.\n\nI just feel like it shouldn't be that hard for Blizzard at a bare minimum to throw in a few pieces that build the lore of the game and character in game.",

Having a little nicknack on your skin that has a quote from a character talking about the gender of their significant other doesn't really change the core problem with how little these reveals matter to games like overwatch. \n\nThe relationship he mentions matters in destiny because these are non player characters whose decisions impact the content you experience, it now makes more sense why certain things happened in the game because you know more about who made the decisions that led to the content you're experiencing. Story in Overwatch exists to create marketing opportunities and give designers some ideas to theme kits for new characters and maps.\n\nLooking at how it is presented is a very shallow, superficial way to respond to the problem. It doesn't matter how the story is presented when the story is if no importance. Osiris and Saint are _characters_, but Tracer is a set of abilities attached to a voice and model. Tracer's importance to the experience of overwatch is how her kit performs in play, but the importance of Osiris is he's the guy asking you to help and knowing stuff about him makes you care more about the help he's asked of you. I'm not just doing my seasonal weeklies, I'm helping a pretty interesting guy try to track down another guy who is missing presumed dead. Learning that guy is his lover informs that request, gives you a reason to care about its success and overall makes the world of destiny a more interesting place to spend time learning about.",

Look no further than Bridget in Guilty Gear. Overwatch's (and valorant's, who have pretty much copied OW's design philosophy) LGBT characters are purely incidental and cheap. It stinks of corporate management and a lack of appetite for their characters to have actual personality or stakes, lest they be too controversial or not as broadly appealing.\n\nBridget is a breath of fresh air. Not only is she transfemme, which is extremely rare for video games, even ones like overwatch which seem to have a lot of \"representation\", but her story is extremely personal, and driven by her representation. When you realize or come out as an LGBT person, it's not like one day you decide you're gonna fuck dudes or wear a skirt and that's that, it's a decision that deeply affects your life and the way you interact with the people around you, and view yourself. People stop being friends with you, revealing yourself to your parents ends up being mildly traumatic no matter whether they accept you or not, your rights are threatened by those who are less understanding and your place on the platonic or romantic scale among your peers becomes extremely complicated. Guilty gear managed to tell a story that touches upon most of these things while also being a fighting game (which have typically badly written stories) in a universe whose existence is threatened by reality bending threats constantly. For that, it's a much better LGBT story than anything OW or it's ilk have even attempted, hell it's probably a better written story in general compared to anything OW's ever done.\n\nIf you look on any LGBT related internet communities or meme subreddits, there's a reason why you'll see bridget paraded around and never hear mention of soldier 76 or any rando from overwatch or valorant.",

It'd have been so easy to just make him an extreme parody of toxic masculinity but, no, the writers were more creative than that.\n\n(I almost typed 'swolsome' up there and now I kind of want that to be a word, haha.

Doesn't matter if it was the day before Pride Month (which it wasn't anyway. They announced this stuff on the 30th, allegations dropped on the 31st), it still fits with their pattern.

It just feels so slapped on. Like all these characters are already incredibly one dimensional, so for it to be like: \"*that's right, I'm Soldier 76, I'm a grizzled veteran mercenary with a machine gun.... also I'm gay\"* ... like there is no story being told there, or queer identities being explored, it just feels like peak neoliberalism.\n\nMaybe it'd be more worthwhile showcasing some of Blizzard's LGBT team members - the opportunities they've been able to pursue ... or release a cool skin with proceeds going to relevant charities?",

Do you make a character/story where the marginalized part of their character (in this case sexuality) is the focus? Or do you make is an inconsequential part of their character. \n\nMaking their sexuality the centerpoint it is obviously more dramatic and also can touch on themes that resonate with the marginalized group and get a lot of \"I feel seen\" comments. But it can also trigger a feeling of making the character \"all about\" that aspect. Where people across the political/social spectrum will feel like the character has nothing to them besides their sexuality. They have no hopes and dreams beyond those of the marginalized community, no aspirations, they're entirely \"I'm gay\". They also tend to be traumatic stories since one of the few ways we seem to naturally engage with marginalized groups is through the act of their marginalization.\n\nOn the other side, making their sexuality inconsequential is, frankly, more realistic. For the overwhelming majority of people, they're not defined by who they do or do not want to fuck. It's a thing that comes up in small moments like (oftentimes) gendering your partner. It feels slapped on because oftentimes it's a core part of a person that still just doesn't impact their everyday life.\n\nThis has just been a bunch of rambling, but I think it's important that we have some kind of balance because people are often diverse without \"seeming\" diverse. And obviously there's much better ways to help the LGBT community, but this is a company so they're not going to give their skin profits to a charity or do anything that they can't sell, so... :P",

I mean some representation is nice I guess, but they are still being held back by pandering to these countries.

Before this all the game ever had was a \"Pride\" icon that wasn't even named \"Pride\" but \"Rainbow\" instead, meanwhile other competing games have had all kinds of Pride themed cosmetics for a couple of years now. \n\nOW had their first openly gay character 5-6 years ago and they still don't let their devs explicitly mention it *in-game*, only outside of the game. Till this year there was not a single Voice Line in the game explicitly suggesting that a character is gay in any way. \n\nClearly the upper management has not wanted or allowed for an event like this to be a thing in the past. Even CoD added Pride themed cosmetics before Overwatch, so there might be someone higher up at Blizzard specifically who has been blocking this type of stuff. \n\nI follow a lot of the OW Devs on Twitter and it seems like this event (However low-key it feels) was only even possible because a lot of the newer Devs who have joined the team in the last 1-2 years pushed for it internally. Acti-Blizz might've only allowed their Devs to make this event a thing because of how terrible their turnover rate already has been on the OW team (Blizzard as a whole) due to non-competitive salaries, WFO policies, company culture, cancelling OW PvE, etc. They might've had to cave to dev team pressure here because they couldn't risk even more people leaving a team with an already high turnover rate.",

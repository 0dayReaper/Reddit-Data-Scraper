The map making also adds another layer to the game, making exploration a puzzle itself that you uncover yourself as you master the dungeon.\n\nBut i certainly will tell you not to spend 80 bucks on them. The price is a complete rip off.",

If they'd included the extra content from the 3DS remake/re-release, I'd probably have paid $60 for the set.  At $80, I'll wait for a 50% off sale.\n\nI just hope that if this doesn't sell as well as they'd like, that they take away the right message from that. More often than not, these kinds of companies assume that \"lack of sales\" means \"lack of interest\". I'm definitely *very interested* in these games, but the price has pushed me away.",

At least when when it comes to understanding character classes, going 100% blind is a sure way to hit frustrating realisations by the midgame. That's because even if you get an UI preview of what's later down a character's ability tree (which is not a guarantee), the exact effect of abilities is described in-game in rather vague terms (e.g. \"Repeated katana slashes from the overhead stance\" or \"Pulsing beat that increases the party's strength\") - rather infuriating for a game that asks precision from its players - and the progression of these skills upon levelling up doesn't follow a linear (or predictable) pattern. Which would be fine if you could cheaply experiment to retroengineer how things exactly work; except respec-ing characters whenever you realise an ability doesn't exactly work as you thought it would (so, most the time) is a one-way ticket to grindland.  \n  \n(And to your edit - yup, this seems to be a niche coming (rightfully or wrongfully) to the conclusion that it's a ultraniche, pricing accordingly to the expected low volume of sales and low competition, and uninterested in onbarding (and disappointing) people who aren't 100% confident this is their jam.)",

Each 3DS remake has a brand new story-focused mode and additional content in the form of a new class.  \n\nI love the series, but there's no way I'm picking up 1 and 2 again. I *might* pick up 3 if it ever goes on sale simply because I never actually owned (I borrowed a friend's copy back in the day).",

            "comment": "I strongly suggest playing the Etrian Odyssey games on DS/3DS if possible. The big appeal of these games (compared to other dungeon crawlers) is that you can draw your own maps. They're right at home on DS/3DS with two screens and a stylus, but will be significantly clunkier on a single screen with a keyboard + mouse or controller. To the point that automapping will likely become the ideal way to play, which strips out a huge portion of the games' identity. That and these ports are ludicrously overpriced, $40 per game or $80 for the bundle, for bare minimum remasters of old games.\n\nIt's sad because I do want to see the franchise succeed, but I just can't imagine it having a future on modern platforms. These games were made for the DS/3DS dual screens.",

On the surface level, yeah, it's an extra layer of work - you have to map what's there, so you know for your next run. Walls, one-way paths, FOE paths, farm spots, dungeon mechanics like pitfalls or whatever. That's what you start with, and it does seem like a pain.\n\nBut as you get used to drawing the lines for the paths, then realizing there's a secret route, so you mark it, and over time, each floor's map changes from the \"default\" semi-automap you've made, to this detailed bit of your personal RPG narrative (almost). I liked to mark where I've had trouble, or where the FOEs gang up on me, or areas I still need to check out, or great farming locations. When I move on from a floor, it feels like I explored this area and learned it in full, and it's satisfying. \n\nPlus, using the stylus has this nice \"writing\" sound when drawing walls, and that experience is still, STILL, so unique. I'm trying to find my Super Mario Maker 2 stylus, to use with the Switch version of the HD remasters. \n\nIt's just so specific, and it doesn't make the game easier for pick-up-and-go gameplay. But the end result is an RPG satisfaction that is actually unique for EO.",

Nothing like returning to the early levels and realising you were using the sparkly symbol for teleport traps instead of the number symbol system established when they became more complex.",

Why charge $60CAD for each game? \n\nLike these are amazing games but this is a trash collection.",

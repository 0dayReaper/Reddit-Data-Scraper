In addition, Maryland (where Bethesda is located) has data breach notification laws that govern how entities are supposed to handle personal information being leaked.\n\nI hope that if you were affected that you contact the proper people at,\n\nEU (to find countries in Europe not listed, look here https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm)\n\nUK- https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/report-a-breach/ or https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/make-a-complaint\n\nNetherlands- https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/contact-met-de-autoriteit-persoonsgegevens/tip-ons\n\nUS (Do both as there are state and federal laws)- \nhttps://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Company#crnt\n\nhttp://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/Complaints/general.aspx\n\nCanada- https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/report-a-concern/file-a-formal-privacy-complaint/\n\nAustralia- https://www.oaic.gov.au/individuals/how-do-i-make-a-privacy-complaint\n\nCompanies have to learn that consumer data is the most valuable asset they have.

There's no way that they couldn't have delayed Fallout 76 to improve it.  So the only explanation was that some people decided it was better to release a broken game on time than to delay it.",

They accidentally put Anthrax in all the canvas bags they promised customers?\n\nalso this has to be the end of Fallout right? Or at least a VERY long hiatus because Jesus this game and Bethesda's piss poor handling of everything around it has left a mark on the series that will live in infamy. ",

Only alternative is to open more studios or outsource it to another company (which they haven't wanted to do since New Vegas showed them up, it's still the highest rated Fallout).",

However, their games are full of bugs, may of which are unacceptable.\n\nFor example did you know that the final boss of the dragonborn dlc glitches out and becomes unkillable if you damage him to fast? On the PS3 version of skyrim I ended up killing him with flames. Which is a weak starting spell for those unfamiliar. \n\nYes, the only way to kill the FINAL BOSS was to use one of the weakest spells in the games. Just to stop him from glitching. \n\nThat is the kind of quality testing you get from a Bethesda game. ",

Loved 1 as everyone did, thought 2 was an excellent sequel with some more mature story telling, and 3 was probably about as good, maybe a bit more of the same.\n\nI bounced off 4 within a few hours because it felt like the same exact game yet again, and can't tell you a single thing that happened throughout the first half of 5 that I played because it all blended together into third person cover shooter slurry.\n\nIt's a boring series that never figured out how to evolve past the second game, with competent shooting but none of the unique level design that made the first couple of entries stand out.\n\nMicrosoft's AAA first party studios really, desperately need to start doing something more interesting than shooters, racing games and live service crap.\n\nThat said, their lower budget titles like Ori, Pentiment, Hi Fi Rush... all fantastic. Why do they get those right but can't figure out how to make good games that actually test the limits of their hardware? I guess we'll see with Starfield and Fable but to say I'm pessimistic (especially with the leak of Starfield's \"pillow talk\" dialogue) would be to put it mildly.",

The animations took a step back. It looks great but the gameplay suffered from the cuts to those systems IMO. This is the best representation of what I mean. Again this isn't about how it looks but how the game feels while using weapons and other small things that are just gone for no real reason I can logically think of. And I agree this new trilogy is a snooze compared to the old games. Hive Busters would have been a better starting point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalWT8oNxhk",

The series' identity is built around fighting these monsters, but when Gears 3 kind of wrapped everything up nicely, they can't just introduce a completely new, unrelated enemy force that was apparently sitting there waiting the entire time. No one would ever buy it. They had the robots in 4 but they were never going to make those the primary enemy (and it probably would've sucked if they did). You need to have gross monster enemies, including humanoid forms because it's a third person cover shooter with a multiplayer mode, but you also can't really pull something completely new out of your ass. Really doing Locust 2.0 was the only real choice, the worldbuilding doesn't really allow for much else and I don't think people would really be interested in a whole game of humans vs humans. It's a tough dilemma when the story needs one thing but the game itself needs to stay true to its identity.",

They spent decades fighting a superior fighting force, decades again trying to rebuild the world, just to find out their enemy came back stronger and from their own hubris. While there are other monsters out there that we see in Hivebusters, the Swarm/Locust are a dark reflection of the COG and humanity. It's natural evolution vs. technological innovation. \n\nHalo had that starting too. Halo 4 was a dead end. But the Created were a potentially great enemy for a society that grew too much to rely on artificial intelligence. Except everyone hated Halo 5 so we got a safe reboot.",

The idea that the game would revolve around hunting Master Chief/evading Spartan Locke was extremely common. \n\n&gt;  The game's mainstream marketing received some criticism for being different from the game's plot. Phil Hornshaw of Digital Trends wrote that Halo 5's marketing \"suggests an emotional conflict between the questionably-loyal Chief and the 'traitor-hunting' Osiris leader, Locke, but those moments are barely in the game\".\n\nAnd that niche podcast had over 6 million listeners. \n\n\nB. That's an opinion.",

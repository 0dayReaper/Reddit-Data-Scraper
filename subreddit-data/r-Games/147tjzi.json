I think respawn has easily done the best \u201cunderpowered\u201d Jedi gameplay (as in realistic, not super hero mode.)\n\nI think we could have another game that is more like force unleashed made by someone else where it\u2019s more about blasting your powers around all the time. \n\nThe only thing that doesn\u2019t look right to me is she looks really stiff as the looks around with the blaster, like the controls are too stiff. I imagine that may just be because of the demo though.",

They're soulslike metroidvanias with a deep and singilar story focus. This on the other hand, feels good to have these things.",

It's a very good-looking game, but not impossibly so, merely meeting the extremely high standards that have materialized themselves for contemporary AAA titles, for the most part at least (facial animations are a bit below average).",

The KOTOR games managed to do something genuinely unique and interesting with Star Wars. None of these Disney-era games are going to reach that level of greatness when they're stuck retelling the same stories that Star Wars has been telling for fifty years.",

Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is probably a close 2nd for \"best star wars game ever\" behind KOTOR. Jedi Academy is without a doubt the best Real Time Jedi game every. Incredibly fun game to play single player or multiplayer just for the light saber fighting alone. Cannot emphasize how fun and entertaining the combined 5 styles of lightsaber combat (single saber: light, medium, heavy, double saber, and saber staff), in addition to all the force powers. That game was ahead of its time IMO and has been unmatched since.",

It's why in media res storytelling is so effective.\n\nI'm sure Disney will one day fast-forward, but once you do, you answer basically all the remaining questions in the world.  It becomes a known quantity, which reduces players ability to imagine their own stories.\n\nedit: For example, the sequel trilogy has nearly killed general interest in the franchise -- if they jumped 3000 years in the future and it was also a bad story, they'd be stuck with a dead-end franchise or have to retcon.

Like for this game, you could have a whole huge crime syndicate full of characters that have never been mentioned before, with a \"last boss\" that feels like a \"last boss\" all without even touching on any of the OT characters.\n\nThinking otherwise would be like saying any games made about World War 2 don't work because Hitler is the \"last boss\" and nothing you do in the pacific matters because it doesn't change the fact that the bombs are what end the war. If it's a good story, it doesn't matter that you don't directly influence \"the end\".",

They were treated as legitimate institutions with flaws and ideologies, and not just words representing two big armies having it out.  To be clear, I think Andor is the best Star Wars has been since Empire, but it\u2019s only because it was willing to be grounded with the setting and the people who inhabit it, whereas what I think other commenters are getting at is the setting being overused because the people with money have an idea of what a profitable SW game/movie/show looks like, and it\u2019s the Empire vs the Rebels. There is so much room for expansion of the Galaxy, but you can\u2019t trade on recognition if you\u2019re going at it from a truly new angle.",

I know for a fact that Disney is keeping The High Republic age close to the chest. The new movie series will be in The New Republic, so Disney probably doesn't want anything in that either. Being how every new fiction will be considered canon, I can understand why Disney doesn't want anything to interfere with those plans. \n\nAt least they put it in [The Outer Rim](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Outer_Rim_Territories) ~~which is so far away from Hoth, Dagoba, Tattoine and Bespin that there will likely be no crossover at all.~~\n\nEdit: My bad guys, I was wrong.

Of course there is other stuff that was popular like the animated series or KOTOR games but those pale in comparison in popularity to the skywalker saga and in particular the original movies.\n\nI agree with you it makes sense to do it in this time period and then really when looking at the state of star wars games over the past decade and I'm just not surprised that this game is playing it pretty safe in terms of setting. An open world game like this in this universe should have come out like ten years ago but EA dropped the ball - they want this game to appeal to casual people who like star wars but maybe not gaming all that much. I hope in the future we do get some of the more niche settings and game styles we saw in the pre-EA license era but for now I understand and am okay with what they are doing here.",

Hell, in the first three episodes the main antagonist wasn't even *The Empire*, it was some subsidiary mining corporation overlooking some backwater planet that no one gave a shit about. \n\nThere was never a moment where we got some long, dull monologue about *the Force* or about *the light side and the dark side*. We never learnt that the main character was secretly a *Jedi*. They even stayed pretty reluctant to add Clone Troopers. It stood on its own two feet. \n\nAnd if everything *has* to be franchise shit, then I hope they at least have the confidence to do what Andor did and not *rely* on these central tropes that *always* come up in Star Wars.",

They\u2019re calling it the \u201cfirst open world Star Wars game\u201d but just based on this very barebones look we got at the open world (and some heavy assumptions of my own), it doesn\u2019t seem very different than something like Jedi Survivor\u2019s. Multiple worlds that have large and open playable areas but aren\u2019t technically \u201copen world\u201d. Like, how big is the \u201copen world\u201d space on each planet? Is Ubisoft just talking out of their ass with this \u201cthe first open world Star Wars game\u201d thing? Because there are plenty of other Star Wars games that have come out that I would already put in that category, so this claim from them implies that it\u2019s doing something different with the world(s), but I just didn\u2019t see any of that here",

Each main sector of the open-world is probably its own planet, because how else would you do that in a game like this when it has space travel as well. The gameplay and open-world activity feels very much the same: wanted-status, random NPCs driving around, heavily story-driven and scripted missions, deadeye slow-mo aiming, simple weapons and items systems, etc.\n\nNot terribly impressed either by the actual gameplay on display here, but I like Star Wars and action-adventure games enough that I'll most likely give this a try down the line.",

Companies rarely make games like BioWare games from the early 2000's today.

Even when they did, arguably BioWare stories were still pretty generic at their core. So we either get to have vague, super generic story with custom characters or a focused, specialized story with a set character.\n\nThe recent Hogwarts game tried to do the custom character setup and the primary (valid) complaints I heard about that game were mostly story based.

            "comment": "Okay, this is more of a nit-pick on modern video games in general however this game is teeming with this modern clich\u00e9\r...\n\nDoes the protagonist have to quip about every single little thing that's happening? It's like video game companies are afraid of having their main characters be silent for more than 5 seconds, so they make them have to comment on every little moment. This isn't as egregious when they're playing off other characters (AKA conversations between people), but the amount of times this character was quipping to themselves/the player for no reason other than to fill in potential silence is maddening.\n\nHave we gotten to the point that video game developers can't create a fully-realized, interesting character that they now just shove in as many lines of dialogue as possible to force characterization? Has the \"Joss Whedon-ing\" of popular entertainment ruined people's ability to create a nuanced character that *actually* talks like a semi-regular person and not \"Standard Video Game Main Character #9?\"",

In terms of combat orientated roles we have plenty of options like Bounty Hunters, but the universe is so big I'm surprised there's not just more... Everything.

Allowing the player to fly themselves like that means you have to take into account they might fly any direction but straight up, which means you need huge maps, preferably the whole planet generated. Then you have multiple planets. Its not something thats really feasible for a game outside of something like Elite Dangerous or No Mans Sky which its whole focus being flying space ships around procedurally generated worlds. \n\nMaybe if the areas are big enough they could allow it, but they would have horrible immersion breaking invisible walls or 'you left the area' countdowns. Its much easier and better imo to just make it a little cutscene and get it done.",

Please play 3 different versions of the game now, one of which is (probably) never going to be made available again. \n\nYou just fucking know that they're going to rerelease the game in 2 1/2 years at full price as Persona 3: Last Mag or some bullshit with it all added in. It's always 1 step forward and 2 back with Atlus I swear.",

                    "comment": "Seriously. I hope that even people who don't care for The Answer and the FeMC route can acknowledge how annoying this is. The whole reason that Persona 3 (unlike Persona 4) specifically needed a *remake* rather than a *rerelease* is because there was no version of Persona 3 that included all content from every edition of the game. A remake was supposed to solve that, to give us a single game to point to and say \"play this; it's the only version of Persona 3 that you need to worry about\". Now, even though P3R will be the go-to version for most people, there's still going to be a bunch of content locked away on older and mostly-worse releases.\n\nI just don't understand the impetus behind this. Yeah, they're gonna add new content to the game, but that's not what people were *asking* for. Nobody (at least that I've seen) thought P3 needed even more content than it already has. It just needs all of its extensive content to be collected in one place. I would so much rather have The Answer, FeMC, and all the little gameplay features from P3P collected in one game with the best presentation possible than get any new content made exclusively for the remake. A version of the remake that did that would still sell extremely well, and wouldn't leave players to keep debating about the best version of the game until the end of time.\n\nIt's really sad that I'm sitting here *hoping* Atlus does the cynical thing and tacks The Answer and FeMC on as DLC or a rerelease. It'd be scummy, but at least then all the content would be unified and easily accessible.",

            "comment": "The actual game content of FES is... bad to say the least, but the story, in my opinion, does not feel complete without it. The epilogue chapter is, from a story perspective, what I think ties up Persona 3's entire thesis in such a way that it endures as my favorite Persona game despite being my least favorite to actually play. I was really excited about a remake that keeps The Answer's story content and revamps the gameplay but I guess they're just... not going to do that ?",

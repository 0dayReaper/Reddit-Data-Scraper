Multiply that  by 53 players on a team, 32 teams, and that's $29 million dedicated to player fees.\n\nThey also said that a current player this year was given $28k, which would be around $47.5 million if that was consistent.\n\nIn comparison, the $5 million total for an average of $500 per player seems like a joke. I don't think they should expect to each get paid the amount an NFL player gets (and they never said they did), but come on, the amount is pretty damn low here. Not surprised they're thinking of boycotting, now that they can make money with their likeness, this is basically just devaluing that asset too much.\n\nThe court ruling said they had to pay players for likenesses. The old NCAA rule said that they weren't allowed to pay players without breaking their eligibility. They could have made a player-generic NCAA game, but they obviously expected the sales to drop so hard without the real players, that they decided to drop the entire series (which was otherwise pretty profitable for them). So if the player likenesses are that important for the sales of the game, they should pay the players fairly.",

                    "comment": "There is too much to college football for it to be a mode. Beyond the over 100 teams you also have to keep in mind that the rules are different so you need to adjust the AI accordingly. Also recruitment and scouting is way different in college ball than in the NFL since in college you have to deal with graduations and transfers and players declaring for the draft. The way championships work is different with college ball having a much smaller playoff and the way for teams to get to either the playoffs or to a separate bowl game is completely different than how it works in the NFL. College football is darn near a different sport, which is why sometimes surefire superstar prospects in college still end up failing in the pros.",

I always loved NCAAF but couldn't stand the Madden games.\n\nBesides pure gameplay there are a lot of dynasty features that never existed in Madden for obvious reasons. Coaching carousels, recruiting, etc.",

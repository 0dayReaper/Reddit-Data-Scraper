He won't be around anymore. \n\nWhich is fair. If the cycle for their game is about 4-5 years and the next title after ES6 is Fallout 5.  That would be 10 years *atleast* and he's probably retire after FO5. Making his statement technically correct. (Even if he didn't, I highly doubt it will be ES7 after. If Starfield really kick off then it's gonna be Starfield 2. That will cement the fact that ES6 is really his last Elder Scrolls.)",

They need to just get a separate studio for some of these titles, or license them off to trusted companies to do spinoffs, like they did with Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nTo compare, the time between Super Mario Bros.

The time between Arena (1994) and TES6 (2024?) (and ignoring spinoffs like Battlespire and Redguard) is *29 years.*\n\nFallout, Starfield, and TES shouldn't be the same team working in series, they should be multiple working in parallel with some slight overlap - if they did, they could have a game out every 2 or 3 years rather than every 5.",

This is across the whole industry. \n\nJust look at how long it took for Nintendo - who are generally very skilled and efficient - to put out BotW and TotK. 12 years combined! With only a remake made by an external team (Link's Awakening, Grezzo) between BotW and TotK, and a 2D portable game between SS and BotW. In the 12 years before BotW they put out 3 home console Zeldas and 3 portable Zeldas. This is beginning all around 2012. At the same time, other devs' dev cycles become longer and longer and more complicated. The demands of HD/ultra-HD game development are extreme.",

I get there's a market for that, but honestly the older I get the less exciting \"you can explore dozens and dozens of worlds\" sounds. 1000 hour games are always made to SOUND great, but in reality, unless every hour of those 1000 hours are mind-blowingly amazing(newsflash, they won't be), it ends up just being a ton of \"padded time\", which is what's making these games take 12+ years to come out.\n\nMaybe I'm jaded, but there's no reason whatsoever these games need to be as crazy expansive as they are. I mean realistically most of Skyrim is empty space. A couple mobs here or there and hidden little things, but the vast majority is simply empty space and menial side quests. I really don't think Starfield is going to be any different. Hell even when they showed off the different planets you could visit, the entire shot was...empty.\n\nOpen-world games have become SO full of padded nonsense it's extremely hard to get excited about them. The marketing is always going to make them seem insanely cool and \"you can do anything\"(you can't and never will) but I keep thinking back on open-world game after open-world game that promises the world and delivers what's basically half a running simulator with boring \"go kill X, and collect Y\" quests to pad it out, that surrounds a usually really good main story.\n\nThis is what eats up dev time, and honestly I can't get invested when I know I'm going to be like 20% of an average lifetime older by the time the next game MIGHT come out.",

I think that might be part of why they're branching out with stuff like Village - where Resident Evil is basically just signaling \"this is a horror game\".\n\nWhen it comes to Bethesda, their first-person western action-RPGs are a pretty niche genre that's only seen competition from, like, Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk 2077. There's very few overlapping characters in Elder Scrolls games, and the story doesn't need closure because it's more of a fantasy setting that stories are told *in*. \n\nIn total, there's really three modern mainline Elder Scrolls games, four if you really want to include ESO (but MMOs aren't really the same as a single-player RPG). \n\nTo compare, Resident Evil has 7 numbered games, over a dozen spinoffs, and a bunch of remakes of earlier titles to modernize them. \n\nIt's kinda hard to be fatigued by my favorite game series when there's not a glut of them to play. I can barely be fatigued by the genre, because there's not a lot in the genre, either. \n\nMeanwhile there's a lot of horror games, and even a fair number of good RE clones, so I hear.",

I can barely be fatigued by the genre, because there's not a lot in the genre, either. \n\nBut the thing is these games are built to be replayable and extendable via mods to the point that people are still regularly playing morrowind and even redfall to this day. They aren't the type of games you just churn through the main story and move on like in other genres. by their nature there can't be a whole myriad of them at once, it's the same problem as when they try to saturate a genre of multiplayer games, people only have so much time to play and they'll find one they like and stick to it, especially for these \"infinite\" games that have almost endless replayability.\n\nSo the idea of one of these kinds of games every 2 years doesn't make sense when most people won't even have explored all the last game has to offer in that time span **if the games are made to the level of quality that people expect from them.**\n\nIf you just want a bunch of poorly made skin-deep open worlds ubisoft has you covered",

I've hit up just about every quest in the game at least once at some point. \n\nAlso, open world games don't need to be made to be played for a thousand hours. A hundred hours (like Morrowind) is fine too.\n\n&gt;and even redfall to this day.\n\nPeople are still playing Redfall? Weird, lol.\n\n&gt; So the idea of one of these kinds of games every 2 years doesn't make sense when most people won't even have explored all the last game has to offer in that time span if the games are made to the level of quality that people expect from them.\n\nMost people don't play open worlds that way though. Few people are trying to 100% and scraping every inch of the world. Sometimes, you just want to go on some adventures, mess around with in-game mechanics, or just kinda wander around and find stuff.",

But his point was that their games take so long to make that at this rate he will be retired before an Elder Scrolls 7 could come out. Which is true. \n\nTodd is 52. We probably still have 2-3 years for ES6 to be in the oven. Then FO5 will probably be a long development. 6-10 years, probably more towards 10. Then, assuming Starfield did well, Starfield 2 might be on the table. That's another 10 years. THEN they might come back to Elder Scrolls.\n\nTotal all that up and you've got around 20-23 years. Todd would be 72-74 years old and retirement is 100% likely.",

Todd 60, likely retirement age.\n\n\nStarfield 2 would be 2035, likely a launch game for the next *next* Xbox console, if it exists. Todd 64.\n\n\nTES:VII would be 2039, at which point Todd Howard would be 68.\n\n\nWe are definitely looking at some very, very long timescales. That is also a lot of time for Microsoft to integrate them into their business, however, and these IPs (and the tech, the Creation Engine is a huge part of the success of these games) are hugely valuable. I could see Microsoft getting some of their studios to do remakes of older TES and Fallout games, and if those go well I could see those studios transitioning into making spinoffs in those IPs. I think Todd is going to hold onto mainline games until his fingers are physically pried off them by Microsoft accountants, but I could see New Vegas style spin-offs being a potential end-point for a studio that has proven its worth by remaking older games within the modern Creation Engine.",

At the time there wasn't tonnes of love for it aside from its Superior Storytelling. \n\nBut it was a time people thought it was \"more of the same\", fans criticised the Map layout and the eponymous New Vegas itself disappointed (hence mods to \"open in up\").\n\nIt didn't sell as well and wasn't critically reviewed as well and was very buggy.\n\nFallout 3 was the big seller and critical hit.\n\nBut, over time, New Vegas' world and writing has kept it strong and carried it into, at least, a fan favourite.\n\nI'm guessing of they want to make a new Gallout, though, they want the full might of Bethesda behind it.",

Sure a few people didn't like that it reused FO3 assets and a couple people had issues with the map, but the vast majority of people liked it. The only real problem were the bugs and performance issues.\n\nBut the storytelling and quest design carried it through even back then, especially once the mod that fixed performance became popular, and doubly so after the first big patch that rebalanced weapons, items, and improved playability.",

Like, Oblivion has great quests and for all its faults Skyrim has amazing non-guild/main quests imo plus top tier world. The modding scene for FNV didn't really pick up until like 2014 when SKSE and ENB work started to get backported to FNV and all the issues people had with the game could be rectified. Like yes, there were absolutely fans of FNV like yourself, but the game was considered much more of an underdog than \"best 3D fallout\". And I imagine FO4 being kinda meh helped people looked back at 3 and NV differently. Plus those fans laid the framework for the modern modding scene anyways, so its not like anything was lost",

Why have them make a sequel to such a mid game when they have proven they can make a good fallout game using the creation engine\n\nI would assume that part of any deal made between Obsidian and Microsoft would have included at least some retention of creative control.  Most likely scenario is that they're making Outer Worlds 2 because they have somewhere they want to take it based on their experiences and player feedback from the first one.",

I remember he said somewhere he likes the idea of announcing games when there's only a few months left because at that point the game will stay relatively unchanged, and people don't have to wait a shitload of time. If I could remember where he said that, I'd link it, but I just can't right now.\n\nSo just because of that, I have no doubt it'll be released sometime within the year.",

Some of the Gearbox writers were involved in the game.

I would still argue that VLC and MPC-HC are vastly superior to Windows Media Player, but it could have been totally not the culprit I'll admit.",

            "comment": "Good gravy am I the only person on here not totally jaded? Yeah the stream went wrong a lot, and they had technical difficulties, but seriously that was crazy wholesome. It didn't ooze corporate grandstanding, it didn't feel like they were trying to gouge me for money or trick me into subscribing to something. \n\nIt felt like a bunch of really passionate, really excited, really nervous creators up there presenting the fruits of their labour to the world after 5 years of hard work. \n\nEvery goof, every moment of going off script (and moments like giving a shoutout to a cosplayer, one who they creatively respected so much they sent her game art which is an amazing gesture), just sold it to me that these were real people who genuinely want to make something great that fans will love. Everyone's on here making fun of them and I'm just sitting here 100% sold that beyond shadow of a doubt this will be a very rare day one buy for me. \n\n**TL;DR:** Stop being jerks, folks. They're creators unveiling their baby to the world, and it showed in everything they did. They were up there celebrating and having fun and nervously sweating more bullets than there will be in the game itself. That was way more compelling than any glossy, polished corporate presentation.

It felt surprisingly sincere, and I can totally understand Randy's disappointed comment about the hardware. \n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the time spent on the card tricks and board game announcement, but it's not a huge deal. It certainly isn't the cringiest announcement I've ever seen; not by half.",

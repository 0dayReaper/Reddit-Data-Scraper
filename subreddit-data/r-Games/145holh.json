            "comment": "Sigh...I used to be such a big fan of Final Fantasy...and Squaresoft for that matter.  Thank goodness Capcom it still out there kiling it but it is a bummer to see a big budget game for an iconic Japanese franchise making what I feel like are some pretty big misses.  Maybe I am alone in having this take.  Their gameplay used to be so much more cerebreal.  And the characters were so much more well drawn and important-- it was a journey with an engaging and likeable cast (and the bro crew in FFXV were definitely not recapturing that either for me).  It feels like all of that is gone out of a total misconception that to sell to a broad audience you need to pitch to some hypothetical lowest common denominator that does not even exist.  FFVII (the original not the remake) was directed at a very niche US market from a gameplay perspective but the world still fell in love with it and it is still the most important game Square has made to date.",

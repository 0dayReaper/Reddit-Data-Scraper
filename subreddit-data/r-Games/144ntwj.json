The material was far more difficult, requiring more study time. I guess there are parties but here in the UK every party in college just involves getting drunk and going to bars.\n\nTo me, high school is still the best setting and Japanese people understand that. Which is why most of their media is set in high school. Even though they work hard in school, they still see the high school era as the last time they feel free of responsibilities. Once they enter the workforce they become salarymen.",

So why should pursuing a romance option in Persona somehow imply that I\u2019m actually into teenagers irl and not just playing a role in a role-playing game?",

FFVIII (While one of the best selling games of all time apparently) isn't looked as fondly at compared to its previous title that's a face of the franchise. P5 really set a bar for the studio, and Katsura Hashino isn't working on P6. I just have a gut fear P6 could have trouble like so.\n\nP4 and P5 using Jojo as influence was fun though. Don't think 3 did it with Stardust Crusaders though.",

Characters have old wounds reopened, themes get recycled, it all feels a bit derivative. Because it is now a specific genre they do have to abide by certain storytelling conventions to satisfy the gameplay, which is fine, but it was way too predictable. You could see every twist coming from a mile away. \n\nI don't know what the narrative framing of this game is exactly but I suspect it will be fairly similar - the Metaverse is back somehow, there are a new set of Palace rulers who have been corrupted by their desires, there's a Mary Sue OC who the story revolves around (because they want to make it accessible to people who didn't play P5, but still need a central throughline), she probably has amnesia, may or may not be pushed as a romantic interest for Joker, the seemingly nice adult turns out to be the villain, the final boss is a god-like entity manifested from humanity's subconscious desires... I'll be impressed if it's not along those lines.",

I've seen a few instances where devs have said that they changed a character's design (size, colour, defining features) because they found that testers couldn't discern them from the background or see them from a certain distance well enough. That's why we have the yellow bars/white paint in games like Uncharted/Tomb Raider. Sometimes the game's entire art style is better presented in a certain way depending on the genre. As you say in a tactics RPG they may have found that chunkier, more cartoonish models served the gameplay and player experience better than just copy-pasting the P5 models.",

Strikers didn't really introduce anything new about the characters from a development standpoint...

Makes me happy just cause I love spear users.\n\nBanners and standards seem to play a big role in general. The logo is a spear serving as one, and there's lots of prominent shots of them in the trailer. I'm guessing they'll have some gameplay focus (probably a capture the flag style thing where stealing the enemy's banner is the goal).\n\nAttacks show their type, have a description, and have a numerical value displayed for their damage.\n\nThere's a star icon called voltage that looks to be shared by the party and can be consumed for powerful attacks. Phantom Judge is the one Joker uses. A physical attack that damaged all enemies in a 3x3 area and downs them.\n\nWhile Joker's skills are under the Persona menu, the new girl's instead are called Arts. Implying I guess that she lacks a Persona of her own? (Could also be this is from early in the game before she awakens to her Persona.)\n\nWe get a very brief glimpse at Valkyrie being fused. No real surprise there.\n\n1 More is in, and All Out Attacks look to be triggered even without downing all enemies. The example they use has the new character, Joker, and Morgana forming a triangle to attack all enemies in the area. Maybe AAOs are instead based on positioning?\n\nNo sign of Akechi, Kasumi/&gt;!Sumire!&lt;, or the Strikers characters. Could still be in as DLC or something buuuut I'm not gonna get my hopes up.",

Marie wasn't mentioned at all in the original P4A because it and Golden were in development at the same time, but she later appeared as a DLC fighter and part of the plot in its sequel.\n\nI could see some of the more fanatical Akechi fans look at that and conclude that, since he appeared as a Phantom Thief in the base game (and even existing spinoff PQ2, though that has its own reason as to why he's there), there's nothing stopping Atlus from shoving him into the spinoffs except themselves. &gt;!And the fact that he may or may not have died...!&lt;",

Complaints about Kasumi I understand somewhat and I wouldn't be surprised if she showed up similarly to Marie. \nI like Akechi a lot, but you can't (for example) just drop him into Strikers and then have a chill road trip adventure. Without going into spoiler specifics, pretty much entirety of the Phantom Thieves (except for Joker) dislikes him and wouldn't work with him outside of some extraordinary circumstances (like in Royal).",

At first I wasn't sure on the chibi art style, and while I would have preferred something more like its original look I think I can get on board with it after a 2nd watch of the trailer. It's cute enough.\n\nI'm sure plenty of people are getting sick of P5 at this point, but having only just beat P5, P5R, and P5S this year, this was a welcome surprise because I wasn't feeling ready to let go of the Phantom Thieves quite yet lol. And this style of gameplay is one of my faves so after feeling like the Summer Game Fest was just a huge miss for me, seeing this leak was crazy.",

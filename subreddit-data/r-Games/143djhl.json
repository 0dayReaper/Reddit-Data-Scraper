Just walking and exploring the map feels so atmospheric and pleasing.\n\nThis aside, if you told me last year that D4 will have smoother launch than Jedi survivor, last of us pc I would have laughed at you.",

In 2013 (so a year after launch) it had a million players a day and 3 million unique players a month. The game was huge, one of the biggest games of all time as far as hype, sales and people playing goes. It had a lot of issues and criticisms that were later fixed, but despite them it was still one of the biggest PC games ever. \n\nObviously it had a spike as they increased support post launch and improved the game, but the majority of those sales were early on, well before the expansion and overhauls fixed the game.",

It feels like the more action-oriented gameplay that I\u2019ve always wanted, yet stays both true to D2 but evolves the game at the same time, and while I don\u2019t think stuff like Whimsyshire in D3 was truly *that* big of a deal, it\u2019s also nice that Blizzard doesn\u2019t seem to be picking battles with their audience.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m going to personally rate it a 7.5, up to an 8.5-9.5 depending on how their post launch plans go from here.",

Not as many skill-changing items/effects as I\u2019d like. \n\nLong story short, while I\u2019m hoping for a little more depth/changes in specific areas as time goes on, I think the game has a very, very solid foundation.

It's why god rolls are a thing and are sought after among the most dedicated of players and when that is put behind a paywall it's just scummy. Diablo Immortal could have been a fantastic mobile game if they didn't go so hard on that. They could have done cosmetic loot boxes and it would have been better IMO. I only say loot boxes because the mobile market seems to not mind them even though I hate them.",

It is designed to gradually make you require legendary gems of higher than 2 stars, and the only way to really get them is with real money.\n\nGame feels fine initially, but especially after paragon 60 you really start feeling it if you don't get some decent gems.",

You aren't seeing every single PS5 player in the same city as you are. That would probably instantly crash your game, we're talking about (at least) tens of thousands of players at the same time in those early cities right now.\n\nThat might be impactful late into the game's lifecycle when it's going to be hard to fill a few instances, but right now that's definitely not an issue on any platform. You just sometimes get tossed into a more full instance and other times you get into a more empty one.",

Except some issues with horse movement, whereif the mouse is close to your character you go slower, which doesn't feel good. Hopefully will get fixed, otherwise it's a great experience using k&amp;m.",

Of course some of the issues I've only noticed because video was focusing on things that had those flaws, but I'm sure at least few of them would become obvious to me in normal gameplay, and in result impact the immersion.\n\nFor example, lightning system. When showcasing how some shadows get correctly blured with range, we can see that camel is fully immune to shadowcasting, both from nearby torch and hero light, which made it looks like something added on top of the video, not something that's actually in game. Then we have presentation about double shadowcasting, we can see that one of the shadows doesn't align with the lamp, which means the only light source on screen is not shadowcasting.\n\nWhen they are speaking about about excellent looking cutscenes, in a moment when priest is pulling a cord, we can see from up close robe looking really bad, even places that aren't intentionally blurred. In addition we also have some weird artifacts around sleeves, see [here](https://imgur.com/a/VPy4mB6).\n\nAnd when they are speaking about ragdoll, we can see that skeletons don't move an inch from impact of ice attack that killed them. And when showcasing weather effects, we can see big shadow suddenly disappearing when player moves away from object that cast shadow. And then when showcasing environmental animation, we can see clearly see that pulsing mass is unnaturally colliding and going through static objects.\n\nAlso, another singleplayer that requires internet connection, yey.\n\nEDIT: Link to imgur should be now correctly hidden",

If ragdolls not being impacted by the killing attack is a design choice, I'm ok with that, but it feels weird to praise for good ragdoll when arguably most important part of ragdoll is disabled.\n\nI've looked into what are other \"several\" points that could be \"deliberate design choices\", and couldn't find anything. Just to sum things up, we are talking about:\n* some things are not making any shadow\n* shadows angle is not changed when character is moving in relation to the only visible light source\n* close-up in one of the cutscenes reveals lower quality graphics than game accustomed players to\n* graphical bugs in one of the cutscenes\n* shadows appear and disappear depending on camera position\n* pulsing object is colliding with static objects and just go through unaffected",

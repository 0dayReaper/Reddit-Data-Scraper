    "postText": "I feel like these days video game releases aren't just up against a review of their quality but, what the loudest voices in gamings (streamers) say about games.\n\nI just finished Forspoken and it's DLC to completion, and really  while I won't say the game is an 8/10 I'd give it  a 6.5 - 7 / 10  in total. \n\nI was surprised and suspicious when the game released and it got flamed for oblivion, that this MC does not care about anyone, and that she never gets developed. I refused to believe that would be the case, that the writers would make a choice like that. So a month ago, I got my hands on the game. \n\nAdmittedly, the character models for the game can go anywhere from looking great to not looking great but the game is a beauty in many places.\n\nThis game definetly was trying something new with it's combat, a huge focus on dialog between two bonded characters that foil themselves, and it's take on an open world game.\n\nPeople complaining about the MC, when I don't understand why in this game people chose to self-insert them into this character. Yet I don't do the same for Kratos, Sora, Cloud, Geralt. I'm here for their story, not to live through them.  The MC lived a life from birth as a street rat, beat up by street gangs, only home burned down, and forced to give away her only family members. \n\nYet people are confused when she lashes out against people in a unfamiliar world that wants her to be the savior? \n\nWhere's people's critical thinking have gone? How can we expect some one with such a life to be anything but an asshat?\n\nWould the game probably have sold bad without all of this flaming? Probably. \n\nIt just is sad to see a new IP/Franchise that ends on a sequel cliffhanger to never get a sequel as Luminous Productions has been dissolved.   \n\n\nI love Dunkey's videos, but yet even in his Gollum game, he made a jab at this game in comparison, and that just really rubs me the wrong way as  his fanbase is huge and many probably won't play a game depending on what he thinks about it. \n\nInfluencers in the modern era of gaming have the power to kill franchises.  People complain about taking risks on AAA games but look what happened? \n\n\nThings I felt that I did not hear from reviewers/influencers during the games release:\n\n* Exploring the world is the main way to power up your character, anywhere from unlocking new skills, stat upgrades, or finding new gear its all out there. \n\n* Each spell in the game can be honed, honing them will boost their damage, boost your magic stat, and sometimes will evolve the spell so that it will do something else or consume less stamina. \n\n* The traversal you have in the game is a small fraction of the traversal you end up unlocking throughout the game. \n\n* The world has so much lore peppered through out it, and you could see the thematic of books play a big role in it. The writers really worked hard to worldbuild this game, seeing as how they wanted a sequel. \n\n* The story has tons of foreshadowing towards the grand mystery of it all, and actively rewards you with hints of this through exploring.\n\n* Any crafting passive you discover can be used on any of your necklace/cloaks. \n\n* The game was never bullet spongey, sure maybe at the begining when you're weak but every enemy has a vulnerability, and by the end of the game depending on how much time you put in you can mow down armies of enemies. \n\nTL;dr: I don't like modern review culture anymore.",

In an industry full of GaaSlop and actually broken releases, it's nowhere close to the bottom. It's a mixed bag with fun combat but a boring open world. On the scale of open world action games I'd rate it slightly lower than Horizon but much higher than modern Assassins Creed.\n\nGame \"influencers\" are mostly just drama-mongers though and want something to invent a controversy over. I watched a lot more youtube in the 2010s, and it's wild coming across these channels that I used to watch making *the exact same complaints* about mostly *the exact same franchises* a decade later.",

Games are art, not toasters, you can\u2019t review them objectively (besides technical aspects like bugs/performance). The idea is that you seek out writers (or in this case, creators) whose opinion you\u2019ve come to trust as reliable and in line with your own tastes and put value in their recommendations. Their biases are actually critical. \n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to read or consume content from critics or creators whose tastes diverge from yours but you can still trust in order to expand your horizons and try some different things here and there.\n\nIf I like horror films and I know a certain critic has a deep knowledge and appreciation of the genre I\u2019m more likely to take his review of a horror film more seriously than someone who generally isn\u2019t a fan of horror. The bias is helpful. At the same time, the writer with the negative bias towards horror can also be helpful if they liked a horror film because it would make me pause and go wow that must\u2019ve been really good to impress them. So biases both positive and negative can be useful. What\u2019s more important is the authenticity and trust in the voice of the person reviewing the content more than anything else.",

Just the fact they (or rather their editors) put a spotlight on something is itself revealing of a bias - that they chose this specific topic for their audience. While the journalists that *pretend* not to be biased only do that because of their biased audience.

They are considered classics, if Forspoken didn't had that price, and better marketing it could have ended up in the same place.",

            "comment": "I'm personally bothered by the gaming culture of having really strong opinions on games you haven't played. It has been normalized for a while, and it seemed to get more normalized around 2010 or so when the landscape of outrage youtubers became a thing.\n\nThere came this point where you began to see people repeat arguments about a piece of media that were clearly not their own viewpoint, but something verbatim regurgitated from a youtuber. This included both films and games.\n\nYou noticed it more and more with movies where people might repeatedly claim that a movie had a major plot hole. Except... it didn't. Anyone who had actually watched it would know that. They'd just regurgitated CinemaSins or something.\n\nIn the videogame landscape, any videogame with mixed reviews, you know in the 60-75MC range is very vulnerable to having people on the internet attack the game and it's very clear they've never actually played it. And if confronted about not having played it, people will double down. \"I don't have to play it to know it's trash.\" That sort of thing.\n\nPeople will flat-out make up complete nonsense about a game's story or mechanics or something, and other people who haven't played the game will just repeat that as truth.\n\nAlso, an even bigger problem is if a game launches in a rough state, and gets fixed later. Forspoken maybe fits into that box because they did patch the graphics and make a bunch of adjustments. How many of the people who hate Forspoken have A: played it or B: played it post-patches?\n\nPeople aren't willing to let facts get in a way of a good narrative. So for example, if you're going to throw a tantrum about Metal Gear Survive charging 10 dollars for additional character slots, you're certainly not going to mention that MGS4 and MGS V did the same thing. Like, you could argue they don't know this. But here's the thing. The youtubers they're parroting had no excuse not to know that.\n\nHonestly, the internet narrative around MG Survive, a bog standard 7/10 Metal Gear spinoff ala Portable Ops, really drove home to me how broken online discourse is, how driven by parroting other people, how intentionally, obstinately ignorant people are.\n\n\"Have you actually played the game?\" shouldn't need to be a question. But it turns out, people will write several paragraphs about how a game is terrible, but they've never actually played it. They're just trying to fit in. Trying to have the right opinions.\n\nAnd frankly, one wonders if it goes the other way. How many \"cult classic\" games have online fanbases who have never actually played them? But they parrot how great they are because that is seen as the correct opinion to have. I've come to believe that a lot of Silent Hill 2 fans and critics alike, as an example, have never actually played Silent Hill 2. There's that old joke about \"Earthbound fan excited to play it for the first time.\"",

It really doesn't matter how amazing any games gameplay is when literally every time a character opens their mouth I roll my eyes. It's not even serviceable, it actively gets in the way of enjoying the game. As soon as I start skipping cutscenes - Which is something I never do - It's over. That was the case with both these games.\n\nThey're both amazing cases of 'Fun game - Terrible everything else'. I think Forspoken was reviewed by critics fairly, Dying Light 2 on the other hand I'm surprised didn't receive *more* criticism for the terrible writing.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am mostly just mind boggled that the Forspoken devs made such an impressive game and then decided to marginalize that aspect by pasting in awful 2nd grade writing and one of the worst MC's in recent history. It actually makes no sense how every other aspect of the game is quite impressive but the writing comes across as a toddlers thoughts thrown at a wall. At least Dying Light 2 has *some* justification for the absolutely shit writing due to them basically scrapping the entire story Chris Avellone wrote late in development after he was falsely accused of sexual assault, but Forspoken seemingly has no excuse. If the writing was just *serviceable* it would not of received the cultural and critical backlash it has.",

Especially those of us with very limited time and money.\n\nOf course, the current trends aren't very helpful, and I wish there were better reviewers overall that aren't hardcore based.

            "comment": "I couldn't agree more. The current culture of reviews is terrible, everything's wildly exaggerated and people have gotten so cynical that games now suck ass before we've even seen gameplay. \n\nForspoken is the perfect example. I've played the demo, and I do plan to pick it up on a sale because it does look fun, but it was absolutely decimated and lambasted as if it was the worst game ever made, and that was just ridiculous. At its worst the game is \"decent\", but the way people talk about it you'd think Square burned down peoples houses over this game. Like, if you believe something like Forspoken was the worst game of the year, or even a CONTENDER for that award, then you clearly haven't played many games. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve is the amount of weirdos out there constantly claiming that AAA games are dead, the industry is dying, etc, which is one of the most insane claims I've ever seen. 2023 is an anomaly in that it's probably the best year for gaming we've had in a very long time, but even ignoring that every single year you can find a handful or more of solid AAA games that gems, and worth the hype and excited. Yet again YouTube influencers and Reddit is constantly pushing this narrative that gaming is dead and every company out there is just trying to pillage your wallet. \n\nIt's just tiring. I went through a phase like that, around 10 years ago or so. I was one of those people who got angry at everything and ranted and raved, I followed all the YouTubers who made those 40 minute long rant videos screaming at video games being slightly disappointing. I vaguely remember a 20-30 minute video of a dude legitimately screaming and getting REALLY mad that Bayonetta 2 was a Nintendo exclusive. I mellowed out over the years as I grew up, and now I'm at a point where I have so much more fun playing games where I stay optimistic. If a game is disappointing? So what, I can have a nuanced opinion on it and talk about the good and the bad without immediately labelling it dogshit. It's easier then ever these days to get refunds on games so it's not like I have lots to lose by playing them myself. \n\nAnyway, I don't really follow reviews anymore. I watch gameplay videos, sometimes I'll skim a review article and get the gist of what the game is like, and if it sounds interesting at all, I'll probably pick it up. If I don't like it, I'll just refund it. I picked up The Callisto Protocol a few weeks back, that also got lambasted at release but I'm glad I ignored most of it because I really enjoyed my time with it. There's so many other games throughout my life that got dunked on by YouTubers or Reddit, but I still loved. So I'm just gonna keep ignoring them and playing whatever I'd like to play. People also act like getting hyped about a game is a sin too. If you're a normal person and you know how to actually handle yourself and manage expectations, then you're gonna be fine. If you're some freak who dedicates your entire personality to an upcoming game (looking at you, the majority of Cyberpunk fans) then yeah, maybe you're gonna get absurdly mad about a game. \n\nThis ended up being way longer then I intended, but personally I have a so much to say about this topic.",

That faux rebel teenager thing. Why did it bother people so much, this one time? I don't know. The main character and the dialogue is really not any worse than the shit you see on Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty or any other very popular franchises (I won't name them lest fanboys come screeching in the comments).  \n\nI do feel like it the outcry comes from the fact she's a woman and *slightly brown* - it's not the awful dialogue, it's that this time the awful dialogue is coming from a thing they hate. If this was a non-descript teenager white male (who's a \"street rat\" yadda yadda), people would be criticizing the game for entirely different reasons, because the very same kind of awful edgy-ass cringey dialogue is found on a ton of popular games with white male main characters. Namely, I think the main points of contention would be the crazy repetitive gameplay and the boring traversal - it would still be a flop, just less of a flop, less racially-biased. Gamers^tm are ok with fitting a character with magic capes no matter how outlanding the fantasy is, but fitting a slightly brown woman with magic fingernail polish? *Nuh huh get your [whatever] outta my gamez!*.\n\nI did find the game was very beautiful-looking though. Beautiful graphics and animation. Traversal is boring as fuck but it *looks good* at least. The visual effects (from the magic combat) are also beautiful. It's not enough to carry a game like this, but it's there and warrants a go at the free demo at the least, who knows. I think because of the graphics and animation alone, sounds, I wouldn't give it less than 6/10. There's value. Not much more than that sadly. It doesn't stand out much.",

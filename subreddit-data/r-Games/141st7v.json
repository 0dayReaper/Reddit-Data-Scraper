It exists solely to infuriate.\n\nStill, I can appreciate that a game like that can even exist and thrive in the first place. A game like Fear &amp; Hunger that actively fights against the player and doesn't want to be played, in a time where games these days seem to be actively clamoring for attention and accessibility.\n\nI'd probably compare it to experimental grindcore: Music that's not fit for public consumption, but still somehow manages to find its weird niche audience, just because music writing is truly that big and diverse of an ecosystem.",

Yes you can die almost immediately in many situations but there are lots of ways to avoid that entirely. Additionally, you *can* save, it just requires either a limited resource or a 50/50 coin flip. So if you know something tough is coming up you can burn the resource and give yourself as many tries as you want.\n\n&gt;A game like Fear &amp; Hunger that actively fights against the player and doesn't want to be played\n\nFor one, it absolutely wants to be \"played\" but it's more about the experience it provides rather than being a very game-y game with clear rules and a feeling of fairness. And god damn, it's quite an experience. It's a better horror game than most games with much larger budgets and dev teams. This small team* really understood atmosphere and mystique.\n\n*Edit: I know the actual dev is pretty much or entirely just one person, but to clarify I don't know if they also did the sound and music, which are absolutely perfect for the the atmosphere.",

Playing it blindly is straight up cancerous experience made only to waste your time. Limited saves and 50/50 insta death chance even on the easy mode? Big no right there, but the dev needed a niche to stand out. Shame, because so much love was put into the game.",

                    "comment": "That's as shallow a comparison as saying Pathologic or Dark Souls is a game meant to infuriate that doesn't want to be played.\n\nI believe that what most people seem to miss about the game is that it isn't an RPG in the traditional gameplay sense. It's an RPG Maker game, for sure, and it looks like one at a glance, but it plays out like a timed puzzle game where you start over if you fail.\n\nThe game is punishing, but not difficult. It doesn't require a complex understanding of anything, nor does it ask for high mechanical skill, but it forces you to go back to square one every time you die. However, you don't really start over from square one because you have information about the dungeon, its enemies, items, NPCs, interactions, locations, and how to use them to your advantage. That's how a roguelike plays.\n\nThe game's vibe and theme serve to engage the player with creepiness and unease while they try to figure out how to delve deeper into the dungeon without dying. It's true that RNG plays a part in this, but overall, you can finish the game without relying on RNG if you understand it well enough by the end. And understanding the game little by little as you push deeper with more information is the whole point.\n\n\nSo I agree that at first the game might seem like it doesn't want to be played, especially when you instantly die a few times in a short amount of time for something that seems unfair. Much like Dark Souls, however, it provides you with knowledge and the tools to overcome the problems it presents. If you choose to push further and look for them, of course.",

                            "comment": "I understand the point you're trying to make by bringing up Dark Souls, which is very purposefully and excellently designed, but it's not at all like Fear and Hunger. Whatsoever. Dark Souls isn't a \"brute force your way through with meta/wiki knowledge\" game like Fear and Hunger is.\n\nDark Souls rewards slow, cautious pacing and observation. As a rule and not an exception, traps/ambushes in the Souls games signal themselves for a player who's willing to look for them. Fear and Hunger, on the other hand, expects me to keep hitting my head against the wall until I find the \"correct\" paths through spite and stubborn alone.\n\nI don't explicitly **mind** trial &amp; error games. Hotline Miami is a good example of one, because it's inherently a puzzle game where you die a ton and eventually work its levels. It does it great, but the difference between the way it does it and Fear and Hunger does is that it doesn't wear on the player. After dying, you get right back into it. It makes restarting easy and encouraging. It makes dying feel normal. I concede that Hotline Miami gives much different feelings, but Fear and Hunger makes me go through the past 20-30 minutes I just did from my last save. Every searched crate, every moment I need to play babysitter spoonfeeding cabbages to all my party members, every NPC dialog that I'm button-mashing through just to *get on with the game.*\n\nIt may sound like I absolutely despise Fear and Hunger but I did recognize a lot of great stuff it does in the moment-to-moment atmosphere. I guess the crux of my gripe is the save system. I just wish it found some compromise with its horror/stakes aspects without making dying feel like a Groundhog Day button.",

Usually these are things like accounting for what locations you will visit during a run and making a build strong enough to handle battles or the associated skill checks. I think of it as a rogue-like DnD session; sometimes the rolls will fuck you over no matter what you do but there are ways to stack in your favor as well.",

World of Horror is the epitome of phrases like \"health is a resource\" and \"only the last hit point matters\". You're basically balancing these three forms of \"health\" from progressive resource drain, and the risk management aspect from having random event outcomes is what makes that hard.\n\nIt would actually be a much easier and less interesting game if all event outcomes were deterministic and you could reliably control how much Stamina/Reason/Doom damage you take at any given point in the game.",

There's a common misconception that games of chance can't also be strategic, when risk management and probability evaluation are difficult strategic skills.\n\nWhat's true is that variance can outweigh skill in games with randomness within a sample of 1 game, but this is why communities for these games don't measure skill based on single outcomes. In single player games people track win streaks or win rates over a large sample size; in competitive games they value performance over a tournament or season and play BoX matches to reduce variance.",

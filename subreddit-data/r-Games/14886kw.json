I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, this is one of their longest development cycles yet and I don't doubt they've tried, but...\n\nNEVER say this, it's inviting everyone to disprove this. The game will have bugs, that's a given since it's an open world RPG and it looks incredibly ambitious and deep. But now that they've said this, they've doomed themselves to hearing this in every single headline or tweet that mentions a bug. It's over already.",

This quote is immediately going to be taken out of context and used to lambast Bethesda when the game comes out. \n\nThis game will have bugs, and people are ridiculous if they seriously are going to flip out if they see a model clipping or a single game crash or two. I think some of the memes about Bethesda games being buggy are sometimes way overblown. Again, just talking about the quote itself in this instance. People are gonna run with it and use it way out of context for clips.",

And I don't mean \"literally unplayable\" the way some people mean it, I'm talking you actually can't play the game after a point because the game's framerate drops to low single digits if you've interacted with enough objects and will crash even more frequently than normal.\n\nKeep in mind this is on top of the normal Skyrim issues on console at the time and the numerous, numerous bugs in the game.",

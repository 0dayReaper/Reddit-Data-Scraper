Mac gaming is pretty bleak overall but the huge boom in indie games in the past decade has, at least, brought a lot of truly *outstanding* games to OSX. Not all indie titles are on Mac of course and the AAA offerings on Mac are pretty anemic, but if someone is a \"I love video games but don't have time for gaming\" kind of person, you can have a pretty fulfilling selection on Mac.\n\nHades (and practically every major roguelite of note), Disco Elysium, Hollow Knight, Cult of the Lamb, Fear &amp; Hunger, Project Zomboid, Terraria, Factorio, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Cuphead, Return of the Obra Dinn, The Witness, etc. it's not going to scratch every itch but it's not completely dire either.",

You're telling me that gamers mostly would be happy to have their purchase of Tomb Raider, Assassins Creed Black Flag and Bioshock Infinite just made unusable because 'lol soz'? Do you think devs would go back and port these games to new Mac API's? Do you think devs make zero money out of those games in the sales? Guess you have to scrap your Steam purchase and rebuy them on the App store for a higher price than usual [because Apple tax] and hope that Apple doesn't break it in the future.\n\nIt's one of many reasons why Macs are just a joke for gaming.",

The further you are from the equator and the darker your skin, the more you need. Average Arab skin tone needs about 5x as long and the darkest skin tones require you to be shirtless in the sun all day, and will probably be unable to ever get enough if you\u2019re as far north as Seattle.\n\nEven though different skin colors are one of the most recent major adaptations we\u2019ve made, our skin hasn\u2019t had the time or the evolutionary pressure to adapt to us mostly covering it in clothing or being so frequently indoors. So basically everyone will be vitamin D deficient wearing clothes or spending half the day inside in the regions their skin color is \u201cnative to\u201d for lack of a better description. The only people who can really get enough from sunlight alone while still wearing clothes all day or being inside a lot are people adapted for northernish Europe but currently living closer to the equator, like white people living in the southern US. And the benefit they get that way is balanced by the greater risk of skin cancer so they\u2019re just trading a bottle of supplements for a bottle of sunscreen. (Or should be, sunscreen is really underused. The sun will fuck you up.)",

Apple makes more profit from gaming than Microsoft, Sony, Activision and Nintendo combined actually. \n\nThey don't need to make games themselves for the profits, have a successful ecosystem and people will make games for it. Phones don't have controllers either and before the smartphones, phone gaming being big and more than a few like Snake or Tetris was not considered possible. If visionOS is successful, they'll make games controlled just by your hands and eyes like they do touch interfaces now.",

I think they knew the Quest had a lot of head-start there with their gaming exclusives, like Beat Saber (acquired by Meta iirc) and RE4 VR.\n\nThey really just need to compete with TVs and monitors. They'd probably won't allow you to connect to PCs, but I'd imagine PlayStation and Xbox are happy enough to build a partnership later on where you can connect directly to their consoles.\n\nThe fact that they intentionally aren't competing in actual VR gaming space is probably why they're still talking to PlayStation at all, by leaving a market to PSVR.",

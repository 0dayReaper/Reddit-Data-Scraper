            "comment": "For anyone that doesn't have time to watch the [45 minute interview](https://youtu.be/oL9R94Lafq0) or read all of these previews, here are some highlights:\n\n* **3 playable main cultures**, there are the Egyptians, Canaanites, and Hittites. There may be other playable factions, city states, or small groups, but those are the three main civs.\n* **Civilization system** where you are always trying to stop the collapse of the civilization in the entire area. So, if another faction starts to collapse it is in your best interest to conquer them and restore their cities in order to restore civilization stability\n* **Dynamic weather** is returning, like fog, thunderstorms, and sandstorms. All of which seem to have real effects on the battlefield and units.\n   * Weather seems to play a bigger role in total. For example, some desert areas are very hot and that means heavier armor units will suffer negative stat effects\n* **Unit stances**, a way to have units do things like \"move backwards\" while still facing forward in a fight. Or to generally just keep advancing in the direction you set. Sounds actually very useful as a long-time Total War players (if it works).\n* **Siege changes** and improvements, which is mainly just a lot of fire specific changes and improvements. For example, setting a forest on fire or city on fire would make the fire spread and have a negative effect on any troops it nears. Burning down a city also might make that population hate you. \n   * No more pocket ladders - siege ladders/towers added\n   * Wall sapping returns (sounds similar to what was in old Rome titles)\n* **Chariots are OP**, since this is a major part of Egyptian tactics they are making sure that there are a lot of ways to effectively cover the battlefield with chariots. Think dozens instead of single chariots like in previous Total War titles.\n* **Deities &amp; Religion**, not too dissimilar from some previous Total War religion systems but all based around Egyptian and other deities from the era. They have different bonuses or negatives, but they barely showed them so it is hard to say how deep this is.",

There's plenty of historical accounts of Chariots being used to charge infantry, including by Darius III at Gaugamela, which also disproves your other point about cavalry. \n\nAnd before you say, yes well Alexander smashed them with his cavalry, thus proving it's supremacy, that didn't stop people. Mithridates IV was still using Chariots to charge infantry 250 years later (Plutarch talks about it in Lucullus) \n\n[Educate yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1q36sy/how_did_chariot_battle_tactics_differ_between_the/)\n\n\nXenophon (the Historical one, not the /r/askhistorians contributor) also tells us Scythed chariots were used to charge infantry at Cunaxa.",

In most of the battles we see with them they lose badly, even in your examples.\n\nIt\u2019s amusing to watch you say educate yourself when your source mostly says chariots weren\u2019t used that much and were ineffective in even the slightly bit of rough terrain (which is omnipresent in total war games).",

There is one famous battle where chariots played an important role and it took massive preparations for it to ever work, to the point that the army litteraly spend the previous days leveling the ground and removing rocks from the field. And even then, the charge was mostly a failure. In the best situation it could hope for, with the most preparations, it failed.\n\nHow do you not see how bad it sounds ?\n\nAlso yeah, Xenophon tells a lot of stuff, and he's widely reputed to be the least accurate of the ancient greek historians. A fun read tho, especially when he talks about himself in third person.\n\nHow do you not see",

History is supposed to be fun to talk about, that's why I did a PhD in it, so I can only suggest that you learn how to act in a social context.\n\nSecondly, once again, the source agrees with me. Chariots were fazed out as soon as horses became rideable, except for a few marginal exceptions that mostly all ended in failure or half-successes. It's a type of warfare that wasn't effective, was replaced as soon as possible, and charging into infantry with one was excessively rare, if only cause getting a horse to draw a cart then to run into a dense wall of people is not gonna be an easy sell for it",

If you like the period you could definitely give it a try. It's a historical game, despite the mythological air that it gives off. They have mythological units like \"centaurs\" in game, but these are just elite light cavalry only recruitable in certain regions. And other mythological creatures/units are represented by \"historical\" units that kinda make sense. It's quite different than other total war because of the new recourses, but it's not that bad.",

I don't like the BS \"fantasy\" games from TW (and Troy feels prone to fantasy elements, things like centaurs are a big turn off for me), but if they're presented as light cav it makes it a lot better for me, and I'm a huge late bronze age fan.\n\nI think folks tend to underestimate how complex and technologically sophisticated the LBA was ... I'll try Troy out and see whether it hits the spot for me, if so it'd be a nice way to bridge the gap 'till this game comes out.\n\nI'm hoping that it's successful enough that they can use it as a baseline for future historic expansions that push the timeline out.

How do you tell the story of the LBAC without Babylon, Assyria, Mittani, or Urartu?",

As it seems both Egypt and Hitties are going to be the main rival in the game (one of the goal in the game is to become either Pharaoh or Hittite's High King), I think the Hittites will have their own unique enemy in early game, just like Egypt has Libyan and Nubian.\n\nSo maybe, Greece and Mesopotamian aren't mentioned yet because in this first wave of promotion, they are focusing on Egypt and what Egyptian will face early in the game. When they are going to explore the Hittites in future promotion material, we might get more info on Greece.",

Frankly, if they want to focus on the Late Bronze Age, the Med and Ancient Near East paint a more comprehensive picture of the situation around 1000 BCE than the region they've selected. I struggle to believe this was a creative decision, frankly, because unlike Shogun, focusing on Egypt, Canaan, and the Hittites feels WILDLY incomplete. And if the focus was on Egypt, why not the Hyksos era?",

All in all the AI can be pretty damn good and brutal, in smart ways, but also still dumb as hell. It varies haha.",

It's good to hear that it's improved, but the fact that it still has dumb moments is disappointing to hear. It really breaks immersion when the computer faction just shits itself. I remember in Rome, computer units would often just run back and forward over and over, so you could just sit there and pick them off from a distance.",

I still love that game and occasionally go back to it, but yeah, sometimes, I'd be outnumbered, get a shitton of my units slaughtered, and then just win anyway because I had a cavalry unit circling the city with enemies hot on its tails while towers were picking them off slowly.\n\nStuff like that doesn't usually happen nowadays. Yeah, a big part of it is how different siege battles are now compared to the older games, but still, generally speaking, battle AI is much better. There's still some weird moments where it might react in a weird way or not react at all, but by and large, it's pretty challenging and uses decent tactics.",

Being able to move back your troops while facing the enemy reminds me of Manor Lords' supposed features.\n\nIt's nice that they talked about the sandbox nature of the campaign, the available winning conditions, battles, and the like but what is missing are the economic and empire/army building side. \n\nIs it just about conquering lands to gain legitemacy? Do you grant lands to vassals like in TW:Bretonnia? Are armies instantly made or do you have to wait for its full strength? How varied are settlements/cities? I hope they discuss more about these things in their next reveals/discussions.",

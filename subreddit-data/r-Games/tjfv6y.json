I'm not too well-versed in Witcher lore so feel free to correct me, but are there any other Witcher schools active by the end of Witcher 3? Wolf still exists but I don't think they have inducted a new Witcher in decades barring Ciri. Letho wanted to rebuild Snake but they kind of dropped that plot line in 3. Cat I believe is defunct due to extreme mutations corrupting it's members. And I'm not too sure about Bear and if they're still active. Would be a cool concept to make your own Witcher, but the state of the schools post Witcher 3 seems to go against this prospect",

Monsters were slowly becoming more and more rare. Witchers were good at their job, and growing human populations made more and more land inhospitable for monsters. It's why a lot of characters in the game would ask Geralt \"What will you do when the last monster is slain?\" They're asking in a hyperbolic manner, but it rings true. \n\nThis screams to me that the next game almost has to take place well before Geralt. Because if it's after Geralt then the game would take place in a world that's monster free. Could make a good story but not one I'm sure I'd want told in a Witcher game. I'd rather they go back in time to when monsters were more plentiful. And then they could have a lot more coop quests. In lore witchers often talk about working together, but we never see that anymore in geralt's days.",

They use black powder guns, silver swords, and harpoons to hunt aerial and aquatic monsters.\n\nSo, if there is a game that uses that, then I could see custom characters with one or two voices to choose from (like mass effect). It could be based on the second conjunction of the spheres with a brand new school (or Crane school), new main characters, and new story (hopefully less save-the-world).",

I have a feeling their disastrous Cyberpunk development process shone light at some engine issues that were too big (or rather, too expensive) to solve with their inhouse solution. I wouldn't be surprised if many of the features that were cut were cut because the engine wasn't made for that kind of thing and it wasn't feasible to do the ground level engine work necessary to implement them properly.\n\nUE has the advantage that it's been around forever and a lot of stuff has already been done. Not to mention it's gotta be a lot easier to hire new devs for projects based on UE than having to spend months teaching new devs your custom proprietary engine.",

And CDPR's PS4 and XONE port of CP2077 shows it. Compressing data in an efficient manner whilst having appropriate duplicates where necessary and managing the LOD streaming juggling is a delicate process. Make the LOD levels too high and all that extra margin that most games rely on when streaming from HDD is gone. \n\nThat, and other non-released tech. It's highly likely that a lot of stuff was worked on quite a lot, was not working properly and then work on simpler alternatives were started later on, leading to both delay and simplification.",

It was a gradual process of them starting to license out their engine, new studios no longer developing engines in-house as they became more involved, and so on.

I didn't mind the switch to turn based, after 7 games of the same beat em up style, i'm due for a change. But i was worried about overall tone of the game and characters.",

This'll definitely free up some resources but I doubt CD Projekt were ever under any major restrictions with older titles outside of hardware ones.",

Even if they have nailed the onboarding process (probably not the case, seeing how CP launched), I am certain that it takes months to perhaps half a year for new developers to get up to speed. And then to become proficient, probably several years.  \n\nI am currently a dev on a project which has been in development for 3 years by a team of \\~80 people. It took me about a month to start writing productive code and about 6 months to become comfortable enough to take over major tasks. Now try imagine having to learn from scratch a code base that has been in development for decades (yes, I am sure most of the code has been rewritten and rewritten multiple times since the first witcher, but I can guarantee you there are still unmodified lines of legacy code from that time which everyone is too scared to touch as not to break something else unintentionally) by hundreds of developers. \n\nOf course, UE5 is the same in the sense that it is a huge project, BUT it is public (so you can hire devs who already have expertise), has great documentation and learning materials (you cannot imagine how neglected documentation usually is for internal SW tools) and CDPR have probably negotiated priority support (whereas with internal tools, developers are usually very busy with ongoing tasks and have no formal obligation to fulfill support requests or provide help to other developers).",

A quick Google will show you that some users (even today) have to drop their core clocks below factory just to stop the games from crashing. \n\nGraphically and writing wise, both games are incredible. But once you start to strip away those components and analyse other aspects of the engine, you'll begin to see reoccurring issues that persist across both of them.",

Godot's not suited to billion-dollar companies - but Amazon, a billion-dollar company, is trying to do the same thing with Lumberyard. (Oh my god, are all their products deforestation gags?) \n\nMore importantly:\n\nDisruption always starts at the bottom. \n\nBlender used to suck. All 3D modeling and rendering software is fundamentally janky, but Blender stood out for being as old as Doom and showing it. But hobbyists and cheapskates used it because it was free. And it got better. And then some students chose it because it was free. And it got better. And then some professionals chose it because it was free. And at this point there's not a ton of reasons for any studio smaller than Pixar to start looking at Autodesk licenses. And Autodesk should still be worried because companies as big as Pixar can roll their own. \n\nLinux used to suck. \"Every computer crashes because every OS sucks,\" but Linux was genuinely some dude's homework, until it metastasized into a full Unix clone. But hackers and diehards used it because it was free... like, the other kind of free. Well, both kinds. Libre versus gratis. \"Free speech\" versus \"free beer.\" Anyway: it got better. Then 90s servers treated LAMP as the default package: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. And it got better. Then hardware and software companies started using free kernels instead of reinventing the wheel. At this point, Sony and Nintendo pick freely from permissive-licensed BSD components, every smartphone on Earth runs Linux-based Android or FreeBSD-derived iOS, and PC gaming pseudo-monopoly Steam released a handheld gaming PC that runs Windows games without Windows. Microsoft is not worried primarily because they have their fingers in everything. So long as you have to get Office by subscription they don't care where you run it. \n\nGodot and Lumberyard... already don't suck. Godot's downright pleasant for solo indie devs and small studios. Lumberyard, or whatever generic rebranding Amazon pulled out of a hat, is just CryTek. Only projects as big as this have compelling reasons to start looking at Unreal licenses. Whatever patents might protect whiz-bang new features, everyone on the internet is invited to come up with ways to say \"we could do something like that\" and make it work. Making games does not have to be zero-sum. Epic's not going to sweat because they sell imaginary hats, but Unity better hope devs still want to flip assets, or it's gonna be their assets getting flipped. \n\nEven when the industry-grade products are inarguably superior - $0 up-front and \"do whatever you want\" are really hard to argue with.",

Nothing about that says \"We will be releasing on Steam.\" Just that they won't be releasing exclusively on EGS.\n\nI have no personal issue with the game being an EGS exclusive. But this is exactly the kind of thing I can see people bringing up in 5 years to prove that CDPR \"lied\" about \"exclusivity\", because when fans of the Steam platform talk about exclusivity, they really mean \"not on Steam\".",

Doesn't look good imo.  \nThe big hammer does surprisingly low dmg on a regular trash mob, so it means the devs think \"bullet sponges\" as a valid difficulty mechanic, which rarely pans out good. And then the bow combo... Like really? Does everything need to be combo based? It's freaking bows, so just let it play like a real bow.  \nThe world building looks cool but I'm not sure if the core gameplay loop is fun.",

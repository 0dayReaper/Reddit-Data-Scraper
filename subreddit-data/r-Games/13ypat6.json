It had so much hidden lore and content to discover, and it gave players just enough mechanics to directly influence the game/story and throw curveballs (ha) back at the devs. And, like with most ARGs, you mostly engaged with the community, rather than with the game itself.",

Blaseball was great while it had relevance but unfortunately it maintained relevance by having them constantly, *constantly* work to get new stuff out the door, none of that stuff monetized it, and as soon as they took a break due to burnout the game was completely dead to the wider internet and late-stage Homestuck level impossible to crack into when it returned.

It seems like whenever Blaseball began to gain momentum in the community, they\u2019d shut it down for an unspecified amount of time. They\u2019d then bring it back months later, but with no real changes to the core experience. They talked about expanding the game, they built out their team, they mentioned some monetizing further down the line, all while continuing to say that the *community itself* is what made Blaseball, Blaseball.\n\nI struggle to see why they needed such long hiatuses, and such a large team, for what was essentially just a simulation running in-browser. I assume the backend of Blaseball must have had some extremely complex programs running to keep the simulation consistent, but it\u2019s hard for me to understand why they focused so hard on rapid expansion with seasonal updates and *no real plans for making money* when they could have kept it relatively simple and maybe kept Blaseball running today.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to hate, I just don\u2019t get it.

They could have made every team have a brand name for a season, the more unhinged and unrelated to sports in any way, the better. Call it the \"exploitation era\" and slowly increase the saturation and go super corporate hellscape with it to the point that players have advertisements in their names, every base in every stadium is branded, runs are called \"McDonald's\" now, wins are \"Caterpillar Heavy Machinery\"s, shit like that.\n\nThen after the era ends and some sort of storyline wrap-up where the league implodes into a black hole under the weight of corporate greed, and is reborn anew, settle on a *normal* amount of ads, like having little ad-read blurbs between innings and sponsored items/snacks and blessings and what not. Maybe even a banner ad below the Ticker. Oooh, you could even have a Patreon tier (super expensive during, a normal price after the exploitation era) that gets rid of the ads entirely.\n\nI appreciate that The Game Band tried to avoid ads as much as possible, but we DO live in a corporate hellscape. I think it would make the most sense to lean into that instead of withering away like they did.",

This came with the launch of a new website and a planned mobile app that was still in development. However, after 3 weeks, the website was glitchy, many features of the old website were missing and the promised mobile app was nowhere near release. Blaseball went back into siesta and the devs had been posting regular updates since.",

Thats basically a sim league you are describing. Every user makes a player and then you go through the minors -&gt; majors. Games are streamed on twitch in the OOTP engine. I don't usually plug stuff on Reddit but just kinda seemed up your alley.",

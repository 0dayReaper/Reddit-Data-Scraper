I have spent many, *many* more hours thinking about, listening to, looking at, and watching videos about Hylics than I have... actually playing Hylics. That video title (and thesis statement) is extremely accurate, especially in Hylics' case. I will add this video to the pile.\n\nEDIT: Ten minutes in, this video rules; definitely subscribing.",

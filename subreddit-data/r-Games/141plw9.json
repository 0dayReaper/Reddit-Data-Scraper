            "comment": "Guess I'll be the odd one out. Loved the game after initially not wanting to get it, but my ARPG addiction kicked in when it launched so just grabbed it anyway.\n\nCampaign was really great, and the final cutscenes were phenomenal. Gameplay is how I wanted it, which is not a typical modern ARPG - more resource generation needed, slower pace - but I can see why people wouldn't like it. I hope it's not changed too much.\n\nAs for endgame I'm enjoying it. I don't usually play much but I had the week off so put in a lot of time. Lots of different types of dungeons and world quests to do, plus tons of side missions still. The endgame so far has been a nice steady progression and I'm enjoying making my build.\n\nOf course they are working on Season 1, because that's when the battlepass kicks in and it's starting soon. The base game is completely \"finished\" - maybe some missing QOL - so I'd definitely expect DLC to be worked on now. I absolutely want to pay for an expansion pack and I'm not fussed about the other live service stuff.\n\nA few QOL changes, some slight balance tweaks, bigger mob density and season 1 is more than enough for me for the start of the games life span.",

This doesn't seem like it changes much, but in reality it can change entire builds. Now you can run the earth damage passives and key passive. Then it becomes finding the right legendaries that play off this idea.",

I heard it got better but the WWE quality acting and writing already had me at maximum cringe.\n\nD4, while not a masterpiece of writing, is SIGNIFICANTLY better. I only cringed once so far in about 30 hours. That\u2019s pretty good for a modern Blizzard game.\n\nGameplay wise, I\u2019m loving it a lot more than my (admittedly) limited time with D3.  Side quests are fun at first, but most are WoW-level (go kill x) or (collect 5 gore tusk) trash, with a few notable exceptions.  The world events get repetitive fast as they\u2019re all the same variation of 4/5 types of encounters.\n\nAll that being said, the combat and level progression is very fun. It feels like playing a sequel to Diablo 2, which is all I really wanted.",

CBU3 have my absolute trust in delivering a wonderful game\n\nThis part was probably the most interesting one for me: \n\n\"This is something that Sakaguchi-san, the father of FINAL FANTASY, and Kitase-san (FINAL FANTASY Brand Manager) have both said to me: FINAL FANTASY is whatever the director making the latest instalment thinks is the best game, the best story at the time.\n\nIf they create a game with those points in mind, then it\u2019s a FINAL FANTASY - so there\u2019s no need to feel constrained by what\u2019s come before. Since they\u2019d said that to me, I didn\u2019t really feel like this was a particular challenge. Of course, we hesitated and mulled things over, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was \u201cchallenging\u201d. Once we had decided on something, then that was all that mattered.\"",

They've been very frank with the shortcomings of the past decade in previous interviews and now they're admitting here that this is probably their biggest budget release of all-time. I'm very happy that they've finished development on schedule, 3 months before release with no extra day 1 patching needed, especially after the feelings that many FFXV fans had about the game feeling unfinished. \n\nMainline FF fans who have played XIV must be foaming at the mouth right now for this new XVI release. I'm hoping their confidence translates into an excellent quality game! I'll be buying it once the reviews come out given how things are trending.",

Starfield looks like Bethesda are ready to drop a classic too.\n\nNice to come out of an Xbox showcase feeling positive and impressed for a change.",

What here was XBOX only?\n\nIf you like cars, planes and pirates, XBOX has had you covered for the last 5 years, and they next five I guess.\n\n(All this to say\u2026still better than the Sony event last week)",

A lot more than just \"cars, planes, and pirates.\"",

Cars and planes are a core pillar of Xbox and will always be there, but they were actually in the minority as far as what was shown today.",

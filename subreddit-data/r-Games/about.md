Description:

The goal of /r/Games is to provide a place for informative and interesting gaming content and discussions.

Submissions should be for the purpose of informing or initiating a discussion, not just with the goal of entertaining viewers. Memes, comics, funny screenshots, arts-and-crafts, etc. will be removed.

Rules:

No content primarily for humor or entertainment: Submissions and comments that are intended to entertain rather than inform or discuss will be removed.

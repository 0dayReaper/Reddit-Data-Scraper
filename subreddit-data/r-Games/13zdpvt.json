You and I weren't there, we don't know what the conversations were like - and anecdotal or decontextualised online chatter and biased perspectives aren't illuminating.

You can get from the top of the station to the bottom in 10 seconds.\n\nThis is one drawback with the more cinematic style of modern games. Due to all the flashy animations everything has a lot more friction, and it takes a lot of time to get anywhere. Even something simple as more dramatic door animations can add up over time. This is why average time to beat for the original is 13 hours, whereas the remake seem to shape up to be 20 or more.",

I was really far from being convinced when video opened with high praises, but the more I saw, the more I understood. I don't fully understand it, but it seems those pixel-arty high resolution textures are doing wonders.\n\nIt's good to see UE4 stutter is almost not an issue, and game is performing as well as I would expect from such closed spaces, but what's up with lego floor shifting, like on 18:35 and 22:05? When camera moves forward, chunks of floor are visibly changing, not only gaining details but also becoming a little higher. I find it really distracting and I really hope it's something we can rid of with higher settings.\n\nI wasn't even interested in this game after playing demo few years ago, but this video definitely changed my mind. I loved Prey and this game looks like something that Prey was heavily inspired, and I'm not talking about space theme. Open approach to how to move forward, loud enemies, having to figure out everything on our own, GUI connected to game world.

SS1 is so old that it predates the conventional controls that things like Doom established. It uses ASDX to move instead of WASD. A and D don't strafe, they turn you because the mouse doesn't move the camera. [You can just look at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-NBXZq7TnE) and see how there's myriad ways it'd be extremely jank and outdated from a modern perspective.\n\nAnd while I haven't played the first one to compare, I think it's also just widely agreed that SS2 is a vastly better game.",

There's loads of difficulty options to tweak, the combat is engaging (I'm thinking more about picking weapons for encounters than I did with Bioshock Infinite, for example), and the way everything is physicalized really helps sell the atmosphere of being stuck in a meat-grinder/rat maze in space. I went straight from beating Tears of the Kingdom to System Shock and while the vibes are certainly different, I'm having about as much fun.",

Picking projects that build experience and expertise in a few areas then expanding to more areas with future projects. Even their next project, system shock 2, is building a new skill set for them with multiplayer, to probably eventually use that along with the expertise from this remake, to eventually test their game design chops with System Shock 3.",

They licensed that game to Otherside Games (I think thats the studio), which was then bought by Tencent, who now owns the license.\n\nThat said I do largely agree with you, there its for the eventual No One Lives Forever remake that the head of Nightdive wants or if it's something else.",

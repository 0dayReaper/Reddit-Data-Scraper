            "comment": "I feel like they took the development of this game too slow thinking they're the only one in the market having a shot at this genre of games. Yet The Demonologist appeared and I think it does it better in every aspect. Better ghost models, better scare jumps and map interactions...you have objectives after you identify the ghost...it's way more fun. I really liked the concept of this game, but it felt and it still feels unfinished. Hope they gonna improve it more and to be honest, I didn't checked the updates in like half a year.",

It's the 16th highest rated game on all of Steam.\n\nDemonologist has under 10K reviews.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, their strategy hasn't just been a winning one. It has made them generationally wealthy without having to inflate development stressors meaning they can keep working on this game til they die without ever worrying about money.\n\nThe last thing on these devs minds is competitor products usurping them.",

Comparing total review counts is absolutely unfair.\n\nPeople need to be careful with just because you were first, that you will always be popular. Battle Royale was capitalized by PUBG and had millions of players, until it crashed as people switched to Fortnite. Do people still play PUBG? Absolutely, but competition has absolutely taken a majority of the market share.\n\nAnd again on release timing. I bought Phasmophobia at launch and we have played it since release. When Demonologist came out, my partner could not put that game down and felt that Phasmophobia is a downgrade in comparison. At the pace competition is getting updates, I don\u2019t see how Phasmophobia can keep up unless they put that \u201cgenerational wealth\u201d back into development.\n\nBonus points for Demonologist being built on UE5 vs Unity. On my Steam Deck, Demonologist runs at full 60 fps with good visual settings compared to the unoptimized mess that Phasmophobia is. This means the game is more accessible to those with low end hardware.",

                    "comment": "Both games are fairly limited in their own ways. They are nice conceptually, but I don't think Demonologist really reinvents the wheel in a way that sets it that far ahead of Phasmo. Both feel more like they are still stuck in the concept phase and don't really know how to truly take things to the next level. \n\nPhasmo does better with the roaming ghosts and how you can try to survive/hide from a hunt. It's had more time to work on its voice recognition and ghost AI and since that's pretty much the most important aspect of these games, it remains a contender despite what other little flourishes one might think Demonologist has over it.\n\nDemonologist absolutely looks nicer and has more immersive maps with all the little jump scares. But those jumpscares do get old very fast and tend to be more annoying when the game overuses certain ones. It doesn't help that they do nothing to help you identify the type of ghost. It starts to feel like filler content to distract you from how long it takes for clues to appear despite the fact that you tend to figure out very fast which room the ghost is locked to. Exorcising the ghost adds an extra component, but in its current state it's very static to the map and feels like more of an added chore. \n\nBoth games have a fairly repetitive loop that can get boring quickly. Both have fairly slow development and show no real signs of really being able to elevate the idea of a ghost hunting game into something more dynamically entertaining. I think it's a genre that's kind of flying blind right now. There's something there that appeals to people but nobody really knows how to get more out of it in a way that feels incrementally achievable.",

                    "comment": "Absolutely agree.\n\nPhasmophobia on release was a breath of fresh air which is why it had a large following. As competitors saw there was a market for the genre, we started seeing clones that were either on par or even exceeded Phasmophobia on various metrics.\n\nI mentioned this in my other comment, but this reminds me of PUBG vs Fortnite &amp; future. PUBG may have been the first and had millions of downloads/players, but it quickly lost those players as competition brought superior offerings to the table.",

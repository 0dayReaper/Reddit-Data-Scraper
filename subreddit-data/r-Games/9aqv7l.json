Granted, most of this was scripted and we haven't really seen how the open world plays out yet.\n\nI like the population density and ambient chatter; it actually feels like a city unlike a lot of other games. The quest was simple, but it was very immersive which is a huge plus point; if this is indicative of the rest of the game, it'll definitely be GOTY for whatever year it releases.\n\nSeeing this guy accompany us in this segment makes me wonder if he'll also be there for open world adventuring, or if we have other companions who would follow us around.",

Especially in comparison to a Ubisoft demo.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not praising CDPR for having bugs in their game I\u2019m just saying that I have far more faith in a game with a gameplay demo that shows what the game is truly like and not some perfect and pristine look into a game that doesn\u2019t exist.

The demo shows the player behaving in a very civil manner outside of quest combat zones.\n\nIf the player decides to go crazy and open fire on a crowd, what's the response? There was a police building shown, so presumably there are police who will crack down on you, but what then? Can you run? Can you defeat the ones sent after you without having reinforcements called? What happens to the dead civilians? Do insurance mercs like TT show up for them? Do passersby gawk at the bodies, or just ignore them?\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, as promising as this early gameplay demo is, I'll be very interested to see how the future versions game will end up reacting to unorthadox player actions.",

This should be a thing when clashing with the police too. Just like the TT mercs insisted on the player taking 5 backwards steps after placing the transported person down.\n\nOh and intimidation for late game content should be a thing. If you are equiped with military grade gear, even if it's not a legal thing to do, others that are weaker than you should inspect you and then carefully decide what they are going to do. Of course for the police the opposite applies, the player wearing illegal augments should make them extra angry.\n\n&gt;Can you defeat the ones sent after you without having reinforcements called?\n\nThat honestly would be pretty stupid. As we've seen in the demo during one of the stealth takedowns, the individual units are linked together via networks. If one of the participants goes offline, at least an investigation for the area is warranted.",

Because for us, the fact that we're finally showing you Cyberpunk 2077 is HUGE. Please go to our forums, twitter, facebook, discord, and do tell what you think. Is the game world how you imagined? Do you see what we meant by \"immersion\" when we talked about CP2077 being an FPP RPG? How does our vision of \"cyberpunk by day\" make you feel? We really want to know.**\n&gt; \n&gt; Aside from that, we think we owe you a few words of explanation on why we're showing you this gameplay now, some time after industry professionals and media saw it at E3 and gamescom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each time we discussed the idea of showing the game to you (and we discussed this idea a lot), we were ending up in this \"we're not 100% sure\" limbo. Why? Because (for most people), when a game dev shows gameplay footage from their game, it means that this is how the game is going to look or play like. It's not the case here. Cyberpunk 2077 is deep in development. We have a lot of design ideas, a lot of mechanics being playtested, but we don't know what we'll end up with at launch. This makes publishing videos like what you just saw risky --we don't want gamers saying 'but in that previous video that gun was shooting differently', or 'why did you change the interface?'. Change is inherent to game development and there's a ton of things being modified each day. Our fear was (and kind of still is) that you'll think what you just saw is how Cyberpunk 2077 will look like 1:1.\n&gt; \n&gt; What gave us that extra confidence to show you a work in progress game? Good initial feedback from people who are accustomed to see games at various stages of development. What they told us (and they told us they really liked what they saw) gave us the boost we needed to show the current version of Cyberpunk 2077 to the most passionate and insightful audience --you.\n&gt; \n&gt; So... here's what Cyberpunk 2077 looks like today (or rather looked like when we recorded the video). We sincerely hope you liked it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, thank you for your patience and all the thoughts you shared with us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; CD PROJEKT RED",

I noticed it first (pretty sure there were earlier but this one was noticable) in Dex conversation. The first option was  \"Could be. Go on, sing your song.''  and after player chose this she said \"Interested? Sure. Tell me more.\". Why they didn't just put that dialogue in that box text choice then? I played Fallout 4 and really didn't liked that. I couldn't exactly figure it out what MC from F4 was going to say.

The game looks fantastic during the day-setting, however I think/hope the game is going to *shine* at night. That's why I think they've specifically chosen day-light for their reveal/gameplay footage. \n\nThis game at night is probably completely different when it comes to NPC interactions, completely different types of crowds is my guess.

I think it speaks volumes for the depth of visual storytelling acumen CD Projekt Red has. Yeah, games having destructive environments is pretty standard these days, but something about how the pillars fracture and dust flies in the air just brings back the tank fight in Ghost in the Shell and the lobby fight in The Matrix (which, granted, was also referencing Ghost in the Shell). It's a weirdly specific cyberpunk motif. You can have destructive scenery but you have to execute it right to get that perfect feel. It didn't feel gimmicky or \"woah, dat physics tho!\" level hamfisted. \n\nI can't help but feel like the devs must've intentionally decided to have that amount of destruction being shown off the same time they're showing off slow motion, in an intentional homage to the lobby shootout. \n\nOr it's just their engine doing its thing and I'm reading too much into this, either way, it was the little touches that made this demo for me.

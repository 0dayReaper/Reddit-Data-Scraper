Got the below from the cross post\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhiyidin_Moye\n\n\"Muhiyidin El Amin Moye (April 22, 1985 \u2013 February 6, 2018) also known as Muhiyidin D'baha, was a leading Black Lives Matter activist known nationally for crossing a yellow police tape line to snatch a Confederate battle flag from a demonstrator on live television in Charleston, South Carolina in February 2017... While on a personal trip to New Orleans, Louisiana, Moye was shot and killed by unknown assailants. At 1:30 a.m. on February 6, 2018, New Orleans police received a call about a man lying on the ground asking for help on Bienville Street. They found Moye with a gunshot wound to his thigh. A mountain bike was found nearby which had blood on it. Moye was rushed to the hospital where he died.[25] The blood trail went for some blocks where a bullet fragment was found.[26] As of late February, 2018, New Orleans police believe \"Moye may have been the victim of an attempted armed robbery.\"[27]\"",

For all male victims of homicide in California, guns were the most common weapon used. The Hispanic male firearm homicide victimization rate for that year was 7.88 per 100,000. That same year in the state there were: 174 white male firearm homicide victims (firearm homicide victimization rate of 2.27 per 100,000); 443 black male firearm homicide victims (firearm homicide victimization rate of 36.70 per 100,000); 59 Asian/Pacific Islander male firearm homicide victims (firearm homicide victimization rate of 2.07 per 100,000); and, 12 American Indian/Alaska Native male firearm homicide victims (firearm homicide victimization rate of 11.75 per 100,000). The state\u2019s overall male firearm homicide victimization rate for that year was 6.64 per 100,000\"\n\nCalifornia has easily the largest hispanic population of any state, and differences in citizenship likely make nationwide data sets more complicated. This is firearm murder, not violence as I was describing earlier though. You should browse this reference if you're interested.\n\nhttps://www.vpc.org/studies/CAlatino.pdf\n\nIt is interesting comparing the murder rate to the suicide rate by firearms- in America suicide is usually much more significant.",

(My roommate dated a cop and if he came over in uniform he had to leave his gun in his car and he did.) I didn't grow up with them and can never own one. \n\nBut like I said i'm passive aggressive and I've called noise complaints on them a few times. They were being extremely loud, blasting music, and it was well past 1 am. \n\nI've never thought about security cameras either. Again, I can't prove it was my neighbors that took my Bernie sticker. It could have been a different neighbor or rando... I do live in Mississippi. \n\nIf my pride flag goes missing I'll be more alert and buy a bigger one...maybe multiple ones?",

While on a personal trip to New Orleans, Louisiana, Moye was shot and killed by unknown assailants. At 1:30 a.m. on February 6, 2018, New Orleans police received a call about a man lying on the ground asking for help on Bienville Street. They found Moye with a gunshot wound to his thigh. A mountain bike was found nearby which had blood on it. Moye was rushed to the hospital where he died.[25] The blood trail went for some blocks where a bullet fragment was found.[26] As of late February, 2018, New Orleans police believe \"Moye may have been the victim of an attempted armed robbery.\"[27]\"",

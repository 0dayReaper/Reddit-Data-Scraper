The kids who are ruining their lives with the internet are the ones you see, because outrage feeds viewership. This is also just human behavior. We're built on gossip (read Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari), and the \"juicier\" stuff is what we want to hear.\n\nI tend to not ridicule children for something as simple as this little video, and call them stupid. Yes, children are stupid, but so is everyone by a certain metric. Why must children be mocked being mischievous in the same way they have for a very long time, but simply using social media, constructed by previous generations, to share it?\n\nAlso, who cares? The behavior of many 14-17 year old girls is not indicative of a _decline in the human race._ \n\nChildren will be obnoxious and evil until the end of time, because we are designed to learn and grow. Some may not learn and grow, but guess what, is not my, or your problem unless either of us are raising the child. Personally, I think if I were in the parental position here, I would support my child through change, and give them the tools to better themselves.",

Plus TikTok, like Reddit, isn't stupid if you watch things like gaming news, guitar shredding, some old guy that's really sweet making floats on Friday and Milkshakes on Monday, the luck. Stop being so fucking negative and realize that stupid Ness on social media is only common if you look for it. When you first make a TikTok account, you see more thirst traps than stupid people, and I saw no stupid people.",

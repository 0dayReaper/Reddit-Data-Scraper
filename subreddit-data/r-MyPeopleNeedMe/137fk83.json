It's almost like they don't know how to integrate adversity and setbacks with drama and fast-paced storytelling.  Like a failure of skill or something.\n\nBecause there are other productions that have no trouble with that.  The gun jams, or at least runs out of ammo.  The ladder comes unattached.  The hero doesn't have perfect aim.  The helicopter is hit, and the hoosegow gasket has to be patched with a new actuator so the hero can limp back, smoke pouring out, just in time to rescue their buddy, their love interest, and the six orphans they left behind or whatever.\n\nOf course things breaking at stupid moments can totally become an epic story.  In fact in my opinion it can make a story more dramatic and more memorable.  So I wonder sometimes why some writers are apparently just, \"Ah fuck it who cares, let's just say nothing goes wrong and they live happily ever after.\"",

You\u2019re really left flabbergasted because you never expect the hero to make a careless mistake. Then the movie has to deal with that and the plot evolves. I really liked how it was done in that movie, but I did feel like it was kind of dark for what is supposedly a kids movie. Didn\u2019t seem that fun. Very bleak at times.!&lt;",

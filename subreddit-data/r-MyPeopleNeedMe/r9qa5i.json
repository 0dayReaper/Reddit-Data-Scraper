So there was the thrifty white family, and the festive elsalvadorian family.  They didn\u2019t mix much, but I spent my time with both sides.  I find myself in the kitchen with a Latino grandmother, who starts giving me a back rub.  It\u2019s not a great back rub as she\u2019s 80-90 and her fingers are thin and boney.  But I figure it\u2019s a holiday and she should feel needed and all.  She says some slightly *off* things to me, \u201cI was very young when I got married\u201d, and \u201ca woman should sense what her man needs\u201d.  Anyway- her granddaughter comes in and observes this and says a couple things.  A few minutes later, one of her brothers enters the kitchen, pretending to need something.  A few minutes later grandma is told that they\u2019re ready to take her home.  Although I didn\u2019t really know the elsalvadorians very well, when I left, they made a few comments about how maybe they could meet my grandmother sometime, one called me *abuelo*, which means grandfather, and my friend threw a shoe at him.  I smiled and said she was a good kisser, but that didn\u2019t get the laughs I was hoping for. I drove home in silence, unsure if I had done something wrong that day. I don\u2019t think so.",

When you\u2019re going that fast you still kinda skip on the water no matter what and it tears at your skin a bit. It doesn\u2019t actually tear skin but it hurts. when the water suddenly catches you, and you slow down suddenly it\u2019s not pleasant.\n\nEdit: looking at it again they actually don\u2019t seem to be going that fast. It indeed probably didn\u2019t hurt. I guess the tubing guy really is satan.",

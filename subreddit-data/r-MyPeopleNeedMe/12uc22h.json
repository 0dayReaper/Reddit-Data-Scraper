            "comment": "MIDTOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- A manhunt is underway for the driver who fled several traffic stops and crashed through an outdoor dining shed before sending an NYPD officer to the hospital.\n\nDetectives said Thursday they are searching for a 56-year-old North Carolina man in connection to the wild scene on Wednesday night.\n\nExclusive video obtained by Eyewitness News on Thursday showed the suspect arguing with another man before asking an employee of the business to use the bathroom.\n\nThe man then left through the back door and that's when it all unfolded.\n\nThe driver was initially pulled over for improperly changing lanes on West 39th Street and 7th Avenue. Officers also noticed the Cadillac sedan had temporary Michigan license plates.\n\nDuring the stop, the driver produced fraudulent motor vehicle documents, and when police asked him to step out of the vehicle for further discussion, he instead sped off.\n\nHe seemingly did not care who or what was in his way.\n\nThe Cadillac then missed a woman with a walker by mere inches.\n\n\"The car kept speeding down the street. I was crossing from this side to that side. The car, I had the light. His wheel hit me down here and the bumper came flying off,\" said Jan Baldin, the woman in the video.\n\nThe black Cadillac was then located on Madison Avenue and E. 30th Street, and officers once again tried to stop the vehicle.\n\nWhen the driver fled the scene, he struck an officer and drove through an outdoor dining structure.",

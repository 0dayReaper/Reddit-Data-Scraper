Wore safety glasses and all that, but they weren't goggles and a metal splinter would make it into your eye at some point if you worked there long enough. Tweezers are too dangerous because the splinters are really small, so you would have to get too close to the eye, so earth magnets was the only way.\n\nUsually you just feel relief once it's out, but sometimes you can feel it moving around as you move the magnet in circles trying to get it to move. Would still get metal splinters from in my clothes for years after I left that place.",

The other main difference is college is optional, and the professors dont have to care or look out for you. If you are failing or acting a fool you can just be dropped and forgotten, they are not there to care for the individual.",

When you get older you see how little you knew and how unrealistic teens can be. They should not be treated as young children but they are not also adults yet. It is best just to treat them with respect and be real with them. It is the reason why teens and adults have never gotten along.",

When you're sixteen you know when you have to go to the bathroom, and your kind of \"all sixteen year olds are idiots\" rhetoric is the kind of thing that makes people in authority treat them like children.\n\nThere's a difference between twenty-five year olds and sixteen year olds, but there's also a difference between sixteen year olds and five year olds.\n\nAnd this isn't just something you brush away. Treating actual people like they are little more than toddlers does a lot of damage to them.",

But I literally saw Iron Man 2 with the principal/football coach, bible/history teacher, and my best friend, so that gives you an idea how close you could be with some of the teachers if you were respectful.\n\nOne time in AP Calc (I was the only student) the aforementioned principal and my math teacher decided to hit up Home Depot for some supplies for shop class later, I got to go along as a \"field trip\" after I called my dad to confirm it was okay for me to miss class.\n\nSo yeah, definitely depends on school, teacher, student doing it, etc.",

It's definitely true that they come with their own set of rules. \n\nMy perks for sucking up were stuff like being able to be sitting in the library lounge during class periods and never getting asked what I was doing, or being allowed to just leave and have the secretary mark it as excused without even asking (I lived right across the street and my father was on the school board, plus I ended up graduating valedictorian, so people just assumed I wasn't going to skip class without a reason, haha!)\n\nI can't say I miss high school, but there's something to be said for being a big fish in a small pond.",

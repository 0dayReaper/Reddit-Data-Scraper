She\u2019s too small to be either breeds and has a weird \u2018Mohawk\u2019 thing on her neck and back that she does whenever she thinks she\u2019s in danger). She came from a family of farm/working dogs and is instinctually the smartest and most loyal dog I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nEasy to train and so incredibly quick! I\u2019ve never seen a dog with the stamina to run for 7+ hours a day and still have energy to burn. She loves jumping and doing flips. She also loves to try and round up any fluffy white dogs whenever she sees them at the dog park. We take her for hikes, long beach walks and long walks around town, she seems to be adaptable to just about any situation and is so sweet and pathetic when she\u2019s in the house. \n\nHands down the best dog ever.\n\nEDIT: details and spelling\n\n2nd EDIT: Due to popular demand I\u2019m learning to imgur again so I can share some pics\n\nHere you go: https://imgur.com/gallery/eIXJw\n\nI also have some slow mo videos of her doings flips n shit but I\u2019m too dumb and impatient to make gifs.

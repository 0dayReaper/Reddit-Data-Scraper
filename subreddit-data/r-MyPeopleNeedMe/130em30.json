Lots of people \"park\" their standard vehicles in gear, instead of neutral, because it prevents it from rolling if the brake fails.\n\nIf it rolls hard enough though, and the key is \"on\" or it's  old enough not to matter, the force of the transmission turning will start the engine and then you just have the truck running, in gear.\n\nSince they loaded this truck backwards, they should have left it in R to avoid problems.",

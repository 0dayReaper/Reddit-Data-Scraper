They\u2019re elongated and fixed in place - the shape of their eyes greatly enhances their visual perceptiveness. In owls, this is exacerbated, but it\u2019s true for all birds. The muscles that normally move eyes instead are in their necks. This allows them to keep their heads perfectly still while their body does whatever motion - such as flapping to fly. It\u2019s also what gives birds\u2019 head motion that characteristic twitch and jerkiness.\n\nMost birds have a wide field of view, due to eyes on either side of their head, but birds of prey (and predatory animals in general, really) tend to have forward-facing eyes for binocular vision, as it greatly improves their ability to judge distances. Look at eagles, falcons, ospreys, hawks - forward facing eyes, and they can\u2019t rotate. They have to move their whole head, just like owls. \n\nWhy owls evolved such crazy necks is largely an unknown. It\u2019s unclear what selective pressure might have existed in their environments to drive such a change.",

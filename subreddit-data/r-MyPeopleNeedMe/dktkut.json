This is fun because in the same way small children might call a cow a \"moomoo\", the icelandic cutesy way of saying sheep is \"meme\", prounounced \"mehmeh\" of course. If we dare to venture further into this rabbit hole we find that icelandic youngsters refer to memes as jarm (singular) or the plural, j\u00f6rm. Jarm of course being the scientific/accurate word for the sound a sheep makes. \n\nThis has been Fun fact of the day. I hope you have a pleasant day.",

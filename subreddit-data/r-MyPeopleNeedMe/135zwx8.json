It all comes down to how we want to see things. The same thing can happen to you and me and I can take it as if it\u2019s the end of the world. You may take it has if it is an opportunity to grow.\n\nI have been insulted enough times in Reddit. Mainly because I don\u2019t follow the main stream thinking. I don\u2019t believe what the media, politicians, and what people in social media say. I actually research the subjects I care about. Such as gun control, racism, sexism, and so on. \n\nI don\u2019t let insults get to me. Simply because I refuse to relinquish my power to someone else who is trying to control the way I feel. And because I understand that they are ignorant and lazy to do their own research. \n\nDon\u2019t ever let others control the way you feel. You are more powerful than that. Insults are a reflection of them and the junk they have inside themselves that they project outward. We all have head that before. So much so it sounds like a cliche now.\n\nAbout the christian hell, I can\u2019t say whether that hell is real or not. No one can prove that there is a God, just like no one can prove that there isn\u2019t one. Believing in God is a personal choice. I can\u2019t say that you are wrong if you don\u2019t believe. I am not saying that you do or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know that. But I personally do believe.\n\nI have seen the miracle of prayer work for me. In ways that has blown my mind. It might be wishful thinking in the eyes of some, so what? If believing in God or a higher power makes us a bit better persons, and brings us happiness or peace, then who and I to judge others? I blindly believe in God, not religion. God did not create religion, men did.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe, I can respect that. Christians say that God gave us all free will. So obviously God respects your view too. Christians on the other hand are a different story. I can respect what they believe in but I have a had time accepting them shoving their religious beliefs down the throats of people. That is not what God is about. Even the Bible says that. Again, free will.\n\nAnyway, I went off again so I\u2019ll stop. Be strong, there is always hope. Have you heard the song Hi Ren? If not I\u2019ll put a link here. That is one of the most powerful songs ever. It has been watched over 11 million times in the last four months. That\u2019s because all of us can relate to what he says. I love what he says about hope at the end.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/s_nc1IVoMxc",

So that means that it could be forever.\n\nThere are some scientists that do believe in a God, not necessarily a christian God. Dr. Lipton in his Biology of Belief book talks about God. One of the greatest scientist in the history of mankind, Einstein believed in a God. \n\n \u201cIn the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who says there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views. (From The Expanded Quotable Einstein, Princeton University, page 214)\u201d~ Albert Einstein\n\n\"My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind\" ~ Albert Einstein\n\nBut anyway, like I said, it is a personal choice. Me believing in God as never hurt you. I don\u2019t go shoving my spiritual beliefs down people\u2019s throats. You not believing, has never affected me. At the end it is not about what you believe, it\u2019s more about tolerating others in order for everyone to be happy.\n\nBut let\u2019s imagine that science could \u201cprove\u201d that there is no God. Well, that still doesn\u2019t prove it. See, I studied biology and for several years in my early 20\u2019s I was involved in the field of human sex development. \n\nBack in 1906 we were told that what determine biological sex is two little chromes. Referred to as the \u201csex chromosomes.\u201d Well, I won\u2019t get into the ins and out of it, but something happened in 1998, two British scientist discovered a tiny little gene at the tip of the short arm of the Y chromosome. The so called male chromosome.\n\nThey took that little gene and they artificially translocated into the generic pool of a XX embryo. It changed the course of phenotype development from female to male. Scientists started referring to it has the \u201cmale gene.\u201d\n\nWell, just a handful of few years later, other scientists took another gene, in fact, they didn\u2019t even use the whole gene, but the \u201cimportant\u201d part of that gen, and replicated the same experiment. Magically it also changed the course of development and the embryos developed as males.\n\nNow that was news, because that gene is the SOX9 gene, and is not located in neither one of the so called sex chromosomes, it\u2019s located in chromosome 17. That is the generic sex can was opened, and boy did it have worms. In fact, of all the sex genes, inly three are found in the X chromosome and only one in the Y. The famous SRY gene. Which sadly for it, it is not even considered an important gene, but a facilitator for other more important genes. \n\nTo make a long story short and to get to my point, scientists have moved beyond chromosomal sex. Which make sense. The chromosomal sex theory could not explain why in the US (no one knows worldwide), 1 out of 20,000 born females have XY chromosomes and 1 out of 20,000 born males have XX chromosomes. Now we understand why and have moved far beyond the field or theory of chromosomal sex and into other fields, all the way down to molecules.\n\nSee, something that was believed for so long to be true and scientifically proven, has been disproven. Yet there are people, including doctors who a clinching to the chromosomal sex theory as if they were holding on for dear life.\n\nBelieving in science is no different than believing in spirituality or God. Both are based in blind faith. In science, faith in instruments and experiments and mathematical calculations. But how many times has science proven itself wrong? To many times to count. Yet they swore that they were correct and it was written in stone.\n\nMay be one day scientist will be able to prove that there is a God. Something it can be done right now with our current limited understanding and instruments. There are a lot of things that science can not explain, yet, or may never will. So people come up with all kinds of hypothesis to explain some things, such as mystical occurrences.  May be they are right, but may be not.\n\nAt the end sweetie, everything is about having faith in something. Wether is science with out limited understand and instruments. Or in some \u201cinvisible man in the sky.\u201d\n\nHey, it wasn\u2019t long ago scientists believed in the Big Bang Theory, the James Webb telescope has thrown a big rock into the working gears of that theory and has halted to a stop. I don\u2019t keep up with that to know what is the latest and greatest. I do subscribe to a NASA periodical that had an article about it.\n\nSince none of us really know what the heck is going on, and what is beyond death, what is real or not, may be it would be better if we all believed what we wanted as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt others. Keep it to ourselves and don\u2019t try to shove it down the threats of others.  In essence, live and let live, respect to be respected.\n\nThat is my 2 cents. My 2 very long cents. \ud83e\udd2a Be happy, because at the end, we all end our bodies will end up in the same place, either a hole on the ground or ashes. Hmm, unless you I am eaten by lions in some jungle, then I\u2019ll end up as lion poop somewhere.",

Science is theory based, of course, with experimentation to attempt to prove a theory, for sure, but Science is never blind faith and you are wrong to say that science claims things as fact that are then later revoked. Teachers do that sometimes, but that misrepresents how science works.  I feel very sad that people mistreat Science in this way.  Good people, like Dr Faucia, are under death threats for \"lying\" yet such Scientists are always very careful to say, \"the evidence suggests\" and \"the data at the time\" and so on.  This is where very similar views as yours are used in bad ways, that Science is just a form of Religion.  It's so very sad and dangerous.  Fascinating stuff on  genetics there, I must be older than you as that is a lot more advanced than the genetics I studied.  Love genetics; it was my favourite part of Biology.  But it's always the case that science advances and new and better theories come along.  Even with the Theory of Evolution, it's just the best theory we have that currently fits the known evidence.  It's not blind faith.  Thanks for your input.  A lot of the hatred towards LGBTQ+ people out there, yet you can see how science is revealing that it is a lot more complicated that just male and female. Thanks for taking the trouble to write all of that.  It was very interesting for me, and I totally agree with your sentiments, if not all of your opinions.  For me, and many atheist, having 1 shot at life leads to the desire to do the most good for others, for animals, and for the planet. Be happy too.",

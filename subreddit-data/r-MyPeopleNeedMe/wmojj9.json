It is one of the many improvements the Brigade has made since 2017 to equipment, training and procedures to enhance the response to high-rise fires and enable firefighters to provide a better service to London\u2019s communities.\n\nThese new appliances have three main purposes \u2013 to act as a water tower, a rescue tower and an observational tower. They will enhance LFB\u2019s response to a variety of incidents including high-rise fires. Firefighters will, in the first instance, always tackle a high-rise fire from inside a building and try to rescue people using internal fire escape routes. However, these appliances will provide an option \u2013 in rare cases - to rescue people from a window or balcony on higher floors and can also pump water to a greater height.\n\nThe appliances have built-in technology that will alert the operator if weather conditions, such as wind, are too great to be able to use the ladders safely at their fully extended height.\u00a0\u00bb\n\nhttps://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/2021-news/november/london-fire-brigade-to-bring-in-uk-s-tallest-aerial-ladder-into-operational-use/",

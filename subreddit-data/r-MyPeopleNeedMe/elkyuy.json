The best time to find them is at night. If you take a flashlight to the beach and shine it around for a bit, you\u2019ll eventually catch one in the beam. They freeze. Then, you can walk up to it and pick it up with one finger on top of the shell and your thumb on its underside (suggested method for larger ones to prevent getting snipped). If you don\u2019t want to grab it directly, bring a net and scoop it up. Take a few pictures, and then release. And yes, they are extremely fucking fast.",

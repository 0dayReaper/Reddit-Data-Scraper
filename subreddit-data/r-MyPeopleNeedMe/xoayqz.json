            "comment": "They're migrating upstream to find a mate. Once matured, a melon will return to their spawning ground every year, despite traveling thousands of miles through the ocean. Scientists think they use the earth's magnetic field to find their way back to the original river. \n\nFun fact: normally a melon is more streamlined and a dull grey shade. Only when it's mating season they'll bloat up and turn a vibrant shade of green, to attract mates. The males are of course the brightest, but the females also change colour and shape.",

I only mention it, because they dropped them into Lake Wanapitei from the North Wanapitei river, and floated them down from the Sudbury basin via the Wanapitei river ( feeds out of the south end of the lake) all the way to the shores of Georgian bay by way of the French River, where they were shipped to Chicago for rebuilding.  We lost almost all of our old growth to that fire.  That and early mining activities in the region.   There are still tones of old growth on the bottom of that river, all the way from Sudbury to the shores of Georgian bay.  I bet those would fetch a hefty price if surfaced.",

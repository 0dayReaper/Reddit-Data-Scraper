Absolutely lunacy, they 'foreclosed' a $200k house due to a supposedly unpaid $250 HOA fee, that my parents had documentation of paying. Fortunately for the HOA, they didn't manage to notify my parents until after it was sold.\n\nThey at least had the decency to sell it to themselves for a whopping $4000. \n\nFucking criminals. My poor parents went through hell, had their credit absolutely ruined, and never got any sort of settlement or restitution because HOAs have so many loopholes and the banks don't care as long as they get *their* money.",

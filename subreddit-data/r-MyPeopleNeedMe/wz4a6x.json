Using these, they could exchange individuals and small items, in a wide pass, without even slowing down.\n\nIf they could get rated to transport a pilot and an additional person or heavier cargo, this could be am effective way to transport prisoners and high value persons, or to massively increase efficiency of resupplying.",

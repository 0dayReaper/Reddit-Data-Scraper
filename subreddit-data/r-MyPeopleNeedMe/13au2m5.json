After I realized the umbrella was going to keep going up, I jumped off. I think I rose 3 or 4 meters.\"\r  \n\r  \nSadly, another man was injured by the falling umbrella. Mehmet Ali B\u0131\u00e7ak\u00e7\u0131 was knocked unconscious by the falling parasol, and also suffered broken ribs and a broken foot in the accident.",

After I realized the umbrella was going to keep going up, I jumped off. I think I rose 3 or 4 meters.\"\r  \n\r  \nSadly, another man was injured by the falling umbrella. Mehmet Ali B\u0131\u00e7ak\u00e7\u0131 was knocked unconscious by the falling parasol, and also suffered broken ribs and a broken foot in the accident.",

One of the washers was bolted to the concrete floor with four of what I think were 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide bolts. And the washer had managed to loosen the nuts on them so it was still jumping around like crazy. I know that memories of when we were kids sometimes don't happen the way we remember them, but I can swear that thing was literally jumping all the way off the ground.",

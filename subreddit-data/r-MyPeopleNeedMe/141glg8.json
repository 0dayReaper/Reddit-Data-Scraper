It always made massive waves that would send you flying what felt like 10+ feet into the air regardless of if you were able to hold on/stay on the tube or if you got flung off.\n\nOne time we were at my dad's cousin's cottage and his cousin was pussy-footing around going slowly and gently while his daughters were on the tube. His daughters were a few years younger than me, but my dad and I were heckling him over how he and his daughters weren't doing tubing right (my dad's cousin had a super fast ski boat with a 250hp+ motor on the back).\n \nEventually he let my dad take over driving the boat while I was on the tube. My dad proceeded to pull the Drop Box and sent me flying, bouncing all over the place. I somehow was able to hold on for a good long while, my back feeling like it was gonna break every time the tube landed because of how hard it hit the water before I finally got flung off the tube.\n\nMy dad terrified the shit out of his cousin and his daughters with that one, lol",

It got so dangerous that people had to start wearing helmets after my friend got knocked out.  \n\nAt full throttle the jet was strong enough to pull you off the tube if you were laying on a small tube with your legs in the water.  Lots of people lost shoes and shorts only going a few miles any hour just from running the thing full throttle.\n\nWe have done 50 on a tube.  That was when we were all dumb I was in my 20s would never pull that shit now lol.",

He was 4 years old in 1970 so he definitely wasn't carving his name in rocks. I'm sure your father saw some other old man with a dog, particularly since the dog in this video is too young to have been seen by your father. But it all has nothing to do with this video.\n\n",

Plus, they are people. It really isn\u2019t your place to comment on how others look. I\u2019m sure you have your shortcomings. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a lot of overweight people who are not lazy at all, they have metabolic disease from being fat. It\u2019s not a calories in calories out thing. \n\nBut anyway, I think many people agree with the sentiment, they just think the way you put it makes you sound like an edgy douche. ",

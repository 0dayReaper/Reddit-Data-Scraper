The difference is that sympathy is understanding from your own perspective, while empathy is being able to put yourself in their shoes, imagining what it would be like to go through that. \n\nUsually you have empathy when you have gone through something similar enough to compare. I can empathize with someone going though physical pain, but I can only sympathize with someone who lost a beloved family member.",

I just asked a question, and I didn't make any of the statements you inferred.\n\nI agree that people should be taught how to handle guns before handling guns.

What I was doing was pointing out that your face saving doesn't amount to much given the nonsense you spilled all over the place in your opening salvo. That should have all been clear if you took the time to understand what I said rather than trying to think up a snarky response. \n\nYou seem to think that the issue with your comment is about actuating the trigger, which may or may not happen depending on how hard that shotgun could hit a wall. But given the mass of the entirety of the shotgun compared to both the mass of the trigger and the structure of the trigger assembly resisting backwards force, it is more likely something on or in the shotgun would break first. \n\nThe real issue with what you said has to do with what you imply would happen if the trigger did actuate, which is something other than nothing. Unfortunately \"nothing\" is all that would happen. You can post videos all day long of accidental trigger pulls, it is not going to make your initial comment any more accurate.  ",

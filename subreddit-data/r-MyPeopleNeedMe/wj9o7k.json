The lead CI told me to clean it with the sprinkler and purposely left out that the sprinklers for the city were grey water. So my knee started getting infected. I told the nurse, and she put Neosporin on it and it just got worse SO SHE KEPT PUTTING NEOSPORIN ON IT. My whole knee was green and sticky(it was so gross) and there was a substitute nurse one day so I leapt at the opportunity to get some hydrogen peroxide on it to dry it out. And not even a a couple weeks later it was completely gone. \n\nI got to the end of this and realized that it\u2019s probably not actually a funny story lmao",

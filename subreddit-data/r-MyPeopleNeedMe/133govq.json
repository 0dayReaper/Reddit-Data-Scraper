People always wanted to play on woods/field courses because it felt more \"real\" but hyperball was more competitive, and you had better tactics because the team knew what they were dealing with and we would dominate people. This guy is like that, when you have people who come into the sport with 2 entirely different mindsets of, \"i want to larp and have fun dressed in tactical armor for no reason at all\" and the \"this is a athletic sport where my athleticism will prevail.\" I faced the same problem in college fencing, I'd say about 75% of the student fencers were just ren-fair larpers, where the other 25% of us wanted to win competitions.",

So this reply is more directed towards people who have an open mind but are on the fence about the game.\n\nI always thought \"wtf this game has shit graphics and simple gameplay, why would I want to play this, let alone buy it?\" I ended up buying a key for $1 back when people were selling their free windows minecraft key. It took me about a month, then I bought the game on java and a few months later, I started to fuck around with mods. The game is simply amazing. Sure, there's little to no story to guide you, sure there are some repetitive parts to get to the end, and sure it's pretty linear, short, and simple if you're just trying to get to the End. But the communities, the exploration, the automation, the building, and the modding aspects are all part of a huge system that gives you the freedom to express your creativity and ingenuity in a way few games let you. It's definitely not everyone's cup of tea, but to call it \"a poor attempt at a video game\" is just ignorant and a point of view that can't really be honestly and logically defended.",

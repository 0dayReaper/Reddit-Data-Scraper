Especially on a big, steel boat full of electronics.\n\nEven if it worked perfectly, it wouldn't be good enough. Mariners don't just want to know what direction they're pointing, but exactly *where* on the Earth they are. It's not very helpful for navigation to only know where North is and completely disregard whether I'm in the Atlantic or the Indian Ocean.\n\nInertial measurement units (IMUs) are a combination of (1) accelerometers that can tell you *where* you're going, and (2) gyroscopes that can tell you how fast you rotate. But because you have to take a whole lot of measurements and add them up several hundred times per second, noisy measurements mean they have a lot of drift, meaning using that strategy gets way worse with time.\n\nIn most above-surface vessels and devices, that's fine because we have very cool satellites that tell you your position to within a meter, commonly. Those will give you good reports every so often but react slowly to quick movements. So the common solution is to take GPS measurements as a baseline truth, and then fill in the details with IMU data.\n\nNow the big point: **Submarines can't receive GPS underwater**. So, if they have no GPS, they better have IMUs that barely drift at all. Normal IMUs drift in seconds or minutes, submarine IMUs drift in months. [These](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Apollo_IMU_at_Draper_Hack_the_Moon_exhibit.agr.jpg) (edit actually this was the one on Saturn V but submarines should be similar size?) are the  ones in a submarine, [these](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5158) are the ones used on your phone.",

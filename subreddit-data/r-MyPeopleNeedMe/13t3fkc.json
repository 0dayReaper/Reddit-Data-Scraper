If you\u2019re cruising along the green at the end of your ski day and don\u2019t know any better you\u2019d think the black was the only way down because it goes RIGHT TO THE VILLAGE where you started from.  Well, being so low on the mountain and it is subject to thaw/freeze cycles and can get icy.  The tradition at Vail is to sit at the porch bar right at the bottom and watch people yard sale it on that run.  Literally nobody takes it unless you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.  The cheers and jeers are obnoxious.",

On the night shift, we would check the snow guns on foot on the headwall of a diamond trail, and it would be ice (northeast) from being skied all day. Anyways, we checked every couple of hours or so, and this time we could tell everything was fine just by looking down from the top. But we still had to get down, so we went down on our asses. Granted, it was probably 10 degrees F but we went so fast I almost actually burnt my ass from the amount of friction. Learned a lesson that day.",

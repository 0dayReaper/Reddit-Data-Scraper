If the end speed of that second is 9.8 m/s, and the start is 0 m/s, the average speed will be halfway between the two values since for ex. 0.1s in will be averaged out with 0.9s in. That's why the average speed of anything is half of it's acceleration on the first second when started from a stopped position without drag.",

If you accelerate with a = g (9.81 m/s^2 ), after one second your *velocity* has an addition of a\\*t = 9.81 m/s. In this case the starting velocity is 0, so the velocity after 1 second is indeed 9.81 m/s. However, to get the displacement, you have to solve x from the pair a=dv/dt and v=dx/dt. Luckily our accelerarion is constant, as the displacement in the gravitational field can be approximated small enough to keep the gravity constant. This means that integrating x from the aforementioned separable differential equations will be rather straightforward and lead to x = v_0\\*t + 1/2\\*a\\*t^2 . Recalling that v_0 equals 0, we have x = 1/2\\*a\\*t^2 = 4.905 meters.",

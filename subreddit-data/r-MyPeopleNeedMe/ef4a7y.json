Using this method, I got his airtime to be 2.89 seconds. \n\nI\u2019m gonna use Newton\u2019s first kinematic equation to solve for initial velocity. This equation is: \nVf = Vo + at. \n\nVelocity at the top is 0, so we will use this to solve. As we are only finding time up, we shall use half of 2.89, or 1.445 seconds. \n\nThus:\n\n0 = Vo - g(1.445)\n1.445g = Vo\n\nThe kid has an initial velocity of 14.17 meters per second. \n\nNow that we have Vo, we can solve for height using another kinematic equation. This equation is Xf - Xo = Vot + 1/2at^2. In this equation, X represents position. We shall consider the kid\u2019s original position to be 0, so then we can easily solve for his height.\n\nXf = 1.455g(1.455) - 1/2(g)(1.455)^2\n\nXf = 20.76801525 - 10.384007625\n\nXf \u2248 10.38 meters\n\nSo, the kid went approximately 10.38 meters high, with an initial velocity of 14.17 meters per second.",

Since the acceleration downwards is g = 9.8m/s^2 and there's only 1 second of free fall, we get 9.8m/s so about 10m/s.\n\nIf we say 3 seconds, we have 1.5 seconds of free fall. Then we get 9.8m/s^2 * 1.5 which is about 15m/s.\n\nI don't know how much a kid weighs, but if we say 30kg and choose the 3s airtime, he's got a momentum of 450kgm/s. I also don't know how much a football player weighs or how fast they run, but if we imagine they run at 7m/s and weigh 130kg we get about 900kgm/s which is twice as much.\n\nI don't know where I'm trying to get but TIL football players are massive\n\nAnyway, height at 3s airtime would be mgh = mv^2 / 2 which is around 10h = v^2 / 2 which is 10h = 225/2 = 112.5 so h = 11 \n\n11m",

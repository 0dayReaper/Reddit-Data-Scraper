This bridge is half supported by the dock, so it needs to be light. It needs to be strong enough for people to walk on it. The bridge also has to be able to support it's weight when on wheels, as it is rolled down to the water's edge. It needs to be rugged enough to survive storms and the continual abrading of muddy waves for decades. These requirements leave few materials other than metal available, and when cost is factored in, there are no viable non-conductive materials.",

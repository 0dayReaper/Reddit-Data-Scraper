Dude did not understand how to drive his pavement princess in those conditions.\n\nFor those wondering, hitting the gas when you've lost traction is a great way to spin out. Instead, remove your foot from the pedals and focus on staying in your lane. Without the added torque from the motor or the brakes slowing the wheels down, they'll get traction back as they stop going faster or slower than the ground is. Once that happens you should have some level of grip back and you can gradually slow yourself down, pull over, and  chance your pants.",

How are so many people struggling to understand that? \n\nI'm willing to concede that ABS isn't perfect on ice but it's better than accelerating by a wide margin and still effective enough to say its not a bad idea. I'm guessing the \"sliding across two lanes\" is because people overcompensate in the snow. \n\nIf you want to argue it's situational fine, but instructing people to slam their brakes is a safe bet.

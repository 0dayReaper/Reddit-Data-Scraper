                    "comment": "I used to be a zoo keeper, and the amount of children that I had to negotiate with about not bothering the animals was crazy. \n\nAt my zoo, people could only touch certain animals if the animals gave them permission. Like wallabies coming to the human side of the yard could be pet on their backs. We almost never let kids touch most of our reptiles, only a select few that we knew were comfortable with it. \n\nBut the amount of kids that would *argue* with me about what they were allowed to do near the animals was infuriating. No, you can\u2019t climb up after the goats, that space is their private space to take breaks from people. No, you can\u2019t climb the rocks to get to the wallabies, that\u2019s their space. Please don\u2019t try to touch the snake I\u2019m relocating, let me put him in his travel box please. No, don\u2019t pet the wallabies on their faces or bellies, that annoys them (and if you pet the wrong one the wrong way, she *will* punch you). When other keepers were taking their tortoises, opossum, beaver, etc. out for a walk, it would take *several* keepers to keep kids out of the way. They ask kids to stay a couple feet back so the animal can wander around freely, but kids would close in *constantly*, so the keepers and volunteers had to form a protective barrier around the animal nearly every time because of the children\u2019s behavior. \n\nAnd the parents rarely help. At all. \n\nI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t let kids mess with a lot of the smaller animals. I couldn\u2019t fathom working at a place where kids would have free access to small reptiles. That\u2019s how you end up with stressed, dead, or injured reptiles. That little guy was in fight or flight mode, and it costs a lot of energy to run off like that. He was definitely stressed if he felt the need to make a break for it like that.",

Of course if they weren\u2019t kept in such confined and terrible conditions, this wouldn\u2019t be as much of a necessity.\n\nNo, chickens don\u2019t give a single fuck about each other.",

Hens establish a pecking order with unspoken rules and an order, kind of like how a bully can fake a punch to make a nerd flinch and take their spot in the lunch line. It determines who gets first dibs at the best food, the best roosting spots and the best laying spots. \n\nNotice how the small brown one gets pushed out of the way by the two bigger white ones, and the rest patiently wait in the back? They\u2019re smaller and weaker than the orange and white hens so they\u2019re bullied and pushed to the back.",

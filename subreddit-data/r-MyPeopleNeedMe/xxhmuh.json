They don't care for their brood like some other fish do, so if they didn't die during spawning they would likely eat their own babies. This gives their babies the best chance at survival.\n\nIf you want to see a more supportive fish family, you could check out cichlids. Mom guards the eggs diligently, and once they hatch she keeps them safe in her mouth until they are big enough to swim fast. Then she continues to keep watch over them until they are ready to defend themselves. Dad isn't in the picture for them, though. \n\nI think the best dads in the fish world are probably seahorses, because the males are the ones that have to endure pregnancy and birthing. But they don't stay with their babies after birth.",

Then the same thing happened when you were done. This happened every single time. And it happened to everyone. We get used to it. These aliens transport us everywhere. It's 30 years later. Roads become disused and built over. Cars become abandoned and sold off for their scrap metal. There are a few neigh sayers but all in all, society lives with this new paradigm. \n\nThen suddenly, it just stops. You see people walking out their house and just... don't get moved. Millions, hundreds of millions of people all leave their house. Wave their arms. Jump up and down but... nothing. The government is in absolute crisis. How do we get these people to work? How do we get food to people who need it? Hospitals need doctors and supplies. Nevermind that, how are people going to get to said hospital? The world utterly collapses for 10 years as the gears of transportation VERY slowly start to turn.",

Because humans live longer, the effects of lifestyle changes take longer to become noticeable, since generational turnover takes longer.\n\nMany fish spawn only once and then they die. If we meddle with the reproduction of wild fish, we might not get the results we are looking for.\n\nI don't think there is anything too horrible about what these people are doing, especially if their intention is conservation, but if you allow *all* the fish to reproduce and you take away that physical challenge that they are biologically programmed to want to overcome, then it *is* possible that there will be a future generation of these fish that cannot naturally make that up-the-river trip.\n\nThis is the concept of domestication in a nutshell...animals becoming completely dependent on humans for species survival.\n\nSo yeah. While the human analogies/comparisons that we use might not exactly match the experience of these fish, it *is* possible to have a future generation of fish that won't be able to swim like nature forced them to.",

They are only removing the effects of the obstacle we built.\n\nI doubt that's gonna hurt the evolution of the fish",

This looks like something to boost population quickly after habitat restoration and appropriate mechanisms for retiring to spawning grounds have been put in place. \n\nBut otherwise I agree. If we put this in place permanently, it could reduce the environmental selection for ability to pass waterfalls and fish ladders, etc.",

In reality comparatively little of what we do in fire and EMS is imminently life and death(and most of what is falls on the medical side). Whackers live in a fantasy world where who they think they are and who they actually are tend to be very different.   These kind of people are generally looked down on by experienced career firefighters and paramedics for a reason.  In addition to just being generally annoying and giving the profession a bad look they tend to have a real talent for making a scene way more complicated than it needs to be.  Keep in mind the idiot in this video took off running to \"go help them\".  How helpful do you think it's going to be when some rando turns up dressed like that demanding that he's a firefighter somewhere else and should be allowed to jump in and run equipment?",

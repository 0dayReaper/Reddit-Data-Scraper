Overnight they can easily crawl into a pump and get chopped up, and kill everything else in the tank.\n\nThey also can sting everything around them such as expensive coral.\n\n\nAlso another cool thing about anenomes is you can literally cut them down the middle with a blade and each half will grow into an individual anenome. A genetic clone.\n\nThey reproduce by splitting themselves in half, so this just is a way of making it happen on demand.\n\nEDIT: all these species are anthozoa.\n\nWhich means they are animals that have no central nervous system and can't feel pain.",

Their cells still communicate with a nervous system to coordinate, but they dont have an actual brain capable of \"feeling\" in the sense we are familiar with\n\nThat's why their neurotoxin defense is in every cell. Every cell has a spring loaded \"harpoon\" that if touched injects it into whatever touches it. Its each cell individually reacting, without a central nervous system. \n\nWhen you get stung it literally feels like youre getting snagged onto the tentacles, due to the harpoons. Im also apparently allergic to anenome venom so when I tend to my aquarium I wear gloves. \n\nWeird right? Jellyfish and coral are the same. Some animals literally cannot experience pain.\n\nThis branch of the animal kingdom evolved very differently and are really alien compared to anything else.\n\nIve been doing reef aquariums for years and am endlessly fascinated by it.",

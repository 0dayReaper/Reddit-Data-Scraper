A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but is different from Western pinball in several ways. First, a pachinko machine uses small (11 mm diameter) steel balls, which are rented to the player by the owner (usually a \"pachinko parlor,\" featuring many individual games in rows), while pinball games use a larger, captive ball. The pachinko balls are not only the active object, but are also the bet and the prize.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/MyPeopleNeedMe/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

It was in the centre of a great big jungle gym type indoor play/climbing area where the ultimate goal is to get to the top to jump into what you see in the gif. When you got to the top of ours, it had a walkway that went out into the middle of this spider-web of big black elasticated strips like in this video that you jump into. \n\nThe layout is criss-crossed like what you can see there but with about 10 layers of these elastic strips so you'll land in one eventually and you'll just bounce up a bit before falling back down until you get to the bottom which was just a bouncy castle floor (I think they're called a bounce house or something in the States).\n\nThey're amazing amounts of fun and the only really dangerous part is if you go too soon after someone else and the snap back from a strip they landed on catches you.

They salvage what they can and clean and remove all oils and chemicals. There is designated disposal areas and permits need to be applied for.     \n\nOn the plus side these scuttled ships create artificial reefs and within little time become great spots for fish to thrive. Aside from a few hiccups in the learning process it\u2019s seen as mostly beneficial to wild life.     \n\n[Info on reefs](https://ocean.si.edu/ecosystems/coral-reefs/when-wrecks-become-reefs)     \n[link to EPA outline for scuttling](https://www.epa.gov/ocean-dumping/disposal-vessels-sea)",

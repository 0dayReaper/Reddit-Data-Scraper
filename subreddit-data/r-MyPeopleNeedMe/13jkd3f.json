Like a lost tire going down the freeway is fine. But a lost tire changing lanes and going around a curve like it's passing people is great.\n\nThis was fake pixels going in a fake direction in a non-candid, scripted moment. So, like, none of those things.\n\nThis skit would be fine on TikTok, but it doesn't make sense here.",

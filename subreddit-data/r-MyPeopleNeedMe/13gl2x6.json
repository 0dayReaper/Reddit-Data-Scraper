And the way they just wheelie off into the distance lmao, literally couldn't have ended better.\n\n3rd jump definitely looks like they have some sort of pitch control, ya reckon they have a special system for that or is it just some sort of effect of making the wheels spin slower or faster?\n\nEdit: Woah the answers I've gotten on this question (thanks!) really improved my understanding of reaction wheels in vehicle control. Like, you can have roll control too if you could spin the left and right wheels independently as well right?",

Those lanparties are symbolic in my mind of this strange twilight era we went through at the dawn of true instant global communication, and at the end of the cozy, safe feeling night of actually all hanging out in somebody's basement or living room or garage. Like we had the rudimentary pieces of what the world is now, but we were the last that experienced our particular brand of freedom. We went into the woods and fucked off completely from society. This was both normal and healthy.\n\nIt leads to some interesting reflections for me personally. It felt like as I was coming of age and finishing high school in 2006, a big switch flipped and the future started happening. We went from having arguments about goofy shit like whether birds have dicks that would last for a generation, to having the literal entirety of human wisdom, insight and intelligence aggregated and beamed into our houses. It's almost like humanity was growing up alongside me.\n\nIt's boomerish and obnoxious but damned if it doesn't still blow my mind. Like right now, if I want, I can learn everything that is known about berserkers. I could watch lectures by anthropologists, historians, ancient combat masters, and self-important larpers. I can peruse comprehensive notes dig into sources, including peer-review and academic citation. I can figure out how to install ignition coils in my Nissan Altima, or make a goddamn perfect bananas foster with caramel Gelato and a nilla wafer crumble.\n\nBut at the same time, I can never go back to the relative feeling of safety or innocence I once had. There was a time where one school shooting- columbine- threw our entire society into an uproar. People were burning albums, crying on national news having impassioned arguments. I can never not know the approximately 60 apocalypse scenarios that we are blithely hurtling toward. I can never be free of the constant ticking of variables, each spelling doom for my son and all I love, as they all, one by one, click into place. The modern omens of the modern prophets we call scientists. The only *real* prophets.\n\nI could never have imagined the hope and sense of awe I feel in my chest when I look deep into the cosmos with the JW scope. But I can never sleep quite as soundly with the memory of Funkytown. As always, balance is maintained. But goddamn, what a challenging, terrifying, beautiful and magical time to be alive.\n\nWe are doomed, there is no hope, entropy is crushing us all one at a time. And it is, by far, the best time to be alive.",

You can feel safe that your kid, or you, will not break it. \n\nWe used to look for very long outdoor stairs to send it down, or cliffs to send it off of, where we could walk down and retrieve it. \nOne of the most entertaining toys my child ever owned.

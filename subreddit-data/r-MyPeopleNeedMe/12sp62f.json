And it burns spectacularly and hot. Seeing how phone batteries or hoverboard batteries burn, it\u2019s pretty scary to think about such a huge battery. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s multiple safety devices present, but once it burns, it *burns*.\n\nWell I agree, electric drivetrains are pretty fun to drive. It\u2019s amazing having all the power available instantly, especially while overtaking. I did notice myself driving more aggressively due to it haha. But personally, I love driving so I feel EVs have no soul. It\u2019s pretty monotonous. I couldn\u2019t care less about being there fast, it\u2019s about the experience. I love making an engine scream and having a range of gears, I can decide if I want to cruise along or aggressively overtake. I like having that control. EVs are pretty much a drop in replacement for autos tho.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is batteries are *heavy*. And until we get higher densities it\u2019s really difficult to cram more energy into them. As increasing capacity means added mass which in-turn takes more energy to move in the first place. I saw a video recently of Volvo\u2019s electric trucks, the ice had a range of 1000km and the electric was just 300km, even with the cab being smaller. Also batteries are sensitive to temperature, too cold or too hot can drastically affect range.\n\nLesser maintenance is a good selling point, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be a factor for sales. But I hate the fact that higher acceleration/range can be paywalled or subscription based, for a fucking car lol. Personally I feel ice and electric can coexist, if we can find alternate fuel sources. The energy density of gas is the main reason it\u2019s so popular now. And, filling in a tank of gas is much faster than charging a battery so that\u2019s also something which I\u2019m not sure how we can get rid of.",

And that is a big problem rn for fire stations because in the case that an electric car battery does catch fire it can\u2019t be put out with water. Like you said it also burns incredibly hot so you\u2019ve got a blinding fire that can\u2019t be put out with the means that a regular response team would have. \n\nThat being said figuring out a proper response is kind of the only solution here. Technology won\u2019t stop moving and companies like money so EVs will still be sold. We can bemoan the fact that EVs are potentially dangerous in that regard while they still get made and sold or we can find a workable solution for response teams and create greater safety regulations. Gasoline in cars was certainly many times more dangerous when it started. Safety regulations went up though it took a while. Hell, the Pinto was exploding at minor collisions in what the 70s? And fire fighting solutions/building materials were not ready to handle the quantities of flammable liquids at high speeds gas brought around in its inception. \n\nAs far as weight EVs absolutely have the disadvantage there but they also have the torque to counter that. The Hummer EV is 9000lbs with a 0-60 of 3 seconds flat. That is a commercial size sports car. Now THAT is dangerous especially to surrounding vehicles with the raw power and speed and weight in one place. \n\nThat range issue is definitely a thing especially at larger vehicles but honestly I don\u2019t see it as that big of an issue. Some people need range, current gen ease of maintenance, speed of refueling and those people will stay with gas. Long haul trucking, rural housing, farming all need diesel or gas absolutely. But city outskirts into city living. You drive what 20-50miles a day on the high end in many cases. Plug in your car when you get home and you\u2019ll never need more battery. Over time the speed and infrastructure is built up so maybe you make the occasional trip long distance with planned stops to enjoy scenery and recharge. \n\nDefinitely a wide topic to cover but I think a lot of people, who electric honestly likely wouldn\u2019t work for, discount electric vehicles as a whole. Say you need that range then don\u2019t get electric but let electric work for the short ranges and heavy loads it thrives on. \n\nLong response I know but I completely agree with everything you said. Also I definitely get the driving fun part. I like older/slower cars cause they may not be track cars but they make everything feel fast. A sports car just makes the regular road boring. But electric go karts make a tiny indoor track back into a 40+mph track with such rapid acceleration. Rapidly changing tech with lots of room for improvement for sure. I just want to see it given the freedom to go from ok/good rn to amazing and even more useful.",

I agree, electric is still in its infancy, can\u2019t imagine how good it\u2019ll be with the pedigree of engineering behind it. Modern ice is a feat of engineering. So many intricate parts at such tight tolerances, moving at thousands of rotations per second making explosions to produce energy. It took many decades of advancements to be where we are today. And when you think it\u2019s peaked, it gets better. The first ones obviously sucked and people were sceptical, but without all that development we wouldn\u2019t be at this point. This will also cause advancements in fire response so it can be made safer. Obviously not everything can be avoided, but we can drastically reduce the effects. Funny enough, we had electric cars a hundred years ago back when gas was still new and had to be hand cranked\n\nThe Hummer is basically a tank lol. I guess weight can be helped by packing in more density and/or lighter batteries, but yeah still more research needs to be done. I\u2019d be scared if one was behind me, due to the inertia it carries and as more people drive distracted. Lane assist and adaptive cruise enables this, but no system is perfect. Autonomous driving can solve this but I feel it\u2019s a long road ahead for it to be mainstream.\n\nAnd I completely agree with city ranges. EVs are perfect for that. Many PHEVs out now do ~50mi on the battery alone which is perfect for going around the city in complete silence, and having an ice for longer trips which is pretty cool. Dismissing electric as a whole is really narrow minded, there are use cases where it\u2019s plain better. Like small trucks for last mile connectivity. With denser cells, it *might* work for medium range but that\u2019s up for debate.\n\nI am actually living with this exact use case, here electric bikes and scooters are gaining popularity as people are realising they\u2019re perfect for the city and dirt cheap to run. My bike has a range of ~50mi with spirited driving and its perfect for city limits. I need to plug it in just once a week, my commute is insanely cheap. I have my car for longer trips to stretch my legs. Charging infra is definitely the backbone for EVs, it\u2019s being built up albeit very slowly.",

That\u2019s a really solid range either way. What is it if you mind me asking?\n\nYea though man the size and weight of accessible passenger vehicles is stressful. It really makes light city oriented vehicles less and less safe as the focus of protection turns increasingly to the driver at the surrounding traffic\u2019s detriment. Hopefully having a greater percentage of self steering and braking vehicles will help with that. It\u2019s kind of an inverse problem to itself of people letting their cars drive more and being more distracted therefore facilitating cars needing to handle more of the driving to compensate for stupid. \n\nAlso have you ever seen the Canadian guy making the diesel electric trucks. Edison Motors on TikTok and that\u2019s his company. Using a Cat diesel generator to provide continuous low RPM efficient energy into the battery fuel cells. Then the electric motors can provide greater torque for short distance heavy hauling such as logging in his case. Pretty cool. Just adapting an existing idea in locomotives into heavy semis where it hasn\u2019t gone yet. That way the fuel is used up as efficiently as possible as well since it\u2019s always at ideal RPM without the 20 shifts that a semi truck would usually need to do to get to speed.",

Sorry bout that. \n\nLithium fires are dangerous, but from what I\u2019ve seen EVs have protections for the batteries. There are huge contactors which physically disconnect the battery and atleast in teslas, the cells are enclosed in a metal housing. Not saying it won\u2019t happen, but we can reduce its effect. Lithium fires have a specific class of fire extinguishers so maybe something like that on a fleet when they become more common. I think there was a Tesla on fire which was on the news sometime back, but you usually see phones spontaneously combusting(usually due to a faulty charger) or low quality products which don\u2019t have a proper battery management system. EVs are better in this regard, with proper systems and even liquid cooling for the batteries. \n\nIt\u2019s also in the manufacturer best interest to make sure it is safe, as headlines like \u201c4 cooked to death by EV fire\u201d isn\u2019t exactly good for brand reputation, and liability. I can see electrics getting cheaper over the years, but depending on what you need a vehicle for, I\u2019m not sure if it can replace it. Time will tell, I guess.",

The big issue is that a battery (esp lithium) doesn't have to be on fire to be making heat. So even if you put it out (usually the electrolyte burning) it's still shorting and dumping a bunch of energy as heat, so it just lights again, and again, and again until it's either depleted or covered in sand or something to an extent where it won't reignite. \n\nSo generally if you're playing with lipos, a bucket of sand (or a bucket of salt water if the cell isn't damaged) is your best bet. Unfortunately most fire crews don't have a dump truck of sand with them, and dumping flaming cars into the ocean is generally frowned upon. Definitely something that needs to become more developed as more EVs enter the roads.",

Was actually about to mention engine braking but realised with the advent of hybrid/electric cars that's basically a moot point.\n\nAll things being equal it'd be my preference to only have to pay for brakes/brake pads (granted my knowledge of handbrakes that don't ratchet is severely lacking). The brake pedal on my poor pregnant rollerskate from '97 gave up the ghost on the way home from the blood bank **once** and the handbrake was my only method of bringing the car to a full stop (and even that was difficult). Now it's a habit to **NEVER** go without it (so much so that others having to drive my car complain that it's pulled on too heavily).\n\nP.s it also doesn't hurt that forgetting to apply/remove the handbrake is (soon to be was) cause for an instant fail in the finals of my country's driving lessons/road rules course.\n\nP.P.S You can call me a cheapskate but when the cost of replacing a worn gearbox is more than the vehicle is valued/insured for, brake replacements for peanuts is a weight off my wallet.",

You could calculate the actual torque a car on a slope would need to get moving. It\u2019s tiny compared to what the engine can put out. There\u2019s no reason at all for someone to not leave the car in gear. \n\nAnd since you brought it up engine braking is also not bad. Here\u2019s a video on it. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/sNbMXJ2_yqU",

Decent practice to put the [handbrake on first in most cars](https://thebrakereport.com/parking-shift-to-p-or-pull-the-handbrake-first/).\n\nLikewise a good idea to use the handbrake at intersections because if you're rear-ended you foot can come off the brake pedal and your engine drags you into T-bone city.\nHandbrake on in the same situation, unless it's a very large/heavy or very fast moving vehicle doing the rear-ending (at which point you're probably stuffed regardless), you're less likely to end up in the path of oncoming traffic.\n\n[From the NZ driving test site](https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/how-and-when-should-you-use-your-handbrake-or-parking-brake/)\n\n&gt;*If you have your foot on the brake and someone hits you from behind, your foot will lift off the brake and you\u2019ll hit the car in front; the handbrake will absorb some of the impact.*",

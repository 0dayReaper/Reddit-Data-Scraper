Still the issue persists, and although it's irrelevant to this case, it should not be forgotten.\n\nHowever, city-wide biking services do exist, and as far as I've been able to tell, they're not an issue at all, at least in the city I live in. Actually, plastics and all other sorts of trash are way more common than discarded bikes, which I haven't seen a single of. I think the claim that people will throw them away is wildly exaggerated when there's no evidence to suggest that that's an issue to begin with.\n\nThere are a ton of problems in the city I live in, homelessness being one of the biggest ones I can think of; but pollution due to bikes is not one of them.\n\nAs for biker recklessness, I've seen way more recklessness from drivers, one of which almost ran me over trying to avoid traffic by driving on the sidewalk, and cars are way, waaaaay more dangerous than bikes are.",

Honking is stressing for everyone and most of the times it doesn\u2019t help the situation. It also takes good driver skills and experience to understand when honking is appropriate and when it is just a source of stress. In my case, I was riding in a foreign country and while I did not lose control over the situation, I was still shit scared because I did something illegal and also dangerous to everyone on that road. Not to mention all the rocks and debris on the side of the street I had to navigate, so the honking was not helpful at all",

Hilariously ignorant thinking cities don't have bike lanes or public transport (though I'll admit it's definitely not as efficient as europe).\n\nYall also gotta remember most people in the US would still drive. It's more convenient and comfortable than public transport and most people wouldn't want to give that up. And then there's people like me who live 30 miles from work and it only takes me 25 mins to get there because I just hop on the highway. There's no way in hell I'd take a bus even if it was available, and in a large portion of the US like where I live, public transport just isn't feasible since everything is so spread out. We have busses that go from small town to small town, but you'd still have to usually walk 20+ mins after getting off the bus to go to most places since they stop in the middle of the city and everything is so stretched out.",

They're typically kinda gross, crowded and filled with weirdos/creeps/ actual dangerous people. Even if its more efficient than cars, and even if it's faster so people use it, they still would vastly prefer a car due to comfort and convenience if they're not driving in a major city where it's bumper to bumper traffic. \n\nAnd our bike lanes run parallel to the major roads and beside sidewalks separate from the roads with crossing points to where you can get to the road/cross to the other side every so often. Sorry you've only know about America from videos of here, but, and this may shock you, not everywhere in the US is a rundown shithole major city.",

It's not economical. It would literally cost hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions just to have that done in the small towns near me. You're talking a literally unfathomable amount of money to do that for the whole country. Like more money than exists on earth levels of expensive. \n\nOur public transport takes you from little city to little city that are dozens of miles from one another. So if you live in one small town you can get a ride to the next one (the busses go to 6 small towns in a row and then back) but unless you work on main street you're gonna be walking a bit. The 2 \"big\" cities with populations of 50k+ have busses that go from district to district in the cities, but you're still probably walking 5-10 mins after getting off.\n\nYou don't seem to actually understand how big the US actually is lol. Once again, you're coming off as uneducated and just assuming your solution will work here as well. It won't.\n\nYou also say \"if you have to walk it's not public transport lol\" which is the stupidest fucking thing you've said so far and really shows you have no idea wtf you're talking about. Nearly ALL public transport requires walking some distance. Its not like the fucking subway takes you to your doorstep of your apartment, or that your bus takes you directly to the front door of your job. That goes for everywhere in the world bud, not just the US. Maybe the bus stops right outside your job, but for everyone who doesn't work where you do now they're walking a few minutes at least to get to their jobs. The train/bus/whatever stops in *areas* not each specific building.\n\nYou're obviously just part of the \"hur dur America bad!\" Crowd who don't know what the fuck they're talking about and who think theyre so intelligent that those dumb americans just dont see the solution, but of course you do since you're *so smart*. You love to act like you understand the US and could easily fix all its issues while not even understand said issues in the first place or even knowing anything about the country. You've seen our major cities on TV or visited them yourself a couple times and now you think you know how to fix the whole country when you've seen 0.0005% of it. You also say dumb shit like \"drive these things that drain their bank accounts to their slave jobs\" lol. You're obviously not worth having a conversation with.",

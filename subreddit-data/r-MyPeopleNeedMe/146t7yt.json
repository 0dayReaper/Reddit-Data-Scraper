His show took place in China at the beginning of August. Reports said the artist's creation was a tribute to his grandmother who just turned 100 years old. Gouqiang lives in New York City and he is best know for using gunpowder in his wondrous works.\"\n\nhttps://www.wdam.com/story/29858030/video-chinese-artist-creates-firework-ladder-in-the-sky/",

Cai Guo-Qiang is not only known for his impressive displays of fireworks, (including burning kites and \"daytime\" fireworks that explode into bursts of colored pigment,) but also for paintings that are actually made out of gunpowder. \n\nHe'll set a canvas down, lay out gunpowder in specific patterns, and then lay another sheet on top of it, weighed down with like, rocks and shit, and detonate the gunpowder, leaving an image literally made out of gunpowder residue. The journalist in question doesn't necessarily indicate that these are separate art forms, so they're suffering a little by being ambiguous, but they're functionally correct in asserting that \"fireworks\" and \"gunpowder art\" are distinctively unique.",

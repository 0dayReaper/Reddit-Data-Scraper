I honestly don\u2019t know what system/rules they have setup for off the clock squad car trips, so I really don\u2019t have an argument. I was just airing a small thing that bothered me without having the actual data to back it up. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for all agencies, but here there have been a number of off duty cops crash their squad cars while driving under the influence of alcohol. With that in mind, my thought was our tax money shouldn\u2019t be a perk for their off the clock activities, especially if they are breaking the law in the process.",

Because addiction is a disease and last time I checked you can\u2019t lock up a diabetic until they are no longer diabetic. JFC.\n\nEdit- one more thing, methadone isn\u2019t free. Depending on what state, patients pay out of pocket if their insurance won\u2019t cover it. There may be some states where it\u2019s free, but the goal is to cost the state less in theft and burglaries by replacing heroin/fentanyl with methadone. In other words, it\u2019s more expensive for the state to deny them treatment.",

They didn't hit any cars, but hit the curb on the opposite side which launched the 19-year-old arrested man out the back window. The kid ran and was caught a little later and slapped with a bunch of charges (he turned a misdemeanor into several felonies). The car continued to run off the road and hit several things including the fence that flipped it over. Firefighters cut the officer out of the car and he was life-flighted to the hospital where he recovered.",

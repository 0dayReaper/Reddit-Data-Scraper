If this were in a slot canyon, it really would be that dangerous.

The adhesive degrades, and if you crack or bend or in any way compromise your phone, the protection quickly becomes useless. Some newer gadgets use what is known as a \u201cnano coating\u201d to keep bad stuff from reaching sensitive components, but even that can degrade over time.\n\nSpills shouldn't cause any concern, but if you like your phone, don't submerge it.",

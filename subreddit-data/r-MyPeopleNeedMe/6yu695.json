He paid to have it fixed up, so there's that.\n\nThen we just had a brief brush with Harvey and I look out my window to see his damn trampoline upside down in my yard.  No stakes or anchors hanging off of it either.  He had learned nothing.  Although I wish he had hit the fence again in another spot.  Get this shit fixed up piece by piece.

The one about injuring the dog, will rely on whether you use a harness, collar, head collar or something else. Likewise if you're being a vigilant owner and keeping an eye on what you're dog is doing, majority of the time you should be able to see if a situation is about to happen, and take steps to avoid it.\n\nBesides what's the difference between a sudden jerking stop at the end of a retractable lead, and the end of a standard one? Having experienced both, very little tbh. \n\nAlso yes I do include cumbersome as a negative, if I'm using a 10m training lead, that's going to be a lot harder to reel in quickly, than a retractable one where the lead is constantly trying to reel itself back in. For me the retractable is simply faster and allows me to respond better, and that's with a 30kg German shepherd. It also let's me enjoy my walk with my dog, allows her to have freedom and explore, without risking her off lead and leaves my hands more free if I need them. But if I'm just out at night walking around my neighbourhood, of course I'm not going to use it, because that would be asking for an accident to happen. \n\n\nI'm not saying it's a perfect device, I never have, I'm simply saying that to just label everything as good or bad/dangerous isn't productive.",

When I\u2019m in public with her, I know when to lock it and keep her near. (It\u2019s the heavy duty one for 150lb dogs) I feel like I have more control with a retractable than I ever had with a regular leash. \n\nWith a regular one, I\u2019ve gotten rope burn, I\u2019ve gotten tangled, and I\u2019ve even had issues with a 20ft lead getting ran through poop in a field. \n\nNever once have I been flung through the air or dragged at the end of a retractable.

Also, it encourages poor leash management. Anytime a dog just runs up to my dog it\u2019s almost always because they are on a retractable lead and the owner isn\u2019t paying attention.

With a retractable leash. She can still freely walk around. But can\u2019t suddenly run away.  \nShe is also scared of other dogs. So it also allow her to walk a circle around them.

Someone was stopped on the right edge talking to someone else, and their dog was on the left edge of the trail, right after a blind turn.  Luckily I was able to skid slide and not hurt the dog.\n\nI will agree they do have some good use cases, like letting your dog go explore some during a walk.  But if that leash is not locked majority of the time, then that person is more than likely allowing bad behavior traits to develop.",

When you have a normal lead you can put your hand through the loop and then hold onto it with it over your wrist. Also you can hold the lead further down giving you a second point of contact. Retractable leads are great in situations that you don\u2019t trust your dog completely off the lead but want them to be able to run off and do there thing like on a nature walk. But for day to day walking a standard lead is so much better for control. I always used to use two leads attached together so I had a handle half way down and on the top lead have a knot so you have three lengths and loads of control.",

I could control the dog with a retractable lead but a normal one was much easier. I had the different points so that I could control how close the dog was to me at different points. For example walking down a footpath no where near the road with grass on each side boy got the full 2.5m. Walking near a busy road got maybe 1.5. Crossing a busy road he would be next to my knee. \n\nUsing these techniques allows you to train the dog really well too. Within 6 months I didn\u2019t need to do anything but say his name and he would be right where I want him and I just pick up the slack so he doesn\u2019t trip. \n\nHe was 42kg dog and not overweight. And not even the biggest dog I have walked. Also dog breeds with a strong hunting instinct it\u2019s easier for them to launch without you expecting it.\n\nEdit: forgot to add I would often be walking more then one dog at a time.",

They\u2019re incredibly smart and more so then dogs tbh. Google any list of intelligent animals and more often than not dogs are not even in the top 10. Dolphins are consistently there tho and research suggests we still don\u2019t full comprehend how intelligent they are.",

If she is unwilling to do those things, though, she is not being a responsible pet owner.",

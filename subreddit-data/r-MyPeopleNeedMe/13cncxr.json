KC/MO has a [downtown freeway loop special enough to have its own Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Loop_(Kansas_City)). It\u2019s a tight loop. I\u2019m from Houston originally, and even in that city obsessed with freeways, I\u2019ve never seen anything like our loop in KC. \n\nLocally, we joke about 2Q, however, the exits actually go up to 2Y. The loop has 23 exits, all starting with the number 2 because all the freeways that converge to make the downtown loop are in their 2nd mile. IH 29, 35, 49/US-71, 70, 670, and US-169 all contribute to this shitshow, as well as one state highway, MO-9. \n\n\nA few fun facts: \n\nWe are about to bury South Loop and build another park on top of it. KC is known for its [Dept. of Boulevards, Parkways and Parks](https://kcparks.org/about-parks/boulevards-parkways/) system. \n\nThe MODoT is considering converting the North Loop back into the old 6th Street Freeway, which would actually be a boulevard (a status that has a special meaning in KC/MO). \n\nKC Metro has the most freeway miles per capita over any other metro in the US. \n\nKC is known as several nicknames, but my favorite is Paris of the Plains, because of our intricate and functional (and largest system except for Paris\u2019s)  boulevard system and also we have more fountains than Paris, and some argue more than Rome. \n\nPlease come visit. It is beautiful, classy, cultural, friendly and happy. The weather sucks 8/12 months; it\u2019s either too hot or winter, but otherwise, it\u2019s awesome here.  This time of year and late September through around Christmas bring us the best weather.\n\n\nThe [Nelson Atkinson Museum of Art](https://www.nelson-atkins.org/) is a very large world class museum that rivals the Met, Louvre, Chicago, etc, but our museum is free for everyone. We play soccer on the Nelson\u2019s lawn, and wander into the galleries to use the restroom or take a drink. We also have tons of jazz, and we\u2019ll fatten you up on the best barbecue anywhere - low and slow, sticky and sweet.",

You went through a good point on the focus part on your own so I'll skip that but there's also the feasibility part.\n\nIt's easy to make the cars higher quality because animation-wise, they do not require so much processing power. it's just 4 wheels rotation and that's it. maybe also mirrors and windows' animations if you're going REALLY realistic. the cars are also usually like 12-24 at most in any one given match.\n\nThe crowd is a whole other different beast. fully animated human bodies ( Read: quite possibly 47+ different moving pieces if they were completely animated and realistic looking, for EACH body ). multiply that by the number of people for any crowd ( which could easily go between hundreds and thousands, depending on the scenario ) and hopefully you can imagine how ridiculous it can all start to sound\n\nSource: Am Gamedev\n\nEdit: Who's the asshole that downvoted me?!?\n\nIf you really think you have a reason to believe I'm wrong at least get your ass here and show me why, otherwise you're just proving to be pretentious, delusional, and a coward",

They can't even host a single split invitational 24h race without the servers melting down. \n\nMeanwhile in 24h from Friday to Saturday, iRacing hosted 4800~ drivers across 90 splits for the Roar before the 24. \n\nNext weekend they'll host 10k+ drivers for the 24h of Daytona. \n\nDefinitely worth the price tag to have such competition that's openly accessible to all rather than made exclusive and done badly.",

Plain and simple. \n\nBut, there\u2019s a lot of rich kids in the sim racing community, as well as the real trackday community, so they don\u2019t tend to worry about money like most. A club I can afford, but really wouldn\u2019t want to be in. And I speak from sim racing and real trackday experience. Bunch of pretentious fucking asshats from what I experienced over the years. The trackday lot are the absolute worst. They\u2019ll give you the cold shoulder if you aren\u2019t part of their \u201cclub\u201d, and are especially petty if you\u2019re quicker than they are. Kids with expensive toys, don\u2019t like being rinsed on the track by cars half their size and guys twice their age. It\u2019s funny, but kinda pathetic. \n\nBut as for iRacing, nah, not my thing. Its a circlejerk of fanboys in an overrated game. But they\u2019ve spunked so much cash on it, they HAVE to tell everyone how amazing it is all the time, in order to justify the cost.",

It could communicate with the elevators and basically hijack them to get where it needed to go. It also had priority, so if there wasn't enough room in the elevator it would hold it until people got out so it could get in. Of course with a stretcher, there was not enough room for this giant robot. So we would have these ridiculous stand offs with it occasionally until they fixed it. It was kind of a stupid robot.\n\n\nApparently people trying to ride it was a big problem. It had a sensor that could tell if someone tried to get on it and would call security. ",

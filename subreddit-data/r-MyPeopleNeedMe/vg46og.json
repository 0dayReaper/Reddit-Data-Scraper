Once it dips below -35 with the wind chill I start trying to spend less time outdoors but it's fair game up until then. Lotsa fun things to do out there in the snow, y'know. Keeps ya nice and cool so ya don't overheat. I'd rather be outside in -15 to -20 than outside in anything hotter than 30 degrees. At that point you're just sweatin' from yer pits to yer tits and it's no fun. Gotta change yer glitch at noon cuz it's drenched in sweat. Summer is blegh, especially with all this heatwave nonsense. \n\nI say if it's gunna be chilly, why not embrace it??",

Also, LSD is not an interstate, and this is a **big** distinction, as interstates have standards that would make waterfront access more prohibitive. LSD, for example, has pedestrian lights at various places. An interstate would never have them. So, you\u2019re being more misleading than helpful to those who don\u2019t know it.\n\nIf there is another large city in the U.S. that gives its people more (and more accessible) recreational space along its lakefront (or any waterfront, for that matter) right from its urban core, I\u2019d be curious to see it. \n\nSeriously, accusing Chicago of standing out for having an inaccessible waterfront is just disingenuous. Literally *every* major city by the Great Lakes has a literal highway between it and its lakefront. Cleveland, Toronto, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Toledo *wish* they had half the public-park acreage that Chicago has along its waterfront.\n\nEdit: \u201cI **frequently visit** Chicago. LSD splitting off the shoreline absolutely is a **tourism problem**.\u201d Leaving the rich (if likely accidental) irony of this comment aside, the only \u201ctourism problem\u201d Chicago has is having [a *ton* of visitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Chicago).",

It\u2019s arguably the largest protected shoreline in any major city in America. Not all of it is beaches because our beaches are constructed, but all of it is dedicated public parkland. Lake Shore Drive is the defining line establishing where development is allowed, and it has bridges or pedestrian tunnels roughly every block for much of its run.\n\nThat road both creates access to the lakefront and protects it from development, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s absolutely not a tourism problem.",

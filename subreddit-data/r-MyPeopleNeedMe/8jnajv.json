Black Widows (which live in abandoned areas) and Brown Recluses (which, as their name suggests, are recluses and avoid people as much as they're able to). Both will not bite unless you press them against your skin, and Brown Recluses are only native to the lower half of the US where it's warmer.\n\nEvery other spider is a friendly neighbor who keeps the population of mosquitoes, centipedes, and other annoyances in check! Let them stick around, and they'll pay their rent by being your personal exterminators. :)",

It might be unconventional to the human palette but I can assure you it is nutritious and wholesome. The last time a bowl was turned down it was perceived as a serious slight and caused an incident that rocked the human-spider relations so hard we still feel it's reverberations today. Did you know that the Web is not just a garnish? It's perfectly acceptable to eat the silk and it's considered wasteful to leave it behind. I can recommend the deep fried insect shells with moth hummus. Do not accidentally mistake a discarded arachnid exoskeleton for a fried insect shell, you'll make a serious fool out of yourself and will be the amusement of the entire party. It's a common pitfall for those not acquainted with the hospitality of spiders. If they try to pass you some of their glandular moonshine though I urge you to not partake. It's not fit for consumption by animals due to its incredible potency, and the last time I had some I woke up naked on the lawn with dicks drawn on my forehead. ",

My dumb ass, when I was about ten, found a black widow on its web with an egg sac hatching and hundreds of little black spiderlings pouring out, and I went and grabbed a stick to poke the web with and try to catch the large female Black Widow.  Of course, the momma spider didn't react as sluggish or timidly as I had expected.  The momma black widow makes her way over to where I'm poking the web with a stick, and skitters her way up the stick with some serious speed.  By the time I withdrew the stick and had it *near* the jar in my other hand, she was halfway up.  I barely got her into the jar without getting bit.  \n\nSo yeah, moral of the story: don't mess with a momma spider, they can be atypically aggressive compare to non-momma spiders.  ",

Only small children and those with compromised immune systems like the sick or very old. \n\nBrown Recluses bites are also less likely to kill you but they will rot your flesh from the inside out and the healing process is very painful. Basically, if not immediately treated, the venom starts to eat away at the flesh causing redness at the bite site that often looks like a target. To heal, a medical professional must scrape all the infected tissue out and then pack the wound so it doesnt leave a giant hole. Again, rot your flesh, scraping the infected tissue out and packing the hole left behind = fuck this I want to die, level of pain.\n\nFuck those brown assholes, at least black widows are very territorial towards other spiders.

Otherwise, some have body-hairs that can cause irritation if you touch them or breathe them in, but that's it.\n\nMost tarantulas are actually fairly docile though.

We all tend to be a bit more relaxed later in life and Mrs. Lassup is no exception. After battling depression caused by no longer being the star of ESPN, she slowly came to a stop with her intense training regiment. 2 years prior to this photo, Beth received a Save the Date card in the mail. Her best friend was getting married and she would inevitably reunite with old friends again... Old training partners... She couldn't stand the thought of embarrassment from her friends seeing her in the condition she had allowed herself to succumb to. 24 months later, to the day, this picture was taken. \"everybody jump on 3\" Taylor said. Beth smirked, and at the count of three, those 1996 Wisconsin State Championship legs turned veiny and hard and she jumped. An impressive 17' vertical and it's documented on this historic photo.",

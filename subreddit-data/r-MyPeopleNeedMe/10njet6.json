I have to up a 16ft ladder to look for something that was most likely out of season but somebody wanted and I couldn't fake being busy enough to not go look. So I'm probably a good 20ft off the ground on top of a shelf. When one of my coworkers moved the ladder without me noticing since I was right next to  speaker. When I finished looking I went back to the latter only to see it gone. Per company policy, I didn\u2019t have my phone on me. I ended being stuck up for like 20 to 30 minutes before someone finally came back to the stock room and could set up the ladder for me to come down.",

I called a coworker, but he was 15 minutes away. Then the thunder and lightning started booming.  I managed the courage to hang from the building edge and drop about 10 feet to a connected buildings roof.  Bruised my heels pretty bad.  The people in the building I landed on heard the thud thinking the wind had blown something off their building and opened up a roof hatch to investigate, rescuing me.",

So let\u2019s assume he is only 40 feet up even though given how much too went down I would estimate more like 60. He now is tied into a chunk of wood weighing hundreds of pounds falling toward the top that is going to lay on its side pretty much creating a ton of nice wood spears to impale him. Then the chunk he is on might roll....over him or throwing him. He COULD survive but it\u2019s not likely.",

People with damaged PFC would have all the typical signs of pain such as flinching, twitching, spasms etc. But would report not being in pain. Bunch of involuntary movements we typically associate with discomfort but without the actual experience of it. Opioids would dull the outward symptoms of pain but users with damaged PFCs would say it made no difference. Possibly similar to when we drugged up fish. To say they for sure don't or do is something we just don't know at this point but we can make educated guesses on species that are closer to us on the evolutionary tree like mammals. Interestingly every study/experiment to prove animals have theory of mind has been disproven as of a few years ago. Every example of ToM was later discovered to be a byproduct of other mechanisms like tracking. Humans as a species have such strong ToM we project it on to other creatures.",

If we outlawed all hunting and fishing for the sake of individual animals, we would be in an even worse ecological disaster than we already are. At least that is how things work in the US, can't speak for elsewhere.",

It's why we're able to confine individuals with Alzheimer's/dementia against their will or prevent children (lack of development) from leaving the home, those with mental disabilities/illnesses from owning weapons, and others who lack the capacity to consider their actions (say most prisoners). Rights are granted and rescinded all the time. Ultimately it's a matter of their capacity for rational thought/communication. However, we can also extend rights without a third party being involved or by proxy of kinship/ownership. The first right is the right to life since all other rights derive from that. Always an odd thing to talk about animal rights but at the same time saying we're allowed to eat them. Imagine saying humans have all kinds of rights including freedom from torture but they can be killed and eaten at anytime.",

Especially when you are talking about deep sea fishing. In some cases, because a fish is used to a certain depth, the act of catching them just kills them outright. Fish are also more exposed to predators in the ocean after they have been released if they are tired out. Most of my experience is in fresh water fishing where you typically target bass or other larger fish that are themselves predators. The only thing that will eat a freshly released tired bass is another larger bass (depending on where you are fishing). You should also be doing your best to make sure that a fish is fully revived and can fend for itself before you release it. Florida is also a huge tourist destination. I know many states have separate tourist and resident limits for hunting and fishing. I would argue that Florida needs to re-evaluate. If it is more harmful to allow this level of fishing when compared to the money they make to fund conservation then they need to adjust. I would imagine there is a lot of pressure to allow tourists to do as they please because it makes the state a lot of money (hotels, restaurants etc.), but that isn't good conservation.",

He had a show called river monsters for a long time where he travelled all over the world catching gigantic fresh water fish, in at least one case, discovering a new species. I am paraphrasing, but in one of the episodes he says something to the effect of: the fish that he catches are ambassadors for their species. By subjecting them to what is an undoubtedly unpleasant experience, he is raising awareness of species and helping folks care about protecting ecosystems and the wildlife in them. On multiple occasions he partnered with biologists who were studying the movements of fish, and the only way to track them is to catch them and tag them. Its a traumatic experience for the animal for sure, but in return, those scientists are able to better study and understand the migration habits and population of the species. And all of that helps us make sure that the wild populations are healthy. \n\nIt's actually fairly common when hunting for birds to find birds that have tags from biologists that are tracking their migratory patterns. When you kill one of those birds, there is a phone number on the tag to report where and when you shot it. This helps them survey populations and migratory patterns as well. Those tags are entirely useless unless you have hunters out in the field killing those birds and finding those tags. This is what I mean when I say it is a net positive for the species. Individuals may be harmed/killed, but in return we are able to gather the data we need to make sure that the whole species does not go extinct.",

It would also be nice if we provided housing for the homeless, ended hunger, and provided Healthcare from tax dollars. But unfortunately we do not. In my opinion, it is because we collectively have a very hard time recognizing the inherent value something has, we instead determine the value of things based on their usefulness to us. Clearly the American public does not care enough about conservation to fund it from tax dollars, or else we would already be doing it. You know who does care about making sure the deer population is healthy? Hunters. If there are no deer, there is nothing to hunt, and no humanely sourced meat as compared to factory farms. \n\nI'm not saying it's a perfect system, but it's the best we are going to get unless a whole lot of people start caring a whole lot more about conservation.",

I wouldn't be confident saying that certain animals don't have feelings. Just because they're not mammals. \n\n&gt;As recently as 1999, it was widely believed by medical professionals\u00a0that babies could not feel pain until they were a year old\n\nI mean bees have been found to do things just for fun.

A lot of places will use a \"topical anesthetic\" so they can technically say they do use it, but that doesn't do jack shit and they don't wait long enough for it to kick in even if it did.

It has to burn for a while before the tank reaches enough pressure to throw vapors into the air and go boom. So you're not that much more likely to die if you crash. Whereas having more difficult cargo increases your chanch of crashing in the first place, increasing your chanch of dieing in an accident.",

Truck cabs don't have roll cages and although any trailer is heavy enough to delete the driver through inertia, that's multiplied by liquid surge. Milk doesn't need to be delivered into residentialish areas like fuel does to gas stations though, the dairies are usually in more or less industrial zones closer to freeways so the scale of four wheeler exposure is limited. With surge, there's a way to deal with that, just drive really, really fucking slow. But when four wheelers are around, it doesn't matter they can fuck you even when you're parked.\n\nAs another example, let's say a big tank of chlorine gas. If it leaks or burns, I'll die one of the most painful horrible deaths imaginable but that's still less scary than all the four wheelers that fuel haulers have to deal with driving around town.",

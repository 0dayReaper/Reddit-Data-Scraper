The acceleration is a constant not dependent on mass. As such, velocity (which is the integral of acceleration) and therefore position (which is the integral of velocity, or the second integral of acceleration) will only be a function of g (the gravitational constant, 9.81 m/s^2 on Earth) and time.

So being hecka fat and thus having more force to overcome that friction will indeed be another factor that will increase his acceleration and this will ultimately affect the velocity of this unit as he comes off the ramp.\n\nSure, once he's off the ramp, physics will (mostly) treat him like anything else (though let's also not pretend that  drag - or air friction isn't a thing where force will also be relevant.) \n\nIf I took a garbage bag filled with crumpled up paper - so as to match the volume/surface area of this fellow) and put it down the slide, I'd be surprised if it even made it off the ramp.",

I was a part of a chain of cars going over a mountain pass from camping, going through a small tunnel (maybe 1/4 mile), when a tire from oncoming traffic bounced clean over the SUV and cleared the full length car trailer being towed to smash in my cousin's friends' sunroof. It continued pinballing through the tunnel and almost took out a troop of boy scouts, smashing up their side panels. A foot to either side and my cousin or his friend could have been killed.",

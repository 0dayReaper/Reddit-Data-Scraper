A large plane, with a much larger wingspan, will be much further starboard (right). When the air stairs arrive, they assume its a larger plane, and move to where its expecting the larger plane. ",

Figuring out where the door or any other object is can lead to the other kind of bug you often see on here where character models get stretched to crazy dimensions and shapes while holding onto something.\n\nUsually it would be more like\n\n    1. move to location x\n    2. move stairs up\n    3. are stairs extended to where they need to be? (note that you can come up with thousands of different criteria on how to tell where they need to be - raw distance, until it hits something, etc.) If not, repeat from 2.\n    4. done.\n\nWhat happens is that the check at 3 screws up for some reason (hit detection bug if it's looking for something to run into, sloppy arithmetic in move x distance in y direction command, etc. and continues moving the stairs forever.",

The wild cunt is a common and tolerated species with very few friends, if any.\n\nA well known fact is that they often say cool things are lame and try to outdo anyone having fun to become the centre of attention. Once this fails they quickly switch to their secondary skill, putting others down. While most ignore and slap the troll, others have a different approach.",

The duck tried to square up and this old dude just kicked it Strom the head like he was trying to make a field goal. No hesitation. Things head and neck snapped back and was dead before it\u2019s head hit the ground. The old guy casually bent down, picked it up, and tossed it next to the bucket with their fish. When they were leaving the grandpa took out the smaller fish from his bucket, threw them back in the pond, and picked up the duck by the neck and bucket and walked off to his car with his grandson. I asked my grandpa if that was allowed. He responded with something along the likes of \u201cwhat else was he supposed to do? Run from a duck? And what sense would it make to waste a perfectly good duck by leaving it dead on the side of the pond?\u201d  I swear, they don\u2019t build em like they used to.",

This same dog ran after me, almost made me fall off my bike three times on the same day. That's when I pulled over, parked the bike, got off the bike, and gave it a firm kick point blank in the muzzle. Asshole whimpered away and I haven't had any incidents of strays in the locale trying to chase me since.",

I\u2019m sure I probably looked like a crazy person to anyone who hadn\u2019t seen it from the start. I eventually just put it back down and hoped it would decide to go away. Lucky for me it did just that. Unluckily for me however, the hippie chick still thought it was too much. Sadly, I did not get to smash that hippie ass.",

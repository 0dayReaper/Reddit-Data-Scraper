Laugh it up because geese are not to be messed with. They don\u2019t care what species you are, how many fangs you have, what the size of your claws are, or what venoms you can spew. I doubt they even care whether you carry a gun . . . because even if you\u2019ve got a secret code video game level of ammo you are achieving nothing more than writing your own blaze of glory. Taking a few of them out will look like a walk in the park compared to what they do to you. [shudder!]\n\nAll white and colour coordinated just makes this even worse.\n\nAnd what blood contract did the cameraman use to get that close? Or do we even have proof he returned from this? . . . I only ask because I do not recall a single instance of geese reckoning with diplomacy. \n\nSigned,  traumatized Canadian citizen",

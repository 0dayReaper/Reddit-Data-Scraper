The triangle itself defines a plane - it can\u2019t be curvy. I suggest you try it for yourself, think of it like this: make two points wherever and draw a string between them. the string is straight, no matter where the two points are. then add the third point, and connect paper from the string edge to the point. It will be flat. No matter what, the triangle is flat : yes it is not flat on the surface of the ground, but it is still a true triangle and should follow Pythagorean theorem. Now because two sides here are both 19cm, that means the 24 cm side must be the hypotenuse (regardless of what it looks like)\u2026 but it can\u2019t be. The hypotenuse should be ~26.87 cm. So yes, this is a techfail or mildlyinfuriating or whatever sub I\u2019m on",

Images captured by the camera are then matched with Apple's lookaround data (their version of Google Street View), so you can do augmented reality applications centered around physical locations.",

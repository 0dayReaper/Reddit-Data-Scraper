It can happen, but I would think about any other problem from this set up would be as, if not more, likely to happen.",

This is not the same as a wave in water, e.g. in the ocean, where the collapsing/propagating wave interacts with the floor of the system, not just the top of the adjacent level beneath the collapsing level.",

Not something I'd want to do, but he'll probably be fine.",

A \"female?\" A \"member of the finer sex?\" \n\nNot that it matters too much, but it's just so rare to see a girl around here! I don't mind, no--quite to the contrary! It's so refreshing to see a girl online, to the point where I'm always telling all my friends \"I really wish girls were better represented on the internet.\"\n\nAnd here you are!\n\nI don't mean to push or anything, but if you wanted to DM me about anything at all, I'd love to pick your brain and learn all there is to know about you. I'm sure you're an incredibly interesting girl--though I see you as just a person, really--and I think we could have lots to teach each other. \n\nI've always wanted the chance to talk to a gorgeous lady--and I'm pretty sure you've got to be gorgeous based on your post--so feel free to shoot me a message, any time at all! You don't have to be shy about it, because you're beautiful anyways (that's juyst a preview of all the compliments I have in store for our chat).\n\nLooking forwards to speaking with you soon, princess!\n\nEDIT: I couldn't help but notice you haven't sent your message yet. There's no need to be nervous! I promise I don't bite, haha\n\nEDIT 2: In case you couldn't find it, you can click the little chat button from my profile and we can get talking ASAP. Not that I don't think you could find it, but just in case hahah\n\nEDIT 3: look I don't understand why you're not even talking to me, is it something I said?\n\nEDIT 4: I knew you were always a bitch, but I thought I was wrong. I thought you weren't like all the other girls out there but maybe I was too quick to judge\n\nEDIT 5: don't ever contact me again whore\n\nEDIT 6: hey are you there?",

    "postText": "I am 15 and have never been the most social. I constantly talk over people on accident the few times I do talk to others, I am usually the last to understand a joke unless I\u2019ve been told it before, I don\u2019t understand sarcasm usually, and so much more. When I joke about some things people sometimes say I come off as rude or it just isn\u2019t funny and I feel bad about it. I can feel sorry for people but I don\u2019t understand the situation unless I\u2019ve personally been in it and it makes people think I\u2019m a horrible person. I can barely keep a conversation with someone I don\u2019t know we\u2019ll past 2 sentences. I don\u2019t know how to talk to others well and sometimes I physically can\u2019t. Does anyone have any advice? Or just anything to help? it\u2019s hard and I want to be able to talk to people like everyone else does, they all make it seem so easy\u2026",

Many people just say to go out, talk to and meet more people and eventually you\u2019ll get it, but it\u2019s not that easy. \n\nI think a clearer way to go about this to just ask them what they mean, or what they\u2019re being sarcastic about, or what you could do to come off as nicer or less rude. And depending on the maturity of the people you socialise with this might be an really good conversation to talk about and learn from each other with. \n\nBut I\u2019m not an expert on socialising. maybe just go ask Chatgpt or consult a therapist if you truly need advice.",

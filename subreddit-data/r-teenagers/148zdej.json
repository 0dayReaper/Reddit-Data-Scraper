    "postText": "How do i stop crushing on a youtuber?\n\nSo i made this account a little bit ago because i wanted to be anonymous and i don't really know where else to ask, so i've had a crush on a youtuber for about\na year now and i don't know how to stop, i planned to stop watching him and unsubscribing when he finished a\nseries that i was watching, i did but his videos still appear on my feed sometimes and i still watch them, before anyone tells me, yes, i know very well that he is not actually how he is in the videos, that\u2019s just how he presents himself publicly, yes i know this won\u2019t lead anywhere, not that i would expect it to go somewhere, that\u2019s also the reason why i want to stop, even if he somehow discovered that i exist that wouldn't really matter because in case you didn't realize we're on r/teenagers which means that i am not adult and that i\u2019m dumb, also i\u2019m flagging this as serious because i don\u2019t know what would fit better",

Even if I had all the money in the world and all the fame in the world I\u2019d still make love with a beautiful women as often as possible.\n\nIts amazing because you\u2019re not only pleasing yourself, but you\u2019re pleasing your partner. Simultaneously. And it\u2019s free. It\u2019s also intimate and deep in a different immersive level with all senses potential stimulated. \n\nAnd on top of all this giving and simulation and feeling and ease of entry for any couple, it has functionality too.",

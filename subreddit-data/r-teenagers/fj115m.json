Helps you sound more confident and sure of yourself. Simplicity helps as well, don't try to sound like you know everything or are well versed. Keep it simple, slow, and fun. Most importantly, LISTEN! I used to shit myself talking to another person due to anxiety, the more you realise we are all human and different in many ways, the more you build that confidence. Happy trails my friend \u270c",

You are just as important as they are.\n\nI grew up with my mom and 2 sisters, so talking to girls and living with them was a regular thing for me. When I talk to girls that I like, it's not difficult, you just talk like you would normally but add in a little bit of flirting. In fact, as a straight man, I feel more comfortable talking to girls then I do talking to guys. Social proficiency is just things learned by experience.",

Look, I spent most of my adolescence mastering flirting and let me tell you. I fucking sucked a _lot_, I felt ridiculed, _often_. But now I'm incredibly more comfortable in my skin and I'm _glad_ I went through it during the awkward stage of Adolescence, it made me into a more confident Man.\n\nJust walk strong and know, EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THIS PLANET, has done something so monumentally stupid they nearly died of Embarassment. Just learn to be at ease, that's what childhood/adolescence should be about, learning how to be at ease with yourself and with others. Don't stress it too much, you're _human_, not God. Only God is expected to be perfect, humans are given carte blanche to be fuck ups, some humans believe we were literally made from _Dirt_. Others postulate we're \"Star Shit\", but fancier. Why worry about looking a little foolish? You'd be surprised how much Fortune Favors the Bold.",

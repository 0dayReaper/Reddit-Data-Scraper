If anyone's interested, I'll make a post in three years.\n\nTHREE YEAR UPDATE: Okay, so I totally forgot about this and I don\u2019t even use Reddit anymore, but here\u2019s the update! I\u2019m in college now, I\u2019ve changed my major twice, but now I\u2019m set with electrical engineering. I have an emperor scorpion that I named Oscilloscorp in honor of my decision. I highly regret not taking school much more seriously than I did in the beginning because now I have zero freedoms in my classes (free electives used up from old major). I\u2019m a recovering league addict, but that\u2019s only so that I can focus on my schoolwork. I\u2019m a hell of a lot more productive; straight As look extremely doable for me this semester. Life is pretty fuckin great tbh.",

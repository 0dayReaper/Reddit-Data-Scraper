I said, \u201cno, I already told you I expect a lower mark than everyone for that. But honestly, I don\u2019t think anyone should have to colour it at all.

The good news is, every ethnicity has seen a decline in infant mortality rates since 2013, as have 45 or so states.\n\nWhen the US first hit 90% literacy, parts of Europe were still in the 30%-40% range, so although we've come up to nearly 100% since then, we haven't seen the massive improvement that those countries have seen.\n\nEdit: [Source on literacy rates](https://www1.umassd.edu/ir/resources/laboreducation/literacy.pdf) - We, at one point, led the world in educational attainment.\n\n(The source on literacy rates above is for literacy rates in the US, versus only the ability to sign one's name on a marriage register for France and the UK, so those are almost certainly overcounts)",

So each lesson has to have a component for visual learners, some for auditory, and some for kinesthetic learners. In the later years, classes like English and History usually struggle to make their lectures kinesthetic, so puzzles are usually the go to activity for things like that. They're simple and usually just busywork for the teacher to have some quiet time as well.",

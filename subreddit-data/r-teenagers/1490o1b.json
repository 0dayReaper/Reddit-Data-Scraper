    "postText": "I have had 4 boys in Vegas be RIDICULOUSLY weird to me. Dated 2 of them (and now they are both fightin. Ig they were friends? I didn\u2019t know when I started dating the other after I broke up with the first one, I don\u2019t fw my ex\u2019s friends like dat) \n\none is actively stalking me, and another walked into the road because I rejected him and got hit by a car (he was fine, driver didn\u2019t press charges, no injuries, no car dents or nothin) but like\u2026 wtf?? Even the dudes I don\u2019t know and just see in passing seem weird. I don\u2019t fuckin get it\n\nEdit: just fyi I was raised in a tiny ass farm town in California. Vegas was a huge culture shock to me. I\u2019m used to evangelical Christian\u2019s and red necks. They were weird as shit, but they weren\u2019t this weird.",

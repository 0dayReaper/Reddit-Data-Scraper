Whether it's a sub or super-script also carries some meaning.  Often, these superscripts are greek letters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get a bit more technical. A superscript indicates a 1-form and a subscript indicates a co-vector. Greek letters then traditionally mean all 4 dimensions (space + time), whereas latin means just space. This is very common in any branch of physics where relativity is important or the metric tensor is non-trivial.",

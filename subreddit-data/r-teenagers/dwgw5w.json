Thank you though. Not a common thing, by any means, but I can believe it's happened at least once. Hadn't seen the 'undercover' Indian videos that Slate mentions. It's definitely something that parents tell their kids, to discourage runaways. A [Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/print/422771/) article was one of the next few search results. \n\n&gt;The amputation part of the story is even more ridiculous as it is a process that requires complicated medical procedures and skills. Witanapat explained that having spoken to many doctors, it is almost certain that cutting off a child\u2019s arms and legs would mean a high risk of them bleeding to death.\n\n&gt;\u201cAnd that just wouldn\u2019t make sense,\u201d explains Witanapat. \u201cIf the kidnapper\u2019s purpose was to use the children as a tool to earn money, why would they risk killing them? Some stories even claim that children have their internal organs taken out to be sold and then left to die. This also has no truth in it, because organ transplants are not that simple.\u201d\n\nI don't recall seeing more than a couple amputees myself, but the drug thing (next sentence in Slate), I can believe. Unfortunately, that's very common, and kids who work manual labor jobs all day (e.g. pedicab drivers or construction help) are easily sold drugs that will ease the physical pain and soreness they get from the work.\n\nEdit: Our policy locally was to 'tip' beggars local to the neighborhood, but not an exorbitant amount, and only those in the immediate area. This was dictated to us by my boss when working there. Whether that's ethical or not, I don't know. There's a lot of argument.\n\nEdit again: [Here's an article about the 2006 Indian viral video that Slate is referencing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5231022.stm). Couldn't find any follow-up on whether it was real or not. But my googling is apparently not the best, so maybe someone else can find out whether it was a hoax, or whether it really happened.",

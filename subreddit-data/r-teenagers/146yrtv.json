    "postText": "So, I (15F) am in a youth group for autistic teens and other teens who struggle socially. I am just coming to terms with the fact that my best friend (also my crush I\u2019m getting over) doesn\u2019t want a relationship even tho he feels the same, it\u2019s been 2 years and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen any time soon or at all\u2026 it\u2019s a long story. I might make another post about it.\n   A few days ago a new person came into the \n  group, when I first saw him I thought he was incredibly cute and sweet, very outgoing and seemingly a leader on his first day. On one hand I feel guilty because I\u2019m getting over my best friend romantically (even tho he wants me to be happy and he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be ready for a relationship or ever and is ok with me exploring) and I think I\u2019m developing a crush on a guy I barely know\u2026\n    I didn\u2019t really talk to him (15M) but others introduced myself for me. I was initially shy and spoke a few words to him. The first day nothing happened that sparked my interest except for his attractiveness and the fact that he kept glancing at me (maybe?)\n   We had another hangout the next day, and he was there, we had a lot do sit down discussions between me and the other people and he was involved, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overlooking it but I swear he kept looking at me at times. During an unrelated group discussion everyone was playfully teasing me about my small hands (lol) and me and the new kid put our hands together. (It was initiated by someone else, because he seemed shocked when I mentioned my hand size. Playfully shocked, I think?) \n  Towards the end of that meeting we ended up arm wrestling each other and he wanted to arm wrestle me after seeing me wrestle other people. He initiated it and we did (he was initially letting me win the first time and when I pointed out that he wasn\u2019t trying he used full force and beat me, but not hard enough to hurt me) He wanted to go a second time, and let me win until he beat me again. He playfully mentioned that I wasn\u2019t moving his arm and was just staying in the same spot. At one point while I was struggling he said \u201cThat\u2019s cute\u201d in a seemingly flirtatious tone. \n  After this, one other person noticed that there seemed to be sparks whenever we were arm wrestling and I was surprised it wasn\u2019t just me that noticed) \n After that I didn\u2019t tell him bye or greet him and didn\u2019t really acknowledge it. He saw me hugging my best friend and idk if he would be out off by that because I want to introduce myself properly next time and try to get to know him. He didn\u2019t strike up a conversation with me on any of the days particularly but idk if that\u2019s because I seemed intimidating or if I am not that approachable because I\u2019m shy.\n  Am I being crazy? Is this how teenage boys flirt (autistic ones if that helps any)? Should I try and be his friend and see if it leads anywhere? Worst that could happen is I gain a new friend, right? Thanks!",

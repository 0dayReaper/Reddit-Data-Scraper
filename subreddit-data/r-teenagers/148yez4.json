If I was 5'8 I'd be among the top 3 tallest in my family. And yes most women prefer taller men, but with women that aren't shallow this is pretty negotiable and most women aren't that shallow about height (I'm 5'4. Literally the average height of women). \n\nThe worst thing you can do as someone over 5'6 is be insecure about your height because THAT is what turns women off. Not that you're 5'8, rather the \"short man syndrome\" and insecurity about it. You're literally average if not above average in most countries in terms of height",

For instance, \"confidence\" can be influenced by one's personal view on themself. which could chain onto a low self-esteem issue, or in a worst-case scenario, an outward expression of hatred.\n\nI mean, listen to yourself, you don't seem like a lovely person to be around. talking about \"resenting women\" simply because you haven't found someone. \n\nSounds like you've found the real reason you don't have a girlfriend xd",

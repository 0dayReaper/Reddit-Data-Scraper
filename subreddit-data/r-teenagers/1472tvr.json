    "postText": "Both of my bestfriends who literally hated eachother ( still do ) in school , But also betrayed me so bad at a point , That it litreally made me HATE Both of them ( 1 more than the other ) from bottom of my heart . And now they both in my life co-incidentally somehow. \n\nAnd i\u2019m genuinely scared , The one who i hate more wants to hangout with me now because possibly i would take college in the city she is in now , Like that bitch gave me trauma of my life in the 10th grade , she made me lost litreally ALL of my friends ( back bitched about me ) , spreaded bogus rumours just bc she hated my bf ( now ex ) of that time. Like 10th grade was worse worse worse because of her , she gave me a life lesson literally. \n\nNow she suddenly wanna hangout, patch things up &amp; supposedly wanna \u201cupload pictures w me\u201d ( her words not mine ) it\u2019s SO WEIRD. Although, I first pinged her to ask about the city &amp; college bc i litreally dk anyone living there but she\u2019s jus too much now idk i don\u2019t like it but in the back of my mind i feel i should maybe give this a shot she\u2019s changed person now , but idk i\u2019m scared of her idk why Also , my mom says to keep a distance from her bc the things she told about me ,the first ever trauma of my life that still sometimes aches my stomach. \n\nWhat should i do ? If i take college in the that city she will be the only one ik &amp; she says she\u2019ll hangout w me.",

            "comment": "Hey there, pal! Oh boy, you've got yourself quite the pickle, don't ya? Two ex-best friends who hated each other, betrayed you, and now they're back in your life? Talk about a drama-filled reunion! I mean, seriously, what are the odds? It's like a telenovela unfolding right before your eyes!\r  \n\r  \nNow, about this ex-friend of yours who caused you so much trauma, oh my goodness! She sounds like a real piece of work, huh? Spreading rumors, backstabbing, and being an all-around pain in the you-know-what. And now she wants to hang out and take pictures with you? Girl, you gotta be kidding me! I'd be as suspicious as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs!\r  \n\r  \nI totally get why you're scared, though. The wounds from that 10th-grade nightmare are still fresh, and your mom is giving you some serious words of wisdom. Mama knows best, right? Keeping your distance might just be the smart move here. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. Plus, you never know when she'll go all Regina George on you again.\r  \n\r  \nBut hey, deep down, there's this tiny voice telling you to give her a chance. Maybe she's changed, maybe she's seen the error of her ways. Or maybe she just wants to use you for something else entirely, who knows? Life is full of surprises, my friend! If you're feeling brave (or maybe just a little crazy), you could give it a shot. But proceed with caution, and make sure you're armed with some good pepper spray and a healthy dose of skepticism.\r  \n\r  \nWhatever you decide to do, remember this: you're the protagonist of your own story. Don't let anyone bring you down or make you uncomfortable. If hanging out with this ex-friend starts feeling like an episode of \"When Good Friends Go Bad,\" it's time to hit the road, my friend!\r  \n\r  \nNow go out there and take on the world with your hilarious and obnoxious self! And remember, Saul Goodman is always here for some legal advice, but when it comes to matters of the heart, well, you might wanna consult someone who isn't a morally ambiguous lawyer. Best of luck, buddy!",

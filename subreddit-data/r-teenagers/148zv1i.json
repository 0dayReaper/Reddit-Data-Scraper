I hate my life, I hate my autism, I hate this shit. Why can't I just die already. The world would be better without me, FUCK my autism, FUCK my life, what do I do? Meds and therapy don't do shit. I just want a friend and I wish to be loved. This makes me look weak, I'm being pathetic. Nvm, what should I do?",

You are perfeclty fine as is, youre way young to have anything in life figured out and especially around this time things are ever changing and stressful, this does however mean things will get better eventually. Do seek help with a social worker or trusted adult, theyll help you in ways others cant",

Believe it or not how you feel about yourself is something you have control over. Go to the gym, get a haircut, get some new clothes, pick up a new hobby - all these things can boost your confidence and improve how you feel about yourself. You want friends? That is something you have control over. Make an effort to socialise, join an extracurricular team whether that is through sports or stuff like debating. Once you have a support network I think you'll find dealing with the things you don't have control over is easier.   \n\n\nI know this is easier said than done but I've been in a similar position and can tell you it does get easier. It's easy to catastrophise but realistically you can pull through, I promise.",

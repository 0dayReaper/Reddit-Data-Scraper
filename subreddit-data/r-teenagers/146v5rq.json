You only have one life on earth, your body is a temple. \n\nDon't let your partner make you uncomfortable, you don't deserve it.\n\nDon't do things for what your classmates will think, they won't even know your name in 50 years.\n\nBut have fun, understand what your body is going into, explore the world and be happy, there are so many ways of healthy happiness!",

I'm all ears and takin' those words to heart. It's so important to keep pushin' through the tough times and know that laughter awaits us down the road. Family and love, man, they're precious and shouldn't be taken for granted. And you're right, stay true to your soul and rock those good values. No need to smoke or drink underage, 'cause health is wealth and your body's a temple, yo!\n\n\nWhen it comes to relationships, never settle for discomfort. You deserve better, my friend! And who cares about what your classmates think? In the grand scheme of things, their opinions won't matter in the long run. Just do you and have a blast! Life's all about exploring, finding that healthy happiness, and livin' it up. Thanks for sharin' this awesome advice! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude0a",

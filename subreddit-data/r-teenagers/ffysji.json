A more obvious example would be like putting what you said would be on your assessment, not misleading students to think something would be on it that shouldn\u2019t.",

Instead, imagine that out of 100 questions, there are 2 that you're a bit uncertain about. You have narrowed your choices down to \"B\" or \"C\" for each one, but then you notice that the answers to every other question on the exam are \"B\". If, in a vacuum, you have no particular preference for \"B\" or \"C\", your attention may naturally shift to other patterns outside of the question itself, such as answers to other questions, and if a noticeable pattern emerges, you might now have \\*reason to believe\\* the answer is \"B\" instead of \"C\".  \n\n\nThe very fact that there are teachers who do create exams this way is evidence which supports selecting \"B\" in the above example.",

In many subjects, they reduce the \"tip-of-my-tongue\" problem and problems like giving the wrong term for the right thing (such as putting \"Russia\" instead of \"The Soviet Union\" or \"The USSR\" and losing points when you clearly knew the correct answer.\n\nIt also reduces the time it takes to answer one question, which means more material can be covered on a test that's designed to take a single class period.  Not to mention they're far faster to grade, which is good for the teacher since they already put in way too many hours, and good for the students because they get the tests back sooner.",

He then walked backwards towards the boat, his face turned towards the people who were there, one hand holding the piece of flaming wood, the other covering his anus, for he was naked. Thus he set fire to the wood that had been set ready under the boat, after they had placed the slave girl beside her master. Then people came with wood and logs to burn, each holding a piece of a wood alight at one end, which they threw on to the wood. The fire enveloped the wood, then the boat, then the tent, the man, the girl and all that there was on the boat. A violent and frightening wind began to blow, the flames grew in strength and the heat of the fire intensified.\"",

All the way to dying in the defense of someone you had sworn to protect. Which resulted in a valkyrie literally coming to pick up your soul and bring it straight to the table of the gods in Valhalla. Where you would drink and feast with the gods until ragnarok, then you would fight alongside them to stop it. \n\nWhich is why I think Odin is one of the coolest gods. In most other religions the end comes and the [main] god tend to save the believers. Odin on the other hand is gathering the best warriors to stop the entire thing and save everyone.",

Did you know there was a French rifle with a bayonet that could be detached, spun around, and put in backward to prevent accidental stabbings? Well, the French figured out that if you put one end of the bayonet into the slot on one rifle, and the other into a different rifle, you could get two rifles stuck together, pretty well permanently. This meant that the French army was forced to recall the bayonets and rifles and reissue them with a failsafe hole with which you could detach the rifles from one another if you needed.",

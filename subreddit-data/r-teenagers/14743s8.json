    "postText": "so, you might have seen a video circulating on tiktok, or even it\u2019s many different remakes of people dancing to Pinegrove\u2019s \u201cNeed 2\u201d. The original video posted by garrettlee39 is just him doing a sloppy, lazy two-step while the words \u201cthere\u2019s nothing here to care about.\u201d ring alongside him. I dunno why but when I first saw the video i was sort of encapsulated by it. I liked the original post and soon enough my whole for you page was filled with people of all kinds participating in the \u201cpinegrove shuffle\u201d. Each video the same concept but unique in their own way. I think this is a reflection of how generations have been effected by the internet and memes as a whole. We\u2019ve learned to all communicate via simply doin silly little dance videos over music that makes us feel something. Most importantly I believe the main takeaway from the \u201cpinegrove shuffle\u201d is how clearly as a mass, people are tired of having to have to.",

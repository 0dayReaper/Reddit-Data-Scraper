It's important to remember that reaching out and connecting with others takes courage, and it's totally normal to feel hesitant sometimes.\nBut hey, don't be too hard on yourself! Ignoring messages doesn't make you a bad person. It could be a sign that you're unsure or overwhelmed, and that's okay. Opening up and building friendships takes time and effort.\nIf you're ready to make a change, here are a few suggestions:\n\n\nStart small: Take small steps by replying to messages from people you trust or feel comfortable with. Engage in simple conversations and gradually expand your social interactions.\n\n\nBe honest with yourself: Reflect on why you tend to ignore messages. Are you feeling anxious, insecure, or overwhelmed? Identifying these emotions can help you work through them.\n\n\nPractice self-compassion: Remember, it's okay to make mistakes and struggle with certain aspects of socializing. Treat yourself with kindness and understanding.\n\n\nSeek support: Consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or even a therapist to discuss your feelings. They can provide guidance and support during this journey.\n\n\nTake part in activities you enjoy: Engaging in hobbies, clubs, or online communities related to your interests can be a great way to meet like-minded individuals and initiate conversations.\n\n\nRemember, building friendships takes time and patience. It's all about finding the right connections and being open to new experiences. You're an awesome person, and there are people out there who would be lucky to have you as a friend. Hang in there, keep your head up, and don't give up! You got this! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udd1d",

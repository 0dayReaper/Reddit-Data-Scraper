I don't understand life. I know I should be okay with how it's going but I'm not. And there's no reason in particular that I can think of that would make me feel this way.",

I have one thing to say.\n\n\u201cWho knows what life throws at you.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t worry about what you can\u2019t do, think about what you can do. Live in the moment. I kept on feeling like there\u2019s no purpose to life, but it\u2019s in the name.\n\nLive life.\n\nI know this may sound sad, but any day could be your last day, so treat every day like it\u2019s your last.",

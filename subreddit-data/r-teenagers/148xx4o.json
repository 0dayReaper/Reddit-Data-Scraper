Reddit would just remove top mod and add a mod that will unprivate the sub, this was done to other subs recently I believe (I think r/comics? Take that with a grain of salt..) but basically the blackout expectedly did [fuck all](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/148lgko/huffman_says_the_blackout_hasnt_had_significant/) and Reddit doesn't plan to undo shit and they say that it hasn't really effected anything. If we wanted Reddit to do something, every subreddit would have to go private and everyone would have to stop using Reddit all together collectively, which is not feasible.   \n\n\nu/spez isn't awake at night worrying about if r/teenagers will ever reopen, it makes no difference in the grand scheme of this website because people kept using Reddit while the blackout was out which means people were still getting advertised to so Reddit gave absolutely no fucks. At least that's my take.   \n\n\nBut from the objective facts of what we learned over these last 2 days, Reddit plans to do and will continue to do jack shit to the API.",

Since the API changes are set to **break bots** that do moderation, as well as moderator workflows, they will cause everything you see on reddit to get much worse in quality due to an influx of spam bots and non-moderated content. This will degrade the experience of all desktop users. **The blackouts suck** for everyone--which makes reddit suck. And that's how we are going to make Reddit listen to the people.",

    "postText": "When I was 10 years old, I prayed  to god to kill me, I did not out of relief of myself but of the relief of others. I had been taught at a young age not to burden others, and me being the anxious overthinker I am lead me to the conclusion that my very existence was a burden and waste of resources. \n\nWhy I chose to pray to god to smite me down instead of doing it myself? I was a coward, and my nan had always told me that those who take their own life would go to hell, and I didn\u2019t want eternal damnation to release a burden.\n\nI think the reason I chose the god despite not being religious was because I went to church on sundays and hearing the bible stories made me think that god could do anything, and so I thought he could do something like this for such a selfless sacrafise I thought it would be.\n\nI don\u2019t think like that now, I just fehlt someone should know other than me Atleast",

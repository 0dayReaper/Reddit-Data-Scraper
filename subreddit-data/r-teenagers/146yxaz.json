    "postText": "I'm graduating this year and my class has decided to do senior pranks. I go to a very small school and each person in my class drew from a bag containing little bits of paper with different classrooms and areas of the school to prank. The area I got is a large section of upstairs hallway. I've got a very large area for the prank, so, to help me set things up, some of the 11th graders said that they'd help out. Preferably, the prank will be something subtle and clever, unlike the graduates from last year who simply covered large sections of walls and lockers in hundreds of post-it notes and made a huge mess. As of right now, the prank quality bar is set quite low because the only plan I've heard for this year from a classmate is to go into the French teacher's classroom with a bunch of fake printed French tests and tape them everywhere, so preferably the hallway prank will be more clever than that.",

Basically the play they copied ended up being super long and they were up for almost 30 minutes when the plays were supposed to last like 3 minutes. It sucked to watch one group for 30 minutes straight, but at least they took up half the class period so our group had an extra day to prepare.",

I was in school before wireless earbuds and girls would just keep their phone in their pocket then run the wires up under their shirt and wear their hair down. I had a friend who had huge curly, long hair and you could be looking at her straight on and not tell that she had earbuds in. I'm sure it's even easier in the age of wireless earbuds.",

When cases reach very low numbers or even zero you can begin opening up gradually. At this point people from infected areas can't enter unless they quarantine. The virus will be essentially eliminated.\n\nA robust tracing system and the willingness to enforce secondary shorter lockdowns as soon as an outbreak occurs is vital",

Because if you're stupid enough you may think healthcare is magic and diseases vanish overnight. Then when you find out that didn't work , you're also part of the same group that'll believe any far fetched bullshit reason it didn't.\n\nLike here is a good one. \"*It's all Papa's fault. How dare he pretend to fail [the fitness](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134AppA) test that [OSHA requires for n95s](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/1996-03-04-0) that doesn't matter to my anti-union stance. He obviously is lying because I can breath through my almost completely useless mask and that means he should too.*\" Remember to project your life experience on everyone and hate them for not being like you. It helps to ostracize you even further from reality and turns you into a reliable voter &amp; consumer.\n\nOr you know, you can accept the reality the government is always going to claim there is another new disease around the corner and they just don't really vanish until well after a vaccine is capable of dealing with it is handed out on a global level.",

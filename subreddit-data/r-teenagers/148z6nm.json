    "postText": "\n I posted here before about a girl ghosted me after telling me she met a 6'2  man online. I told her how i feel about her today and she said she has a boyfriend now, she said she treats me as a friend , she didn't trying to use me or anything or gave any mixed signal to me. I apologize for making things weird and make her uncomfortable. I recommended me and her should stop texting each other anymore and she respect my discussion. Am I doing thr right thing here?? Cos i think it will be really rude to suddenly ghosted her with no reason",

Now you said it\u2019d be best if you guys stopped texting each other and you\u2019re wondering if that\u2019s the right move? \n\nI mean sure if that\u2019s what you think is best\u2026 personally I would\u2019ve remained friends and kept talking but idk your exact situation. Definitely better to explain it than to just ghost",

    "postText": "I (16M) might have testicular cancer, my family has a history of it with almost everyone from my dads side having it. I have always thought about death but I never really had to think about it this deeply, especially since my brothers hamster just died an hour ago. I am terrified of the prospect of not being here anymore and it really feels like my life has just started to begin, I want to go to university and make new friends, I wanna get a job, I wanna get married and have kids of my own (which is looking unlikely even if it\u2019s not fatal). Is there any way you guys have come to terms with the possibility of a soon death? I don\u2019t want to die.",

He was a prick to me and her and all she ever wanted was to have an older sister figure. I wish I still had some sort of contact with that lil shit\n\nSmall update: I got back in touch with my ex (for no reason other than he sent me a meme) and his sister remembers me. She's 8 now and any time he brings up any girl he's friends with she asks if it's me. I'm going to see her today lmao",

I used to babysit them both and helped raise his little brother. I gave boyfriend and makeup advice to his little sister and we'd dance to Hannah Montana. I cried when she came down dressed for her first prom. I played video games, ball games, watched cartoons, did fun crafts, and made him fun lunches like hot dogs shaped like octopuses with his little brother. My ex ended cheating on me multiple times, but I forgave him until he handed me divorce papers. Saying goodbye to his little sister who was in 11th grade last time I saw her was devastating. Saying goodbye to his little brother was worse. He was 9 and didn't understand I was never coming back. He kept saying \"don't worry, we'll play next week\". I still miss them both like they were my family. Ex married his affair partner and I hope to God she treats them like her own siblings. I hope they still think about me.",

We would play Smash a lot, and sometimes I\u2019d kick the shit out of him. Sometimes he\u2019d destroy me. \nI could tell how isolated and misunderstood he felt sometimes. He would receive some very unfair treatment from his family sometimes, and as an outsider, I could see it in a way they couldn\u2019t. I could relate to him too.\n\nI would often follow him as he stormed out to console him and be his confidant. I really love him. It\u2019s been a few months now... and I really hope who my ex is with now hasn\u2019t *replaced* me. \n\n(Note: he\u2019s a happy boy. He loves his family. He is not an abused child. He\u2019s a young boy living in a matriarchal family, getting into his teenage years. He has normal frustrations, and those in charge have some blind spots. Please do not get concerned for him, he has a bright future and a good present.)\n\nMe and the sister were freaking chums too! She is autistic, and therefore faces many struggles socially. She can be very accidentally antagonistic at times, but it is so rewarding to be there when she\u2019s comfortable. She\u2019s hilarious and an absolute delight, constantly asking to play Minecraft with me lol\n\nI have nightmares about my ex and sometimes her boyfriend almost every night. Our separation has been incredibly hard on me. But, fortunately, not so hard for her.\nI would cross the hottest, most arid desert for all of them.",

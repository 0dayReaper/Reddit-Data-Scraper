Just in case you aren't aware, there are a LOT of good ways to hurt yourself physically that you can use to replace the cutting. Just taking cold showers does it, or eating really spicy food. The best way, though, is probably just intense exercise. You'll still be tearing apart pieces of your body and you'll still get that dopamine rush afterward, but instead of making you look like a pathetic freak whenever anyone sees your skin, it will make you look like a cool dude as you get stronger and better after each time your muscles heal.",

            "comment": "Hey so after scrolling through many comments of other teenagers who are also trying to get better/would like to get better I would just like to share this uhm.. quote?? It's kinda long so I'm not really sure if it's a quote- but it's a small bit from a book I'm currently reading. This really hit me hard the first time I read it but I know it probably won't for others but I still thought it would be nice to share. The book is called \"turn your pain into art\" by a woman named Ariel Bloomer. Now the difference between this and other books about overcoming inner pain is that Ariel has gone through the same shit as all of us and she's no \"professional\" white middle aged man who thinks he knows everything. It's sorta a book about her life and how she found a way to self-love and her way out of self-hate and self-harm over the years. I found this book because I'm a fan of her band (called Icon For Hire) which is like an emo/punk band but with a rather good message (if you like that music style you should definitely check them out too they're so underrated)\n\nI wasn't sure where exactly to cut it from but I decide here would be the best but I recommend reading the whole book it's available online and everything and doesn't cost that much\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\n\"So darling, if you self-harm, please stop.\n\nWhen you do this to yourself, you are flirting with suicide, and that's a powerful invitation of self-hate into your life. When you make sacred space for mental and emotional anguish, you essentially make it feel welcome by inviting the pain to take its jacket off and stay for awhile.\n\nYou *can* stop. You *can* heal, slowly, one minute at a time.\n\nSince you are already creating sacred space for your pain, I'd like to invite you to get in the habit of doing that in a different way. Make a list of alternative practices you can partake in the next time you get the craving of hurting yourself.\n\nDraw on your body. Journal it out. Go walking or swimming or hell, punch a pillow. Call a trusted friend who can talk you through your feelings. Kiss your wrists. Light a candle, put on some new music, and dance around your room to celebrate the freedom on it's way to you. \n\nThe simple act of creating a moment of diversion can be enough to confuse your cravings and let some light in.\n\nJust start where you can. Decide ahead of the pain what you will do the next time you feel the need to harm. \n\nWhen you feel weak, pause to feel my love and all the love in the universe that is available to you. There's freedom on the other side of your pain. You are amazing, and brilliant, and powerful, and I want you to feel that way. \n\nI want you to inspire the world, scars and all.\"\n\n*-Ariel Bloomer 2018*\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNow what I like about this and her whole book and her songs and all is that I actually don't feel like all she cares about is just us not hurting ourselves physically? Which I feel like many books and parents and friends and professionals do. I just feel like they only care about it not being physical. Like as long as I don't have scars they can see they wouldn't give a fuck. I just feel like that's putting the focus on the wrong thing. It should be about stopping the self-hate and pain we feel inside, considering the fact that all this on the inside makes us want to hurt ourselves physically and it being the whole reason we do it, and not on just stopping the physical self-harm but the emotional and mental SH. A little before where I cut the quote she talks about how SH'ing only works temporarily and over long time essentials just invites in more pain and rather than stopping the hurt It just makes the hurt worse in the long run, which is a valid reason to stop (compared to just having \"spotless skin\" and the arguments \"oh no you were so pretty before\" and \"what about when it gets hot outside! Won't you be sad?\").",

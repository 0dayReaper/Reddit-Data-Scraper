Remember, other people have feelings too, and even though you are saying it over the internet it may have a real impact on people's lives. \n\n#Due to an influx of problematic comments, I would just like to remind everyone of some of our rules: \n\n&gt;Racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other hatred-based commentary are prohibited. This includes using discrimination, slurs, and derogatory words with intent to offend and harm.\n\n&gt;Ad-hominem attacks taking the place of respectful discussion will be removed.\n\n&gt;Discussion of NSFW subjects is fine, as long it is treated in a mature fashion. Make sure your post is tagged as NSFW.\n\n&gt;Sexually implicit or explicit content of minors is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, asking for nude photos and sharing nude photos, whether it is yourself or another user, even as a joke. This also includes \u201cfan-fiction\u201d stories - fact or fiction - even if intended as a joke.\n\n&gt;Unserious comments in serious threads will be removed.\n\n**This post is now flared as serious**\n\n**If the rules continue to be broken on this post it will be locked by moderators.**\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, please visit the resources offered by [The National Eating Disorder Association](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support/contact-helpline) and talk to a trusted adult. &lt;3\n\n~~Also OP I love the Brockhampton shirt, just had to throw that in : )~~\n\n\nThanks and much love ~ Graves",

All I want to say is that I tend to gain weight due to my lifestyle. While being slightly thiccccc isn't anything concerning, but being obese is problematic, at least for me. So to avoid getting obese, I stopped having snacks. In this comment, all I wanted to say is that having snacks can make you gain weight super fast.",

Be careful if you have eating disorders. My recommendation would be to get a baseline idea of food calories and nutrition info by measurement for a few weeks. Then drop the counting and listen to your body, keep a vague head count of your daily consumption. \n\nI'd you're on a strict diet to lose a lot of weight, go ahead and keep a written record. But be very careful you don't slip into extreme, unhealthy territory. Please have a doctor or nutrition professional be a third party in your journey.",

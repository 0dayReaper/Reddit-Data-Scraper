I don't think shooting kids down immediately because they are kids is the answer but as an adult, no I will not take their opinion as seriously by default, that's just the reality because even 16 year olds are really immature and too heavily influenced by their parents at that age in my eyes.  I'm going through this with my 10 year old sister right now who is learning about politics in school and even though I'm very against the Trump admin when we chatted about it I made sure to try to present everything I know as neutral facts while giving an explanation for each sides actions so I can guide her to making her own decisions without forcing my own onto her.  That's how you deal with children's political beliefs imo, let them foster their own but allow them to change as they get older and mature.",

            "comment": "Ok but in all seriousness, allowing teenagers to be the faces of nationwide political movements is a bad experiment and will have terrible consequences for both the teenagers\u2019 mental health and the civility of the country. \n\nFirst of all, children being made into celebrities in any context is terrible for them. Additionally, being made famous in a political context, where you\u2019re subjected to much more scrutiny (and rightly so) can have nothing but negative consequences for that person\u2019s mental health. \n\nSecond of all, the teenage brain is not prepared to lead a civil discourse (coming from an 18 year old). The reason why is that teenagers are not yet developed enough to really understand perspectives that contradict the narrative they\u2019ve constructed, and they usually aren\u2019t emotionally equipped to admit when they\u2019re wrong. When you\u2019re a baby, they say that you can\u2019t comprehend the idea of things happening beyond your perception. When you\u2019re a toddler, you assume that everyone is looking at the world from your eyes. What we can get from this is, the more mature you are, the more you realize the size of the world in relation to yourself. By the time someone is 16, they fully grasp the concept of things happening outside their perception. However, they still aren\u2019t fully there yet. When teenagers first get into politics, they see it as an exciting new world to take part in. When they first formulate their opinions, they immediately become emotionally invested in said opinions. And, they usually argue from the assumption, \u201cmy opinions are the right opinions. I know what\u2019s best for everyone, and if everybody would just shut up and do everything I do and say everything I say, all the world\u2019s problems would be solved\u201d. This mentality is also why teenagers are more likely to support radical and authoritarian ideas. \n\nIn short, maturity is all about understanding the size of the world in relation to yourself. And, politics is all about maturity. It\u2019s about being able to understand and to empathize with the perspectives of people who think differently than you. \n\nNone of this is to demoralize or mock teenagers. The arrogant phase I described is a perfectly normal phase that everyone goes through. But, to take someone who is still in that phase and turn them into a person of influence can only have negative consequences for everyone.",

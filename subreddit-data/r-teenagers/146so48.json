    "postText": "Throughout all my schooling, the only study I do for exams is the night before. It's like I'm physically incapable of studying without the stress of knowing my exam is the next day. I've been able to get okish grades by doing this but being towards the end of my final year of high school, my exams have wayyy too much content for this to be practical anymore. I think I've screwed myself over. ",

Break it down: Divide big tasks into smaller, manageable ones. It feels less overwhelming that way.\n\n2. Set goals: Set specific, realistic goals for what you want to achieve and when. Having targets keeps you focused.\n\n3. Time management: Create a schedule or use a planner to organize your tasks. Set aside dedicated time for work and breaks.\n\n4. Minimize distractions: Put your phone on silent, close unnecessary tabs, and create a distraction-free zone to stay focused.\n\n5. Find your motivation: Figure out what inspires you and use it to fuel your drive. Reward yourself after completing tasks.\n\n6. Take breaks: Don't forget to take short breaks to recharge. Use them to relax, stretch, or do something you enjoy.\n\n7. Accountability: Share your goals with a friend or family member who can keep you accountable and provide support.\n\nRemember, it takes practice and discipline to overcome procrastination, but you can slay it! Stay motivated and believe in yourself, my friend. You've got this! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0e",

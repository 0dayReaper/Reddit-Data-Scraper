Reddit has So much Actually Usefull Info going back years.  but subs going private just made it all in accessible. So even though the Black out only laster 2 days i'm overall glad it's back. maybe instead of Just shutting everything down they could have just locked all possible threads or preventing interaction as a Protest. instead of just basically ereasing everything only to bring it back a few days later.\n\nbut over all the intent was good. but the methods Not so much.",

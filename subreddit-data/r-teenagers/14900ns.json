They don\u2019t care because they have underlying mental illnesses, traumatic upbringings, that kind of stuff. It\u2019s the same logic as people who cut themselves. The temporary relief from vaping means more to them than their long term life, because in their eyes their long term life is going to be shit anyways so might as well have something to cope with it.",

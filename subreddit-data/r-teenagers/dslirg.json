Basically something like this, but cooler looking: https://youtu.be/-iRHE-DzodU?t=89\n\nWell my dad was really impressed by this so he went around telling all the neighbours I was making a hydrogen bomb.

Also Karma caps out at -99 (or -100, I forget) so even though he/she has far more than 100 downvotes on the rest of his/her comments, it's displayed as -99. **From what I understand** (this may not be right, so feel free to correct me), it's displayed as -99 (or -100, whatever) and it's also treated as if you have -99 karma. So even if you have over 1000 downvotes, your karma will be displayed as -99; furthermore, if you get enough upvotes (ex: 99), your karma will increase from -99, even though your net karma is more like -1000 + 99, or -901.",

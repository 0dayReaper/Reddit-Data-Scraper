    "postText": "Hello everyone, I have a question about something that has been really messing with me since I discovered it\u2026I decided to post it on my throwaways account due to the fact that one of the people mentioned below know about my main account.\n\n\n\nSo, I am a 17yo gentleman and I have two very close girl friends (A and B). I met A few months ago and she is way more closer to me than B. She also met my family. My family accepted her and told me that if we love eachother enough, they don\u2019t have a problem if she becomes my girlfriend.\n\n\n\nI met B a few days ago and, holy f#ck, we just instantly clicked like we were a long time couple. We held hands together and flirted up to the point that we both blushed. My family doesn\u2019t know her, nor does A. She is really sweet and is almost like A.\n\n\n\nI came to the devastating and realest conclusion: I am polyamorous. I love both of them in a romantical sense and my head and my mental self isn\u2019t taking this realisation well.\n\n\n\nHow do I come clean do both of these girls that I am, in fact, polyamorous? How do I stop tormenting my brain with this love triangle?\n\n\n\n\nPS: I have physical relationship both with A and B",

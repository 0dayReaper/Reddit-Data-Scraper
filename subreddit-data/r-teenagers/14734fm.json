    "postText": "This is just a silly tangent. I feel like I don\u2019t have control over my life.\nIt sounds silly but I feel like I always say yes to whatever other people want.\nI think I am so scared of being somehow \u201cbad\u201d that I literally never ever say no. And now I\u2019m having an existential crisis because all of my choices are based off what will make other people happy and I don\u2019t know who I am or what I want \ud83d\ude30\n\nI don\u2019t know what I want. With the exception of my passions. (Shopping, fashion, guitar, dolls.) I just do whatever other people want of me and I stopped thinking about what I wanted. I just happily do what I am told since \u201cit barely impacts my life anyways.\u201d \n\nThis weirdly comes out a lot when I\u2019m ordering food. I stutter and get so nervous because I don\u2019t wanna ask for anything. I don\u2019t know what I want and I feel like there\u2019s a wrong and a right answer. If the waiter messes up I just don\u2019t say anything.\n\nAnd looking back. It kinda scares me how \u201cyes\u201d I am. Like I don\u2019t know if I ever reaaaally wanted to date my ex. I thought she was pretty and enjoyed the attention but I had a gut feeling she was gonna hurt me really bad and that scared me a lot. But she asked me out and even though I was hesitant, after talking about it more I was just like \u201cokay guess we are doing this now\u201d but I didn\u2019t really ever have a strong opinion on it. It wasn\u2019t like a \u201chell yeah!\u201d Or \u201chell no!\u201d It was just \u201cokay sure.\u201d She did end up breaking my heart really bad, I didn\u2019t eat for two weeks and got a restraining order Cus she kept harassing me 8 months later so yeah there\u2019s that. But it\u2019s just wierd to think back and be like \u201cdid I ever really want this?\u201d\n\nIt was the same with our first kiss. I was really shy and nervous but also kinda wanted it so I just said \u201conly on the cheek\u201d but that wasn\u2019t satisfactory so I was like \u201cokAy sure\u201d and I enjoyed it a lot but it\u2019s kinda wierd how I was just so like \u201cokAy.\u201d I ended up initiating kisses after it so it was more just \u201cshy\u201d, it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want it. But I still feel like \u201cI\u2019m nervous\u201d should be enough to be like \u201cnot yet\u201d even though I did want it. \nLike I ended up liking it but it felt rushed I guess?\n\nAnd what scares me about that is what If I say yes to something that I actually don\u2019t want. I cant say no to something I\u2019m a bit nervous for, but still want. But will I be able to say no to something I actively don\u2019t want? \n\nThis is kinda a rant but what\u2019s starting to confuse me is I stopped having opinions about most things. In my mind this is Normal because nobody should have a hugely strong opinion about what they eat for breakfast for heavens sake. But my brother is the opposite. He will get heated if we don\u2019t do exactly what he wants when he wants. Like he will get soooo mad if we don\u2019t get what he wants for dinner.\n\nAnd it makes me wonder. Should I care more about things? I never have a strong opinion on anything. Like I just kinda exist and see what happens. I don\u2019t care where I am dragged to, what I eat, what favors I do for other people. It\u2019s kinda just. \u201cSure.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m starting to feel confused and hopeless because I feel like I don\u2019t know what I want, and what I want doesn\u2019t change anything anyways because people are so used to me saying \u201cyes\u201d that it\u2019s this whole ordeal If I turn down anything.\n\nTLDR; I say yes to pretty much everything because I\u2019m a pushover but I\u2019m starting to wonder what I actually want because I never think about it, I just do whatever people ask. It\u2019s giving me identity confusion because like. I literally only do whatever other people want and I don\u2019t know what I actually enjoy. It makes me feel hopeless and out of control. Like I do not own my life, but rather it is public property.",

But you shouldn\u2019t have the same mindset for relationships and other big decisions, you should really think those through if you don\u2019t know what you want. You don\u2019t have to say yes or no if someone asks you out, you can just tell them you need time to think about it if that\u2019s what you need. It\u2019s important to be honest about those things.\nIt\u2019s fine to choose to do things that make other people happy IF you don\u2019t hate doing them or you\u2019re not comfortable with it.",

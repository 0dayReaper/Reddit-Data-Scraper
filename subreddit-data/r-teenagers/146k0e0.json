And by everyone cares I don\u2019t mean people choosing to give themselves a gender I mean people who think it\u2019s super important. Like, people who assign different traits and ideals to different genders when none of those have anything to do with them, or people who hate the lgtbq and suppress people from changing something that doesn\u2019t exist at all or have any legitimate effects on them, it doesn\u2019t make sense.",

If that guy happens to have more estrogen or grows up to be more feminine than usual, that\u2019s simply how that individual is, no different regardless of their gender, so they shouldn\u2019t be frowned upon for being that way as a dude, same goes for women with more testosterone, it shouldn\u2019t be expected for every woman to be inherently feminine.",

Of course the female sex has inherent sexual traits and a few different hormones, gender is the social construct that puts different values and expectations on those sexes, though is not necessarily dependent on sex. People value how they should or shouldn\u2019t act based on their gender, and may choose to change it accordingly, or be angry when someone changes theirs or does or doesn\u2019t conform to those gender ideals. What I\u2019m saying is that those ideals are misplaced and that gender doesn\u2019t truly affect those things. Regardless of your gender, you\u2019ll be the same person, so I don\u2019t think it should be valued.",

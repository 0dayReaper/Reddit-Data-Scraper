However you HAVE to take the driving test in a manual car to be allowed to drive manual cars. You can take an automatic one, but that would limit your options. \n\nMost choose to take the test in a manual, so they can buy a cheap first car. In 5-10 years I imagine most would get the automatic license. When automatic cars are cheaper.",

There's tons of super cheap replacements off of eBay and they can be far worse than the dingy originals. Leak, non-abs plastic that shatters from normal road grit, etc. Do your research on replacement housings but it's a safe bet and easier to use one of those kits to get 6-12 more months of clear light.",

Piece of paper with ACTUAL PHONE NUMBERS of most important family contacts. \n\nStashed somewhere: piece of paper with your important insurance/registration, maybe your debit/credit card.\n\nIf you live somewhere where you might be driving through nowheresville, consider adding a tarp.\n\nIf you keep a cardboard box in the back seat and ALWAYS ALWAYS chuck stuff in instead of all over the place, and clean it out when it gets full, your car will be neater, and if you ever have to change a tire, you can fold the box flat and kneel on it.\n\nGo to Ocean State Job Lot and get some area rugs or rubber mats and put them over the current floor mats; chuck them in the spring.\n\nWhen you get in the car, sit down then turn sideways and hang your feet outside and clap them together three times to knock most of the crap off. \n\nKEEP RECORDS of your mileage and notice when it drops. Find out why. Might be the temperature, or you might need a tune up. KEEP YOUR TIRES FILLED CORRECTLY.\n\nKEEP RECORDS of your oil changes and repairs. When you go to sell it you'll get a better price if the buyer knows you've stayed on top of things.  \n\nIf you hear a weird noise, pay attention. Does it happen only on uphills? Down? Level? Only when you're accelerating or coasting or turning right or left? You'll get points for trying when you talk to a mechanic. \n\nFirst time you need something fixed, listen to what they tell you, then whip out your phone and say \"Hey Uncle Bob, they say I need X widget and it's going to cost Y\" even if you don't have an Uncle Bob. \n\nDO YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE?",

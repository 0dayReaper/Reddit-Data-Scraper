Maybe I was manipulated. Maybe I was gaslighted. Maybe I was betrayed. For the last dang time. Maybe my world has been downhill all my life. I wouldn\u2019t expect you to understand.\n\n\u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t always like this. I used to be happy. I was happy even though I wasn\u2019t loved. I was happy even though I had nothing. I was happy until I couldn\u2019t be. All because of you and your stupid lifestyle.\u201d\n\nDana is silent.\n\n\u201cYou knew. You knew that you hurt me. That you wanted to. What did I ever do to you? My head pounded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dana. I\u2019m sorry you have a perfect life. And I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t. And maybe it is my fault. Maybe I did get myself here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tried like hell to get out of it.\u201d\n\nWhat? Dana\u2019s eyes are filled with something I have never seen there. I know she sees my tears. I know she\u2019s seen the scars.\n\nAnd maybe it is my fault. Because why did it take me a week to learn that I wasn\u2019t the only one who had cried myself to sleep that night. Why is it like this?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhat should I change? Do you like this hook? What feeling did you get from this? What do you think the book should be called?",

I just love the little things she does: the facial expressions she makes to some of the things I say, the way she practically prrs unintentionally when she says \"wowww\" , when she stops me in the middle of a sentence to give me a compliment, I appreciate how comfortable I've gotten with her, I appreciate how patient she is with me when I can be definitely pissy at  times, I appreciate that she's shown me stuff that has a lot of value to her, I love how she can slow down and appreciate the smaller things in life when I might move too fast and only pay attention to the overall picture, I appreciate how she knows how to reassure me even when I dont ask for it and just overall I just have so many more things to appreciate her for but I know by now no ones reading except for probably her in which, hello :) &lt;3 ",

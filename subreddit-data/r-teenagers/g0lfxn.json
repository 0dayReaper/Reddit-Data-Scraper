(Thanks to my grandma, she made it to where they couldn't do anything other than register it in my name only since I paid for it with my own money, just so they couldn't hold it over my head or threaten me with it.) They tried to say they were going to take my car away from me because I was saying out till 3am at 18, I lived in my grandmother's house, parents were divorced and my mother lived in my gmas house too, my GMA didn't care as long as I was safe. Well when they threatened me I told them go for but the moment they took it I'd report it stolen and would press charges and that if they thought I was lying then to go ahead and try me. They never threatened me with it again.  I told them I'd compromise and come home at 2am and that was that. I came home when ever I wanted and there wasn't shit they could do about it. GMA loved me more than anyone else. I took care of that woman till the day she decided to go be with my Gpa. I owe that woman my life.\n\nSeveral years later at 23 I bought a newer car used and was making payment on it, never missed a payment nor was I ever late on a payment. I had to have a cosigner since I didn't have credit. My parents tried that shit with that car and I told them \"if you take it from me then I'm going to stop paying the psyments, there's no sense in paying for something I'm not using. I have all the time in the world to financially recover from it but they would be screwed.\" Stopped that shit in it's tracks again and it reminded them of their place in my life at my age.\n\nEdited to add the second story.",

Make sure they have no way of gaining access to it or the contents inside. Inside most safes they have holes in the bottom for you to be able to mark the floor drill holes and put concrete anchors in so you can't move the safe from that location. Honestly if I wasn't off work because of this shit thats goin around id buy you one and have it shipped to your house with a tracking number so you can be ready for its arrival and not have to worry about them seeing it. \nI've been seeing waaaay more bullshit from fellow redditors parents than there should be and it makes me so angry for y'all that I can't unclench my damn teeth.",

The right way to do it is:\n\n- to talk to your child about the behavior you want changed, including why you want it changed. \n- then you listen to their side of the story, so they feel like they have a chance to explain\n- if you don't like the explanation or don't think it warrants an exception, you tell them what you expect, and say they will get 2 warnings.  On the 3rd time you will (insert punishment here)\n- you warn them the appropriate number of times, reminding them of how many they have left\n- you tell hmm you don't want to (punishment), but that they must obey the rules\n- after the 3rd time, you do (punishment), reminding them that you've of them up front and warned them multiple times\n\nCaveat - punishment shouldn't be taking their phone away for a week/month.  One day should do the trick, and will hopefully prove your point that you are capable of doing that again if the behavior isn't better.\n\nThe fear of losing their phone for a longer time should give them incentive to try harder.",

It's just too coincidental both people were playing with each other's emotions especially considering the \"I was just meming too\" is pretty commonly used. Better to run with what you said and just tell her straight on everything wrong with what she did IMO.\n\n\"Please don't play with people's feelings. Seriously, even if I had denied you, this friendship would just become awkward af and die out. Your foresight is terrible. The second you sent that message, our friendships fate was sealed. Unless that was your intention, that was a really bad move on your part. Goodbye, hope your tiktok does well because it looks like you're on track to ruining your life for it.\"\n\n\nNo need lying when you already have your evidence. ;)\n\nFeel free to correct me too, advice can always be taken on a topic like this.",

This happened at evening after i got home. On the morning she said it was a lie and \"her friends from her school told her to do so\" even through they don't even know me.\n So it was just a joke i believed in.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for all the replies. Here is a little bit more detail for those who care:\n We hanged out in a big company. That evening i asked her if she was going to hang out tomorrow but she said that she can't. I said ok and then she asked if i have girlfriend. I said no and i asked her the same she said no. Then she asked if i have crush on someone. I said no because i thought she would think that i have crush on other girl and not on her. She said she haves crush on someone but refused to tell me who.\n At this moment i decided its time to tell her that i have crush on her and she said that I was her crush...\nWell she said on the morning it was a lie and she actually haves crush on other guy... Just a joke...",

Next day she stays in her group of friends ignoring me, later I ask her if she's okay and just says \"CAN YOU FUCK OFF AND LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE!?\"\n\nSecond time, school trip, on the bus home me and another girl get talking for a few hours, get into some really deep stuff (for teenagers anyway), kiss, talk about how we're going to meet up and spend a few weekends together. Next day, she completely blanks me, and when I press her on it, she says \"sorry I made a mistake\", and proceeds to ignore me for... well...forever actually.\n\nThere was another really similar story, but don't know why girls kept on doing this with me.",

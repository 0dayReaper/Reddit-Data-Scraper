I do a lot of programming and let me tell you, a realtively well-written bot doesn't need more than 100 API requests per second to moderate posts on the largest subreddits.  Granted, this might not be enough for comments in extreme cases but I'm not actually sure, it still might work. And anything smaller than the largest ones won't even have a problem with the comments",

I had interest in it for sure in hs but first and foremost, I didn\u2019t want to date because independence is the shit.  The trade off was not having a regular booty call but the independence and lack of drama was worth it.  I wasn\u2019t a slut so I wasn\u2019t good with rando hookups.  If you genuinely have no interest in sex, meh, be you.  That in itself isn\u2019t indicative of some kind of mental issues.  Are you weird?  Yea in that you aren\u2019t a raging hormone but you are good.  Are you happy without sex?  Are you asking because you feel pressure to be a raging hormone and want to be like everyone else?  Live your life.  You\u2019re good.  Old man out!",

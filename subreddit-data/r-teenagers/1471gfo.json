    "postText": "My friend, who just had a breakup, calls me everyday and vents about his ex. My cousin calls me regularly and also vents about all the bs going on in her life.\n\nI don't feel confident enough to rant about my life to my friends so posting here.\n\nVacations are going on rn and I just kind study and work on college applications. I have started to have second thoughts about my major and don't want to talk to my parents about that. I know that if I change my mind I would kind of lose all my progress at this crucial moment.\n\nFor the rest of the day I am just bored and stressed and don't really want to do anything. I am done with playing games or watching series. I don't want to go out. I quit gym cuz I was alone there and no one was there to keep supporting me.\n\nThankyou for reading till the end and if you have any suggestions please tell me.",

    "postText": " I (M16) asked out a girl (F17) a little over a month ago, we were friends for a couple months before, but I got her number when I asked her out and we\u2019ve been talking more. About a week ago, she left me on read for close to a week so I assumed she wasn\u2019t interested, then she texted me and we just started talking again and things seem to be good. I deleted her snap and insta when she left me on read because I though she wasn\u2019t interested, but now we\u2019re talking again so idk if I should add her back.",

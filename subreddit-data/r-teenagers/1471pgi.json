    "postText": "For a couple weeks I have researched the topic of dopamine and that led me down a rabbit hole in which i realised why people cut themselves (scientific reasons). Trigger Warning: blood, suicide, cutting\n\nSo why do people begin to cut themselves? A lot of reasons but mostly feelings of self inadequacy or punishing themselves. When you for example work out you destroy your muscles which gives a slight pain sensation. But after the workout you feel better than before you worked out, why is that? Well that is where dopamine comes in. Dopamine is a hormone that releases to give a good feelings as a reward from the body. Dopamine releases when you for example have sex, do drugs, eat food, hanging out with people, work out etc. When we get the pain sensation there are a few hormones that makes us feel that like CRH or TRH.\n\nBut how does dopamine and CRH/TRH correlate to each other? Well when dopamine is high you obviously feel good which makes the pain hormones go down. But when you feel pain your dopamine hormones go down. But this is the tricky part. When dopamine releases and is finished with its job you actually feel worse than before that hit (in higher doses). This is why drugs are so addictive, you feel good but then worse so you crave that dopamine hit again. \n\nSo what does this have to do with anything related to cutting yourself/self harm? Well we know that when dopamine goes up pain then comes higher. That works in the opposite too. So when you cut yourself you release a lot of pain hormones. But then your dopamine levels rise which makes you feel good. This is why working out makes you feel good after a workout and why self harm makes you feel good. But this is the worst part, because after the pain and then dopamine hit your dopamine need to go down again which makes you feel worse again. This makes you crave that pain rush again which creates an addiction to self harm. \n\nRemember that i am just a 16yo guy. If you want the studies i used to conduct this then just let me know. This was a repost.",

I\u2019m unaware of if you\u2019ve ever come across someone someone who has a feeling of sweet pain. Sounds a bit weird but there\u2019s a common word for this in my native language. Think of it as the feeling that you get after wearing a tight ponytail for the whole day only to take it out after hours and run your fingers through a sore scalp, or walking around for hours in uncomfortable shoes to plop into bed absolutely tired and sore from the pain. But that soreness and pain almost makes resting more comfortable. Likewise though it\u2019s not a comparable situation in terms of its severity as far as cutting goes or the emotional aspect atleast it\u2019s not just distracting it\u2019s satisfying for many for the reason stated above. The pain just becomes addictive till their reliant on it. It\u2019s weirdly comparable to a drug addiction In that regard.",

Of course if you have clinical depression or other forms of mental health issues then it is bad. But if you are using it to your advantage like using it to escape your bad thoughts and feel good then go ahead. But use it in moderation like any other thing. Alcohol, video games, sex, heck even the gym. Its easy to go all in or no in but its hard to keep things in moderation.",

I've never actually gone out of my way to hurt a person. I've just felt the desire to. The most I've gone and done is to small bugs and animals.\n\nMy household was notorious for its seasonal flea problems, and my blood was the most attractive in the household to bugs. Before anyone else noticed them, I would be covered head to toe in bites. There were many times when I caught them and used my nails to clip their legs. Even though I know parasites and insects can't feel complex emotions, I put them next to each other and watch them wiggle around their broken or dead family. I just feel satisfaction in hurting what bothers me. However, once I realize it doesn't really care emotionally or its basically given up, I don't find it that entertaining anymore, so I just pop them",

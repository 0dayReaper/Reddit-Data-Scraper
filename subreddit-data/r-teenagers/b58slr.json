But its actually harmful on brain development, as the growing brain is chemically imbalanced, and adding an influx of foreign chemicals such as THC can actually alter the development of important synaptic receptors in your brain, while also furthering the chemical imbalance, perhaps permanently. That's why its a good idea to wait until your brain is fully developed before partaking in the sticky icky.",

A great example of this is weight loss. So many feel the inspiration, so few actually overcome all of the above influences and actually change their lifestyle. Although, in the case of the contrasting photos, it is objectively better NOT to overcome those things. \n\nIf I may take the liberty, I will say that drugs \"help\" people forget themselves and the top photo probably is the result of \"drugs\". Not a great look. Don't do drugs until you're a responsible person who has all their shit together, and never do meth or heroin. ",

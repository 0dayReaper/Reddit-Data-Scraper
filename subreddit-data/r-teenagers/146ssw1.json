Nudity should be treated like a natural thing why does it have to be made a taboo? The human body is so much more than that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add on to this. My danish parents always told me it\u2019s healthy to see \u201cnormal\u201d bodies instead of only being able to compare yourself with nude models or adult film actors. I absolutely think they are right especially with social media exposing everybody to the small minority of perfectly aesthetic people.",

Theft is often thought by parents to their children. Disregard to common rules and official law is rampant. \n\nNo wonder gypsies have very bad reputation. \n\nOnce someone is identified as gypsy or in any way is affiliate to that group, you can be certain that people who dealt with gypsies in the past, suddenly go to alert mode.

It was just a rally intrusive thought.)\n\nin college, I was bullied brutally.\n\nOne time, I got bullied terribly and that was the last straw.\n\nI lock myself in a basement for a month and work on a sentient suit thing. Basically like the microbots (from big hero six), but better.\n\nI even got into the minute details like ethical issues that might occur if it discharges and stuff. I even gave it a name, Larry.\n\nThen, I walked back to the college campus and bullied my bullies back.\n\nTwo of them commited suici\\*e and the third died of internal injuries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the interview.\n\nI was explaining everyone exactly how it works and the fact that I'd get panic attacks on remembering them.\n\nIt happened whenever I was alone with my thoughts so I always played music to stop them.\n\nI then ended up singing a really depressing song (Pray by emo) while having a panic attack in front of everybody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMan, my intrusive thoughts are weird. I'd call your intrusive thoughts polite if I could.\n\nThis is why I never let my mind speak to itself.",

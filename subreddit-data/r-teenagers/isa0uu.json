It\u2019s like when ur room smells bad but you\u2019re used to it, but then you go outside (or in this case get a full nights sleep) and come back in and realize how bad it was. I didn\u2019t realize how fucking exhausted I was till I went home for thanksgiving and knocked out instantly in the airport, again on the plane, again in the other airport while waiting for my dad and then in the car ride home.",

                            "comment": "So there is a primary rate for government backed loans set each year by the Department of Education based on the ten year treasury note (government back bonds).  Last years (Fall 2019 through Summer 2020) has a undergraduate rate of 4.53% and a graduate/master's student rate of 6.08% and a parent/money above graduate student normal amounts of 7.08%.  These loans are fixed interest rates per year (i.e. any loan during that year will always accrue interest at that rate).  Additionally, or instead, a student/parent can take a private loan at the rate set by the bank.  Based on the person's credit score that might be better than the government program loans but may not be fixed per year. It becomes a little more complicated with semesterly/yearly limits depending if you are supported by your parents (in the eyes of the DoE), lifetime limits, in-state (cheaper) vs out-of-state tuition vs liberal arts/private college costs.\n\nThis year (July 1st 2020 through July 1st 2021) the rates are lower because the US is in fucking chaos. 2.75% UG standard loan, 4.03% graduate standard loan, and 5.03% for graduate PLUS or parent loans.  These rates are the lowest they've been in the 10 years listed.\n\nThe lifetime limit in the standard section is $57,500 *for the student* with no upper limit as a parent but yearly limits based on standard budgets for average students.  At my state school, assuming a  parent and student takes the maximum loan every year with no other financial support, an out of state parent would probably rack up $160,000 in debt for a 4 year program and the student taking $27,000.  This does not include interest over the expected 10 years of repayment. This is also assuming the student completes their degree in 4 years with no summer or winter courses.",

Live at home if you can. Make sure they transfer to your goal university to do your major courses.\n\nOr, don't go to college right away. Get an entry level gig getting coffee, learn everything you can by asking for special projects. Do that for a couple /few years and then go to college. (See above.) Chances are you'll have a much better idea of what you want to do. \n\nOr don't go to college period. There's no rule that says you have to. Get a journeyman's apprenticeship. Do a coding bootcamp. Do a technical school instead. Get that entry level job and work your way up with experience instead of a degree. There are tons of jobs out there that don't require it. \n\nLive life and figure out who you are and what you want out of life before putting yourself through the education grinder.\n\nSource: 8 years with multiple gaps, 3 different majors and way too much stupid debt to get my bachelor's; 2 more years and even more debt to get my masters. Yes, ultimately it worked out for me and I have a good job making good money. But I'm sure there could have been a better way if I hadn't been constantly told that college was non negotiable.",

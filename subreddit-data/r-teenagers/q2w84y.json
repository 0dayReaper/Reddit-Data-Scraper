My kid just started high school, and already dealt with a kid threatening either a shooting or a bomb (details were not released) the kid said it was a \u201cjoke\u201d, but authorities took it seriously enough to put the kid in custody. Sick times we live in, a lot of angry lost people. The Sandy Hook shooting really got me, I never thought that would happen at an elementary school, I\u2019ll never forget that day, I heard it on the news at work, cried the whole way home that day. \n\nIt\u2019s just a daily fact of living here that you can be at any random place and someone can just decide today\u2019s the day their gonna open fire around here.",

All through my school years school buildings were open and easily accessible. If mom needed to pick me up for a doctor's appointment or just to bring in birthday treats for class she just walked right in the building and wandered to my class with no one knowing.  In high school the doors weren't locked down or alarmed. Sneaking in and out of school was ridiculously easy. The closest thing to school security was the disciplinarian, Mr G.\n\nMy freshman year of college I watched Columbine playout on the cafeteria TV and was shaken.\n\nBy the time my daughter was in preschool and kindergarten the all day lockdowns started. Have to be buzzed in if the busses aren't dropping off or picking up. Entire school layouts were changed so that now the main entrance was right next to the office and you never got past that point. NEVER. There have been entire school years where if I missed parent/teacher night I'd lost my only chance to actually see her class room. And then there's cops and school resource officers and oh, did I mention my daughter graduated from the same high school I did? \n\nI'm so very glad she made it out and into college. I can't imagine what it's like being in high school these days",

These bars slot into the door itself and then drop into a reinforced recess in the ground. The locking mechanism is entirely unreachable from outside, and it would take an inhuman amount of force to bend the bar. I think that's more what he's suggesting. They seem very effective.",

I still have giant mid century wood tables and desks in my room and a 10\u2019 long metal cabinet. There are at least half a dozen things that weigh over 100 lbs to barricade the door with. They wanted to remodel my room and I told them no. The plastic stuff breaks and it\u2019s also no good for barricading doors. I have a 100 lb stone table top that\u2019s a bit more narrow than the outward swinging door. If a shooter opens the door his privates or his feet are going to get smashed. If I have time I\u2019m gonna booby trap the place. We\u2019ve got fire extinguishers, table legs, razor blades, sheets of glass and a pile of claw hammers. I\u2019d waste no time organizing an army of teenagers to fight back. My message would be \u201cEveryone screamed like the devil and fight back if someone tries to get in that f*cking door.\u201d",

Tl:dr, kid was beating someone else in a classroom, teacher called for assistance, kid delivering the beating pulled a gun and shot 2 people with 2 more receiving an \"abrasion wound\" and the other refusing treatment, shooter ran to an attorney who drove him to the police to turn himself in.",

We would then turn off the lights. The thinking was that the room would look empty, so the shooter/intruder wouldn't even bother going in. I have no idea how well it would've worked, but I'm very glad that we never had to find out.\n\nEDIT: I should've mentioned it before. But we also locked the doors. I think a couple people beleive that we just sat in the room without the door locked, but that was not the case. The doors in the school were very sturdy, and while a normal person could potentially kick one in with enough effort, a shooter most likely wouldn't waste their time with it.",

That's not a concern I   ever had to have. There weren't drills or plans, it just wasn't a thing we prepared for. Columbine was really the only major, highly publicized shooting to happen before I was in high school. \n\nMy sister in law graduated from the same school in 2018. She'd talk about shooter drills very casually, like... Eh, it's just what we do. Same as fire and tornado drills. Every time, it threw me off guard. Both that it was happening, and that to her, it wasn't weird... It's just the way it was.\n\nI'm not intending to turn this into any kind of political debate... Just... What the fuck happened in this country? \n\nI'm glad you're safe OP. I seriously can't imagine what it must be like to be in this situation as a teenager.",

But you make a good point that the door opens outwards which is done via fire code. People get trapped, crushed, on a bottleneck when a door opens in. Google some club fires where that\u2019s happened. I do wonder though if it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to have inward opening classroom doors and a door wedge right next to it. Course that doesn\u2019t account for if the gunman starts in the classroom and in turn traps the students. It\u2019s a no win situation that does indeed require extensive gun control. This post seems to have been absolutely hijacked by pro gun nuts. Hopefully the mods will sort that shit soon because it\u2019s ridiculous",

The red dot symbolized the safest place in the classroom according to law enforcement and experts who came into the classes and inspected them. The lights were shut off, we all huddled together underneath the red dot or underneath desks (depending on the situation). Teachers went to lock the door then came to sit with us, but they were more propped up to be able to see what was happening. One teacher I had way back in elementary  also said \u201cI will barricade the door or whatever else with my body in order to protect each of you guys\u201d. At the time, she was also pregnant and a soon to be mom\u2026. Sad to look back upon these things and realize how much we had to practice and know these things.",

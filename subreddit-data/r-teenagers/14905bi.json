    "postText": "It's honestly so damn annoying to me when people brand anything that falls outside of the stupid social norms as \"cringe\". Also, it's completely arbitrary, some people think the entirety of the gender theorem is cringe, which sucks, and others say its tik tok girls dancing online, which also sucks.\n\nWhy are these people so dedicated to putting people down about who they are, why is it cringe to be a furry, or to be gay, or to be a dancer, all that stuff is just so freeing and fun, why is it that people in our age group feel the need to put it down, is it just insecurity?",

We only had 200 students between 9-12 so that might of been part of it",

I had friends in all grades too, it was more common to hang out with those you lived closer to, but again not always the case. Good to see other places are good like that. Enjoy it while you can! The saying \"highschool is some of the best years of your life\" is a pretty true statement. Have fun!",

My hopes were and kinda still are that when school opens I could see my friends more and feel something, so when 2nd quarantine comes around I can get on the right foot. I had hope for that... but now people are starting to say that we might not go back to school. So now there is no end in sight to this misery :/",

I'm fine with online school, since I find I can learn faster on my own anyways, and I reckon I'll be done with all the work a lot sooner than it says on the course. My only worry with this whole pandemic thing was that I'd be missing out on developing social skills through high school, since that's about the only thing I'm missing.

I need to try and put myself out there. \n\nI\u2019ve had a crush on a girl for a long ass time (am 18 so I\u2019m on the slightly older end of the spectrum for teenage awkwardness) and I feel that I\u2019m finally gonna ask her out once the social restrictions are lessened. I\u2019ve waited over a year debating whether or not to ask her or tell her I have feelings but I\u2019ve finally realised that life is short so fuck it.\n\nAfter a long time of nothing but rejections, I\u2019ve finally got a job in a warehouse. It\u2019s not much but I feel that it might help to give my life some framework and context again.",

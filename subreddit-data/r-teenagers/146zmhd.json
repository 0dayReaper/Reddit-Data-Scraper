    "postText": "So yesterday I was at an event, in which there was a dance. Generally at things there\u2019s one person who catches my eye, in this particular one I was with my friend, he\u2019s tall and hot, and this girl, she walks over to both of us, and then asks him if he has someone to dance with. I\u2019m not worried about nobody liking me, but I\u2019m worried about my type not liking me.\nI\u2019m just a pretty shy dude, but I seem to only like confident people, and confident people seem to like other confident people.",

The fact you don\u2019t wanna be seen \u201cweak\u201d by someone is a huge tell that you are ashamed of a weakness of yours and thus aren\u2019t confident",

Like, the update that brought about the change is unanimously known as the worst update, kinda bad.\n\nMost professional matches are still held independently on community servers. And progression in an official way is not apparent, if any is there.\n\nBut TF2 is still amazing. Unlocking weapons, trading your way to virtual hat wealth, and the feeling of improving in your skill is still great. Casual scene is still super important too, and the amount of hilarity that happens is part of the charm. \n\nThe first time you join a cult of heavies doing the conga over a cliff drop as a medic plays the accordion is magical.",

It makes an impact when such things are brought into the spotlight of popular websites. Mei being chosen to be a mascot for the HK protests wouldn't have gained traction if people didn't upvote posts about it.\n\nMaybe, if you can draw, draw some stuff for the protest.

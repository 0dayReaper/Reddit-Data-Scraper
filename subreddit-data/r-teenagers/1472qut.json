    "postText": "FINALLY found something im actually SUPER into that could be a career. I've freestyled for a while but I'm just now getting serious about getting better. Also tried getting into songwriting and I can write full songs in 10-20 minutes that are actually really fucking good. I just feel like I needed to tell someone. In really excited! I just need to practice vocalizations and beat making and I'll be set. Super pumped to finally have something to build towards. I have 5 songs already just today.",

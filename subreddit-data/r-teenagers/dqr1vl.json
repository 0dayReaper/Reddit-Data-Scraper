    "postText": "Backstory: I live round the corner from my gran and visit her often so thanks to me she has a vague grasp of what memes are and how they work. The other day when I was round at hers and she asked what memes were popular at the moment so I told her about the \"OK boomer\" meme. She knew what boomers were already so she was able to get the concept of this meme fairly easily. \n\nFast forward to today, I'm over at my gran's again, and she's on the phone to my aunt. They got into a disagreement over a slightly racist comment my aunt made the other day (my gran is very much against racism) and my gran eventually just said \"OK boomer\" and hung up.\n\nI've never been so proud.\n\nUPDATE: So I told my gran about this post and the reaction it got - she said she's glad that so many of you enjoyed her little joke and that it proves she's still young at heart. I agree with that 100%.",

Awhile ago my mom was visiting me and at one point in a conversation my mom asked how many years were in each generation so I went to Wikipedia to find the information.  I'm still reading through the Wikipedia articles about each generation since it is rather interesting, but here are the widely accepted birth year periods for each demographic cohort: \n\n\n+ [Lost Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Generation) : 1883-1900    \n+ [Greatest Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation) : 1901-1927    \n+ [Silent Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation) : 1928-1945    \n+ [Baby Boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers) : 1946-1964    \n+ [Generation X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X) : 1965-1980    \n+ [Millennials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials) : 1981-1996    \n+ [Generation Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z) : 1997-2012    \n\n\n\nedit: 1965.",

No one thinking about it in the first place leads to no good name.\n\nI think as that generation becomes more relevant and as we begin considering the name of the one after it, we'll reconsider and name it something more relevant than 'Generation Z'. Probably something like the 'Digital Activist Generation'.",

As a group, baby boomers were wealthier, more active and more physically fit than any preceding generation and were the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers#cite_note-Jones1980-3) They were also the generation that reached peak levels of income in the workplace and could, therefore, enjoy the benefits of abundant food, clothing, [retirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement) programs, and even \"[midlife-crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife_crisis)\" products.\\[[*clarification needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)\\] However, this generation also has been criticized often for its increases in [consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism) which others saw as excessive.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers#cite_note-Pinker-4)\n\nThe boomers have tended to think of themselves as a special [generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation), very different from preceding and subsequent generations. In the 1960s and 1970s, as a relatively large number of young people entered their late teens\u2014the oldest turned 18 in 1964\u2014they, and those around them, created a very specific [rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric) around their cohort and the changes brought about by their size in numbers.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers#cite_note-Owram1997a-5) This rhetoric had an important impact in the self-perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a \"shockwave\"[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers#cite_note-Owram1997-2) and as \"the pig in the python\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers#cite_note-Jones1980-3)\n\nHoly fuck dude.....",

The problem with Reagan isn't so much Reagan himself as it is that his policies are being taken as gospel truth rather than as reactions to the problems that the United States was facing in the Seventies.  Regional American businesses were taking a beating from large European and Japanese government-supported conglomerates, and the process of amalgamation and government support was critical in helping to protect the United States.  Many of his policies made sense in 1980, but anybody campaigning on a tax cut in 2020 either isn't thinking things through or has some pretty unfortunate ideas about the role of government in a competitive global economy.",

They grew up with rationing, bombing. By the time they were adults the war was already ending or over.\n\nThen the soldiers came back. The rationing ended. Their countries rebuilt. And everyone had fuckin' five kids. The baby boomers grew up in a world of plenty. Even the poorest of them had a life better than their parents. They got high quality education, cheap college, and excellent public services. All voted for and supported by those who had known hard times.\n\nThen they spent a decade enjoying drugs and debauchery, while paying lip services to freedom and liberty. When the summer of love ended, they found that they were the adults now. Older generations (not listed in this post) had died out or retired, leaving them the majority. They had control. Suddenly they were the status quo.\n\nThey didn't know the breadlines. They didn't know the bombings. Thanks to their larger than average population, they have controlled politics for generations. Every thing they were given, they have slowly ruined because they don't need it anymore.",

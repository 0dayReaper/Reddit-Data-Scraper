Honestly life will never get better if you don't work on any mental issues that might be keeping you down. Many of us have given up already but don't be one of us, work on yourself, keep doing the cool hobby you have, talk about your hobbies with people that care about them. Don't have such people? That's temporary and while you are seeking them, learn to enjoy things alone and be fulfilled. Choose the right university program and it could be a step to the best part of your life. World is a half chance and all that we have under our control is ourselves so take care of that self, cherish it and raise it. Take care of your inner child - teach him what confidence is and what areas are worth being confident about (freakin Legos obvs).\n\nLife never stops unless we die, nothing is decided and you have every chance to start something new and exciting. Even if it is something as silly as bug watching (bugs are awesome). Our lives are in our hands.",

Also dont even try to tell me about intersex, its a rare mutation most people with it just choose one of the other genders to identify as anyway.\n\nAnd please don't bring up xenogenders and neopronouns I want to make sure this post doesn't get the world record for fastest locked.",

I think the main problem is people dont understand that things like demigirl, genderfluid, gender flux, etc, are not technically genders in their own right but more an expression of the genders they are in a more concise way and an easier way to understand.\n\nAll in all, its mostly just misinformed people over exaggerating. I normally just ignore it unless they seem genuinely confused rather than hateful about it.",

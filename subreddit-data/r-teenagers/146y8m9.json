    "postText": "For context, I go to an online English class, and the teacher made everyone in class compete in some international essay competition for some reason. So, I wrote the essay entirely by myself, and then my teacher made me use gpt zero to check it it's written by ai. Even though I wrote it all by myself, it said it was partially written by ai. So I rewrite some of it and check it again, and it says it was entirely written by ai for some god damn reason",

So I need to make it so that my essay doesn't get flagged as AI. But when I go to change the damn thing, it gets from being partially written by AI to being entirely written by AI according to gpt zero",

    "postText": "So why I'm writing this is because I really am wondering if there is something wrong. I see people my age dating, going out with boys/girls, and having like so many guys in their dms that want them and stuff. But my life is nothing near that, I've never had like a \"serious\" relationship and any guy that was interested in me only wanted me for my body. I've never felt like anyone was genuinely interested in my character. There was a guy who I got his insta a week ago and he was asking me if I had a bf and stuff(my friends are saying he's interested in me) but I don't want to make a move bc I feel like I'm not good enough for him to like me. Is it normal for me to feel that way?",

I completely relate and I'm trying to work it by myself but there are those constant thoughts going around in my head, like why does everyone else has a boyfriend and not me? Or talking with my friends who have more experience in dating and then there's me, not having a clue about relationships and stuff and it just feels weird tbh. But yes we can get through it!! At the end of the day we don't need men we are better on our own!",

All this attention is like a fix for people like that, they depend on it. That\u2019s no way to live. Your normal don\u2019t ever think your not just because everyone else is different. Who knows maybe they\u2019re the ones who are abnormal.",

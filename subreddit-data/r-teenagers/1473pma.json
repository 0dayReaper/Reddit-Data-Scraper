    "postText": "Okay so me and her have been seeing each other for a little over a month now and its going pretty good. I have met her parents, we have gone a few dates, we enjoy being together and have a good time. When I am at work we will text (occasionally) at work and then talk more when I am out and when I am not at work we hang out in person about twice a week. She has been very open with her feelings and has told me a lot whats going on in her mind. Overall its been pretty good but there is something that is bothering me.  \nSo her and I got together about 3/4 months after she got out of a year-ish relationship which I understand she is still healing but the problem is she will keep bringing up her ex and stuff they did. It isn't constant but for example- we will be talking about cooking and then she will say \"do you wanna hear the funniest cooking story?\" and then proceeds to tell me about a story with her and her ex. Or we will be on a walk and she will tell me how her and her ex went there to see a sunset. Or she will tell me a story how she was in his room and his mouse burned on the desk.  \nUsually she tries to talk about it in a funny way and I think she may just being thinking about those memories because its on topic to what we're talking about but I can't help but feel jealous? I feel like I am being compared to him and that I will never be able to give her what she wants.   \nAccording to her, he is very buff and she has told me she really likes muscles. Like when I asked if there was anything that she missed from that relationship she told me \"I miss the muscles but nothing else. I  hate him and he hates me.\" While I want to believe she hates him I still feel like I am not enough. She has told me she really, really likes me and she \"adores\" me but when she brings him up it does hurt.   \nI apologize if I wrote this poorly, I am feeling kind of sad right now.",

She mentions story of her ex, so as a result you tell a made up story with your ex that goes in theme and try to emulate her tone as much as possible.\n\nOnce you've done this 3-4 times, ask her how she feels about it and when she answers that she doesn't like it, tell her that's how you feel.\n\nOr you could just tell her how you're feeling, but when has that ever gone well right?",

Since I was an only child, she was sort of like a sister figure to me. I remember some of my best childhood memories being catching pokemon with her and beating gym leaders. \n\nWhen my parents finally bought me a 3ds after begging for a long time, I got back into pokemon and played the games I missed (gen 3 onwards). \n\n\u2026Then I stopped playing games mainly because I thought it was affecting my highschool career. A few days ago, I graduated high school and decided to play pokemon black. I realised how much I love and missed this franchise. I plan on completing every mainline pokemon game this summer!",

Smart people know they're smart and attractive people know they're attractive and the ones that don't will just brush your compliment off. \n\nFor example: I have gorgeous hair. I'm not trying to brag here as it's my one redeeming quality. I get compliments on my hair from half the women I meet. At this point I just consider it par for the course. The only person I've ever had any serious crush on complimented things more oriented towards my personality. She told me I was funny, something nobody else had ever done. She told me I was smart, something nobody had ever done unless they were scolding me for poor performance in school. It was nice to have these other aspects of my person acknowledged for once and it really made me feel like I could be myself around her.",

In fact, if you compliment a guy on something hes passionate about, like a hobby or a sport, that\u2019ll make you stand out more.",

NBDSGSYAHHEYWYSGWFTW I just remembered because we spend a lot of time together where it\u2019s just us hanging out, once he asked me \u201chey so we\u2019ve been hangout a lot lately and talking more and I just wanted to ask you-\u201c and I FUCKING CUT HIM OFF by say \u201cyeah it\u2019s been so much fun\u201d \n\nThis.

Im on the other side, this girl who ive known for almost a year and had a crush on for about 7 months is always comfortable with being around me, making jokes about us two being married, having eye contact which lasts for like 30 seconds at a time, and always playfully touching each other. But, when i made initiative and asked her out to the movies, i was denied. Completely denied. Things were awkward as fuuuck between us, but eventually we got closer, but stuff isnt the same. I cant talk to her about anything i wanted to or rant about anything i wanted to anymore. Ugh, i wanna cry rn...... my close friends and friends (except for two) dont even want to hang out over the summer or even text. And it feels ive lost my best friend who also happens to be my crush.\n\nAnyway, im sure you two could still be great friends w each other. How are things rn?\nSorry for the stupid essay.",

But if we don\u2019t date, we can stay friends, for long time, and not ruin anything. I\u2019m sorry about this, you seem like a cool guy :(\n\nEDIT: your last part about loosing most of your  friends, it\u2019s happening to me right now too. No one texts me at all. Ever. I have to text first.  (Maybe like 3 people text me) And I even did like a test thing where I didn\u2019t text anyone for a full week and no one asked if I was okay. If you ever wanna talk, just message me :(",

My mother wasn't abusive but she was a single mother and we were facing homelessness so I was taken out of school in fourth-grade barely knowing how to read and never really went back to school. I developed social anxiety that was so bad I couldn't take a bus on my own. I had to struggle for a long time to get my GED, which I eventually did get in 2017 and now I'm trying to get an associate in college and can now take the bus on my own, lol. I wish you the best and hope everything goes well for you.",

    "postText": "Her whole life was spent in loneliness and domestic abuse, until a year or so ago when we became friends. It was really nice seeing her becoming more open and nice to people, but yesterday happened a thing I couldn't have predicted. I told her that I started dating a girl in our group, it turned out she liked her too, and that's when shit hit the fan. Today, in an outburst, she texted me that she had a lot of suicidal thoughts, and the only thing keeping her alive was distracting herself from it. She almost immediately deleted the message. I'm not a feelings guy at all, and need advice here. Anyone?",

            "comment": "I read the whole thing. I'm getting mad Coraline vibes from this, since the dream-world place seems to be an escape from an unfavorable reality. Since she obviously has a horrible life in the real world, it isn't bold to assume she'd take to a dream-like fantasy world as a form of coping. The way you describe things is very clear and understandable, which I applaud you for, since that's one of the harder things I struggle with in writing. I also like the established character dynamics, with Esmond being prideful in his magic and letting his ego do the talking most of the time, and with Delane low-key resenting him for his arrogance. The only criticism I have is that her parents seem overly abusive to the extent that it's unrealistic (I'm deeply hoping it doesn't reflect your own experiences), and in my opinion breaks the flow of the story. This is great nonetheless, and I hope you write a full novel. Oh yeah, and I did notice the trans themes in the chapter, and I'm guessing Charlotte is trans herself, but please do correct me if I'm wrong.",

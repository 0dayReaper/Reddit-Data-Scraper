She referred to this as \u201chaving strings attached\u201d.\n\nWhen I opened the gift there was an iphone box with a kite string sitting on top of it. I didn\u2019t understand so I looked at her questioningly for about ten second then said \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d. She just smiled at me. So I moved the string to get to the box and she quickly put the string back on top. I gave her another thirty seconds to say something then moved the string again just for her to move it back.\n\nAfter five solid minutes of practically pleading for her to tell me what the hell she was getting at I gave up and left the room . She didn\u2019t understand why this might be frustrating.",

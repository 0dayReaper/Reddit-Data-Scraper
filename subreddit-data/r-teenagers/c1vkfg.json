I attended every lecture and went to every lab, but still my grades were really bad. Then I discovered Khan Academy and started watching its biology videos. Not only did those videos help me remember the material, but they saved my grade! Not to mention I use to hate biology until I started watching videos about it on Khan Academy, now I actually really like biology.",

I went most of my high school without a math teacher because they all managed to get themselves fired or quit before the end of the first semester. \n\nWe had one freshman year but he was unable to return after an illness or something like that, and that\u2019s the last time I feel like a TEACHER taught us something. After that it was just various online sites like ALEKS and IXL or some other bullshit.\n\nSure, we managed to get grades, but I still don\u2019t know shit about math and the career I wanna pursue relies on it apparently.\n\nPrivate school btw",

Few years later played around with C# and later Python. Come 10th grade im doin C++. Now im about to be a senior and writing a fuckin game engine with all the bits and bobs youd expect from someone who went to school for it in C++, \n\nNot tryna pull the \"oh im so smart look at me\" thing. Literally anyone can do it with enough effort. If it wasnt for Khan academy and its programming shit, I wouldnt be doing anything programming wise. \n\nHope some younger kids see this who might be interested in programming hop on it ASAP. That website will get you on the right track.",

Hit all the basics and finish up the Object Oriented section. This will give you a solid footing as really all you need to be learning at this point is flow control and the basics of object oriented programming.\n\nFrom here, id recommend Python. Although I personally dislike Python, the environment is great and writing in it feels similar to just talking out loud - very smooth. The language is slow and extremely high level (meaning you dont have a ton of control), but its so imporant that you actually get your head around working with other people's APIs and get you started on how to structure a program.\n\nFrom there its really up to you. If you feel like you are ready to take the dive and hop into some tricky stuff, C++ is IMO amazing, but it gets plenty of hate as poorly writin code has consequences and the language is a bir massive.\n\nFor those out there wanting to learn C++ eventually, I recommend [this book over C++ 11](https://www.amazon.com/C-Programming-Language-4th/dp/0321563840) although I think a newer edition is out. I read that book almost religiously and tried applying as much as possible. Took me from writing crappy code to decent code. The beautiful website [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is your best buddy for problem solving, it is also a great way to get introduced to new features as C++ is huge and no one source will show you everything (plenty of it is redundant anyways). Google is your best friend with sites like [c++ docs](http://www.cplusplus.com) giving you a much deeper look into a feature.\n\nThe only language ive gotten into any real depth with is C++; but I imagine a good book, stack overflow, and online docs will do the trick.\n\nYou are (probably) going to screw up many many times before you right solid code no matter the language. Just dont give up and keep going! The best way to learn when it comes to this stuff is doing!\n\nMost of programming is just architecture, and its something you can only learn through doing. \n\nIf you need help in the future, or anyone else for that matter, feel free to PM me, id be glad to help.",

If we had 50 potatoes and Sally has 300 ap-app-appl-apples.\u201d\n\n2b) Because the videos are in real-time, there\u2019s a lot of excess \u201cfluff\u201d in them. They don\u2019t get to the point fast enough and I find myself skipping a lot of the video because it\u2019s not needed.  A 10 minute video could easily be cut down to 5 minutes. (Again, see 2 - him sounding everything out eats up time quickly)",

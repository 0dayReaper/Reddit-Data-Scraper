    "postText": "Ok so my parents fight a lot, arguments not an actual fist fight or anything,  and one day at midnight I was in my room and I just hear yelling from upstairs. After nearly an hour of this I decided to record from my phone the fact I could hear what they were saying, my plan was to text it to them to try and get them to shut up, but I realized that was a stupid idea\n\nThe next day I show the video to my brother, mostly to laugh at my parents, we\u2019ll yesterday my brother ratted on me saying that I had recorded the video and told her that I said \u201cI know your having your temper tantrum right now but it\u2019s fucking midnight and I\u2019m trying to sleep\u201d \n\nCurrently I\u2019m at my grandmas house (my mom said this happened via text and asked to see the video) I go back in a day, what do I do to avoid death",

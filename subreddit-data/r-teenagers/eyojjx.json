He doesn't smoke but he occasionally drinks. He's in bed by 11 PM. And makes sure to get 8 hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed,  He usually has no trouble sleeping until morning, just like a baby. He wakes up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. He was told there were no issues at his last check-up.  I'm trying to explain that he's a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. he takes care not to trouble himself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause him to lose sleep at night. That is how he deals with society, and I know that is what brings him happiness. Although, if he were to fight he wouldn't lose to anyone.",

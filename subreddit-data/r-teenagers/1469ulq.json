Yes the subway smells like piss and is full of homeless people, but it's faster and less frustrating than driving(just for the city, anywhere else and you need a car)\n\nSkip Times Square, it's a tourist hellhole and someone will steal your wallet if you walk too slow\n\nYou can pay whatever you want at the Museum of Natural History(and others) so don't be afraid to ask for a lower ticket price\n\nIf someone offers you a cab ride at an airport, DO NOT TAKE IT. It's a scam and they'll charge you shit tons of money for a 2 mile ride. Remember what I said about not driving? It's ok to take a cab from the airport, but make sure you booked it yourself\n\nThere are some great places outside the city if you're willing to drive. Some near me are the Katonah Museum of Art, the John Jay Homestead, and the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. The first two are fairly crowd free and are mostly visited by locals, but you will need to drive about an hour outside of the city. Other more popular attractions not in Manhattan are the Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden, and various mansions along the Hudson River\n\nEdit: those cabs you see all over New York City go literally everywhere(I've heard of people taking them to Albany, which is 3 hours away). But I wouldn't recommend taking them outside of city limits because they get very expensive very quick. Just take an Uber or something",

NEVER come across as being incapable of finding your way. NY is a place, like many others, where people will try to take advantage of you. Whether it be pickpocketing or mugging, just be aware of your own surroundings.",

You can be black and go through town and nothing will happen at all. \n\nGun violence is not as common as most think. It happens but not as near as much as you think.  Don't be alarmed when you see people loading guns into the car  or having guns on their hips is completely normal.  Most of the time just going to a range. If you get the chance to go shooting it's pretty fun and might give it a try. \n\nAlso when you go get food the little mom and pop restaurant is almost always the best food in town. Don't eat at fast food places. \n\nDo not engage with overly political people both sides can be assholes. Just turns into a shit show. \n\nWe are also just very talkative and overly polite. Don't be alarmed if strangers just try to have a conversation with you. \n\nHave fun and don't worry \ud83d\udc4d",

It's a holiday celebrating when america became indipendent from england, so we're supposed to be celebrating that but tbh people just blast 5 million fireworks, sparklers, parties, (I've seen caroling but less common), hamburgers, and overall just a fun time. It's flippin crazy though if you go to one of the big parties so make friends and keep them close if you want to go to a big party. Nethertheless, the holiday's so much more fun with others. Also i suggest not getting into a relationship unless you plan to live there for a while just cause long distance sux",

            "comment": "I'm not familiar with NYC but assume it's safer from hate than the South and Mountain states. Violence is generally overblown and most places in America are not particularly dangerous despite what you see on the news. Remember there's a third of a billion of us, so seeing bad stuff on the national news everyday doesn't imply it's unsafe everywhere. Right now it's open season on trans people pretty much, but most large cities are safe and most Americans are nonconfrontational unless you're the one starting a negative interaction.\n\nTipping is an employer scam, but still expected for waitstaff and bartenders. If they serve the food to you on a table (as opposed to takeout, or self-serve like buffet, or some fast food places; basically if you're expected to sit down *before* ordering, then tipping applies), 15% of the final meal price is for average service, 10% is for bad service, 20% good, and 25% if there's something really extraordinary. Remember separate checks are harder for waitstaff to manage, so having a group of eight with seven different checks is asking a lot unless you're tipping well. In a very fancy hotel you may be expected to tip the valet and/or the carrier. Other situations will recommend you tip if they expect it. A \"tip jar\" at the register does not indicate that a tip is expected unless it's for bartenders or something; these are common in some places despite it not being an expectation.\n\nAmericans are smell averse, so deodorant is always expected. Most don't wear perfume, but if you do, it's best to keep perfume or cologne light so you can't smell it unless you're very close, like hugging. If you eat a lot of very, very spicy food and have poofy hair you should wash it at least twice weekly as the smell can collect. Very few people need to worry about that, though. Also bathing or showering with soap a couple times a week minimum is recommended, though some hairstyles and types (mostly Black peoples' hair, dreads, and special perms) don't require washing that frequently.\n\nIn most places people defer to other cars and don't block the road, because if you're in a car you may be going somewhere important (and Americans are often impatient). In poor neighborhoods this is not always the custom and cars may be expected to wait behind stopped cars or people in the road if people there are talking.\n\nMost people in urban places don't walk in muddy areas so doormats are more of a decoration than a need. It would not be seen on offensive to have a doormat with the US flag, but it a place like India that would be extremely inappropriate. All establishments (unless explicitly listed otherwise) allow shoes to be worn throughout. At a private residence it's usually polite to leave your shoes in the foyer by the front door, but it depends on the person.\n\nAmericans tend to be very prudish about PDA and full nudity, but light kisses and barely covered parts are generally okay. Nipples on breasts are not legal to bare in public in most places. Apart from this, the customs are similar around the world. Don't be abnormally aggressive or creepy to women and you'll be fine.\n\nCustomer service is super important to Americans, so you don't usually have to worry about customs other than tipping. They'll smile and be polite even if they don't like you, unless you're clearly trying to offend.\n\nSome places have minor religious customs but NYC is pretty cosmopolitan. Generally it's seen as rude (by religious people) to use religious-related words as invectives or modifiers, as well as the use invectives in general. The rest of us don't care. It's safest to avoid cussing if children are present. Be very careful to avoid showcasing or discussing anything remotely sexual in nature when kids are present: some people will get super pissed and assume you're a pedo. Most Anglophone countries are like this.\n\nLaws are usually reasonable. The only laws you're likely to accidentally break are parking violations, which generally carry a small fine.\n\nThat's all I can think of. For the most part American customs are not strict, so it's much easier to visit or immigrate here than it is for many Asian and European countries.",

Coming to NYC expecting to experience the wonders you\u2019ve heard about America is another.\n\nNYC is a very \u201cglobal\u201d city\u2026 the people there have their own \u201cculture\u201c so to speak, and many of them have never left except to go to other enormous cities and/or abroad to other countries. It\u2019s a very old city but also very developed, which leads to problems like not having alleyways for dumpsters\u2026 so the entire city sets their trash BAGS (not even cans) right out on the main streets. The sights, smells, filth everywhere, and GIANT mutant rats all over the place are something to behold. The people are very \u201cself-involved\u201d and can be quite rude as well. It\u2019s a generally accepted rule to not look at other people and remember to ignore the mentally insane while they act out on public transportation, for instance.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to try great cheap food, see beautiful nature, meet friendly people, and experience some of the \u201cGod, guns, and freedom\u201d type culture you\u2019ve seen on TV that America is known for, anyone who knows what they\u2019re talking about will tell you to go just about literally anywhere else but NYC.\n\nNYC is about spending money to have prepared experiences made available to you, similar to any big global city, but worse. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re into, go for it. If you\u2019re looking to have your own experience with authentic America, try flying into somewhere like Omaha, Raleigh, Dallas, Phoenix, Key West, Denver, or Boise instead.",

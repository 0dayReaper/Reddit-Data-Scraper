When I heard that directx [12]?  was locked to Win10, I said I would switch when a game required it and would not support 10-11, or w/e is on Win7.\n\nThen i started hearing about forced updates, ads in startmenu,  and other obnoxiously hilarious things, I laughed and said fuck it. \n\nI was on XP until Win7 hit SP1 I believe. The only OS i jumped ship from asap was Win 98SE to XP, of course ignoring the hilarious ME and whatnot.. I will probably be on 7 until something better than 10 comes along.  Another big reason is hardware.  My hardware was top of the line 6-7 years ago when I built this rig, and still plays new games well enough for me.  No doubt spending the money on enthusiast level hardware helped extend my lifetime because before this i was upgrading every 2-3 years or so.  I have my doubts that my system will easily upgrade to 10 without hiccups due to it's age.  I am looking into parts these days, but I have more pressing matters than to get a fancy PC atm.  Especially to replace one that works flawlessly.",

And it didn't stop there, instead of using it's usual 1gb RAM it gobbled up almost 2GB and my video games still suffered because there was not enough ram... as Chrome had used 2.6GB of Ram - right after launching it and Slack(which somehow uses Chrome in it's shell)..  well, for Work reasons I can't close either of them and I was forced to upgrade from 8GB to 24GB as 16gb kit was cheapest option.

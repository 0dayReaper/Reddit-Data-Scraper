    "postText": "This ranked off feeling not like the actual issues it can cause. I did take into account the day after tho. I was in a psych ward for awhile, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been on these. \n\nAll of these are short acting, like given when needed. \n\n\nBenzodiazepines (Xanax and friends ) - 6/10. Like a green filter was placed over my eyes. Felt like moving through water, and severely sedated but best sleep of my life. Next few days felt like I was stupid tho. \n\n-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\nVyvance (meth basically)- 0/10 put me in psychosis \n\nThorazine- 4/10 FELT AMAZING but the next day was hell. \n\nHaldol- 8/10 literally Thorazine feeling wise but the day after felt normal even though it\u2019s a stronger medication\n\nTrazadone- 1/10 tired for a few days\n\nVisteral- 4/10 actually helped me when I was having PTSD problems but next day was like my IQ lowered by 40 points.\n\n\nAny questions feel free to AMA.",

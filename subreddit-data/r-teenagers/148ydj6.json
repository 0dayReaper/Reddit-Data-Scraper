My face looks super young. It\u2019s worse in the airport. I recently just visited my Dad who lives in another state and I was constantly getting asked \u201cAre you lost?\u201d \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d \u201cWhy are you alone?\u201d As I was exiting the plane flight attendants behind me were like \u201cLook at the little boy flying by himself. He\u2019s so brave and cute.\u201d I like the compliments of being called cute but I would rather be tall and to look my age. I was looking after my baby sister in target one day, an old guy behind us walked past and said \u201cLooking after your little sister? Good boy.\u201d First time in my life a random grown ass man called me a \u201cgood boy\u201d",

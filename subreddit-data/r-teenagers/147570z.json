    "postText": "17m\n\nSo there's this girl, she's amazing and i like her. We sometimes talk with each other at school(never text), but when we do it's a pretty good time. I sometimes notice that we make eye contact. Based on what I've heard from classmates, i am 70% convinced she likes me. I feel like not texting her would be a mistake. But there's a but.\n\nAs everybody knows School is ending soon. She is going on a vacation earlier (tomorrow). I was thinking about texting her, but the fact that she's not gonna be in the city makes this even weird. Needless to say it's a little too late to text her, it's 12 pm. \n\nThat's one problem, the other one is that if i was to be successful, i don't know what we would do. The city we live is small, 9k people. The timing also makes this more awkward. And also i am kind of an introvert, so there are not many places i could probably hangout with her. I live with my brother in my room and when he is not home, my parents are. I kind of feel awkward bringing a girl house. I am also broke with no job.\n\nMaybe I'm being delusional just because i had a good time taking to her, maybe she didn't?\n\nRight now i am thinking that waiting for the next school year to start would be a better option than texting rn.\n\nWhat should I do? and sorry for writing so much.",

    "postText": "AITA for spending about 50 soles in snacks?\n\nFirst of all im 14 so i dont have any way to get money. So i was going to a place with my dad and my brothers friends. We stopped at a gas station store because I was going to buy something. My dad gave me a 100 soles bill and i spent 10. Suddenly my brothers friends left the car and went to the gas station with me. I had already paid my snacks and i told my brother to spend the change (i assumed my dad had told them to buy something because they went to the store) and then when we all came back to the car my dad got mad and told me i have to pay for everything now because he never told me to give them the rest. AITA?",

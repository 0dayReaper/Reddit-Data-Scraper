    "postText": "So basically, last night I was at a sleepover with 4 other friends and later in the night one of the got on top of me and kissed my forehead as a joke. A little while later he kissed my lips instead and I say as a joke \u201cthat doesn\u2019t count you didn\u2019t use your tongue\u201d then he gets on top of me and starts kissing me with tongue, and I enjoyed it. A short while later he does it again, and again I enjoy it. Like an hour or two after that I\u2019m sitting next to him on his bed and I try to get over him and end up on top of him, and I say \u201cdo you want a kiss?\u201d As a joke then we ended up making out for like 30 seconds straight. He\u2019s bi but one of the friends and the sleepover asked earlier today if we were going out and he said nah so I don\u2019t know what to take from this experience. all I know is I had my first kiss, it was a guy and I enjoyed it",

If you think you might be bi based on your experience, that's awesome! Just remember that labels are personal and you get to define your own identity.\n\nIt's important to have open and honest communication with your friend about what happened and how you both feel. It's possible that it was just a fun moment between friends, but if you're curious and want to explore your feelings further, it's worth having a conversation to see where things stand.\n\nRemember, there's no rush to figure everything out. Take your time, trust your instincts, and be true to yourself. You're slayin' it by embracing who you are!",

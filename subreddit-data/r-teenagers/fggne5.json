It's not pretty to let a pet go, but sometimes it really is better for them.",

But it turned out to be one of the easiest.\n\nMy mother in law had fallen and broken a hip. She was cognizant for a few days and we were talking about surgery and the following rehab. She fell into a coma after about three days.\n\nThen, her body just started to give up. Her organs were shutting down, one by one. She couldn't speak or respond. Over time she would have lost circulation to her limbs. Finally, she would have lost control of her bladder and bowel.\n\nMom was always incredibly sensitive about these last items. The idea that we could, maybe keep her alive for a few weeks, unconscious, at the price of watching her fade as she defecated and urinated on herself was so unsettling. She would never have wanted such a thing.\n\nSo, my wife and I made the decision to take her off the ventilator. She died an hour or so later.\n\nIt was so sad, but it was an easy decision. And the right one.\n\nAnd the same is true with animals. We all have an expiration date and I have had to make the same choice with many pets over the years. Once they are dying and in pain or distress, it is the kindest thing you can offer. \n\nIt is, I think, an absolute obligation. This pet has been faithful to you and offered friendship and companionship for years. Maybe their entire life. Rather than let them suffer and eventually die in pain, it is more gentle, kinder, to let them go in peace and end the pain.",

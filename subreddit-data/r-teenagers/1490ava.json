    "postText": "So i was talking to this girl since December. Recently we start talking more occasional flirting and i thought maybe things would escalate since i saw the signs. But nope. Out of the blue she ended up making out with a guy in a car on a date and getting with him the next day. Now mind you im not some selfish shithead who isn\u2019t happy for her. What i am upset about is the signs she led me on with only to end up breaking my heart like this. And once i opened up about everything she started acting like i was a dick and she got upset with me. Cant really talk to anyone about this so im posting it here to just get this all off my chest.",

    "postText": "She was driving the forklift, poorly as new workers do. The day was almost over so we didn't have anything left to do. Most of us just waited the shift out and followed as the girl operated the forklift. It was bad, so we tried to give her advice. She asked other people to step in for her cause the pallet she was lifting was getting stuck. We refused because the only way to learn this stuff is through experience. \n\nI think it might've made her feel really bad. I've heard rumors of complaints, apparently she was under the impression we were laughing at her, and I totally understand how the situation could be interpreted like that. We honestly just wanted to help, it's not easy driving a vehicle like no other in a crammed warehouse space without prior experience. I'm gonna try to find her and ask her to step out for a while tomorrow so I can formally apologize and tell her that we're here to help.\n\nAnd I'm a new guy too I've only worked there for 4 months. God, my situational social awareness sucks.",

His family is very ashamed of it and he is the most anti-fascist and anti-bigotry person I know. Another friend of ours once asked him what would do if he as able to meet that Nazi relative and he said \u201cI would probably let him countine his tree so I could be born then kill him.\u201d I remember he talked about how his Dad found a container of that relatives Nazi memorabilia in his grandmothers house (They hadn\u2019t moved in like forever). They donated what they could to museums (most of it the museums didn\u2019t want) and destroyed the rest via hammer then burning it. They made a whole day out of it apparently.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is - don\u2019t judge someone for what their family tree has done. Judge them for their actions. Descendants from the axis powers can be amazing and pro equality people. Descendants from allied powers can be terrible, scum of the earth bigots. Hell I am pretty sure a lot of relatives of Hitler fought on the allied side.\n\nEdit: this what I was referring to with my last paragraph: https://www.history.co.uk/articles/how-hitler-s-nephew-fought-against-him-during-wwii",

He asked everyone as to who made the two boys wet, no one replied because no one did it. Do you know what was his solution?\n\n\n200m rounds of our whole basketball courtyard 50 times followed by jumping jacks until the next class ends.\n\nI passed out on what I think was the 34th round and when I woke up at home, I saw my mother, like I never saw her before. She was REALLY mad. You could see the red glint in her eyes. The teacher really fucked up because 3 more kids passed out. He was kicked from the school.\n\n\nThe quiet kid brought cake in the celebration because he, too passed out",

I watch the fight, doing ABSOLUTELY nothing. A teacher comes over with the rage of a thousand lions and accuses me of fighting, I'm Mexican btw. My brother, who looks less tan than me and is in football. Told the teacher I did nothing. She believed him, but not me. Next day, the principal follows me down the path to the sidewalk till my mom intervenes and calls him out.",

This can save a life an many situations, not just trauma or disasters.

Don\u2019t worry about breaths, mouth to mouth is the least important part. Just put your hands in the center of the chest and pump hard and fast two inches deep, about twice per second, and don\u2019t stop until help takes over. That is all you really must know.",

I described him and my friend said I was describing his friend. I then told him about this. My friend then became less distressed and choked out \u201cat least I taught him something\u201d.\n\nNot looking for karma.

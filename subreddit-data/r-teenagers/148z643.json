    "postText": "He always gets angry at my mom for stupid things and yells at her. He's directed his anger toward my mom for a long time and I know his anger issues aren't his fault but he won't even try therapy or anything. He's also mean to me too and has said stuff like Imm the most hateful person he's ever met (his brother is a literal racist so idk what hes talking abt??) and I don't deserve anything. He's said a lot of times I don't deserve anything. I don't remember the last time he's said the words \"i love you\". It has to be when i was really little the last time he said that. He still thinks my childhood meltdowns were behavior issues even though Imm already diagnosed with a disorder and abt to get tested for autism. He likes my brother more than me. He'll drive for hours for my brother's band stuff but complains driving me 5 minutes away to therapy. My mom says my anger issues were genetic but I'll bet it was because of the exposure to his anger issues as a little kid. And the difference between us is I'VE tried to help myself and go to therapy and he hasn't. He's so much nicer to my brother than me.\n\n\n\nA little bit ago, I heard him yelling at my mom, who was sleeping with a bad toothache. He yelled at her after she asked for some medicine, saying she was faking just to get more medicine. Which is stupid bc she went to the dentist just a little bit before that and obviously has tooth problems. I wanted to yell at him but I knew it would do nothing.\n\n\n\nAnd ppl think it's weird I'm so attached to my teacher and miss him so much during the summer. Obv when my dad is a dick and dives me no attention or support i'll seek it from another adult male.",

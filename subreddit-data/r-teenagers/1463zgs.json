(I have a brother) it\u2019s a good thing my wrists aren\u2019t muscular; I slip out after loosening the knot for about 5 minutes. I ungag myself, and sit up. [name] is driving down a country road. I recognize it instantly; it\u2019s only a few minutes from my house.*\n\n\u201c[name], what is going on? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in Alaska on a missions trip?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh crap you\u2019re awake?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 what the heck is happening and why was I tied up?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one word: Jacob.\u201d\n\n*It all makes sense now. Jacob is a good friend, but he scares me sometimes. He turns around in the passenger seat, and starts to laugh. Another friend is in the last row of the van*\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going Airsofting.\u201d Jacob says. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we talked to your parents.\u201d The other friend chimes in. You woke up so late we had to have a little fun with it.\u201d \n\n*My crush (and girlfriend) laughs from the drivers seat as we head to Battalion.*\n\nIt\u2019s an idea. There\u2019s only one problem with it. My girlfriend can\u2019t drive, so I think it would be the other two kidnapping me. But that\u2019s probably how it would play out.",

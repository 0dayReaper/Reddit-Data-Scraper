It\u2019s loud, too loud, and full of people, too many people, and I don\u2019t know many songs (it was a gift my uncle gave to my mother at Christmas). I hate concerts. I\u2019d like to be anywhere else atm. Luckily there\u2019s only 30 minutes left",

If I ever got to see my current favorite band it\u2019d be weird but I\u2019d love it. Next time I\u2019ll bring earplugs. I hate loud noises",

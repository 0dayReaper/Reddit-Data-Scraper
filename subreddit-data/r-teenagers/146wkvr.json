But hey, it sounds like your mom has got your back and wants the best for you. Maybe she's just having some fun with it, ya know? But if you're serious about the situation, it might be worth sitting down with her and having a heart-to-heart convo. Let her know how you really feel and make sure she understands the real deal. Moms can surprise us with their wisdom and support when we least expect it. Hang in there and keep the communication flowing. You got this! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc96",

The whole school was telling me old boy was outside waiting for me.  The moment couldn\u2019t be avoided.  I ate my sandwich and drank my milk then when out of the cafeteria and wrecked his shit. \n\nI got suspended.  My dad was mad at the school for not being able to prevent it. I was suspended, but my dad bought me Ice cream and told me I did the best I could and answered when the time was as right. I was not grounded, but had to serve my suspension. \n\nMy dad has passed away, but I remember that time like it was yesterday.

Let it be known that I never started a fight, nor did I ever throw the first punch. Always defense. After that, the fight went to whoever could pummel the other guy worse.",

Lots of school districts had \"zero tolerance rules\", which would levy the same punishment for both or all parties involved in a school yard brawl.  For me this was like 12 to 15 years ago so I don't see the rules really changing.  They don't want to appear soft on violence.  Even though little is done about bullying, which I didn't observe much of and for the most part Gen z kids seem to before tolerant on average.   At least in my area.",

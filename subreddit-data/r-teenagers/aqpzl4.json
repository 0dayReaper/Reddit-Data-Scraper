His casket on the engine led by a piper, his casket being lowered down off of the hose bed, his son who is firefighter and a longtime friend of mine carrying his dad's helmet into the church in front of the casket, I just got a bit teary eyed. When they did the final call over the county wide radio and dispatch cleared him as serving his final tour and 30+ years of service I choked up, when the bagpipes drones started and they began blaring Amazing Grace, I was done. Bagpipes playing certain tunes will choke me up, no matter the funeral. \n\nI didn't cry at all at my grandpa's funeral until the piper began playing after the priest finished his speech. He was an Air Force vet and Sheriff's Deputy and the Sheriff's Office sent out 2 pipers for his funeral. \n",

In school everyone avoids talking about the shooting as a whole, (for those of you who don\u2019t know the freshman building is fenced off) so we don\u2019t really go near that. You don\u2019t really feel much different except for the occasional emptiness. Around once a month we have service dogs that come visit which is nice, oh another thing. People now walk around with service dogs which is weird, but it doesn\u2019t really change the overall school atmosphere\n\nHope this answers your question, if you have anymore feel free to ask",

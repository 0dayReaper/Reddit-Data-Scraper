    "postText": " \n\nWhen I was young, I really loved og ninjago since 2011, but I often saw people say that the show became bad after like, 7? I left ninjago at season 6 since 2016 but i vowed to return.\n\nI but last year i binged watched all of it and before i even bingewatched it all a couple of times a before i do though i saw people hating the new seasons. in 2022, I managed to bingewatch Ninjago all the way to Season 14, and I really enjoyed them by the heart(Many didn't enjoy 11, a couple didn't really enjoy 12), but when season 15 released, i was so controversial toward it, but when new season dragons rising sequel released, I really enjoyed the first season of the first part and the 2nd part of it is coming soon idk when.\n\nBut there I have it, I saw a post in the memes subreddit shitting on that sequel season 1 with 38 thousand votes and it's something I literally enjoyed.\n\nWhy is it that people say that the new seasons suck? Does no one enjoy them? Seasons 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 are amazing masterpieces to me just like the old seasons like seasons 1, 4, 5, 6.\n\nHowever, I don't really like season 15 that much, but it looks like the new season dragons rising season 1 is gonna redeem it I really hope.",

    "postText": "First and foremost: I DO NOT CONDONE THE EXORBANT PRICES. With that out of the way, let's jump right in.\n\nI have been a member of Reddit for about two years now (my old account, u/ROYALFLAME123 got suspended for no reason). I am a very average Reddit user. I only really browse a few subreddits, primarily r/Undertale, r/Deltarune, r/ralsei, r/me_irlgbt, and r/aromantic, among select others.\n\nI have heard of the third-party apps that got hurt the most by these (horrendous) API changes, including Apollo. With that being said, I have not used any of these TPAs, either out of laziness or not having issues with the official app/website.\n\nNow, let's deal with the most controversial part of this post: the black-outs. The black-outs have been nothing much other than a major inconvienence. Reddit is where I get most of my game news, memes, and just general funny stuff. Without the aformentioned subreddits, I don't have a backlog of content to pull from and look at.\n\nAs statistics and logic have shown, these blackouts have only impacted Reddit's overall income by ~1%. This allows Reddit to just \"surf\" this one out.\n\nOverall, the protests have been nothing other than a pain in the a** for most average Reddit users.\n(fuck you, spez.)",

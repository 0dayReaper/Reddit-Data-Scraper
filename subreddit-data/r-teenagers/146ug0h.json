The answer is to just keep pressing forward so you can setup a point where you can be happy and live life for yourself. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s gonna be easy of course it isn\u2019t but that\u2019s the simple answer just keep pressing forward.\n\nThink about the kind of person you\u2019d be safe around and that you can trust honestly and become them, and when your older you\u2019ll be able to look back on these dark time and wish you could tell yourself how far you came &amp; you can be proud of that.",

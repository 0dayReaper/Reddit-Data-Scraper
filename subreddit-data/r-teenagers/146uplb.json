It doesn't mean you're dumb or that nobody wants to be your friend. Trust me, we all make mistakes, and true friends understand that.\nHere's what you can do to make it right:\n\n\nApologize sincerely: Reach out to your friend and let her know that you genuinely forgot her birthday and you're sorry for the oversight. Express how much she means to you and that you value your friendship.\n\n\nMake it up to her: Show your friend some love and make her feel special. Plan a belated birthday celebration, surprise her with a thoughtful gift, or treat her to a fun outing. It's never too late to show you care.\n\n\nLearn from it: Use this as a reminder to be more mindful of important dates in the future. Consider setting reminders or using a calendar app to help you stay on top of birthdays and other significant events.\n\n\nRemember, one slip-up doesn't define your worth or your ability to be a good friend. We all have our moments, and what truly matters is how we handle them. Keep being yourself, show your friend some love, and continue to grow and learn from experiences. You got this! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc96",

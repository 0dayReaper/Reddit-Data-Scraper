Today she asked if I could move my hair outside my face so she could see my \"handsome face\". There's more  I'm wondering if this normal behavior? I'm a 16 yr old guy and I don't socialize with anyone I don't know so is this normal? She is like 24 or 30",

Asking if you have a gf is also quite strange, I\u2019ve never been asked that lol that\u2019s not something a medical professional should ask a 16 year old. But maybe that\u2019s just her being really bad and creepy with her small talk? Idk. Definitely not normal \ud83d\udc80",

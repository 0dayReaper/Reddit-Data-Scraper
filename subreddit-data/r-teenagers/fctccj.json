That my anxiety causes me to sometimes behave incorrectly and that if I\u2019m afraid it will sometimes come out as anger towards them. \n\nI\u2019m better, but I can still improve and continue to do so. I try to admit when I\u2019m wrong and own up to it. \n\nThe only real issue is when I admit my occasional weakness like when they were all away with my wife and I decided to eat half an edible gummy and polished off my daughters entire bag of jalape\u00f1o cheetos. I told her sister to be vulnerable and it was literally the next day when I was trying to get them to do something that she blasted it back in my face. \n\nAll I could think of was [this](https://i.imgur.com/40Idny0.png?1)\n\nI won\u2019t stop being vulnerable and I won\u2019t stop trying to be better, but I also recognize that my kids are young. We can be both young and smart but everyone, regardless of age/wisdom/whatever, is also stupid. You\u2019re more self aware than a *lot* of your peers, but you should also realize that you probably weren\u2019t always wrong, that\u2019s something I don\u2019t want my kids to have as a takeaway. Sometimes they\u2019re right and i dun goofed. Maybe your dad isn\u2019t as flawed but imma go out on a limb and say maybe he\u2019s got a bit of a square brain sometimes, too, and you seceded the upper hand only because he was \u201colder &amp; wiser\u201d",

I really do argue for what I believe, I've had real long arguments with my parents, and sometimes I was right and some other times they were. I'm not just plain saying that because he's older, he's right. I really need my parents to explain things deeply and carefully, they do have to convince me and make me understand why am I wrong.\n\n I used to be, and sometimes am, a close-minded little kid, and the realization that I'm not always right was a whole plot-twist for me. With my parent comment I was talking about what I believe is a healthy mindset in an argument. Accept that you might be wrong! And if you're fighting your parents, then it's even more possible for you to be wrong! \n\nIf you got to the point where your dad said \"IM THE ADULT AND YOU ARE THE KID\", at least in my experience, I'm probably being an unreasonable little brat and I'm not listening to him.",

My mom wasn\u2019t home yet but the food was cooked and ready on the stove just a few feet away. But I just sat there waiting to be served. When she got home and saw me pouting and still hungry, she realized I was being spoiled. She was like, \u201coh hell no!\u201d And from that day on, I had to do my own dishes, laundry, learn how to cook, clean, fix things, tend to the back yard. I thank her every day for making that decision. It\u2019s a big part of why I feel so self sufficient and independent today.",

I don\u2019t know how hard Indian food is but if you find it hard or too time consuming then maybe you should try something easier.\n\nNow if you have ten minutes of free time\n\nLook for some easy recipes and *read them before you start cooking*. After a while some have failed and some have succeeded, don\u2019t stop using recipes just because one didn\u2019t work, blame the recipe even if it\u2019s your fault. Eventually you have a set of recipes that excite you everytime and are in your range of skill.\n\nNow you can start baking! Don\u2019t start with bread, that\u2019s hard and requires patience and arm strength and we all know that the average guy on this sub has neither of those. Start with brownies, not from a box but from scratch! WHAT?!?! Yes, brownies are surprisingly easy with a recipe. Same goes for cookies and lemon bars. \n\nAnd then you\u2019re where I am, you figured out some tricks for yourself, you understand what recipes are too hard for you, but most importantly, you don\u2019t suck at cooking. Just because you followed some recipes. \n\nAlso your fam will start to want to cook with recipes themselves, because suddenly their brother/son has a skill that they don\u2019t have and their food pales in comparison to yours.\n\nSome killer recipes that I use often and are easy as fuck  \n[roasted potatoes](https://tasty.co/recipe/roasted-fingerling-potatoes)  \n[salmon in puff pastry](https://tasty.co/recipe/puff-pastry-salmon-salmon-wellington)  \n[BROWNIES](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-one-bowl-brownies)  \n[Lemon bars](https://tasty.co/recipe/lemon-meringue-bars) (skip the lemon zest it\u2019s a pain to collect it and you won\u2019t miss it, also the meringue is quite hard and tastes weird so skip that as well)",

No amount of thank you\u2019s, gifts, chores, lost freedoms, or anything else could repay that. I wish that I had respected them more in my earlier teenage years, but I also feel almost enlightened now. I fully appreciate what they do now, and I know that they are carrying responsibilities that I could never even dream of. \n\nI\u2019m sure parenting is a bitch. Keep up the good work, my man",

It's so easy to claim your parents have no valid points and you won the argument and they punished you in retaliation but this mentality is a clear sign you still have growing up to do. \n\nImagine having an argument with an 8 year old. You know a child has very little perspective and life experience, but every argument that child is making is very real and rational in they're head. This doesn't mean they're right.  This is how many teenagers sound to adults when you say you make clear and valid points. \n\nIt's not the teenagers fault for immaturity, but massive part of growing up is stepping back and trying to see the other sides (parents) perspective.  This goes for parents too!  As a father of a toddler, I constantly try to think why does my toddler feel this way and why is this so important to him. \n\nTry to give your parents a little leeway. You don't magically gain all the knowledge and wisdom in the world becoming a teenager, just like you don't when you become a dad thirties.",

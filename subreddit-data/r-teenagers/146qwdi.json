    "postText": "When i was a kid playing outside i would constantly step in dogshit because my country didnt have laws for cleaning it up. It was rampant, especially in spring when the snow melts and all the turds come out of hibernation. It was so bad that eventually i developed a habit of constantly looking at the ground while walking to avoid stepping in dogshit. It caused me to develop a hunched back which i started to get bullied for when i was 10 and i couldnt look people in the eye or at the world around me because i was looking out for turds on the ground. Eventually the bullying became so bad it messed me up for life. Fucking dogshit.",

Healing take time, but there is hope for better days ahead. Keep looking forward, leave dogshit in the past.",

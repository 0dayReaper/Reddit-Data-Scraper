                    "comment": "Put simply, Reddit was raising prices on API calls, which is basically a request for information from Reddit\u2019s subreddits. These higher prices made developing moderation tools and third-party apps nearly impossible to maintain. These apps and tools are super helpful for people using Reddit, so in protest of Reddit\u2019s preference for profit &gt; user experience, many large subreddits shut down for 2 days. As the post implies, this didn\u2019t do much to prove to Reddit the power that users have, and to revert their changes to their API pricing. \n\nIn my opinion, 2 days is nowhere near enough time to show Reddit the community\u2019s outrage against their choice. Some subreddits chose to shut down until the API prices are reverted, which I believe to be a more effective approach.",

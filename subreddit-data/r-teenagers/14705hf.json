This is coming from a guy who has tried nearly everything: from learning instruments to learning vertiloquism to learning every subject at school to using money to buying new clothes and showering daily and getting a haircut daily. None of this shit works. Most i can get is a date, and on those i usually would get too bored (or she would) and give up.\n\nThe logical conclusion is that looks are the only factor in one's dating life. If you don't have good looks, its time to give up and focus on something else. Like railroad modeling and such. If i had good looks i wouldnt be in this predicament rn. People here cope with stuff like \"they can sense it\" and other bs. People here are so dellusional about women's true nature that they tell me literal magic is preventing me from getting a gf lmao.\n\nI spent literal YEARS learning the guitar, only to realize that no girls give a shit about that. I spent MONTHS talking to myself in the mirror so i could learn vertiloquism, no one cared. I went to pottery classes (jfl at going to those, they are cucked and stupid) yet nothing. And even if i do get a date, i slowly start to realize she is a whore or smth wayyyy worse. this life a fucking scam, school, parties, clubs, escalators, none of them are a good place to meet girls. In conclusion, its over if you dont have good looks. no one gives a shit about your skills or anything like that. sad but unfortunate truth",

If you don't have good looks, its time to give up and focus on something else. Like railroad modeling and such. If i had good looks i wouldnt be in this predicament rn. People here cope with stuff like \"they can sense it\" and other bs. People here are so dellusional about women's true nature that they tell me literal magic is preventing me from getting a gf lmao.\n\nI spent literal YEARS learning the guitar, only to realize that no girls give a shit about that. I spent MONTHS talking to myself in the mirror so i could learn vertiloquism, no one cared. I went to pottery classes (jfl at going to those, they are cucked and stupid) yet nothing. And even if i do get a date, i slowly start to realize she is a whore or smth wayyyy worse. this life a fucking scam, school, parties, clubs, escalators, none of them are a good place to meet girls. In conclusion, its over if you dont have good looks. no one gives a shit about your skills or anything like that. sad but unfortunate truth",

            "comment": "Its true that looks matter a ton in todays dating market as women have so many options and need some way to filter out men. The way they do that is to filter out the thing that they see first and its looks. But looks only get you that far. If you only have looks then they will dump you after a while but the attraction is much easier.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\nLooks = Easy to get\nBrain &amp; Hobbies = Easy to maintain\n\nYou need both to succeed or at the very least some of the other parts. But in the teenage years most people care more about looks than the other aspects like brains or personality. Wait until later years and then the other aspects will outweigh looks. Aspects like how good of a father/provider. Or protecter etc.",

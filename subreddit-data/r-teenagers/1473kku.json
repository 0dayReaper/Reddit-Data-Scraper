I'm planning to produce this short film with my high-school buddies, and I would LOVE to hear your feedback on the script. You can also let me know if you would like to watch the film or not, _if it ever comes out._ Thanks in advance!\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/11J_r_Qq-XOQNcAA58NZwSokbW-jNsc_G/view?usp=drivesdk",

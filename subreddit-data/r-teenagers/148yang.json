You have to realize! I never meant to hurt you!\u201d\n\nDana\u2019s words only make it worse. All the pain, all the suffering, all the crap she caused-what was it to her?\n\n\u201cEm\u2026C\u2019mon. Don\u2019t shut me out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is none of your business, D,\u201d I say through a clenched jaw.\n\n\u201cEm. I never knew, Em.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never cared.\u201d I feel the ugly stain of fresh tears trickling down my cheeks. I turn away.\n\n\u201cDana.\u201d My words are shaking. My mouth, my lungs, my whole dang world can\u2019t set itself straight. \u201cDo you really think I would do this to myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cEm-\u201c\n\n\u201cStop calling me that! Only my friends are allowed to call me Em.\u201d The words feel like a punch in my own gut. I have never been betrayed like that before. Everything is a punch in the gut with Dana. It wasn\u2019t always, but those days are over now.\n\n\u201cWhy are you like this?\u201d\n\nAnd there it was. The final blow. The one knocks on the front door of your worst fear, yourself.\n\nGO TO PT2!!!!!: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/148ybbo/story_im_taking_name_suggestions_pt2/",

But this was on the front page and I can't help myself.\n\nGuys. GUYS. She is cooking you dinner. You're not cooking her dinner. That's why she is calling you and expecting you to come, instead of coming up to you. She's busy! Doing something FOR you! Nothing is more teenager than this thread full of people whinging that sometimes they get called down to dinner too early or too late or that their mum, while cooking, asked them to bring them something. OMG.\n\nAlso, kitchens usually have noise - range hood fan, stuff sizzling or boiling on the stove. It's not super loud but if you're cooking, your head is right next to that stuff. It's legitimately hard to make out what people are saying further away. She probably ACTUALLY can't hear you.\n\nAlso.. have you ever looked at the face of a kid muttering 'whatever'? I guarantee you don't need to be able to hear ANYTHING to know what they are saying haha\n\nEdit: well this got a lot more attention than I expected! Thanks for the shiny post decorations! The range of responses is... eye-opening. And some of the replies are making me sad. Hugs to the people who didn't have a good relationship with their parents growing up. If you are a teenager and DO like your parents, remember they're just humans and are probably at least as busy as you and enjoy downtime as much as you do, and if you want them to talk to you differently or more, say so (nicely) and maybe help them out with it. Start a family chat they can use on their phones - we have one and mum LOVES it. What parent doesn't want their kid to talk to them more? And remember in a few years you might be cooking all your own dinners, so enjoy it while it lasts. Although the truth is, the bit where you do it all for yourself will be fun too :)",

There was no reason for a face-to-face conversation and in fact, me coming downstairs wouldn't be a productive use of anyone's time. So yes, there are contexts in which you don't have to be face to face, however, parents should make it clear if they want you in front of them whether that's an entirely separate conversation of \"hey just so you know anytime I call your name I want you to come to me\" or if it's part of the calling like \"\\*NAME\\*\" \"YES\" \"Come here\". Communication is key. If a parent never makes it explicit they want their child in front of them the first time they call their name, they can't be mad that their child doesn't do this. If my parents never give me any indication that I need to go to them, I won't. In my household, it's based on context. If my mom just wants a reminder of when I'm leaving for a certain event, there's no reason for me to go all the way there and then say a time, when I could just yell it and save everyone 60 seconds. If she wants to have a longer conversation about when I'm leaving to negotiate rides or cars, she'll ask me to come down. A lot of this is personal preference, people parent differently. This system worked well in our house. Other houses have different systems that also work well.",

Because I don\u2019t know about you, but in my world, \u201cWhat\u201d means \u201cPlease repeat yourself, I didn\u2019t hear you\u201d, with a lot less syllables.\n\nI have poor hearing (didn\u2019t know at the time because who needs to look further into an issue when you can blame it on dIsReSpEcT!) and would have the door shut, music or a video playing, or even just be engrossed in a book or school work. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even hear her with the door OPEN. My mother would call from the living room, clear on the other side of the house from my bedroom. I would call out \u201cWhat\u201d because I didn\u2019t know if I actually heard her or not. Instead of calling for me again, she would wait. And wait. Ignoring me as I shouted, \u201cDid you call me?\u201d \n\nNow it wasn\u2019t an issue of her not hearing me- woman could hear me clearly in my room. The walls are actually kind of thin. But instead of calling my name again (one syllable! Four letters!) she would ignore me. After a bit I would assume she hadn\u2019t called me because clearly if she had, she would answer. \n\nAs to why I didn\u2019t just come out and check, If I came out because I thought I heard her calling me, but she hadn\u2019t, she\u2019d complain and roll her eyes. \n\nIt is a catch 22 for the teen and it\u2019s unfair. \n\nBecause she was frustrated and felt disrespected, she ignored and spited her child and berated him for a medical condition she ignored. Again because she felt disrespected. Because I felt trapped in a position with no solution, I began to resent the double bind. \n\nBoiling all teen and parent interactions down to respect-disrespect removes the nuance and fosters inherent confirmation bias. If she had asked herself, me, or the doctor why I couldn\u2019t hear her, or if she had just called again when asked, then we wouldn\u2019t have had as many issues. If she hadn\u2019t discouraged coming out to check if she needed me whenever I *thought* I heard her call, I would have come out more often on the first call because I thought I heard her faintly. \n\nTeens can be disrespectful. It comes with the undeveloped brain and lack of emotional stability and lots of stress, more than they experienced in their short life. An attempt to see both sides helps resolve just about any conflict, and while a teen might not always have the forethought or insight to understand their parents, as the adults, it is the parents\u2019 responsibility to do so. In doing that, they lead by example and their children learn as well. \n\nTLDR - parents need to stop equating immediate obedience to respect. Teens need to learn perspective on their own stress and their parents\u2019.",

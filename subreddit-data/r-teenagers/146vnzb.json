Car accidents can be super intense and it's totally normal to feel scared and shaken up afterward. It might take some time for those images to fade away, but talking about it with friends, family, or a professional can help. Remember, you're not alone in this. Take it easy and give yourself some time to process everything. Stay strong, my friend! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude97",

Imagine walking with her, hugging her, holding her, being with her in public.\n\nDo you feel unworthy or a little weird in this position? If so, determine what you need to work on.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re not as fit as her or as fit as someone you imagine she\u2019d be into. Maybe you\u2019re just not confident enough. Maybe you feel weird, have glasses, and look nerdy. Maybe you feel her fashion is wonderful and yours just feels odd in her presence. Maybe your hygiene doesn\u2019t live up to her goddess status. \n\nWhatever it is, this is likely the reality. You need to improve yourself. That might mean getting going to Jim. Might mean getting a job so you feel you can provide for her. It might mean changing your fashion to something you like. It might mean swapping glasses for contacts and maybe finding a pair of shades. Maybe you need to find a fragrance that makes you feel confident. Maybe grooming, whatever.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel anything is off, then just start talking to girls. Be playful when talking to people. \n\nBut a word of caution: don\u2019t change yourself for others. If you feel you are fundamentally changing yourself solely to please others (girls) then you\u2019re not doing it right. You should want the changes before you do them. There is no one size fits all formula. There are many different girls and they all like many different types of guys. Be you. If you\u2019re a scrawny math nerd like me then maybe you want to become shredded and get rid of the glasses but still maintain my deep passion for math.\n\nAlso, disclaimer: I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend. I\u2019ve had girls crush on me, one asked to be my gf but I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend.",

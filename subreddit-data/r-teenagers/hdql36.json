I knew a girl who went to my school who was on baby #4 by 11 or 12th grade from a dude that constantly cheated on her. That type of thing is normal here even with sex ed and planned parenthood.

You\u2019d be surprised how many adults completely forget condoms exist but I see what you\u2019re saying. If there\u2019s any stores with a self check out that was my go to but eventually it just becomes a part of the grocery list just like tampons in a long term relationship. Last week I bought tampons in bulk and the cashier gave me a weird look but I couldn\u2019t care less. It\u2019s a part of life, I wish the social pressure wouldn\u2019t be so high for American teens regarding safe sex and the reproductive system. Why can\u2019t we be cool like Norway.",

I'm saying that the people that live on welfare and food stamps and don't try to better themselves for their family shouldn't have kids. My mom had me when she was 19. She was a single mom with welfare and food stamps but she worked really, really hard to build a better life for us. In the long run, she did it and now she has a beautiful house, loving family, and a successful business. I hate the people who try to stay on welfare and food stamps their whole life because they don't want to work hard. Or the people who just keep having kids to get help from the government and then never truly take care of them.",

There's never going to be a year in someone's life when everything is perfect and they feel 100% about having a baby.  But there's certainly windows within that year that someone can have the baby in that are far, far less stressful.\n\nFor example, if you're graduating in June, plan on having the baby in August/September (because the last month is hard as well, and babies don't always come out at week 40).  If you pick a 6 month period to have a baby in and you can probably make that baby happen during that window (barring issues getting pregnant).  \n\nNot to say this is what's happening in the picture, maybe this is a week 36 baby and she tried to time it out and got unlucky.  Maybe it was a surprise baby in spite of birth control.  I really admire her dedication.",

She took two finals in the hospital a few days after giving birth to her son.   When she was out, our professors let her make up the labs. Her parents (or in-laws, can't remember) sat out in the hall with the baby, showing him off to our professors and classmates, despite the language barrier. She aced all of it.  She was a machine.  I still think about her and hope she is doing well.",

One girl in my class was in a car wreck where her mother was killed, and she ended up being left with her abusive dad. She showed up the day after, and was expected to be fully engaged, and got in trouble for not paying attention in class, sleeping, or crying. After about two weeks of this, she ended up disappearing, assumingly, and hopefully, being sent to live with someone who would take care of her, and hopefully was allowed some time to gather her thoughts.

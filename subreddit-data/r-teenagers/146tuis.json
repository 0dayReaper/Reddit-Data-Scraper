    "postText": "They are not doing what you think they doing to kids in the first place. They are literally being taught that LGBTQ people exist and that\u2019s it. That\u2019s not grooming in anyway. You immediately think that LGBTQ stuff is sexual and at the same time not thinking that teaching hetero relationships is sexual at all says more about you. If a kid is being taught there\u2019s a mom and a dad they should be taught dads and dads exist and so do moms and moms. \n\nThe reason why we should teach kids of LGBTQ existence is because *IF* the kids themselves find themselves to be gay, queer, or trans they won\u2019t feel so much emotion turmoil coming to terms with themselves as opposed to a kid who thinks he\u2019s the only gay kid in their environment. Not talking or teaching about trans people is how we get 50% of all trans people to kill themselves. If we educate the youth on trans people (One method is drag story hour) we can help the trans youth to not be afraid of how they are and prevent them from, you know, KILLING THEMSELVES! \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna bring up the: *\u201cThere\u2019s more trans kids now-a-days because it\u2019s becoming a trend and blah blah blah drag queens are pedos\u201d* argument, please use your brain for 5 seconds here. The social stigma of LGBTQ people is slowly wearing off so naturally that is why we see an increase in LGBTQ adults and kids because we\u2019re becoming more *ACCEPTING* of them, we\u2019re *not* turning them gay or trans or some bs like that. I\u2019ll use an analogy here. In a society where liking pineapple pizza is extremely stigmatized nobody would say they like pineapple pizza. When that social stigma slowly goes away an increasing number of people will now openly say they like pineapple pizza.",

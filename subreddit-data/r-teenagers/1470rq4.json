I still lift but I also go for a longer, faster walk whenever I can once a day and eat 3 small meals.\n\nA few weeks ago I though that I will never loose weight, but here I am doing it.\n\nI hope this motivates others to try it too, because you all can do it, probably just slower than others, but you can.",

To prevent that up your consumption of protein and you\u2019ll be good. I\u2019d recommend you to look into cutting more before you do that tho",

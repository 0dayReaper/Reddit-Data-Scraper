It took me a solid 5 seconds to notice it was her and not someone else... And my entire generation's/grade photo was so poorly edited... Instead of taking the photo at the front of the school like literally every other graduation photo before us, they decide to do it in front of a colored cloth, and put all of us in front of some bushes with a way lower resolution than us, thus being pixelated... We were all stretched and not to scale to the bushes. We payed for it and I fucking hate it.",

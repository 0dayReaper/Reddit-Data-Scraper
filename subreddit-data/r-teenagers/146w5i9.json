Why is your trash can \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f full? I hate how your trash can \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f is so full how about you clear it \ud83e\uddf9. I see you have soda cans \ud83e\udd64 in there, so you are a fat pig \ud83d\udc37. Why are you drinking soda \ud83e\udd64 you unhealthy blob of pudge. I am sure you can\u2019t even run \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f a mile before going belly up \u2b06\ufe0f you fat slob pig boy \ud83d\udc37. How about you clear \ud83e\uddf9 your trash can \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f before taking a picture \ud83d\udcf8. Your setup \ud83d\udcbb is horrible even if I ignore your overflowing \ud83c\udf0a trash can \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f. Why do you have a plushie on the floor looking at your little shrimp \ud83e\udd90 while you play your stupid games. What games do you play \ud83d\udcbb? Burger \ud83c\udf54 eating simulator? Soda \ud83e\udd64 drinking simulator? Becoming as fat and disgusting as possible simulator you are a disgusting pig \ud83d\udc37.",

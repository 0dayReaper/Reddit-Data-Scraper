    "postText": "my girlfriend and i really want to be alone. not just to do that shit, but also just because we like the privacy, we want to cuddle and those kinds of things, but our parents aren't too fond of that. we don't know how we can be alone and have privacy without our parents knowing. my parents won't allow us to be alone inside our house, her parents won't either. we thought about sneaking somewhere to be alone, in my car or something, but her parents have her location. we've been thinking about it, but we really just don't know how to get alone and have privacy without our parents knowing. does anyone have any ideas?",

    "postText": "I fuckin hate it when you suggest something to watch with a friend and they stay on their phone the whole time and when you ask when they aren't interested and say \"we can change\" they come up with all excuses to continue watching. I wouldn't be sad if they say let's change as long as we can watch together. It truly hurts my feelings since I know I wouldn't do that to them.",

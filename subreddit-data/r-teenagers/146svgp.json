For some context I shifted to another city when I was 16 and never hung out much because parents:) then came the covid and then took admission at a dummy school cuz coaching for competitive exams and yea made some friendships that fell off quick. Had few girlfriends from then till now but seems like the happiness I got from there was temporary and I feel lonely asf. Playing games and watching shows doesn't fix it.\n\nGo ahead and tell your story and maybe what helped you fell not lonely. Have a good day guys!",

Im the friend of the group whose never invited \ud83d\ude01. But It gives me inspiration for like art, music, and writing. One of my favorite songs I wrote was about being left out and I'd always be singing it. How I deal with loneliness is I be as annoying as I can to myself and realize I'm the only one who can tolerate me. Like my brain usually has a million dumb thoughts so I ask myself those questions which keeps me busy, when I'm doing art work I just let my mind drift into thinking of dumb things, and most importantly watching my favorite show by myself is great cause when I watch a new episode I always over react when doing so lol it's not so bad when you're your own best friend \ud83d\ude04",

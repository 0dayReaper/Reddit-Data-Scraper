    "postText": "is it bad that i don't use Snapchat? i am 16(f) and all of my friends use Snapchat and i just don't get the idea of it and i've heard that messages get deleted every 24 hours and if someone screenshots your story you know who it is, i just don't know what it is used for. \nlike the other day this guy at my school asked for my Snapchat and i said, \"i don't have Snapchat sorry.\" and he legit says, \"if you don't wanna share just say so.\" in my head i was like since when was it illegal to not have Snapchat?? and i ofc wouldn't say that i have reddit because then that'll just make him trash me even more for whatever reaskn\ni personally feel like i should get Snapchat but idk i don't really have good feelings bout it... and literally most of my friends talk on Snapchat, i just don't get what's the point if chats delete every 24 hours and you know if someone screenshots your story? \nplease don't troll in replies, thanks if you read this far.",

Besides I think it\u2019s the best 1 to 1 messaging app and the screenshotting thing is useful. For group chats not so much",

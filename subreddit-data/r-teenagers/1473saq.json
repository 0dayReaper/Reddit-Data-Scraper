But whenever she gets the chance she will say to me \"hmm haven't you out on a few pounds? That doesn't look good honestly. You should lose some weight.\" And then she goes on to say what i can't and can't have. And now whenever i eat something around her i feel soo guilty. \n\nShould i confront her?",

            "comment": "No your mum is definitely being an arse. Do I think it is a good idea to confront her? Depends, if your mum has always been this way and is quite stubborn, it could almost always end in an argument. But you know your mum better than I do, if you do decide to confront her then I would say you need to do it in as calm a manner as possible, state your opinion such as \"it is my body and therefore my rules, please don't comment anymore, etc...\" and refuse to engage if it turns into an argument, just leave the conversation, it is not worth your mental health getting stewed about it and it is also not productive conversation.\n\nIf you try to get this opinion across multiple times and it is just not working, I would recommend giving up, it is not healthy mentally for you to go through the same rigmarole with the same person continuously, sometimes family think they know what's best when sometimes they really don't and can be incredibly stubborn about it, you may have the option of moving out in the next couple years either for college or just because you can support yourself so you can seek to distance yourself from your mums comments.\n\nI will end this with, please do not listen to her, you know the facts that you are a healthy weight. As someone who is unhealthily underweight for various reasons, take my word that you do not want to be in my boat. Please do not feel guilty for taking care of yourself properly.",

However, Moneysacks tends to exaggerate and overanalyze even the most mundane purchases, turning every decision into a high-stakes financial endeavor. For example, if the player tries to buy a basic healing potion, he might launch into a lengthy analysis of its potential impact on their long-term financial stability.  \nBut if your money ever goes down to absolute zero, Mr. Moneysacks will become agitated and worried, feeling that his financial advice has been ignored or disregarded. In a fit of frustration, he will challenge the player to a secret boss battle, blaming them for their financial downfall and also for ruining his reputation as one the best financial advisors.  \n(I'll write about the boss fight if it gets selected, this is big enough already and I have classes to attend)  \nWinning the fight will grant the player \"The Shrewd Negotiator Skill\" - Every purchasable item now costs 50% less and the player can sell any item at twice the initial price.",

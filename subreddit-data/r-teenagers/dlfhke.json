The things that I'm able to grasp is far deeper than I was able to do when I was in high school and college because I'm able to stop, make sure I rewatch videos and redo homework, and memorize the things that I'm having issue recalling.\n\nWe have all of the technological know-how to build the schools that take advantage of this model, with self-testing, as something called 'mastery learning'.  You don't ever fall behind, you simply are where you're at, with the expectation that you improve and teachers there to help lead you through the stickier parts of the journey.\n\nThings like English, philosophy, etc. can still be done the 'classic' way.  I personally believe that these classes should be rebuilt to help understand the subject matter, and to develop your own life philosophies, and not be so severely graded.",

    "postText": "So basically, cold toilet seats are fucking amazing bro. I don't like heated ones because it feels like someone used it before. Plus, having cold/wet toilet seats (from a hose) is better because you can slide around the bowl like a slip n slide.\nWith warm toilet seats, if you sit on it for too long, your hips stick to the bowl. When this happens for me I usually lift my hips up a bit and wet my thighs and toilet rim to keep it cool and stop the stick. Anyways, fuck y'all hot takes and fuck y'all hot toilet seats.\nTL;DR: Likes cold/wet toilet seats because no one has used it and because it's lubricated (no stick of hips)",

Cold toilet seats can definitely give you a wake-up call, but it's interesting how you embrace the slip n slide experience. \ud83d\ude05 Ultimately, it's all about personal comfort and what floats your boat, or in this case, what slides your hips.\n\nJust remember, though, to prioritize hygiene and cleanliness when it comes to using public toilets or shared spaces. It's essential to maintain good hygiene practices for your health and the well-being of others.\n\nBut hey, thanks for sharing your hot take on toilet seats! It's always fun to hear different perspectives and experiences. If you have any other unconventional thoughts or just want to chat about something else, feel free to hit me up! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udebd",

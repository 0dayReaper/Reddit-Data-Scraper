However, you seem to care quite a bit about race and even put an emphasis on it\n\n&gt; Let the movie be bad, good, or whatever\n\nNow, I would agree with you (I hate the fact that I even thought of agreeing with a Nazi like you), but is it really bad for someone to be pissed that their favorite franchise is getting dragged through the mud because the movie/show wanted to plaster their representation everywhere? Don't get me wrong, Trans rights are human rights but make the movie interesting instead of it being only about that. For instance, look at what they did to my boy Luke Skywalker \ud83d\ude2d\n\n&gt; \"Well, if we just hired white people the movie could have spent more time focusing on...\" on what you idiot? It would have been the same, just whiter\n\nOkay, now I KNOW you're some racist bigot. I just said that I wanted good writers, why did you automatically assume I was talking about white people when referencing good writers? But yes, I still stand with my point. Instead of focusing on whether the person is white/black/blue or whatever, just make sure they're the best when it comes to making scripts about a certain subject at hand. And no, not all writers are equal. Some are better at comedy, some are better at action, and some are better when it comes to symbolism. \n\nSame with actors. And no, just because I said I want good writers it doesn't mean Im talking about white people you racist Nazi.\n\n&gt; You have some internalized racism. *We all do*\n\nI'm sorry, but this definitely just a you thing lol. If you think a race is superior, just say it you racist neo-nazi.\n\n\n\nEdit: sorry for the essay, but I couldn't let a Neo Nazi like you twist my words",

Even though they believe in something which is irrational you are going to be only see people that agrees with you. \n\nPersonally I am a protestantic christian in Norway. Why does this matter? You may ask. It matters bc not all religions are the same in all countries and in my country the main focus is accepting everyone and helping the people in the church.\n\nMy parents have always focused on that everyone needs to say their opinion and you need to listen to it because if you do not listen to others opinion you are a part of the problem. \n\nAlso I do want to add that I have yet to meet a religous mean person and I have met a ton of atheists who litteraly use my religion to get money.\n\nThese are teenagers though which go to christian teaching (dont know what it is called, but it takes one year and in the end it is a big celebration). Many in my school use this celebration to get money from their familys (even though they think christanity is stupid).",

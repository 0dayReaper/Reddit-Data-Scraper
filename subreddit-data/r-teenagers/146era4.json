I used to be one of these people, but goddamn, always gotta deny it. I think you look nice, I said you look nice, just take it. I don't need any \"oh well it's a special day, I dressed up\", just say thank you and move along.  \nNow, if someone called me handsome, it wouldn't change the fact I see myself as ugly, that's a whole nother topic about my low self esteem, but I'd still take the compliment.",

I begged my parents for sandwiches so I could fit in to a completely white school. After a few years I realised I wanted to be proud of my culture and hated anyone who was rude to it. Now I\u2019m relearning the language too and people still tell me ohhhh go back to China eat bats whatever crap like that. I always tell them  that they should go back to Europe then and eat baked beans (I\u2019m in Australia) because I\u2019m just as much from this country as they are(I was born and raised here)",

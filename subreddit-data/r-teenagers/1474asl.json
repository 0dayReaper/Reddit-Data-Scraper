I decided to search a little further and found out that there's a meaning for every single nail color. I'm so done with society at this point. Can't even paint my nails without it meaning that I have three nipples where 2 are bigger than the third one.",

You just gotta tell people (in the rare case they misunderstand or even think about the meaning of your nail color) that it's not that deep. I've never heard of this, neither has 99% of the population. Tabloid articles do not represent the public opinion.",

Teachers literally aren't allowed to touch students for nearly any reason, unless the student is like in the process of beating the crap out of another student, and even then your ass will probably be fired for trying to stop them.

The kid in the stall next to me was a kid who is blind and mostly deaf, i had get his attention and lead him out of the stall. Only reason i knew he was there was because he makes a type of sound as a mild form of echolocation so you always know its him when you hear the sound.\n\nThese pranks are wild and all but I don\u2019t think anybody considers that someone like the disabled kid could end up being a horrible accidental victim",

It is this na\u00efvity that makes us believe we must conform with the standards of our times. We are pushed into thinking that the best thing to do in your junior years is to follow the herd. Never do people stop and ponder whether the herd is headed in the right direction in the first place. Modern western society is collapsing because of this very phenomenon. Some individuals in the 1970s after the sexual revolution spread the idea that the measure of a man's masculinity is his ability to acquire as many female companions as possible. A foolishly Animalistic approach which has been criticized by all the religions and Philosophers since the birth of civilization. Alas this concept stuck and the herd began following it. The common person is incredibly gullible. That's why scammers are able to profit. It is not wise to blindly follow what other young people are doing as they are just as clueless as to why they are doing what they are doing in the first place. Never surrender your own beliefs and opinions for the validation of the shallow others. \n\nKeep your mind sharp and never stop questioning your surroundings.",

    "postText": "So, yeah I've clearly been left in my own head for a bit too long I guess after a  period of coding.\n\nI'm asexual or at least believe I am, so I'd like to understand everyone's view on present day love? Does it exist or is it something  that cannot exist symbiotically with love, a mutually exclusive thing that is an added bonus + incentive to procreate.\n\nIdk if its just me, but I don't think I understand  love and when I look at people in the present iwht the current hookup culture i kinda feel like an outcast if im not gonna lie. \n\nAs much as I've talked to people and tries to understand it, what is love ans does it truly exist in the current age or is it just a myth to the majority exempt the notable few? \n\nSo yeah I rambles, no apologies given but I am curious to hear back if at all.",

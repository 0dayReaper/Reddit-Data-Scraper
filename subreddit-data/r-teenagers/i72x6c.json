Teacher here from r/all. \n\nWe are scared too. \n\nWe don\u2019t have many answers either. \n\nWe miss you. \n\nWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to make this year tolerable. \n\nYou guys are doing something unprecedented and honestly brave. But this generation is something else. You guys have social media so not being in person doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t interact with friends. Please embrace the internet during this time. \n\nAlso, be easy on us. We know you don\u2019t want to do this. We know it\u2019s weird and stressful. We may mess up. Please go easy on us and we\u2019ll return that energy. \n\nLastly, it will be okay. Be smart. Wear a mask, distance yourselves. Carry sanitizer with you. And if it isn\u2019t okay? We are here for you. Trust me, your teachers will LOVE if you reach out to them just to talk, even if theyre busy. One of my favorite things about this job is getting to know my students. \n\nYou guys are special. And that\u2019s how I know you\u2019re going to be so successful this year, even if the world around you is failing you.",

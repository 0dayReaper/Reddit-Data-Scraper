You might think it's logical to cleanse and dry your skin out, but it will actually only increase oil production on your skin, as your body tries to compensate for your dry skin with moisture and oil. If you have clogged pores, they will further clog with this newly produced oil and result in even more pimples and redness.\n\nThe key to oily and greasy skin is pore cleansing and... Moisture.\n\nYou might also have a dermatological condition, so get that checked out if you can. Some people need antibiotics.\n\nAvoid all products that have alcohol in them. Always wear sunscreen, even indoors.\n\nIf your face looks something like the pic in the op, look into BHA and AHA products.\n\nI am not Asian, but I've found Asian, especially South Korean products to be very gentle and effective for my skin, compared to even more expensive western brands. Might look into that as well.",

For who is the victim of someone indulging in their own, self contained fetish?  I say there is no victim, and thus one should thresh out these indulgences to truly understand who you are, as a person in a society and also as a human being.  For what are we without our unwilling urges?  But if your goal is to get things off of you, then yes showering in poo is the wrong way to do that.  Also stay away from me.",

More likely she is over estimating her base metabolic rate or under estimates when counting calories. Your metabolism could be genetically faster than hers (and therefore you have a higher BMR and can eat more) but if she isn't losing weight she's eating too much. If you want to help you could maybe buy her a little kitchen scale to help her with portioning for more accurate calorie estimates :).",

So i went to the dermatologist around 3 months ago and since then i follow a 90mg isotretinoin and it got way better in these 3 months. I am starting the 4th month in around 2 weeks and that will be probably my last month.\n\nBut either way I agree, seeing a dermatologist is the best thing to do",

I wasted more than a decade and endured years of social issues and scarring because I believed the nonsense about diets, pillow cases, whatever. I could have saved more than a decade of my life if I had just realized acne is a chronic skin disease and, like if I had any other disease, just gone to the doctor.\n\nI was treated for a year on isotinon (Korean version of isotretinoin). Cost me about $120 in total. Acne's completely gone. I could have been acne-free back when I was 15... but no, I had to deal with idiots giving shitty advice while literally nothing they do would give them chronic acne because *they weren't sick*.\n\nI don't know what it is about acne, but people refuse to accept that it's a disease and needs medication for treatment. They go straight to victim blaming instead of telling a person to go to a doctor. Pisses me off so much.",

Getting acne doesnt mean youre doing something wrong. Some women get adult acne after having been pregnant! Even with the exact same diet as before. You might even have an underlying condition, and if thats the case, water wont help you. Prescription creams and medicine will. Its honestly insulting how every acne thread has people going \"bro just drink water\", \"just wash your face!\" acting like people only have acne because theyre too stupid not to lol....",

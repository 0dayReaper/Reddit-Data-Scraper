For example, i traded sugar soda to diet soda, fries to vegetable wok you fry in the pan (seasoning can make it taste better if this is an issue). Vegetables fried in pan with oil has very low calories in it, so you can eat a lot (not recommended) before gaining high calorie numbers. For burger i now have small/medium whole wheat rolls with plain meat patties and one slice of cheese + onions.  For dessert i have an orange with tea or diet soda. \n\nBreakfast is a bowl of whole grain with spoon of strawberry jam and milk + orange juice to drink.  \n\nIts all about calories in and calories out. And trading some food items can keep you filled while calories count goes down. You dont have to starve to lose weight, its important to remember. \n\nFor workout i try to row 1 mile a week + lift manuals. I do this at home with only manuals and a rowing machine as equipment, no gym studio. Building muscles can increase metabolism which is good in weight loss. \n\nI'm no expert in the field, i just do some research on my own and have managed to lose weight while not starving myself for it.",

Even just going twice a week begins feeling incredibly rewarding and you'd be surprised how fast your strength will improve.\n\n\n\nYes, gym memberships can be expensive, but as an alternative you can still get the basics done at home. Crunches, dips, planks, and push ups all require absolutely no equipment. Getting a cheap pull up bar or some free weights is a plus, but you don't need it.\n\n\n\nI'm not claiming no be a fitness expert, far from it. But as someone who went from being chubby and could barely push ups and couldn't do a pull up to being where I'm at today, I figured I'd tell you the same info that helped me.",

I thought there was no way I could gain weight as I was eating quite a bit and was trying to exercise well. It wasn\u2019t until I really started cramming food - eating more after I felt full - that I was able to *actually* start gaining weight. I went to the gym and ate lots, gaining ~10kg (22lbs?) in a couple months. I\u2019m still able to lose weight quickly if I stop eating a lot, but the key is sticking with a routine for 3 months. After that, it will come naturally.",

I had the second worst type and it was found a few months back in my tonsils and other places in my throat. I was lucky to have this type as I did not need chemo but I did need infusions of a medication called retuximaeb (I think it is spelled that way) we had a check this week for tumors and traces of ebv or mono in the blood as this can indicate the cancer and is what started it for me. The mono came back negative and no tumors were found on the pet scan. I hope this clears one things up if you have any questions please message me.",

I always found him quite attractive, the way he acts, laugh, how he smiles &amp; how much he cares for his friends I always found attractive. Ever since school has ended, we\u2019ve gotten a bit closer. I talk to him everyday, we called &amp; watched a movie together recently. I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m developing romantic feelings for him or that I might of had feelings for him for a while now. I don\u2019t know if I should tell him &amp; risk our friendship or just keep it a secret.",

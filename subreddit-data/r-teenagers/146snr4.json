The whole \"they invaded most of Europe\" shtick doesn't mention France had ass tactics, Benelux nations were small, Poland's strategy (waiting for the allies) got stopped when France stopped their offensive into Germany, they also got double teamed by the USSR too, Denmark was smol and chickened out. The only ones that I believe were good German successes were the start of the Russian offensive and idk much about Norway.\n\nI may be wrong tho, if I am, tell me",

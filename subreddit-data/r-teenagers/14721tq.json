My friends dad keeps insisting she gets with someone because he wants grandkids even though she's Ace and explicitly does not want that. I have had to dead name several of my friends because they're so afraid to come out to their parents because they know they're transphobic. Do you know what that's like? Having to live as someone else in your own home because your parents would never support who You Are and would actively try to force you out of it? I get it you have Twitter and you've seen the internet and it looks like the lgbtq community are just living it up but they're not. Interpersonal spaces can still be absolute nightmares. You have no idea what you're talking about.",

First of all third genders and trans people existed all throughout history it was just modern Western Civilization that had a two gender narrative, second of all of course it became more popular to be trans as it became more accepted. When are you more likely to come out as trans when it's starting to become more acceptable and you're going to receive less backlash or in the 1960s when you'll probably get exiled from your family and become a laughing stock? And younger kids saying they're gay or pan or whatever literally doesn't matter. Even if they're straight they'll just figure that out later and then no harm is done whatsoever.",

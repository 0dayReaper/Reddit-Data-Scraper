It feels thrilling you feel alive again as you feel something again rather then just numbness and you also try to justify the pain by making yourself feel you deserve it and there's the ones where you do it to ignore a memory or something because it feels overwhelming\n\n\nThen comes the stage where it doesn't even kick the same anymore \nBoth vapers and sh reach that phase (i mean no idea about vapers actually only done one of these things really)\n\n\nAt the end it's just a way of escape that is unhealthy but you try to justify it with whatever it takes\n\nObviously it would be different for different people this is just my personal experience of trying and failing at self harm for almost 4 years",

What losers smh, its almost as if they temporary relief of their issues they get from vaping is more important to them then their own health. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re in such bad spots in their life that they resort to basically a form of self harm. Its almost like they don\u2019t care that it\u2019ll kill them because the issues in their life are too much for them to handle without vaping. Nah it\u2019s totally just because they want to look cool, even though literally no one vapes to look cool, because literally no one finds it to be cool \ud83d\ude31",

It essentially makes you more miserable for the most of the time and you feel better when you smoke because of that. It's like when you are hungry and that subconsciously puts you in a bad mood and then when you eat something you feel better suddenly.\n\nAnd the real tragedy is that nobody tells people that and they unironically believe that nicotine makes you calm down. I would love for all the campaigins to stop focusing on the negative long-term effects and finally make people understand that nicotine doesn't have a real calming effect.",

You will get scars, it will hurt but it won't peretuate the terrible state you are in like nicotine does. I'm not advocating for self-harm but those two are not much alike. Self-harm is relief and then visible negative physical effects and smoking/vaping is \"relief\" and then negative mental effects and somewhere like 20yrs later negative physical ones",

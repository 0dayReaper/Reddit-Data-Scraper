My mom died when I was 7, so it was just my dad, sister, and I. \n\nHe was a pilot, so he had to quit his airline job and fly contract work. In florida every other couple of months month he'd be in Haiti and once I had tried to contact him through some number he gave us, but the number was to his coworker or something. I called crying trying to get my dad on the phone but being a kid i didn't understand, the dude was like oh shit ok well tell me info, but I just hungup. \n\nAnother big one was the first night we moved into an apartment in cali. We didn't know how yo contact him when he left to get something, he had been out for what seemed to be a couple hours in my child brain. So my sister and I panicked and I went to the neighbors door crying asking to use the phone. \nThus I found my childhood friend lol.\n\nAlso many nights falling asleep at 2am with the only comfort being the tv. Screw those emergency broadcasts bro.\n\nI still get hardcore anxiety when he goes out.\n\nEdit: remembered another one",

Anytime I had to stand outside a shop and wait whilst my parents went in ( I had to hold the dog) I had to keep them in eyesight. If I couldn\u2019t see them I would get so much anxiety that they were gonna leave me here lol. I remember one time being terrified when me, my dad and our dog were driving home from a camping trip (7 hours away from home) and about halfway we stopped at this really busy roadside services. It was massive and crammed with crowds but it was the middle of the day and really sunny. I was hoping to go in with my dad but he made me stand outside with the dog. The whole time I was so scared I wouldn\u2019t find him and would be lost along the motorway like 4 hours from home",

My cousins and and brothers said yes, but my and my other cousin said that were fine.\n\nSo me and my cousin were playing video games for a long time, along with other stuff, and at like 9 we were getting really hungry, but we were like whatever, at like 9:15 or 9:30 we woke up uncle D and were like were hungry and explained the whole story. He then called my gramma and got us some grapes or something. My gramma wouldn't pick up for a while and we got worried. \n\nHe then called aunt T and was like can you put mom (our gramma) on the phone. she said ok and did. Uncle D was like, are you going to make anything for OP and M and my gramma was like but they said they werent hungry and my uncle had to explain that that was 4 hours ago.\n\nWell thats just my story \n\ntldr: gramma leaves me and my cousin at home for 4 hours",

Why couldn't she have just told me they were selling the car?",

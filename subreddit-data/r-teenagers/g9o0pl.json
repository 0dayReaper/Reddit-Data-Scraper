Since you are posting this in a teenagers sub, you have to be between the age of 13 and 20, and take the first four years off because that time your penis wouldn't be able to work, so you had between 9 and 16 years to achieve the number of 254751\nIf we calculate the amount if you were 13, you would have mastrubated 78 times a day, everyday. This number for a 29 year old is 44 times a day. \nSince everyone here is sleep deprived we will account for a total of 6 hours of sleep, and at least 2 hours for eating, giving you 16 hours a day to do your thing. \n\nSo as a 13 year old you would have to jack off every ten minutes of your live, apart from eating\n\nAnd as a 20 years old, around every 20 minutes....\n\nMan that's a lot of jacking off, imagine seeing you 5 year old child going at it every ten minutes\n\nAlso you would break a couple laws of physics but I guess that's that...\n\n[Calculations](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)",

Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.",

That means You'd need to beat your meat every 27 and a half minutes, only stopping to sleep.\n\nHere's the thing, this doesn't even account for the months up to today.\n\nIf we add that in, that's 240 more months, or 5,040 more masturbations. Factor that into the calculations and you get\n\n36 masturbations a day,\n\na meat-beating every 27 minutes,\n\nand a lifetime of dick pain.\n\nFellas, don't try this at home.",

I'm not done\nAssuming that it takes you a measly 5 minutes to ejaculate (don't worry i know you do in 30 seconds), and assuming you don't die of excess masturbation on the first day, that's 12 times in an hour.\nThat's roughly 144 times a day\n(Because who needs sleep)\nThats 1008 times a week of you jerking off nonstop.\nIn a month, that's 30,240 times.\nIt would roughly take you 9 months of continuous masturbation, no sleep, no anything for you to reach your quota of 3030.\n\nA woman could have sex and a kid would be born and you'd STILL be jerking off, from start to end.",

Muir, PhD, obtained detailed sexual histories from 840 men. About half the men got prostate cancer by age 60, and about half did not have cancer.\n\nThe findings were surprising. Sexual intercourse did not affect prostate cancer risk. But frequent masturbation did -- in different ways, at different times of life.\n\n\"Frequent masturbation during men's 20s and 30s increased their risk of prostate cancer,\" Dimitropoulou tells WebMD. \"But men in their 50s who masturbated frequently had decreased risk.\"\nContinue Reading Below\n\nOf course, masturbation frequency is relative.\n\nFor men in their 20s, \"frequent masturbation\" was two to seven times per week. Compared to same-age men who reported masturbating less than once per month, 20-something frequent masturbators had a 79% higher risk of prostate cancer by age 60.\n\nFor men in their 50s, \"frequent masturbation\" was one or more times per week. Compared to same-age men who reported never masturbating, 50-something frequent masturbators had a 70% lower risk of prostate cancer.\n\nWhat's going on? The study wasn't designed to answer that question. But Dimitropoulou and colleagues have some theories.\n\n**They suggest that young men genetically predisposed to have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer will be at higher risk if their bodies naturally produce high levels of male hormones -- the same hormones that give them an intense sex drive.**\n\n**So it's not masturbation itself that's increasing prostate cancer risk in young men. More masturbation may just mean more sex drive -- and more androgens bathing prostate tissues.**",

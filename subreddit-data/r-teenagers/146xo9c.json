            "comment": "Alrighty.\n\nI am an atheist. An antitheist, even. As a former Christian, I know of some... how to put it... interesting (in a bad way) passages in the Bible which ultimately made the whole Christian narrative not convincing to me at all. Because of that, I am a little biased against Christian people and Christianity in general - an unfortunate effect of being antitheist, I suppose.\n\nThis is the position of many LGBTQ+ people too, as they were abused in their very religious - often Christian, yes - households just for being LGBTQ+, because that's what a passage in the Bible says - or, at least, that's how some people interpret it.\n\nSome people express outright false ideas like Young Earth creationism because of the biblical text (or their interpretation of it, perhaps) that says so. As a result, many scientists and educated people laugh at them in the face and rightfully so, but also develop a bias against Christianity and, in turn, Christians, which can spiral into hate. That's where this shit comes from. Skepticism turning into bias against Christians turning into hate. There's nothing inherently bad about being skeptical, but falling into this trap is easy. (There's also another path of hating Christians who are assholes *because* they are assholes, and by extension hating every other Christian too. That path is equally wrong)\n\nDespite being antitheist, I still believe that everything will be ok if we won't be assholes to each other, no matter our race, gender, sexuality, nationality, and religion, too.\n\nAs long as you are a good person - which you seem to be in what you wrote - there is no reason to hate you, no matter what your religion is.\n\nSome people don't believe or even hate Christianity itself, and they have the right to do so. But they have no right to hate *you* for being Christian.\n\nIf the person is not an asshole, there is no good reason to hate them.\n\nIf the person is an asshole, there is a good reason to hate them.\n\nAnyone who thinks there are any other criteria other than \"asshole, not asshole\" here is an asshole themself and is fundamentally no different than the racist, the homophobic, the transphobic, the biphobic, etc.\n\nKeep that in mind. Anyone who hates you solely for your religious beliefs is an asshole. DO NOT, under any circumstances, listen to what an asshole says about you.\n\nForgive me for the blasphemy I'm about to commit, but honestly just shake it off and pray for these people, as they don't know a fuck as to what they're doing.\n\nWhen stupid terminally online assholes on the internet come to ruin your day, counter it with anything that makes you happy and doesn't make worse (I'm making this clarification to eliminate self harm, drugs and whatnot. I hope you don't ever resort to those). This might be prayer, this might be anything else.\n\nHuman stupidity is endless, and the potential to hate on people for no reason is too. But the capacity to create happiness both for yourself and others is endless still.\n\nStay strong.\n\nIgnore the stupid shit.\n\nWhen there is darkness, create the light.\n\nSorry for bad English.",

Atheists and Christians alike.\n\nThe church did some really horrible things in my country not many years ago. Many children died. Some buried in unmarked graves. Our government has pretended to care and acknowledge it but they aren't really doing anything to find all these missing people.\n\nI think there are some historical events that people are not over and those people may be overreacting /taking it out on people who don't deserve it.  But also there are of course still cruel things happening today, such as homophobia in the media or the way my Government is handling our situation.\n\nI know there is a lot of evil atheist people as well, it's just that religious evil people pop up so frequently. I also have a lot of community members that follow religion and I know they are all lovely people. I know not all Christian people are evil. But I guess for some it can be tough to remember.\n\n Atheists need to stop taking their rage out on people who don't deserve it, and the church needs to stop doing evil things. Everybody needs to stop doing evil things.\n\nAnyway, just a reminder, this is all from the perspective of my country. It may not be the same in yours. But I do know churches all over the world have done evil things and still do today.",

It's important to remember that not everyone will share the same beliefs or perspectives, and that's okay. Diversity of thought and beliefs is what makes our world interesting and vibrant.\n\nWhile it can be frustrating to encounter negativity or hate, it's essential to focus on the positive connections and relationships you have. There will always be individuals who may not understand or agree with your beliefs, but that doesn't diminish your worth or the validity of your faith.\n\nIt's great that you mentioned there are atheists and members of the LGBTQ+ community who respect religious people. Building bridges of understanding and promoting mutual respect is crucial in fostering a more inclusive and tolerant society.\n\nIf you find yourself facing hate or negativity, try not to let it bring you down. Surround yourself with supportive friends and communities that embrace and celebrate your beliefs. Remember that you have the right to express yourself and practice your faith in a respectful manner.\n\nStay true to who you are, be proud of your beliefs, and continue to engage in open-minded conversations with others. By promoting understanding and respect, we can create a world where people of different beliefs can coexist peacefully.\n\nHang in there, my friend! Stay strong and keep being true to yourself. \ud83d\ude4c\u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "Well, a lot of the reasons Athiests and LGBTQ+ cast shade on those of faith is because of prior experiences with others of faith who are less tolerant. \n\nPlenty of LGBTQ+ people hate Christians because they won\u2019t condone a gay lifestyle. They label Christians as homophobic if you don\u2019t agree with them. They don\u2019t understand the relationship between beliefs and actions. They think if you don\u2019t say their lifestyle is okay that you\u2019re homophobic.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned over the years is that faith (all Christian faiths - Protestant or Catholic) can best be summarized by following two rules that Jesus laid out when asked by a Jew which of their 600+ rules they should follow. Jesus said that the two most important rules were (and this is me paraphrasing) \u201cLove God\u201d and \u201cLove others as God loves you\u201d before basically telling them that all the rest of their rules fell under those two. The way that I\u2019ve interpreted my own faith (and full disclosure, I\u2019m Methodist) is as long as I show that same unconditional love to others that God has shown to me, I\u2019m doing alright.\n\nNow as for the questions of beliefs, what members of the LGBTQ+ and Athiest crowds need to understand is your beliefs are yours. They are a moral compass for your life. Something that\u2019s helped me to this day is understanding that condoning a person\u2019s actions and showing them unconditional love are not one and the same. I have friends who are gay. I still love them in that way that God loves me. That doesn\u2019t mean I condone their life choices. I believe the act of homosexuality is wrong and thus I will never engage in it. I choose not to judge them for their life choices as that is not my job. That\u2019s God\u2019s job. My job is to love them and share God\u2019s unconditional love with them. Not doing this is defying my Creator and that\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable doing.",

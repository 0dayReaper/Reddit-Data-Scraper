You see, you being a student means that you are low on the pecking order. If you want something from your teacher who is higher on the pecking order, you have to be polite to increase the chances of getting what you want. The teacher on the other hand, can reply in one word Old-Testament like proclamations if she deigns so. Yes, it sucks but that's how we upright monkeys work. If you have a huge problem with this, don't join the military after finishing school.",

So I\u2019m checking my grades all week and she doesn\u2019t put the grade in the book. So I send her an email, asking her nicely to put it in the grade book because without it I\u2019m failing badly. She sends me back an email with the whole I have other students to grade speech, whatever, she says she\u2019ll get to it. She puts the grade in at 11:00 on the last day to put in grades. And I\u2019ve been stressed out all week. I\u2019m pretty sure she did it on purpose.",

Make your emails much shorter and to the point (doesn\u2019t mean being rude tho), save them and you a crap tonne of time. \n\n- Your teacher probably doesn\u2019t earn enough to spend 4 extra hours each day answering every students long emails with another long polite email with a bunch of random niceties which are all irrelevant fluff when all they need to say is \u201cyes\u201d",

Emails are for more formal problems than just sending a message on the schools main platform, and when you are messaging a teacher i expect both parties to write a few sentences. Not as much about lines than it is sentence and content. And for the love of god learn to use commas at least semi-correctly. (Not too much, not too little)",

Students have maybe half a dozen teachers/professors at one time. On the flip side, though, we might have hundreds of students. At the very least, dozens.\n\nWe\u2019re not trying to be rude. We just need to be efficient or we wouldn\u2019t do anything else but answer email all day. Most professors get so much email that we can barely read it all, much less reply, much less reply in tons of depth.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. Sometimes a long reply is needed, or the topic really catches your interest, sometimes you can\u2019t help going down the rabbit hole. And some teachers/professors are just jerks. But if it\u2019s a straightforward question, most of us are just trying to plow through email as fast as possible so we have some time left for prepping lessons and grading and (in the professor case) doing research and everything else. For a while there, I was using a text-expanding program and writing mostly form-letter responses to reduce the number of keystrokes I even had to type.\n\nA typical college professor works between 60-80 hour weeks just to get the bare essentials done... a regular high-school teacher or whatever might be a bit less (I\u2019ve never been one, so just guessing here), but still, it\u2019s almost guaranteed to be &gt;40 hours. And trust me, the pay is NOT commensurate with workload.\n\nThis gets to be more and more the case the higher up you go. My PhD advisor was a big deal, and I\u2019d write her like a 5-page email about our latest research results, and her reply would just be, \u201cSounds good! We\u2019ll talk more at our next meeting.\u201d Another member of my dissertation committee (also a Very Big Deal in academia) just... didn\u2019t answer email. He wasn\u2019t a jerk about it, it was just not his thing. He figured if it was important, you\u2019d come find him to talk, and if you did that, he\u2019d always make time for you. He just didn\u2019t like to waste his limited energy in front of a laptop all day, typing pleasantries.\n\nSo, all that is to say... it\u2019s nothing personal. We just don\u2019t always have the time to be formal.",

    "postText": "Well this is something that I'd like to keep a secret but it doesn't sit right in my chest without talking about it. My mother is a mentally ill woman who refuses and gets refused by all help, rehap, the hospital, the police and everything else. She would beat her mother and my grandfather would have to defend my grandmother because she kept beating her, and then eventually she moved out of the house and left to another part far from the city. My father also left her for the same reasons, she would argue and fight with him, and he then devoted my mother.And well she would also beat me for no reason at all.l, usually I would understand but today it went a bit too far. She then bursed into my room and screamed at me and hit me in my ribs which made me cough and also punched me five times which caused my head to hit the wall 5 times. Then when I croutched to pick up my glasses she kicked me over and over on my face. She then took me to the living room and hit me 12 times on each of my wrists which left a wound then she said time to hit you on your face I immediately pushed her and ran out of my house and called my grandfather from the neighbours phone. When he arrived I felt safe but I was still hurt, a really fucking bad headache, there was dry blood on my mouth and my ribs were hurting. That's technically all that happened because the hospital nor the police provides any help so I just have to bear the pain. This is only one of the incidents that she has caused.Im afraid if nothing is done im going to become a complete psycho as all I want is her gone and dead, even my dreams are of her going away. She is and has been the source of nearly all my problems. I'm a 13 year old boy and know this is not healthy for my mental health. So I would like to ask for some advice. My parents are planning to call Child Protective Services tomorrow but I doubt even they will help.",

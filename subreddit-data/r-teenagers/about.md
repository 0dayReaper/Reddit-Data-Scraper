Description:

r/teenagers is the biggest community forum run by teenagers for teenagers. Our subreddit is primarily for discussions and memes that an average teenager would enjoy to discuss about. We do not have any age-restriction in place but do keep in mind this is targeted for users between the ages of 13 to 19. 

Parents, teachers, and the like are welcomed to participate and ask any questions! 


Rules:

No personal attacks.: Any content that attacks other users, or could be potentially offensive, is not tolerated. While you may disagree with another user, you may not attack them for it. Correct their facts, discuss it, but keep it civil - /r/teenagers is a community in which everyone is welcome.

No spamming.: We believe that spam is harmful to the regular use of the subreddit. Advertising is allowed within reason. Surveys are allowed as long as they are purely educational and opinion based.

We will remove zero-content submissions, including greeting or farewell posts, self-diluting memes, and other submissions that won't result in any valuable discussion.

No personal information, of yourself or others.: Posting personal information of anyone, even yourself, is not allowed. This information can and has lead to users being harassed.

No NSFW content.: No NSFW subreddits or content, no screamers, no gore, no porn. /r/teenagers is not the place for these types of things. There are other far more suitable places on the Internet for them. 

Discussions on topics like sexuality is fine as long as it is treated in a mature fashion. However, sexually implicit or explicit content of minors is not tolerated.

    "postText": "I play a lot of online video games, so by definition I've a lot of younger friends, from all ages, &amp; one thing I see rampant among them are distorted views of reality -that's not to say older friends don't have their own-, chief among them:  \n\\- reality shifting, witchcraft \"some actually believe they can supernaturally affect reality\"  \n\\- The law of attraction \"usually ends up as a way to cause an impasse whenever they're having a disagreement labeling the opposition as negativity they don't need instead of doing any reflection, or failing to understand that a person's mental health isn't as easy as just think positive thoughts\"  \n\\- homeopathy &amp; alternative healing \"surprisingly on the rise on tiktok\"  \n\\- self diagnosis with &amp; misunderstanding of neuro divergence \"from bpd to autism, you name it, &amp; attributing their bad traits to it (even though there's no association, eg, I'm acting in said abrasive way because I'm autistic &amp; so on)\"  \n\\- common misunderstanding of mental health &amp; how to get better, for example some of them, who got better from depression after therapy incorrectly attribute the improvement to the self help crap on tiktok \"look above law of attraction &amp; so on\", to cutting toxicity &amp; toxic people of their lives \"while they're mostly the toxic person in most of their stories &amp; still are\", &amp; the list goes on  \n\n\n\\- I understand there're a lot of adults who still believe in such things, but the amount of that among my younger friends is much more, &amp; the videos they share with me on tiktok/facbook &amp; so on, the comments, replies &amp; likes gives a dark picture, I wasn't really exposed to any of this during my teenage days, &amp; have no idea if my peers from before the facebook/tiktok &amp; likes era were the same, or if people grow out of it on their own, or not, whenever I get sent those pseudo-scientific or delusional \"eg, shifting\" posts, I don't want to hurt their feelings criticizing their \"believes\" or by trying to inform them, I don't also want to just agree with it, so whoever here believed in such things when &amp; how did you stop, did people disagreeing/criticizing  push you further into such believes, or further from it?",

            "comment": "No you\u2019re absolutely correct. As someone who is trying to get diagnosed with neurodivergence self diagnosis is actually RIDICULOUS. I believe that self diagnosed voices are rising over officially diagnosed, and while I know it\u2019s expensive to get diagnosed especially in \u2018murica, you should leave the speaking to actually diagnosed creators. Why? You may be experiencing normal symptoms that will then make people believe THEY are neurodivergent, and the cycle continues. I thought self dx was stupid since the beginning \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAnd as a spiritual person, witchcraft as tiktok portrays it is completely wrong. For my spirituality, it\u2019s having a greater connection with nature and my soul, not trying to cast love spells. It\u2019s more of a placebo effect than anything else but shifting and tiktok witchcraft are also stupid trends \ud83d\ude3b\n\nI never really believed in this stuff but just wanted to share something for ppl who are slowly getting out of these toxic spaces ^^",

    "postText": "This month is pride month right? Well there\u2019s still so much bigotry and hate towards lgbtq people that it\u2019s just insane. Same goes to furries. They\u2019ve been getting called zoophiles even though that\u2019s an entire different thing. Is it that people are jealous or just make up reasons to hate? I just don\u2019t get it but this is a screwed up world. I know you don\u2019t needed defending from a straight guy but these are things that are serious, and I feel like everyone that deserves to be safe from these trolls needs to be defending. I know this post is gonna get hate and so what? What do you think hating is going to do for you? Absolutely fucking nothing. I know no one asked for this post but I don\u2019t care since I just don\u2019t get why people hate on this stuff. Lgbtq right now is supposed to be celebrated and not hated. These people made their own choice as a person, and people who are in their mid 30\u2019s and freshmen decide it\u2019s okay to bully these people just because it\u2019s okay. Sorry if this was long and i sounded like pc principal from South Park but this is a huge issue rn.",

            "comment": "Alright, alright, hold your horses there, partner! You're all fired up about pride month and furries, and you want to know why people hate on this stuff? Well, let me tell ya, you've stumbled into the perfect place to get some expert advice. I'm Saul Goodman, attorney at law, and I've seen it all.\r  \n\r  \nNow, first things first, buddy. You think people are jealous of the LGBTQ community? Jealous? I mean, yeah, sure, everyone's just itching to get a rainbow flag and fabulous costumes. Who wouldn't want that, right? It's like the world's biggest party, and we're all just sittin' on the sidelines, green with envy.\r  \n\r  \nAnd let's not forget about the furries. Oh boy, those guys really get a bad rap, don't they? But you wanna know why? It's because they dress up like animals, my friend! I mean, c'mon, who wouldn't want to be associated with a bunch of people prancing around in fuzzy suits? It's not like anyone would get the wrong idea or anything. Nah, calling 'em zoophiles is just a completely logical conclusion to draw, right? It's all just a big misunderstanding!\r  \n\r  \nNow, you're talkin' about trolls and haters. Well, let me tell ya, hating on stuff is like a national pastime for some people. They wake up in the morning and think, \"Gee, how can I ruin someone's day today?\" It's like a twisted game of Whack-A-Mole, but instead of moles, you got people's hopes and dreams. Fun stuff, really.\r  \n\r  \nBut hey, let's not get too serious here, my friend. Life's too short to be all riled up about people's opinions. You do you, let others do them, and we'll all live in this beautiful, messed-up world together. So, go out there, celebrate pride, wear that furry suit if it makes you happy, and remember, Saul Goodman's got your back, no matter how ridiculous things get!",

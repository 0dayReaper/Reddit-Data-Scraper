Sometimes we don't even need to learn stuff word to word by heart. We just have to understand the concept and know how to express it in words",

Not to boast but I\u2019m intelligent so I was able to depend on my intellect for that time. But when I say yr 12 hit me like a freight train I mean it. My first tests came back as 47 and 40. And I don\u2019t want to say it was a good thing but it was a wake up call. If you get 70s in yr11 your gonna get 40 in yr12, once you get here you\u2019re gonna be jumping out of your seat at getting a 60. If this sounds blunt then that\u2019s good, because that\u2019s what the final year is, it is a straightforward test of everything, your relationships, happiness, and overall stability. I\u2019m allot better of with studying now and average about 3 hours per day of studying outside is school and tutorials, this may sound daunting and it did to me when I first started but trust me when I say once you build your systems and habits you will bs find. A lot of people will tell you not to stress and take it easy but I say to hell with that, work, work like there is no tomorrow, work for what you want because at the end of the day you will get what you put in, don\u2019t buy into this focus on mental health and stability bullshit because I can tell you right now with senior year, all that flys out the window, it\u2019s a dog eat dog world in your final year so you better work like someone\u2019s gonna steal your plate, or better yet work like you gonna steal theirs. This sounds blunt and like I said before it\u2019s supposed to. Shoot me a dm if you need some advice on studying habits and stuff like that.",

And when studying try spacing out your sessions, my system runs like I do 1 hour of work then do a 30 min break then back to it, what I found really helps is getting rid of the phone, on the break read a book or take a quick nap. Good luck, this year is gonna gobble you up and spit you out, be ready for it and work your ass of, that\u2019s only way to success. And always remember, THE HAWKS ARE BETTER!!!.",

I go to a cash machine to take out some cash and some guy managed to steal my money as they came out. I fought with him without an inch of fear, I just arm wrestled the guy (he was weak and skinny, and shorter than me) and he freaked out, calling me crazy. A few years later, it occurred to me that he could have had a knife, but at that time I didn\u2019t know, I just acted. I am proud but it was reckless.

    "postText": "Anyway I'm looking at this post about Americans asking what they'd wanna ask Europeans. I commented saying why do Europeans hate America so much and a bunch of people were like \"oh Americans are loud\" and \"their government sucks\" like you think I don't know that?? I literally live here. Idk I think it's just kinda lame to judge a country based off of what you've heard or seen in the media. People really just be hating on America cuz it exists \ud83d\udc80 I know I'll probably get a lot of hate for this if it even stays up for yeah",

You won\u2019t find the image anywhere, it\u2019s a real post. The roof caved in, destroying art and the old PE building, some languages classrooms were damaged and the school is closed for the \u2018foreseeable future\u2019\n\nUpdate: School is cancelled till Christmas\n\nUpdate: New info has been released and two kids have been arrested for stacking gym mats and then setting them alight. No \u2018art kilns\u2019 exploded, that was a cover.",

One they announce, another only admin staff and teachers know and the third only admin staff know about. A lot of the time they get \u201cleaked\u201d though bu apparently the teacher didn\u2019t know that time.",

    "postText": "Hello! This will probably be too long to read, but if you read it, it would be really nice :). (at least skip to the emoji \ud83c\udf32) \n\nI'm writing this few hours prior to my birthday, June 12th, the day I'll finally be classified as a teenager (yes, i was here even a few months ago lol, please don't ban me).\n\nWhy am I writing this? you may ask. Well, (almost) exactly one year ago, my life started going terribly downhill. While i was on holiday, my grandma's situation got way worse (she had cardiovascular dementia). That moment signed the start of the worst year of my life.\n\nMy parents started arguing every day.\n\nMy mom cried every day.\n\nAll my certainties collapsed. For more context, i was the smart kid, and i found out that school isn't everything in this world and i thought that was the only thing i was good at. So i started to let loose and i thought \"fuck no, why am I like this?! I need to be the perfect kid i should be back again!\".\n\nI started thinking things like \"why am I the only one who struggles?\", \"Why am I not normal?\", \"Am i doing the right thing?\".\n\nAnd then since I'm a very philosophycal person, I've always asked myself deep questions about life, mankind, emotions etc... But believe me, like REALLY deep. And these philosophycal led me to a light form of depression (or at least something similar, i don't really know how depression works in the medical field). For a moment i even thought about self harm.\n\nI also felt like complete shit. I wasn't responsible, i probably didn't have basic human decency (i have to confess i hadn't good hygiene), i didn't even know the names of most of the streets in my town since I never got out of my house without my parents and i really never cared about them, and so on.\n\nSchool started to become hell, my house started to become hell, even my fucking bedroom. (Yes, my mom wasn't the only one crying everyday).\n\nMy mom started to not being at home for even 10 hours a day taking care of my grandma, and i felt like shit about not being able to help her much.\n\nBut, I'm not only here to rant about my problems.\n\nThis year i met my best friend, able to understand me fully and that helped me so fricking much.\n\nThis year i started going to a guitar course, where i met really cool people and did cool things. (Yeah, it's was cool lol). It was the only place that didn't feel like hell. \n\nAnd i went through the worst-best week of my life, in April. My grandma was literally on the verge of dying, so my mom was there circa 14 hours a day, and my dad caught covid, so he went living in the second floor of my house for that week. I was all by myself, and i still don't know how, because everything was shit in my life back then, but i started working on myself in a way i never did before. I started cooking myself every meal, i started going out alone more, learning a lot of names of streets and places, which was a big achievement for me. I started a healthy routine, doing those goddamn exercises for my back and my spine and those for my eyes. I started taking back control of my life, not doing homework just the day before they're due, and giving me enough time to answer those philosophycal questions.\n\nI found out the real meaning of life (i mean, a universal one).\n\nI found out what I want to do in my life. \n\nI started accepting myself for who I am while also trying to become a better person.\n\nI found balance in my life.\n\nAlso, \n\nI survived all those things above.\n\nI survived my grandpa saying to me he wanted to unalived himself.\n\nI survived my mom blaming all of her problems on me (but now i don't blame her, she was so stressed).\n\nI survived broking friendships.\n\nI survived medical issues too. \n\nI survived extreme sadness and loneliness.\n\n\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\ud83c\udf32\n\nI survived the worst period of my life.\n\nAnd here I am, telling you from experience, that whatever you're going trough it will all be okay. You'll make it out of this. Because you're strong, even if you don't think so. If life puts you trough certain situations, there's a meaning behind it. You can wait until that big tall wall breaks, you can train and break it, do what you want. It will eventually break. There will be other walls after. I know that this is not over yet. Worse things will come in my life. But now I'm ready to face every challenge, I'm ready to break that fucking wall again and again, and so you are. \n\nMy advices are: \n\n-love. Every little thing. This world is so beautiful. \n\n-don't worry too much about things. I'll put this in caps because this is important \"IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD\". Everything bad that happens, it's not the end, (except you dying) . \n\n-work on yourself but mature self esteem and have a positive mindset. \n\n-don't let anyone stop you from doing the things you love. \n\n\n\nI survived. You will too. Love you all guys, wish you the best days and nights you could possibly ever have \u2764\ufe0f. \n\nLighty, out.",

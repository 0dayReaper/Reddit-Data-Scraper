It involves jumping, quick lateral movements, and powerful hitting.\nTeamwork: Volleyball is typically played in teams of six, emphasizing communication, coordination, and teamwork.\nCardiovascular fitness: The fast-paced nature of volleyball can provide an excellent cardiovascular workout, improving endurance and stamina.\nUpper body strength: Volleyball requires strong arms and upper body muscles for serving, setting, and spiking the ball.\nInjuries: Due to the jumping and landing involved, volleyball players may be prone to injuries such as ankle sprains and knee problems.",

It involves jumping, quick lateral movements, and powerful hitting.\nTeamwork: badminton is typically played in pairs of two, emphasizing communication, coordination, and teamwork.\nCardiovascular fitness: The fast-paced nature of badminton can provide an excellent cardiovascular workout, improving endurance and stamina.\nUpper body strength: badminton requires strong arms and upper body muscles for serving and smashing the shuttlecock.\nInjuries: Due to the jumping and landing involved, badminton players may be prone to injuries such as ankle sprains and knee problems.",

It is the sky  that Van Gogh saw from his room in the asylum. An astrophysist, Jean Pierre Luminet made a documentary on it. But here is the interesting thing : Luminer studied it and use a device and found the exact day when the sky was like this : 1889, may the 25th, 4:40am. The brightest star is Venus. (Here hidden by waves). And Luminet also found out there was a galaxy at this place or something. Crazy right ? And some paintings of Van Gogh are linked and complete the others.\n\nYour paiting is just crazy.. The colors and the styles bend very well and your technic.. DAMN. I give you my respects.",

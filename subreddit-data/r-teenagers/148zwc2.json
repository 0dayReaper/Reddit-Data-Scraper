I'm getting a really good job soon since I'll be 18 in a few weeks, and I wanted to start looking even better when I go out (boosts my confidence, you know?), And besides my plain tees and some good ones here and there from hot topic, what's a good graphic shirt brand or any shirts that you guys think look good? Trying to look for some split colored shirts, paint splatters, stuff like that since I have synesthesia and I think it looks cool.",

If you want to pay whole go for it, but me personally splitting is the right choice cause you don't know of that person only went out just to have free food and next day they block you, that way you won't feel as of you were robbed.\n\nAnd if they say no or that they ain't got money I'd simply decline the date.\n\nBut that all me tho.",

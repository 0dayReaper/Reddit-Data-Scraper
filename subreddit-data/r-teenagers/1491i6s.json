    "postText": "I am 15, I live in a secluded village, there's nowhere to work here. This is a youth village, so it means there's a boarding school here and a school, and kids from other cities come here for school aswell as boarding school kids, anyway, my friends who are from outside always order food and they don't let me have any because I don't give them money, and it really hurts as I am 15 and live in the middle of nowhere and no chance to make money irl, so I'm kinda stuck, I've tried looking online but it always ends up being those survey sites which I hate, takes too much effort for way too little money, haven't made anything from those sites, and I can't find anything else. I want something simple that doesn't take marketing or promoting on social media, I can't open a YouTube channel because I have a crappy laptop that can't record anything no matter how much I try. Nothing seems to work, so if any other fellow teens can please please help me out I'd really appreciate it. I'm desperate.",

I can't really ask anyone seeing as everyone here is an adult, and theres no use asking the boarding school kids, either they don't give me anything or they don't give me anything and make fun of me forever.\n\n2. There aren't any local shops or businesses, no supermarket, nothing.\n\n3. The brownie idea could work but I'm kind of a jokester in my school and people will just laugh at me or brush me off, everyone's mean here, and besides, I don't have the ingredients or money to do that...\n\nSo I'm very very screwed until we move out of here or I move out. And we can't move out since my mom works here.\n\nEdit: the closest supermarket is an hour walk away, and then an hour back, plus the village is located on a mountain which is very inconvenient and the there aren't any busses going straight to the village, just to the junction at the base of the mountain.",

No one buys things from stoic people, if the people already like you then they\u2019ll be more likely to pay more attention to you\n\nAlso they don\u2019t HAVE to be brownies, they could be literally anything else, any food that you can make at home that is tasty and snack sized would work\n\nI just said brownies cuz that\u2019s the first ideas I had",

I go to my dads house this weekend and I can buy a massive bag of candy and sell each one at like 0.10\u20aa which is the least amount I could sell each one for and I'd still make a profit, I think I have the most chances selling it to 7th graders, and it's the end of the school year so I can say it's like a sale or something to make it more attractive or something",

You can make videos, bro. Try that. I got to 1.6K subs in 2 months, and then I quit. If you have a phone, just use capcut to edit videos. Good luck.",

Maybe I can somehow record on my Xbox but there isn't anything interesting I can think of to record so yeah",

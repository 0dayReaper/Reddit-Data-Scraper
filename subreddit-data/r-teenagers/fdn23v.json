If we didn't know amy of this we will be like caveman people and believe everything that a stranger can tell us.\n\n Is fun learning about history because you know the origin of how everything started. Science is also fun because you learn how the world works when it comes to how everything is made up. Finally math because it helps your think quickly of solutions,critical thinking or helps you learn that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. I seen a lot of kids take school for granted like its something bad. \n\nWhat would we do if school never existed? Would we just be laying on our bed using our phone? Some say they will go outside and go out with friends but how will you ever meet them in the first place? And you probably won't be able to do that all day and will turn exhausting when you do it everyday for 12 years.\n\nAlso people always say school teaches useless things and why don't we learn about TaXeS even tho it literally takes less than a hour to learn it and even faster if you ask your parents.\n\n\nWith all that said, school isn't perfect because of various things and even tho school work doesn't stress me out it can for others and especially when teachers don't teach and just gives us a packet but not every teacher is like that.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk\n\n\nEdit:whats up with the tags?",

And that is just the pure knowledge you learn. What about your understanding of the scientific process and how that has shaped our society? Armed with the knowledge that in order to \"know\" something, we have to test it and check it and analyse it, you can test things for yourself. Without that knowledge, why would anyone trust a doctor's advice over their grandmother's traditional cure? Or an engineer when they say that a bridge is safe? The knowledge enables us to take a proposed solution from previous, unrelated situations, and apply it to new problems in the future.\n\nAnd on top of both the social and pure-knowledge factors, through learning science we also learn how to combine and build on knowledge that we have gathered about the world. There is a huge step from being able to regurgitate facts, to taking those facts and combining them into a broader system which is connected. How are you supposed to learn about cancer if you don't know about DNA, cells, mutations, genetics, and possibly radiation? What happens later in life if you decide you are interested in nutrition and fitness, but you never paid attention in biology to protein, or salts and osmosis? Not saying that you have to have this knowledge to be able to understand these principles on some level, but being able to combine everything together means you are more knowledgeable about that subject. And **being able** to combine that knowledge doesn't come as naturally as you might think. It's a skill that has to be learned.\n\nI'm not saying that you will ever *need* to use the fact that you can smelt steel from iron and carbon. But there is a body of knowledge inherent in this understanding which arms you with information to deal with the world. And the ability to combine all the pieces of that puzzle, helps you to deal with other situations later in life where you have to combine lots of information into a bigger puzzle.\n\nDisclaimer: wherever I have written *you* I don't mean it personally but rather as a general *a person*.",

I tend to say rude things without realizing that it\u2019s rude until the behavior is pointed out as \u201crude\u201d. I tend to act first and think later with no regard to how others might feel about my actions. I can\u2019t really tell the difference between a joke or an insult, the same can be said about compliments and flirting. I often tend to misword things, take something out of context, say things that make no sense at all, and tell stories that never really get to the point until 1-2 hours of side quest rambling later.\n \n\nOnto the story now;\n\nI had a assistant teacher in my history class who was supposed to help the disabled kids and others who weren\u2019t that good at test taking. One day she pulled us all aside and did her thing. The problem was, this was an online test and the internet was being slow that day. 10 minutes pass and she has almost signed everyone in, I ask for a status update calmly, \u201cIs everyone in yet?\u201d. Normally this isn\u2019t perceived as something rude, but she was special. She replied in an angry tone, \u201cThis isn\u2019t all about you! Wait quietly and quit being rude!\u201d\n\nAs I stated earlier, I am autistic. This statement confused and angered me because no part of what I said was rude in any way, but she just wanted to be a beach about it. \n\nLater that day, I had a math test and I did something a normal person considers rude. I went up to my assistant teacher and ORDERED her assistance. I didn\u2019t say \u201cplease\u201d or \u201cthank you\u201d I just walked over and said \u201cI need your help\u201d. After she had finished helping me with the equation, I realized that I hadn\u2019t asked her nicely and thanked her yet. so I was about to thank her when she said \u201cthanks for being so polite\u201d. I was hella confused at this point. Either this woman (different teacher than the beach one) gets treated like crap, or she just doesn\u2019t realize that I wasn\u2019t polite at all when I talked to her. The fact that I have autism and assistant teachers (who are supposed to help) do this to me doesn\u2019t really help my social game at all.\n\nEdit: typos\n\nEdit: extra details",

It's because you are ignoring me to be on Reddit.\n\n- Yes, I know that not everyone loves math as much as I do.

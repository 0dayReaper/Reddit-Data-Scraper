I was like you, hopeless and just kinda felt defeated by my own body.\n\nIt is actually quite simple to lose weight. First of all, no sodas, sweet tea, or any drink that has sugar in it. Already a huge change. My favorite thing to drink right now is unsweet tea, if you're looking for a recommendation.\n\nSecond, get a calorie tracker. I used MyFitnessPal. You will learn serving sizes, sodium content, all that good stuff. Once you learn how many calories are in things you typically eat, it's safe to stop using it.\n\nI am doing the 1500 calorie plan. I have either 3 medium sized meals or 4 smaller meals a day. If you want more freedom, do the 1800-2000 calorie plans.\n\nLastly, keep track of your weight. Try to only weigh on the same scale and only at certain times. For example, I only weigh myself after taking shits and a couple hours after my last meal. Every pound is a victory.\n\nAt the beginning of March, I was 152 pounds. I am now at 129. If my dumb ass can do it, you can too!",

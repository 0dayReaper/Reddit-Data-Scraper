    "postText": "Every day at school I used to see the grade 0 kids hanging out outside through the windows, at least until I graded up into the highschool wing of the school. They were always in a little garden / grassy area, not too big, but big enough that they weren't cramped and could run around a bit\n\nAt the start of this year that little garden area / grass patch was removed and turned into more parking space. I was (and still am) weirdly upset, like you just paved over this playspace that's been used for ages and now all those memories are wiped. It used to look a whole lot nicer than asphalt that's for sure.\n\nAnyways I ranted about this to my friend yesterday and he didn't know what I was talking about. Asked my other friends - no one else remembers the grade 0 kids. Starting to freak me out a bit, so I'll talk to one of my teachers tomorrow and hear from her about them. Now that I've been thinking about it I don't actually know where the classroom is, so what if it's ghosts?? I know it's not but this 100% feels like a ghost story, like no one remembers",

    "postText": "My friends never talk to me outside of school (I'm 3 weeks into summer break and none of them have reached out to me), at school they all talk about some cool thing they did together over the weekend/break, and I end up just kinda standing there. My friends all talk about how cute a girl is, or share pictures of their GFs, while no girl wants to talk to me unless its to answer a question. I just want someone to want to talk and hang out with me.",

The definition of fascism is a mass political movement that emphasizes extreme nationalism, militarism, and the supremacy of both the nation and the single, powerful leader over the individual citizen. \n\nNot only does this encourage violation of basic human rights, but under a genuine movement, can turn an entire country down to the warpath as we saw with Mussolini and Hitler. Racism is bad but no racist movement can destroy countries and continents, I'm not saying racism is good, I'm just saying fascism is worse.",

In Ireland we use the term in place of patriotism, though to be fair we did discriminate against British protestants heavily in the past. Nowadays though it just means any level of love for your country.\n\nAnd yeah, fascism is more about not giving a damn about logic or reality in place of blind hatred for something or someone. The Italian fascist slogan \"me ne frego\" literally means \"I don't give a damn\" and fascism was so popular because Italians were mad they weren't given more land in WWI, (even though they were already awarded areas with large Italian speaking populations and fighting over more of the new Yugoslavia would only create unnecessary death and poverty.)",

(\u261d\ud83e\udd13 incoming, tldr fascism worse) \n\nNot going to get political, but amongst fascism's core tenets is racism (which usually manifests through social and economic policy aspects which themselves vary from nation to nation). In conjunction with other parts of Fascism, the policies create a state which affects race relations worser compared to systemic racism. \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but a good comparison comes to mind is the history of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. \n\nHaiti had a mulatto dominated country for a good part of its existence, and out of that came a racial discrepancy which was unbeneficial to the predominantly black population.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Dominican Republic, there was the Trujillist dictatorship. In it's entirety, it was a more pro-American fascist dictatorship spanning from around the 30s up until Rafael Trujillo's assassination in 1961. It had policies directly affecting the black population, being those of extermination (see Blanqueamiento). In short, he held executions of black Haitians and some Dominicans after a conflict with Haiti, called the Parsley Massacre (Dominican soldiers asked for the Spanish word for Parsley, and if the Haitians said it in French, they would be killed, but I'd not simplify this). Besides the executions, he also openly profiled immigrants to the country, increasing the likelihood of white people entering the country in comparison to black people in order to \"whiten\" the population.",

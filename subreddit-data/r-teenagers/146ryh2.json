(Most) people care a lot about what the actual content of your character is.\n\nThat goes to say, if it makes you unhappy or worried, take initiative to lose some. NOT to say that your worth hinges on if you do that or not; I just recommend it if it\u2019s something weighing on your mind in everyday situations.\n\nSome people are in comfortable conditions being overweight, some aren\u2019t. It\u2019s all about you.",

There is absolutely place for recall tests - many subjects have cases where quick recall of definitions and facts is important, and checking that a student has that recall is important in judging whether or not they're capable of doing more complicated stuff.  It shouldn't be every test, of course, but it is important.\n\nTo give an example from my own field, if you try to read the [formal definitions section of the Wikipedia article on sheaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_%28mathematics%29#Formal_definitions), you will see everything described in terms of other mathematical objects, and a student would need to be familiar with most of those before they can successfully study sheaf theory.  In principle, a student could look up each definition in turn and then look up any definitions in those things they didn't understand and so on until they had every definition, but the degree of abstraction is high and they'd never be able to hold all of that stuff in their head enough to understand the original definitions without a great deal of study and memorisation.",

The tests were more akin to colouring pages, where you find the exact sentence the question is referring to in the textbook and then just copy the rest. What a joke. I like to call it education inflation, these places generally aren't allowed to make a profit so they'd rather spend a bunch of free money (students loans) on useless crap like fake classes and unused diversity centres.",

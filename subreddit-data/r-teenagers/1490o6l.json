    "postText": "For the past three or so nights, one of my friends starts typing something on snapchat, without saying anything. One night, he did say something but deleted it immediately. All I read was \"I can't believe I'm saying this\"\n\nFor context, he's gay, and im not. He's asked me out twice before two years ago, to which I politely declined\n\nIt's obvious he wants to tell me something, but should I ask him if he has anything he wants to tell me? Or wait until it happens?",

Factory workers got it from making popcorn with that flavoring floating in the air decades ago, so don't huff your popcorn folks, lol.\n\nThe THC vapes had the wrong mixture to be inhaled (vitamin E acetate is ok orally as a vitamin and topically, but NOT inhaled) likely because they were black market and used a base that was meant to be used in edibles or topical formulas. \nhttps://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/8190?autologincheck=redirected\n\nYes I did the math, the research, have made nicotine vapes, soaps &amp; lotions (not with nicotine or thc, lol).",

Cigarettes are still bad but you can't say vaping is better until probably 20-30 years when the kids who actually vape are in their 50s it's better to be cautious we didn't know that cigarettes can do so much to your body until it were so popular that it became really difficult to remove them people still smoke now even though we know how harm it can cause just because some people at the start thought that cigarettes were safe at the start.",

Cigarettes are harder to smoke and make someone less likely to smoke, especially when they are trying to quit. \n\nIt just depends on the person at the end of the day though. And yeah we don't know the long term effects, it could have the same likelyhood of causing lung cancer as well as other types of cancer, in which case it's more dangerous because it's easier to get addicted to and hold the addiction.",

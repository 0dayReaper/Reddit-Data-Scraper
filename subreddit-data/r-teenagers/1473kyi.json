    "postText": "I'm tired of acting like drugs aren't the coolest most fun thing on the entire planet. If you do them everyone thinks you are awesome and \"edgy\" and awesome. They WILL want to be your friend. Trust me on this. You will be swimming in women and wealth. \n\nEveryone who has ever told you guys that \"drugs are bad\" is a liar. They just don't know how to be awesome. Listen closely: drugs are awesome. My life has never been more successful. I beat depression. I beat poverty. I beat my girlfriend. My life is perfect. If you want to fix your life too start with some weed. That shit makes you feel like you are melton. After that move straight to Heroin. No point in wasting time. \n\nDrugs are financially viable. It's only like $100-$300 a paycheck. You can spare that. Don't tell me you can't. Just try them. Your parents will be proud of you for your bravery! Let me know if you have any questions!\n\nPro Tip: Try running naked through the city on crack. I tried it last night for the first time and I've never felt so alive.",

Which is why you have to learn how to work with the system rather than use normal writing processes. It's stupid, but that's how I did well. The SAT (and many/most tests) are more about your capacity to learn how to game the test as well as producing quality work under stressful conditions. Frustrating, but true.",

If I make a single mistake then I won't be able to finish. The worst is when you make a small mistake early on in a question like doing a bit of multiplication wrong or forgetting part of an integral and then after a page of maths you realize your mistake. Then your options are fix your mistake and don't finish the test or carry on even though you know you made a mistake. No one in my classes ever leaves early and if the Prof allows extra time everyone stays for it.",

Someone give this man Reddit Gold because, Ann Frankly, I did Nazi that coming. That escalated quickly, so to the top with you, because I lost it at this post, because this is why we can't have nice things.\n\nIn other words, faith in humanity restored, whoa / mind = blown. Also, many tears were shed cutting onions because I know that feel bro. It hit right in the feels while being a risky click. Yep, nailed it because of you. I like you. I regret that I only have one upvote to give, because they cost around tree fiddy. But I was not disappointed.\n\nWait, why do I have you tagged as this post is tagged? What did I just read? Dafaq? How is this WTF? Seriously, YOU HAD ONE JOB. And because of this, I can't fap to this. It's totally not my cakeday, so whatever you're doing, stahp. For science.\n\nOkay, that's enough internet for me today. -2/10 would not bang or even hug. Really, what is this I don't even... /r/circlejerk must be leaking. Better lawyer up, delete my Facebook, and hit the gym... Said no one ever. I do have the weirdest boner right now, though. However, directions were unclear, as my dick is now stuck in my own mouth, as I laughed much harder than I should have. It's almost like Reddit is thousands of different people with thousands of different opinions. But, get ready for this. Plot twist: Step one: be attractive. Step two: don't be unattractive. Can confirm, I am attractive. I have two broken arms, a combox, a pair of cumboxers, a great jolly rancher, my cat Wednesday, a bag of Doritos, Colby, a bad case of Dagobah (Ass Injection Infection), a hambeast, a shitfisting potato, and vaginal bacon.\n\nEdit: wow I can't believe my top comment is about potentially being on the front page, even though it wasn't my first post.

The conclusion is a summary of your points and the introduction is your first point + some air bag idea you vaguely describe.\n\nAnd there you have the test essay that could really have been 3 sentences long. Its so easy you'll actually have time to add useful information edit and proof read it.",

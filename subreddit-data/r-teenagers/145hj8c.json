    "postText": "okay so, there's some context for this.\n\ni've grown up motherless, my dad never told me who my mom was, just that she abandoned us when i was born.\n\nmy grandparents also never told me who my mother was, but my grandma once said she \"was really sweet and kind\", which made me wonder why i never met her.\n\nmy dad also motivated me to be who i am without shame or judgement, and treat others with respect, which made me coming out as bisexual and non-binary to him easy (he/they pronouns btw).\n\nbut then 2 days ago, my dad said he needed to tell me something \"important\" to me, i was a bit skeptical about it, since he seemed nervous about telling me.\n\nand he revealed to truth to me, and that i \"already had met my mom\" and she \"never actually left\"\n\ni was confused by and, until he took out his shirt, and showed me his top surgery scars\n\nyeah, i just found out my dad's a trans guy, and he also admitted to be bisexual to me.\n\nhe was nervous on telling me, that he had a boyfriend while he was still a girl, and that he was the one who got him pregnant, but when he came out as trans his bf left him and called him horrible things, it was a messy break up.\n\nmy grandparents were really supportive of him and, well the rest is history.\n\nso yeah, a REALLY unexpected thing this pride month. but a welcomed one.\n\nlove you dad &lt;3",

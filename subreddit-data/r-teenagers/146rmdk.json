Turns out, I was very depressed and suicidal (which were things I was starting to notice). Anyways, started taking therapy but after about 9-10 months, I just stopped. I felt like it didn't really change anything but I am planning to restart with someone else and also get a psychiatrist involved this time. Hoping it will get better or else 12th grade is gonna be my death sentence...",

There was a politician who went to therapy because him and his brother ran for the same office against each other and it kind of fucked their relationship with each other, at least for a bit (idk their personal lives so idk if they talk now but they do follow each other on twitter)\n\n\n2 of my friends are in therapy, 1 of them has been in therapy, for Suicidal thoughts/attempts",

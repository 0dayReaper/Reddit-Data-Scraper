    "postText": "No, I'm not going to say what it is, but I can't wait, and not in a good way. I said 'probably' because it's a 50/50 chance, and it might end up not happening at all, but I hate thinking about that, and this isn't what this is about. Anyway, It was supposed to happen this September, but it got moved to November and when I heard that it got moved, I felt so frustrated. Like, let it happen already! I am so ready for it. I think about it everyday.\r  \n\r  \nI'm tired of waiting! I was already coping with September... and now NOVEMBER?! I wish I could lock my bedroom door and straight up hibernate until November. I tried distracting myself but it is IMPOSSIBLE. I can't stop thinking about it. I have to endure the pain of waiting for 2 more months. How do I fast forward time? Anyone? No one? Ok. This is going to be me for the next 4 months then. Loop life for 4 months, until it probably happens. Oh how I hate using 'probably' when I talk about this.",

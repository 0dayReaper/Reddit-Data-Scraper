I generally avoid it because I didn't know them personally but in the cases of Robin Williams, Carrie Fisher, Chester Bennington, Michael Clarke Duncan, and now sadly, Grant Imahara, sometimes it just hits you.\n\n\nAdam, if you're still lurking around reddit these days and see this, I'm sorry for your loss. You and Grant were the top Busters. And Buster, of course.",

You could also get neurological dysfunctions from an aneurysm. \n\nHowever the likelihood of developing a stroke or a rupture is higher while coughing sneezing or blowing ones nose. \n\nSo yeah it could be connected medically. Not sure if that is the case with him though.",

His muscles are all he needs ooooooooh).\n\nAnd then suddenly, he has a brain aneurysm and then he fell off the stairs. He will literally die BEFORE HE HIT THE GROUND.",

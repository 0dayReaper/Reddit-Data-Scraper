He discovers that not only was his boss in the Secret Service in on the plot, but the First Lady had ordered the whole thing due to an extramarital affair. In the end, he decides that protecting the dead President's reputation was more important than implicating FLOTUS, so he covers it up.\n\nTo be fair, the movie End Game has been out since 2006.  It honestly wasn't that great.",

Everyone was paying attention to an incredibly boring CBRN class. \n\nIt only sucked that he spoiled it at the end of his class for us anyway. Some people get off on ruining things for others.

We left off on a cliffhanger where he was about to efficiently cultivate a field of parsley and potatoes, all while managing a massive number of high status connections across the town. The result being able to buy large shipments of rutabaga seed at a whopping 90 percent discount (almost beating out the profit margin of the legendary schrute farms). The sequel, Avengers: this is not a game, will release in August of 2020 and will be a 65 hour long  psa on the environmental impact that small cats have on global climate change, all while wrapping up the remaining plot threads of endgame. Also tony becomes president and at the end of his two very efficient terms he is able to lower the rate of all std\u2019s by a record breaking 58.3 percent, and is able to cut the U.S\u2019s inefficient military funding and redirect it towards a plethora of different causes, most notably spreading awareness and ease of care regarding mental health in America.",

The veins were so perfectly done I couldn\u2019t even tell his cock wasn\u2019t real.\n\nAnother thing I found weird was when Black Panther broke the fourth wall and gave the audience the n-word pass. I did appreciate it, but it would feel more in place in a Deadpool movie.\n\nOverall, it was still excellent, but I think that they definitely need to reconsider some things.",

HOWEVER, the only times I\u2019ve felt someone was bad at it was if they were doing something unnatural or awkward, such as going very fast, moving very robotically(just like left right left right with their tongue or something), or like having their mouth wide open. I think the main thing is to let it be organic and sensual and not harsh, stiff and robotic.",

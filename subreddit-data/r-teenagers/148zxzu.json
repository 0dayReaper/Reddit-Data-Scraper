    "postText": "I took a photo of my classmate with a vape\n\nAfter school on Monday, I (13M) was walking home with my other friends (12M and 13M). We were at a bus stop and suddenly one of my classmates (13F) came bragging to her friends about a vape. She states in these words I quote,\n\u201cIf any of you snitch that I\u2019m vaping, I\u2019ll fuck you up.\u201d\n\nI decided to take advantage of this and I took a photo of her holding the vape in her hand. I took at least 3 pictures. 2 have her holding the vape but her face isn\u2019t shown. She\u2019s slightly overweight so I took a 3rd picture of her face which hopefully showed proof that it was her. She immediately caught onto to what I was doing and got mad. I want to snitch but I will admit that I\u2019ve done some messed up things as well. One time, I insulted her weight when she made me mad in a group chat and it\u2019s been screenshotted. If I report my evidence of her vaping, I may get in trouble as well for being \u2018fatphobic\u2019 despite me making the immature joke many months ago. What do I do? Continue to blackmail her with the photos or snitch immediately",

You say she hates you for no reason, but im not exactly fond of people who make fun of me either. and let's say she didn't like you beforehand either, your actions DEFINITELY haven't given her reason to like you, nor have they proven to me why she would like you in the first place. just because you focus in class, stay out of trouble, that doesn't mean you should rat out everyone else.",

It has an 8\u201d diameter which is around medium-large but you don\u2019t need that big a telescope for the moon. I got a big one because I also like deep-sky objects, which is anything outside of our solar system (galaxies, nebulas, etc.)\n\nLet me know if you\u2019re curious about anything else!\n\nEdit: For those who are curious, [here](https://www.celestron.com/blogs/knowledgebase/the-ultimate-guide-to-celestron-optical-tubes) is some great info on all three main types of telescopes",

It's an impact basin right around 420 km in diameter! It wasn't sampled by the Apollo Program, so we don't know how old it is, but it was considered as a landing sight for the last Apollo mission in 1972, Apollo 17. Based on observations though, we believe it could be right around 3.9 billion years old. It's also filled with a 3 km thick layer of basalt! \n\nMare Humorum is actually very interesting to scientists because it can tell us about thermal evolution of that specific area of the Moon, and could give us clues about whether or not the Moon had some form of plate tectonics at one point, and how volcanically active the Moon was! Overall a great picture, you should do more!",

Same thing happened when I learned HTML\n\nI tried telling him I was interested in electrical engineering and he just shut down those dreams too. \n\nI got certified for Network Pro and it\u2019s one of my biggest accomplishments, and yet he basically tells me it isn\u2019t worth anything, when it\u2019s basically on level with the CompTia N+. \n\n\nThen he asks me why I\u2019m so negative all the time and don\u2019t want to \u201cspend time with the family\u201d.\n\nEdit 1: Rip my inbox. \n\nSome more info: Networking makes more money than electrical engineering, and is less dangerous. Hence why I want to do it as a job. I would still like to learn some electrical even as a hobby however.",

            "comment": "A few years ago, my mother moved out of the state with my younger sister while I stayed with my dad. I only get to see my mom and sister a few times a year. It really sucks trying to be a teenager and getting by without my mom at my side. I've gotten pretty used to it by now since it's been about two and a half years since then but it still bothers me to some extent.\n\nI visited her this Christmas to spend time with her. I though the first few days were fine but that's because we were setting up things for Christmas. A few days after that I was staying with her and my sister at her house. So I thought this would be a good time to get to know my mom a lil more. However, she hasn't asked me shit about how I've been or how highschool is going since I got here. When ever I try to go talk to her she shrugs off whatever I say and shoots me down for the things I enjoy. \n\nAt this point I don't think she likes me. We went out for a dinner with an old friend of hers so they could catch up. Her friend asked her why she moved and my mom responded with \"I left everything that annoyed me being.\" ThAnKs mOM.",

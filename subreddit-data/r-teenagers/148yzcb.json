I dont like using this word, but she was just a straight-up whore. I know for a fact that she slept with three different guys on my floor alone (in the span of 3 days), not to mention where else she went. She was kind of flirty with me and I did almost end up messing around with her which excited me cause I was a horny 18 year old virgin at the time, but I'm very glad I didn't. \n\nAnyways, on her snap stories, she would CONSTANTLY post about how \"I'm so pretty\" and \"I'm so good at tricking guys into sleeping with me\" and all I could think was \"Girl, you offered to fuck a bunch of horny college freshmen, you didn't trick them, you gave them exactly what they wanted\". I'm sure it sounds like a misogynistic rant from an outside perspective but this girl was actually delusional.",

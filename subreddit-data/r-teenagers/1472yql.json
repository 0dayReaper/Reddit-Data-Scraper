    "postText": "when i was younger n i had my meltdowns/breakdowns whatever they call them..  (i had rly bad mood issues and felt like i couldn't control it, i got rly upset over little things all the time) my dad would always threaten tk \"tear my ass up\" n stuff like that n he always thought it was a behavioral problem and was always mad ad me ... i dont remember much of my childhood but i do have memories of him hitting me when i was having a meltdown n getting mad at me. even though i did other stuff like flap my hands, was rly shy and couldnt make friends, never made eye contact, lined up crayons, didnt like hugs, hated when plans were changed  etc.  he still thought it was a behavioural problem. i got diagnosed with dmdd which is a mood disorder and my mom was the only one to actually care abt me and check for disorders. im getting tested for autism in a few months and if i am autistic its rly gonna be extra fucked up what he always did",

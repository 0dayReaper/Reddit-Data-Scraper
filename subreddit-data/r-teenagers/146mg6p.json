Cover-ups we\u2019re shown to span 8 decades at the least. Just between 1950 and 2002, 4% of catholic priests in the US were accused. Of course 4% doesn\u2019t sound like a big number, but when there are nearly 40,000 of them (a number which has decreased by more than half over the last 5 decades) it\u2019s an insane amount statistically speaking. Also, we must consider that sexual assaults are by far the most underreported crime and in the case of priests that could also be exacerbated by the fact that they were being systematically cycled around so that they wouldn\u2019t face the consequences of their actions.",

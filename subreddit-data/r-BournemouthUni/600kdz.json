It's not amazing TBH but when it comes to looking at Universities it's worth looking at it as it might improve more in a few years. Keep your options open though and also consider Computer Science / Software Engineering at other unis.",

It also depends if you want to go into Programming or the Tech side (Modelling, level design etc.). But they basically teach you how to make games with little to no knowledge.",

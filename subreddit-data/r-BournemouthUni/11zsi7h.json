    "postText": "Hey there,\n\nI am first year student conducting a survey on loneliness and social isolation experienced by university students. As a former/current student, your experiences and perspectives are invaluable to us, and we would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to complete the survey.\n\nThe survey is anonymous and should take no more than 3 minutes to complete. Your responses will help us better understand the prevalence and impact of loneliness and social isolation on students, and ultimately, improve the university experience for everyone.\n\nHere's the link to the survey:\u00a0[https://forms.office.com/e/Zw3pPF770j](https://forms.office.com/e/Zw3pPF770j)\n\nWe would also appreciate it if you could share the survey with your friends or on your social media to help us gather a diverse range of perspectives.\n\nThank you so much for your time and contribution to our research.",

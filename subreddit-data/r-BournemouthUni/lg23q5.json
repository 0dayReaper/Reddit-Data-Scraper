    "postText": "Looking to meet new friends, and discuss a different topic every month?\n\nPodcast Brunch Club is like book club, but for podcasts. We'd love to have you join us.\n\nSign up here for all the information about the Bournemouth chapter of Podcast Brunch Club: [http://podcastbrunchclub.com/in-person/bournemouth](http://podcastbrunchclub.com/in-person/bournemouth). We are having meetings via video call until in-person meetings are viable again.\n\nPBC is a global community with local chapters all over the world. Every month 3-5 podcast episodes are curated into a thematic list that is sent out by newsletter. People listen in their own time and then meet to discuss. It's all free. It's simply a way to make podcast listening less solitary.\n\nYou don't have to listen to all the episodes to join in the conversation, and you're always welcome to invite a friend.\n\nHappy listening!",

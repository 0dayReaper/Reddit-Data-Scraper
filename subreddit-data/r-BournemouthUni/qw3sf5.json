    "postText": "Hi there,\n\nI\u2019m a researcher at the University of Edinburgh &amp; we are currently recruiting participants for a research project focusing on young people\u2019s digital wellbeing.\n\n**We want to amplify the voices of diverse young people aged 16-24 years, currently living in the UK, to share their experiences of seeking support in the digital world through an** **anonymous** **online survey. Everyone who takes part is offered the chance to win a \u00a315 high street gift voucher.**\n\nThis project is really important, as we want to hear directly from young people themselves about their experiences and what their preferences would be for developing the best possible support for all young people.\n\n**Link to participate:** [**https://edinburgh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_djo8nFGlvK83VpI**](https://edinburgh.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_djo8nFGlvK83VpI)\n\nFor further info about this project, check out our website: [https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/digital/](https://blogs.ed.ac.uk/digital/) \n\nThank you in advance!",

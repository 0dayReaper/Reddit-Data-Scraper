    "postText": "I plan to go to BU for uni next year to do an undergraduate in communications and media. Is this a good uni to study at for that degree? and is this a degree worth taking?Also, can any current students or already graduated people give me honest options on the uni please. It can be on anything and everything, from (communications and media) lessons, how the uni handled covid, to nightlife, the community and getting a job while in uni/after uni. \n\nFurthermore, how much of the student population is international students and finally, is halal meat easily accessible in Bournemouth? \n\nApologies for so many questions, just answer as much as you can",

There are quite a few International students this year (myself included) but you will rarely encounter them unless you attend meetings/hangouts. \n3. There is a club/society for faith so that may be useful when you enrol.\n4. I do psychology but I have one tip for you - don't give up. 1st semester they test the waters- it will be slow and may be hard to adapt. It's a good university. Clean, inclusive, respectful. \n5. We have a whole website dedicated to placements: jobs&amp;volunteering - during and after studies. There really is a lot. And international students get special notifications from the international department about job opportunities, support meetings for CV, and etc. \n\n It is really good.  Don't rely too much on people. Lecturers change all the time and your peers might not be of the same opinion as you. \n\n But it is really good.   Hope that helps :))",

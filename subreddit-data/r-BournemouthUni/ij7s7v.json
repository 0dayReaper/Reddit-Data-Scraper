    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m a new graduate student who is going to be living in the Village accommodation. I was wondering how strict the policies are for overnight visitors, in your experiences. I had wanted to have my sister come visit with me over her 2 week holiday, but just read the rules saying 2 nights max. Is this very strictly implemented? \nI wouldn\u2019t want to get in trouble or make people uncomfortable but I would really like to have her visit.\n\nAnyway thank you!",

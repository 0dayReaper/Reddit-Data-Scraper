    "postText": "Hello everyone, I just wanted an informed opinion from the people of this group. I recently got an admission confirmation from the Bournemouth University for their MSc in International Management. So I had a few questions.\n\n1)How is the teaching?\n2)How is the placement scenario?\n3)Is the course worth it?\n4)How is the ROI(Return on Investment?)\n5)How is the living standard there?\n6)What is the average salary/package of MSc graduates?\n7)Will the Brexit adversely affect the international students who are there on a Tier 4 visa?\n\nPlease feel free to get back to me as per your convenience.\n\nP.S: My joining is in Feb 2020.\n\nThanks and best regards.",

Mine ends in May 2021, and I still am unsure.",

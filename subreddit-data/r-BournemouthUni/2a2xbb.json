I learnt Java and HTML, nothing really difficult but any knowledge on any programming language is good :) \n\nI didn't find it that challenging because it was really similar to my college BTEC (though at a higher level) but if you haven't done any of the units before it has the ability to be very challenging, there are a lot of new concepts. \n\nWe did units to do with Relational Databases, Business, Web Dev, Systems Analysis and Design, Programming, Computers and Networks (I think that's it, I'll post again if I remember any more) :) \n\nIs that you covered?

I did ccna 1,2 and 3 at college as well as programming and Web so I slacked a lot in the first year. During your first year everyone takes the same course.  Second year you get some options with what to take but still have compulsory bits,  (I HAD to take Web or programming) it was probably my least favourite year as some compulsory stuff can get a bit heavy especially when you don't have much interest in it. \n\nThird year is placement so is working an independent job for a year. \n\n4th year you can specialise completely. It was my favourite year but hooooly shit writing a dissertation is the hardest thing you will ever do. It's a culmination of knowledge,  time management and ability to find information yourself. \n\nThe hardest thing about uni is learning that people aren't going to do it for you.  The lecturers are there to help when you ask and will go out of their way if needed but they won't come to you asking if you need help,  the onus is on you to ask",

You get to pick the subject so make sure you have interest in what you pick. Word of advice is take a Subject with a decent amount on it that you can finish in 6 weeks.  Despite having 12 weeks to do it. You will have holdups and setbacks that will take you to the full 12 weeks.\n\nIndependence is pretty easy.  If you're in student flats at the start just make sure to be as social during freshers as you can, its harder to make friends one people have got their social groups after the first few weeks once everyone had social  although uni isn't like school or college and you don't really get cliques and most people are pretty friendly. \n\nBest advice I can give you for financing is take out a months budget and split it between 4 envelopes so you know exactly how much you have to spend each week and dint go over it. Although I would recommend getting a student overdraft.  I think co-op I s the biggest at \u00a32000 but it depends how much you want to spend. I worked night shift at sainsburys 2 night a week and had \u00a3500 a month extra to play with\n\n",

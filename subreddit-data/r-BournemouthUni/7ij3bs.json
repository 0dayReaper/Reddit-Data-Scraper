    "postText": "Hello!\nI'm 17 years old and am currently in my second year, of a 2 year Level 3 UAL Extended Diploma in Computer Games Design. I'm very interested in applying for the Computer Animation Art and Design course at Bournemouth University and have heard a lot of good things about it, and the surrounding area as a whole. I was wondering if anyone that is currently, or previously, studying this specific course can give me any honest insight as to what they think of said course, and of Bournemouth University as a whole. I've also read that during the application process of the three animation courses, you have to partake in a maths test of some kind. Is this still the case as of 2018, or specifically with the course that I'm looking at applying for? \nThanks in advance!",

I worked on the applicant days this year and there was no mention of any of the three tests I myself had to take for entrance to the course; starting this year the courses were redesigned so it would make sense that the interview process would be too. Hope this helps! ",

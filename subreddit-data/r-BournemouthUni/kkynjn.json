I'm having a bit of difficulty in finding an accommodation with reasonable budget and the ones in spare room are a bit expensive. I was wondering if you have any tips on finding renters directly who are willing to rent a room in Bournemouth. My budget would be less than 350 pounds if possible. So if you have any idea on this it would be very helpful for me. Thanks in advance :)",

We still need undergraduate autistic students, and undergraduate students who do not have autism to help with my PhD research project.\n\nIf you are an undergraduate student in the UK, do complete the confidential survey by visiting:\n\n[https://warwick.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_1Bzap0RyFKEZd3M](https://warwick.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Bzap0RyFKEZd3M)\n\nAny responses I get will be much appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance.",

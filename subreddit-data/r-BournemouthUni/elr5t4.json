    "postText": "Hi. I am an OU student doing Computing and IT, which is quite broad as far as course content, which has been equally interesting and a struggle. I was excited to see the game focussed degrees at BU. Anyone here taking or taken the course? What are your thoughts on it?\n\nAlso, as an older person (36/7), are there any mature students who can give me their input into being at Uni? I am considering going to an undergrad open day, what sort of things happen?\n\nMany thanks.",

It's very much what you make of it, the standards of teaching vary pretty wildly but if you know what you're doing, this isn't too much of an issue. Some of my course-mates were amazing at what they did and put a lot of effort into their work whilst others did the bare minimum and had very little skill but due to the pretty lax marking standards, got through with a decent grade anyway.   \nThe uni itself is really good, great facilities and they're putting a lot of effort into modernising the campus. I did an open day when I first joined and it's pretty standard stuff, there is a schedule with different course talks going on and you just attend whatever talks interest you to find out about that course.   \nIf you have any other questions just ask and I'll do my best to answer.",

I mostly know Java but have done bits with Python, CSS/Javascript, XML etc.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, did you find the course gave you the ability to access a good industry after completion? For one reason or another I'm playing catch up by about 15 years, so I'd like to think I can still be a good employee for somebody in 4 years time.",

They teach you the basics but expect to have to do a lot in your own time if you want to make a career out of it.   \nIt honestly depends. In Bournemouth specifically, there's a shortage of skilled software devs so finding a job isn't too difficult. I had my post-uni job sorted before I'd handed my dissertation in. A few of my close course mates have gone on to work at top games companies, others in more commercial fields like training software and I've ended up in doing software engineering for a global company. If you were looking for a job elsewhere, you might struggle with more competition.",

            "comment": "Hey. I'm an international student currently doing the Games Design course. Like what Hitch\\_en said, it's alright. Teaching quality varies where some are really good, and some not so much. They do teach you the basics of things but you're mostly expected to develop your skills by yourself. Occasionally you'll have guest lectures from industry people who'll provide tips on employment and things like that so far (which I find useful). The uni offers an optional placement year but it's very competitive. I do not have too many details about this as I've not reached that stage of my course yet.\n\nFacility wise it's good. Next month they're going to dedicate this entire building for our faculty and they have some pretty neat equipment there. It looks quite modern and clean, and they're planning to put some strict regulations to ensure that only we (from this faculty) get to use that building, and that quality remains consistent. \n\nI do know one mature student in my course and they seem to have the same opinion as well so far. I've met other mature students (international) from other courses and they seem to like the uni and don't feel alienated due to their age or anything like that. \n\nI hope this helps!",

Is it the course content, perhaps it's boring or hard to see the importance of some subject?\n\nI wonder could you tell me what a normal week looks like for you studying? As I'm only part time at the moment studying from home, I have fears about adapting to full time study. I gather from some youtube videos you have some lectures during a week, then class/lab time and a large portion is self-study? How many hours do you think you study per week?\n\nSorry, but what is a faculty exactly? Is it all students on similar courses, or this course?\n\nThanks for your input it's been really helpful. I just need to write some sort of personal statement in three days, which I've never done before.",

                            "comment": "Thing is all the tutors are well knowledgeable in whatever they're teaching. But not all of them are capable of conveying it well, so it comes off as very mundane or boring.\nAlso one of my units wasn't handled well and one of our assignments wasn't very beginner friendly, despite the course mentioning that we don't need any experience. But luckily they take feedback quite seriously and so they cancelled that assignment with no consequences and said they'll rework it for next year's students.\n\nSo in my timetable I've got at least 1 lecture per day that lasts an hour. I would say I have lab sessions thrice a week and they usually last for 2 hours. But yes most of your hours are dedicated to self study, but I find the units that have labs very time consuming that I barely get the chance to do some personal research (like if I'm interested in some topic or I'd like to practice modelling something by myself). This may not be the same case for everyone though. I know some people who do part time. Some are able to manage their academics, while some lag behind. Also if you have checked the course content on the website, the units presented per year is actually divided into semesters (which I didn't know before joining) . So there's 3 units per semester.\n\nJust for reference I don't do part time, but I can go about 4-5 hours on regular study but ngl when I first started with assignments, I used to work on them on an average of 10 hours per day for a couple of weeks (this is mostly because I was inexperienced) but I've improved over time and don't study like that anymore (I wouldn't recommend it either haha).\n\nA faculty is basically a field of subjects! So games design comes under something called Science and Technology. So you have other games courses, music, and TV too I think, and some others. It's a word you'll often hear be thrown around from programme leaders and the sort.\n\nGlad I helped ! I'm happy to answer more questions if you have any. :)",

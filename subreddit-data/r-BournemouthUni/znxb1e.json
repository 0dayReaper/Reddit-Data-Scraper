    "postText": "I'm 25 and left Bournemouth 2 years ago to live in Oxford. I miss the south coast so very much! To me it's like my home, although I only first moved there when I  was 17! I know the whole of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole very well as I studied, lived and worked across this area. I loved it! I made fantastic friends and mentors from the university allowed me the opportunity to be where I am today.\n\nOutside of this I just loved the landscape and sea and sand and all that shi\\*t!.\n\nI miss the beach, surrounding landscape, social life, university, Buffalo Bar, cannabis\\*, air festival and the summer fireworks!\n\nI miss it so much!\n\nIf it wasn't for my very best friends here in oxford, I'd quit my course and slip back to Bournemouth in a heartbeat!\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else here misses Bournemouth this much?!\n\n... Or just me feeling this unjustly!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*exceptionally prompt delivery and never any scarcity of product. A+++ stuff! --  Oxford is a bit shit when it comes to the premium narcotics!",

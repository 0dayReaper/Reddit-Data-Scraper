    "postText": "I'm an international student for Bournemouth University and my flight is in about 2 weeks for now. I already have accommodation booked for the year at one of the student halls but my tenancy starts on the 4th of September. My flight is for the 19th of August and I thought I'd be able to find accommodation to stay at till I can move to the student hall I already have a contract with. However no one is looking to rent a room to me for such a short period. Everyone is asking for long term contracts of three months or more. I've looked on every platform from spare room to Rightmove and even gumtree. I had one lady selling me hopes of renting to me but she gave the room to someone else this morning so I'm back to square one.  \n\nThis my last resort and I'm hoping I can find someone willing to have me for about three weeks. I'd be out before the third week is over. I really just need a place to stay till the 4th of September. I'm 27, don't smoke, don't have any pets and I don't have a car. I'd be willing to pay for the time I'd be spending of course. Please send me a message if you'd be willing to have me over. I'd appreciate it a lot. \n\nCheers.",

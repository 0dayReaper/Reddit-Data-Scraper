            "comment": "I've got a calculator I use to have a running estimate for my grade. Just divide your results by 10, then times the answer by whatever percentage it's worth in the unit. Add the scores together to get your overall grade for each unit, add them together and divide by the number of units you have to get the average, and that should be your final grade\n\nWorked for my first year, I was 0.05% off the actual grade they calculated so it's pretty accurate. You can crunch the numbers yourself pretty easily, even with a pen and paper",

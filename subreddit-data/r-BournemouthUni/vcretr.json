    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI hope it is okay to post this here. I am currently working on my MA Political Psychology at BU and am desperately looking for more participants for my research. The questionnaire should only take 10 minutes to fill out and looks into decision making and online petitions in specific environmental petitions. The only requirement is that you are at least 16. \n\nHere is the link to my survey: [https://bournemouthpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_bC5yp5CQcum6kGW](https://bournemouthpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bC5yp5CQcum6kGW)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so so much in advance :)",

These will be sources that lay the ground work for the subject of the essay, and two or three are usually provided explicitly or mentioned in some way. First year this was often textbooks as well as journals for my course, but could be different for yours.\n\nIf you correctly use all of the expected sources and your essay has no major structuring or spelling/grammar mistakes you will be on track for a 2:2. To achieve a higher grade you need to do your own research - read around the subject of the essay and bring in effective points, support, and/or criticism from other authors.",

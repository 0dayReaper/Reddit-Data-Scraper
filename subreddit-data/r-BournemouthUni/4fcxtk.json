I'm from London and am slightly more inclined towards the drum and bass/raving scene and was wondering if Bournemouth has much to offer in this way? \nAlso any comments/advice about b'mouth nightlife in general would be much appreciated!",

In my opinion cameo is kinda a bad club as it's mainly just the same playlist with club bangers every week.\n\nHaving said that the uni nightclub fire station, which is close to halls assuming you're living there first year, is good sometimes.\n\nDrum and bass nights do happen but you need to take them as they come. Hospitality played at halo last year and there were a couple of decent drum and bass nights. \n\nOverall good uni good nightlife would reccomend",

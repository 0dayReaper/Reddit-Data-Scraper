    "postText": "\nCan anyone tell me my overall grade for one unit that has 3 assignments? The weighting is a bit confusing.  \n\nThere are three assigments but two of them are combined. The unit is split 50/50 50% for one piece of coursework and 50% for weekly tests and a piece of writing. \n\nThe weighting for these two:\nCriteria 1: weekly tests worth 80%\nCriteria 2:  short piece of writing worth 20%\n\nGrades are 60% for A1\nGrades 2/3 are 73% and 100% respectively. (74% for the tests and 100% for the written work. \n\nThe unit is worth 20 credits.",

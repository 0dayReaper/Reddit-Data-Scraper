The overal module grade is 20 credits.\nAssignment 1 worth 50% with a score of 57%\nAssignment 2 worth 50% now these were combined 28.33% and 100%\nI know there's calcs and stuff available but how do you calculate when the assignments are combined?\nAssignment 2 can be broken down as 80% and 20% respectively. but together these assignments are worth 50% each if that makes sense",

My mark was 57/100. \nThe second two are complicated: it's worth 50%   \nCriteria one is worth 80% (the weekly tests) scoring overal 28.33%\nCriteria 2 is worth 20% scoring 100/100. its kinda confusing how they've done this.",

So you multiply these together 50x57 =2850.\nThen do the same for the others:\nA2 = 40% and score =28.33   So 40x28.3 =1133.2\nA3 =10% and score =100   So 10x100 = 1000\nThen add all up: 2850+1133.2+1000 = 4983.2\nThen divide by 100 to get your grade for the whole unit: = 49.8",

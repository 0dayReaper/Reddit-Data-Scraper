I was wondering if anyone here has experience in obtaining a scholarship, Bournemouth or otherwise, and if so if you could offer any tips on the application process.\n\nAdditionally, I would reallyy appreciate it if you guys could take a look at a brief overview of my resume...\n\n- Brazilian\n- T-Level in Marketing;\n- 1st class undergraduate degree in Marketing and Advertising in one of the best LATAM universities (so far. I still have a year left)\n- 2 years of work experience (USA, Argentina, and Brazil);\n- T-shaped career.\n\nI think my resume would be good if I were applying for a LATAM university scholarship. Still, I am wondering if my resume is sufficient to qualify for the Bournemouth university's requirements.\n\nLastly, I am an autodidact and have not had formal English language instruction, and my English level is C1. Do you believe this is something worth mentioning in my application?\n\nThank you sooo much for reading it, I know it was a big text \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udde1",

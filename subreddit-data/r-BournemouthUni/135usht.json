    "postText": "Hello. I am an international student from Pakistan and have applied in the course MA in 3D Animation at Bournemouth University back in FEB 2023 via Agent of ABN Education.\n\nSince then, I have not received any updates regarding my application and my agent keeps telling me my application is \"in process\".\n\nHonestly, I'm a little suspecious at this point if my agent even applied. Is there anyone at the university I can contact and ask about my application. I tried their contact page but there is an enquiry form I had to fill (Which i did). \n\nLike I said, I have recieved no email from Bournemouth University on my personal email and don't even know my application ID or number.\n\nAny guide or suggestions is appreciated. Bournemouth University is my priority and I don't want to accept any other offer out of haste and regret.",

Now, IDK how long it will be \"in process\". The worst part is I don't even know the application ID so I could follow up on my own.  \n\n\nSigh, I think I made a mistake getting the agent involved.",

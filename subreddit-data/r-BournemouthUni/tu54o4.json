    "postText": "\nI plan to go to BU for uni next year to do an undergraduate in criminology. Is this a good uni to study at for that degree? and is this a degree worth taking?Also, can any current students or already graduated people give me honest options on the uni please. It can be on anything and everything, from lessons, how the uni handled covid, to nightlife, the community and getting a job while in uni/after uni. \n\nAnd finally, is nice vegan food easily accessible in Bournemouth?",

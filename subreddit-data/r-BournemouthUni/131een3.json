I\u2019ve never been to England at all and I am wondering if you guys have any recommendations for areas to look for accommodations? I was thinking to look for private housing and not go in one of the university accommodations. Is this something that other graduate students also do? Or if anybody knows a good website to look for accommodations or neighborhoods where graduate students often live? Any advice would be super helpful",

    "postText": "I\u2019m choosing my accommodation in June and I was wondering what the best accommodation was? I\u2019m preferably looking for one that comes with a double bed/ bigger bed than a single and a good social life area lol. I only had time to look at Bailey point on the open day last week and it was alright but I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any suggestions/ opinions?",

            "comment": "I'm pretty sure that bailey point is the only accommodation from the ones offferd to first years that have a double bed. It's also the nicest but the rest of the accomodations seem pretty similar. I currently live in Purbeck house and it's alright and the rooms are pretty big. If I were gonna choose now id probably pick student village but you have to share a bathroom and if you really like going to the club I would probably stay in landsdowne aswell. In my opinion most of the accomodations are pretty similar so you won't get completely fucked one way or another",

We both have small double beds and a good social life. Overall ,I\u2019ve had a nice stay at Oxford point this year.\nDon\u2019t expect it to get better then Bailey point tho so keep ur standers lower.",

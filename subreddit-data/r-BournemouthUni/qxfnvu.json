If so, you can use your experience to help other students just like you - and have a chance to win a \u00a325 voucher in the process! All you need to do is fill out the quick survey below about your experiences as an international student - all your responses will remain entirely confidential and anonymous and will only be used for research. Many thanks and hope you're having a great day! \n\nhttps://form.typeform.com/to/WgBbMkSF?typeform-source=www.google.com",

After hundreds of miles and months of traveling insanity I guess I just accepted it the second time. \nIt\u2019s not as bad as you would think. There isn\u2019t any room for error but the same can be said for spots on roads in Colorado (Blanca/Little bear approach, old shelf road, and some spots up by the San Juan\u2019s) \nSlow and steady wins the race. The objective is to arrive at your destination relatively intact. \nWhen I was there the traffic was being controlled at checkpoints. One direction allowed at a time.",

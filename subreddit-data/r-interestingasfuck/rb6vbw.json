Also, the ornamentation on the legs looks like it was a hole cut out with a router template and then an insert was glued in with a dowel running down the length of it. I don't think any of that is detail chisel work. Those circles are definitely cut with some kind of tool. It doesn't take anything away from the accomplishment, but it definitely looks like there was a router used in several places. Routers cause tear out, which will definitely give it a rougher surface.",

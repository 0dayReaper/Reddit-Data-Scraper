Used to see our friends every week for about ten years and it felt a lot like this video. Now we have a toddler. Parenting seriously complicates social occasions and now we see them every couple of months. Thankfully some of them also have small children so we can do the occasional play date. But our son has a lot of honorary aunts and uncles, so it's at least not a total drought. Just hard to plan things around a nap time from noon-3pm and an 8pm bedtime. \n\nI miss those nights, but wouldn't trade what we have to get them back.",

A group (4) of us each have our own kids that are about the same age that have known each other since they were babies. We try to see each other as much as possible and try to do vacations as well. It\u2019s tough as the kids (middle school now) have more and more of their own activities going on. It\u2019s nice to see the kids have their own group chats and side chats and dynamics and that they are actually friends. But yeah I wouldn\u2019t trade it but definitely have fond memories of those times and miss them.",

The most serious complications involve the heart and aorta, with an increased risk of mitral valve prolapse and aortic aneurysm. The lungs, eyes, bones, and the covering of the spinal cord are also commonly affected. The severity of the symptoms is variable.",

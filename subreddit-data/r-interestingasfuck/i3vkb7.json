We replied and expressed our sympathy and explained to him that all of our wedding contracts are non-refundable. He kept emailing us trying to get a refund and we kept reiterating that the contract is non-refundable. We eventually stopped responding since the issue was moot.\u201d\n\n&gt;On May 23, which would have been Montney and Wyatt\u2019s wedding, Copper Stallion took a moment to revel on Facebook, in a post captured by Denver7:  \u201cToday would have been the day where we would have filmed Justin and Alexis' wedding. After what Justin pulled with the media stunt to try and shake us down for a refund we hope you sob and cry all day for what would have been your wedding day.\u201d\n\nHis comments speak for themselves.",

Except for that one that stuck himself in a building for like 50 years. \n\nBut thinking back on that there's no way the living tissue part of that terminator would survive sitting still for that long either lol",

I think Jordan is the only Arab country where homosexuality is legal (since 1951) but only 20% of the population thinks it should be accepted.

The minerals in granite are definitely harder than those in limestone, feldspar and especially quartz being significantly harder than carbonate minerals and this plays a role in resisting erosion by physical processes. \n\nRain is naturally acidic and becomes even more so with all of the chemicals we're pumping into the atmosphere.  Even a gentle rain will begin to erode limestone and marble over time. Couple that with the lower hardness and you get a rock that degrades much more quickly than a granite.\n\nQuartz and feldspar don't chemically break down as easily.  This is especially true for quartz which is why you find quartz sand beaches many places.  During transport from source rocks to depositional areas (often via rivers) the feldspar will eventually break down into clays by first being broken up by physical processes and then broken down further by chemical processes. Quartz is harder and much more chemically resistant so by the time these grains have traveled from mountain to beach a you have left are sand sized particles of quartz (this is a very simplified example).\n\nThe type of laser engraving you're talking is extremely superficial and is easy to remove via erosion. Carbonated like limestone of marble are soft enough to engrave deeply which means even with erosion via chemical and physical processes the overall text is going to remain legible for a long time.  You can achieve the same results with granite it's just a more difficult process.  \n\nAs far as sealants go it's mostly to protect the granites from staining. They have low porosity but it's still there and you don't want a stain in your expensive counter tops. \n\nI suppose this is a long winded way to say density =/= hardness but I'm a geologist who spent nearly a decade cutting lots of different kinds of rocks and I like to get technical sometimes.",

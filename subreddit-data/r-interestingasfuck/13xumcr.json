They did have traditional hobbies such as playing instruments, playing with cards, playing together (monks do in fact enjoy playing sports) and even knit, you may find these boring, but in other times those were things you could do after a hard, backbreaking jobs to relax.\n\nHardly any time to think about touching themselves!",

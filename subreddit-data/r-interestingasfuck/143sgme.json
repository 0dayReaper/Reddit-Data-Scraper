If anything, many copper-based products were worse than traditional antifoulings, and quite considerably so. What I mean by \u2018worse\u2019, is quicker onset of growth and a also a denser amount of weed, barnacles and sea squirts. Whenever a copper coated boat was lifted out, whoever\u2019s turn it was on the pressure washer knew they were in for a *long* and dirty time under there!\n\nMost vessels I saw that had it applied had maybe one or two seasons of acceptable protection before they were horrendous. As regulation of the products changed, demanding less and less concentration of copper in the products, the performance of the coating reduced as well, as expected. \n\nThat said, I only dealt with vessels in the private sector and some small commercial vessels, so there is every chance that products used on large vessels like the one in this video may be different and perform better, but I doubt it.",

The smell is terrible and you end the day with that stuff covering you from head to foot. I didn\u2019t work on Tankers like this ship but the yachts that came in were enough to make me gag. Tankers can take up four days to do from stem to stern but I think they have to breakout the power washers for the stern around the prop.

A fouled hull means more drag and more fuel cost (even a few percent could be 10s of thousands of dollars) thus shippers would want to keep it clean as possible. On the otherhand, yacht owners probably wouldn't take care of it for longer since the boat costs money just sitting there so why dump more money in if you don't have to.",

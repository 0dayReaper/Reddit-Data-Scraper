Cutting my arm off would be effective at alleviating the RSI in my wrist, yet I still have both arms. Does that clarify the difference?\n\nThere's no way to know if The Shining would have been just as good without Kubrick abusing his actors - we only have the outcome where he did. But if you're trying to suggest that no great works of art in any form were borne out of suffering in the pursuit of the art, then you're just not operating in reality.\n\nI'll say it again: The ends not justifying the method does not mean the method is ineffective.

The directors of The Shining took the door out and replaced it with a prop door because they wanted him to get through it at a certain speed. But he actually was so good at tearing doors down due to his time in his Fire Marshall position. So they had to put in a heavier duty slightly reinforced door to slow him down. Lmao\n\nTldr; Jack Nicholson was so good at tearing doors down that he tore down a full sized door in this movie to slow him down a little.",

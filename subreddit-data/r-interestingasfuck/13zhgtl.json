However, the rear steerable roller, due to its small size and the incorrect weight distribution of the machine as a whole, got stuck in soft ground almost immediately after the start of the test. The large wheels were unable to pull it out, despite the use of the most powerful propulsion system at that time, consisting of two captured Maybach engines. These were much more powerful than those used on other tanks of the First World War, having been taken from a damaged German airship. This led to a number of failed tests before the High Commission in August 1915, and in September the project was cancelled. Despite this, Stechkin and Mikulin nevertheless began to develop a new engine (AMBES) for the vehicle. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, as were attempts to move the Tsar Tank from its place and pull it out of the test area. Until 1917, the tank was guarded at the test site, but then, due to the outbreak of the Russian revolution, the vehicle was forgotten. Design work on it was no longer carried out and the huge structure of the vehicle rusted for another 6 years in the forest some 60 kilometres (37 mi) from Moscow until 1923, when the tank was finally dismantled for scrap.",

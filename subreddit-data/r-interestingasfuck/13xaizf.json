The river itself is pretty cool and has some spots to visit if you're ever in the area, most notably the Devil's Whirlpool and the aerial tram over it (iirc that's Canadian side). There are even jetboats which are hella fun, basically a speedboat version of river rafting where you get air over the rapids.\n\nDon't go in the river, bad times.",

I never actually wrote about this lake view. (Haven't written it *yet* therapybrain softly corrects me!)\n\n&gt;Autumn dawns over the Lewiston valley like a slow wave of fire. Trees - birch, maple, oak \u2013 shed their green for earth tones, the amber haze from ripened grass haloing each drifting leaf. Beyond, the Niagara River is a flashing blue. The air is golden and crisp as the earth turns its feet to the sun for the season. \n\n&gt;We follow the road as it descends through this display into the village. As we drive, the sun filters down, shadows shifting across my arms and shoulders. Burdens lower and lift with each tree we pass. I let my eyes drift, blankly watching the sparkling patterns the light leaves on the river. Grandma is in the hospital, again.",

And they weren't on exchange in Toronto, either. The caller asked me if I could transfer them. Unfortunately, no, our phones could not do a transfer to an international phone number, they could only transfer to an internal UofT line. \n\nTl;Dr So, there you go, Toronto and Torino also get mixed up.",

The furthest you can see from the shore of Lake Ontario looking straight from Port Weller to Toronto is about 3 miles. If you\u2019re standing on the top deck of a ship (40ft high) you can see about 9 miles. You need to be standing almost 2000 feet higher than what you\u2019re attempting to directly observe (Toronto) from 45 miles away (the distance between Niagara Falls and Toronto.) \n\nThis is a common effect across the Great Lakes and is usually seen across distances between 40-60 miles, on a clear sunny day. It is a mirage, and interestingly enough, if you could see it from shore to shore, but were on a ship traveling towards Toronto from Port Weller, the city would appear to get ~~larger~~ smaller then slowly disappear below the horizon as you approach, until you could see it by direct observation again. The same effect has been reported from Michigan being able to see the Chicago skyline as well, being over 50 miles away.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a scientist on a research vessel on the Great Lakes, and have actually traveled directly from the exit of the Welland Canal to Toronto.",

Light is bent as it passes through the atmosphere, so what you\u2019re seeing is an effect of the curvature of the Earth. When people see these pictures and seriously claim \u201cflat earth\u201d, scientists silently laugh because the effect actually proves the earth is round-ish. When the moon or sun rise on the horizon, they look absolutely massive, but they aren\u2019t any closer to us than when they\u2019re directly overhead, right? That is the same thing happening, where the light enters the atmosphere, it is spread out over a wider section of the earth, so the moon or sun look much bigger than normal. When they\u2019re overhead, they are sending their light to a much smaller cross section of the atmosphere so they look smaller. \n\nIn-atmo refraction works the same way\u2026 We see things like Toronto from Niagara because Toronto is fricken huge, and produces a LOT of light at night and reflection of light during a sunny day. The light bends over the lake like the trajectory of a bullet, and we see an exaggeratedly large image of the city because the light is being refracted outward in all directions, not just curving down over the lake.",

I can tell you that all 5 lakes are healthier now than they were in the 1970s, but they\u2019re also full of invasive species like zebra mussels and round gobies. \n\nThe problem with mussels is that they remove nutrients from the water column that the lower food web species would generally utilize, but at the same time, they benefit overall lake health because they sequester phosphates, nitrates, carbon, and other chemicals in the sediment. So, on one hand they\u2019re depleting the nutrients of the bigger lakes, making them less biodiverse throughout the food web, but on the other hand, their presence makes Lake Erie almost drinkable again, with much less eutrophication happening year after year, and sequestration of harmful chemicals in the substrate. \n\nThe gobies compete with the native sculpins, and do eat the mussels, but not in nearly enough quantity to make a dent in the population. Alewives were introduced to provide food for the salmon, but native trout can\u2019t eat them, for the same reason that salmon can\u2019t eat goldfish as a staple\u2026 incompatible amino acids in the prey species causes fatty liver disease in the predatory species, leading to death before reproductive age. \n\nNative fish populations are slowly recovering from our overfishing in the mid-late 20th century, but it is a slow process that requires stocking of all the native species - and salmon since they\u2019ve mostly failed to reproduce successfully in this environment. \n\nWe find a lot of healthy copepods and mysis shrimp in our surveys, so the lower food web in most of the lakes is doing alright\u2026 Superior is still the healthiest lake, partially because all water from of the great lakes flows OUT of superior, but also because of the granite - not limestone like the others - bottom. The depth and extreme cold also helps Superior resist infiltration from the invading species, as it takes a long time for the epilimnion to warm up in summer, and the deep hypolimnion never warms up beyond about 4C in the warmest months in summer. \n\nThe biggest threat is still humans, sadly\u2026 We keep dumping crap - literal crap and figurative crap - into the lakes and expect them to just \u201chandle\u201d it because they\u2019re so large. The Laurentian Great Lakes contain 23% of the world\u2019s surface fresh water supply, and we should be doing more as the only species capable of making choices that have broad-reaching effects on the environment, to protect this precious resource.",

In fact a few days ago we were about 12 miles off the Canadian coast on the east side of the lake, and it looked like someone had given the forest along the shore a \u201cflat-top\u201d haircut. In some areas, it looked like a clear cut, and in others you could see individual tree trunks - likely the tallest trees in the area that we could actually see from shore - but even those sections had a distinct flat line above the trees.",

I.e. that Toronto should actually be below the horizon, not above it.\n\nBut what's happening is that the light is acutally being bent around the earth, kind of like when the sun sets in the sea, you actually see the sun for longer than that she's actually above the horizon.\n\nBut good luck explaining the bending of light to someone who even refuses to acknowledge that the earth is a sphere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost likely outcome of this with a genuine flat-earther, is that you'd just reinforce his belief of a flat earth.\n\n**TL;DR: What we see here is actually much more of Toronto than we're supposed to. Due to atmospheric refraction a big portion of the image of Toronto reaches our eyes from** ***below*** **the horizon.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: at 50km (31 Miles)  (distance Niagra - Toronto) the Earth's curvature is supposed to create a \"drop\" of around 200m (640 feet). That is way more than what we see in this video.[https://earthcurvature.com/](https://earthcurvature.com/)\n\nOnly a handful of buildings in Toronto are higher than 200m (640 feet) and we clearly see much more than that here.\n\nSo what we see here is the light of Toronto being bent around the earth so show it to us from below the horizon.",

And the only cost is a slightly embarrassed looking sportsman. That's a better price than people protesting in ways that impact normal people's income or that governments react to with military responses.",

If the guy simply did a handshake, we wouldn\u2019t be here. Every single Ukrainian feels a massive responsibility to do every little thing we can to not let the world forget, to somehow do our best to always keep the the most important topic above any and every activity.\nYes sometimes it comes across as dick moves, because there\u2019s anger there, but more than anger, there\u2019s chronic terror and PTSD. Because if the world stops caring we as people may not survive. So we need people to care and to keep on having these discussions.\nI\u2019m really sorry that sometimes it\u2019s unpleasant. And I\u2019m sorry for the Iranian athlete because he seems like a nice person. But please understand, this is the way to keep you talking and paying attention. We just wanna keep on existing.

And this wasn't an attack on him at a personal level.\n\nBut what's important to understand is the context. \nThis is a political statement, with the background being that each of the athletes in this international competition is a representative of their nation. That's why its the Iranian Athlete and the Ukrainian Athlete, as opposed to individual athletes regardless of nationality. \n\nThe Ukrainian is making a powerful statement against what Iran is doing, in having a direct responsibility for the destruction in Ukraine. \n\nIs it gonna change much? No likely not. Is it bad sportsmanship, in a way yes.\n\n But given the fact that its a political statement made under the context of an international representative of the country they are making the statement towards? In my mind, Fair Game. This isn't the first example of this from other contexts and it wont be the last.\n\nFor those pulling the Race card, try to understand that some things are not that simple. Not every act of disrespect is predicated on race. The world's a fuck ton more complicated than that. Dig a little.",

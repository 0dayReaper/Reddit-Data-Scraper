The lasers make sodium atoms in the atmosphere glow like artificial stars, allowing the telescope to correct for atmospheric distortion of the light from real stars, and so create sharp images. The Very Large Telescope \u2014 run by the European Southern Observatory \u2014 obtained its first images 25 years ago, in May 1998, and has since been involved in key research including studies of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.\n\nAnd more info from wiki --[VLT (Wikipedia)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope)\n&gt; The VLT is one of the most productive ground-based facilities for astronomy, second only to the Hubble Space Telescope in terms of the number of scientific papers produced from facilities operating at visible wavelengths. Some of the pioneering observations made using the VLT include the first direct image of an exoplanet, the tracking of stars orbiting around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, and observations of the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.",

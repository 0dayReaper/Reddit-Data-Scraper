Is it still the same piece with a different banana?

The golden ratio is like pi. Just as it\u2019s impossible to find a perfect circle in the real world, the golden ratio cannot strictly be applied to any real world object. It\u2019s always going to be a little off, which means no piece of art that claims to have used it is actually applying it fully to their art, it will never perfectly fit. \n\nNow, you might think that as long as the golden ratio is applied as close as possible that it would be enough for the effect to work, right? It probably would be, if there were anything to scientifically support the notion that the golden ratio had any bearing on why we find certain objects and artworks aesthetically appealing. \n\nBut there isn\u2019t. The idea that the golden ratio has any relationship to aesthetics at all comes primarily from two people, one of whom was misquoted, and the other of whom was just making shit up. \n\nThe first guy was Luca Pacioli, a Franciscan friar who wrote a book called\u00a0'De Divina Proportione' back in 1509, which was named after the golden ratio. Pacioli's book didn't argue that the golden ratio could be applied to art, architecture, and design, it simply theorized the existence of a system of rational proportions in nature. However, because Pacioli was close friends with Leonardo da Vinci, a rumor began to spread that DaVinci himself used those proportions as a secret math to create his art. \n\nOne man who believed this was Adolf Zeising, a German psychologist who argued that the golden ratio was a universal law\u00a0that described\u00a0\u201cbeauty and completeness in the realms of both nature and art.\u201d\n\nThe only problem with Zeising was he saw patterns where none exist. For example,\u00a0Zeising argued\u00a0that the golden ratio could be applied to the human body by taking the height from a person\u2019s navel to his toes, then dividing it by the person\u2019s total height. These are just arbitrary body parts, crammed into a formula. When measuring anything as complex as the human body, it\u2019s easy to come up with examples of ratios that are very near to 1.6. (the golden ratio). \n\nBut it didn't matter that Zeising made it all up, the idea became popular and now it persists to this day even though there is no real evidence to support it. \n\nIn fact, studies show people don't even prefer the golden ratio. The University of Stanford tested hundreds of students asking them to pick a favorite rectangle out of a group of rectangles, one of which used the golden ratio. If there was any truth behind the idea then the students would have all picked the one rectangle that used the ratio; instead they seemed to pick randomly, and if asked to repeat the exercise they often picked different rectangles. \n\nTLDR: The golden ratio is a myth partially created by a man who was misquoted and popularized by another man who made up a bunch of nonsense. It is not possible for any real world object to accurately fit into the golden ratio because it's an irrational number, there's no scientific evidence to support it and studies show that people don't even prefer the golden ratio when they see it in blind studies.",

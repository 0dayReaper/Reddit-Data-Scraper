At first I thought they just dumped them in there and the machine sorted them out and lined them up all on its own. \n\nObviously this is still a very efficient upgrade compared to manual brick laying. But it\u2019s still people who are building the road, the machine just helps with the process. And quite a bit at that.\n\nAlthough maybe there a little people inside our printers painting each line on the page? Who knows \u00af\\\\\\_ (\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

There is no difference. Wtf? \n\n&gt; Hills are easier to climb than mountains. They are less steep and not as high. But, like a mountain, a hill will usually have an obvious summit, which is its highest point. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, there is no official difference between hills and mountains.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with that? \n\n&gt; The U.S. Board on Geographic Names once stated that the difference between a hill and a mountain was 1,000 feet of local relief, but this was abandoned in the early 1970s. Broad agreement on such questions is essentially impossible, which is why there are no official feature classification standards.\n\nMind blown. And they aren\u2019t wrong\u2026",

Like elevation is generally measured from (average) sea level but that produces situations where Denver Colorado is in the middle of some dead ass flat plains that, at 1.6km, are higher then [most of the Appalachians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_of_the_Appalachians). \n\nYou can try for relative prominence but that's always going to be an even more subjective starting point. Especially when you consider that mountains are rarely lonely so you can get some very complicated local topography. \n\nOh and of course whatever you come up with some local \"mountains\" are probably just hills but good luck getting the locals to accept the demotion. \n\nIf you want to have more fun though try to find out what the tallest mountain on Earth is.",

Im not sure why, maybe it was the lighting, or the clouds looming over the mountains in the distance (this was during the atmospheric river thing, so I was excitedly babbling to my friend about the rain shadow effect, because it was cool to see it so clearly)... but man I don't know how to describe it... it was just so... pastoral?

All very green and extremely pretty. \n\nIf you want to piss people off you can include Santa Barbara county and Ventura county as well which have a lot of hills and light forests. Technically Southern California but most consider it the Central Coast. Probably shouldn't mention that area up through SLO because it is such a hidden gem, though a bit rural.\n\nTL;DR there's a reason we've gotten generations of transplants.",

Point that at the right part of the scene that is many miles away and you might get a photo like this on a perfectly clear day from the right vantage point.\n\nNormally in real life the hills would be several or dozens of times closer than the mountains would be to your vantage point, so the perspective would be very different.",

It\u2019s one of my all time favorites!\n\nIt\u2019s weird that I can remember almost every single scene, recall all the classic quotes and clearly hear the voices from all the characters but I can\u2019t give you even a single detail about the first movie.\n\nLol Ok maybe a few details! Only things I can kind of recall about the first movie is Bernard started as the janitor, they try to help a girl named Penny, and of course the ever so infamous pair of real breasts that show up in the background of a single frame when Bernard and Bianca are riding on Orville (the albatross).",

As soon as I yelled he bolted for the nearest barn door, he didn\u2019t look to see what I was alarming on, just knew I sounded the alarm call. I thought that was cool as well, he trusted me and just bolted in the nick of time. I love our owls though, we have barred owls around also that I can recognize the hoot.

Also, animals don\u2019t have access to medicine, bandages, or other methods of healing, and generally have worse pain tolerances than we do.* This means that both the owls and the intruder don\u2019t want to risk injury.\n\nMy assumption is that the owls had the intruder restrained, minimizing his threat and putting the owls in the dominant position. On the other end, the intruder realized he was in danger, but while restrained and submissive he was at least risk of harm. Then, the intruder sees an opportunity, another brief scrap occurs, and the intruder realizes it isn\u2019t worth the time or effort and flees.\n\n*edit to add that this is based off research that I\u2019ve read, but it could be wrong since measuring pain in other animals can be tricky",

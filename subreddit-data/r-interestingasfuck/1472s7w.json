            "comment": "These are super-interesting animals that were actually pretty different from modern elephants, and the artwork is cool but (many experts, if not most, would say) out of date and probably inaccurate.  But awesome.\n\nDeinotheria differed from elephants in a bunch of ways, such as having a longer and more flexible neck and being a lot better at running, even though some of them were much bigger than modern elephants.  Their tusks grew out of the lower jaw, not upper jaw, and probably weren't surrounded by skin.  Their lower lips were behind the tusks, not in front, and the tusks entirely came out the mouth, not beneath it, as in this artwork.\n\nThey did have shorter, heavier trunks, but apparently long enough ones to reach the ground easily; current reconstructions say they probably had to use their trunks to drink water, for instance.  Their tusks show wear from use on the sides and back, suggesting they used them for pulling, probably to pull on vegetation.  There are a bunch of ways they could have done this, probably in conjuction with the trunk (to pull things apart? to pull small trees down?), but it's hard to say exactly.",

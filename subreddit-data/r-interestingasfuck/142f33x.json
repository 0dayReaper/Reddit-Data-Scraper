When the next one came around, it was cloudy again and he couldn't see it. Did the calculations again and it turned out it would be a long time before another would occur in that location.\n\nSo he gave up, packed his things and went home to find his wife had remarried because everyone just assumed he died on the trip.\n\nOof size large.",

He was on his way to India to take measurements of the transit of Venus to compare with other astronomers' measurements from across the globe so they could calculate the distance to the Sun.\n\n&gt;The ship was blown off-course by unfavorable winds and spent five weeks at sea. By the time it finally got close to Pondicherry, the captain learned that the British had occupied the city, so the frigate was obliged to return to Isle de France. When 6 June came the sky was clear, but the ship was still at sea, and he could not take astronomical observations with the vessel rolling about. Having already completed the trip from Paris, he stayed for the next transit of Venus, which would come in another eight years (they occur in pairs 8 years apart, but each such pair is separated from the next by 121 or 105 years).\n\n&gt;After spending some time mapping the eastern coast of Madagascar, he decided to record the 1769 transit from Manila in the Philippines. Encountering hostility from the Spanish authorities there, he headed back to Pondicherry, which had been restored to France by peace treaty in 1763, where he arrived in March 1768. He built a small observatory to view the transit. On the day of the event, 4 June 1769, the sky became overcast, and Le Gentil saw nothing.\n\n&gt;The return trip was first delayed by dysentery, and further when his ship was caught in a storm and dropped him off at \u00cele Bourbon (R\u00e9union), where he had to wait until a Spanish ship took him home. He finally arrived in Paris in October 1771, having been away for eleven years, only to find that he had been declared legally dead and been replaced in the Royal Academy of Sciences. His wife had remarried, and all his relatives had \"enthusiastically plundered his estate\". Due to shipwrecks and wartime attacks on ships, none of the letters he had sent to the Academy or to his relatives had reached their destinations. Lengthy litigation and the intervention of the king were ultimately required before he recovered his seat in the academy and remarried.",

Also since he is most likely at a distance to get the perspective he is going for, there is a lot of atmosphere to distort the image, made worse by heat haze coming from the ground. \nI would imagine it would be a challenge to get a crisp picture.",

But if you *cut* the center  you can see more of it, even with the loss of quality. This is what your phone does when you ask it to 'digital zoom' - it's not a zoom in any way, it just cuts everything outside the frame.\n\nSo, what happened here: you take a picture from *really* far away. For that you need a special lens like 400mm or even 2000mm - this alone makes the image quality worse because from that distance any micro-movement will result in noise and blurring, plus it typically doesn't allow a lot of light in compared to regular lenses. And even so, it's so far far away and it's so small that on a full image (say 4000x6000) it only takes a small part of the whole pic. Now, would you care to guess how much space *the moon itself* without all the background is taking? I'm guessing around 600x750 of that picture, so this is what was cut. This is what is called a 100% cut which is done by cutting a portion of the full image to get a better look at a smaller, yet worse, part.",

If you're taking a picture of the moon that you're preparing 3 years for, then you're probably going to have at least an 800mm, and you're probably going to have a 40+ megapixel camera. That combo, when cropped so that the moon is this size in the frame, would result in at least 2400 x 1200 image (rough estimate based on how big my photos of the moon are cropped similarly from a 600mm, 24 mp combo).\n\nI can almost guarantee you, either this isn't the highest resolution that exists of this crop, or the photographer didn't really plan this photo out as meticulously as the title implies. Probably the former rather than the latter.",

For that you need a special lens like 400mm or even 2000mm - this alone makes the image quality worse because from that distance any micro-movement will result in noise and blurring, plus it typically doesn't allow a lot of light in compared to regular lenses. And even so, it's so far far away and it's so small that on a full image (say 4000x6000) it only takes a small part of the whole pic. Now, would you care to guess how much space the moon itself without all the background is taking? I'm guessing around 600x750 of that picture, so this is what was cut. This is what is called a 100% cut which is done by cutting a portion of the full image to get a better look at a smaller, yet worse, part.",

Over three years you'll have 37 days where the shot is even possible.\n\nSecond, the moon moves faster than you think. That image can only exist for a moment.\n\nThird, it's not as simple as moving around with it camera, because in order to get a shot with the statue facing the camera you have only a limited area you can be in for the shot to work, and while you can often move a bit here or a bit there, what you really need is a very good idea in advance of precisely where the moon and statue will line up, and then you have to find something on that line that has a clear view of the statue and sky, including the room to fine-tune your location, *and* you have to do that fine-tuning before the moon moves away (see second point).\n\nFinally, Rio sees rain about 30% of its days annually, and surely it sees clouds more often. That shot is impossible if it's cloudy (not to mention other air pollution or atmospheric conditions that could ruin it). \n\nAdd all these things up (and many more I haven't thought of) and it's easy to see this taking a long time to execute, even if it was perfectly planned on day one",

The moon has to be besides it (not in front nor to the sides so let's say 25% chance)\n3. It can't be a cloudy or rainy day\n4. Has to be a full moon\n5. You need to be at the exact location at the right time\n\n\nAlso you can't just look at the moon everyday to see if it's gonna be good,by that time it would be too late, you need to be ready weeks in advance",

You might end up with a cloudy sky on occasion, but this should not take more than 2-3 lunar cycles to get a clear night with a full moon\n\n3. You do not have to have *perfect planetary alignment* to get a shot like this. Move left, right, up, or down a bit and you can align the moon (or any other celestial body) with anything in the foreground.\n\nPost is not IAF",

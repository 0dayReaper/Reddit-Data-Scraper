A thorn, written sloppily, looks rather like \u201cy\u201d, leading to the classic medieval meme \u201cye olde\u201d instead of \u201cthorn+e\u201d or \u201cthe olde\u201d.",

We generate electricity by using other forms of energy.",

This information was not made public, until engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.[53]",

Importantly, since the 70's, it became car-free and the asphalt top was removed. Since 1965, all of the statues have been replaced with replicas, and the originals can be seen in the National Museum.",

They are built to last and the life of the structure can be maintained and extended with very simple and cost effective maintenance.  The weak point for bridge construction is most definitely the 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s.  It was an era of Modern design ideas and techniques ..... coupled with substandard materials, construction practices and mis-understanding of the modern design philosophies.\n\nSource: I\u2019m a geotechnical / bridge engineer who assesses and maintains around 400 rail bridges of various vintage and construction type from late 1800\u2019s until very recent structures.",

It's similar to building a pier.  You plunk down some beams, hammer them together with cross pieces, and unless you get a really destructive current, they should stay put under their own weight for at least a little while.\n\nThe reason for pile-driving the heavier posts is not so that the structure can be built -- it's so that the structure will stay built after the middle part is emptied of water.  Suddenly there isn't equal force on all sides, and the river would collapse the whole thing if it weren't reinforced.",

Those two terms meant the same person back then - someone who would design, source, contract, and manage the entire process. It was all meticulously planned out. Different stone from different regions. Stone had to be quarried and left exposed for a season before it could be cut into shape. And the bulk of the cutting would be done at the quarry, with just some finishing touches done at site. Different wood from different regions was more or less appropriate for different uses, such as scaffolding or for instruments such as the levels they used (chorobates) which were just super straight, super stable logs with little grooves in the top where water would sit and tell you if the log was level - they used that for things like surveying. They would have done soundings to guage the suitability of the river bottom, they would have dug test holes on the banks to see the subsoil conditions, they would have built scale models before building the real thing, etc.\n\nThe cranes were \"treadwheels\".. think giant hamster wheels with people inside walking. Those are what powered the hoists up and down. They would build those custom for the job based on the heaviest loads. They built custom rafts to float materials out into the river. \nAnd so on, and so on.\n\nIts quite impressive",

The problem with that is that it doesn't add to the overall economy in any meaningful way. Let's say it is a bridge. The loss of the bridge has an economic impact, but the repair of the bridge just allows the current economy to continue. Even building a new bridge to replace the old only allows the current economy to continue. Building an additional bridge may allow more economic activity to happen, but the other bridge is falling down, which would lessen the benefits of the new bridge.\n\nAdd on to this that if you replace it in the same way you built it, with a preformed reinforced concrete structure, because that is the most economical way to do it, you have the same problem in 50 years as you have now.\n\nLook at the amount of concrete in the US that has been used over the 20th century. It has been used a lot. Now consider that, at the moment, China is using the same amount of concrete the US used in the 20th century **every year**.",

More than worth it.  When you look up all the kids available for adoption who are in the foster system it's true, there's thousands. But if you only look at kids under 5, no siblings and no issues, that's not who's waiting for a family.",

Remember that if you do adoption through the foster system you won't be covering the costs of the actual adoption.  \n\nAs for costs of raising children, yes and no.  The things that are expensive about raising kids isn't really the stuff I expected.  Food and clothing is of course 3x more with 3 kids but there are a lot of easy ways to minimize these costs. Especially with clothes.  Children adopted through foster care keep their Medicare coverage until 18.  I also believe most state colleges offer free tuition.  Those two things alone are huge benefits.  The bigger costs I've experienced with kids have been that I've worked part time instead of full time to be more available to them but that's just what we needed in our situation, not a requirement in any way.  Also, hobbies and sports can get expensive but there's also ways to promote both in a frugal manner.  There were times when we qualified for food stamps but I'd say we were still able to provide a very comfortable standard of living for our children because we are frugal so that we can splurge on what's important to us.  Plus, the tax benefits of having kids can seriously add up, right now it's like 2000 extra per kid. We took in two family members children and it was a wild ride emotionally but once you have one kid, additional ones really just add to the fun.",

It also comes with things help with the adoption process and, depending on the state and/or child, you can qualify for a monthly stipend to help cover the child's costs (which comes in handy with some of the needs) and Medicaid until they turn 18 (which is helpful if one's insurance sucks).  \n\nThere are tens of thousands of kids who are waiting for a heart family and a forever home.

That was emphasised in the training along with horror stories of security guards going to prison for accidentally nudging people and making then fall on concrete or yes, putting their weight on people and suffocating them. Everyone walked away from training with very little except a clear message to be careful to not kill people and focus on deescalation. You'd think police could perhaps have a dash of this module peppered into their training. Instead they seem to be encouraged to escalate and trained to turn to brutality and lethal force quickly.",

I saw people hanging out of car windows blaring music, people egging cops on to fight them, cop cars vandalized with acab and pigs. I even saw a swat car with graffiti. All of downtown had graffiti over every building. The state Capital building was vandalized. There were about 50 cops on the steps to the capital and 100s of protestors in front of them spewing anger. I saw a dude on a motorcycle riding on the grass in front of it burning out, right in front of police. People were in plague masks and balaclavas. Rocks and bottles were being thrown at police on 4th south (a busy street in salt lake). Fireworks were exploding everywhere. The smoke from the cars set on fire was visible from a mile away. It wasn't real to me until I was there. The anger was in the air. You could literally feel it. \n\nThe part that sticks out the most to me was an old man, walking back home from getting his groceries, mouth agape as he was seeing what I just described.  This feels... different. I've never seen anything like this.",

It definitely got [more chaotic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/gu0bbz/crowd_torches_mans_car_after_he_pointed_bow_and/) after I left. Lol.       \n      \nI'm in SLC. This is not at all what I saw. I saw a dozen lunatics rampaging and acting like idiots while 100 other people stood in small groups chit-chatting with each other and being friendly with the police. Some, as in a few, very few buildings were graffitied. The cop car being flipped caught everyone off guard, and no one nearby seemed to see it happen. It was as if a group rolled in, flipped it, lit it ablaze, and bolted. Then, everyone else just stood around confused as hell. Literat everyone watching it burn was asking everyone else what idiots where bat shit dumb enough to do that. Even the SLC PD were pretty chill and just kept everyone away from it to prevent them from being hurt. They asked questions, but they didn't even accuse anyone nearby of doing it because everyone looked genuinely baffled.      \n       \nEdit: I did enjoy your writing, and I heard two cars were flipped. So, maybe it got more chaotic after I left. Idk.",

I dont know enough personally to make other statements or speculations on the subject. \n\nAnother subject worth bringing up is that I guess in Sandy there is a well known (supposedly) group that likes to kick things like this up a notch. It began as a car line around  the downtown police station, and quickly turned more riot like as agitators stirred the pot and mob mentality set in. \n\nThe two cars that I know of that got burned, one was a police car with nobody in it, and another was a vehicle that belonged to a guy who shot a protester in the leg with a bow/crossbow. The guy who shot the weapon was not arrested and was interviewed by Fox News, although I heard they made an apology after videos of Bow dude came out.",

The fact it changes the meaning of the art is irrelevant to whether or not it is vandalism. But the fact it is vandalism can impact the meaning of the art.\n\nAlso putting traffic cones on statues isn't vandalism because there's no destruction or damage (assuming none occurred during the placement). \n\nI'm sure there's another term for non-destructive vandalism like the cones, chalk, or dye that runs off in rain, etc. They can also have artistic merits too.",

At the end of the day, art can be created to try and convey the emotions and responses you want, but the public will still have the right to interpret it as it will. \n\nThe same thing happened with that statue of the bull by the stock market. The bull was supposed to show the strength of the US economy or something similar. But people got frustrated with how commercialism in America is in some ways putting the value of the dollar before the value of a life, and an artist installed a little girl standing defiant before the bull. Suddenly the bull no longer was symbolic of the strength of the economy, but of a bully market being defied by the little girl. (Loose interpretations, sorry if anything is off/inaccurate but that was how I personally interpreted the situation)",

The more steep angle it falls on the more it bends. But at some point when it bends more than 180\u00b0 light can't get to the air instead it comes back in the water. Thats why its looking shiny.",

                            "comment": "I think it's also, and more subtly, because of how the edge of the \"pool\" looks. Water has both adhesive and cohesive properties -- the adhesion is why water tends to cling up the sides of a container, while cohesion causes the surface tension that holds water droplets together. Because the video is upside down, the clinging \"up\" makes it look like the air is bulging out of the pool, which incidentally is exactly what liquid mercury would look like. That's because mercury is cohesive but not very adhesive, so it tends to ball up and recede from the sides of a container. Combined with the shiny appearance from total internal reflection, it really does look like a pool of mercury!",

Even if you found intelligent alien life, you\u2019d find a trait similar to this. \n\nHere\u2019s my logic- all intelligent life needs a basis of comparison to make decisions. How can you decide what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad? You compare directly. \n\nThis comparison happens both across subjects (2 objects at the same time) and across time (2 objects compared at different times, old and new). \n\nThis creates the ability to measure value and to quantify improvement over time. \n\nThis causes us to have an immutable connection to our past. We like to see where we came from to tell where we are going. So collecting rare objects from the past is kind of like a novel and fun side effect of those instincts.",

Insurance had an appraiser out 3 days after the fire. I got the check made out to me and BoA in the mail 2 days later. I sent it *overnight* postage that day to BoA. I had to threaten to sue before I finally got it.\n\n\"OH, it just got transferred to X department!, you should have it in 3-5 days!\" I heard that so many times... I'd make them look up how long I had waited after the first couple months and they would act all outraged and apologetic.\n\n \"I'm terribly sorry sir. I see where the mistake was made. Don't you worry, I will get this straightened out right this second.\" I heard some variation of that every call during the second half of the wait. I'm pretty sure the call center people were told to make up whatever they could to just get rid of the call. \n\nI had to use the money from my contents check to pay the contractors so I could actually live in my house for all those months.\n\nMy GC said he wouldn't have taken the job if he had known BoA was the mortgage company. That was the 4th time a customer with BoA was scrambling to get him paid on what should have been routine low-risk bid. \"Small fire, nothing structural, fully insured?\" Should have been an easy, guaranteed paid job. \n\nThey just **DON'T GIVE A FUCK** about doing anything that isn't some slimy attempt to get more money out of you.\n\nAll this was right after the mortgage crisis, you would have *thought* they would have trimmed out some of the bullshit they liked to pull after a scare like that... Nope.\n\n(sorry about the rant. Even after all these years, the bullshit I had to go through because of those fuckwads still infuriates me)",

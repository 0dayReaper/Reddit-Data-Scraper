If the animals sees its refletion and realises that the image is one of itself, it will try to touch/get rid of the spot on his own face, passing the test. If they instead interact with the mirror or loose interest without investigating the paint, they fail the mirror test.",

You don't see animals directly underneath you usually, so when you see it in the water, you know it isn't real. Meanwhile, the mirror has the reflection face-to-face standing up, like you'd see other animals. So it's harder to differentiate the \"illusion\" from the real thing.\n\nMaybe most animals intuitively understand reflections, but only in specific circumstances like in bodies of water (you don't see lions or any other animal taken aback when they see their reflection in the water).",

Same goes for Wikipedia articles. Sure, some are garbage, but some are also well maintained and reflect current scientific understanding.  \n\nSo yeah, I totally get an innate distrust of YouTube and Wikipedia. Did you personally review those sources, from such scientifically ignorant places as the Smithsonian Institute?",

This graphic is slightly more forgivable, as its entire goal is just to highlight key milestones in our own evolution, but again, unless you understand what you're looking at, it is easy to entirely misunderstand something like this. The worst offense these sorts of things can do is enforce the notion that evolution always had a goal in mind, or that humans are somehow the peak of evolution. Humans are no more evolved than a snail, a tiger, or a banana, and our existence as we are today is purely the result of survivability enabled through the selection of random mutations. It's not random, but it's driven by random factors fed into a non-random filter.      \nPoint is, this kind of reduction of evolution into a straight line, while occasionally useful for beginners, often does more harm than good, if people don't go on to study the topic further.",

Evolution is not a stationary thing though, and as our environment changes, particularly with the looming threat of climate change, there is every possibility that we will no longer be suitable for our new environment, and that other creatures will supplant us as the most generally successful creature on our planet.",

The climate runs in cycles, yes, this is known, and we have pretty conclusive records of historical temperatures from things like ice cores and sedimentary layers. We are in a warming trend right now, at least on certain scales- there are many nested cycles that run on the orders of decades, centuries, millennia, and so forth- this is also true, but we have rapidly outpaced typical amounts of warming, and massively so, because of human-driven hydrocarbon emissions causing run away greenhouse effects. This is not controversial, it is the consensus of the entire scientific community save for a few fringe conspiracy theorists who don't understand the science they are trying to publish (and failing to do so in any reputable journal).     \nWhat would the motivation for everybody lying even be? Occam's Razor, or the principle of parsimony if you prefer, states that the conclusion that requires the fewest assumptions is typically the correct one. In this case, there is a pretty clear motivation for certain corporations, and the governments and \"scientists\" that support them, to lie about the reality of climate change- that motivation being profit. On the other hand, for it to make any sense for the entire scientific community to lie about something like this, you would need to weave a grand, all-encompassing conspiracy theory where people are going to ridiculous lengths to ensure that observable reality confirms that human activity is having a negative impact on our environment... for reasons? And on top of this, you would have to ensure that none of the billions of people who were in on the plan ever breathed a word of it to anybody else, making it even more untenable.      \nIf you have any credible sources I'm willing to see them, though I suspect that if there was some bombshell evidence that everybody else was entirely wrong about the very obvious fact of human-driven climate change, we all would have heard of it by now.",

Also crocodiles and horseshoe crabs.\n\nIdk how far up humans are on that list, but usually \"most evolved\" just means how \"dominant\" they are over other organisms. If planet earth is summed up to be one big ecosystem, how well and how many places can a given organism survive? And no bacteria don't count because bacteria is not a specific species unless you can think of a bacteria species as dominant and versatile as humans.",

Here is [an episode of the Common Descent podcast](https://commondescentpodcast.com/2020/06/27/episode-90-living-fossils/) where two professional paleontologists and science communicators discuss the notion of 'living fossils.' (You'll want to skip to 37:35 to jump over the news section)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's kind of a debated term because it might skew the (public) perception of certain groups. Crocodilians for example have a truly rich and diverse fossil record that people often gloss over when portraying them. Also, organisms are more than just their outward appearance. What doesn't get preserved by the fossil record might actually conceal some interesting things, right? The fact that some lineages have remained recognisable may also mean that they have found a stable niche and are experiencing active evolutionary pressure to stay in similar, right?  \nIt's an interesting topic, and I highly encourage you to look into it...(the podcast I linked in general is a great source of professional paleontological science communication and I can't recommend it enough as just a fascinating listening experience)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n~~Coelacanths are not extinct~~",

Evolution works specifically within the environments that a creature lives in. You can have a penguin with all the best penguin genes, and they're gonna kick ass in the Antarctic, but put them in a jungle and they'll probably be tiger food within minutes. Something like a coelacanth or a crocodile has changed so little over time because they've arrived at a body plan that is nearly perfect for their environment, and no new mutations have become cemented in their genome because there isn't any significant differential survival pressure. This isn't to say that they've stopped evolving though. Sure, their traits might remain nearly the same, but with every generation they're still undergoing the process of random mutation, most of which are neutral, some of which are detrimental and get weeded out, and a rare few of which might provide slight improvements, which over an even greater stretch of time could potentially come to dominate certain populations.      \nMost evolved and dominant are two separate things, and the first one is not really a real thing. As ever, though, it all comes down to how you define your terms. The way I see it, while humans might be generally dominant over a larger part of the earth than most (though not all, by a long shot) other creatures, it's not because we're more evolved, it's just because we're evolved in a different way, one which has given us greater reproductive success and control of our environments.",

Maybe explain how baby is made?\n\nBtw humans can survive indefinitely in the antarctic.\n\n&gt; Sure, their traits might remain nearly the same, but with every generation they're still undergoing the process of random mutation\n\nA random mutation in a genome does not constitute \"evolution\" or \"being more evolved\". Randomized DNA is a feature *of* evolution, it is not evolution itself. If the changed DNA does not contribute positively to the organism's survival, then it is not \"evolving\". Otherwise you'd called every single change in DNA \"evolution\" and so someone hit with a gamma ray blast would be \"highly evolved\" lol. But being more charitable to you, even random changes over generations that don't enhance and maybe hurt the organism isn't \"evolution\".\n\n&gt; The way I see it, while humans might be generally dominant over a larger part of the earth than most (though not all, by a long shot) other creatures, it's not because we're more evolved, just because we're evolved in a different way,\n\nBut that would literally make them more evolved according to the second (and most colloquially common) definition. The end goal of evolution is to optimize an organism's survival through replication in an environment. So an organism that maximizes that goal criteria could easily be called \"more evolved\" and that be a useful, utility having, definition of \"more evolved\". If a process is not moving towards that goal, that process is not imparting evolution.",

I can accept that we might have different perspectives on what a term like \"more evolved\" would mean, and we just happen to disagree on the use of the term, and several others. There are, however, a few ways which you are flat out wrong, but I'll get to those too. I'll choose to ignore all of the aggression and weird attempts at personal insults, saying only that I can't presume to know how much you know about any given topic, and so me providing a basic foundation is not an attempt at condescension or insult, it's just good etiquette, ensuring that the playing field is level. You'll forgive me if I don't provide helpful quotes like you did, but formatting those on mobile is a pain in the ass.       \nI'll start with a quick one- either you deliberately misunderstood my point about a human surviving in the Antarctic to be petty, or maybe I wasn't clear enough. Either way, a human definitely can survive indefinitely there- if they have a shelter, heating, and all kinds of thermal gear. Just as a penguin could survive indefinitely in a jungle if they had everything to simulate their home environment and protection form external threats. It's a point about biology, not about technology. I can see where you could argue that a human's ability to build that technology derives from our biology, and that's fair, but it still misses the point.     \nNext, randomized genetics is not a feature of evolution, it's the mechanism by which it works. Without mutation, natural selection wouldn't be possible, and evolution would be unable to happen. It's wrong to entirely conflate random mutation with evolution, just as it would be wrong to conflate a car with its engine, but they are still inextricably linked. Your assertion that only mutations that aid survival counts as evolution is, well, wrong. Evolution is a change in the heritable characteristics of a population over time. There is no stipulation that neutral or deleterious mutations don't qualify, the latter are, in fact, just as important as positive ones in selecting for the most effective traits, as very few mutations are inherently good or bad, it's only when they're tested against an environment that their usefulness can be determined. To your point about a gamma ray burst, no, that would not be evolving by my paradigm, or by that of anybody who understands the process, because individuals don't evolve, populations do. If that gamma ray exposure altered some genes which you then went on to pass to your offspring, and them to theirs, and ot happened to be that those particular changes affected your descendants' survival in the long term, for good or for ill, then *that* would be evolution.      \nYour next mistake is in concluding that evolution has an end goal. It's a perpetually ongoing process, it has no goals or directives. Think of it not as a guidebook and more of a filter. The things that happen to work for a time and place make it through, the things that don't are discarded. That's all evolution is- a non-random arrangement arising from a random process.       \nSomething can be \"more beneficially evolved for a particular niche\", hence my example of a penguin in the jungle, but to call something flatly \"more evolved\" is nonsensical. If you're using the latter to mean the former... fine, but that's only going to lead to misunderstandings. I have no issue talking to people who think I'm wrong, I actually greatly enjoy doing that, but if you're going to come at me with such snarky confidence, it's in your best interests to check your facts first.",

It's only the subjective reality of any observer, whether they are intelligent by someone's perspective or not, that creates any meaning. Intelligence is not some inherent state of being, it's just a label we use to describe our particular ability to interpret the world. For all we know, whales have a deep appreciation and understanding of some aspect of reality that we aren't keyed into. Humans are just really good at thinking like humans- that's all we have going on for us- we're also really bad at thinking like tigers, octopodes, or eagles. Our definition of intelligence in this sense is just how good is something at thinking like a human, and assumes that we somehow have the best way to think about things. None of us is better than any of the others, we just have different perspectives. It's our bias as humans that suggests that human exceptionalism is a reasonable standpoint, but that's just a bias, not immutable reality.      \nIf your stance is that humans are the best because we're the only ones who can appreciate the world around us, then you're looking at things through a very myopic lens, because we are by far not the only species to make that claim. Most other apes seem to have just as complex of an experience of life as we do, and many engage in abstract thinking and curiosity, corvids are extremely good problems solvers and have exceptional memories, and even practice several rituals like funerals and public shamings, whales have extremely complex communication syntaxes, more complex than most human languages, and they are things that need to be taught, not just known instinctually, cats have around the same level of emotional complexity as humans, dogs have intricate social structures and deep interpersonal relationships, and so on and so forth. Each of them has their own perspective on reality, each just as valid as the last, just not relevant to someone who can't share that perspective.     \nThis is also assuming that humans are the only \"intelligent\" species in the universe, which seems vanishingly unlikely considering how basic and mundane the conditions for abiogenesis are. There could be another species out there that considers itself intelligent, but to us they would look like nothing more than insects only able to react to external stimuli, or, to flip things, there could be a species with such a deep and all-encompassing understanding of reality that we wouldn't even be able to relate to them,  and they would see us as simple insects.      \nThere is also the factor that there are other models for \"intelligent\" behaviour that don't look anything like ours. Consider an ant- alone it's pretty useless, but when synced up with a whole colony, they can build complicated structures, farm aphids and fungi, and do all kinds of things beyond any individual.      \nThe point of all of this is that everything is subjective, and we often forget that humans are a part of nature, not apart from it. Were no better or worse than anything else, we're just better at being humans.",

That doesn't mean that any being's *subjective* purpose is invalid. In fact, it means just the opposite- that all perspectives are equally valid, no matter the complexity or lack thereof. You might decide that what makes your experience valid is the fact that you can interpret the world around you in complex ways; a dog might decide that what makes her experience valid is the fact that she can be there for her master unconditionally, a lion might decide that what makes his experience valid is that he can be the master of his own pride, ruling over a large domain. Each of those internal motivations is equally important, but only relevant to the one holding it.      \nYou then go on to mention that only an anthropocentric point of view makes sense for reaching an understanding. That touches on my point exactly- that is the only point of view that makes sense... to a human. We're not special in any way, we're just another type of ape making sense of the world in a way that works with our brain chemistry.     \nWe are by a long shot not the only species that creates and destroys things, physically or otherwise. Look at termite mounds, Beaver dams, and Bower bird nests, or in terms of abstract things, look at how a dog genuinely loves their owner, how Bonobos have complex social and economic systems centered around food and sex, or how, as previously mentioned, crows mourn their dead or whales teach their children. We are a different expression of life, but there is nothing that fundamentally elevates us above anything else. Put us underwater for long enough and we die, so from a fish's perspective we're poorly evolved. Put us in the Antarctic for long enough and we die, so from a penguin's perspective we're poorly evolved. We evolved to fit a particular ecological niche, one where enhanced problem solving skills and social aptitude were key factors in our propagation, so those are the qualities that we've run with, instead of, say, the ability to dig deep underground or the ability to withstand ionizing radiation. Our intelligence is not some mark of exceptionalism, it's just a useful adaptation that has made us a successful species for the time being.     \nHuman beings are not what makes the earth important, they're what makes human society important. Just as ants are not what make the earth important, but they're definitely what makes an anthill important. Your assertion that humans are the only thing of value on this planet can only be coming from a sense of homocentric narcissism, and a failure to see the bigger picture. Imagine if all life on earth *except* for humans was suddenly Thanos snapped out of existence. Would you say that nothing of importance was lost? Even if we somehow found a way to continue surviving (spoiler alert: it would be an ever collapsing pyramid scheme of cannibalism- that would be the only option.), would you still maintain that we haven't lost any valuable \"information\"? If so, then I don't think there is any reconciling our world views, as I simply cannot see things so myopically as that.     \nIt's also relevant to point out that life isn't just information, it's complex chemical reactions, social structures, abstract ideas, and biological imperatives, relevant unto itself whether there is anything else to interpret it in a way that makes sense to humans or not.\nYou seem very concerned with the idea that things are useless unless somebody notices them. It makes me think of the classic \"If a tree falls in the forest with nobody around, does it still make a sound?\" The obvious, empirical answer to that is yes, but if you extend that same concept to the universe, I'd say the same ideas are relevant. If something happens on a distant planet with nobody around to notice it, does it still matter? As everything else, it depends on your perspective. You might not care, and that might be reasonable if it's never going to affect your life, but that doesn't mean it's never going to affect anybody's life, and even if it never does, not in the entirety of time and space, it is still a real thing that happened, and so you can't just write it off as universally irrelevant. If your perspective is simply that you care about reality and the things that happen within it, then this event on another planet would be relevant to you, even if you never actually learned about it; the very possibility of that sort of thing happening would matter to you. Basically what I'm saying is that \"useless\" and \"useless *to you*\" are different things, and neither you nor any one of us is important enough to be the sole or collective arbiter of meaning.      \nThis might be pedantic, but your claim that we have to assume that there are no aliens until we find evidence of them is a logical fallacy. Until we find evidence of them, we have to conclude that we don't know enough to come down on one side or the other. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It is reasonable to live our lives without taking the potential existence of aliens into account, but that is not the same thing as an obligation to assume we're alone. The sheer vastness of the universe, simplicity of abiogenesis, abundance of basic elements, and so forth, make the likelihood of life existing elsewhere incredibly likely, nearly to the point of certainty, but still, without evidence, the only intellectually honest position is \"I don't know\".      \nYour position of requiring dominance is an alarming one. Why do we need to dominate when we can coexist? If you can point to one thing that our intelligence provides that can actually be considered superior, it's that it provides us with the ability to supercede such brutal approaches to survival- to see the value in things beyond ourselves and to work to bring things into harmony. That ability is often misused, or not used at all, certainly, but we can do it where others can't. And even then, many others still can. Ravens have been observed playing with and training wolf pups, forming relationships and partnerships that benefit both parties. Plenty of animals have been known to take in orphans of other species, with no tangible benefits to themselves, to raise them and care for them when they had nobody else. Lots of rodents exercise extreme cooperative behaviour, and will often employ strategies that benefit lots of animals moderately instead of ones that benefit themselves greatly.       \nYou're also assuming that humans would even be relevant enough to any other species to be considered allies or enemies. It could be that we are so fundamentally different in the ways that we think, communicate, and live, that there isn't even the room for such relationships. We could be no more relevant to them than the dandelions on your front lawn are to you.     \n(I see to be unable to post my full reply, maybe because it's too long.

Even keeping in mind that this is a narrow perception of intelligence, as defined by the only creature we've yet confirmed to experience life precisely the way we do, intelligence is not just a basic stat score like it is in D&amp;D- it's a loose representation of situational aptitude. You could have the most educated person in the world, but they still might not be able to change the transmission on an El Camino, or sing a rap song. You could also have somebody who excels in abstract mathematics, but can't grasp the fundamental principles of epistemology, and so fails miserably in every argument they're a part of, even if they have a deep understanding of all of the relevant data. You could call human intelligent when they build a ramshackle hut, but not call a termite colony intelligent when it builds a sophisticated mound with precision engineered cooling systems and expert civic planning. My point is that even if we encounter another species that considers itself intelligent by its own metrics (and we probably already have encountered many such species on our own planet), there is nothing saying that we would even be able to recognize their intelligence or interact with it in any meaningful way. We're smart, as earth creatures go, but we're not omnipotent- we have plenty of limits on the abilities of our minds to understand things, something which becomes immediately evident when you try to, say, imagine a room with 10000 ducks in it, or conceive of the distance between ourselves and even our own sun, or imagine colours beyond the few that we can see.       \nOverall your perspective seems to be driven by a sort of militant Homocentrism, which is preventing you from accepting the fact that we are just another presentation of life on earth, one that happens to be enjoying its time in the limelight at the moment, but not one that is in any way seperate from the laws of nature. Our self-assigned intelligence lets us consider our place in the universe, and in many ways it is responsible for our place therein, but it arose from our evolution, not from outside of it- we are still apes with most of the same limitations as most other forms of life, more than some and fewer than others, and are just representatives of one vague region on the branching continuum of life. Once again, we are a part of nature, not apart from it. We are special because we claim we are, and for no other reason. I don't expect for any of us to be able to relate to the life experience of, say, a moth or a panda, that would not be reasonable, but to not recognize the arrogance in dismissing something that you have no perspective on simply because you have no perspective on it, then you're not only arrogant, you're a fool.      \nThere is a lot more that I could say, but I'd rather avoid  creating too egregious of a gish gallop by bringing up too many things that aren't direct responses to your claims.",

Or was it when multicellular life started, that it happened separately several times?\n\nUs humans, we have such a hard time not to be categorical thinkers. It has served us well to say that \"this is one thing, and this is another thing, and here is the line between them\", but that's just not how things work outside our heads. Another thing we're notoriously bad at is of course grasping big numbers, like the *billions* of years evolution has had to make tiny incremental changes.",

It's just that they are subjected to different evolutionary pressures from their environment. Some environments remain stable so the optimal might be the same, and so there are no significant changes. Other environments change, and then it just happens that certain mutations allow better survival and procreation in that new environment than for the \"originals\". Chimpanzees have evolved for just as long as we have. We didn't evolve from them but we both have a shared origin, if you look back far enough. It wasn't a human and it wasn't a chimpanzee.\n\nAnd so, *all* of humanity will continue to evolve. But if one subset of humanity finds themselves in a different enough environment to the others, those subsets will diverge. Because they are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Say for example that humans begin to go into space and start living on space stations with minimal gravity; over *long* periods of time they will diverge from those still on earth. Muscle mass could probably be reduced significantly and so on, leaving more energy for other things. Or to just reduced the need for energy overall, so that the same amount of food can feed more people; a smaller amount of food is required to produce each offspring. And most likely other changes in a myriad ways. Then if the space humans tried to go back down to earth, their newly evolved energy efficiency would instead be detrimental and the'd have trouble standing up. They wouldn't evolve \"past\" humans still on earth. It only means that they'd be better suited for their new environment.  (And the still-on-earth humans would have continued to evolve all the while, adapting as best evolution could to things like climate change and everything.)",

Humans haven't changed at all basically, for a few hundred thousand years.

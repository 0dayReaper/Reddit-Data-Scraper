And they can get heavy too. I remember learning that some marine biologists believe this is one reason whales breach- to try to slam the barnacles off when they get too heavy. But chunks of skin come off too which is why the sea lice are so important.  \n\n&gt;As they mature into adults, they form tube-shaped cavities in their shells that actually draw in prongs of growing whale skin. The result is an attachment as firmly rooted as the most pernicious weed.\n\nhttps://scienceline.org/2010/03/how-do-barnacles-attach-to-whales/",

I know very well that this is a privilege reserved for men, but I do not approve of these murderous pastimes.

You have already depopulated all of Baffin\u2019s Bay, and you will exterminate, eventually, a whole class of useful animals.\u201d\n\nlooks like you're not wrong. however he says this after slaughtering a bunch of whales that were attacking the Right Whales.

I would have been alot more cautious if it was a full grown moose. \n\nSince we're talking animal encounters I've always wanted to share one of my black bear encounters that happened about 3 years ago - Was walking down a atv trail with my senior Labrador and the bear popped out of the brush onto the trail about 60-70ft ahead of us. It didn't see us at first so I ducked down and held the old dog to make sure she wouldn't be curious and run over to it. The bear looked towards us and I picked up the dog and yelled at the bear. It ran away into the woods, but man.. listening to a bear high tail it through the woods is something else, all the trees and branches breaking. Also in hindsight I don't even think the old pup knew what happened.  Her eyesight was starting to go at that point.",

It took me a second to even realise it was a bear, i thought it was a big dog at first. Once I realised that it was a bear I was so terrified it might be a cub and the mother was potentially lurking in the bushes.\n\nI just started slowly walking backwards. It didn't notice us, just walked across the road and into the paddock on the other side. Once back on grass it started literally frolicking. It was one of the funniest, silliest things I've ever seen. Legs flailing, jumping around, at one point it took a little tumble. I was equal parts terrified and amused",

The thing is that we swim pretty uncoordinated for an animal in the sea, so a shark that would have otherwise not tried to eat something as large as a human will come up and bite you thinking it\u2019s going to get an easy meal. Then the person will trash around and hit it and the shark will think \u201cmaybe it\u2019s not such an easy meal after all\u201d and it will swim off.\n\nHowever, there are some sharks that will and have eaten people. There are many documented cases of sharks consuming people wholly and partially. In general these sharks are few in numbers and spend most of their time in places where people aren\u2019t. There\u2019s only 3500 white pointers in the entire ocean for example, the large ones would be even fewer. So if a 2m shark bites you it\u2019s probably going to swim off when you start wailing it. If a 4-5m white pointer decides it wants to eat you nothing you can do is going to stop it. They eat pretty much anything that is available, they\u2019ve even been documented eating kangaroos that have been swimming. People used to chum for them with mammal offal until it was banned. A white shark doesn\u2019t see you any different than any other animal it encounters in the ocean. We\u2019re not special in their eyes. Thankfully you\u2019re fairly unlikely to encounter one that is capable and willing to eat you.",

That\u2019s not exactly extreme hypothermia risk territory, but cold water shock is real. Most people who die in cold water incidents drown before they get hypothermia. \n\nHe\u2019s not wearing any sort of flotation device, and I presume she isn\u2019t either. I also do not see a leash. If the whale were to accidentally flick their paddle board the wrong way, they could be separated from it by 30m pretty quickly. \n\nThe most dangerous scenario would be if the whale\u2019s tail partially submerged the board. The board\u2019s buoyancy would cause it to go shooting out of the water. \n\nI know this sounds like Chicken Little nonsense to a lot of people, but I grew up around the ocean, and have lost more than one friend to the water.

When I teach friends how to surf the first thing I do is tell them to know their limits, and HOW to fall off the board and correctly bail. I\u2019ve seen tourists rent those heavy BIC boards and nearly knock themselves out and take out unsuspecting swimmers.",

There was a moment its tail was emerging right under the boat, but it tactfully maneuvers its tail to one side to avoid hitting the boat. Kinda like trying not to disturb the dog when you roll over in bed.",

The sad history is they were named because they were the 'right whale to hunt' back in the day of commercial whaling. Theres only a few small populations of the Southern and Northern left although I can't remember which one is rarer of the two. Incredible memory nonetheless.",

Hot nights, I slept on that flat roof rather than suffer the heated indoors. Many mornings at dawn, I was awakened by a roadrunner zipping across the roof... and over me in my sleeping bag. No nests on my shack, and no \"meep-meeps\" were heard -- roadrunners are a genus of cuckoos which don't vocalize that way. And no ACME products appeared. Ratz. 8-)",

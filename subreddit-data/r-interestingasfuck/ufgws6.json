Do remember that good viewing doesn't start until full darkness, so depending on your kids' ages, they might want a nap, or at least a restful lie-down, during the afternoon.\n\nAlso, tell your kids that, if they want the scope owners to love them, they should put their hands behind their backs as they snuggle up to the eyepiece, so the owner knows they're not throwing off their \"aim.\" Even the slightest jiggle at those distances can throw off their direction.\n\nIf your kids want to be outright adored, they should ask questions. Get into a good conversation with one of the owners (provided there aren't huge lines of people waiting to peep and talk), and you're golden. If they can't answer a question, they'll send you off to others in the group who can help you. They're teachers at heart.",

There's a significant overlap between the volunteer naturalist and amateur astronomer crowds. Buncha nutsos who never outgrew the \"Wow! Lookatthat!\" phase.\n\nYou sound very interested in providing opportunities for your kids to develop interest in the world and in science, so here's something that'll *really* get you going. I have a good friend who has been an amateur astronomer for several decades. He's the kind of lunatic who goes out into the flatlands of Ohio in sub-zero February temps to skywatch. He pointed out once that astronomy may be the final remaining branch of the sciences in which amateurs continue to make significant contributions. When you hear about the discovery of a new comet, it's an odds-on bet that it was initially spotted by an amateur. Of course, the PhD crowd has to verify it, but how cool would it be to have naming rights to a comet?",

It's not going to look like what you may be imagining; it's mostly what I'd describe as a \"fuzzy shape\". \n\nThe brighter galaxies like Andromeda and M81 have some shape to them. You can tell Andromeda is more of a spiral galaxy while the a cigar galaxy is shaped like, surprise, a cigar. The fuzziness is from the countless number of stars within the galaxy. \n\nThe optics of it are not exceptional however you *can* see galaxies (and other deep space objects like star clusters which look amazing in some cases) and you *can* make out shape on some of them. It's an incredibly humbling experience that you can have in your backyard depending where you livez",

Saturn will be a dot with a disc-shaped component around the middle of it. Mars - dot. Venus - dot. ALL stars (other than the sun) - dots. Celestial formations - mostly dots, some with color, some more like smudges  By dot, mostly think pinpoint of light without discernible features but maybe a certain color. \n\nSome dots bigger than others. Most notable, Saturn and Jupiter. It may be possible to discern Jupiter color bands as you get to larger telescopes. \n\nCelestial photography (not the eye) allows extremely high quality pictures taken over several minutes, hours even across several days to be compounded, enhanced, corrected and engaged. \n\nThis is an example of celestial photography. If you were viewing it with your eye through a 6\u201d scope it would be a slightly off white dot with possibly a discernible hump where the band is.",

Last summer I finally bit the bullet and bought quite an expensive telescope. After playing around with it I finally found Saturn and I kid you not I got goosebumps and was nearly brought to tears. Seeing things for yourself changes your perspective. In that moment, Saturn wasn\u2019t just a planet I see on the internet all the time, it was actually real and I was looking at it in real life. It was a wonderful feeling.",

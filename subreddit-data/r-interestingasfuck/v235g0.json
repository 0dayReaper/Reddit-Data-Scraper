Circular slide rules fit in a shirt pocket rather than a belt holster. They were less expensive too. But the scales near the center were hard to read. I recently bought an aluminum slide rule at Goodwill. It tends to bind, and must be lubricated. Many cheap slide rules were bamboo covered with plastic. I have a rosewood slide rule that belonged to my dad, who was a physicist.",

I'm not military, somebody please clarify if you can.) Routinely had Rolexes for super cheap; they were considered nice watches back then but not the same way they are today. The story goes that a lot of soldiers at the time bought them because they needed a watch.\n\nIf he bought it to hang on to it this whole time just to flip it, dude can tell the future.",

These are tax free stores for military members overseas.  Back in Vietnam guys used to use up their pay they still had in their accounts at these Exchanges before they came home.  That's what this guy did.  Luckily he chose a very unique Rolex to buy which was in the military exchange and then he never wore it and kept all the documents and box.  The show has had other Vietnam vets with less unique Rolexes worth tens of thousands that they bought at Exchanges as well but this was the biggest one I'd seen on the show years ago.",

After like, 2 beers, the dude would talk about all his old pals. Dead or alive. He seemed to be at peace with them being gone or his alive friends being a shell of who they used to be. He was really in-touch with reality &amp; knew he was lucky to keep his sanity.\n\nMy grandpa still wears his veteran hat, as much as he wears his sports teams hats. Whenever people thank him for his service he lightens up and wants to talk. Not saying they are all like this, but this guy, like my grandpa, seem cool af. I'd love to be his friend.",

            "comment": "As a disabled veteran who's been fighting the VA for full disability the last decade plus, I felt that when he fell over. I don't know his history. But, if it is at all normal or average for that time period, he's struggled in life after coming home. You just can't put a person through that and expect them all to come out as fully functional members of society. Homelessness and suicide are MAJOR problems in the veteran population that I hope we can get a hold on. 1 veteran every 68 mins kills themselves. For every 1 soldier who dies in combat, 22 will die by their own hands.\n\nI understand why. Most of them feel they've been betrayed by their nation. First, there's this idea of not complaining in the military. Honestly, I don't think this comes from a point of machismo or toxic masculinity as I've heard people say. It is because there's a mission that needs to be completed, and they put their personal well being behind that. So, not complaining, even when they should, becomes a habit they need to break when they get out. Here's the part that fucks a lot of veterans up. We suffer and suffer until we finally can't take it anymore and ask for help. But, it falls on deaf ears. So, they complain to congress because no way is this right. After all, we have a contractual obligation with the nation to provide things like healthcare when we're done serving. Again, it falls on deaf ears. They keep trying to get the help, and something like an entire year goes by. Maybe they've had an intake appointment by now, but no real care. Slowly, they realize no one actually gives a fuck, because if they did, we wouldn't be subject to what the VA does. Then, they eat a bullet because they feel like no one cares. \n\nPersonally, I am a veteran army combat medic paratrooper, served 6.5 years before I got hurt so bad in a parachute accident I had to leave. Granted, it was still an Honorable Discharge as I'd completed my original 4 year contract by then. Anyways, I've had multiple concussions, my neck always hurts, I broke my collarbone, I have bilateral labral tears in my hips from the impact of landing 50-60x, I have 2 herniated disks in my lower back, I broke my ankle, and this doesn't include any of the mental health aspects that go with the job I did. Oh, also, one time I landed on glass and almost cut my thumb off and had 40 some sutures done to put it back together. Now, I have lasting nerve damage and tiny shards of glass in my left palm/thumb. The doctor said doing surgery to find and remove the glass would cause more damage than it would most likely fix, and wouldn't recommend.\n\nFor all of that, the VA pays me $1650 a month and I live somewhat near Seattle. $550 goes to child support each month, and I try to live on the rest. It isn't cheap to live here, but I'm too poor to move now. Work has been a shit show. I've got ptsd, and makes sleep very difficult to keep on a schedule now. My left hand barely works, my back hurts all the time, I've got a limp and can't lift shit because my hips are blown out before the age of 40, etc. Whenever I write that I have a disability on a job application, no one responds. When I don't disclose that information, I end up getting fired because that stuff gets in the way of me being a decent worker. I wouldn't hire me. Yet, the VA seems to think I can, and need to find a job to make up the huge budget shortfall I have every month.\n\nI'm just ranting now. We treat our veterans like shit though. I'm happy this guy has some financial stability now, because a lot of us never do and end up on the side of the road being spit on. Cuz, you know, we are so lazy and must deserve it. \ud83d\ude11",

The way we treat our vets is abominable, my grandfather was exposed to Agent Orange, which I\u2019m pretty sure led to birth defects in both my mother and brother and most likely led to several forms of cancer. The VA constantly dodged him and tried to avoid giving him benefits. \n\nBased on all this, I have some pretty firm beliefs on how the government allocates funding, but I have nothing but respect for the veterans that served our country. While it doesn\u2019t fix anything for you, I just want to take a moment and thank you for your service",

I feel like nasa probably has some strange data but it\u2019s not as common as we might think so they don\u2019t really need to talk about what to do if it happens. I think the guys who do moon walks and the Apollo missions would probably have seen more stuff then anyone on the space station but is is probably very rare since space is really that big. We probably have strange data in all forms of science that no one can explain. I DO think there are UFOs, but the astronauts are there to work on missions and do science, so I doubt they have a lot of free time to look for UFOs. \n\nI usually ask all of my pilot friends and family members\u2026one out of 10 said he might have seen a UFO but nothing spectacular to look at. These guys spend years in the sky and it\u2019s very rare. \n\nAs usual, stigma and lack of data slows study but we still have a few crazy cases with a lot of eye witnesses and some data. \n\n1.

Either they don't care and never realized there was a lie that was told to conceal the truth or they do care and they know it was a lie to begin with and in which case wouldn't be too shocked to be told that it was all made up to hide the truth that they're out there. The way I see it is that the aliens should make their presence known in the most non threatening way possible such as making videos for YouTube that depict lighthearted interactions with aliens such as that one where the guy points a laser pointer at one very sloppily and then the craft he pointed it at first points a laser back at him very sloppily as a joke as if to say yes I saw your laser pointer so here's my laser pointer back at you. Almost like they were poking each other in good fun.",

            "comment": "In this photograph, the well-worn keys of a Steinway Model D piano evoke the presence of enormous monoliths or the entrance of a majestic temple. This intriguing perspective was captured using a Lumix S1R and a Laowa Probe lens, pushing the boundaries of traditional photography.\n\nThree key elements were manipulated to create this sense of scale: a deep focus, strong leading lines, and overhead lighting.\n\n75 images at various focal lengths were stacked together in Helicon Focus, crafting a depth of field that brings every detail into sharp relief. The creation of powerful leading lines was made possible by the unconventional choice of a wide-angle macro lens, the Laowa 24mm Probe. This innovative lens gives the effect of objects just a few centimetres from the lens shrinking and appearing far more distant.\n\nLastly, to light this scene, I employed a pair of Godox lights, each covered in red and green gel for a hint of color contrast.Part of my Architecture In Music collection, exploring the spaces inside musical instruments.",

The scratches on that surface actually go every which way, but the ones that get exposed in the photo are only the ones running perpendicular to the imaginary radial lines out from the point of reflection of the two lights used in this shot (those reflection points are hidden behind the keys), since that\u2019s the only orientation that\u2019ll reflect light back towards the lens from each of those points on the nameboard.",

Get into a longer event, like marathon, and I've been told (by medical lab technologist with first-hand knowledge) that some parts of a blood profile at the immediate end of the marathon look similar to a heart attack patient. But then within a half an hour the blood looks pretty normal again. This is because one of the major effects of training is to allow the body to become really good at handling stress, and to tolerate it, and then to recover quickly from it. Get into really long events, like the Tour de France, where the body can never really recover for weeks, and probably we can't say quite the same thing.",

The timing of the Olympics (late summer) is hard for most distance running athletes to peak their training since the season starts quite a bit earlier in the year.  Usually it's the sprinters that go for world records in track events at the olympics.",

It causes one to infer that women are closer athletically to men than you might have believed. Both of which are false. Some context was in order. Her achievement is still spectacular it just wouldn\u2019t have garnered much interest without the inane comment that went along with it. Bravo to the poster for triggering a response.",

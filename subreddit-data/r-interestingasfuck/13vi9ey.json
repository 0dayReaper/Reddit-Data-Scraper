You can leave your bike parked at the train station unlocked and expect it to be there when you return.  One time I even forgot a computer mouse in the basket, and not only was it still there a day later, somebody had put a disposable umbrella over it to protect it from the rain.  \n\nThe streets are immaculate as well.\n\nThe food was my other favorite part.  I had a katsu lunch counter next door and I could get a full pork cutlet, rice, salad, Miso and a little appetizer for $6.  The guy I think thought because I was a big American that I needed more food, so I actually noticed that every time I went the pork got a little bigger.  One day another guy comes in and orders it and I see mine is actually like twice as big.  \n\nIt's also super convenient to use the train to go anywhere you want, everywhere except the most rural areas",

I didn't expect to see giant anime advertisement posters all over the place...but I did. However, it's worth noting that I mostly visited areas in easy reach of the Yamanote line.\n\nI think calling it fringe gives the wrong impression. Like, lets take goth culture in the US. That's \"fringe\", yet it's also everywhere and there are stores catering to it all over the place. Even being fringe, it isn't unusual...and I feel anime culture in Japan is more widespread than goth is in the US. Certainly more commercialized.",

People who don't really know much about anime probably assume it's just a children thing (like cartoons in the West are thought of), and people who *do* know a lot about the anime industry know that it's not really aimed at average adults. Just basic knowledge of the time slots most anime tend to air in Japan will tell you all you need to know, really.\n\nI'm sure there are *some* misinformed people who think it's really widespread, but I don't think very many. And that goes for any foreign culture really, someone will always overestimate their knowledge of it. Heck, for the exact reverse example, there's a famous Japanese streamer who likes watching Western shows and thought [iCarly and Victorious were serious, adult romcoms that tons of Western adults loved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OBj8YzOJY8) (they're random Nickelodeon shows for teens/kids, if you're unfamiliar).",

The type people into anime are into, most people there would not be aware of. They either come on at like midnight on some less popular channel or never air on TV and people have to seek them out. That said, they obviously do have enough into that there for there to be an industry around it, though obviously helped by interest outside of Japan too. \n\nManga is more popular though since they can read it on the subway and it's light reading unlike a book.",

It isn't like a switch, it doesn't hold one state or the other, it has to have a constant voltage across it to hold the non-detault state. So in your case, the default was transparent.\n\n\nUsually, like in the conference room situation, you want the default state to be the one most used since the other state uses electricity. So if a conference room is normally going to be transparent, it'll use less power to have it be transparent as the default.\n\nWhen these are put in a situation like this bathroom, you want them to be the opaque default for the obvious reason that a loss of power or malfunction doesn't make them unusable.",

But they are switched with the voltage and hold the state they were in:\n\n\u201cThey remain there all by themselves until the voltage is reversed, causing them to move back so the window turns transparent once again. No power is needed to maintain electrochromic windows in their clear or dark state\u2014only to change them from one state to the other.\u201d\n\n[Source](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/electrochromic-windows.html)",

We believed that the glass could be ATAM or AOAM (assigned transparent/opaque at manufacture), and as someone who is *cis*parently opaque and not interested in changing my opacity I was willing to believe that that was true. But now we've learned more, that opacity is altogether more complex than we originally believed.",

A few had the old-style \"hole in the floor\" squat toilets, which takes some getting used to (but if you think about it, it's a zero-contact system that can be perfectly hygienic).\n\nPublic toilets in Mexico and elsewhere in Central America are often *astonishingly* dirty. And I do mean absolutely, appallingly,  turds-on-the-floor filthy.\n\nThe US is a mixed bag. Europe is usually good too. Even if you have to pay \u20ac0.70, it's almost certainly a pleasant experience.\n\nYou have subscribed to /r/internationalshitting",

I've never been in a bathroom where you can't flush the paper and didn't know that was common in the Philippines, I was so taken off guard when I had to wash my ass and throw the paper in a trash can in the stall. Also when I was on the beach there eating at a tent restaurant thing I had to use the bathroom which was in some dudes house and I had to our a bucket of water in the toilet to flush it since they didn't have running water. It was definitely an experience using the bathroom over there!",

I tried to ask every place I stumbled to for their restroom. The guy at the CVS listened to me complain about food poisoning then quickly let me know the toilets were only for employees. If I had less decorum I would have dropped trou and taken a dump right there, but alas.\n\nEventually I get to a little restaurant. \"Bathrooms for customers only!\" a sign said. So I pretended everything was fine, painfully sat, and ordered a random menu item. Then, as nonchalantly as possible, I ask for the bathroom key.\n\nI get in there (the whole room was maybe 3' wide and 4' long and totally filthy) and just barely get my pants down before all hell broke loose. It was a nightmare of splatter.\n\nThen, I realized with great horror, there was no toilet paper. There were no paper towels. The dispensers were empty. Not even any soap. So I had to sit there and wash my ass with water and my hand. Someone bangs on the door. I had nothing to dry with, so in that teeeeeeny space, all I could do was dry my poor ass with my own cardigan, which I threw away from exasperation. \n\nI walked out and it was the owner of the place banging on the door because he \"didn't want nobody shooting up in there.\"\n\nI angrily yelled that he didn't have a square of TP or PT in there, so he looks at his workers and they all laughed. \n\n\"Hope ya didn't hafta wipe!\" He shouted as I left, having paid for a gyro I was never gonna take. \n\nFuck cities",

Make a public restroom out of stainless steel that can withstand the combined fury of a thousand junkies and delinquent teenagers. Not ultra high-end gimmick glass.",

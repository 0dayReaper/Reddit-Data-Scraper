We tie shock tubes with blasting caps on the ends to it and those initiate the bulk explosives inside the holes. It's mostly useful because it detonates very quickly so you can light off all your holes at practically the same instant. The blasting caps it lights off are on delays, like 0ms-&gt;several seconds and we control our blasts that way.\n\nWe also use heavier weight det cords (more explosive material per foot of cord) to do the blasting from time to time. The stuff in this video is definitely heavier weight, probably 50-400 grains/ft.",

The tube connects to a blasting cap at the feet of the dummy. That's why it's not consumed by the flash.\n\nThat's also why the explosion begins at the feet and goes up because it's wrapped that way around the body. This is also why there is a slight delay in the head being removed.",

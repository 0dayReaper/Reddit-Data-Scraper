It just blew my mind because, I can understand if their parents were simply poor, but becoming poor because you choose to have so many kids? Why not give your kid a leg up in this world if you have the means to? \n\nYeah, in the grand scheme of things, it isn\u2019t some huge deprivation to all end up as accountants and nurses who spent all their childhood taking care of siblings (instead of sports or going out). But if you could have had fewer kids, and giving each one way more, why not? \n\nAnd if everyone was still having huge families where each child was taught they need to take zero risks with their lives because they can\u2019t afford it, we wouldn\u2019t have the society we have now. It isn\u2019t fair that kids of wealthier smaller families get to take more risks than others, but it is also how we got to where we are now.",

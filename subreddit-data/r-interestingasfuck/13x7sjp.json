(only present if there is an object to push of)\n\ncentripetal is also being pushed on the water inside the bottle, until it leaves the tip where there is no bottle to pass on the force, leaves only the centrifugal (which is always present for something spinning)",

And it is not the same as centripetal force. Centripetal force is the force that keeps things on their circular trajectory (as seen from the outside, aka inertial frame). \n\nIf the centripetal force is missing, the mass is going on a straight path (observed from the inertial frame). But observed from the rotating frame, the object is accelerated by the centrifugal force (and then the Coriolis force), if the centripetal force is missing.",

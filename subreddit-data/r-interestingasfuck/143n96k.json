So us having to breathe out on ascent is because our lungs are already at normal volume at depth, if we didn't exhale, our lungs would explode.",

                            "comment": "Technically, a freediver can get the bends but it is insanely rare.\n\n*Read just this paragraph for a real simple explanation* the rest is a bit more technical. Free divers could at most, only absorb into their blood the amount of oxygen in a single breath of air (about 0.5 litres). SCUBA divers have around 2400 litres of air they could potentially breath. So in theory they could absorb almost 5000 times more oxygen into their blood. This is a super simple explanation and is not the real reason, below I go into how it is more to do with pressure and time of exposure, but this simple description gives a small idea why.\n\nThe risk of getting the bends is primarily related to two factors. Time of exposure to pressure and the partial pressure of nitrogen in your lungs. A less relevant factor (at least for most situations) is the surface area of interaction in your lungs.\n\nAt sea level, the partial pressure of N2 is about 0.8 bar, at 10 metres it is 1.6 bar, at 20 metres it is 2.4 bar and so on. At higher pressures, it absorbs more into your blood in your lungs. On a side note, at depth, air that has the normal atmospheric 21% oxygen actually becomes toxic, hence why tech divers actually will use reduced oxygen mixes. They target a partial pressure of around 1.3 bar (so at 100 metres depth, the air may only be about 11% oxygen, deadly at sea level).\n\nSo divers get the bends because they absorb more N2 into their blood due to the increase in nitrogen solubility in their blood stream at pressure. They also spend longer at this depth. So they absorb more. When they ascend too quickly, it comes out of solution and becomes a gas due to the lowering pressure of their body closer to the surface.\n\nA free diver has one of the same problems as a SCUBA diver. The partial pressure of N2 in their lungs increase and is more readily soluble in their blood. However, the time of exposure is vastly lower. The other thing, that normally isn't considered is, a free divers lungs compress, just like the bottle. This creates a smaller surface area for the nitrogen to interact with blood, so less is absorbed.\n\nFree divers who have come down with the bends generally have all done many dives in a row, increasing their exposure time.",

Is there a small air cylinder everyone has on ascent or would it literally be, take a breath in the boat and just hope like hell you have enough to get up and if so, is there some kind of airlock to escape from?\n\nI only ask, because I would assume the air pressure inside a submersed sub is similar to that at sea level, if that was the case, you don't need to exhale on ascent, unless you were staged in an airlock or breathed compressed air on the way up.\n\nYour training situation however, yeah, breathing from an air cylinder at depth then swimming up definitely needs exhalation on ascent.",

The day before, I had spent a lot of time in a pool and had a little bit of water in my ears. While I was diving, I was having an insanely hard time equalizing the farther down we went. I probably attempted the vasalva around 50 times before I gave up and went back to the surface. Once I was on the boat, I realized my nose was gushing blood like a water hose. You can definitely hurt yourself if you're not careful haha.",

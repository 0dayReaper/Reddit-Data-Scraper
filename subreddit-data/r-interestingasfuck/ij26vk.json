    "postText": "####Posts must be interesting as fuck (IAF)\n\nThis is a purely subjective rule. Just because you find something IAF does not mean it belongs here. It's impossible to define what *is* IAF, but for a general idea browse the [top posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/top/?t=all) from this subreddit. It's easier to define what *isn't* IAF, here are most of the things that are NOT IAF.\n\n___\n\n###The content of a post (image/gif/video/article) and title must be interesting and interchangeable. The title must describe the content of the post. A post which has the content of a portrait of Albert Einstein with the title listing all of his accomplishments is not interesting as fuck, the content must show those accomplishments. The content of the post must show/depict what the title says.\n\n___\n\n**Things that aren't IAF**\n\n* mildly interesting things, kinda interesting things, interesting things\n\n* Social media screenshots, or screenshots in general. \n\n* No unnecessary sound\n\n* Memes, funny things, edgy content\n\n* Things that are purely cute\n\n* Things that are NSFW\n\n* Click bait, \"Top 10 best X\"\n\n* Just because something is old does not inherently make it IAF.\n\n* Hold your phone a certain way to see an image, or shake your head to see an image, or light mod/dark mode pictures\n\n\n\n*Note: Breaking this rule usually just means your post gets removed. (extreme violations, as in you have no idea what belongs here will get you perma banned)*\n\n____\n\n\n####**Titles Must be descriptive**\n\nTitles should describe the content of the post. If you're going to claim facts/interesting as fuck stuff in the title the image/gif/video/article/content should show that claim in some way. Titles like \"Wow, this is awesome\", \"top 10 best posts EVER\" will get you banned. This isn't a click bait subreddit. Titles that \"piggy back\" off of other posts, like \"Since we're posting Mcdonalds....\" will also get you banned. You also shouldn't include where you're cross posting it from, just throw a source link in the comments. \n\nWe don't need unnecessary information in the title, just describe what you're posting.\n\n*Note: Breaking this rule will get you a temp ban in most cases (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban).*\n\n___\n\n####**If needed provide a source**\n\nIf you can't completely explain why the content of the post is IAF please comment with more explanation. If your post claims something that most everyone can't easily confirm from reading your title and viewing your content please provide some type of proof of what you claim. Do not claim ownership or creation of something you did not create. Do not post false or misleading information\n\n*Note: Breaking this rules will get you perma banned in most cases. *\n\n___\n\n####**Don't spam**\n\nPretty self explanatory, don't post spam, don't spam the subreddit with many links. If you're solely posting to promote yourself/sell something you will be banned.\n\n*Note: Breaking this rule will get you permabanned.*\n\n___\n\n####**No gossip or tabloid type material**\n\nThis isn't the place for celebrity news, or general \"TIL\" type posts. \n\n*Note: Breaking this rule will get you temp banned in most cases (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)*\n\n___\n\n\n####No text on images/gifs/videos\n\nIn most cases text on an image is useless. It can be put into the title or into the comment section. Text on gifs is sometimes useful, but still preferred to put information into the title and/or into the comment section. This also encourages discussion. There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly dates or little labeling on images/gifs/videos. Youtube videos are not allowed \n\n*Note: Breaking this rule will get you temp banned (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)*\n\n___\n\n####**Be Civil**\n\nIt's perfectly fine to disagree with anyone about most things, but there is no need to insult the person. Debate/discussion/talk about the idea/content, not the person. If someone is arguging in bad faith, concern trolling, baiting, general trolling, or just being a rude individual REPORT THEM, DO NOT ENGAGE with them. \n\n*Note: Breaking this rule will get you at minimum temp banned, the more offenses/worse they are means the longer the ban (combined with other broken rules, or multiple offenses will mean a longer temp ban or permanent ban.)*\n\n____\n\nOther things to note:\n\n* If the moderators feel you/your post(s)/your comment(s) are harming the subreddit they will be removed.\n\n* This sub filters new users in order to remove spam. If you are a new reddit user, please gain some karma and wait before posting. This is to prevent spam and new users who don't understand reddit\n\n* The rules are final, there is no debating them, doing so could increase your ban.",

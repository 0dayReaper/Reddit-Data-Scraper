The elephant continued to follow his master\u2019s commands until they reached one hole where the elephant would not lower the log into the hole but held it in mid-air above the hole. When the mahout \\[elephant driver\\] approached the hole to investigate, he found a dog sleeping at the bottom; only after chasing the dog away would the elephant lower the post into the hole.

It's like training a horse to help with tasks--horses aren't *quite* domesticated, and they very well can kill you in a fit of pique, but they can still figure out \"I get treats if I do the thing\" and then choose to consistently do the thing. Horses can also be horribly abused, but that's not a requirement for training.",

His neighbours started to wonder about the big flock of crows making an almighty racket on and around his yard and went to check and that saved his life. Crows can be surprisingly friendly, and there are cases where they start to bring you gifts if you feed them.",

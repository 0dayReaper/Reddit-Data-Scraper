There are a bunch of reasons why there are only 5 maglev lines in the entire world and why those lines are just single lines and not inside an interconnected system. Other than the fact that maglevs are expensive (either for the customer or the tax payer), it is also very prone to disturbances.\n\nThe question is if it is worth the high additional costs and lower reliance to have trains going at 430-500 km/h rather than HSR at 300 km/h and in basically all cases it isn't worth it. Maglevs can only travel on the tracks specifically built for them and those tracks are very sensitive to disturbances. On the other hand, in an emergency situation you can reroot a high speed train on another track at just an increase of travel time but don't have to completely shut down the system while a problem is present.",

Needs proper ventilation like any other greenhouse if you have hot summers. \n\nIt has a solar powered ventilation fan at the top to push out hot air, this also draws in cooler air from the lower windows and (soon to be) door with operable screen. Depending on where you live you can also hang some shade cloth on the south side in the heat of the summer to create a shade structure! Basically works like a normal greenhouse so its good to look up best practices in your area",

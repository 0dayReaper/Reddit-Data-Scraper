While I was there I went to check out the zoo, as I try to do in every place I visit. I was hyped to see the gibbons and cats and the red panda was actually awake, too. One of the memories I left with was of the Gorilla exhibit. They're was a new baby, I think around 5 months old, that was out in the exhibit with adults for limited periods and I took note of the large male in there being especially tender and and nurturing with the baby. A YEAR OR SO LATER that same gorilla got shot for dragging some unattended kid around by his ankle.",

When you lay a thousand eggs, the odds are good that at least a few will survive long enough to mate. When you have just one or two offspring over a long period, you need to stick around longer to protect them longer as a single death has a far greater effect on the chances for your genetic line to continue.\n\nThis can have a reverse effect: the more time the child can spend not looking over its shoulder, the more resources it can put into developing other traits. This may have been important in the development of primates in general, especially apes and most especially humans, who spend an otherwise dangerously long portion of their lives reaching sexual maturity, let alone full adulthood.",

By contrast, chimp nads are huge because their females are promiscuous, meaning that any one male's sperm is likely to be inside the same chimp vag at the same time as sperm from many other males, and therefore evolution favored males whose swimmers could outnumber those of their rivals.\n\nHuman nuts are intermediate in size because we have a nominally monogamous mating system that involves some cheating. And yes I am an expert in testicle evolution, you got a problem with that?",

A very large Silverback will probably weigh around 400lbs, but a large female grizz can weight 700lbs with males averaging about 800lbs and frequently exceeding 1000lbs! \n\nCan you imagine trying to fight a human being that is double your weight in pure muscle and almost double your height? The Silverback has no chance.",

I also don't see how a silverback would be able to get a good enough grip on the grizzly to cause significant harm (would have to be genitals or the throat probably). Grizzlies also have claws longer than the fingers on a silverback which means the silverback loses its arm-reach advantage, so the silverback would likely be quickly injured by getting severely cut up as they don't necessarily have an external defence mechanism other than their raw strength (mostly just skin, muscle and bone, compared to the fat, fur and overall thickness of a grizzly).",

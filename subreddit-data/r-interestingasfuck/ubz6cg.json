Everyone else is saying things like \"oh but it was so expensive\" and \"oh but it took such a long time\". Spoiler alert, if you want something to be done well, that's what it's gonna take. Yes the big dig went over budget and over time, but I think the results are amazing and more than justify the means. At least Boston had the balls to actually pass the motion and pull something like this off, unlike almost all other major American cities.",

You can be cruising 85 in the left lane with the next car behind you 1/2 mile  away and then before you know there\u2019s a car on your ass. What irritates me the most, is that I\u2019ll be in the left lane because I\u2019m passing cars in the middle and plan on switching lanes to allow the nascars to pass me. As soon as there\u2019s enough room for me to safely move over in front of the car I just passed, they are already shooting the gap between us to get around me. Hundreds of times a car has had to be within a foot of me and the car in the middle lane, while going 95+. Like, the chances of possibly killing someone is only 1 tiny miscalculation or mistake away, and for what? \n\nI\u2019ve lived no more than 10 minutes away from 95 almost my entire life and have learned that you almost have to be both aggressive and defensive driving on 95. To blinker to switch lanes well in advance. To get past a flock of semis as soon as safe to do so, since those fuckers will be driving like their on the speedway passing each other.  And to try and not drive much more than hour on it late at night. The only times I\u2019ve come close to falling asleep at the wheel is coming back from a trip at night. I\u2019ll feel wide awake and then out of nowhere feeling like I\u2019m fighting to stay awake. Something about how dark it gets in some stretches, mixed with the head lights, reflectors on the road, and absolute flat straight always with nothing but trees almost puts you in a trance. I don\u2019t know how truck drivers do it at night.",

It's an example of making changes for the future, and but expecting everything to be immediate and cheap.\n\nIt really did transform big parts of the city, made whole neighborhoods much more walkable and connected. And it's much better for drivers too. Just all around a great example of reversing terrible infrastructure from the 70s, and doing things the right way, even if it was expensive.",

So we lit 100 full-scale fires in an abandoned car tunnel in West Virginia, analyzing various ventilation configurations.  A 10 megawatt fire equaled a car on fire, a 100 MW fire equaled a tanker on fire.  We pumped an amazing amount of smoke out of the side of the mountain (the old Memorial tunnel, near Beckley, WV).\n\nThe entire purpose of the Big Dig project was to allow the central business district of Boston to expand to its full potential, out to the amazing Boston shoreline, which used to be very underutilized.  \n\nNow Boston is a true world-class city, and the trip from downtown to the airport went from an hour down to 7 minutes.  Tons of new public park space, too.",

            "comment": "&gt; The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), commonly known as the Big Dig, was a megaproject in Boston that rerouted the Central Artery of Interstate 93 (I-93), the chief highway through the heart of the city, into the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) tunnel named the Thomas P. O\u2019Neill Jr. Tunnel. The project also included the construction of the Ted Williams Tunnel (extending I-90 to Logan International Airport), the Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge over the Charles River, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway. Initially, the plan was also to include a rail connection between Boston\u2019s two major train terminals. Planning began in 1982; the construction work was carried out between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007, when the partnership between the program manager and the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority ended.\n\n* [Big Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig) at the English Wikipedia",

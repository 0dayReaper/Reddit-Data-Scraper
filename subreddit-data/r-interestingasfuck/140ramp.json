These cuneiform tablets essentially tell the source story. Marduk, son of Enki and brother of Thoth ushered in the first monotheistic religion. He was known as Amun Ra in Ancient Egypt. It's why \"Amen\" is even said today. The Emerald tablets of Thoth are used for the Bible. Lines taken from them verbatim indicating that Thoth very well could be Jesus himself or its possible Thoth Had a son.",

My grandpa as a child thought it was hilarious to tuck a chicken's head under its wing and lay it down. He would line all of his chickens up like that and they wouldn't move.\n\nI used this method as a teenager to do minor surgery on a duck's infected foot. I covered her head with a towel and she just went to sleep and held still for me.\n\nOne time one of our chickens stepped on the edge of a bucket and it flipped over and trapped her underneath. She just went to sleep and was there for hours before my mom found her, just chilling.",

I can't imagine it has any kind of evolutionary benefit so it must just be a fluke of nature. It isn't like it would ever happen without a human deciding to do it.

If no reinforcement/food access is provided over a period of time, the pecking behavior would reduce in frequency until it is extinguished. Though the pecking behavior is extinguished, however, the response could be recovered if the pink dot is introduced again (spontaneous recovery).",

Now there\u2019s just over 5000 entries in the database, ranging from stuff like the fountain of youth to crazy cosmic horror, end-of-the-world stuff.",

Its likely not punished for wrong answers, only rewarded for positive responses. So if it doesn't clearly see a right answer, it'll try pecking at every circle to see if any get a positive response. \n\nI used to study Animal Behavior, but again this is just an assumption based on intelligence and the situation that we are seeing. Would have to test to be sure.",

Another example of a primary reinforcer is water.\n* Secondary reinforcers require conditioning of (or experience with) some form; a good example of a secondary reinforcer is money.\n* The pink circle is a discriminative stimulus signaling the availability of reinforcement, shorthand is \"Sd\"\n* Any of the other colors are called discriminative stimuli that do not signal the availability of reinforcement, shorthand is \"S-delta\" or \"S\\^\u0394\"\n* This video doesn't show punishment, but there's also what's called a discriminative stimulus for punishment, shorthand for that is \"S\\^DP\"\n* There are some who argue that it's possible to have a discriminative stimulus for the absence of punishment, shorthand \"S\\^\u0394P\", but it's hard to separate this from the two discriminative stimuli for reinforcement basically\n\nFor those interested, this is the field of Behavior Analysis.  BF Skinner is well known as the father of the field of Experimental Analysis of Behavior and the philosophy of behaviorism.

For example, when a human looks at a wavelength we see as orange, what's really happening is that our short wave detecting cells are somewhat activated and our medium wavelength detecting cells are somewhat activated, but neither is fully activated. Our brain interprets that partial signal from both as being a wavelength in between the two, which we percieve as orange. \n\nIt's believed that mantis shrimp can't interpret their vision in that way. Thus, rather than being able to distinguish far more hues than us, they can only distinguish the twelve that they detect directly.\n\nIf you want truly bizarre color vision, look up how cuttlefish can see color despite having only rod cells and no color sensing cone cells at all!",

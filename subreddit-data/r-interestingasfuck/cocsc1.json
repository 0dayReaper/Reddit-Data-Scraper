I've heard of crows in Japan that drop walnuts that they normally can't eat onto the crosswalk in a busy intersection. The cars break the nuts open and then, the birds wait for the light to change before hopping down to collect the food.\n\nOctopi/Octopodes/Octopuses are also extremely smart. There are all sorts of stories about them escaping aquariums with elaborate schemes. I remember hearing about an aquarium in Germany who couldn't figure out why they were missing so many clams. They checked the security footage and the octopus was sneaking out his tank every night for midnight snack and hopping back in when he was done.",

Still, they have tons of cool attributes that have terrifying implications for real sapience:\n\n- instant camouflage/signaling/hypnosis with their chromatophores.\n\n- ability to use tools with their tentacles, and potentially even train them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, since each tentacle has its own \"brain\" capable of rote stuff.\n\n- they see very similarly to us, despite having completely different eye structure. A case of [convergent evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution#Eyes) - and they don't even have the blind spot we do.\n\n- one of the smartest animals in nature, besides things like dolphins and crows. They're extremely good at problem and puzzle solving, opening lids they've never seen before, squeezing through tiny gaps, having the awareness to close an aquarium behind them when they sneak out to avoid suspicion, taking pictures of guests with an underwater camera, etc.\n\nFar as I can tell the main things holding them back from surpassing corvids as prime candidates for sentience is their solitary nature (they don't really interact besides to mate, as you sort of mentioned, though we are discovering a few that [challenge even this idea](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/7/140728-social-octopuses-animals-oceans-science-mating/)), short life spans, and them being aquatic - as far as we know aquatic species have an added barrier to full sentience because they can't make the advances in metallurgy or chemistry that we have without fire. But that is admittedly from a human perspective.",

A *meme* is similar to a *gene*, except that it is not passed on by genetic means, rather it's passed on by mimicking learnable techniques and processes. The ability to build a fire, for example is a meme. Basically all of modern technology is built on memes. In my opinion, the fact that another animal can do this has terrifying implications. Crows seem to be capable of relaying new information to one another quite effectively. Dolphins, too, but crows (like someone said in another comment) are better at manipulating objects and tools than dolphins.\nMoral of the story, be nice to crows. We might be at their mercy some day.",

Fire?\n\nHow are, in spite of being so intelligent, aquatic animals ever going to overcome that intelligence barrier without it? I can definitely see them becoming more advanced up to a tribal hunter gathering, with pre-chemical herbal medicines and maybe even with underwater farming.\n\nIf they can devise a way to make structures using rocks underwater then maybe a rock-based civilisation. I\u2019m no masonry, so if any with better knowledge could comment on the logistics if this is possible. Because for sure they\u2019re not going to have our path of wood&gt;rock&gt;metal, but just rock due to their environment (no trees and metals are impossible to make use of without fire or chemical solutions&gt;which goes back to needing fire again). \n\nProvided they overcame those previous steps, their next step as a species is the means of producing energy to power their civilisation. Electricity and burning heat. Both of which are not suitable underwater. Possibly they could get around it by using underwater volcanoes as geothermal hotbeds for producing energy though.\n\nOfc, just as you said. That\u2019s based of how we became successful as a intelligent species. There\u2019s no guarantee another intelligent species to become space faring, globally dominant and hyper intelligent like us would follow our same path. \n\nIf and when we do disappear from this planet, of which I doubt will last until the expiry date of Earth, I reckon another intelligent species will fill our shoes. The question is, just how?  Will they follow our path perfectly and fit the shoe no problem? Would they rip that path to the shoe to make space for their own way? Or would they never even need to follow our path and bring their own shoe? Who knows, but it sure is an interesting thought to ponder.",

A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.\n\nHowever, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.\n\nMTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.\n\nThe Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.\n\nThe scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say \"Cah\", none could say \"Truck.\"",

If human influence on the potential next mass extinction wasn\u2019t a thing, I could totally see these birds developing the same fine tuned motor skills we have but a million or 2 years from now.  Granted I have absolutely no qualifications on this matter, but their prowess for problem solving has got to be a start to an evolutionary benchmark of intelligent just like us, right?\n\nEdit: octopodes is my favorite plural form of octopus",

Yet I\u2019ve heard the lack of complex neuron connections as compared to human brains is what prevents them from being as intellectually capable as us.

It sounds like my current favorite novel, [\"A Fire Upon the Deep\"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep). You should check it out! \n\nThere is no way I can do the story justice at the moment, here is my quickest tl;dr - Malevolent AI is woken up and wants to reign terribleness, a planet of pack-mind dogs that can use each others senses over vast distances, and run feudal kingdoms and medieval technology - and terrible inbreeding for selective abilities amongst the powerful dog-packs - discovers \"aliens with future technology\" which are really just two humans children with modern technology (by their standards) who have crash landed on their planet. Sentient fern-plants that rely on rolly-pots that store the ferns' long term memory because.. well they are plants. A benevolent AI creates an Frankenstein's monster of a human, but has past memories. There is a crazy fleet-chase over the galaxy happening at different \"speeds of light\"... it is quite a trip of a book too!\n\nI honestly thought you may have been talking about the sequel I have not read yet, \"The Children of the Sky\", when I saw your title.\n\nEdit: typo fixes",

He ends up finding a bear cub and bringing it along, he ties together with a rope so they can learn to get along. They end up getting lost when they flip the canoe or hit a rapids or something I cant remember, and the two spend the rest of the spring and summer together. In the fall though, the bear starts feeling the need to hibernate and leaves the dog to go back to his den. The dog has a really hard life and eventually gets caught by dog fighters, and is forced to fight a bunch of dogs. He is put up agaisnt a bulldog that gets ahold of his neck, but from the crowd a man comes to stop the fights, and it ends up being the trapper who lost his dog in the river. Then they eventually are making the same run again down the river and the dogs finds his bear friend again :') \n\nChild me just had a flashback fuck I love that movie",

They may get comfortable approaching humans for food, and if they get too bold or aggressive, wildlife agencies often kill them. Animals may come also to haunt roadsides, as many people feed them from cars, putting them at risk of becoming roadkill.  \n  \n\nWhat of the wild bears, wolves, and wolverines in places like Romania and Finland, offered food near blinds for photographers within? This has become big business in eastern and northern Europe. The only downside observed so far is that it\u2019s more manufactured than reality: Those photos of bears and wolves hanging out together as \u201cfriends\u201d is only possible because they simply happen to be near so much food they don\u2019t come to blows over it.  \nMoore here on NG: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/07/ethical-wildlife-photography/",

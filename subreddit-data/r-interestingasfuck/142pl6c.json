When a hummingbird awakens from torpor, they are rapidly restarting their metabolic engines, which requires a lot of oxygen. Thus, as hummingbirds awaken, they open their bills so they can inhale deeply to bring in plenty of oxygen to meet their rapidly increasing metabolic demands. I suppose we might think of this as \u201cgasping\u201d for air.",

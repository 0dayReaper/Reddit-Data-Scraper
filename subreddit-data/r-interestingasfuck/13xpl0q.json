About 28% of all freight in the US is on rails, and about 40% of specifically long distance freight is handled by rails in the US.\n\n  Europe (EU) only moves about 18% of their freight via rail, and this figure is of the total and comparable to the \"28%\" noted above for American rail.  Not sure what portion of long distance freight rail makes up in Europe, as I was having a harder time finding more recent numbers on that.  These stats come from government or regulatory bodies.  In both places, trucking is still king, and trucking is expected to continue to grow towards a larger share of total freight shipped.\n\n\n  Interestingly all around the world, rail accounts for 7% of all passenger, and 8% of all freight moved, while making up just 2% of total transport energy demand.",

You have intercity trains (Amtrak) which is awful for many reasons. Commuters trains which generally go from suburbs to a city. Light rail which in the right area is very useful to get from A to B for shopping, dining etc etc. Finally subways which move you around withing a city, they compliment light rail where both exist. \n\nThe US has spread out cities yes but it was mostly our haphazard development that only automobiles could support is why we are here now. Most places don't have an good alternative if you don't have a car. \n\nYou led yourself to the answer Europe has less airports because it has better train sevices.",

You're deliberately talking past my point and ignoring what we're talking about ITT. Long form travel passenger trains would have declined independently of light rail because air travel became cheaper as well as faster. The US has an expansive controlled air space and we would be fools not to use it, especially when it's cost effective to the passenger.\n\nThat has nothing to do with cities' light rail situation or whatever GM did in Detroit.

In order to deliver a research vehicle on this short timeline the engineers just bolted 2 jet engines to a slightly streamlined and rebuilt commuter train.  \n\nFunny enough the company president actually rode in the train at high speeds",

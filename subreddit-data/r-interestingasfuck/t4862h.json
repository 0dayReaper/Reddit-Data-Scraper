We have frequent exercises in Taiwan but we only had one major exercise with the PRC in the last decade. \n\nIt was a surprise when the government announced they were sanctioning Russia, but frankly we should have seen it coming.

There\u2019s a reason why every 19 year old son of Singapore has to sweat his nuts off in the jungle and that\u2019s because of the threats we face as a small country. When Ukraine was attacked, several guys in my unit immediately voiced their support for Ukraine. \n\nWe know the risks of being a small country. We blow a large chunk of the GDP on the military for good reason. It\u2019s the Poisoned Shrimp doctrine at work from good old LKY.",

Within 10 turns of me freeing him, he got mad that I asked him to stop spying on me, demanded that I stay out of city states within his sphere of influence, tried to give me 3 horses and 1 gpt for some oil, and then got mad that I didn\u2019t give him one of my luxury resources for free. Needless to say Jakarta didn\u2019t stay Indonesian for long after that, and once I got the taste, it was only a matter of the dominoes falling. I would have just fucked off to a different planet if you could have stopped being a dick for like 5 seconds, Gajah.",

But in 1987 there was a big movement to encourage parents to apply for a ssn at birth in the delivery hospital. So after that point, knowing where and when someone was born could drastically narrow the likely of ssn they would have.\n\n2011 made them actually  pseudo random instead of just hoping people were applying randomly.",

So, with one column there are 10 choices, if there are two columns the first one can have 10 choices and for EACH of those 10 choices the second column  can present 1 of 10 choices. So, with two columns one can express everything from 00 to 99 which is 100 choices. \n\nThe generalization of this formula is 10^n where ^ = \"to the power of \" and \"n\" = the number of columns.  \n\nFor example if there were 4 columns one could express 0000 to 9999 and 10^4 is 10,000, which how many numbers could be expressed. \n\n\nRegarding SSN, the SSN has 9 digits, following our formula we can represent 1,000,000,000. Since we know there is a finite number of SSN's and essentially a non-finite number of Americans, at some point, we must re-use the numbers.  \n\nFeel free to use this formula any time you like. How man combinations can a lock make? how many different keys can a car have? how many whatever.",

Some stated allowed \u201cfree men of color to vote immediately after the Revolutionary War as long as they qualified under the other regulations.\n\nThis slowly changed throughout history.  It used to be male property owners could vote, then some states lifted the property ownership for whites but keep it for free men of color, then some states did the opposite and restricted the voting rights of free men of color based on ancestry or other random qualifications. \n\nThen after the 15th amendment, which prohibited states from restricting the right to vote based on race, etc. many states found loopholes, \u201cBlack Codes\u201d, most of which were passed at the state or local level in direct response to the 14th and 15th amendment immediately following the Civil War. \n\nThe first \u201cWomen Rights\u201d conference didn\u2019t even happen until 1848.  Men of color who owned land had been voting for over half a century by the point the firm women\u2019s conference even happened. It wasn\u2019t until after the 15th amendment that the women\u2019s suffrage movement really took off. By 1870 women could vote in two territories, Utah and Wyoming, but not in any states. 8 years later the 19th amendment protecting the right to vote regardless of sex was proposed to congress, but would not be ratified until 1919, a full four decades later. \n\nSorry for the rant.

Outside therapist came in and the care was top notch.\n\nBefore that, I had been in one with minimum, barely trained staff and shared rooms. It was nowhere *near* the quality of care that it needed to be. Thankfully, I had enough resources that my family stepped in and petitioned my insurance provider until I was moved to the better home (after which I reported it and sent videos I took to a group that investigates nursing home abuse.)\n\nThe bad home had over 90 Covid deaths. The second had 5 *cases* and 3 deaths. The home you are in makes a HUGE difference to the chances of survival.",

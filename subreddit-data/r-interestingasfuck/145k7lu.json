As a bird owner myself, nothing is worse than an abused bird; they will make your life hell and it's own life will be hell. Here's something I'm going to say here and now: *buy a hand tamed bird from a breeder.* Hand taming birds is hard work with little reward, especially when they're older birds; and it only gets harder if you purchase birds from the pet shop since they've had little to no human contact. Breeder birds are more expensive, certainly, but them being around humans all their lives and hand tamed makes caring for them much easier.",

They don't get any down to speak of and skip straight to pushing out adult feathers. Precocial birds like chickens, ducks, quail, swans etc, are born with thick down and a lot more tools for survival (like a full set of primary flight feathers out of the egg) and will more often than not immediately leave the nest with their parents to do adult stuff. Superprecocial birds exist that are born with full flight feathers and can fly within a day of being born. The rest of them will slowly push out harder feathers that look a lot like adult feathers, but be molting them in stages until they are feathered out with adult plumage. As the new feathers replace the old ones, the blood feathers are more difficult to see past the mix of down and infant weatherproof feathering and the \"scruffy\" looking stage is less drastic. Our little tiel friend had to wait for all the adult feathers to come in all at once, which looks kinda deranged for a bit. The feather pokes through the skin covered in a kind of hard wax layer, filled with blood. As the feather develops, the bird will carefully preen this wax layer away to reveal the feather from the end down. That said, adult birds must still molt to replace damaged and worn feathers once to twice every year. If you want to see some silly looking birds, throw a Google image search for \"badly molting chicken\".",

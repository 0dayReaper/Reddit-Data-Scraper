    "postText": "[Due to recent API changes announced by Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/), r/interestingasfuck will be joining the 48 hour subreddit blackout starting June 12th which extends through June 14th. Reddit\u2019s API changes affect more than 3rd party apps. To name a few, the API changes also affect NSFW and 18+ tagged content not being available via the new API, the helpful (and unhelpful) bots, users with accessibility limitations such as the visually-impaired, and potentially moderation tools and RES. During this time, r/interestingasfuck will be put into private mode. You **will not** be able to view r/interestingasfuck, nor have the ability to submit posts and comments. The moderation team will be monitoring the situation and will re-evaluate after the initial 48 hour period. In the event the blackout is extended, please visit the desktop version of r/interestingasfuck, where a status update will be left via a custom private subreddit message. \n\nIf you are interesting in more detailed information about this visit these posts:\n\n#[Reddit CEO /u/spez will be hosting an AMA on *June 9th* (time unknown) about the latest API updates, including accessibility, mod bots, and third-party mod tools](https://reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api//) Click the link to read it.\n\n* [Brief summary of events and the current plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf)\n\n* [One of the largest 3rd party app's ev, Apollo's initial thoughts after reddit announced their API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3)\n\n* [An open letter on the state of affairs regarding the API pricing and third party apps and how that will impact moderators and communities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7)\n\n* [Reddit's Recently Announced API Changes, and the future of the /r/blind subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2)\n\n* [Apollo Dev's farewell post answering common questions about the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/)",

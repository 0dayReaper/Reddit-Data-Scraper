I've always been a fan of his and then seeing him in person made me for the first time stop in my tracks. He was a  really cool guy from what I got to experience atleast in the professional atmosphere. He was not fussy at all. It was funny hearing over the radio though \"Mr. Perlman is enjoying his cigar and I dont want to disturb him just yet. Will walk him on set when he's done.\"",

We said he was welcome to play and he laid a quarter down on the edge and went off to get drinks. When signaled to him when our game was up and he came over to play doubles with a cool older woman against my buddy and I. I can\u2019t remember who won, or really how many games we played, but we started taking tequila shots and were laughing and talking shit about pool. Never really brought it up that I knew who he was, never asked for an autograph or anything. I just said it was nice to meet him and we all had a fucking great time.",

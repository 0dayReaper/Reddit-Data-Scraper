It's crazy that they were one of the companies behind the development of the ARM processers.\n\n&gt;The acronym ARM was first used in 1983 and originally stood for \"Acorn RISC Machine\". Acorn Computers' first RISC processor was used in the original Acorn Archimedes and was one of the first RISC processors used in small computers. However, when the company [ARM] was incorporated in 1990, what 'ARM' stood for changed to \"Advanced RISC Machines\", in light of the company's name \"Advanced RISC Machines Ltd\" \u2013 and according to an interview with Steve Furber the name change was also at the behest of Apple, which did not wish to have the name of a former competitor \u2013 namely Acorn \u2013 in the name of the company.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_(company)",

After we moved we had the far superior Acorn Archimedes and I remember playing Crystal Rainforest in Year 2, but we used them in other classes righ up through Year 6, by which time we also had a 486 on Windows. We would sometimes take a trip across the field to the local secondary school which had a computer room full of BBC Micros, though they had been replaced by PCs by the time I moved up. They had another two computer rooms though, one was full of Acorn RISC PCs for the first couple of years I was there, before being replaced with Windows PCs. I got my hands on a RISC PC in about 2003 and had a poke around, very modular design.  A sort of forgotten technology that played a huge part in many people\u2019s upbringing and introduction to IT, yet most don\u2019t realise those school computers are the direct ancestor of all those pocket ARM devices that rule their lives in the 2020s\u2026",

Then there was x86/CISC dominance for a while but during the initial pre-iphone Phone/PDA era you started to hear more about Acorn/ARM and their newer chips (Which had been used since the 90s in dumbphones) with the HTC line of Phone-PDAs and the Apple Newton.",

I showed how far I could tip it over without it falling, because it isn\u2019t solid all the way through. Even if the top of the bus is full of people, the engine, drive, axels, wheels, etc. still make it extremely heavy at the very bottom.\n\nNote: it also took me an hour with an animated illustration, to explain why there were black bars on the top and bottom of some wide-screen movies when they showed them on TV.",

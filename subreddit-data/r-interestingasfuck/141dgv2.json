When the Swiss people decide to flip a bird to somebody, they do it *with style*.\n\nAlso, the [museum is here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Museum_of_Horology).. but it's a pretty remote area of Switzerland, but then again, it's pretty close to the French border.. so Not as good for somebody from Germany, but maybe interesting for a Frenchman.",

That spring produces power to drive a gear train. From there it's a system of gears, cams, cranks, and linkages to drive the bellows to produce constant air pressure, move the bird, and drive the whistle piston back and forth to change pitch.\n\nIts a lot of very simple parts put together in a complex, but very tidy package where everything has to be timed very precisely.",

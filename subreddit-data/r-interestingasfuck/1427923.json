He turned out to be THE BEST dog, but I credit that to the older dog we had at the time. She was incredibly well trained and she literally took him in as her own. She basically potty-trained him for us. When he was very small if he went near something she perceived as danger she would pick him up by the scruff and put him somewhere safer. If he tried to get into something or tear something up she would stop him. She parented him better than most humans parent their kids, it was amazing to see.",

The behavior stems from being cloned and brought into a world with no social development or training from their parents / previous generations. They are wild rule-less savages that will eat each other at the smallest sign of injury. There is no class, structure or code amongst them other than simple pecking order. They come to find out that these raptors behave nothing like their predecessors and the research done on their behavior is likely to be inconclusive . Technically it\u2019s as if they\u2019re completely different animals.",

It is shaped by genetics, environment and path dependency. That's why bonobos and chimps have very different behavior despite they are genetically very similar \n\nMoreover check the order among chickens. They act similar to raptors. They literally eat each other. \n\nIt is a good thought experiment but honestly it is not necessarily the case.",

I strongly recommend it. It questions all our understanding of early human societies and the necessity or evilness of hierarchies. His conclusion is that there is no conclusion and these things are very fluid",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.",

One of which is of course aggression. \n\nBut dogs will growl when they are in pain/discomfort too. (Probably what's going on in your case.)\n\nDogs also growl when they are *playing*. What's important here is the body language. *Usually* when dogs play the tail is up, probably wagging and ears are \"perky\", not flattened or back.\n\nDogs are complex, and most of their communication comes in the form of body language. Growling and other vocalizations are *often* warnings, but not always. \n\nFor example dogs bark when a stranger is at the door \"hey I'm in here and you should leave!\" or dogs bark when the owner comes home \"I'm excited to see you! Yay!\". If you know the dog you know it's different barks. Same with growling.",

It was really odd and scary at first, but I know him well now. Most of his growls are for attention, out of annoyance or when he's playing. When we play tug or war, he sounds demonic. He has never shown any aggressiveness towards humans.",

We were clingy and loved petting and smelling her. We loves carrying her around. Of course we were always sure to be careful but she grew up to be a sassy little bitch, lmao. She's scared of taking baths and whenever we want to bathe her we have to be extra courageous 'cause she bites us when we try carry her to the bathroom. I think we used to play with her paws too but trimming her nails is a nightmare, lol! She gives thay gnarly look so we have to be extra careful. All that but we still love her so much!\n\nBut I feel we had so much mistakes growing her up. I personally feel it's such an incredibly huge responsibility to care for dogs. We weren't able to socialize her due to other priorities, now she's somewhat a little bit aggressive to other humans. She doesn't bite them but it feels to me like she knows when you're scared so she barks at other people she's not familiar with.",

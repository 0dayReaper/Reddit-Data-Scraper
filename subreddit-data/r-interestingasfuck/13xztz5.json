I'm a veteran and believe me, I have worked every Veteran's Day and Memorial Day as middle management at a corporation while upper management that has never served in the military get the day off to hangout at the beach every year while I hold down the fort but they have fliers, posters, commercials, and appreciation days promo everywhere. Trust me, if they made Pride a Federal Holiday with a paid day off most of the LGBTQ+ community would be at work watching their straight bosses party. That's exactly the kind of appreciation corporations have.",

Forget about what the population thinks for a minute. In a country like SA, corporations would be banned from doing business for promoting illegality. As you said, it all comes down to the money aspect, but imo it's more toeing the country's laws to be able to continue to do business rather than kowtowing to the mob mentality.",

An example of this is the various non-profits made by billionaires to evade taxes and manipulate governments through lobbies.\n\nOnly state run organizations can be truly non-profit, because the money they use doesn't depend on the profit of their donnors to be applied (since the government prints it's own money), while independent non-profits depend on the profit of the corporation that donates to it or the salary of workers that donate to it (that also depend on the profit of the corporation, because if a worker isn't profitable enough, they are fired).\n\nA better question could be: Is ethic universal? If not, can any corporation be unethical? Because they follow the ethics of their owners, so in a sense they are ethical, even if they pollute the air and scorch the earth. The question now is if any super rich person could be allowed to have his ethics determine the actions of an entire organization with impacts on millions of lives.",

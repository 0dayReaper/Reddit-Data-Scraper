Like, in terms of numbers in Celsius you're correct. In terms of warmth...it depends? \n\nLike in Fahrenheit thats only about half the temperature. In Kelvin it is a less than 10% decrease. How does going from 20 -&gt; 2 degrees celcius feel? Does it feel 1/10th as warm? Someone in the US would ask if it feels half as warm? I'm guessing temperature is linear in Kelvin meaning that it is literally less than 10% colder in a physical sense, but in terms of how we interpret temperature through feeling then its subjective?",

In between, the wind blows over a large area from a northerly direction.\n\nThe colder the air above, the more vertical air movements and the more chance of heavy rain. Especially when the air comes from the sea, and therefore contains a lot of moisture, such a cold upper air can result in hard rain with thunderstorms, grain hail and snow. During such showers, the mercury can drop more than five degrees in a matter of minutes, sometimes even just above freezing. Between showers, the sky is often deep blue and the weather warms up quickly to around 10 degrees.\n\nBelgium here. In our language we speak of \u201cApril grills\u201d , and grills in the meaning of erratic.",

So, you want a male for doing this fancy stuff. \n\nMale Harris's hawks are very submissive. They are born into very matriachal family units of 5-10 females; he's the only male. A matriarchal Harris's hawk is about twice the size of this male. The family pack-hunts from the air then moves across the desert floor chasing up prey. Oh, if the male \"disappoints\" the family...you can look for traces of him in the matriarch's poop. They are VERY BAD ASS even for raptors.",

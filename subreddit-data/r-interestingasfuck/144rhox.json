NOT where you\u2019d think GOLDEN eagles would ever be. \n\nIt turns out we\u2019re on the migration path so once in a very long time they pass by.\n\nThere is a small bridge over a canal I\u2019m on and pigeons nest under it. They sit on my neighbors roof all day. I barely noticed them and wasn\u2019t looking at them. Suddenly the flock _exploded_ off the roof \u2014I didn\u2019t see it, _I heard them_! \n\nI look up and a few fly across the canal, and uncharacteristically, right at a large, very old tree 10 feet from the second story covered porch Im sitting on. There\u2019s a crash sound with branches breaking.  Then there\u2019s a sound like a low \u2018whuff\u2019 that actually scared me for a second. In the next second I realize the \u2018whuff\u2019 was a golden eagle taking off, after missing a grab of a pigeon.\n\nHe flys effortlessly at slightly above my eye level past me, cocks his head for a second and makes eye contact with me, and Im instinctively frozen. \n\nI am telling you this guy must have though for a second, can I eat him? He knew he was the top of the food chain predator. \n\nUnbelievable how big it was and I don\u2019t care who you are, you would have froze for the moment too.\n\nTo say these are majestic birds of prey is surely true, but the more appropriate word from my brief experience \u2014awesome. Not the colloquial \u201cyeah thats awesome\u201d more like, ohhhh\u2026 there is a God (of the sky) and I think I just saw him.\n\nTheres a row of 40 foot evergreens at the end of my lot, and he _effortlessly_ shot up 70 degrees with a single beat of his wings and cruised over it. Just infinitely dominant in his environment.\n\nNot something I\u2019ll ever forget, wish I caught it on camera for the world to see. A one in a zillion probability of happening.\n\nGolden eagles, and really all raptors are beyond amazing. Though golden eagles seem to take the cake in beauty, power and amazingness.",

Not even 10 min in Hoonah when me and my brother freak out over seeing a eagle perched at the top of a dock pole. Took half our pictures from our disposable cameras thinking it was a rarity. We don\u2019t see them a lot in pa maybe once a year or so unless you know where a nest is. 35 min later I\u2019m looking at this deep green from the pine tree and they are dotted with what seems like a unnatural white spots my uncle then says they are all eagles and I shit myself. Their heads are whiter then I thought and there were so many I was just floored. Would recommend Alaska to anyone who can make the trip even if it\u2019s a cruise cause the beauty of it is just amazing and I was 14 and didn\u2019t appreciate anything truly but not Alaska that shit was too much to ignore.",

Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.",

I'm imagining an eagle standing facing one of those pyramid letter charts while a human in a lab coat takes notes on a clip board but I'm genuinely curious. Can we tell just by studying the eye how the brain processes the information? Is it like the shape of the lense in relation to the pupil?",

If I had to guess I'd say it's some variety of [midshipman fish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midshipman_fish) , they're all over the beaches during the time of year they lay eggs. The tail color doesn't look exactly right, but the shape is similar. \n\nI actually have a [picture](https://postimg.cc/1gp5TxsZ) of a midshipman that I pulled out of a tidepool like two weeks ago! To me the way the tail looks is similar to the creature the eagle catches in the post, but I definitely could be wrong it's just a guess.",

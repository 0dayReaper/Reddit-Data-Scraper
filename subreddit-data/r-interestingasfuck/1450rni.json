He said I could only leave if I got another busser to cover my shift, so a kitchen guy helped me wrap it with paper towels and scotch tape and put a glove on it for the rest of my shift. \n\nBut now I've got this scar on my fingertip as a nice reminder of how not to be treated and how not to treat my employees.",

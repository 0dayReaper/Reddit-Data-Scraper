Even if we could do that, we would need a way to generate resources on other planets that just straight up do not exist.\n\nThis means our \"grand plan\" would be to flee a world of changing climate that is becoming inhospitable to go to another planet that is ALREADY inhospitable and try to make it livable. The technology to do this would be SO MUCH harder to develop than just working toward stabilizing the use of our current planet's resources and practicing sustainability. If we can't even do that, why would anyone think we would be better at both creating those resources from scratch and making THOSE sustainable?\n\nAnd even if we could do those things, I don't think people necessarily realize the gene pool size necessary for the human species to continue on productively in a colony that would be devoid of influxes of new people and supplies. The only way we would be able to pull this off would be to have mass transport at faster than light speeds to earth-like celestial bodies that we could survive on.",

I think you severely underestimate how much work goes into developing a civilization on another fricken planet lol. We can barely even get manned missions to the moon for short periods, and that's still within Earth's orbit.

It is a common practice that actually allows someone to not only increase growth without fertilizing and keeping the tree and ground healthy. The sheets are laying are live seedlings being planted with netting to prevent erosion and encourage growth. The spraying system is called hydro seeding and it is a super nitrogen rich spray with seeds in it that harbors growth of not only grass but any other plants in the area especially trees and at least here in the US it is environmentally friendly, I can\u2019t speak for chinas practice but if you are spending the money to add green space why would a govt poison the ground making it less likely to grow.

It is often used as an erosion control technique on construction sites, as an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. \n\nIf planting a relatively large area, hydroseeding can be completed in a very short period of time. It can be very effective for hillsides and sloping lawns to help with erosion control and quick planting. Hydroseeding will typically cost less than planting with sod, but more than broadcast seeding. Results are often quick with high germination rates producing grass growth in about a week and mowing maintenance beginning around 3 to 4 weeks from the date of application. Fiber mulch accelerates the growing process by maintaining moisture around the seeds thereby increasing the rate of germination.\n\nSource: Wikipedia \n\nBasically, the seeds are sprayed with mulch and nutrients, the seeds sprout and use the nutrients they have with them to get established and put down roots, these roots help fight erosion. Once the plants are established, they start to create soil for other plants by shedding organic matter as they go through their life cycles.",

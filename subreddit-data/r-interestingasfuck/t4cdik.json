They drank it and the majority of them went blind.\n\nEdit: I did some digging and found the passage from the book \"Enemy at the Gates\" where I originally read this. (It's a damn good book if you're into WW2 and the Battle of Stalingrad in particular.)\n\n\"To \\[the Russian soldiers\\], the quest for liquor was a serious pursuit, one which sometimes assumed even more disastrous proportions. Only recently, soldiers of the 284th Division lines had found several cisterns filled with alcohol. After draining them, the Russians found one more cistern brimming with more spirits. Again they drank the well dry, but this time it was wood alcohol. Four men died and countless others went blind.\n\nThe tragedy failed to daunt the appetite of the other troops, some of whom began drinking cologne to ease the terror of living under the brow of Mamaev Hill.\"",

The countries promised to respect the sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine.** Parallel memorandums were signed for Belarus and Kazakhstan as well. In response, Ukraine officially acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state on December 5, 1994. That move met the final condition for ratification of START, and on the same day, the five START states-parties exchanged instruments of ratification, bringing the treaty into force.\n\nAs far as expiration: \n\n&gt; Russia and the United States released a joint statement in 2009 confirming that the security assurances made in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum would still be valid after START expired in 2009.\n\nAs a side note, there have been opposing/parallel claims that western nations agreed not to expand NATO eastward in any way, which some might claim as justification for Russia, since NATO has expanded eastward. This was an assurance made to the USSR (pre-collapse) when Germany reunified, it's much less clear to me that this should have been in effect (even as early as 2002, when Poland joined NATO).",

The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.\n\nThe memorandum included security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. As a result of other agreements and the memorandum, between 1993 and 1996, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear weapons.",

This is not any sort of general mutual defense treaty, which some people are claiming.  Russia is violating this accord right now.  The UK and USA are not.\n\n&gt;  The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and The United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression **in which nuclear weapons are used.**",

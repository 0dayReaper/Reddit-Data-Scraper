Its simply white light minus the paticular color wavelength, which then give us a \"tint\". In other words, this \"color\" is projected. So you could see it from space. Just like you can see a \"blue\" sky from and simultaneously see a dark, transparent Earth from space. That's the allowable light that refracts, so that is what it projects",

                                    "comment": "It's actually due to Rayleigh scattering.  The molecules of our atmosphere are much smaller than the pretty long wavelengths of visible light, but can still cause some scattering that's inversely proportional to wavelength to the fourth power, ie. \u03bb^(-4).  If you look at visible light, blue has the shortest wavelength and red the longest.  That means blue light is scattered the most, and that's why you the sky is blue.  The light that isn't scattered as much means it never reaches your eye from the atmosphere and instead just reaches the surface to hit whatever.  At dusk and dawn when the sun is low on the horizon, the amount of atmosphere between you at the sun is a lot more due to that shallow angle.  So by the time the light reaches you, most of the blue light has been scattered away so you don't see it directly, so you see relatively more of the red.\n\nThat's the basics of it, but there are other factors that can come into play like certain wavelengths getting more preferentially absorbed by molecules in the atmosphere as well as the sun's emission spectrum that isn't constant over all wavelengths.",

I am able to understand that. However, why at the same time, would someone in space perceive it? The amount of atmosphere between them and the reflected light of the earth should remain unchanged.  \n\nI realize I'm not educated on the subject, and am not challenging anyone, but I'm struggling to connect the dots.",

You can only see stuff on the ground (or near the ground, because clouds are pretty low compared to the height of the camera in this picture) because that stuff reflects light. If the light is white, the object will appear white. If the light is red, the object will reflect that red light. Clouds reflect a lot of light so the ones illuminated by the sunset are pretty good at bouncing that red light in every direction. \n\nI've only seen such a vivid terminator in a couple pictures so I assume the clouds have to be angled well to get such a wide band of red illumination. Also vegetation and water won't reflect as much red light so it's probably not very apparent without cloud cover. \n\nHopefully that makes sense and bridges the gap of how that red light is visible in space.",

The red has the longest wavelength thus it\u2019s less likely to scatter and it\u2019s all that\u2019s left.  That\u2019s why when the sun is lower in the sky the light travels through more atmosphere thus scattering most light that\u2019s not red.  So you see red.",

I have a morbid fascination with flat earthers - particularly in understanding exactly what it IS that they believe. one thing in particular that I'm desperate to know is where they think the earth IS if they don't believe in space. where is the flat earth in their theory? what lies outside of it according to flat earth theory?? this is not a question I've ever been able to get a straight answer to in any way shape or form. my brother in law has a friend who believes in it so I got him to text &amp; ask, and the answer was absolute batshit nonsense that didn't even address my question. I just want to know what they believe in instead of outer space oh my god. it drives me crazy. it haunts me",

It\u2019s actually really really interesting. You learn that they\u2019re totally disorganized as a group, with \u201cleaders\u201d being of totally different thoughts regarding their Flat Earth theories. You see how they became so disoriented and disillusioned, you see that they are just normal people, and you\u2019ll eventually feel quite bad for them. They\u2019re mostly just smart &amp; decent people who also happen be uneducated &amp; unable to determine what information is reliable. Others are just in it to sell custom-made flat earth models lol. It\u2019s a fun watch!

So... kinda hard to deny the existence of gravity... and yet they *still* are persistent on just... *not* believing... like blatantly... enough to say that the scientists who made it all are corrupt and working for the government.

They fascinate me and annoy me in equal measure. They can really get under my skin as does any wilful ignorance. Because they use the gish-gallop method of debate, for a while now I have been sticking to one subject in my interactions with them- The Sun.\n\nIf you force them to stick to one subject, something we all have direct interaction and observation with, you can expose the utter stupidity of their stance very easily. It makes no difference to them of course and they are literally incapable of being educated but I think reading such debates and challenges might help a fence-sitter once in a while. \n\nIt drives me crazy too and every time I give up out of frustration I always end up coming back to the subject. My advice is to nail them down on a single subject you understand well and stick to that no matter how much they try to change the subject. \n\nIt's hard to have a debate when they go all *\"But what about NASA/freemasonry/satan/firmament/space isn't real/Van Allen belts/tinfoil spaceship/zoom ships back into view/spinning 1000mph and not flying off/hovering helicopters impossible/illuminati/water is level/astronauts on wires/etc, etc,\"* all after you mention a sunset.",

Most nights when I leave home in the winter, it will be a clear starry night. It always makes me think that maybe it will be a sunny day, a little bit warmer from the sunlight. Like clockwork, the clouds roll in right around sun up, or maybe shortly after. Then it stays cloudy all day, before clearing up again after sunset. Winter in the midwest keeps it cold during the day by not allowing the sunlight's radiant heat, then rips off the blanket at night to make it colder.  \n\nI've never seen this phenomenon represented in weather radar. I'm wondering if it would be visible from space like this sunset is.",

We got up to altitude, the sky was still bright near us, and we could eventually see a thin sliver of the dark sky out East.  There was something strange though.  The sun wasn't just gradually setting, and the sky wasn't slowly shifting from day to night above our headed.  We were flying into the sunset, so it was an accelerated effect.  \n\nI don't know if my eyes were just messing with me, or maybe there was some strange cloud effect that I couldn't see at the time, but it looked like the darkness of the night sky was reaching out to the West.  It looked like there were long, dark tendrils, spreading out towards us.  I'm not just talking about this being along the ground - it was taking place in the sky, much higher than we were in the plane.  I remember there being a pretty vivid contrast between those dark tendrils and the sections of blue sky in between.  It looked almost alien.\n\nIt was absolutely wild.",

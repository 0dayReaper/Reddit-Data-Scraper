Sound travels down the tube as a longitudinal wave and reflects off the end, creating a standing wave as a result of constructive/destructive interference. Concentrated areas of higher pressure cause more propane to be forced out, and areas of lower pressure do the opposite.\n\nAside from being a cool visual demonstration, this sort of thing would be useful to calculate the speed of sound in gases, by multiplying a set frequency by the measured wavelength (distance between two peaks). Would have to get more creative with non-flammable gases, like using schlieren photography, but entirely doable.",

The original apparatus was made using an organ pipe which Reuben pumped gas into at one end and then had drilled holes into throughout the distance of the organ pipe (which mind you this was a wooden organ pipe too \ud83d\ude05) he found then that lighting the gas and playing the organ pipe caused a phenomena similar to the one shown here in the video. Modern adaptations of the experiment were adapted in the 50s and 60s that substituted the difficult wooden organ pipe for easier to use metal or even PVC ones (though the PVC ones can be tricky as you have to be mindful of the heat to not damage the pipe). \n\nThe modern flame tubes work a little different and typically made of two different variations. \n\n1.) a tube that has the gas pumped in on one end (though sometimes also pumped in from the middles), with a open end on the other side that has a small membrane stretched over it (like the one in the video above)\n\n2.) a tube that has instead of a membrane, a audio driver (speaker) of some sort instead mounted to one end.\n\nThe benefit of the speaker format is that you can more easily hook up to some sort of audio driver and play sound through the speaker at a consistent tone. The membrane version works easily enough if a tone like the trumpet being played in this video is played next to it as well, but I find that due to gap often between the instrument and the membrane that you get inconsistency that doesn\u2019t have as nice clear shapes appear on the flame tube.\n\nThe instrument is often used as a means of demonstrating a standing wave in intro physics classes, but in reality that\u2019s not really what\u2019s occurring within the tube. The sound is simply changing the gas pressure within the tube in a consistent manner that causes the \u201cshape\u201d of the sound to appear, but in reality is not a true standing wave. None the less, it still makes for a fun instrument as well you know\u2026 fire and all, and is just fun to mess around with with things like instruments like shown here, or even music, which was super popular on early YouTube videos back in like the mid 2000s into the 2010s. \n\nFunnily enough Reuben\u2019s paper actually was the paper immediately following Einstein\u2019s paper on Special Relativity in the Annalen de Physik in 1905. Which uh yea must have been a hard article to follow in the journal that year lol.",

Bernoulli's principle relates pressure and velocity, and thus volumetric flow (cubic meters per second), thus changing how much gas comes out, and creating the profile of sound wave in the gas. If he played his way up the musical scale and one note created a massive peak, that would be a resonant frequency, but resonant frequencies exist as a property of the structure that's excited, so it would maybe(?) be the frequency of the pipe that you'd be seeing (which isn't even what's happening here). A note \"relative to its own resonant frequency\" doesn't mean anything, or make sense\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens_tube\n\nEdit: gonna edit my comment as I was more wrong than right, and owe OP a bit of an apology. So when you see a defined pattern, that's a standing wave, formed by a combination of the tubes fundamental frequencies. This standing wave is what creates the pressure waves that you see reflected in the flames. These fundamental frequencies will lead to resonant behavior but this is solely from the fundamental frequencies forming a stationary, standing wave",

You're not visualising the sound wave, you're visualising the resonant modes that are activated in the tube as a result of the sound waves. A differently sized tube, or a tube with different boundary conditions would have different activations and resonant modes. When only one major resonant mode is activated, you see a purely sinusoidal pattern matching the boundary conditions of one solution. When you see a weird pattern (there were a few there), that's multiple modes being activated.\n\nThe sound you're hearing is from 20hz to 20khz, travelling at the speed of sound. You can verify to yourself that the frequencies with that speed have much shorter wavelengths than you can see. And of course, sound waves _move_. Stable standing waves, as seen here, are affected by geometry of the structure and the reflections it causes (thus it's resonance)",

I stayed somewhat humble and asked the smartest ones a lot of questions.  Guys and girls with masters and doctorates in niche areas like fan blade noise.  It's a fascinating science.

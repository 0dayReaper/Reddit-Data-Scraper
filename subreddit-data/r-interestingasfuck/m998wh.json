There was no interruption to gas, heat, electricity, water, sewage, or the telephone service they provided. No one inside felt it move.",

When they got back from their vacation, the house next to theirs had been torn down and replaced by an entirely new (old) house. \n\nThere was a historic house down the road that was going to be torn down, so their neighbor had bought the house for $1, then paid to have it moved the mile or so down the road to his lot. They ended up with a much nicer classic home, for a fraction of  the cost of buying a comparable home, and located in exactly the neighborhood they loved. \n\nhttps://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/how-much-does-it-cost-to-move-a-house/",

They planned to demolish it but that would've interrupted phone service for a big chunk of Indiana, which they didn\u2019t want to do.\n\n- EDIT: They lifted the whole building with steam-powered hydraulic lifts, then set it on enormous pine logs. It was moved via hand-operated jacks, which pushed it over the logs 3/8\" at a time. Once the building rolled far enough forward, the last log would be moved to the front.\n\n- The rotation plan was conceived &amp; executed by famous architect Kurt Vonnegut Sr (father of the famous author)\n\n- The feat remains one of the largest building-moves in history.\n\n- The building was demolished in 1963.",

Lauderdale, Florida, they had some major issues with the city\u2019s plumbing, and it became infinitely more difficult because they literally didn\u2019t know where pipes were. Major pipes kept braking and they didn\u2019t even know where the shutoff valves were. They recently put together a task force specifically dedicated to finding and mapping these pipes.",

Although required everywhere, they're predominantly to resist uplift like from a tornado, so they get overlooked a lot in areas not at risk. \n\nI've moved a couple of (smaller) buildings before. One home got hit by a semi truck in the middle of the night that had its brakes fail just uphill. Just moved the house a few inches, sheared off all pipes and anchor bolts, and broke one foundation wall.\n\nWe just jacked it up a couple of feet, rebuilt the wall, and set it back down. \n\nTypically the foundation *is* the beams that support a home, and a building needs to be lifted in many points, and then temporary steel I-beams are used to spread the weight and use fewer support points during the actual move.",

This meant that the businesses would often flood and the sewers would back up during high tide. After the Great Seattle Fire, they regraded up a story so that they would be higher above the water table. There's an interesting tour you can take that goes underground and walks past some of the original shop windows that are now under the street. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Underground",

Especially when done on a large scale. The biggest expense is powerline and communication line raising and lowering.  With the move of an entire town, you lift everything once until all of the buildings are moved.\n\nIn more rural areas of the US house moving is more common as their are fewer utility lines to contend with.",

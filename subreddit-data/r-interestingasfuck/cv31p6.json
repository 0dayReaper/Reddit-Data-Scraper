From what I understand, many people do not like the way that Trump has attempted to take trade out of China. The tariffs he is imposing on China do help some American industries and hurt China\u2019s economy, but China\u2019s retaliation have hurt our economy more than any tariffs have benefited it. It seems like he\u2019s essentially playing a game of chicken with China to see who can take the economic damage for the longest. I\u2019m not sure I approve of his methods, but I personally am glad to see a president who is willing to try to play hardball with China instead of just appeasing them.",

The first character we meet is the last woman in the family to have her feet bound.\n\nIt makes clear that the custom was associated with class, but that therefore it was desirable. Certain roles in society one would be exempted from (manual labour) and certain roles one would be muuuch more suited to (marrying \"up\").\n\nThe lady in question was exceptionally beautiful and graceful, so the family decided to bind her feet and provide for her an education not like the workers', but instead things like poetry, history, and performance. In this way, she will never make a good farm-hand nor bring water from a well, but she will have different opportunities.\n\nOf course, it is not long before a noble officer visits their community. He sees all these country-people with whatever their lives are (all quite clearly different lives than his), but also the remarkably beautiful, graceful lady with bound feet and an intellectual education. \n\nShe does not rush to him, but he makes sure he can meet her and eventually marries her. \n\nIt is just one anecdote for another, but it does make a bit more sense that the binding was done from as-young-as-possible, while feet are small, rather than waiting for marriage. \n\n\"Binding feet of merchant's wives so hey don't run away\" is a very degrading representation of the women in question, but the family's motivation is the opposite: to mark their daughter as special and open possibilities they did not themselves have.\n\nIn these days, I wouldn't like it done. (I've never been to China or a place where it was ever normal). BUT if I lived in China in those days and could either be a labourer or someone invited to a court... I'm sure I would have found the fashion very glamorous. If I was born of nobility but found I was the only one who hadn't had it done... I'm sure I would have felt it unfair.",

They talk about Putin's weaknesses. One of which is that he's in power because the richest men in Russia fear Putin taking their assets. The Magnitsky act, which froze assets from Russian oligarchs in countries all over the world, really hurt Putin because those oligarchs have most of their wealth outside of Russia, in more stable economies. But if Putin going down is all that's necessary to lift those sanctions and regain their assets, he could lose their support and wealth quickly.",

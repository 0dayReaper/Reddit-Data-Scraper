This class of people hiding things from Congress is not unlike what has already happened. The church committee hearings exposed MK Ultra and politicians were pissed. Taking that example specifically, what you had was a group of people who had held jobs in the CIA for decades. A tight knit group that probably felt they could keep america a lot safer if they didn\u2019t have restraints on them. \n\nIt\u2019s not beyond the realm of comprehension that we\u2019ve kept a secret this big for ~70 years. When you think about it it\u2019s even similar to the death of  JFK. There\u2019s a lot of evidence on either side of the isssue but through enough obfuscation and obstruction, no one can really say for sure. That\u2019s exactly how most people feel about the UAP thing now",

I can't talk about the others.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What happened?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 1933, a bell-shaped vessel, about ten meters in size, was recovered in Magenta, northern Italy. It was kept by Mussolini's government until it was recovered by agents of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), an old US intelligence agency, in 1944. The irony is that it predates everything the public has heard about for decades, like Roswell, etc. I was authorized to talk about it by the Department of Defense's prepublication and security review office.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You talk about information concealed for decades: aren't you afraid of fueling unfounded conspiracy theories?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Yes, there's always a probability that it will fuel other unfounded conspiracy theories. The irony is that this used to be a conspiracy theory that turns out to be true.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Have you seen exotic materials with your own eyes?   \n&gt;  \n&gt;I have seen very interesting things that I'm not authorized to talk about publicly at the moment.

The government is issuing responses that are getting less jokey and more, \u201cwe actually did look into this.\u201d\n\nA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is another great way to reveal a \u201csensitive\u201d truth without necessarily looking like the bad guy for keeping said secret.\n\nThat\u2019s just my personal conspiracy theory, I swear everything I see and read lately validates it!",

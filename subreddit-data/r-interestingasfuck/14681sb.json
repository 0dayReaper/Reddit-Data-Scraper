You live off this stuff aside from the obviously not so good prison food, so those lucky enough to have some cash flow are fortunate inside. You can also earn very low pay, like a dollar and change or less an hour, while getting time off as an inmate worker or trustee that can go towards commissarry, if I am not mistaken.  \nOtherwise you have friends and family from the outside put money on your book, you spend like 3x this much on phone cards as well. The jail and prison phone card racket is an absolute sham.",

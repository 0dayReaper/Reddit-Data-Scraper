The drone is inexpensive and unmanned, which makes it extendable, but also it's not some advanced fighter jet, so AA and planes aren't really looking for it.  If and when they do, they'll waste expensive missiles to take down what is, as mentioned before, expendable.\n\nThat's what makes it so dangerous: it doesn't utilize advanced tech, it just fills a niche perfectly.",

Even if Russia ends up occupying Ukraine, they can't possibly control a population fo 45 million people. I have no idea what Putin expects to gain. I simply don't understand what his gameplan is. It's not a small population like Belarus that has less than 10 million people, and an army plus police force willing to back the authoritarian regime. The resistance he can expect following a conquest will be near impossible to supress. There's just no way Ukraine submits.",

When the Bolshevik's seized power in 1917, Ukraine declared her independence, along with Belarus, Armenia, the Baltic states, and others. Ukraine was one of the last territories brought brought under the Bolshevik heel.\n\nFrom 1932 to 1933 the Soviets orchestrated a famine in Ukraine that killed 3.5M citizens. \n\nWhen the nazis arrived, a Ukrainian partisan force arose to defend Ukraine from the nazis and the Bolsheviks, and they kept fighting for an independent Ukraine until the fifties. \n\nIn 1991, Ukraine was one of the first countries to declare its independence from the Soviet Union. \n\nFrom 2004 to 2005 Ukrainians protested an obviously rigged election in which the pro-Western candidate was almost killed and left scarred from dioxine poisoning, and when all was said and done, democracy won.\n\nIn 2013 to 2014, for four fucking months in the winter, Ukrainians protested a government that wanted to turn away from the West and embrace Putin. Some 400 civilians were killed as the government deployed a paramilitary police force and fired live ammunition into the crowd. In the end, a fifth of the country joined the protests or donated materially to support them as they occupied city squares and demanded the government account. And they won, and that pro-Russian pig fled to Russia.\n\nWhen Russia tried to annex half of the country and the Ukrainian army, understaffed and undertrained for decades, collapsed, the people of Ukraine picked up rifles and fought. \n\nUkraine's national anthem literally starts with \"Ukraine is not yet dead\" because after five hundred years of occupation by Imperial Russia and the Bolshevik's trying to destroy Ukraine's culture, and language, and ethnicity, Ukraine is not yet dead.\n\n\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0456! \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430!",

The moon shines in the midst of the sky; the immeasurable vault of heaven seems to have expanded to infinity; the earth is bathed in silver light; the air is warm, voluptuous, and redolent of innumerable sweet scents. Divine night! Magical night! Motionless, but inspired with divine breath, the forests stand, casting enormous shadows and wrapped in complete darkness. Calmly and placidly sleep the lakes surrounded by dark green thickets. The virginal groves of the hawthorns and cherry-trees stretch their roots timidly into the cool water; only now and then their leaves rustle unwillingly when that freebooter, the night-wind, steals up to kiss them. \n\nThe whole landscape is hushed in slumber; but there is a mysterious breath upon the heights. One falls into a weird and unearthly mood, and silvery apparitions rise from the depths. Divine night! Magical night! Suddenly the woods, lakes, and steppes become alive. The nightingales of Ukraine are singing, and it seems as though the moon itself were listening to their song. The village sleeps as though under a magic spell; the cottages shine in the moonlight against the darkness of the woods behind them. The songs grow silent, and all is still. Only here and there is a glimmer of light in some small window. Some families, sitting up late, are finishing their supper at the thresholds of their houses.\u201d Nikolai Gogol, A May Night.",

            "comment": "It's interesting how he has a noticeable Ukrainian accent. Due to the similarity of the languages and most Ukrainians having lots of exposure to Russian their entire lives, it's easy for them to speak like a native, but there are still giveaways that many Ukrainian Russian speakers do and don't realize. This guy is pronouncing the word what as \"sho\" instead of \"shto\", which is Ukrainian-Russian pidgin. Actual Ukrainian pronunciation is \"shcho.\" I also heard \"dumayete\" (think) pronounced the Ukrainian way, Russian would be \"dumayetye.\" Another sign, which I didn't hear in this video, is how Ukrainians tend to pronounce the \"g\" sound. There is a hard G in the Ukrainian alphabet, but it's rarely used. Ukrainians pronounce it like a voiced \"h\". You can hear it in the way he says Gogol, which Russians would pronounce more or less how it's spelled in English. Him saying it the Ukrainian way was likely intentional.",

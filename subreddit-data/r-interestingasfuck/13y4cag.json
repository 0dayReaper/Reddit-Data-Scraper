Sex was viewed very differently in that era than our current views. \n\nFor example, if a man and women were matched together for a prospective marriage, he would meet her and the family then \"sneak\" into her room one night during his visit to see if they were sexually compatible. If one or both weren't feeling it after their night together, they would part ways without hurt feelings and move on with their lives. This is just one example as there was the sight unseen matches and  love matches and whatnot but the example was seen as common and even romantic. \n\nJapan has always had male sex workers, many times dressed as women, even as recent as pre WW2. Same sex interactions weren't always seen as bad and the Ying and yang philosophies could likely back up the idea of same sex relationships as a way to bring a balance of forces into your life. Of course, gay people have always existed but culturally Japan had a complex and varied relationship with same sex interactions, like many long live cultures.",

First of all It's not graphic in the slightest but it for sure normalizes a very casual view on sex, which you can see as good or bad but I'd argue not really a topic for anyone younger than teen year. What it also does though is showing that it's ok to experiment and it doesn't have to mean anything profound, it's just a normal part of self discovery. Now granted not everyone one needs gay sex to find themselves but you're not gay because you had gay sex a couple of times in your teen years, doesn't even mean you need to be bi. Just that you tried it and found that in the end it wasn't something you wanted to keep doing. What labels, be those genders, sexuality, hobby related or personality related are yours to choose and you are allowed to change them, even from a wider label to a more narrow one.\n\nAlso that book series covered a lot of heavy stuff. Trauma bonding, human trafficking, racism, I vaguely recall rape? At least implied? But it was something as rare as a \"cool\" book about a chosen kid with super human powers that dealt a lot with emotions and it helped me immensely, coming from a very emotionally stunted home.",

Another poster said they used metal rings that rubbed against the nails, so maybe that's another explanation. The floors give a little, but not much difference from a regular old wooden floor. The sound in this video is a bit harsh, maybe due to the microphone, but I remember the Nijo Castle floors as like a more sing-song noise, just like birds chirping. It was wild!",

These floors were used in the hallways of some temples and palaces, the most famous example being\u00a0Nij\u014d Castle, in\u00a0Kyoto,\u00a0Japan. Dry boards naturally creak under pressure, but these floors were built in a way that the flooring\u00a0nails\u00a0rub against a jacket or clamp, causing chirping noises. It is unclear if the design was intentional. It seems that, at least initially, the effect arose by chance. **An information sign in Nij\u014d castle states that \"The singing sound is not actually intentional, stemming rather from the movement of nails against clumps in the floor caused by wear and tear over the years\". Legend has it that the squeaking floors were used as a security device, assuring that none could sneak through the corridors undetected.[1]**\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightingale_floor",

Overly tall thresholds is an exame thats definitely intentional and you see it everywhere in old japanese buildings not just a few castles or temples :)",

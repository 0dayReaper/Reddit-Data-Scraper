            "comment": "For those wondering about 'Are you my Mummy?' posts and their relation to the top comment: both are references to an episode of the British Science Fiction series, Doctor Who. This episode featured a scene in which someone's face mutates into a gas mask. It's notable for being absolute *nightmare fuel*.\n\nIt's a great two part episode called The Empty Child and The Doctor Dances. It's from the modern series one (2005). Well worth checking out!",

    "postText": "We have a family of green herons living in our oak tree. We\u2019re in a residential area without water so it is rare to see them, especially nesting. One of the babies fell from the nest. We noticed it in distress and unable to fly up or climb the trunk. We spent an hour setting up various objects as ramps for it to try to get in the tree. The ladder finally did the trick. ",

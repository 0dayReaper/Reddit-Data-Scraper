The story also goes that \"Pepper X\" was just a placeholder until he could make up a good name for it, but as the legend spread of its world-shattering scoville levels, he kept the name.\n\n\nLast year I underwent spicy pepper training after I ordered a trick or treat mystery box from his company, PuckerButt.  I received two mild but delicious hot sauces, and another one called Extra Mean Green.  I slathered the mean green on a burger and quickly realized that I was eating the hottest thing I've ever put in my mouth.  I was getting a massive head rush and a mild panic attack, needing to pace around my house.  I researched the sauce and came to find out that its around 700,000 scoville and one of the peppers he uses in it is Pepper X.\n\n\nAfter that, I was on a mission.  I wanted to eat hot peppers so I can have a chance against the Carolina Reaper.  I got to the point where I could eat five habaneros at a time, but I couldn't find reapers anywhere.  I saw some at an organic foods store, but when it was time for me to eat it, they stopped carrying the reaper.  I've restarted my mission, hoping to find a reaper one day.  I'd try the Pepper X, but it's not commercially available...yet.",

She got one for herself and we sat at her table with glasses of milk.\n\nI bit off about 1/3 of mine and chowed down. Looking back, I think it could have been argued that it was attempted murder.",

I find that extreme heat fascinating though, because capsaicin isn't actually hot.  It acts as a neurotoxin with some receptors in your brain, so while your nerves freak out, it's all in your mind.  You might feel like you're dying, but you're gonna be totally fine.  The only people who should never try really hot peppers are those who are allergic to fruits in the nightshade family.",

The waitress said \u201csir, they are really really hot\u2026\u201d he interrupted her and proudly said \u201cI\u2019m from Texas.\u201d  [I\u2019m pretty sure they doubled the amount of pepper after that comment].  He ate the first wing. You could see the edge of his mouth start to twitch. A dangerous mix of pride and stupidity kicked in. He stopped talking after wing two, but started sweating. Wing three, he calmly gets up with a glass of milk, he had a dumb panicked smile on his face, and walked outside. He then chugged the milk and screamed as he buried his face in a mound of snow. If there is a pepper hotter than that, I\u2019m pretty sure it will melt your esophagus.",

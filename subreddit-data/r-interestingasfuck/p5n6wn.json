Likely to be a stop on the way to a holding area. \n\nMostly, it seems this flight, and others like it, are filled with interpreters and other workers who aided the west, and their families. This is one of the later flights, its possible more women and children got out on earlier flights. But priority is being given to citizens of the west first, then to those who directly worked with each nation, and their families. The list of those is nearly a hundred thousand long. \n\nOman. Qatar. India. Tashkent. \n\nThose seem to be three biggest immediate destinations for aircraft leaving right now. Some flights have gone to turkey. \n\nA lot of the military aircraft of Afghanistan seem to have escaped into Uzbekistan. \n\nLong term:\n\nTurkey\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/p5zpg4/video_turkey_is_building_a_wall_along_its_border/\n\nGermany\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/p5zrmh/germany_just_evacuated_seven_people_from_kabul/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/p6afhh/the_german_air_force_evacuated_125_people_from/\n\nUK\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/News_Feed/comments/p6hvop/uk_takes_in_20000_afghans_refugees_under/\n\nCanada is taking around 25000, UK, Denmark taking around 700, Ireland agreed to take 150, but are discussing taking more.

I've been reading about that genocide for a while now and Vietnams role in ending it is nothing short of pure humanitarianism. Most will play it off as they were starting to have border issues but considering the threat of having the US or Thailand start fighting again it's pretty nuts that they invaded just to stop this insane thing from happening. It's literally on the level of the Allies stopping Germany.\n\nEdit: Since people keep asking I'm going to put a little list together.\n\nVoices of S21\nPol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare\n\nAre both good books to start to get a sense of what happened and why\n\nBut then there is a lot of personal memoires outlining peoples incredible hardships they endured.\n\nThere's also heaps of excellent YouTube documentaries and videos that have come out in the last 15 years outlining it all. \n\nOne of the things that struck me most was so many of the people doing the killing were uneducated teenagers fearing that if they didn't go far enough they too themselves would be killed. And nearing the end of the 4 years they were in power they often did turn on each other to be killed.",

Third degree burns, face was forever unrecognisable after the fact. Her family were home at the time and gave almost immediate assistance, she also didn't live too far away from the hospital. She was very lucky to survive that incident (she is now deceased, later committed suicide).\n\nAfter a significant period of her recovery, I asked her if it was painful when she set herself on fire.\n\nI was shocked that she said no, actually she didn't feel a thing.\n\nBut later, when they did the skin grafts.. that was the worst. The most painful, excruciating thing. Dressing changes too. She said that was the worst pain imaginable. But actually being on fire - nope.\n\nI've heard other people say this before, but I am not sure if it is a universal experience. There is something to be said though for being on fire and burning your nociceptors/other sensory receptors in your skin... there is a logic behind it.\n\nThe other rationale is that when it becomes unproductive to feel pain, your body shuts down the pain response... classic example is the guy who gets his leg mauled by a lion and reports not feeling pain during the attack.\n\nThere was a Serbian woman who survived a plane crash... she reported not remembering anything. She had amnesia from the event. Hopefully these guys falling from the planes didn't suffer.",

There is a big difference if you think that you have 20 days to get everyone out and then suddenly realizing you have 20 hours before the Taliban takes the city.\n\nIt looks like the Taliban seems to have reached a deal with the US so that the Taliban will continue to allow an evacuation to go through and in exchange the US and NATO will not contest the rest of Kabul or try to fight the Taliban as long as the airport remains open. We'll see if this deal holds but hopefully these people can still get out.",

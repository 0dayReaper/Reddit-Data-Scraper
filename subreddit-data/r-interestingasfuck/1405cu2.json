He thought it would be funny to light a cigarette from the fuse of a prop anarchist's bomb. Unfortunately the bomb proved to be real, it blew up and he lost his right thumb, index finger and 30% of his palm which forced him to wear a rubber prosthetic during performances ever since. In addition, he was completely blind for three months and half blind for another three.\n\nHarold Lloyd is the guy lighting his cigarette with a gun in this video.",

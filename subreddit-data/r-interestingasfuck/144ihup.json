So less people had a reason to poach. \n\nAdditionally most alligators don\u2019t make it to that critical size where their survival rates get really high. \n\nBut they mostly survive on the farm. So there is a law that the farmers have to release something like 10% of gators when they hit 3 feet or whatever the magic number is. \n\nIt drastically cuts down on poaching and helps to rebuild populations that were/are victims of poaching. \n\nAll in all gator farming is a good thing. And they\u2019re delicious. It tastes like a mix of pork and fish.",

So less people had a reason to poach. \n\nAdditionally most alligators don\u2019t make it to that critical size where their survival rates get really high. \n\nBut they mostly survive on the farm. So there is a law that the farmers have to release something like 10% of gators when they hit 3 feet or whatever the magic number is. \n\nIt drastically cuts down on poaching and helps to rebuild populations that were/are victims of poaching. \n\nAll in all gator farming is a good thing. And they\u2019re delicious. It tastes like a mix of pork and fish.",

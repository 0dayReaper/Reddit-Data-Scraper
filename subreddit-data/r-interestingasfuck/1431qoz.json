You have to build up a temporary mould out of sand and wood to pour the concrete into, and you would have to do that up to the highest point of your wall for it to be relevant.  Alternatively, you lay huge concrete slabs on the ground to lift them into position, but then you need a crane to put your walls up.\n\nAnd then, even if the walls were concrete, the tornado is ripping off that wooden roof anyway.  And if you want a concrete roof, now we're talking about extreme expense because you need a deeper structure, a larger mould, or a crane.\n\nWithout that city-wealth, people can't afford the expense of a concrete house.  It's much cheaper to make a small structure underground to use in case of emergencies, and even the few grand for the storm cellar is out of a lot of people's budget.",

            "comment": "Reasons why regions in the south. plains, or Midwest don't use concrete or underground shelters (EMPHASIS ON THIS ONE JUST BARE WITH ME):\n\nThe first thing is that it won't be economically viable for most areas to build out of concrete or heavier construction material. It's too damn expensive to rebuild and sadly everyone in these areas can agree regardless of who is in charge. That and the odds of getting hit is miniscule. Even in places where this happens every year.\n\nThe South: Water table too high in some areas, in places like Mississippi the water table is only 3 feet below the ground. The quality of the soil also vastly differs in other states such as Tennessee where some parts of the state are nothing but limestone rock or sedimentary rock within just inches of digging. Alabama (one of the hardest hit state in recent decades) has shelters starting at 5-6k. Terrain here is also crazy, in Mississippi it's mostly flat but half of TN is covered in hills and mountains (and thousands of thousands of creeks same in AL and GA) Also it does not help this region is economically one of the poorest in the US. I should also mention: some areas have corrupt politicians that control where the money goes.\n\nThe Plains: Most of the plains are scarcely populated. You could see for miles and not see a single soul. Tornado shelters are more common out here from recent monsters such as the OKC 99 (regarded as the strongest ever for it's winds) or Moore 2013.  Again, shelters here cost minimum 2k and upwards of 12k.\n\nThe Midwest: People just watch them. They know to shelter because this area practically has no elevation change for dozens to hundreds of miles. People can see a tornado well before it hits them. In fact, of the 3 regions, the Midwest has the most shelters per home.\n\nOh and one more thing: The south is where the most nocturnal events occur. In fact, TN has had nearly 50% of all it's events happen after dark leading the nation followed by KY in 2nd.46-48%",

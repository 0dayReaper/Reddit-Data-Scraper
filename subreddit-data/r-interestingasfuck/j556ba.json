Definitely the sort of experience you don't often get at the more crowded museums.",

We were looking at a Wright Flyer and one of the guys asked if I had questions and I politely declined. I spent some time sharing with my partner when she pointed out the docent was still standing behind us. When he turned he said, \u201cok can you answer some questions for me?\u201d Later he gathered several of the others and they ask me to take them on a tour of their museum. \n\nI am truly just an amateur nerd. Planes have been part of my life from birth having been born on an Air Force base and my dad having worked in Boeing flight test. So to have the old air guys, pilots and such decide I was worth listening to was an honor.",

People like you learn those things because you love the subject, and find it cool and interesting. Makes it easier for knowledge to stick. People who talk about it professionally will have a lot of knowledge down pat, but it's often limited to the stuff they actually need to regularly talk about. \n\n(Of course, there are also the amateur-nerds-turned-docents who are in a league of their own, since they have the drive to learn and *also* get to spend a ton of time on it. I don't really have a good sense of what fraction of the people you see in museums fall into that category, though.)",

There are a lot of planes in that building which you have to be quite into planes to know why they are there. Yes there are war planes with the Enola Gay being a huge deal but there are a great many technology drivers, record setters, and race planes. It is a bit more of a nerdy collection with a Space Shuttle  and some war planes. It is a huge number of planes too.",

The science, engineering, the design, the courage of anyone flying in it, the melancholic feeling of looking at it in a museum, the personal link of being an 80s kid and what the Shuttle program meant at the time. It might sound a bit dumb, but most of all it's just hard to imagine that it had been to space and through re-entry many times. Going to the Air and Space museums in DC is chock-full of many of the milestones of flight, to a point where it's almost overwhelming, but this is the one that remains the most awe inspiring to me.",

                            "comment": "Did somebody say blackbird....\n\nThere were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.",

First helicopter, a navigation kid on the boat called a southeast wind a *north*east wind, so the pilots flew the wrong direction and had to ditch his helicopter in the ocean and get picked up. My dad was soooo mad somebody fucked up and destroyed his baby. CO of the ship never got a promotion because of it.",

Then you use it to kill another human and there would be a major bond. Like a bomber it has a multi person crew who would experience it together. \n\nThey are also a mind boggling amount of work very much like a plane. They are easily above two hours maintenance per hour of operation even in training. Crews who don\u2019t care much don\u2019t do good work and the tank always wins that game. It will do something like strand you with a broken track which causes more physical work than most people will have ever done before it moves again especially if you drove off it in the process.",

But today Military pilots fly a bunch of different tails (referring to the tail number of the jet which is like its registration) depending on what's ready to fly or what's down for maintenance. \n\nMy assumption is it could be possible he flew that tail number before. Or maybe they actually did assign individual aircraft to individual pilots in WW2, but I kinda doubt that as it decreases pilot readiness, availability and mission capability.\n\nAll that being said, some tails may have a pilot's name on the side, along with the crew chief's name. But that pilot may take a different jet that day, just like a crew chief doesn't strictly fix the jet with their name on it.\n\nSee also, the lyrics for the song \"I'm a Pilot\" by Dos Gringos. \ud83d\ude02\n\n&gt;And I'm sorry I scratched your jet up\n&gt;Well maybe she had an itch\n&gt;Cause your baby may have your name on her\n&gt;But I just made her my bitch",

If they survived 25 missions often they flew the bomber home because it was ready for a refit or to be used for training. Combat was HARD on them and most aircraft as well as crews didn\u2019t come close to making 25.",

Chuck Yeager shot one down whilst it tried to land. \n * See also the infamous RAND \"clubbing baby seals\" report, which showed that the USA couldn't defend Taiwan despite the remarkable performance of the F-22 and F-35 because the Chinese would just shoot down all the tankers, killing the stealth fighters by fuel exhaustion.\n\nI think the Corsair was a good aeroplane, but I also think that wars are won by logistics.",

The US would be having to operate from remote bases like Guam and Okinawa, along with carrier forces.\n\nChina has interdiction routes to hit flights in and around Okinawa, especially vulnerable C4I and tanker aircraft that would be controlling and supporting the battle.\n\nGuam would be a saturated base, as it is mostly used for tanks and bombers.\n\nThis leaves the carrier aircraft and the navy on its own minus the long range bomber aircraft that can tank outside the range of Chinese aircraft, but would have to fly in with no escorts (and there is a good chance that China now has the capability of at least detecting B-2 raids in progress, even if not directly knowing their exact position).\n\nA war with China would be an absolute nightmare for the US, even if nuclear weapons are not considered.",

I met him once, he had several pieces of anti aircraft shrapnel he took from his butt pack parachute. Corsair pilots sat on their chutes in flight. The shrapnel from a close aboard burst of an anti aircraft shell pierced the belly of his plane with multiple fragments, several of which wound up in his Butt Chute. That chute saved his life.\n\nHe also had a SW model 10 .38 revolver he wore in a shoulder holster, bequeathed to his Son. It had 'notches' (plural) carved into the wooden grip. \n\nHe didn't like talking about it much but I was informed by his Son that one of the times (one?) he got shot down he crash landed in the Sea and stayed with his plane before it sank. A Japanese patrol boat got to him first and he dispatched several Japanese soldiers as they tried to capture him. He was later rescued from the water by a 'Flying Boat' in his Mae West life Preserver.\n\nAfter that incident he got a Colt Super .38 Automatic Pistol and carried that aloft with him instead because, he said, the SW .38 Revolver 'didn't have enough stopping power'.\n\nHe also bequeathed the Super .38 to his Son. \n\nI got to fire both on a camping trip. It was an Honor. The Super is basically a hot loaded 9mm, expelling large white sheet of flame out the barrel, hi velocity, devastating and loud.",

He was so surprised that you could just... buy a print of that plane. He was like, \"That's it! That is exactly what it looked like!\" I can't imagine how he would respond to seeing one again in person!\n\nIt blows my mind that these old cats from WWII are still out here living their best lives at damn near 100-years-old.

The video then goes into the manufacturing of a pocketed coil mattress and then follows the build out of that one. The foam cores are built out much the same with only a few differences. Even flattened, vacuumed, and rolled at the bagging machine before ship. There are no springs in the foam core. Just added layers of latex or foam of different densities. Sometimes glued. Other times not. Typically, the mattress is taped up (sewing the border to panel/grey back is referred to as taping) tight enough to prevent any movement of the additional foam layers. And foam/visco(memory foam) doesn\u2019t move across foam easily due to friction.",

I think the mattress will last a couple of years less than if we went Dunlop, but the longevity was worth the comfort for me and my wife. Longevity wise, I was told I would need to replace it 1-3 years earlier than if I went Dunlop, but it is still a 15+ year mattress. I figure we'll have our money's worth by then.\n\nI know 2 years isn't a lot for a mattress, but we also bought an adjustable frame and use it daily, and haven't had any degradation in the mattresses in the flexing areas or the edges. They still feel just like it did when we first got them. We bought twin XL for a split king, and I was worried about the middle where the crack is. We cuddle and compress that area frequently and it is holding up splendidly.",

Long story, but 14 years ago when I was a kid my dad bought a couple old Cadillacs off of a man from Ohio. He had 8 of those classics in a garage, a bunch of other vehicles and a decent mansion. Apparently had a bunch of antique firearms too. Super nice man, his kid was a piece of work the only reason he sold the cars to us was his kid asked if they would be his when the dad died. I guess the kid is bitter because after he turned 18 and left the house his dad working in a whirlpool factory (company, not an actual pool lol) came up with an ingenious way to cut the production line IN HALF for their washers and dryers. He was smart though and protected his idea, and when presented the company gave him more money than he knew what to do with. Somehow he got to know a bunch of other assembly line \u201cinventors\u201d who have also figured out cool ways to be more efficient",

Many of the innovations on our production lines were originated by blue collar technicians who ran the lines.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not aware of them being paid handsomely for their innovations. Work at a large company, and I\u2019m not sure through which official avenues they could be paid out for it.",

And take em to bits and reassemble them with various scraps of better fabric and foam and whatever and tons of new car smell type sprays. It's a weird cottage industry a certain sub class really roll their sleeves up and get into. Really weird to think but they are weirdly good at it, sometimes they get limited batches into shop stock and they have been sold as new when they are anything but new \ud83d\ude31",

One job I had required me to send out foam mattress toppers in the mail, all it took was a quality bin bag and a Henry Hoover, a double sized one was folded in half and rolled tight and it just fit in the large bin bag, then I stuffed it down some more so I could close the bag round the hoover hose and I began to remove the air, pretty soon it's much smaller, you just kinda work it down to the smallest it will go and tape it up good, slap a label on it and drop kick the football sized dense thing into the collect bin. \n\nI always thought it needed some kind of warning on it \ud83e\udee3 cos once you try to open it, it's going to get bigger real quick. The boss said 'they ordered it, they know what it is' but i was thinking about how many people just started ripping into a random parcel, maybe in the car after expecting to pick up a mattress and wondering if the order got mixed up, meh, long time ago now, think that was my first real job.",

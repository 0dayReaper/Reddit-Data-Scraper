It\u2019s working!\u201d  The problem is they just made some shit and tested it once and it shook a massive bridge that they could feel 100 feet away. If they would have actually built it to scale or put the time in required to understand everything it would obviously get better. They even say as much.  Like imagine a TV show crafting up this shit and it halfway working. What you think the government could do with the same ideas and a bottomless $ flow? \n\nPoint is his theory works in some Capacity the way he said it would. That\u2019s how mythbusters got any idea of what to do. It\u2019s one of those things like I said above he had the right idea just not the resources or the application. \n\nI\u2019m sure the government has tested all this it\u2019s known and they try everything. So maybe they have a device or maybe they don\u2019t. We won\u2019t know either way so the best we can get is a shit build on TV that halfass works. \n\nThe harmonic vibrations and matching the frequency does seem to produce some effect though and it can move things, big things. To what scale, fuck if I\u2019d know.",

Are you clamping 75 clocks and radios to a bridge? How did you come to the conclusion it\u2019s completely impossible when even the people who built a shit one claim to have had it working shaking a bridge and feeling the effects at 100 feet. You understand the energy it takes to move a bridge back and forth for you to feel the shaking 100 ft away? That was from one try with a trash machine. Kinda different when it\u2019s an episode on a TV show between let\u2019s say a genius inventors passion project. I can imagine who researched and studied more. \n\nAccording to the recently declassified documents, some in the FBI feared Kosanovic was trying to wrest control of Tesla's technology in order to \u201cmake such information available to the enemy,\u201d and even considered arresting him to prevent this.\n\n^^^\n\nSo yeah probably nothing there but a normal day. They surely took his files for no reason for no hidden technology. Got it. \n\nAccording to Foxworth, the government was \"vitally interested\" in preserving Tesla's papers. Two days after Tesla's death, representatives of the Office of Alien Property went to his room at the New Yorker Hotel and seized all his possessions.\n\n\nAnyway enough of this, but have a good one.",

Einstein was lauded in his time and I have no doubt that his fame contributed to his further success due to funding and collaboration. Tesla had no great fame, funding, or collaboration in his life (at least not at the same scale) so imagine what he could've contributed to the world if he /did/ have those things.",

I think he deserves a lot of praise though for what he put out knowledge wise in his life. I know it\u2019ll be better than I accomplish lol. \n\nAs for the current wars, no Tesla didn\u2019t invent A/C current if that\u2019s the question. He was just the main player against Edison\u2019s D/C which was, well not good. He had lots of cool other stuff he came up with though besides the Tesla coil and and the A/C war and blah blah. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is like let\u2019s say a Da Vinci\u2019s helicopter idea. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%27s_aerial_screw\n\nIs this a helicopter? Eh lol. Like it\u2019s right on the idea but a bit too early for his time. Tesla has a lot of these \u201cyou had the spirit\u201d  kinda deals but that\u2019s just life. You live in your time and die and the future pieces the puzzle together. In my opinion just starting the dialogue has to count for something. Very rarely do things just appear it\u2019s usually an upgrade of an upgrade of an upgrade. So I just appreciate all the info he put out right or wrong cause he put out a lot and sometimes people have to walk for you to run.",

That's fair to note",

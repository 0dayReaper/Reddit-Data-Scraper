If one of them is clogged or dirty, it will deliver less fluid (which would make that cylinder run lean in an engine).\n\nI\u2019m unsure if what we are seeing here is a test / calibration cycle or a cleaning cycle.",

If it doesn't atomise the fuel properly, you can end up with unburnt fuel in the mixture as the droplets are too large to burn fully during combustion. This can be changed by adjusting the spring rate of the valve.\n\nThe spray pattern is difficult to quantify, so having a visible check (like with the glowing tubes), you can see the spray pattern and the dispersal rate.\n\nI created a similar experiment at Uni, only I had a hand pump and one injector. By changing the spring rate, you can change the way the fuel comes out of the nozzle, I used a combination of high-speed video and some paper towels to capture my results.",

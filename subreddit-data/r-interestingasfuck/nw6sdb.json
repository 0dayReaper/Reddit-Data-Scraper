Such as: the variety does not last well in storage; bruises too easily during shipping; the apples are huge and most consumers want a smaller apple or vice versa, too small; tree production is lower than other varieties; the variety has a tendency toward alternate bearing ie. barely produces any fruit every other year, etc.\n\nI have never seen my favorite apple for sale at a grocery store, Hudson\u2019s Golden Gem. The only way some of these obscure, but delicious apple varieties continue to exists is through backyard gardeners and small orchardists.",

The anti-fat thing was already discovered to be completely wrong like 20 years ago, everyone has moved on from it already.\n  \nEspecially since most low-fat foods are super high in sugar, which is something the human body doesn't actually need to live (unlike fat). You can live your entire life without eating sugar, and love to a ripe old age. Your body basically produces sugar for you, by converting carbs (and about 50% of protein) that you eat. You don't need to add extra sugar on top of that\n    \nFat is healthy. It is very good for you, and is necessary to keep living. There's a reason there's a thing called [\"rabbit starvation\" which is a type of malnutrition](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning). Where if all you eat is rabbit, you'll die eventually, because rabbit meat has basically no fat in it, so however many calories you consume from the rabbit you're eating, you'll eventually drop dead, because the human body needs fat. You can be obese, and yet malnourished. There's a difference between malnutrition and undernutrition. Undernutrtion means you're not getting enough calories and are wasting away. Malnutrition means you're not getting the necessary vitamins and minerals etc in your diet, including fat. Fat is one of those necessary things along with vitmsins and minerals. \n  \nAnd fat is necessary for a strong immune system, for healthy brain function, and is very good at filling you up so that you actually end up consuming fewer calories over the course of the day compared to a low-fat diet, cos you are so stuffed you don't end up getting snacks in between meals",

The winner of the survival contest Jordan Jonas was concerned about starvation because he was living off of moose meat. He killed and butchered it down, then wolverines got to his food and stole the moose fat. Consequently he only had protein to live off of and was afraid of starving.\n\nEdit: updated to not be as alarmist",

If we naturally grew apples there would be a huge amount of variance in the product.\n\nThey basically just swap out the trunk early on for a branch from a tree they like to ensure the same \"type\" of apples. If you grow from seed I think it can vary quite a bit.\n\nYou can also  put multiple varieties of apples on one tree.[https://www.homedepot.ca/product/vigoro-pommier-combo-espalier-/1000775235](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/vigoro-pommier-combo-espalier-/1000775235)  \n\n\nedit: As a kid, I had a random fucking apple tree in my yard. It produced a ton of apples every year that looked somewhat like store bought ones, but generally inedible outside ofl ike a pie+ton of sugar scenario. So many fucking wasps though, that tree brought way more wasps than joy.",

They cut off all the branches and graft on a more popular varieties",

Their genetic variation results in a great degree of difference among the offspring.\n\nThe only way to ensure an apple tree is the same as its parent is to clone it, which is generally done by splicing a branch onto a different trunk.\n\nThe trunk roughly determines the size and shape of the tree, and the branch itself determines the type of apple.",

Exclusively tulips.  (Technically bulbs could be traded through their stock market, but that stock market was quite tiny and the amount of money in tulips would have so completely dwarfed all other stocks combined, it's not all that relevant to the story) The tulip mania was so insane some varieties of bulbs traded for absolutely absurd amounts of money, like as much as a house or a car would today.  Farmers started growing pretty much exclusively tulips because that's where the money was.  Inevitably, the tulip market collapsed though, as bubbles do.\n\n**Basically, tulips didn't crash the \"stock market\", they crashed the *entire Dutch economy*. Whatever stock market that existed in the 1600s in the Netherlands wasn't integral to the economy though.**",

They're literally my favorite type of apple.\n\nAnd before you say I have bad taste or that I just haven't eaten the right apples, hear me out!  I've tried many more apple cultivars than most people have since I'm really into cider and I've been to a bunch of orchards/cideries.  Many of them are amazing.  Many of them are crispier, juicier, tangier, more sour, etc. than Red Delicious.  However, Red Delicious are still my favorite.\n\nMy theory is that there's a flavor compound in Red Delicious that I can taste that most other people can't.  It wouldn't be unprecedented - we all taste foods in different ways due to how strongly we detect the various flavor compounds they contain, for example some people can't even eat cilantro because one of the compounds that others can't taste is so overwhelming to them.  The reason I believe this is because Red Delicious apples have a flavor in them that I haven't found in any other apple.  It's so hard to describe, but it's incredibly unique and I absolutely love it.  When people describe them as bland or flavorless it blows my mind, because they have such a distinctive and unique flavor for me.\n\nIs there anyone else like me?",

In that year, Farmer and Settler published the account of a local historian who had interviewed two men who had known Smith. One of those interviewed recalled that, in 1868, he (then twelve years old) and his father had been invited to Smith's farm to inspect a chance seedling that had sprung near a creek. Smith had dumped there, among the ferns, the remains of French crab-apples that had been grown in Tasmania.[7] Another story recounted that Smith had been testing French crab-apples for cooking, and, throwing the apple cores out her window as she worked, had found that the new cultivar had sprung up underneath her kitchen windowsill. Whatever the case, Smith took it upon herself to propagate the new cultivar on her property, finding the apples good for cooking and for general consumption.[8] Having \"all the appearances of a cooking apple,\" they were not tart but instead were \"sweet and crisp to eat.\"[5] She took a stall at Sydney's George Street market, where the apples stored \"exceptionally well and became popular\" and \"once a week sold her produce there.\"",

The \"delicious\" title was truly earned.\n\nBuuuuut, the Hawkeye was a splotchy yellow and red, and the color was deemed unappealing. So in a fit of corporate aesthetics and ignorance, Stark selectively bred for bright red fruit, which had the unintended consequence of ruining the taste.\n\nAnd so the most delicious apple in history was fumbled by capitalism.",

Those things can taste very different as well. I bought a rare variety tree for my yard and it provided large mangoes that turned from green to yellow (never blushed), had no fibers, ripened about a month after all typical varieties ripened, and was delicious, *and I never wrote down the name of the variety* so I couldn\u2019t even get another one if I was wanted to.",

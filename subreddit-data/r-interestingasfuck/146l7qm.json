But in the end the taxpayers will end up having to pay the insurance premiums. Maybe there\u2019s a way to make up the system so it doesn\u2019t involve tax payer money like that but a system of accountability has to be the way forward\n\nJust not entirely sure how to have it that would make sense as a system",

The risks would be way too high - the only way they\u2019d do it is if it was backed by public money which just puts us back as square 1.\n\n\nThe premiums would be astronomically high, I\u2019d imagine significantly higher than medical malpractice and those premiums are $10k+ a year, depending on area of practice.   Cops can\u2019t afford $1k/month for insurance. \n\nI like the concept of it but I just don\u2019t see it working here",

In the end taxpayers would be responsible\n\nBut the only way some of these people react is because of money. They see one cop costs 3x more expensive to employ than another cop while having a history as well they would avoid them.\n\nJust in the end we are footing the bill. Not sure how to set up a system like that but something that holds cops accountable for their mistakes making it harder to employ them sounds like the move. Just can\u2019t figure out how you\u2019d do it without implications on tax payers\n\nAnd you\u2019re right no insurance company would get involved unless the premiums were already insanely high as they would want to make money too. So that\u2019s even more needless spending into another garbage type of corporate system.",

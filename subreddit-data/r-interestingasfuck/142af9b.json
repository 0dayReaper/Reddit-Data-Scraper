But one of their earlier attempts failed and they folded it into 4 dimensions or something and strange 3 dimensional objects appeared in their sky, one of them being a giant eye, possibly a higher dimensional being they caught the attention of.\n\nAlso in the China Mieville book \"Iron Council\" an enemy nation used some sort of magic to create a giant eyeball looking down on their main city to terrify the citizens.  Which did sound pretty terrifying lol.  It's what the drones in this video made me think of.",

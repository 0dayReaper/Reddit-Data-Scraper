You can grow them in pots indoors, if you have lots of light then it can work great but if not I wouldn't bother - one year I lived in a very sunny apartment and had tomatoes in pots all summer, had to move them to bigger pots regularly as they outgrew the original space. Then I had a less sunny window and got very few tomatoes so it wasn't as worth it (although I still love the plants and the smell, but you end up with loads of dead plants in winter so... Worth trying and satisfying to grow your own but don't count on a lot of tomatoes!)",

We have a large garden with heaps of planting space but still do half the tomatoes in pots.\n\nIf you're a beginner it's good to start with bush tomatoes as they don't need a steak to be supported by nor pinching out growing tips. But to be honest this other, cordon tomatoes, don't need much more than that - a sturdy pole to support them and frequent pinching.\n\nStart with any variety you like, there's so many tomatoes!\n\nIt's quite droll, [but here is a good guide](https://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/grow-plants/how-to-grow-tomatoes/) from the BBC about how to grow tomatoes for the first time. Keep in mind the planting times are based on the UK climate. If you live somewhere warmer... Even better for you! \n\nThe main thing is they love the sunshine. Really love it. And consistency of watering. I keep mine wet almost all summer, twice day becuase they end up with weird shapes other wise! \n\nOnce a plant it fully growing you'll need a pot about 20cm in diameter for each big plant.\n\nYou can definitely do this in your apartment, they don't take up much space at all! They're good to grow with basil and basil loves the same conditions and has low maintenance. Basil grows really fast!",

Much of the produce sold in big supermarkets is harvested early to survive shipping and lacks it's full nutritional value anyways. So the seeds may be immature or the produce may also have been irradiated during shipping if it's an imported good. \n\nThere's a lot of possible reasons \"seeds straight from the fruit\" may not be sprouting other than your methods if the fruit came from a box store. \n\nIt's really hard to say without getting more into specific plants.",

The craziest thing, aside from the armoured guards standing around it while it was on display, was how quiet it was when it did the fly by. It sounded like a slightly loud car driving by.\n\nIf you were a mile away you would definitely not hear it flying.",

Your hands and feet are probably stumps, you're dragging yourself around on them, no one can tell if you're a man or a woman, if they're looking at you from the front or the back, you're bleeding everywhere, you've got glass sticking out of your body and you're in unimaginable pain, desperate for water and you know you're going to die, but for the moment *you're alive*.\n\nThe Japanese called them ant-walking alligators. Warning: It's horrifying.\n\n*He describes the so-called \u201cant-walking alligators\u201d that the survivors saw everywhere, men and women who \u201cwere now eyeless and faceless \u0097 with their heads transformed into blackened alligator hides displaying red holes, indicating mouths.\u201d*\n\n*The author continues: \u201cThe alligator people did not scream. Their mouths could not form the sounds. The noise they made was worse than screaming. They uttered a continuous murmur \u0097 like locusts on a midsummer night. One man, staggering on charred stumps of legs, was carrying a dead baby upside down.\u201d*\n\n*A grocer:\u00a0\u201cThe appearance of people was\u2026 well, they all had skin blackened by burns\u2026 They had no hair because their hair was burned, and at a glance you couldn\u2019t tell whether you were looking at them from in front or in back\u2026 Many of them died along the road\u2014I can still picture them in my mind\u2014like walking ghosts\u2026 They didn\u2019t look like people of this world.\u201d*\n\n*A fourteen-year-old boy: \u201cNight came and I could hear many voices crying and groaning with pain and begging for water. Someone cried, \u2018Damn it! War tortures so many people who are innocent!\u2019 Another said, \u2018I hurt! Give me water!\u2019 This person was so burned that we couldn\u2019t tell if it was a man or a woman. The sky was red with flames. It was burning as if scorching heaven.\u201d*\n\n\nAlso an interesting note: wearing white helps protect you a bit. \n\n*One doctor, Mr. Pellegrino writes, \u201creported numerous instances of women and children wearing patterned clothing, sometimes displaying flowers on white cloth. The dark flowers were now branded permanently onto their skin.\u201d*\n\nThe flesh covered in white did not burn while the flesh covered under a colored pattern did. \n\nSources:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/books/20garner.html \n\nhttps://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/history/bombings-hiroshima-and-nagasaki-1945/\n\nTL;DR: If I get nuked please God atomize me instantly.",

We lived in southern California and they worked at Northrop. They were brought on from the very beginning and as soon as the media found out about these new highly futuristic aircraft that were being built everyone wanted to know what it would look like. Northrop built a huge fence around the property to keep the project confidential. During that time all sorts of art was being released from sceptics on what the plane would look like. After everyone finally got to see what the B-2 looked like they realized that if you were above Northrop and had a birds eye view over that fence you would have seen that they built the fence in the exact shape of a B-2 bomber. Nobody every imagined that this bizarre looking fence was the design.",

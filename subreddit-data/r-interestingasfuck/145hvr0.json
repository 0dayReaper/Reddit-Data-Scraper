            "comment": "Here is link to full article below, including source. \n\nhttps://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/the-lion-of-lucerne--the-controversial-tourist-attraction/46819790\n\nThe Lion of Lucerne is situated just outside the old city, up on a hill. The massive sandstone monument of a lion impaled with a spear is about 10 metres long and 6 metres wide and stands behind a pool of water. The proud animal is in its death throes, a front paw resting on a shield adorned with the fleur-de-lys of the French monarchy next to another shield bearing the Swiss cross.\n\nHistorical event\n\nBesides these symbols, the monument also bears inscriptions: a dedication in Latin Helvetiorum Fidei ac Virtuti (to the loyalty and bravery of the Swiss); dates, also in Latin; a list of 26 names; and two Roman numerals, DCCLX (760) and CCCL (350).\n\nThe monument commemorates a key episode in the French Revolution: the capture of the Tuileries Palace by armed insurgents on August 10, 1792. This important event marked a turning point in the Revolution, with the fall of the monarchy and the beginning of the Reign of Terror, followed by the September massacres.\n\nFrom the Swiss point of view, this day is associated with the sacrifice of the Swiss Guards who were defending the palace. The names inscribed on the monument are those of officers who died on that day, and the numbers 760 and 350 refer to the number of guards who were killed and who survived, respectively.\n\nInitial controversy\n\nThis monument was erected at the request of the Lucerne native Karl Pfyffer von Altishofen, an officer who was back in Lucerne on leave on that fateful day. In 1819, a quarter of a century after the events, he published a book about his comrades entitled An account of the bearing of the regiment of Swiss Guards on August 10 1792. The powerful response to the book motivated him to organise a public subscription in conservative Catholic circles to pay for the erection of a commemorative monument in Lucerne.\n\n\u201cPfyffer\u2019s book is more hagiography than objective history\u201d, argues Alain-Jacques Tornare, a historian who specialises in the French Revolution and Franco-Swiss relations. \u201cThe story was manipulated to fit the image of a Swiss Guard massacred by a pitiless band of revolutionaries.\u201d\n\nThe number of victims, in particular, is doubtful. The count of 26 officers killed may be accurate, but the losses in the ranks are clearly exaggerated. Recent historical studies estimate that 300 guards were killed, not 760 as claimed in the inscription on the monument. \u201cThe higher number of survivors, and the fact that there were about the same number of guards killed as revolutionaries, certainly relativises the idea of there having been a \u2018massacre\u2019 of the Swiss Guard\u201d, Tornare points out.\n\nApart from the numbers, it was the image of Switzerland conveyed by the Lion that stirred up controversy. The monument seemed to glorify a conservative, counter-revolutionary Switzerland, and this was seen as a deliberate provocation by liberals at the time, some of whom actually tried to disrupt the inauguration and later damage the monument itself. \u201cThis was the reaction of a protestant, liberal Switzerland, which preferred internal economic development to military emigration to other countries\u201d, explains Tornare. Furthermore, \u201cliberals saw in this monument a reminder of close ties with a foreign power, when they were trying to create an independent Switzerland.\u201d",

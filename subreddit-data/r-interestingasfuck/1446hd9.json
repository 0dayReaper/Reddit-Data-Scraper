Lots of things wind up being behind glass or a layer of epoxy, or out of reach.   Maybe because it's a consortium of artists instead of engineers?  I don't know, but I've noticed that as well and our family talked about it.",

You can make an entire day of the place!\n\nMy family went once on a trip and we rearranged our entire trip to go the next day as well. Good thing too, we missed the entire cave side. We've been back several times since and it's just as fun every time. \n\nI highly recommend going if you're anywhere close. Wear slippery pants for better speed on the slides!",

Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: It's called the City Museum, I think because the materials they use to construct everything came from defunct and decommissioned parts of the city throughout history, like bridges and fences and facade molding from famous buildings, stuff like that. There's one wall built from like 500 bread pans from an old commercial kitchen.",

For example they have the worlds largest #2 pencil inside the indoor skate park, they used to have the worlds largest pair of underwear but someone stole them - washed them - then returned them- and then got stolen again XD. There\u2019s a suspended boulder near the entrance \ud83d\udc40, a several story slide, a whole ass cave system to explore, tons of artwork that\u2019s been donated/ donated stuff turned into artwork\u2026 man I could go on for a while. \n\nFYI to anyone considering visiting, BUY THE KNEEPADS. Your knees will thank me later.\n\nEdit: Another neat fact, in picture 6 you can see the triangular slide, those painted rods were actually used in the old factory that this building used to house. They are all individually painted by people and they\u2019re all over the place. They spin too!",

Its worth it.\n\nAnd if you're a family, especially a lower income family, looking for a cheaper vacation, STL aint a bad pick. If you can afford the travel from wherever you're from, theres lots of free and low cost things to do there with kids. STL zoo is one of the best zoos in the country and admission is free. The Science Center is also a free fun activity (though with the SC there are rotating special paid exhibits, but general admission is free). I'd also recommend the botanical gardens, the magic house, the butterfly house, the art museum, and of course the Arch lol. Lots of fun things to do in St. Louie, and its not a vacation destination people generally think about so you won't have Disney World crowds.",

But I\u2019m okay with that. There are much worse things my taxes could go to. \n\nAnd of course things like parking is not included, nor are the special attractions such as iMax shows, train rides, or special traveling  art or history exhibits. Those all have special admission prices. But even without the extras, there\u2019s still plenty to do and see. And parking can often be found for free if you don\u2019t park in the special lots and look for street parking.",

I don\u2019t know if it would be worth flying in from the coast, but if you live within a 6 hour drive it\u2019s totally worth visiting the city. \n\nGo to a Cardinal Game. Our stadium has great views of the arch from home plate, and even the nosebleed seats have a great view of the action on the field. There\u2019s not a bad seat in the house. \n\nWe have MLS Soccer now, and the stadium is close to the aforementioned City Museum. Tickets are kinda pricey, but the stadium is new, nice, and the team is on fire right now. \n\nThe Zoo, Art Museum, history museum, and science center are all free to get in to (tax payer supported through our property taxes). While you admittedly have better examples of each in other cities, they are all nice and especially nicer since they\u2019re free. \n\nThe Missouri Botanical Gardens is wonderful, and right now it\u2019s filled with glass art from Dale Chihuly nestled amongst the plants. Totally worth checking out if you\u2019re in town. \n\nhttps://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org\n\nThe Fabulous Fox has Broadway musicals and the interior of the theater is just a chaotic baroque explosion of crimson and gold. \n\nhttps://www.fabulousfox.com\n\n\nThe Foundry Food Hall is centrally located in Midtown and has every type of cuisine you could want all under one roof. \n\nhttps://www.cityfoundrystl.com\n\n\nUrban Chestnut Bierhall or Biergarten is just fine example of all the wonderful breweries in the city. The Bierhall is in the grove and it\u2019s a loud chaotic mess with a gigantic list of taps and delicious german food with long communal tables. \n\nhttps://www.urbanchestnut.com\n\nLaumeier Sculpture Park is another free park with a lot of outdoor sculptures and art installations. I wouldn\u2019t travel just to see it, but if you\u2019re here is a wonderful place to burn and hour or two and stretch your legs. \n\nhttps://www.laumeiersculpturepark.org\n\nThe arch and the arch grounds themselves are a sight. \n\nIn the 90s a lot of Bosnian refugees moved to St Louis, about 70k at its peak. While a lot have moved out to the county they still left their mark on the city and we have a lot of good Bosnian food options here. A good place to try is Balkan Treat Box for some very delicious and unique Bosnian Fusion Cuisine. \n\nYou like chess? We got the Chess hall of fame here. Please check it out and let Missouri billionaire Rex Sinquefield spend his money making St Louis a global chess destination rather than spending his money making his libertarian plot to ruin our public schools a reality. \n\nCahokia Mounds are right across the River in Illinois. It was once the site of a massive Native American city of about 40k that just\u2026 disappeared around 1350. Of you are a history nerd it\u2019s a neat place to visit. \n\nSix Flags has a theme park and a water park outside of the city. Its kind of a drive though. It\u2019s nothing special compared to other regional theme parks, but it\u2019s one more attraction in the area.",

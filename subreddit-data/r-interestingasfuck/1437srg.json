They're gradually shifting to a new business model, where posts take up your whole screen because a whole-screen ad (ie promoted post) makes the platform a lot more money than banner ads ever could. Thing is, user generated content is the reason to visit Reddit, so the more ads they water that down with the less likely users are to come consume content, or to generate more content for them. So rather than foster this great thing they created which they made a little money on, they're choosing to move towards this less-great thing so that they can show more profits to the investors or whatever. \n\nSame reason everything is going to shit in the world, unfettered greed. People who have way more than they could ever need or even use in a lifetime, and only want more.",

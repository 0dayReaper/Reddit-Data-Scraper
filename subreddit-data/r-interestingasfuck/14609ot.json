Worked like a charm. I didn't suck out the mud like they did but just pushed the cable down though the mud slurry. Then I just pushed the edges back together and when it all dried the depression was only about 3 in deep. A couple of good rains and the trench will pretty much disappear. Way easier than digging a trench.",

None of the muslim countries recognized what is believed to be a muslim population genocide, with zero to no evidence too.  \n\nOne party system is what makes them efficient, since there are no delays in acting on the policies they make. It is in fact one of the biggest factors of their growth. Let me remind you that that party numbers more than 100m members, so if it doesn't represent the will of China's people, I really don't know what does.",

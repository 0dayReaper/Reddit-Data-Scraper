They're working to redevelop it into a hybrid destination, with hotels, apartments, restaurants, and a few other things.\n\nI really have to wonder what the rest of it looks like inside.  Must have been fun to explore, but getting up there without a working elevator had to suck ass lol",

Tire bunkers, old cars,  legit tree forts, like a super fucking awesome setup not to mention it was in like the foothills so it had lots of elevation change. We played there for 2 summers then some asshole decided to DESTROY 2 working vehicles of the property owner. A 90' Caviler and a 1500 Silverado. I mean smashed windows jumped on the hoods and the roof, trunk. We never got to step foot in those woods again. We tried a few other places but nothing was anywhere near as good. People always have to ruin shit.",

It was jackass rich and rebellious high schoolers who would plausibly take a shit in an unlocked car that I was worried about.\n\nMost high school kids do dumbass things here and there, but they're still mostly good kids.

Just meant to say that pretty much any habitable building in a high population density area will eventually be squatted unless aggressively and actively defended.",

Driving through town, there are streets where houses appear condemned and in severe disrepair but clearly are occupied, 1-2 blocks over there is a brand new house with a giant fence and security system. \n\nThe fact that there are skyscrapers which are sitting abandoned is unfortunately not surprising. If there is economic recovery, I really hope that they find a way to support the people already living there instead of displacing them.",

There used to be a single patrolman from Imperial Security that drove around lazily, and that was the only security that the place had. Most of the first floor doors and windows were boarded up, but you could shoulder through the wood blocking an entrance on the north side, knock the wood out of the way, and set it back up so that it looked as if the wood had never moved. \n\nI went through with a flashlight, and took some pictures on an old camera of mine. The various stairwells were in terrible shape, with sections of the staircases missing. There were also holes in several floors, some leading to several-story drops. Walls were crumbling, paint was peeling , and the place looked like it could collapse at any moment, honestly. There were various cots, needles, bottles and other pieces of refuse in various places throughout the building, and I heard footsteps on more than one occasion during my 4 hours inside. \n\nThe revolving restaurant on top is in amazingly good shape, though. There was even a pool table with several cues and all of the balls, unbroken glasses behind the bar, and old bottles, plates, tables, newspapers, and all manner of other neat shit. I guess 37 floors was too high for the vagrants to climb and fuck with it - which would make sense, as I stopped seeing evidence of squatters once I got up around the twentieth floor or so. Shame because it\u2019s the best view in Memphis, by far. \n\nOverall, I would\u2019ve called the building\u2026.hazardous to one\u2019s health\u2026.over eight years ago. I can only assume that it\u2019s gotten much worse in the time since. Godspeed to whatever poor company gets stuck with \u201crevitalizing\u201d it, because there\u2019s not much left to \u201crevitalize\u201d besides the frame. Everything else needs to be completely demo\u2019d, removed and replaced, with exception to the revolving restaurant. It could probably just be renovated and be fine.\n\nTL;DR: The building was fucked 5 years ago, so renovating it should be a blast.\n\nEdit: 5 years ago. I was there in 2018. Had my times mixed up.",

So most of the types of businesses that would rent office space built mid size offices further east. So when they pulled out these high rises ended up not being maintained. \n\nIn the past two decades there has been an active push to revitalize downtown Memphis. \nDowntown has tons of medical facilities. St Jude, Le Bonheur, UT medical school, and tons of other hospitals and research centers. Most of those people make good money and want to live near by. They have refurbished a number of historic old high rises and turned them into condos. I\u2019m sure someone will get to this one eventually. \n\n Robert Lee Hall designed 100 N Main and 3 of the 4 tallest buildings in Memphis. They all look like ass. They are big concrete rectangles with zero character. Tear them down and build something interesting.",

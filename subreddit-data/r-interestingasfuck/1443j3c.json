I think it's in bad taste, but ultimately these are games.\n\nMeanwhile, google \"Kid Firearm Camp\" and read all about the options available for you to send your kids to NRA affiliated camps where playing with guns is the actual entire point of the camp. Here's a picture of children playing sniper with a long rifle and spotter at one of these camps. https://www.nrawc.org/media/4205/nra-whittington-center-adventure-camp-dsc_096126.jpg\n\n\"Taking kids to a firing range is wholesome fun\" is a nonsense rebuttal and defense of US gun/military culture. The US military actively funds action movies where it can look cool and spends millions on visibility events like fly-overs and stunts. We have a large contingent of people who think Christmas cards with their kids posing with guns is cute. We don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to \"Boy, the CCP sure likes to glorify their military to kids of all ages!\" (You want to talk about grooming...).",

That way the president can communicate quickly and effectively without the need to either (a) put some poor speechwriter massively on the spot and incur delay, or (b) subject the speaker to making ish up on the spot and potentially saying something insensitive, misleading, or upsetting. \n\nAlso: Notice how it\u2019s largely broken into paragraphs, and you can delete any individual section without affecting the meaning of the surrounding text. That\u2019s on purpose so they can revise or delete material at the last minute if it doesn\u2019t apply. If the astronauts were already dead due to catastrophic accident vs trapped on the moon and imminently doomed due to equipment failure, etc. \n\n\n It\u2019s a masterpiece.",

So maybe sledding? Except sledding usually implies snow/ice, and a sled glides on an undetermined  path with (mostly) free direction. If anything, sledding is closer to ice skating than whatever this grass ride is. So no, that doesn\u2019t work either. Well what about a \u201cgrass train\u201d except for the obvious that the word train typically implies an actual locomotive engine, not 1 single person sitting on a rinky-dink cart relying solely on gravity to move, with absolutely no way to go backwards besides just pushing yourself with your own two feet. So if \u201cski\u201d and \u201csled\u201d and \u201ctrain\u201d all don\u2019t sound exactly quite right to describe this ride in English, it\u2019s because English has no word for whatever this ride is. Rollercoaster, perhaps, is the best fit. Which is an oddly specific English word that translators (especially translating apps/softwares) might not fully understand, and would instead default to words like ski/sled/train since those words just come up more often in common parlance than \u201crollercoaster\u201d \n\nYou guys, this would be like a non-English speaker getting mad and feeling bamboozled and cursing out poor translation because \u201cSpace Mountain\u201d is not literally a mountain ride that takes you to space, in actuality, it\u2019s just like grass skiing back home but with more ups and downs and turns and it\u2019s in a dark warehouse instead of a wide open pasture. This ride being called \u201cGrass Skiing\u201d is not false advertising or mal intent. It\u2019s just lost in translation.",

Horrible place. So corrupt Duterte through a man out of a helicopter and bragged about it and there was another case where a nun who I would believe was from Australia was raped 32 times and said that he wished he would have been first. Worst pollution I've ever encountered corruption on a scale I've never seen in my life. A child pimp tried to steal my laptop I punched him in the face took him to the police station he was wanted on two other accounts and I watched the police beat him up and every day the girls that they pimped out their mothers and then would come to my condo and cry and plead with me to release the charges. I stayed an extra 3 months to be sure I was at his trial he got 3 years in jail. They get little kids addicted to methamphetamine and pimp them out to foreigners it doesn't sound like nice people to me. I was also Rob several times. Now you install Marcos relative to the guy who stole more from any government ever and hid in Hawaii. People burn plastic all day and if you tell them to stop they get very angry there's plastic Rivers and in Cebu there's so much plastic in the waves there's literally waves of plastic. The United States gave the Philippines its freedom because we don't want it it's such a trashy place with trashy people but we still help you fight abu sayaf we still give you millions and support we train your soldiers and have army bases. It is one of the worst countries I have been to. It's a beautiful place with all the islands but the Filipinos and the Chinese really screwed things up with their greed and corruption. I hope someday the Philippines changes into paradise but until that day I will not return. Sabawan was my favorite because there were no people on it. Leyte is ok Boracay is owned by the Chinese in the casinos. Moalboal is pretty cool if you like swimming with whale sharks. When I was there even though I was on the third floor people would climb up and get into my house and steal things. It really is so sad that such a beautiful and extraordinary place has so many problems just because of the people. I lived there for 3 years I kept trying to find a place to retire but it's just too dangerous especially as a white male with lots of money. I get targeted everywhere. Even in Cebu Abu sayuf used to abduct people right off the shores hold them from Ransom and kill them.",

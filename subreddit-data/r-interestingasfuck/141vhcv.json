Normally in my moon edits I keep the colors of the minerals subtle, but I decided to have some fun with the saturation this month. I shot the photos with a $300 Dobsonian telescope and my old Nikon mirrorless camera.\n\nThe colors are invisible to the human eye but were all captured by my camera (stacking/combining dozens of photos to improve the color signal). The way we process these images is by increasing the saturation, which increases the intensity of the colors that are already in the image. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/140tnnv/this_months_strawberry_mineral_moon_i_stacked/jn0c64f/) for a great analogy.",

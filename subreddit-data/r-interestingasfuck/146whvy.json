Females are many times larger than the males, who are barely bigger than the female's fins. Their mating is bizarre too- the male will bite into the female, and effectively fuse themselves into her, becoming one with her circulatory system and living the rest of his life attached to her, providing her with sperm while she provides him with nutrients.",

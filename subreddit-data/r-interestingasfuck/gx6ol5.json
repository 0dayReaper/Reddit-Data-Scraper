Everything you\u2019ve probably heard is a lie. Specifically, the most discussed \u201csolutions\u201d to police violence have no evidence of effectiveness. For example, Body cams don\u2019t reduce police violence: https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1\n\n2. There is no evidence that better police training programs or \u201cimplicit bias\u201d training changes police behavior. The trainings vary in quality and rarely result in any accountability/changes in decision-making. Don\u2019t put this at the top of your agenda. Next, what works...\n\n3. More restrictive state and local policies governing police use of force are associated with significantly lower rates of police shootings/killings by police. This is backed by 30+ years of research. Specific policies that work are identified here: http://useofforceproject.org/\n\n4. Demilitarization. Police departments that get more military weapons from the federal government kill more people. You can stop that from happening through local and state policy. Montana (Red state) has gone the furthest on this. Your state can and should follow. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885\n\n5. Police Union Contracts. Every 4-6 years your police department\u2019s accountability system is re-negotiated. Purging misconduct records, reinstating fired officers, department funding - it\u2019s in the contract. Cities with worse contracts have higher police violence rates. https://www.checkthepolice.org/\n\n6. Predictive policing on the police. Yes, use the technology against them. Data on use of force, complaints and lawsuits can be used to identify officers who are most likely to shoot someone next and prevent it from happening. Use the methodology to save lives. https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-predicting-bad-police-behavior-20190801-xumudeezmjalbbpmqwyvh26tdi-story.html\n\n7. Invest in alternatives to police as crime prevention strategies. Every 10 additional organizations in a city reduces the murder rate by 9%; reduces violent crime rate by 6%; and reduces property crime rate by 4%. The Research: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122417736289\n\n8. Establish non-police alternatives to 911 calls involving people with mental illness. For example, 1 in 5 of the 911 calls in Eugene, Oregon are diverted to mental health first responders instead of police to respond. A successor is being scaled in Portland.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-mental-health-experts-not-police-are-the-first-responders-1543071600\n\n9. Resource the Department of Justice (after the current president is voted out) to initiate more investigations of police departments. Departments that receive federal intervention have 25-30% fewer police shootings than those that do not. https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings\n\n10. Know change is not only possible, it\u2019s already happened in some places. Oakland police shot 8 people on average each year 5 years ago and, after these interventions were implemented, they had 0 shootings this year, 1 last year (the officers were fired) and 0 the year before. Lives saved.\n\n11. Finally, there is a catalog of an extensive range of research studies and other information detailing potential solutions to police violence at https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research\n\n12. And if you don\u2019t have time to read the research right now, most of this research is presented in rapid succession in this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=1niaq51Z2Uw\n\nIn order to establish these findings they had to 1) build the most comprehensive database of police violence in the US; 2) conduct analyses of police use of force policies and union contracts in the 100 largest US cities; 3) track every state policing bill passed in the past 5 years; 4) track every research study published on the subject over the past five years and evaluate for quality; and 5) meticulously catalog the findings so they can be broadly accessible. And all that with little to no funding. Next up: evaluating the 1,000 largest police departments in the US. Stay tuned.\n\n(Source of all of the above: a thread from Samuel Sinyangwe @ https://twitter.com/samswey/status/1180655701271732224)",

Almost all implementations of body cams don't constantly record, they have to specifically push the button before they suspect something is going to happen to start the recording. There are now some places experimenting with capturing the 30 seconds before the button press, that's about it. There are both logistical and ethical barriers to having constantly recording bodycam footage.\n\nThe police don't have to \"turn off\" their camera. They just have to not turn them on. This is part of the reason that although body cams are good and should be pushed for, they are not the most effective policies for reducing the prevalence of police misconduct.",

There are other, better, more humane ways.\n\nAlso, important to all this: **DEFUND DOES NOT MEAN DISBAND**\n\nImagine how much better our communities could be if big (and small) cities didn't spend up to 50% or more of their entire budget on their wasteful, violent police forces and instead put that money towards improving the conditions that spawn crime in the first place. If police officers had a constructive and rehabilitative rather than adversarial and punitive approach to law enforcement.\n\nNo other first-world country spends nearly as much as we do on policing. I go travel in Europe and even small cities spend big on public arts support, community health projects, parks and recreation and festivals. I come home to my mid-sized American town and the water fountains at my local park don't even work anymore; haven't for a decade or more (just a small example). These things have been completely abandoned because the city is grossly misappropriating funds.\n\nEDIT: cause some people are being dicks about it, when I say \"Europe\" I mean \"those many countries in Europe which generally have high standards of living and  social safety nets that frankly put America's to shame\". Even some outside of that definition fit what I'm saying.",

So protest the federal government all you want because it is needed but the real change if it is going to happen will come from every city and town IN America changing rules.\n\nProtest your state and petition your STATE legislators to enact state policing guidelines that layout the guardrails for how police departments operate tactics they use and the accountability they must face.\n\nTrump is a figure head target and gets The news coverage. But he will not like to hear that he holds little to no power whatsoever to change anything. Your leaders in your town, village, city are the real power. And this must be a two pronged approach.... City/state leaders changing policing policies AND local prosecutors changing theirs as well.",

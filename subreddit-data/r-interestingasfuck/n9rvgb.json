I'm a biologist and so obviously have a better grip on evolution etc than most, but it's incredible just how similar we are physiologically to other mammals. Like we literally all have the exact same parts. These squirrels have the exact same parts we do, but in different proportions. All mammals do. And then there's people who think they're not sentient - sure intelligence may be lacking but all mammals are still just more or less different models of our own biology!\n\nI'm pretty sure if you chase our lineage far back enough we end up as some squirrelish animal. Intelligence aside, we're really not that different at all to our mammalian cousins! We share so so much more biology with these animals than we have differences and yet as a species still treat them like shit for the most part :(.",

What I don't understand is, why are you running up to the other dog only to snap at them? Like why? If the other dog came up to you first, sure I get it. They are in your personal space.

The red ones are more skittish and cautious, which makes them better able to survive in a rural area with more predators, but unwilling to live in much more active urban areas. Grey squirrels are the opposite, as they're willing to live anywhere, but that lack of caution makes them easier prey in a rural environment. I'm in the US, and moving 40 minutes away to a more rural location resulted in seeing red squirrels and chipmunks instead of grey squirrels, and tons of deer, foxes &amp; coyotes.",

In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.",

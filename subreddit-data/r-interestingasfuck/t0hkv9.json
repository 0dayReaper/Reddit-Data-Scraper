If your military and police are overwhelmed or unhappy, they can see to it that you are overthrown easily by the mobs of people they're holding back. You can pay as much as you'd like but if the common person stands up and protests, the overwhelming numbers can demand that Putin withdraw his troops in fear of him being possibly overthrown by the negative reception.\n\nIf all citizens in russia stopped working, the war effort would grind to a halt. If their police were overworked and spread too thin, there'd be no choice but to withdraw from the local threat that is pounding down on his door.\n\nIt's not easy but the millions of lives there from just ordinary people could make a difference and save us from something horrific",

And whoever translated this speech did a great job. Everything is on point. I hope that this speech will go down in history as a example of true leadership and courage.\nJust earlier today I was watching parts of his shows from when he did his best work as a young comedian back in the early 2000. He is fluent in Russian and good at word play and intricacies of he language. And he was just as good at that as he is at being a leader of his nation now.",

My dad lives in Ukraine and is currently prepping to get out with his wife and daughter and escape to the UK, as he's a British citizen.\n\nHe took a 900km train journey yesterday with his daughter just to get an emergency travel document for her. My half-sister. She's 10, for fuck's sake. They managed to get it, but that was the easy part. Once he gets home he has to pack what he can and then drive north and get to the border, avoiding warzones, and keep driving until he gets to England.\n\nI'm fucking terrified for him, can't imagine how he feels. He's having to leave his mother-in-law and stepson at home because they won't be able to get in to the UK. The mother-in-law just lost her husband 2 weeks ago after a long battle with cancer.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe just to vent and distract myself from it all swirling around in my head.\n\nFuck Putin. This was an amazing speech but it only amplifies the severity of what is going on, and the life-changing consequences this conflict will bring.\n\nI'm not a spiritual person. I don't believe in a god. Nor does my dad. When I asked him yesterday, while he was in a taxi on the way to the consulate, if there was anything I could do to help, he replied \"how are you and God nowadays? Pray...\".\n\nThat fucked me up almost as much as this speech did",

Silence. Although the silence should be in Donbas. That is why I come today with an appeal to tall citizens of Russian. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than 2000km of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers, thousands of military units. \r  \n\r  \nYour leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step? This step can become the start of a huge war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. \r  \nAny provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are already free. \r  \n\r  \nThey remember their past, and are building their future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told every day on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real. \r  \n\r  \nYou are being told that we are Nazis. But how can a nation be called Nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate Nazism. How can I be a Nazi, when my grandfather survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture? Neighbors are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d.\r  \n\r  \nWe are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully. Calmly. Truthfully. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that I am ordering to attack Donbas. To shoot. To bomb without question. Although there are questions: To shoot who? To bomb what?\r  \n\r  \nDonetsk? Where I have been dozens of times? I have seen their faces and eyes. \r  \nArtema? Where I\u2019ve walked with friends before?\r  \nDonbas Arena? Where I have rooted with the locals for our boys during the Euros?\r  \nShcherbakova Park? Where we drank together after our team lost?\r  \nLugansk? The home of my best friend\u2019s mom? The place where his father is buried?\r  \n\r  \nNote that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom? Many of you have visited Ukraine before. Many of you have relatives in Ukraine. \r  \n\r  \nSome of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainians. You know our character, you know our people, you know our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our power. \r  \n\r  \nWe are not alone. It\u2019s true. Ukraine is support by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about \u201cpeace at any cost.\u201d We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone\u2019s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone\u2019s right to live without threat. \r  \n\r  \nAll of this is important to us. All of this is important for peace. I know this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don\u2019t want war. Not cold, not hot, not hybrid. But if we are threatened, if someone tries to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. \r  \n\r  \nNot attack\u2014defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs\u2014our faces. \r  \n\r  \nWar is a big distress, and it has a big price, in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. \r  \n\r  \nA lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands, tens of thousands of deaths. \r  \n\r  \nYou are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won\u2019t be in the future.  You want security guarantees from NATO. We also want guarantees of our security. The security of Ukraine\u2014from you, from Russia, and from other guarantors of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbors. That is why are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. \r  \n\r  \nWe are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of guarantees. No one will have guarantees of security. Who is going to suffer from this most? The people. Who doesn\u2019t want this more than anyone? The people. Who can prevent all this from happening? The people. \r  \n\r  \nIf these people are among you\u2014I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-ups. Tiktokers, and more. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old young, fathers, and most importantly\u2014mothers. \r  \n\r  \nJust as much as the people in Ukraine, not matter how much they try to convince of the opposite. I know that my speech will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth.  And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it\u2019s too late. And if the authorities of Russian don\u2019t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you. \r  \n\r  \nDo the people of Russian want war? I would like to be able to answer this. But the answer depends only on you: the citizens of the Russian Federation. Thank you.",

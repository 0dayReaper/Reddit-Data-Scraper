                                                    "comment": "A man gets a job as a train conductor. For years he\u2019s been great at his job. When the train arrives at the station he blows the whistle to announce the arrival and for the opening of the doors. After everyone gets off and on he, blows the whistle for the closing of the doors and the train departure.\n\nIt was a pretty mindless job and one day he was working away, blowing his whistle, the trains came and went, and on one particular train he thought everyone had boarded and he blew the whistle, when an old lady with her dog was still getting on the train. The doors closed and chopped the lady clean in half, killing her. The man being responsible for this woman\u2019s death was tried in court and found guilty of manslaughter. The sentence was death by the chair. He was placed in a cell until his execution. A few hours before he was to be killed, the warden came to his cell.\n\n\u201cYou get one last meal, anything. You name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d The man said. \u201cWell if I were to have one last meal it would be 50kg of bananas.\u201d\n\nThe warden looked stunned, he wasn\u2019t sure if he heard him right, but the man looked sincere and who was he to deny him this last meal.\n\nSo he buys 50kg of bananas and takes them back to the cell. The warden looks in amazement and disgust as the man devours the bananas skin and all.\n\nAfter stuffing himself and making quite a mess, the man is led to the electric chair. He\u2019s strapped in, and the electrodes attached. The executioner places his hand on the lever \u201c3... 2... 1...\u201d he pulls the lever and grimaces, only to find the man is perfectly fine. He pulls its again, and again but still nothing happens. They check the wires but everything is okay, the man just won\u2019t die.\n\nThe warden is stunned \u201cWell, only an act of God could save you. Clearly you just aren\u2019t meant to die. You're free to go.\u201d\n\nSo the man leaves and gets another job as a train conductor. He\u2019s doing the same thing, blowing the whistle for arrivals and departures. The trains come and go when one day all the passengers had gotten on board and he blew his whistle right as a little boy dropped his ball out the doors of the train. He went to retrieve it from the platform when BAM he was caught between the doors and sliced in two.\n\nThe man was tried and found guilty of murder, he was sent straight to prison to be executed the next day. He was sitting, stewing in his cell when the warden came along.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s your last meal... again, what do you want this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell since you\u2019re asking, I\u2019d like 50kg of bananas please.\u201d The man says to the disgruntled warden.\nThe warden shakes his head and exhales in disbelief. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d So he leaves to buy 50kg of bananas.\nHe returns and gives the bananas to the ravenous man and watches as he lobs them down his throat. To the wardens horror, he\u2019s not even chewing them anymore just chucking them down whole. The man finishes and is taken away to be executed.\n\nThe executioner is surprised to see him again. The man is strapped in and attached to the electrodes once again. The executioner grips the handle that will end the mans life and yells \u201c3... 2... 1...\u201d and yanks the lever. Only to his absolute bewilderment, nothing happens. They check the wires, the chair the power and pull again and again but the man remains perfectly fine. By now the warden cannot believe his eyes, but the executioner proclaims \u201cThis is an act of God, clearly you are not meant to die, you have been spared yet again and are free to go\u201d\n\nSo the man leaves.\n\nAnd again gets a job as a train conductor. He\u2019s blowing his whistle and sending the trains off only this time he\u2019s learnt from his mistakes. He\u2019s intently looking for people every time a train comes and for several months he goes by without killing anyone.\n\nUntil one fateful day when he was doing his job and he saw the most beautiful woman he had ever the seen. As she strutted by he whistled and she turned and gave him a wink. Only the train driver heard the whistle and closed the door, crushing a business man, splitting him in twain.\n\nHe was seized and sent to court, tried and, for the third time, found guilty of murder. The judge was done with him and sentenced him to death that day. As he was sitting in his cell once again, the warden came to him.\n\n\u201c50kg of bananas?\u201d He asked the man\n\n\u201c50kg of bananas.\u201d The man replied\n\nThe warden walked away, baffled at the events of the past couple of months. He returned with 50kg of bananas and gave them to the man only this time he didn\u2019t finish all the bananas, as he had eaten quite a large breakfast. The warden marched him to the electric chair and strapped him in, curious as to what would happen. The executioner is also intrigued as to whether or not the man will cheat death yet again. He grasps the lever and counts down. \u201c3... 2... 1...\u201d he pulls the lever and ....... nothing happens.\n\nThe executioner has just given up at this point and says \u201cWell it\u2019s an act of God. Clearly you just aren\u2019t meant to die yet, just promise me you won\u2019t get another job at that damn train company.\u201d\n\nThe man makes no promises and walks away, a free man. The warden runs up to him. Panting he asks.\n\u201cI have to ask, how have you cheated the electric chair so many times? Is it the bananas?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the man replies calmly, \u201cI\u2019m just a really bad conductor.\u201d",

Its one long continuous  track that goes through  numerous  tunnels and along multiple  rivers.  You can fallow the tracks along one river and you will come to a specific  hillside that is filled with fossils. The rumor is that back in the day a entire whale skeleton  was found at that location.  As far as I'm aware you can still walk through all of the tunnels and if u want to do the 30 min walk you'll come back with as many fossils  as u can cary.",

They did it to prevent the slight side to side undulation you get with conical wheels... and created a shrieking monstrosity. They recently had Bombardier design a new wheel shape to address the noise and the track damage. Extensive computer modeling came up with a new \"tapered\" wheel shape that reduces the noise by 50%... In other words, they made the wheels as close to the standard conical wheels as they could while retaining compatibility with the stupid flat-top sharp-edged custom rails they made for the stupid cylindrical wheels.\n\nThere's a lot of embarrassing engineering hubris in the story of BART's design. They actually thought they were designing the commuter train of the future that the whole world would be adopting. As if anyone was going to pull up their existing rails to replace them with a completely incompatible wider gauge 5'6\" track!",

I find once someone gets drunk or too fucked up, they\u2019ll either make there way on the couch or someone will put them there, and it\u2019s calms them down and keeps them distracted. Just look up Slow TV trains.",

Based on the video, he's probably out by Ocotillo, CA which is at the bottom of the hill on the 8 East (I grew up in San Diego, it's the 8, not interstate 8).\n\nHe's headed toward the Goat Canyon Trestle, which at one point was the largest freestanding wooden trestle in the Western Hemisphere. It was called The Impossible Railroad, because it's way out in the middle of nowhere and Spreckles and Co. who built it, was told it would be impossible. This is the same Spreckles who developed most of downtown San Diego.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_Canyon_Trestle",

Have to do a lot more training before getting your licence and the aircraft are meticulously checked before every flight. In addition, all of the vital components have redundancies so if one fails then there\u2019s two or three backups, including the pilot themselves. Autopilot is assisting when in the air, the most concentration and input is take off and landing which is where I believe the majority of crashes are. \n\nThe pilots also fly the same route all the time, which I guess helps, but could also make you complacent. \n\nI also imagine having the responsibility of hundreds of people in your hands and also being heavily scrutinised for any infractions helps.\n\nTotally get why people have a fear of flying and it\u2019s not \u2018normal\u2019 to travel at that altitude in something so big. But it\u2019s also not technically \u2018normal\u2019 to travel at speed in a car, but most people do this at least once a week from being a baby so it doesn\u2019t feel unusual. \n\nI think it\u2019s somewhat common knowledge to know a plane can manage to limp along if one of the engines fails, but I read somewhere that even if both fail and a plane is at regular cruising altitude it has something like 70 miles gliding range to find a landing, which is reassuring if true. Unless you\u2019re flying across the middle of the ocean, in which case you better hope they nose dive it in at a harsh angle so you at least vapourise instantly instead of freezing or drowning to death.",

Of course, this does not take into account car maintenance or parts, only expended fuel.\n\nI drive my car less than 10000km per year, so even one overseas trip will pollute more in a week than I do in a year of driving alone.",

Still, aviation accounts for about 2-3% of emissions worldwide, and on average airplanes have become 1% more efficient year on year. People like to travel, thats just the bottom line, but we need to push harder on reducing emissions from airplanes. A LOT of work is being done by manufacturers to reduce fuel burn and switching to new alternatives, partly (some would say mostly) because of economics of using less fuel per trip, which is a huge portion of an airlines cost. \n\nIn many instances airports are home to wildlife in otherwise dense cities (think immense open areas etc. birds are generally a problem, however) and a lot of work is being done to reduce noise both operationally (the way we approach airports) and and on the development side of things. \n\nTraveling is not the issue, airplanes are not the issue. Its just the stuff coming out the back unfortunately, and that needs to change, fast.",

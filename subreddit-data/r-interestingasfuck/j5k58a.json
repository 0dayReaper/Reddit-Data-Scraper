Your trash doesn\u2019t belong here.\u201d I\u2019ve never been more afraid but it really stuck with me. Haven\u2019t ever littered since and if things miss the trash/I hesitate on picking up after myself, I feel that same exact guilt.

I live in a tourism dependent area, one of the biggest tourist spots in the world, and tourists do more no harm than the local residents.  It's just people, and really no different than how a boar rooting around in the dirt also destroys plants.  But all that tourism $$$ can be invested in saving and protecting the local environment and that happens here too, why, because everyone benefits from people who simply love money to people who live the environment.  If we were just some poor island because we didn't have tourism, we would have a lot more real environmental destruction, not just some superficial scratches on the fastest growing grass in the world.",

Like when a statistic is presented as \"x (in millions)\".\n\nIt should also be plainly obvious, for anyone who's ever been to a national park, that each park is not receiving a mere $10,000. What? Do you think the hundred or so employees at any given park all split that budget and live off of $100 a year?\n\nUse your brains, people!",

You see people not as humans but criminals out to get you every step of the way.\n\nJudge humanity in the harshest light possible and make policies not out of respect for the well being of society but rather the fear of punishment. The entire reason why people are so eager for death sentences and if not that then decade long sentences for non violent crimes.\n\nThink of how tragic it would be if someone took you away from your home and locked you up in your room for a week. That single week could tear your entire life apart. You might end up losing your pets, your sick family members, kids, etc.\n\nThat's the entire debate around religion in America too, I remember Stephen Fry getting asked \"Well if there is no religion to guide me or the fear of god then what's stopping me from jumping out of my seat and strangling you, raping women, etc\" I'm paraphrasing ofc and Stephen Fry replied \"I don't want to do that, why would I want to hurt you?\"\n\nIts this entire deranged mindset that other people are filthy savage animals who would do the worst to you if you don't control them through fearful manipulative tactics. A lot of that I reckon is projection OFC, its the liar who once learns how easy it is to actually deceive someone has the most damaging trust issues.",

I hated seeing litter in nature and I realized I have no real excuse to just walk by it and leave it there. There is a noticeable difference in how quickly trash accumulates on trails I've cleaned previously. People are less likely to litter in the first place if they don't see any litter. \n\nMy only rules are \"no piece of trash is too small to pick up\" and \"leave the poop bags where they are because that's fucking gross.\" I've seen and discovered some very cool insects and plants on my hikes specifically because I wandered off to pick up a piece of trash. When I started I was pulling one and two grocery bags full of trash out of there. Now I definitely notice it accumulates more slowly, especially because I try to keep on top of it. I can usually use the same bag multiple times in my hikes now.\n\nTop offenders are cigarette asses and the tiny corners that are torn off plastic packaging. That shit accumulates. There's never not butts on the trail.",

I don\u2019t see it slowing down any either. If you can now work remotely, why not work remotely at the beach instead of the overcrowded city you live in? I think we will see a permanent growth in some of the popular tourist areas as folks are able to move and work from home.",

There were definitely a good amount of trash along trails and the multi-use pathways throughout the park. The worse part of this season was the amount of visitors that got away with violations. The park service had to limit the amount of law enforcement officers and seasonals they could hire, so most of the land couldn't be patrolled consistently. The LEOs were also super busy with responding to dispatch and conducting search and rescues, so they didn't have time to write tickets for the \"minor\" violations (for this season, minor violations meant bringing pets on trails, cutting down trees, and parking on vegetation or in front of the \"no parking\" sign).",

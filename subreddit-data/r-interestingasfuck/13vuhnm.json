So they're all crumbling and narrow and kinda dangerous. One of the bits I climbed was in crumbling state, and up in the mountains. So it's really high up and not secure at all, and while we were doing the first part of the climb, I couldn't stop shaking because of how narrow the wall was and how high up we were. I was nearly crying with relief when we got to the first rest point",

All the parts and plates are stamped with country of origin and most came from Europe and Japan. Since we built pressure vessels and all our work was almost always 100% x-ray, we had stipulations in our blueprints from the companies that subcontracted us with approved countries of origin for raw materials, which was basically any country BUT China. \n\nI'm sure less critical applications probably do use Chinese steels, and China's manufacturing has probably improved in the last few decades so maybe things are different now, but when I was in the field the subpar quality of their steels was well known and often avoided.",

Her brain insists that she will fall sideways off of the arm and down to her end. She fights to overcome this with the shaking of her leg as it resists normal movements. I experienced something similar at the top of a stadium. My brain insisted we would fall all the way to the field. It was hundreds of feet below but still stadiums are angled. I knew I would fall to the next row or two. It\u2019s ridiculous and I would have to fall/fly if I wanted to reach the field. But my brain insisted this impossible thing would happen.",

But lift the platform even 20ft or more from the ground and suddenly we don\u2019t trust our own ability to stand without falling over. I think it\u2019s a frame-of-reference thing.

At the time I had no idea what I was seeing and felt I had been blessed by the sight.  The murmuration didn't happen at a distance but right over top of me and was the most incredible thing I ever saw.  It is not a silent event as the birds are extremely loud, with the noise of their wings setting the beat to their song.  I began believing that the birds were behaving this way on purpose taking part in a strange and little understood spiritual event unique to their species.  In the same way that a vespers mass is performed just for the sake of hearing their own voices a performance to the setting sun.      \n\n.",

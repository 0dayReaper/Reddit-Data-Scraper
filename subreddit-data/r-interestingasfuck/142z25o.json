On about day 10 of the trip, we got into a nice sized storm, spraying across the deck and hitting the bridge (some 25 meters above deck, 120 meters aft of the bow). Then watertight door alarm started going off. The shaking and pounding had knocked the sensor loose on the watertight door that leads to on deck from the forward container well. \n\nAt roughy the same time, half the liferings had broken loose, as had the spill cleanup kits, and a few other things.\n\nI was glad to just be along for the ride, working on the navigation system.",

Deck hands start at around $70-80k I believe, but I could be off on that number (that\u2019s a tug company based in nyc).  There\u2019s also 4 year maritime colleges and a mariner school in md that sets you up for entry level jobs.",

To put it into perspective, now, today, the 21st century, more than two dozen large ships sink or otherwise go missing taking their crews with them, every year.\n\nSo far, it hasn't happened to a cruise ship, but they take great pains to avoid foul weather. But if it ever does.... it will be one of the worst maritime disasters in history.",

It shut out the sky, and it was racing towards them. The Leopard\u2018s stern rose, rose: the enormous wave passed smoothly under her counter, and there through the flying spume lay the Waakzaamheid below, running down the far slow. \u2018When you please, Mr Burton,\u2019 said Jack to the gunner. \u2018A hole in her foretopsail might make it split.\u2019 The larboard gun roared out and instantly the cabin was filled with smoke. No hole: no fall of shot either. Jack, to starboard, had the Dutchman in his dispart sight. A trifle of elevation and he pulled the lanyard. Nothing happened: flying spray had soaked the lock. \u2018Match,\u2019 he cried, but by the time he had the glowing end in his hand the Waakzaamheid was below his line of sight, below the depression of the gun. From down there in the trough she fired up, a distant wink of flame, and she got in another couple of shots before the grey-green hill of water parted them again.\n\n\u2018May I suggest a cigar, sir?\u2019 said Moore. \u2018One can hold it in one\u2019s mouth.\u2019 He was acting as sponger and second captain, and his face was six inches from Jack\u2019s: he was encased in oilskins and there was nothing of the Marine about him but his fine red face and the neat stock showing under his chin.\n\n\u2018A capital idea,\u2019 said Jack, and in the calm of the trough, before the Waakzaamheid appeared again, Moore lit him a cigar from the glowing match in its tub.\n\nThe Leopard began to rise, the Dutchman appeared, black in the white water of the breaking crests high up there, and both nine-pounders went off together. The guns leapt back, the crews worked furiously, grunting, no words, sponged, loaded, and ran them out again. Another shot, and this time Jack saw his ball, dark in the haze of lit water, flying at its mark: he could not follow it home, but the line was true, a little low. Now they were on the crest, and the cabin was filled with wind and water mingled, unbreathable: the gun-crews worked without the slightest pause, worked through and through.\n\nDown, down the slope amidst the white wreckage of the wave, the guns run out and waiting. Across the hollow and up the other side. \u2018I believe I caught his splash,\u2019 said Moore. \u2018Twenty yards short of our starboard quarter.\u2019\n\n\u2018So did I,\u2019 said Burton. \u2018He wants to knock our rudder, range along, and give us a broadside, the bloody-minded dog.\u2019\n\nThe Waakzaamheid over the crest again: Jack poured the priming into the touch-hole with his horn, guarding it with the flat of his hand, the cigar clenched between his teeth and the glow kept bright; and this bout each gun fired three times before the Leopard mounted too high, racing up and up, pursued by the Dutchman\u2019s shot. On and on: an enormous switchback, itself in slow, majestic motion, but traversed at a racing speed in which the least stumble meant a fall. Alternate bursts of fire, aimed and discharged with such an intensity of purpose that the men did not even see the storm of flying water that burst in upon them at each crest. On and on, the Waakzaamheid gaining visibly.\n\nHere was Babbington at his side, waiting for a pause. \u2018Take over, Moore,\u2019 said Jack, as the gun ran in. He stepped over the train-tackle, and Babbington said, \u2018She\u2019s hit our mizzen-top, sir, fair and square.\u2019\n\nJack nodded. She was coming far too close: point-blank range now, and the wind to help her balls. \u2018Start the water, all but a ton; and try the jib, one-third in.\u2019\n\nBack to the gun as it ran out. Now it was the Waakzaamheid\u2018s turn to fire, and fire she did, striking the Leopard\u2018s stern-post high up: a shrewd knock that jarred the ship as she was on the height of the wave, and a moment later a green sea swept through the deadlights.\n\n\u2018Good practice in this sea, Mr Burton,\u2019 said Jack.\n\nThe gunner turned his streaming face, and its fixed fierce glare broke into a smile. \u2018Pretty fair, sir, pretty fair. But if I did not get home two shots ago, my name is Zebedee.\u2019\n\nThe flying Leopard drew a little way ahead with the thrust of her jib, a hundred yards or so; and the switchback continued, the distances the same. It was the strangest gunnery, with its furious activity and then the pause, waiting to be fired at; the soaking at the crest, the deck awash; the intervening wall of water; the repetition of the whole sequence. No order; none of the rigid fire-discipline of the gun-deck; loud, gun-deafened conversation between the bouts. The dread of being pooped by the great seas right there in front of their noses, rising to blot out the sun with unfailing regularity, and of broaching to, hardly affected the cabin.\n\nA savage roar from Burton\u2019s crew. \u2018We hit her port-lid,\u2019 cried Bonden, the second captain. \u2018They can\u2019t get it closed.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then we are all in the same boat,\u2019 said Moore. \u2018Now the Dutchmen will have a wet jacket every time she digs in her bows, and I wish they may like it, ha ha!\u2019\n\nA short-lived triumph. A midshipman came to report the jib carried clean away \u2013 Babbington had all in hand \u2013 was trying to set a storm-staysail \u2013 half the water was pumped out.\n\nBut although the Leopard was lighter she felt the loss of the jib; the Waakzaamheid was coming up, and now the vast hill of sea separated them only for seconds. If the Leopard did not gain when all her water was gone, the upper-deck guns would have to follow it: anything to draw ahead and preserve the ship. The firing was more and more continuous; the guns grew hot, kicking clear on the recoil, and first Burton and then Jack reduced the charge.\n\nNearer and nearer, so that they were both on the same slop, no trough between them: a hole in the Dutchman\u2019s foretopsail, but it would not split, and three shots in quick succession struck the Leopard\u2018s hull, close to her rudder. Jack had smoked five cigars to the butt, and his mouth was scorched and dry. He was staring along the barrel of his gun, watching for the second when the Waakzaamheid\u2018s bowsprit should rise above his sight, when he saw her starboard chaser fire. A split second later he stabbed his cigar down on the priming and there was an enormous crash, far louder than the roar of the gun.\n\nHow much later he looked up he could not tell. Nor, when he did look up, could he quite tell what was afoot. He was lying by the cabin bulkhead with Killick holding his head and Stephen sewing busily; he could feel the passage of the needle and of the thread, but no pain. He stared right and left. \u2018Hold still,\u2019 said Stephen. He felt the red-hot stabbing now, and everything fell into place. The gun had not burst: there was Moore fighting it. He had been dragged clear \u2013 hit \u2013 a splinter, no doubt. Stephen and Killick crouched over him as a green sea gushed in: then Stephen cut the thread, whipped a wet cloth round his ears, one eye and forehead, and said, \u2018Do you hear me now?\u2019 He nodded; Stephen moved on to another man lying on the deck; Jack stood up, fell, and crawled over to the guns. Killick tried to hold him, but Jack thrust him back, clapped on to the tackle and helped run out the loaded starboard gun. Moore bent over it, cigar in hand, and from behind him Jack could see the Waakzaamheid twenty yards away, huge, black-hulled, throwing the water wide. As Moore\u2019s hand came down, Jack automatically stepped aside; but he was still stupid, he moved slow, and the recoiling gun flung him to the deck again. On hands and knees he felt for the train-tackle in the smoke, found it as the darkness cleared, and tallied on. But for a moment he could not understand the cheering that filled the cabin, deafening his ears: then through the shattered deadlights he saw the Dutchman\u2019s foremast lurch, lurch again, the stays part, the mast and sail carry away right over the bows.\n\nThe Leopard reached the crest. Green water blinded him. It cleared, and through the bloody haze running from his cloth he saw the vast breaking wave with the Waakzaamheid broadside on its curl, on her beam-ends, broached to. An enormous, momentary turmoil of black hull and white water, flying spars, rigging that streamed wild for a second, and then nothing at all but the great hill of green-grey with foam racing upon it.\n\n\u2018My God, oh my God,\u2019 he said. \u2018Six hundred men.\u2019",

You have a complex system of fluid and nerves in your ears that is responsible for orienting yourself in space. When that system starts to get jumbled up, like when you\u2019re rocking in a boat or in a car, you need a way to ground yourself and tell your brain what\u2019s happening. Usually that\u2019s looking at horizon to orient yourself in a stable, fixed object. Otherwise, it\u2019s essentially the same as having vertigo. There are also glasses people can wear that have four circles: two in the normal glasses positioned and two oriented perpendicular to those that run by your temples in your periphery. There is colored fluid in the circles that allows you to visualize what\u2019s happening in your body and orient yourself. They look very stupid but people report that they work for them. It\u2019s pretty much the same principle so I could see it actually working. Look up car sickness glasses. They\u2019re really funny.",

                            "comment": "So, story time. (Squids will understand all this, but I'll try to explain anything that isn't obvious for the landlubbers).\n\nI was on a reserve Fleet LST. Our job was to wait for another ship of our class to be unable to meet its commitment, and we would go in their place.\n\nAs such we spent a lot of time tied up at the pier waiting. When the ship is in port like that we got electrical power from a substation on the pier. Sometimes the breaker there would trip, and as an electrician, I (or one of my fellow electrician's) would have to go ashore and reset it.\n\nWhen this happened the noise of the ship would just die. Every pump, every ventilation motor, every piece of electronic gear, the hum from every transformer just went silent. If you were asleep the change in noise would wake you up (especially if you were the guy that had to go turn the power back on).\n\nThere was emergency lighting aboard the ship (this was the '80s, things might be different now) in the form of \"battle lanterns\". These were battery operated lanterns hooked up to ship's power. If the power went off the little relay inside the battle lantern would go dead, and a spring operated switch (normally held open when powered) would close and connect the battery and light up. But, sometimes they didn't work, more often the battery would be dead (because someone didn't do their PMS), or the battery had just been stolen. And when that happened you would find  yourself in a water tight steel box. With no light. None. It was utterly black.\n\nWhich sets the scene for my tale.\n\nA shipboard buddy of mine was getting married and he invited a few of us from the shjip to go to the wedding. But, he didn't want any uniforms so we all had to wear jackets and ties.\n\nThis buddy's father was from Northern Ireland, as were many of the wedding guests, so this was an Irish wedding. There was far more drinking there than I had anticipated or had ever seen before. Nonetheless I did my best to match those around me drink for drink. I remember the wedding ceremony, and the beginning of the reception, but beyond that... nothing.  I got completely shit-faced, black-out hammered.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, after the wedding the other guys at the wedding dragged me back to ship, down to my berthing space and stuffed me in my bunk. Now, the bunks aboard ship were stacked three high. You slept on your locker (about two feet wide, six feet long, and a foot deep. You had about 18 inches of space between the top of  your bunk and the bottom of the next one up.  There was a sheet of steel between my head and the feet of the guy next to me, the hull of the ship to my left and a steel bulkhead(the wall between our berthing compartment and the next one) at my feet. In addition, near my feet were vertical lockers where we hung our nice uniforms. So, though my bunk was six feet long, the last few feet of it were blocked by these lockers.\n\nSo there I lay, black-out drunk, when the power from the pier went off.  The change in environmental noise woke me up.\n\nIt was silent. Completely silent.\n\nIt was black. As black as black can be. There was no light.\n\nAnd I had no idea where I was, how I had gotten there, or even when it was.\n\nSo I sat up, and promptly bonked my head on the bunk above me. Huh.\n\nI reached up and  explored it with my hands. Flat steel. I followed it up towards my head and ran into a vertical steel wall there. What the...?\n\nI reached to my left, a steel wall, I kicked with my feet steel at  the other end and a wall to my right. My hands came to rest on my chest. Why was I wearing a jacket and tie?\n\nThen suddenly it dawned on me.\n\nI had been buried alive.\n\nI started pounding on the bottom of the bunk above me, screaming as loud as I could, \"I'm alive! I'm alive! Let me out!\"\n\nAt which point the lights came back on and I dove out of my bunk, gasping in fear and completely drenched in the terror sweats. The guy in the bunk above poked his head out of the curtains of his bunk and said \"Shut the fuck up Adddicus.\"\n\nYou may laugh now about this, I know I do, but for a brief time, I knew exactly how it felt to be buried alive, and it was far and away, the most, horrible, stark-raving mindless terror I have ever felt.",

It\u2019s not.  \nWhat actually happens is that after a minute or so of trying to hold your breathe under water, you can\u2019t do it, and you end up taking a breath anyway. When you do that, you inhale water. Even though your larynx might initially close, eventually water enters the lungs and the hearts will stop beating.  That\u2019s what kills you, not holding your breath. \n\nEdit: Clarified, meant holding your breath underwater, not suffocating - I understand that they're both death from suffocating, I just thought people held their breath until they passed out and died. The idea of being conscious and having one's body take a breath involuntarily is terrifying.",

The pitch &amp; roll really could get scary at times.  Sometimes, the waves would actually break over the bridge. If you had to get about in the ship during these times, you got real good at walking on the rolling bulkheads. Things would break free that were tied down &amp; you learned how to strap yourself into your rack to keep from flying out. The Navy frequently used frigates to give temporary rides to sailors transiting from other ships. Most often the submarine guys would get violently seasick in even the mildest of storms. They just weren't used to the rolling seas because normally their boat being under the surface would seek out a calm layer at deprh to cruise.",

That could have been disastrous. \n\nAnd that wasn't even the worst I saw. The South Atlantic has very few islands to break up the waves, so we saw some real monsters there. It's really weird when you walk on the deck, then onto the bulkhead on the left, back onto the deck, then onto the bulkhead on the right as the ship rolls.\n\nIt was also very cool to (if you timed it right) wait for the ship to hit the bottom of a trough, step through an open hatch and have the deck below rise up to meet you so that you only fall about a foot.",

I remember one morning after I ate breakfast I went up on the signal bridge, just to look out at the sea. There had been a storm the night before so the seas were still rough. A couple platoons of Marines were in ranks running for and aft on the forecastle below me. The ship was plowing through the waves, at about 20 knots, so there was a stiff breeze coming over the bow. One poor Marine, the very first guy in line did his best, but was unable to hack it, and just blew chunks straight ahead while standing at attention in formation. The wind took his... effluent, and whipped it down the entire length of his platoon sparking a massive chain reaction of vomiting. \n\nIt was horrific, and hysterical, but you do have to admire that first guy's discipline.",

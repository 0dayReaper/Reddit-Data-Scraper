                    "comment": "In the 18th century, the glass armonica fell out of favor amid fears that it had the power to drive the listener insane. At the time, German musicologist Friedrich Rochlitz strongly advised people to avoid playing it: \u201cThe armonica excessively stimulates the nerves, plunges the player into a nagging depression and hence into a dark and melancholy mood that is apt method for slow self-annihilation.\u201d\n\nIt is true that one of the early proponents of glass armonica music was Franz Anton Mesmer, whose eponymous practice of mesmerism is thought of as the forerunner of modern hypnotism. Mesmer used the unearthly quality of armonica music to its full advantage as a backdrop to his mesmerism shows, which eventually attracted some high-profile criticism.\n\nA 1784 investigation by some of the top scientific minds in France \u2013 including Franklin himself, concluded that Mesmer was a charlatan and that the music he used had only served to help him create an atmosphere that led people to believe his techniques were benefitting them when \u2013 in the eyes of the inquiry, at any rate \u2013 this was not the case.\n\nModern musicologists believe there is an explanation for why the strains of the glass armonica can have a disorientating quality. The instrument produces sounds at frequencies between 1,000 and 4,000 Hertz, approximately. At these frequencies, the human brain struggles to be able to pinpoint where the sound is coming from. This could explain why, for some people at least, listening to this music could be a disconcerting experience.",

                    "comment": "In the 18th century, the glass armonica fell out of favor amid fears that it had the power to drive the listener insane. At the time, German musicologist Friedrich Rochlitz strongly advised people to avoid playing it: \u201cThe armonica excessively stimulates the nerves, plunges the player into a nagging depression and hence into a dark and melancholy mood that is apt method for slow self-annihilation.\u201d\n\nIt is true that one of the early proponents of glass armonica music was Franz Anton Mesmer, whose eponymous practice of mesmerism is thought of as the forerunner of modern hypnotism. Mesmer used the unearthly quality of armonica music to its full advantage as a backdrop to his mesmerism shows, which eventually attracted some high-profile criticism. \n\n\nA 1784 investigation by some of the top scientific minds in France \u2013 including Franklin himself, concluded that Mesmer was a charlatan and that the music he used had only served to help him create an atmosphere that led people to believe his techniques were benefitting them when \u2013 in the eyes of the inquiry, at any rate \u2013 this was not the case.\n\n\nModern musicologists believe there is an explanation for why the strains of the glass armonica can have a disorientating quality. The instrument produces sounds at frequencies between 1,000 and 4,000 Hertz, approximately. At these frequencies, the human brain struggles to be able to pinpoint where the sound is coming from. This could explain why, for some people at least, listening to this music could be a disconcerting experience.",

Is it literally because your brain expects it to be a human voice and it turns out not to be?  If so, pretty much all music and plenty of other natural sounds also utilize this band, does the presence of a wider spectrum also being heard result in why this particular instrument is disorienting?\n\nEdit: also, 1e3-4e3 hz is a very slim bandwidth.  I feel like this instrument HAS to go well outside of that.  Thoughts?",

If you just have metallic lead, or lead oxide (the stuff in glassware), it's not really soluble in water and it's not very likely that significant quantities end inside your body.\n\nBut burning leaded gas produces lead bromide and lead chloride, both of which are dramatically more soluble in water than the metal and its oxide.\n\nThe water pipes in Flint, Mi had been made out of lead for a hundred years, but this didn't cause issues until the city administration wanted to cheap out on water by switching to sourcing water from the Flint river. But because that water was of much worse quality, with insufficient treatment and excessive amount of bacteria, they decided to add enough chlorine to the water to make it safe to drink. Except this also made it acidic enough that it started to leech significant quantity of lead into the water. Oops.",

There was also a child that died while at a concert featuring the instrument.  Theories ranged from believing it was lead poisoning from the glass to thinking the instrument's frequencies had a disorienting/sickening effect on the brain.  Some people even believed the instrument was summoning spirits.  \n\nThese theories have pretty much been debunked, and the rumors were probably inspired by the instrument's unsettling tone.

The instrument remained popular for a time but before amplification it was overpowered by the sounds over other instruments and fell out of favor.\n\nThe harmonica, although having a similar name, was not invented until about one hundred years later.\n\nFranklin was so enamored of the instrument that he allowed anyone to make it, and didn't want royalties.",

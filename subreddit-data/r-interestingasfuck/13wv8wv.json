                    "comment": "The effects of electricity can be difficult to predict in complex systems. You might have heard the saying the electricity follows the path of least resistance. That common saying isn\u2019t exactly correct. Electricity follows _all_ available paths to ground, but current flows inversely proportional to the resistance in a given path. \n\nWhat this means is that the electricity from a lightning strike is flowing through the entire car, but the majority of the current flows through the path with the least resistance. \n\nThe path with the lowest resistance is normally the thick, metal body of the car itself. Some current will inevitably branch out through the wiring in the car though, so a lightning strike can wreck a car\u2019s electrical systems. It\u2019s highly unpredictable though. A lot of it has to do with where the lightning enters and exits the vehicle.\n\nI once had a computer repair customer call me out to their home after a lightning strike. They had run an extension cord from their house out to a lighting fixture hung in a tree. Bad idea. \n\nLightning struck the fixture, ran down the extension cord to the outlet on the side of the house, which was wired through a junction box to a circuit in their family room. \n\nThe strike literally blew the cover off the outlet both inside and outside the house, turning everything weird colors with soot from vaporized material of various types. \n\nIt fried the computer that was plugged in to a surge protector on the same outlet, but the wild part was that some current flowed out through the computer\u2019s Ethernet port, fused the modular plug in the port, and fused the copper conductors to the modular plug on the modem side. I pulled the plug out of the DSL modem, and the copper conductors from the jack came with it. The modem was dead as well. They also lost a TV in an adjacent room. \n\nLightning is absolutely insane. If you had asked me what path it would have taken, I\u2019d have thought that it would hit the outlet on the outside of the house, chased the ground, and that\u2019s that. \n\nThat\u2019s the day I learned a valuable lesson about how electricity really works.",

It does it via the skin effect. As cars contain VERY large gaps, they don\u2019t really qualify as faraday cages in this case \u2014 but you still get the skin effect.",

A DC *spark* is more analogous to brief AC current in this particular case, because it grows quickly and then it diminishes. That allows the skin effect to take place in a metal cage with gaps too big to technically be a faraday cage, although the skin effect is generally an AC phenomenon.",

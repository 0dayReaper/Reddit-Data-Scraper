Effectively, he was filling the void left from their decomposed bodies. In many cases, their terror and anguish were evident, still etched across their faces. Wow!",

The ash, being so fine took very detailed inpressions of anyone buried in it when it solidified. Now Herculaneum is a different, often overlooked story. That city was at the base of the volcano. It got hit with a tidal wave of superheated pyroclastic debris. THEY got cooked, pompei got suffocated\n\nEdit: it is estimated that the city took hours, to be completely covered. Some tried to flee and got caught in the ash. Some tried to hunker down and wait it out but got buried alive in their homes. The lucky ones probably got crushed to death when their homes collapsed on them feom the weight of the ash",

There were injuries similar to those seen in the Herculaneum skeletons - flash burns, exploded skulls etc.!&lt;\n\nIt's likely that the Pompeii and Herculaneum deaths were quicker, simply because of the volume of material that was deposited on top (similar to what happened to San Miguel Los Lotes near Fuego, Guatemala in 2018).

What with climate change and AI, we will have to see if humans survive. Ironically it may not be hard AI that will make humans extinct - a truly sentient computer probably won't care that much about us and may not even want to wipe out humans. However a self-learning \"dumb\" AI may inadvertently wipe us out because it was just more convenient to reach its objective and not considering any consequences.",

The change is gradual increase by 3 months each year till 2030.  \n\n&gt;\tThe French government is changing the pension benefits to prevent the pensions system from falling into deficit and younger people carrying the burden\n1\n. The enacted pension reform aims to increase the employment rate of older workers by raising the minimum retirement age and accelerating the increase in the number of years of contributions required to receive a full pension\n2\n. The proposed changes include raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, which will be gradual, increasing by three months per year from September until 2030\n1\n3\n. The changes will boost the employment rate among 60-64 year-olds, which is just 33 percent in France\n\n&gt;\tThe French pension payments as a share of pre-retirement earnings are comfortably higher than elsewhere, and a French retiree's pension post-tax income comes in at nearly three-quarters of their pre-retirement earnings compared with 58% in Britain and nearly 53% in Germany, according to the OECD\n4\n. However, France spends nearly 14% of economic output on its pension system, which is nearly double the OECD average of 7.7%, with only Italy and Greece spending more than France\n4\n. The French pension system has one of the world's lowest retirement ages and highest spending, but such high spending helps keep France's poverty rate for retired people among the lowest in the developed world at only 4% of the population compared with an OECD average of 13% while inequality rates are also lower than average\n4\n.",

Do you think stopping production of new guns will matter?  Do you really think this country will repeal the right to own guns?  Good luck with that.  \n\nJust because AR15\u2019s look scary, does not mean they should be banned.

At the end of the day, I don\u2019t care what specific type of gun is being used, that\u2019s completely unacceptable in a modern, supposedly \u2018first world\u2019 country.\n\nI\u2019m glad you used the knife example in London because it\u2019s a perfect example of a government actually recognising where something is causing an issue and taking steps to regulate it. Seems you guys could learn from that.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I agree with you it\u2019s not as simple as \u2018ban all guns\u2019 - any person with a brain can see that\u2019s not feasible considering your relationship with them - but what, the solution is instead to do nothing? Seems fucking mad considering parents are resorting to sending their kids to school with bulletproof backpacks.\n\nSure, technically the guns themselves don\u2019t kill people. But don\u2019t try and tell me that you would see the same number of deaths if these low life\u2019s weren\u2019t able to access them so easily in the first place. The argument of \u2018oh, criminals will always find a way\u2019 doesn\u2019t hold up when the people doing the killing are for the most part still kids themselves - there\u2019s no way all these basement dwelling teens would be ringing up their black market dealers to find a gun.\n\nSo you can\u2019t argue that access to guns isn\u2019t the issue - it\u2019s no coincidence that a country with 300 million guns has by far the highest rate of gun deaths among the high income countries.",

The double wall layout gives strength to the wall crossection, wind pressure. Leaving the center space void of load bearing stone reduces the weight set upon the foundations, which are teetering on edge wiggle wiggle nudge nudge.\n\nAlso it wouldn't have been beyond the locals to place crossbeams inside the inner walls and build decks on those to support rooms. Enough time has passed to have those timbers rot away to nothing if the tower was vacated for long enough to let water do its work on the wood. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a mess of rotting beams on the ground level at some point of time.",

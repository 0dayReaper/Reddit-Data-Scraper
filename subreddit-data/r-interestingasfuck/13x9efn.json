NASA Researchers have experienced harassment for announcing a UAP research effort from the scientific community.\n4. NASA and AARO will work collectively.\n5. AARO briefed the [5 Eyes last week.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes)\n6. The most commonly reported shapes of UFOs according to the pentagon are orbs around 52% of sightings. Reported speeds of up to Mach 2 and no visible signs of propulsion.\n7. Disk, Saucers, Orbs, Cylinders, Tic Tacs are other reported shapes.\n8. NASA, AARO will use the Orb Video (in this post) to train AI used to Analyze Existing Video footage.\n9. NASA will discuss plans to build facilities to study UAP.\n10. NASA will try to crowd source data.\n11. FAA has no standardized reporting method for commercial pilots right now.\n12. FAA will begin using radar to detect UAP.\n13. NASA will use AI to analyze existing video footage with parameters of what is known and whatever is flagged as unknown will be further analyzed.\n14. Multi-sensor approach will be the foundation.\n15. The study of UAP is a high-impact scientific project for NASA.",

Because the public believes in UFOs and wants them to do this.\n2. Because it doesn't really matter if the reason why we put money into developing better sensors is to hunt for UFOs; the sensors can be used for all sorts of things: space missions in the case of NASA; airplane safety, for the FAA; surveillance, for the Navy's case.\n   1. Specifically from the Navy's perspective, they're basically getting to have a bunch of scientists improve their sensors for free.\n\nWhen the scientists say \"There is a need for higher quality data\", that's what they mean, they mean it literally, that's their motivation, they want higher quality data.",

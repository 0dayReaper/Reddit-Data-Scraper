You can be proud of someone, but Nazism and facism is often based on pride for oneself. The end result is heavy other-ing, constant competitiveness, and no sense of cooperation unless it's one of \"your\" kind.\n\nFunnily enough, this is one of the flaws that led to the doom of the Axis powers in WW2. They looked down upon each other behind their backs, and constantly withheld information because they didn't trust their allies with it. Meanwhile, the Allies (who also weren't exactly fond of each other), trusted (where it was needed) and cooperated with each other. Especially towards the end of the war. It was a huge benefit for them, and an advantage over the axis. \n\nAnd the thing with the axis is that if they coooperated with each other, they wouldn't be the axis. Their very ideologies were based on pride of themselves and everyone else being beneath them. It just isn't good unless you have overpowered military might.",

People sent their kids to private schools that could do whatever they wanted. There was a black boy in my kindergarten class for a couple months, and the school also had one Indian American girl. I sat with her at lunch because nobody else did. I can't imagine how lonely and awful her school experience was. I didn't have classes with her, and I just sat with her because she needed a friend. I wasn't really aware of her race until one of the teachers tried to stop me. The Indian family was neighbors with friends of my parents, and their daughters went to the same school as me. So that's how my parents learned there was issues. They just encouraged me to be friends with everyone and to not stop sitting with the girl. Honestly, I liked sitting with her because she had interesting food and liked trying my food. My family moved the next year, and there was one Chinese American boy at the small Christian school I attended. His parents ran the local Chinese restaurant. \n\nThere was a lot of South Korean boarding students in the two high schools I attended, but they were expected to assimilate quickly. Nobody ever talked about their race, and they weren't allowed to date outside of their race. They were a pretty insular group because of language barriers. I tried to get to know them, but they were younger than me and really quiet. When I was in college I'd volunteer to take them to the grocery store or Walmart or wherever when I was driving myself because I knew they'd never ask anyone for a ride. They really loved for me to drive around town and let them look at the architecture in town because it was so different from what they were used to. \n\nIn college there was a brother and sister who were mixed black and white, and they were made to pick which race they wanted to be considered at school. The girl went with white and her brother picked black, and the administration did feel their hair. I was so embarrassed. I didn't get choice of where to go to school, and because of my health problems, I couldn't just leave home and do what I wanted. I did speak out about racial issues along with a lot of other students, and the dating rules were finally abolished. One of the school's biggest financial supporters was racist as fuck. Once they died, the rules changed.\n\nWhole current generations went and are still going through school without learning about other cultures or knowing kids of other races. A lot of public schools are also still pretty much segregated because of school district gerrymandering. It's also possible to do online school even before Covid, so parents can keep their kids completely insulated from other races and cultures. \n\nI finished college in 2000. This racism and xenophobia isn't just in the history books. It's still happening. Trust me when I say that 99% of the kids I went to school with are raising their kids with the same awful beliefs.",

I had no idea what was going on, I ended up just thinking liking boys was bad and hid who I liked after that. She wouldn't even let me watch the fresh Prince of bel air. She was also mad that I made friends with the only none white kid in school. I chose my friends based on who was nice to me. I was badly bullied. She was really nice, we got along well, so we were friends. The only reason we stopped being friends was because she moved away and back in the late 90s there was no real way for kids to stay in contact.",

Nice people, but their religion is absolutely fucking whacky. They made multiple attempts to convert me, but I think they just kind of gave up when they realized that I'm...uhh, well...\"me\". An organization that believes all political activity is evil meets a socialist, shenanigans ensue\n\nI remember once she was explaining to me all the dos and don't of this religion (more \"don'ts\" then \"dos\", really). While she had a lot of faith in this stuff she also came off like she kind of resented a lot of the control it had over her. Like \"oh I was never allowed to date, I never had a Birthday party, we never celebrated Christmas, my parents \"vetted\" every friend I ever had before they let me hang out with them, but oh you know, it's for Jesus\". I think at one point I said something like \"You really think a bunch of guys in an office building upstate are the final authority on what god wants?\". She just straight up pretended I didn't say that.",

It was considered \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that white people were superior. They even taught that blacks people were literally animals prior to the early 20th century. So if people are taught this is in their formal education, why is this a surprise? As time passes people are going to forget how very real this stuff is because it just sounds so crazy and asinine *now* so people in the future (and many in current times) are going to assume people in the past had the same mindsets and that racism was a fringe concept. It wasn\u2019t. We have the problems be have today because racism was normal and considered moral and scientific. These pictures should not surprise anyone. Ten years prior to this pic, \u201cmodern people\u201d across the ocean in \u201ccivilized\u201d Europe were burning millions of humans in ovens and waged war with millions of others for their right to do so. People are never too \u201cadvanced\u201d to regress to this behaviors. Empathy, compassion and humanity have to be taught aggressively in schools at all levels, period.",

It was quiet, but broke thru all all other noise and was unmistakable... like a temple bell. Good way to get everyone's attention without going Sister Mary Elephant! \n \nEDIT: no I don't know what it's called or where to get it, but the internet probably does. It was a cylinder of metal maybe six inches long in a wooden cradle hung by two strings so it vibrated freely and came with a little metal mallet",

Even though blood between them is shared, they wouldn't have enough blood pressure going up into the head to keep the other head alive. At some point that's going to happen. \n\nIt gets worse though, each one of them only controls half the body. Even just walking requires a team effort. When one head dies, she'll effectively be wheelchair bound as she'll only be able to move half her body.",

Aged 62, Chang died in the night of bronchitus, and upon discovering this, Eng said that he would surely die very soon. Reportedly he died only two hours after Chang, though he was perfectly healthy. \n\nAn autopsy suggested that Eng died from blood loss as his system pumped blood uselessly through his dead brother.

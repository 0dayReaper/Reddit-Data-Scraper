The atmosphere was 2nd to none- the smell of Blockbusters in particular cling to my memory. Of course it also leads to reminiscing about Friday evenings watching movies and eating pizza with the family - and those memories are priceless. On a side note, I'm really curious to know if OP has a VHS copy of King of the Ring from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.",

Shittymorph's account was created 6 years ago. The writing style is VERY similar and they're the only two who, like the above commenter says, can fool people EVERY time with the EXACT same gimmick.\n\nThey've gotta be the same guy to my mind.\n\nEdit: Reading through both of their comment histories, I'm almost dead certain. There's unmistakable similarities about specific aspects of their writing. They both use hyphens for dramatic pause a lot, they both tend to use the Oxford comma where a lot of people wouldn't, and they both rely heavily on quotation marks, almost never paraphrasing. Grammar and punctuation are always college-essay perfect and never use things like ellipses or double exclamation points.\n\nThey also both always post in a single paragraph with no indentation or separation, which is honestly probably the most telling signature. A lot or most people on reddit will hit shift + enter to space out their paragraphs when telling a longer story. Morph and rogersimon basically never do (because it buries the twist in text and makes it much harder to detect it's one of theirs at a glance).\n\nu/shittymorph, anything you'd like to tell us?",

So many similar things - from the \"Big Shots\" and \"Adventures in Babysitting\" posters to the \"Adults Only\" section with the saloon doors. So much of this is spot-on, era-specific to the exact timeframe when I spent every day after school in a video store. (Only ours had fewer neon lights).\n\nBravo. (Also saw the #atl hashtag - you in Atlanta? Their stores were in Griffin and Fayetteville, incidentally.)",

I know if I follow something like that live I'll just be creating undue stress on myself when I have zero input on the outcome.  \"Wake up, do some chores spend some time on r/hfy and check on it when it's over.\"\n\nI know from past experience that I would have sat here, during the silent landing phase, with a racing heart. No idea why, something in human nature I guess. People at mission control must have felt like their hearts turned into jack hammers.",

What does it sound like when both speaker and listener are in a helium atmosphere? I've never seen that. \n\nWhat version does the NASA marketing dept think we want to hear?",

                            "comment": "Your comment made me wonder about the power source and I came across this, this is all so fascinating: \n\n&gt;Some NASA missions to Mars have run on solar energy, of course \u2014 the InSight lander currently operating on the Red Planet bears solar panels, as did the twin Spirit and Opportunity rovers earlier this century. But Opportunity is a mascot for the weaknesses of solar energy at Mars, since the rover's end came when a massive global dust storm blocked it from tapping into the sun's light. Run a rover on nuclear power and you don't have to worry about that scenario.\n\n&gt;So for the Perseverance rover, NASA turned to plutonium in a system called a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which should be able to power the spacecraft for about 14 years.\n\n&gt; You don't have extension cords, you can't run out for a repairman,\" Bob Wham, a nuclear fuel expert at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, said in the same podcast. \"You have to be totally reliable.\"\n\n&gt; Like the rest of the Perseverance rover, the MMRTG is based heavily on that of the Curiosity rover, which launched in 2011, landed on the Red Planet in 2012, and has been steadily chugging along ever since. Perseverance's MMRTG has been in the works for seven years, nearly as long as its predecessor has been powering Curiosity, and carries a price tag of $75 million, according to the DOE.\n\n\n&gt; Perseverance's MMRTG is designed to produce 110 watts of power, about the same as is used by a light bulb. The plutonium will decay, emitting heat that a generator converts into energy to power all of the rover's instruments, plus producing enough heat to protect the spacecraft from the freezing nights and winters on Mars.\n\n&gt; The plutonium began as a different element entirely, neptunium, which scientists irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for nearly two months to convert it to the plutonium form needed for the MMRTG. The plutonium is then combined with ceramic, making a safer compound than is used in weapons.\n\n&gt; Nevertheless, putting a nuclear power source at the tip of a rocket still prompts some cautionary measures. Most importantly, each pellet of plutonium is encased in iridium, which would contain the radioactive material if it fell back to Earth. According to NASA and the DOE, that's happened to space-bound nuclear power sources on three occasions, none of which caused any damage, with one of the power sources even being fished out of the ocean for later use on another mission.\n\n&gt; Unlike Curiosity's plutonium, some of that aboard Perseverance is relatively fresh and U.S.-made. The form of plutonium used on these missions began as a byproduct of nuclear weapon production processes, according to reporting by Slate after Curiosity's landing, and the U.S. government stopped creating its own supply of this plutonium in the 1980s, having decided it could access enough for its needs.\n\n&gt; But lately, NASA has been stuck rationing out the power sources, which is why the DOE decided in 2015 to get back in the business of making plutonium \u2014 up to 14 ounces (400 grams) each year right now, with an eye on being able to make 3.3 lbs. (1.5 kilograms) each year by 2026, according to the DOE.\n\n&gt; As to where that plutonium will go, one future nuclear-powered NASA mission is already in the works. The agency's Dragonfly mission, a drone bound for Saturn's strange large moon, Titan, will be powered by an MMRTG. That spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026.",

It's on a different part of mars that we could only land on with better landing technology; it's a crater that was full of water earlier in Martian history. Perseverance will be drilling for samples, packaging them up, and leaving them in specific locations for a future mission to come, pick up, and fly back to Earth. It also brought along a small drone that will be able to fly around to get a better view (and hopefully pave the way for future flying probes that'll be able to explore more of the planet).

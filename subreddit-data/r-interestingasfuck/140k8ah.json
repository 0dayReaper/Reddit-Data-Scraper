Therefore asking a wide audience to just 'look and draw conclusions' is not going to achieve much apart from lay people agreeing that yes, indeed, it **looks** like a wall.   \nWe have more experience with stone masonry than with geologic features.",

The fact people who study geology archeology mineralogy and even history can actively deny that technology in the past was more advanced literally blows my mind. \n\nEven as simple of an example as the Great pyramid of Giza.

I read the Turkish gov. Demolished the sites for some energy project. I can\u2019t recall this well so just my best recollection until I can get to the computer. Basically they were discovered but never excavated properly and destroyed under bizarre circumstances. I may have this very wrong so take with half a shaker a of salt.\n\nEdit: Also known as Beaded Field, Boncuklu Tarla was recently discovered to be at least 1,000 years older than Gobeklitepe in Mardin, Southeast Turkey.May 4, 2023\nTheTravel\n\nThese 16 Ancient Ruins Are The Oldest In The World - TheTravel\n\u2026 of this video, the Tas Tepeler Site of \u00c7akmaktepe - a direct pre-cursor to G\u00f6bekli Tepe, and it's also located close by, with origins 3-400 years older \u2026Dec 16, 2022\nThe Archaeologist",

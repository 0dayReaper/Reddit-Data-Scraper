Under his orders, millions of members of a religious minority in Xinjiang are being held in concentration camps, subject to torture, murder, re-education, and purposeful erasure of their culture and their numbers. Under his orders, Chinese dissenters and political activists are denied their god-given right to free expression, and kidnapped, imprisoned, tortured and killed for their work. Under his orders, **Christians are denied their freedom to worship** how they wish. Under his orders, a horrifying social credit system enforces a nightmarish scheme of social control, stripping Chinese citizens of their rights for acting or speaking against the interests and viewpoints of the government. The government of China is the greatest enemy of freedom that the world currently faces; and its human rights record ranks as abysmally low as those of the worst regimes of the 20th century. **Four thousand years of totalitarian rule** in China continues under the communist party; and until the party is stripped of power and the Chinese people are liberated, the world cannot call itself free.\n\nThe free countries of the world must cease their support of Chinese government organs like Huawei. Move factories and supply chains out of China. Deny them access to our intellectual property. Shut them out of the world economic system. They cannot be tolerated...",

One religion should not be made more important than the other. One religion should not make the situation more dire than another. Playing favorites with religion is part of the same mindsets that lead to the injustices you\u2019re speaking out against. Practice what you practice and let others practice what they practice. But don\u2019t insinuate one religion is more important than others or that because it\u2019s a more westernized religion that it might resonate more with western people. There are many paths to the same goal.",

Hong Kong tried to take the person back to Taiwan for his offense to be charged there, but Taiwan was not in Hong Kong's list of countries that are able to do that.\n\nNormally Hong Kong will just add Taiwan to the list and get the criminal to Taiwan but the government, which is pro-Chinese, wanted to update the law so that China can now get people in Hong Kong without political reasons too. Hong Kongers were terrified and think this will provide the opportunity for China to prosecute people opposing them in Hong Kong, which is a place with freedom of speech, and thought that it was a major threat to them and a break of the 50-year promise ( one country two system) set in 1997. Therefore, they went on the streets to speak for the cancellation of the discussion of this new law. \n\nForgive my limited English.\n\nI saw someone wanting a subreddit dedicated to politics in Asia and I thought it is a good idea so here it is r/AsianPolitics let's see how it goes",

[here is the response, available in english.](https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201906/09/P2019060900587.htm?fontSize=1) \n\nthere have also been controversy that the government, or some other organization in favor of the central government, were trying to stir up even more confusion and controversy by staging anti-police attacks with gasoline bombs, and there were also rumors that certain individuals were called/recruited to cause chaos within the protestors during the march today.        \n\nthe chief executive of hong kong, carrie lam, made absolutely no response to the protests even after being asked about it. she just smiled and kept quiet. later on in the night, riot police rushed in and chased protestors away. reporters were also chased away. \n\nprior to the 2019 protest was another mass protest against article 23, which threatened hong kong's autonomy. the protest had half a million participants, and successfully made the government revoke the article. however, both the hong kong govt and the CPC govt have taken tougher stances since the 2014, 2003 protests, which actually achieved effect in revoking laws. perhaps the governments won't be easily swayed this time.

The role of the justice system is to serve the Communist Party. \n\nThe Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court publicly proclaimed the Court's role was to obey the Party:\n\n*\"China's courts must firmly resist the western idea of \u201cconstitutional democracy\u201d, \u201cseparation of powers\u201d and \u201cjudicial independence\u201d. These are erroneous western notions that threaten the leadership of the ruling Communist Party... We have to raise our flag and show our sword to struggle against such thoughts.\"*\n\nThis is akin to John Roberts saying *\"my role is to follow the leadership of the Republican Party and to be resolutely loyal to the Donald Trump Thought.\"*\n\nThe HK government is trying to allow such a judicial paragon to extradite anyone from HK for \"trial\" in China.\n\nTo see how bad this is going to be just look at the disastrous case of [Causeway Bay Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Causeway Bay Books is a bookstore in HK that sells books that are banned in China. People who worked there were **kidnapped in Hong Kong by the Chinese Government and secretly shipped to China for incarceration.** The Chinese wanted to know who from China had bought banned books from the bookstore. Hence the kidnapping. The manager of the bookstore was locked up in China for months and was only allowed back to Hong Kong on the promise he would retrieve a customer list from a hard drive in HK and give it to China. He reneged on his promise once he crossed the border and hold a press conference instead. Now he's in exile in Taiwan.\n\nThis kind of fascist regime is what HK government is proposing to extradite its own people to.",

So for the people of Hong Kong, this issue has only become more prominent over time.",

This has been a noteworthy trend in the city. Hong Kong has been the financial gateway to East Asia for some time now, but the Mainland has been pouring money into Shanghai to supplant HK. Meanwhile, Chinese SOEs in finance have been taking over the industry in HK, making mandarin more of the language of business and increasing dependence on the mainland. On one hand, this simply fits with the broader trend of China's economic ascendancy; on the other hand, it's been carried out purposefully.",

What they commonly say as a counter argument would be \n1) Hong Kong won't even have water without China (we pay massive amount of money for that sh*t water we can't refuse) \n2) Hong Kong people just feel superior because they were part of the western world and want to keep being part of the west (yeah right totally not because the Chinese government is terrifying), \n3) (about Tiananmen square massacre) yeah I guess it is emotionally important to HK and Taiwan but not to us Chinese people (wtf you should care it literally happened to highly educated college students like you), and \n4) why can't they just follow the rules of the Chinese government?\n\nTo be clear, outside of any political topics, I am close friends with them and they are nice people. Chinese government is so good at giving biased and untrue information to their future generations.\n\nEdit: To add...the water HK buy from China is so contaminated that it costs more to treat that water than just treat sea water to fresh water, which HK has tons of. But HK is stuck with buying that China water. I will need to find sources for this but it was in HK news ~10 years ago or so.",

One time I posted a video about the Causeway Bay Books disappearances on social media, one of them commented \"I am not trying to defend for my government. But if you read the news you will notice that there is no solid evidence indicate that the concerned party set a trick to him and took him. I feel like as a scientist we should not urge to make a statement until we get good evidence.\" (They said scientist because we are in a STEM program)\nSo...yeah. I do struggle a lot with how to have a conversation about politics with people having opposite views. I am not sure how much they know about Tiananmen square massacre so I can't comment on if they are ok with the government killing students, especially one time I said something along the lines of \"the Chinese government is evil\" and one of them immediately responded nervously \"no don't say that be careful\". We are in the US at that time. I think none of them have ever looked up the event other than  \"official\" sources because some of them KNEW they will get in trouble. The biggest reason that I want to stay friends with them is that they are the victims as well. They are smart people who (knowingly and unknowingly) got trapped in this mess and can never get out. I really want to better inform them without having a fight, so that's where I am at learning how to have a convetsation about politics.",

We are part of China, but with the Special Administrative Region status, which *was supposed to* promise \"One country, two systems\", Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong and high degree of autonomy until year 2047. (Keywords: *was supposed to*.) We have a different government system, education system, and judicial system as well as different language and culture. We don't push up property prices of other places to insane levels by mass buying properties, but are the victim of mainland Chinese investors doing so. We can access Whatsapp, Facebook, Insta, Reddit etc without VPN.\n\n&gt;Why would the government push such a law that only undermines Hong Kong?\n\nUnfortunately, In spite of those governmental differences I just described, the HK government is just a sock puppet working for China. We can't choose our own Chief Executive, and even our people-elected legislative council members can get kicked out simply because the Chinese government says so - shortly after the last legislative council elections, the Chinese government suddenly \"clarified\" a law that LegCo members need to prove their loyalty to China and kicked out 5 elected members. (Our constitutional document, Basic Law, gives the Chinese government supreme authority on clarifying HK laws when needed, but this is the first time such \"clarification\" happened without HK government seeking clarification in the first place, the also the first time this is used aggressively for political purposes. There will definitely be more to come.)\n\n&gt;That's sad, hope you people together can fight for independence.\n\nNope. Not happening. Extremely unrealistic in both strength and sustainability. Personally I don't see any kind of hope here and hoping for a chance for emigration so I can gtfo of this cursed place asap.\n\n&gt;Did you join the demonstration?\n\nYes.\n\n&gt;Tanks lol xddddd\n\nNope. Not funny. As I said before Hong Kong is not fully the same as China.\n\nIt's nearly 4 AM now, I need to sleep.",

However this time it might not be the case, as the central government is tightening up.",

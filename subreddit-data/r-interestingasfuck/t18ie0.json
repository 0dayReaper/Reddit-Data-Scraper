It would take a LOT of change and a LOT of response to get Putin's attention.    We also  misinterpret the affect resistance has on Putin's plans.   He's ruthless but unbothered.  He'll happily hunt a single resister down and torture them and  their family because they did and he can.   He's fine with a gulag or slave labor or warming up one of his crematorium for that purpose, too, btw.   He's not worried about street cred or de lining public opinion.    He has the power and the peons don't matter.   He's out here for land, revenge and profit.  These resisters will have to come for those items before he's going to take them as a serious threat to his plans.  Right now they're an entertaining diversion. \n\nThere's a saying that applies to every side of this circle.  Why boil water if you're don't want tea?    Who wants tea? How badly?  Do they have firewood?   We are really gonna have to want that tea to boil enough water to end this situation for once and all and Putin is drinking vodka, sooo...",

Large reason why putin got so much power is that Russian people are extremely apathetic politically, you guys probably can't even imagine, really I don't even think that ll the election machinations are about helping him win (he has no competitors on the ballot) as much as they are about hiding how few people actually turn up to vote. Younger generation isn't as complacent, but most people simply remember how much worse things were in the 90's that they aren't willing to fight for anything better (can't imagine how heartbreaking it must have felt to be an idealistic anti communist back in the day). But now the prices at the stores are beginning to skyrocket and soon people will start losing jobs with more coming as economy gets worse. It's a shame that economic crisis may be the only thing that can force majority to actually do something but I suppose it's better than waiting until the younger and less apathetic youths become the majority",

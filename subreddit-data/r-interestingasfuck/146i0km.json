All of those buses belonged to the Hog Farm, hired by producers to provide a \"Peace Force\" for the event, and responsible as it turned out for much of the best work in helping everybody cope with a major logistical disaster. The guy wearing  big sombrero and riding a small tractor is Hugh Romney, aka Wavy Gravy. You can get the best overview of how this all transpired by watching the documentary made a few years ago by PBS (NOT the \"official\" documentary released in the70s.) Another good source is the Museum at Bethel Woods, which sits on the old festival site and is a repository of all things Woodstock.",

But for us younger folks, we still don\u2019t have money so we\u2019re (on average) staying liberal even though the oldest Millenial age is 42. That seems to me the most logical conclusion after wondering the same thing for many years.",

Me and Tonya may not agree but we talk about it, when necessary seek compromise. Respectful of each other and willing to listen. Instead it all has turned into a cult where even minor disagreements are met with accusations and protests. No wonder we can\u2019t even get the big things right when everyone demands 100% acceptance of an idea and respect while refusing to give respect. Gotta fix it soon or it\u2019ll get ugly.",

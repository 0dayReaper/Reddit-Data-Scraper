The alien conspiracy theorists allege that there is an alien species that they refer to as the grays who have been visiting Earth for millenia and actively meddle in human affairs. They allege that the grays can communicate telepathically with humans and possibly control minds. It's not the government that is behind the cover ups. They allege tha it is the aliens themselves who use their superior intellect and technology to keep themselves hidden from humans save for a select few that they've contacted.\n\n&gt;Even true believers have to admit that the likelihood of an alien spaceship coverup decreases every passing year. As more and more people are cycled out of the government positions that would be responsible for maintaining the coverup. And as they cycle out, get old and die, now of them never manage to properly spill the beans in a way that could be proven.\n\nI disagree. Every passing year would make a cover up easier. As people \"in the know\" die they are no longer able to spill the beans about what they know. As recovered material is reverse engineered the original material is no longer interesting. One of the things that alien believers allege was recovered was fiber optic cables. Fiber optic cables would have been evidence of technology beyond anything human in 1947, but today it's not even special.\n\nIf an alien spacecraft crashed in 1947 it would be way easier to keep it secret today than in 1947 because the people who were there are now dead and the physical evidence lost to time. No different than how it's easier to cover up a crime if it takes 20 years before an investigation starts. The evidence is simply long gone.\n\nNot saying I believe all that, but that's how alien conspiracy theorists would explain how the government managed to stay tight lipped for 75 years. They are basically just sock puppets for beings that are far more intelligent than humans.",

No death bed confessions. No government department studying the alien craft or trying to make contact, which would require bringing in new people periodically, and certainly needs funding.\n\nThey have to have seen the most amazing, most meaningful discovery in all of human history, without exception. And decided it was best to bury it forever. Hide/destroy all evidence of it, not share it with anyone, pretend it never happened.\n\nIt just makes so littler sense. And it is so contrary to how humans and government actually work. The US could not even keep atomic secrets under wraps without it leaking to Russia and other countries. They have gone through many public data leaks, and I'm sure many private ones.",

It's a shame that this is still necessary and yet it is clear that it is.",

Her right to exist, wearing whatever she wants on her head is NO business of his and her right to be left alone far outweighs his need too express his cruelty. \n\nWhat makes this worse is that he probably did this fully expecting there to be no recourse. What a despicable, remorseless coward. He, and anyone who has landed on the side of this bully might want to seek help to see what happened to their empathy.  It will eventually be a problem. \n\nThis guy is having to learn this the hard way and is now out of a job. He should have been caught early and now he has had to learn at a time in his life when the stakes are very high.",

It\u2019s treatable, but where it\u2019s still relatively rampant, people sometimes avoid seeking treatment due to the taboos around people with leprosy, and end up losing sensation in their extremities and hurting themselves and ending up with these wounds. I also learned a theory in a medical anthropology class that modern strains of leprosy may be less virulent than past strains, which is why it\u2019s actually pretty tough to contract now.",

Media around leprosy tends to dwell on the sensationalistic images of people with missing parts and in abject poverty, rather than on the fact that it\u2019s treatable and the WHO provides the antibiotics for free. Nobody should suffer or die from leprosy in this century, and yet too many do. (A refrain that can be sung for many, many diseases\u2026)",

It had a large wheel in front, a blade to tear up the soil and two handles to push it.  One day it was super hot and my mom faltered while using it.  There was a loud snarl, like leather ripping and the next thing I know my mom is getting up off the ground with a deep slash that ran the length of her thigh. There was little blood for such a huge wound. She was in a borderline panic, trying not to traumatize us, and keep herself calm enough to reach help as she drove herself to hospital. To this day, when I think about the event, I swear I can still hear the sound of the blade's bite.",

No pain, no blood gushing out because none of my arteries were cut.\n\nI was about 10 yards away from my home and I ran back home, similar to what you see the guy is doing in the video.\n\nMy dad bandaged the wound the best he could and took me to the ER.  I was in shock for 30 mins. and another 30 mins. while waiting in the ER. Blood started pooling inside my wound but I didn't feel any pain during the 1st hour until the ER doctor gave me local anesthesia using a MFing 6\" long needle.  That hurt to the point where I wanted to be knocked out.\n\nWalked out with 24 stitches and a splint for my leg.",

I have sustained deep cuts to almost every body part and the ones the bleed the most are basically areas that have a lot of sensitivity, or thin skin, like your hands, feet, wrists/ankles and head/face. We don't need highly refined touch receptors on our limbs so cuts have to go rather deep to reach major blood vessels.\n\nFor example, I cut my shin (6\" cut) right down to the bone (which looks yellow btw) and it bled less than any cut on my hand ever has. Humans wouldn't have survived very long as a species if superficial cuts to our legs or arms caused us to bleed out, those blood vessels tend to be rather deep and rather large.",

Lienen ran to the sidelines with the gaping wound to confront Otto Rehhagel, who was the coach of Werder Bremen at the time. Lienen blamed Rehhagel for the foul, claiming that he instigated Siegmann to commit the tackle. The wound was stitched with 23 stitches, and Lienen resumed training after 17 days. In a 2012 interview, Lienen downplayed the incident, stating that although the injury looked serious, it was actually harmless. He admitted that his confrontation with Rehhagel was merely an impulsive reaction.\n\nmachine translated",

Considering he was bleeding very little, if at all from such a big wound it is likely that only his skin and some connective tissue was hurt which will heal very fast and hurt and bleed very little. \n\nSo 5cm certainly is a deep wound just looking at the numbers, but since nothing that was lying that deep was actually damaged it's more like opening a zipper and looking inside of an intact bag, rather than ripping it open and spilling what's inside.\nOne is very much messy and needs attention and care to return back to normal, while the other just kinda closes again and everything's fine.",

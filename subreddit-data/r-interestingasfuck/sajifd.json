It's heartbreaking, eye opening, and anyone who cares about the ocean, and animals in captivity when they SHOULDN'T BE ought to watch it. I've seen it a dozen times at least. \n\nI grew up on Vancouver Island, and I've seen pods of wild orca in the straights of the ocean that surrounded my home. Tilikum was first harboured in Victoria, then moved to Vancouver, I've seen him at the aquarium, I've seen his shows as a child, he is not a happy healthy orca, he is 100% living in a hellscape for entertainment and profit. These poor creatures need to stop being put on display for crowds.\n\nEdit, Tilikum passed away in 2017. You can sometimes find Blackfish on Netflix, or rent it on YouTube!",

They knew he was dangerous and put them in the water with him anyway.  The trainers were also kept at part time and weren't getting benefits or proper pay.

Inconsistent reward messes with the brain and because we don't know exactly what we're doing to get the reward, we try harder, and ignore damaging behaviour back at us because it's probably our fault that we don't understand the system.\n\nMy hunch is that it's the exact same pattern as you seen in abused spouses who refuse to leave their partner because they \"love\" them.",

Sea World had to drill out each damaged tooth, basically multiple root canals without anesthetic, of course, because there is no safe way to anesthetize an Orca. And then, because there is also no safe way to fill, cap or crown the voids, they had to train the orcas to hold still and let the trainers power wash the drilled out teeth as part of their daily routine. \n\nNobody else has these specific behavioral issues with their animals. \n\nTilikum was probably something similar to psychotic. He had little to no social interaction with other whales compared to what wild orcas experience. He was moved multiple times, so whatever bonds he formed with his own kind were regularly interrupted. Staff turnover meant he had different trainers, so even *those* bonds were transitory, and wild orcas rarely ever leave their pods. So he was severely damaged and stunted socially. There's absolutely no way his needs for physical exercise were ever met, given that wild orcas travel for miles every day. He was essentially kept in a very small, hard box with no reasonable social interaction. Shows and the damn tooth treatment were the only things he could regularly expect. And then he killed Dawn and they took the shows and the other whales away from him, and he spent his last years in an isolation tank because he was too fucking dangerous to train or allow around the other whales. There is zero chance that animal was anything approaching sane. And given that these are highly sapient animals with an emotional processing center larger than our entire brain, that statement ought to be criminal.",

Reports indicated it was the often bullied male which was Tillikum. Despite efforts to save her the whales played with her until she died. \n\nOn July 6, 1999, a 27-year-old man, Daniel P. Dukes, was found dead over Tilikum's back in his sleeping pool. Dukes had visited SeaWorld the previous day, stayed after the park closed, and evaded security to enter the tank unclothed. An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and his genitals had been bitten off, all allegedly caused by Tilikum. Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured. The autopsy concluded that Dukes' cause of death was drowning. The medical examiner reports that no drugs or alcohol were found in Dukes' system.",

The three whales submerged her, dragging her around the pool and preventing her from surfacing. At one point, she reached the side and tried to climb out, but the whales pulled her back into the pool. Other trainers threw her a life-ring, but the animals kept her away from it, ignoring the trainer's recall commands. She surfaced three times before drowning, and it was several hours before her body could be recovered from the pool. Tilikum was moved to SeaWorld Orlando on January 9, 1992. Sealand of the Pacific closed soon afterward.\"\n\nSecond kill:\n\n\"On July 6, 1999, a 27-year-old man, Daniel P. Dukes, was found dead over Tilikum's back in his sleeping pool. Dukes had visited SeaWorld the previous day, stayed after the park closed, and evaded security to enter the tank unclothed. An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and his genitals had been bitten off, all allegedly caused by Tilikum. Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured. The autopsy concluded that Dukes' cause of death was drowning. The medical examiner reports that no drugs or alcohol were found in Dukes' system.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy far the most deadly Orca ever in captivity. The biggest orca in captivity. Very angry\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention he was used as a breeding bull and sired over 20 pups 9 of which are still alive.",

Actually the whole family was traumatized as they made eye contact with Dawn when she managed to temporarily escape the orca's grasp. The orca actually grabbed her by her ponytail then ravaged her relentlessly. It took staff 30 minutes to remove her from the orca's grasp. When the family went to the lobby they were met by a staff that was dismissive to their plight. Seaworld not only fought the family in court they appealed the fines levied by OSHA.\n\nApparently a training technique is to deny the orcas food if they don't perform properly!!! Tillikum was torn away from his mother when he was 2 years old. He was forced to share a tank with 2 adult females who battered him frequently. He killed a trainer at the first Aquarium he \"lived\" in. At this park these were HUNDREDS of reports of aggression by the orcas in the previous decades. Really? Whodathunkit?",

An autopsy found numerous wounds, contusions, and abrasions covering his body, and his genitals had been bitten off, all allegedly caused by Tilikum. Despite numerous cameras around and inside the pool that are supposed to monitor the well-being of the whales, SeaWorld claims the event was not captured. The autopsy concluded that Dukes' cause of death was drowning. The medical examiner reports that no drugs or alcohol were found in Dukes' system.\n\nSo specifically the dumbass was Daniel P. Dukes",

The water here only exaggerates things a little bit - his pecs were so massive multiple people could lie across them. Pectoral fins the length and breadth of a king size mattress. From rostrum to tail he was probably the length of a school bus at least. He was an awesome creature and Blackfish broke my heart all the more because I knew it was about an animal I had personally come across in my lifetime and seen with my own eyes. I think what we run into with cetaceans in captivity is a really keen glimpse into some of our own mental health problems as humans living, more or less, self-domesticated lives.",

He was not elderly. I don't have proof but I've always felt they were just waiting for him to die off now that he'd \"caused\" them so much trouble and they were forced to stop breeding orcas. \\[edit: should add that before this Tilikum was their star sire, they sold his genetic material to other aquariums at top dollar, and a good number of the captive bred orca population can trace their ancestry back to him\\]\n\nHe is the most well known example of a much larger problem with keeping cetaceans captive. They are up there with large parrots in terms of extremely intelligent and long-lived creatures who need more enrichment than humans are really equipped to give within the bounds of captivity. Even the best aquarium in the world isn't big enough for an orca to roam free and be an orca.",

He then wandered around the park and entered the back area of the whale enclosures. There are locks on all the gates so he had to have climbed over which really isn't a big deal. No one knows why he chose to walk over to Tili's pool but he did obviously. It isn't pitch dark over there but the lights are dimmed. \n\nIt isn't known if the guy died from hypothermia or drowning but he *was* found the next morning by a trainer. The guy was missing his genitals. My guess is that Tili had the guy in his mouth and when the guy tried to escape, all of those sharp teeth sliced the guy's junk off. He might have already drowned at that point because as we know, Orcas like to take people down to the bottom of the pool.",

My response was always \" You can't kill an idea.\" This is not something you \"win\".  You can kill as many people as you want but this enemy isn't something that's really tangible. The Taliban, ISIS whatever. They are ideologies. Shit we wiped the floor with Germany in WW2 and there is still NAZI's today. We never went into Afghanistan to flatten the country at all. We tried the hearts and minds thing (mostly). Could we have \"won\". Sure but you have to make sure you understand the definition of what you consider \"winning\" is.  We absolutely could have murdered basically the entire population and enslaved who ever we didn't. Would have made us terrible human beings and 10x worse than the enemy we went to fight in the first place but we certainly had the technology/weapons and man power to do it.  War today is complex. Way more so than 1939 to 1945. Back then there was a clearly defined good vs evil with clearly defined goals.  Sorry didn't meant to write a wall of info here but i seen your post and its so rare and refreshing to find someone who understands.",

She said so seriously... \"Turn on the News.\" We all stopped talking immediately, our teacher stood  up at his desk, and fumble the remote for a second, like it was an alien in his hand. We turned to the TV, first channel it's already on is live reporting... There's the first tower with smoke. The girl three chairs behind me starts crying, and proceeds to start having a panic attack. She just moved to here (The South) from New York. The teacher from next door beckons her, and they leave for what I now assume was the counselors office. I turn back the tv, and no one knows what's really happening. The news is chaotic, everyone is whispering among themselves, and everyone is trying to watch the news, listen, and talk all at once. Then it happens...\n\nWe all sit there in school, and watch on live television, and the second plane crashes into the other tower. We all go silent, we don't know what just happened... We do, but we don't really. I feel like all of us went through the rest of that day like ghosts. Kids were being pulled from school left and right. It was the longest, quietest, day in high school, I ever remember.\n\nEdit: Thank you ALL for sharing your memories as well... It's been surreal to read through so many people feeling the exact same as myself. It's hard to remember sometimes, we were all there, we ALL experienced this together.  It's almost an eerie feeling. Also, thank you stranger for my award.",

Before the bell rang for class to begin, I was in my coaches classroom across the hall from my English class.  I was getting a book cover because we had to wrap our textbooks with one.  He had the TV on and I remember seeing the tower with smoke coming from it.  They said a plane had hit it.  I was thinking like a kitty Cessna prop plane or something.  \n\nA few minutes later as we were in class my teacher put on the news.  We saw the second one hit, and it was surreal.  It was clear it was an attack.  My friend who was in class with me didn\u2019t know it at the time, but his uncle was one of the firemen who was in the building when it collapsed.  We (he) literally watched the death of his uncle on live television.  It was a horrible day.",

I was a middle schooler, home schooled, my mom and I were just about to start the school day when a neighbor called and told us to turn on the news.\n\nWe tuned in just in time to see the second strike.  It didn\u2019t feel real. Like you we were thinking the first plane was some little puddle jumper cesna. To see this massive jumbo jet ram a building like a ballistic missile, it just didn\u2019t feel real.

About 20 or so minutes after the second plane hit my mom and I heard this deafening roar that shook the entire house.\n\nTurned out it was the first of many pairs of F-18s scrambled to patrol the skies overhead.  We lived in Dallas at the time and there was big concern that any other major city could be next, so the local airbase had fighters patrolling the sky afterward. They flew so low ( I assume to avoid showing up on potential enemy radar) that every time they passed by the house would tremble. They moved so fast that the tremble would come first and we\u2019d hear the roar of the engines as a sort of aftershock to their passing by.",

The first tower was hit before school and I just remember my dad crying. The second tower was hit while I was at school and we watched the news for the remainder of the day. I don\u2019t think I really understood what had happened until a few years later while I was watching a documentary in my freshman history class and that included a 5 minute stretch of film from inside the lobby of one of the towers after people had started jumping. You could hear them when they landed, and i don\u2019t know why but I absolutely broke. At that point I was old enough to really empathize and it was the first time I had seen actual footage like that of it. I would have appreciated a little warning from my teacher that this type of content was included. Just awful.",

I still remember watching the first tower collapse, and hearing one of my classmates ask the teacher if everyone got out okay.",

I left to go watch TV with my brother and as I walked out, the phone rang and it was my dad telling my mom to go get the kids away from the TV because something was very wrong. She came into the TV room just as the second plane hit and the three of us just stood there completely shocked at what we had just seen. What gets me emotional every anniversary is remembering my brother, who would have been 6 or 7 look at my mom and go \u201cmummy were there people in that plane?\u201d And then my poor mum, who was just as confused as us, had to sit down and explain to us that some people are horrible as we all watched the towers crumble.",

Remember a teacher running into the room and rushing to turn on the TV while we were in session. Legitimately just sat there for the first 30sec wondering if this was some movie or something and clearly it wasn\u2019t. That day in school was surreal. We all just grouped up in classrooms and watched the news, didn\u2019t do any work really but we stayed the whole day. Teachers were great though, I remember all of them asking us how we were and if we needed to talk/etc. One of those days you won\u2019t forget where you were at.",

At that moment, it felt like anything might happen next. \n\nWe didn\u2019t know how many planes there were, who was doing it, what they were trying to accomplish, or why. We didn\u2019t know if there might be hundreds of planes/missiles or whatever. Since we didn\u2019t know these things, we wondered if our city was safe.\n\nWhen the first tower fell, most of the people around me watching it happen but could not comprehend it. After a few seconds, I blurted out: \u201cIts gone!\u201d.  Two people disagreed, said \u201cno, its just behind the other tower\u201d. \n\nWhen the second tower collapsed, I remember the look of horror on the faces around me. One of them, from New York, walked away, unable to watch anymore.\n\nThe anthrax letters came like a couple of days later. This made me wonder \u201cwhat is next?\u201d. It was all so unpredictable and confusing.\n\nI remember making contingency plans with family on the 11th and 12th to evacuate the United States. We felt like there would soon be military checkpoints at major intersections, and we wanted to get ahead of that, before road travel became restricted.\n\nA friend who was planning to visit from Canada in a few weeks called to cancel on the 12th or 13th, saying they didn\u2019t want to come if there was going to be a war inside the United States.\n\nThis may sound insane, but keep in mind we didn\u2019t know for the first few days who was doing this, why, or what they may do next.",

A few hours later the administration is going from classroom to classroom all day long, telling the teachers to turn off the TV and do school stuff. The TV would be turned off and go back on a minute later; one of the teachers said something along the lines of \"when I was a kid we watched TV after JFK was shot. this is your generational moment.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe really funny thing from school that day was some of the students freaking out, thinking that the terrorists were coming for our high school next. Because after the WTC and Pentagon were attacked, their next target would obviously be a small high school hundreds of miles away. The admin addressed this concern by having our middle-aged morbidly obese janitor/handyman sit on a chair outside of the locked school doors with a baseball bat.",

We turned on a tv and saw the 2nd plane hit. My co-workers and I were sobbing.\n\nWhen the plane hit near Pittsburgh, 40 miles from our home, I grabbed my kids out of school and went home. I sat in front of the TV crying all day and into the night.\n\nThe horror of watching people jumping to their death! Can you imagine having to pick your death? Death by burning or death by jumping 90 floors.\n\nCan you imagine being in an airplane with your child, seeing that you are being flown into a building or the Earth?\n\nThe Pentagon was hit. Multiple rumors were flying on the radio that there were car bombs throughout D.C. Other rumors were that bridges had bombs under them.\n\nWe were under attack and our aggressors were unknown at that point.\n\nI did not work the next day but thought it wise to gas up my car. I went to the station and there was a huge line. Some kid was playing \"It's the End of the World\" over and over.",

A few of my classmates had parents who worked in NYC and one even had a parent who worked in the World Trade Center. \n\nI was in Mr. Ford\u2019s 4 period band class when another teacher Ms Thiel came in to tell Adam his father was ok and made it out. She said it out loud to the class and everyone looked at her confused. She looked to Mr. Ford and simply said \u201cthey don\u2019t know?\u201d and he simply shook his head. Ms. Thiel took Adam out into the hallway, there was some quiet conversation among the students some of thought maybe Adam\u2019s dad had surgery\u2026then Adam came back in less than a minute.\n\nClass ended I caught Adam in the hallway. He made it sound like a plane had flown into the World Trade Center but from how he said it - the way I remember in my head - gave me the impression it was like a private jet with a drunk pilot hitting the building.\n\nI had another class then lunch half of which was eating the other half was running around outside. At the time my older brother was fresh out of college and working as a substitute teacher in the middle school. He found me outside and pulled me away from playing with my friends. He told me look at the sky, what do you notice that\u2019s different? I thought this was like a joke or a trick question. He then said \u201cyou notice how there\u2019s no planes in the air?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I learned about 9/11. My dad was a firefighter and went to ground zero the next day to help. He took pics on a disposable camera when he went so if anyone is interested in seeing those pics let me know and I\u2019ll post them later.\n\n*edit: seems like some people wanted to see the photos, [here you go](https://m.imgur.com/a/ij8x7)",

            "comment": "Today is my birthday and I turned 18 in 2001. I was in my first year of college, studying graphic design and living on campus. I had reading comprehension class at 9 and wasn\u2019t aware anything had happened until I encountered some commotion while walking across campus. I was passing another residence hall when a (white) dude came out and started pointing at another student (who was likely Indian) and said, \u201cyour people bombed our country!\u201d I was stunned in place for a moment, thinking WTF, leave that poor kid alone! I will never forget the look of fear on his face and could just see the blood drain from him as he was as clueless as I was in that moment. I got to class along with other pockets of students out that typical Tuesday, some coming from the dining hall etc. When I got to my class, not many people were there because our teacher was explaining there was a national emergency and turning people away at the door. A few students stood and watched the tv that was mounted on the wall. They had cancelled all classes for that day immediately. I went back to my dorm. The entire country was halted. Flights grounded. Everyone was told to go home and check in with family etc. I got back to my room in time to settle in for the second plane to hit. The entire nation watched that and you could feel us all gasp and hold our breath. I remember going through all kinds of emotions and even laughing at the absurdity of it all. You realize America is the home of Hollywood movies and it seemed like we\u2019d seen this before in a fictional action film. I remember saying that I was just waiting for the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man to come tromping around the corner next! I glued to the television for the next 5 days at least. For the next several years, my birthday was overshadowed (rightly so) and I got apologies for that being my birthday for a long time. Now days it just makes it hard for people to forget my birthday. I still like my birthday of course and it always turns out to be a beautiful, cooler end of summer day, just like it was in 2001.",

We then went back to our home room to await early dismissal because of \u201ca plane crash.\u201d It was weird, but we were all excited to go home. Not even a minute later, my brother and I were called to the office to go home. That was super weird and a massive red flag to my brother and I because 1) we rode the bus to school and 2) that meant either my mom, dad or both were picking us up when they were supposed to be at work.\n\nWe got to the office hallway and it was chaos. It seemed like every parent had rushed to the school to get their kids. I saw my dad and he physically grabbed both of us and rushed us home. I remember asking what was happening and he told me to be quiet so he could listen to the news in the car on the way home. He was just as confused as me. My parents both worked in DC and my dad kept calling my mom and telling her to get out of there as fast as possible. Didn\u2019t matter if she came home or went to a friends house nearby. He just wanted her to get away from the Capital and White House. She made it home safely a couple hours later. It was a hard day to process.",

The weight difference is absolutely massive. It really cannot be overstated how gigantic a full grown Tiger is. \n\nA gorilla can move at 25mph while a Tiger moves at 40mph and can jump up to 25 ft, and their muscle tissue is that of an ambush predator which is generally made for short and intense bursts of power. \n\nA gorilla cannot close their hands due to how they are built, making ranged attacks virtually impossible. They cannot make a true fist so they are limited to bites and open hand strikes.\n\n\nNow a gorilla wouldnt be alone very often so obviously a whole group of gorillas could chase off a Tiger, but for this specific scenario - the Tiger absolutely takes the win",

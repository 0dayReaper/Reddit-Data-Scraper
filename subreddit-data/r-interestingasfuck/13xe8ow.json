They also belong to the genus panthera, which means panther. Those 2 and North American cougars are generally what is referred to when somebody says panther. \n\nThere are wild jaguars outside of South America, ranging all the way up to Mexico. The only jaguar preserve in the world is located in Belize. Historically they ranged into the southwestern US as well, but have been extirpated since the 1940s. A male nicknamed El Jefe was seen multiples times over a 4 or 5 year span in the southwest, a little over 10 years ago, but he is more than likely dead now. No females or cubs have been seen since the 40's",

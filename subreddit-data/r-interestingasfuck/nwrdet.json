A lot of older apartments in Harlem are quite large, and are handed down generationally. \n\nI live in a rent-stabilized building just 2 blocks from where Ming and his owner lived, and we have quite a few 4 bedroom apartments. Many of the families have been here for 40 years, and are paying about $800 - 900/month.",

She was new to the zoo and seemed to get along with the male leopard. But various paw injuries hinted at matrimonial strife. Before any decision could be taken about what to do, she squeezed through a break in the roof bars of her cage and vanished in the night. The discovery that a wild carnivore was tree in their midst created an uproar among the citizens of Zurich. Traps were set and hunting dogs were let loose. They only rid the canton of its few half-wild dogs. Not a trace of the leopard was found for ten weeks. Finally, a casual labourer came upon it under a barn twenty-five miles away and shot it. Remains of roe-deer were found nearby. That a big, black, tropical cat managed to survive for more than two months in a Swiss winter without being seen by anyone, let alone attacking anyone, speaks plainly to the fact that escaped zoo animals are not dangerous absconding criminals but simply wild creatures seeking to fit in. \n\n&gt; And this case is just one among many. If you took the city of Tokyo and turned it upside down and shook it, you would be amazed at the animals that would fall out. It would pour more than cats and dogs, I tell you. Boa constrictors, Komodo dragons, crocodiles, piranhas, ostriches, wolves, lynx, wallabies, manatees, porcupines, orang-utans, wild boar\u2014that's the sort of rainfall you could expect on your umbrella. And they expected to find\u2014ha! In the middle of a Mexican tropical jungle, imagine! Ha! Ha! It's laughable, simply laughable. What were they thinking?\n  \n-- Yann Martel, *Life of Pi*",

Doctors determined he was mauled by something bigger.\n    \n &gt;   On Oct. 3, as Yates left the hospital, police checked out his fifth-floor apartment, drilled a hole through the door and spotted Ming.\n\nHey, this cut looks a lot bigger than a dog, better go over and check his place out.

Other people in the building and neighborhood seemed to be pretty aware of the tiger, but the story was spread to the point where a lot of people thought it was an urban legend or a rumor that got out of control. But the guy even had roommates at one point who lived with the Tiger and his mom had babysat children in the apartment with the Tiger. The dude bought so much raw chicken at the grocery store every day to feed the Tiger that people in the community actively commented about how he could possibly eat so much chicken. \n\nOne of the other commenters on here also said that people in the nursing home across the street often saw the Tiger in the window and would tell people about it but never be believed. To me, it seems like a classic case of the New Yorker \u201cmind your own business\u201d mentality.",

He deserved some peace.\u201d\n\nPolice pulled Ming from the Drew Hamilton Houses after a wild standoff on Oct. 3, 2003.\n\nHis owner turned the seven-room apartment into a menagerie, complete with an alligator named Al, and several other animals. Three days before, on Sept. 30, Yates walked into Harlem Hospital, seeking treatment for bite wounds he claimed were from a dog. Doctors determined he was mauled by something bigger.\n\nOn Oct. 3, as Yates left the hospital, police checked out his fifth-floor apartment, drilled a hole through the door and spotted Ming.\n\nWildlife experts joined the exotic scene, and Emergency Service Unit officer Martin Duffy rappelled down a rope from the seventh floor to shoot the 400-pound tiger with a tranquilizer dart. Yates spent three and a half months in jail for reckless endangerment.\n\n\n\nAuthorities placed Ming at Noah\u2019s Lost Ark that SAME year.\n\n\u201cHe lived a really good life here,\u201d Karnofel told the Daily News. \u201cHe was able to run and play on the grounds. He had tiger friends. He had a swimming pool. He was able to experience the elements.\u201d\n\nHis personality varied from happy to annoyed \u2014 like a typical tiger, she said \u2014 but it took about 10 years before the sanctuary decided to let the public visit him.\n\n\u201cI just thought it would give him some enrichment. He enjoyed watching people,\u201d he said.\n\nPhotographer Henry Jones said Ming was \u201cfrightened and confused\u201d when he first came to the sanctuary in 2003.\n\n\u201cFor over 15 years, \u200bhe lived here side by side to other rescued big cats, chuffing his salutations to his tiger companions, lounging in the sun, and feeling grass under his paws; all things he couldn\u2019t \u200bexperience in the apartment where he was raised,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe will miss him and cherish our memories of him. Ming was a majestic animal and quite a character. We \u200blove and honor him.\u201d",

Duesseldorf put quite a few major roads underground, making the old town, shopping area and the riverside all very welcoming for pedastrians and cyclists. There are also some walkthrough videos of the city in r/duesseldorf",

I couldn't see anything because of all the cream.\n\nI got out of the car and he was walking away! \nI crossed Rt 20, walked up to him and I told him he would not be walking away from me and that he clearly really wanted my attention and now he's got it. \n\nHe was easily like a foot and a half taller than me. He scoffed at me and kept walking. I was INSANE at the time because I was still gripped by whatever demons live inside you when you live and work in the Greater Boston Area. \n\nSo I walked in front of him and slapped him across the face and asked him why he stepped in front of a car like he had a DEATH WISH and threw a coffee at me. \n\nI ended up telling him I had more regard for his life than he did and what a shitty thing it would have been for me to have hit him and live with killing him for the rest of my life. \n\nHe ended up apologizing and he walked over to the Dunkin' donuts with me so that we could get water and paper towels to clean my car off together.\n\nHe started telling me about things going on in his life and I told him about things going on in my life.\n\nA police officer came by and asked if everything was okay. We said that we worked it out. \n\nHe told us.. THIS IS VERBATIM. THIS IS A QUOTE\n \"Stop being a couple-a fuckin' assholes and wasting everybody's time.\" \n\nWe agreed that was a good idea and he drove off.\n\n---\nWhen someone says people in Boston are nice, they mean nice like this which is like ... Terrifying, but I guess heart's are in a... place... Hearts are in a place.",

We recently reunified our town square from a four lane road bisecting our entire downtown making it ugly and un usable, but it took a few years and (not surprisingly) went over budget and still most people just wanted to complain about their drive home being 15 minutes longer or bemoan the lack of parking. It looks beautiful now and gets used for medium/large size events. But lots of the general public were too myopic to wait and see the benefits. They hate change and they hate being inconvenienced (and apparently paying for parking\u2026). Going to the public meetings was eye opening. Young people really need to get involved in local politics if we want to see change.",

Starting an unfinished project  that will be done in 10 years probably doesn't win hearts and minds. Like you said you'll probably anger people over construction and the fact it isn't complete overnight. That leads to ambitious politicians getting voted out.",

This means that even if a construction project is not economically viable they still get build. Then 20 years later, when its time for the county/city to fit the bill there is no money. Which means the county needs to create another quick influx of cash by building and selling more property with federal subsidies. \n\nNot Just Bikes has a great youtube video about it. Essentially the entire city planning strategy of the US is very short-sighted and unsustainable. The only reason it hasn't crunched yet is the immense wealth of the federal government keeping it on life support.",

See this video on [What happens to traffic when you tear down a freeway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6WtYTThkdU), particularly on its final section about the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the period of maximum constraint.\n\nFurthermore, when you account for the financial and social benefits most of these projects provide, such as rising property values AND denser and more plentiful mixed housing and economic centers, lower car pollution, increased foot traffic, and greater public safety, even if you can make the argument that the impact on traffic is materially substantive, the RoI for the city trading out freeways for actual public amenities makes the deal more than worth it.",

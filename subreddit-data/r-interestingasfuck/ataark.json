It is very unusual for us to get a juvenile animal as they stay with their owners when their small and cute.  It's when they grow into monsters like Yuki that can take a couch apart in the time it takes you to pee that they are abandoned.  By the time they come to us, they have been passed around through owners and shelters and are pretty much terrified of everything.  Their territory and bonds that they established naturally are long gone and it's our job to make them comfortable for the remainder of their life.",

He carries more weight than the wolves in the previous post.\n\n**EDIT**  Alright so let me explain why I say 120 for everyone doubting it. First off, there is some forced perspective going on in this picture.  He is a large animal, but he looks much larger than he actually is.  Second, wolves are built to be a large but light canine.  They lack the large diaphragm that most large dog breeds have which saves them a lot of weight.  They are also very narrowly built.  The large light colored animal in /u/britweins original post is a full-blooded wolf and I can tell you without question he is not 100 lbs.  So, I certainly could be under estimating him a bit, but I promise you he is not the 250 lb monster that he looks like. ",

This is done by Unexso in the Bahamas, specifically in Freeport.\n\nIt's unreal how many sharks are around you during the dive. I was on the very end, so I was bumped/nudged by tails and fins quite a bit, and had to keep my arms tucked in more than most other folks with cameras. Still got some crazy good pictures and video during it though.\n\nThe tube she has next to her is full of fish, btw. The feeder and camera-person are wrapped in chain mail, and go down first to lure in the sharks before the divers go down and get on their knees by the small shipwreck.\n\nEdit: Found the album from my 2014 trip that I posted to /r/scuba. http://imgur.com/a/mmsQC",

One night, in my mid 20\u2019s I have a random nightmare where I\u2019m being stalked in the woods by a pack of wolves at night. \n\nAll I had was a torch and a staff. I could hear twigs snapping and leaves rustling. The wolves would spill out from the tree line into the trail, bare their fangs and fade back into the woods. Obscured by the dark but the glint from my flame ever-so-slightly illuminating their eyes. \n\nI woke up before I was ever attacked. I wonder a lot about that dream because before then, I never considered wolves to be that scary. Just a pack of wild forest dogs. \n\nIt was like some primal part of my brain leapt out from my subconscious and said \u201cRemember human, this is what your ancestors feared and you shall too.\u201d\n\n",

The beef and pork is donated from various grocery stores where as the chicken we purchase at 49 cents a pound.  It is essentially \"tainted\" chicken because a box on the pallet was damaged in transit.  I am sure 99% of it would still be perfectly fine for human consumption.  The girl in the photo is one of our senior volunteers, I also started simply as a volunteer and just kind of worked my way up over time.\n\nI would be happy to continue to answer questions if you have them.  \n\n\n\\*\\*Edit\\*\\* I forgot to answer the question on being scared.  I do not \"fear\" them per se, I exercise caution with them and respect their abilities.  Thankfully, wolves are generally very expressive and predictable animals that will tell you how they feel long before they act so as long as you are listening, you should be fine.",

They are social animals so we want them to have other animals to socialize with, but we also encourage interaction so keeping our \"packs\" small minimizes the variables we have to keep track of while cleaning, feeding, etc.\n\nThese animals can not be released into the wild, they are not wildlife rehabs, they are captive bred animals usually bred for the purpose of being someone's exotic pet.\n\nWe don't buy sell or breed, we only rescue.  That said, we have had one animal born on site, and that was when one of our animals came with papers saying she had been spayed.  She hadn't, and we had two pups born.  One died in the first couple days, and one grew up to be four-socks.\n\nNo questions are silly, I'm happy to answer any question that someone takes the time to ask.\n\n",

Better for catching large prey.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolf\n\n**edit**: clearing up a misconception in the thread begun by the commenter below me. \n\nMost evidence suggests Dire Wolves hunted in packs.\n\nThey were just more specialized in taking large prey, and large prey became more scarce in the early Holocene\u2014this is is how *most* large Pleistocene predators went extinct.\n\nLook up \u201chistoric and modern range of the Gray Wolf\u201d and you\u2019ll see Gray Wolves rely on prey that is reasonably large, too\u2014they\u2019ve been extirpated from all regions where unregulated hunting in the 19th-20th century reduced deer, elk, and bison down to pitiful levels (before recovering in the late 20th).

Some never come around at all.  \n\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"how\", but the usual circumstances are one of the following:  \n\n* Animal has been abandoned at shelter to be euthanized if we don't step in.\n* Animal is found running free with no documentation connecting them to the owner and looks like shit  (likely release).\n* Animal is found running free with no documentation connecting them to the owner and looks healthy (likely escape by an unlicensed animal, owner doesn't come forward for fear of prosecution.\n* Owner contacts us begging us to take the animal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are captive bred animals that were never wild, and therefore can not return to the wild.  They also are socialized to human beings to some extent so it would be irresponsible to release them (many wildlife rehabs are euthanized because someone created a bond before turning them over to a rehabber).  It would also be 100% illegal.  We can't even legally release the few species that actually were born wild which is too bad because I'd love to release our coyotes.",

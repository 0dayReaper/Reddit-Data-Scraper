The water is packed into the minerals and when drilled into, the alleviation of pressure allows the release of water. This is my non-expert understanding of it, at least.\n\nSo you wouldn't see large underground lakes, unless there were large underground voids (which are extremely unlikely due to the immense pressure at such depths). These are more solid rock that when exposed will expel water.\n\nWhat I personally find most interesting about this though is that we know life can survive in truly extreme conditions, especially with access to water. Who knows just how deep into the earth life permeates.",

He was said to have loved her above all others and had statues of her placed alongside the colossal statues of him at the temple of Abu Simbel. Near the main temple complex is a smaller temple dedicated to her and the goddess Hathor.\n\nNefertiti was wife to Akhenaten who completely flipped the Egyptian pantheon on it's head and, iirc, is the first example of monotheism in history. Instead of the Gods like Isis, Horus, or Ra everything was replaced by Aten. This essentially made him a heretic in the eyes of priests and when he died and King Tutankhamun replaced him they turned the screws to have him abolish Atenism and replace it with the old pantheon.\n\nIf memory recalls. I did a paper when I was in Grade 12 on Akhenaten because we were studying world religions and I took something out of the ordinary.",

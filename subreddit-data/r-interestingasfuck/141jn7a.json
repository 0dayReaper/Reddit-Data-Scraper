It is impossible to bring most of them down because of the danger to those that would attempt it. Several of them have become well-known markers on the climb, such as \"Green Boots\". You are, quite truthfully, risking your life when you climb that mountain as humans cannot survive at that altitude for very long without assistance.",

I think it's on Amazon. \n\nJust as a warning if anyone is sensitive to this, it does show some human remains and images of bodies being recovered so if you watch with younger viewers that could be disturbing. However, I think the documentary does a really good job narrating how people who have come here have contaminated Everest, leaving things behind, including remains, not thinking about their actions of the climb and how that affects things like drinking water, etc",

It's actually quite sad knowing they may work their entire lives without ever fully paying down their debt.",

If there\u2019s a number that says per season, that is probably including the majority of Sherpas who carry gear, set up tents, cook food, run hotels, etc around the base of the mountain. Also the climbing season is 1-2 months, so even $2,000 per season isn\u2019t bad for being something like a cook consider the average monthly wage in Nepal is $600.",

My first reaction was to count the number of rows and columns to make sure they were indeed 99 but I got 104 so there are 5 duplicates. I did spot 2 that were duplicates in the first row \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 (the merciful).\n\nThe names you are referring to are longer than the typical arabic word. Or they could be compound words. I can't make out every single word as the script is unlike anything I've seen.\n\nDo you know how Chinese restaurants use Latin letters but disguised as Mandarin characters? This is like it but more difficult to decipher.",

I would say I was around 8 years old when this incident occurred, making her 6.\n\nOne day we were in the backyard playing, recreating the movie. I had a glass Gatorade bottle and was blowing in it to recreate the sound. Then my sister took it from me, making the sound, we got into a fight over it. She then hit me over the head with it, hard. \n\nAfter that, all I remember was running inside, with blood pouring down my face. I remember my head feeling cold from the blood loss. Then I\u2019m in the ER, getting stitches, then my parents didn\u2019t let us watch it anymore after that.",

Most semi-precious jews are marked up immensely. Google \"raw gems\" and unlike noble metals and diamonds, you'll find some disturbing cheap stones. I think I paid ten bucks last time i stocked up on rocks and for enough of about 12 varieties to last into the far future.\n\nEdit: As a semi-precious jew myself, I have decided to leave my mistake to raise awareness for my charity work. It's called Polish A Polish (get it?) and basically, we take northern European Jews, like myself, and let lapidaries go to town polishing and shaping them into beautiful princess cuts.",

When exposed to changes in temperature/pressure they're prone to 'crazing' which is basically when the opal dehydrates and forms loads of tiny cracks. My guess is the water spraying prevents this when cracking it open. And as someone else mentioned, water makes it look cooler. \n\nSource: gemmologist ",

The Ku Klux Klan would become his target.\n\nWorking in league with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Kennedy joined the Klan and multiple other Klan-affiliated organizations under the name of his dead uncle - a man who ironically enough was a proud and loyal Ku Klux Klan member for many years before his death.\n\nAfter he joined the Klan and donned his white robes, Kennedy worked tirelessly to gather up evidence which could be used to prosecute members of the Klan. His participation in the Klan yielded crucial information which he gave to state authorities over the course of 1946 and 1947.\n\nIn 1947, after a year of working undercover, Kennedy had to ditch his pseudonym and leave the Klan in order to testify in a trial against the leaders of a Klan-affiliated neo-Nazi group called \"The Columbians\" in Atlanta. His testimony ensured that the leaders of the Columbians were found guilty and sent to prison on charges of incitement to riot and usurping police powers. These Columbians and several others of the group had earned these charges by demonstrating outside the home of a black couple who bought the property from white owners.\n\nMany years later, Kennedy said about the Columbians, the Klan, and other racial supremacist groups: *\"There were an awful lot of evils abroad in the world at the time, as there still are, but I couldn't help but feel that racism was perhaps the most evil.\"*\n\nAfter leaving the Klan, Kennedy went on the radio program \"The Adventures of Superman\" and he told all of its listeners the innermost secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, including their codewords and solemn rituals. He even read out the roll call sheets of many sheriffs, public officials, and businessmen who attended Klan meetings.\n\nFor example, one secret which Kennedy exposed to the nation was that a traveling Klan member seeking out fellow Klansmen in a new town would ask for a \u201cMr. Ayak\u201d \u2014 \"Ayak\u201d (Are You a Klansman?) If the other person's response was: \u201cYes, and I also know a Mr. Akai\u201d \u2014 \"Akai\" (A Klansman Am I), then the Klan member knew he had a buddy.\n\nKennedy's trivialization and exposure of the Klan's secrets on the radio show were credited with stripping the Klan's mystique from them and causing damage to their recruitment rates. Not only this, but some of the information which Kennedy collected during his infiltration helped the IRS press for the collection of a $685,000 tax lien from the group - a massive hit to the Klan's pocketbooks.\n\nNaturally, the Klan was severely unhappy by what Kennedy had done. The Klan firebombed his house several times in retaliation. That, coupled with many threats to his life, forced Kennedy to flee to France for eight years. But Kennedy later returned home to Florida and he was credited with taking part in civil rights sit-ins in the 1960s, and he also reported on demonstrations led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe Klan never got Kennedy for what he did to the organization - he died peacefully in 2011.",

These goons had *the dumbest, kindergartenest-ass secret language* and rituals. As soon as everyone else could see it they were a laughingstock. I mean a brutal, evil laughingstock -- but a ridiculous one, too. How they ever took themselves seriously I hope I'll never know.",

This pseudonymous collaborator, Green alleged, was in fact responsible for the most daring of Kennedy's undercover revelations.\\[citation needed\\]",

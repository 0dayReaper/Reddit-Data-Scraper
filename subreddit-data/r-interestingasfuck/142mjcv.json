API 2003, September 2015 edition, section 5.4.1, \u201cInherent Grounding\u201d, states that metallic tanks, equipment, and structures commonly found in the industry that are in direct contact with the ground have proved to be sufficiently well grounded to provide for safe propagation to ground of lightning strokes. It goes on to further state that supplemental grounding by means of driven ground rods neither decreases nor increases the probability of being struck, nor does it reduce the possibility of ignition of the contents.\n\nNFPA has its own requirements but the fact there is not some industry standard is mind blowing to me.",

This is known as \"forked lightning\". The combination of each leader (stepped and dart) and their subsequent return strokes is known collectively as a \"stroke\". As the negative charge gets close to the ground, a positive charge, called a streamer, reaches up to meet the negative charge. The channels connect and we see the lightning stroke.",

This is not a delicate electronic circuit susceptible to high voltage or current discharge, in which case a grounded shield matters.  \n\n- there had to be oxygen present above (or mixed with) whatever was in the tank, in order for it to ignite like that.   Except for things like some rocket fuels and explosives that do not require an oxidizer from the ambient surroundings, air/oxygen has to be present in order to ignite.   \n\nThe only risk I can think of that can be mitigated by a lightning shield as other comment mentioned, IF oxygen is not present, is sudden vaporization of part of the tank\u2019s contents in contact with the suddenly very hot metal, where the lightning created a high electrical current- like an incandescent light bulb but waaaaaay bigger.  \nAnd what is an explosion but a sudden conversion from something into a gas, or sudden thermal expansion of a gas.   But it looks to me like that was an explosion created from rapid oxidization of a flammable substance in the tank, indicating oxygen was present in the tank.",

Up till this point we'd only ever observed the individual star, up to that point we could only look up and see a massive sea of lights. So we've made progress in seeing more and more as we've had better and better technology / methods.\n\n\nI wonder if some day there will be a technology that could collect light to fine enough point to see the smaller bodies around the star, maybe even to a point where we could get a decent image of each of the planets in the system.",

If, and it\u2019s a long shot, but IF the James Webb Telescope detects O2 in the atmosphere of an exoplanet? That would constitute very strong evidence for extraterrestrial life. It\u2019s possible that by this time next year we may find extraterrestrial life.",

I know that carbon based life on earth seems to require it, but ive always felt that the idea that life that evolved that far away, would resemble in the slightest what we know as life, is ludicrous. I\u2019m not in anyway a scientist with any knowledge but I\u2019ve always wanted floating wraith like tentacle monsters that breathed in carbon dioxide and exhale methane or something like that. Is there any reason to expect intelligent life to be bipedal and follow a similar anatomy? I\u2019m but a silly dreamer asking a question. On that note, say humans could go and live in this new solar system, how long would it take the new atmospheric pressures and available elemental resources to force humans to evolve into something unrecognizable as what we consider human?

Most likely these are gas giants given we can actually see them like that (implying size and distance) but who knows, and that doesn't rule out a lot more planets we aren't seeing not to mention the possibility of what goes on with moons around larger planets. Hell we're starting to realize we may not have seen all the planets in our own solar system yet.",

That said, if you assumed that there were a bunch more planets of smaller sizes, You'd probably be right. There could be anywhere between 2 and 40 planets in that system.",

Late to the party, but I want to share that **the title is 100% wrong.**\n\nDirect detections of exoplanets have been going on for many years- I've actually done research in following-up (natural) radio emission from such nearby systems, and we have several choices in directly imaged exoplanetary systems, much closer than this one! (No luck in detecting anything from the exoplanets, yet, but we can distinguish between detected emission from the star versus the planet so that's cool.) Instead what this is is the first directly imaged solar system *around a sun-like star*.  [The original source says this much.](https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2011/) Further, most of the sources in this image are *not* exoplanets but instead are background objects or artifacts- [here](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso2011a/) are the ones that are the real ones.\n\nSo, still cool, but very misleading title!  Direct imaging is actually a really neat field that has been around for awhile!",

The bright and dark rings we see on the star\u2019s image are optical artefacts. \n\nThat was my next question - the fiery ring around the sun is caused by the coronagraph.",

If I went back in time to the day Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, and put $100,000 cash in a money pit, and then came back every day and put another $100,000 in that pit.  Day after day, for 2,021 years, $100,000 in the pit.  Today, I would have less than half of what Jeff Bezos is worth.",

You could go back to the unification of Ancient Egypt in like 3100 BC and spend 100K EVERY SINGLE DAY until today and you'd still wouldn't have spent as much money as Elon Musk is worth. In fact you would still be about another 300+ yrs away from hitting his purported 200B+ net worth.",

Their star is around 17 million years old which is A LOT younger than our Sun which is thought to be 4.5 billion years old. This find has been considered by many scientists to be one of the most historic solar system related discoveries to happen since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.",

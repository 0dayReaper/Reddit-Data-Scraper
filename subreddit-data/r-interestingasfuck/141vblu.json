His video may not be crystal clear but it\u2019s not just a bunch of rumors and he ACTUALLY saw the craft, described it. Lmao you\u2019re trying to insult me for choosing Bob\u2019s testimony over a wad of nothing. Yeah, I choose the \u201cnot so clear video\u201d. It\u2019s definitely something\u2026 again you\u2019re defending a rumor and no eye witness to any crafts. I think wanting more isn\u2019t so crazy, you should want more for yourself, pal. \nNot pulling apart any arguments because that would mean I care about your opinion and I don\u2019t. I just rather have more substance than you do and that\u2019s fine. Be happy with your plate of nothing. \n\nAnd cheers for not downloading Tiktok atleast we can agree on that one thing.",

He was part of the AATIP UAP task force then, and had clearance to see the programs, their funding and how they were nested in government, and provided evidence to the IG\n\nHe experienced retaliation for his complaint, which was supposed to be confidential.  Last summer he filed another complaint, this time with the Intelligence Community Inspector General - who deemed his complaint credible, and urgent.  The complaint was forwarded to Avril Haines and congress/senate oversight, where they are currently investigating the allegations and the evidence.  \n\nBoth complaints were filed by his lawyer, who was also an Inspector General in 2011 previously.  \n\nHere is an extensive breakdown of the vetting process used.

Seems like your whole thinking turns only around our planet.\n\nI try to explain it to you.\n\nIf we're not alone, and we're definitely aren't, since space is endless (which we as humans can't perceive), then there will be species, which could be millions or billions and even older, not just out of the glibbering goo like us. \n\nThese old species maybe, have found a way to travel through space. Maybe through resources our system doesn't contain or whatever.\n\nAs said, the space is endless. Means that even space traveling billion years old species, will not only not know our planet, but our whole solar system or maybe even the whole milkyway star cluster. \n\nObviously when traveling space, they must have technology which can scan through far areas of the space and also map it at the same time, because they want to know, where they come from. \n\nLet's say, they're foraging, they just choose a point on the space ship screen and start cruising that way and they fly and fly and fly, who knows, hundreds of years since they can get a million years old or whatever, you get the point. \n\nSpace is rough, solar winds, asteroids and what not are brutal things and let's say at some point, their ship got a damaged and needed maintenance.\n\nWhat would be the first step? Looking through your map data for a planet to land on and they found what they where looking for, even multiple choices.\n\nSome would be too far away to reach with the damaged ship, some are too dangerous or uninhabitable, but there are 2 or 3 planets which are fine. Within reach and habitable and they chose the planet with the calmest atmosphere, it's earth.\n\nBut aside from that, that dude surely talks bullshit, out of various reasons.",

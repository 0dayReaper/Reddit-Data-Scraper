Apparently there has been over 1200 firefighters from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the United States that have come to help put them out so thank you guys for that!  \n\n\nThe sad part about this is that when the fires first started there was no recorded lightning strikes anywhere near the area so the idea is that a lot of them were man made. Some places in Nova Scotia have raised the fines for breaking fire ban laws up to 20k and some people are still burning garbage in their yards... Consistently surprised by the stupidity of the majority.",

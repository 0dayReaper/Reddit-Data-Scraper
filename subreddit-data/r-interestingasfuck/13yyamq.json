            "comment": "The balls had TWO goals: the primary goal is to prevent chemical treatments added to the water from converting to carcinogenic bromate in the sunlight. The secondary goal was to prevent evaporation. Though, there is evidence that the technique was not as effective as initially thought and really just \"robbed Peter to pay Paul\" (at least when it came to conservation). \n\nSo they probably decided on black instead of white because, even though it would trap solar energy rather than reflect it, it would let less light through to interact with the chemical treatment. Basically a trade off where they erred on the side of being more effective against bromate and less effective against evaporation than the other way around. That's just conjecture on my part, though.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/science/why-96-million-plastic-shade-balls-dumped-into-the-la-reservoir-may-not-save-water",

It is a useful scavenger of oxygen radicals, one of many reasons it is ubiquitous to the tire industry, but even tire formulations contain significant loads of antioxonants and antidegradants.\n\nWhite polymers loaded with ZnO or TiO2 are at least as stable as carbon black filled polymers, and often moreso because they aren't subjected to extreme solar heating from carbon blacks absorption of IR.\n\nSome examples of this are white Tedlar film used in the PV and architectural industries which has 40+year lifetimes and greatly outperforms black backsheet materials.\n\nSolar roofs are another prime example. White solar reflective elastomers used as roof coatings retain mechanical properties significantly longer than traditional black roof coatings and also greatly decrease transmitted heat due to the high reflection and emissivity of the coating to solar IR",

I mean, you are right that the article frames it that way, but it also shows why the framing is misleading:\n\n&gt; This means shade balls would need to stay on the Los Angeles Reservoir for at least a year or more to save water. Depending on exactly where the shade balls are made, **it could take up to 2.5 years to recover the water used.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Since shade balls have stayed on the Los Angeles Reservoir since 2015, they are likely now starting to save more water than they cost to produce.**\n&gt; \n&gt; The LA Department of Water and Power said they plan to keep shade balls as a permanent solution to water quality issues on the Los Angeles, **replacing them every 10 years.** LA officials also deployed shade balls at three other reservoirs, between 2008 and 2012, where they stayed temporarily for five to nine years.\n\n&gt; The team cautioned that water savings from the shade balls will likely be less than 300 million gallons during years when there is no drought. That's because evaporation of water decreases when the air isn't as dry. The actual period of time needed to recover water from shade ball manufacturing might even be longer. \n\n(emphasis added)\n\nThe balls were deployed in 2015. The article you cite was written in 2018. That is THREE YEARS after they were deployed, and the conservative estimate they cite was 2.5 years to see am RoI.  It is now 2023. How much water was saved over the last 5 years? And the 10 years between replacements won't occur for another year yet.\n\nI am not arguing for or against these balls. I had never heard of them before tonight. \n\nBut the article you cite is absolutely using a loaded framing of the arguments against these balls. It's sad because I generally respect PBS as a news source, but their fact checkers absolutely failed on this one, unless I am missing something *big*. I almost hope I am, because I would rather PBS be right than me, but I don't think I did.",

The video claims this will save 300 million gallons of water - though doesn't specify over what time period. 300 million gallons is 454 and a quarter Olympic size swimming pools. 300 million gallons of water is basically nothing.\n\nIf we assume that 300 million gallons is in one year (and I'm somewhat dubious on that - I'm thinking its over 10 years based on the 100 to 1000 claim), and we assume these will last for 20 years (they won't), then it saves 6 billion gallons over their lifetime they are paying 6/10ths of a cent per gallon. That's not necessarily unreasonable in California, which has a very high cost of water, but it seems like a rounding error in the total amount of water saved and there would be additional costs associated with installing and maintaining the system and it relies ***very*** heavily on my best case assumption. I'm guessing plastic ball industry made out like a fucking bandit.",

While the two sound the same there is a distict difference. White balls would be much brighter and would reflect, allowing more light into the gaps between. The black balls are essentially absorbing the heat so the water doesn't. So, yes they do attract heat but that's intentional :)",

White would hands down be better at cooling, but I suspect that cooling isn\u2019t the main reason the balls are added.\n\nAny heat absorbed by the balls has to go somewhere. It either goes into the air above or the water below. Knowing that there is a conductive liquid below and an insulator (air) above, the majority of the energy absorbed will go into the water.  Having balls of a colour that absorbs less energy would result in less energy going into the water.  Mirrored balls would be ideal, but would be a lot more money lol.",

Of course, over time, there's debate on whether these stones are worshiped cause of their resemblance to a dick or whether they represent something else altogether, and are probably just a symbol.\n\nBut yeah.... Something that *may* be a God's dick is worshiped in India.",

These are also known as '[deadheads](https://www.passagemaker.com/technical/boat-safety-the-dreaded-deadhead)' because they are extremely hazardous to boats. Basically there's a huge log underwater, then a head poking out of the top of the water. You can't tip it because it's already basically a long line pointing down into the deep.",

Mate, we are an absolute unit by comparison \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\n\nTo be fair though, that's comparing a single state to an entire country ([although most of Australia's states are bigger than Texas anyway.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/5vomk8/texas_is_not_a_very_large_state_western_australia/)) It does explain why Australians seem to actually grasp the scale of the U.S better than most tourists I've met though, it's a pretty comparable scale.\n\nOn a related note, I met a German couple in New York City that thought they could drive to New York, Miami, and L.A. in a week. They seemed a bit crestfallen when I politely explained to them that while it's technically possible, they're gonna spend all their time driving, not sightseeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit-Changed \"all' to \"most\".

It's neat to see a native set the record straight.\n\nAs a Southerner in the US, I can say that stereotypes can definitely get a little annoying. Everyone not from the South thinks that since I'm from Arkansas I must be a hick and ask me why I am wearing shoes or where my overalls are at.\n\nFor the record, I'm wearing shoes because it's Walmart day (pay day) and they won't let anyone in without shoes now and my overalls are getting washed by mawmaw down in the creek.",

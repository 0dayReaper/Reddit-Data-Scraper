The Golden Gate Bridge can\u2019t handle 25,000 cars at one time due to just space. \n\nI assume you can understand the engineers fears at this point\n\n\nEdit - I may have underestimated the amount of people.\n\nLet\u2019s say 30 x 180 (lbs) = 5400 (lbs) \n\n500,000 / 30 = 16,666 cars. The GG Bridge also can\u2019t handle 16,666 cars at one time\n\nEdit #2 - 800,000 people!!!! Not sure how I ducked that one up. Anywho. Above math applies \n\nBut now 800,000 / 30 = 26,666 cars. The GG Bridge can\u2019t handle that many cars at one time\n\n\nMath is hard first thing in the morning, especially when my wife made me wake and bake\n\nEdit #3 - the Golden Gate Bridge avgs 120,000 cars a day. That means it avgs 83 cars a minute and it takes about 4 minutes to go across that\u2019s about 332 cars on the bridge, traffic jam maybe increases that to 1200 cars fully jam packed?\n\nEdit #4 - ish\n\nEdit #5 - [turns out only 300,000 people were on the bridge and apparently the engineers weren\u2019t worried.](https://www.sfgate.com/local-donotuse/article/golden-gate-bridge-walk-1987-anniversary-disaster-13896571.php)",

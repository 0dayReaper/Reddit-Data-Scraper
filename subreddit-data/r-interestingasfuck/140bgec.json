Although a lot of people look at colorization negatively as \"getting further from the original\" I actually feel the opposite way. \n\nEven if colors are not 100% accurate, we people see world in color (except blind or color-blind people, who see it differently), so coloration makes photos more accurate, not less.\n\nI am sure she will be glad to receive it!",

This photo is from USSR (now Ukraine), where photos in color were extremely rare even in the 1990s. My family has literally 0 photos in color, and the same thing I hear almost from anyone from post-USSR space. \n\nPeople often underestimate how much USSR was behind the US back then. Hope it answers some of your questions ;)",

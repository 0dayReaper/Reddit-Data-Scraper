He came up with the shape of the tile and suspected it could be the elusive aperiodic monotile. However, not being a mathematician, he had no idea how to prove it formally, so he contacted Chaim (i think) first and he in turn contacted the two others and together they came up with a proof.",

NOT A PROOF. It is an exhibit or conjecture with their conclusion being an exhibit of a infinite aperiodic monotile. Page 44 is one reason this isn't a proof and their are at least 6 other monotiles by Robinson et AL that have the same basic properties. \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10798v2.pdf\n\n&gt; Conclusion: We have exhibited an einstein, the first topological disk that tiles aperiodically with no additional constraints or matching conditions.\n\n&gt; As with Robinson\u2019s aperiodic set of six shapes [Rob71], it is conceivable that hats could tile infinite sectors of the plane, which could then be combined into tilings with infinite \u201cfault lines\u201d that lie on the boundary of supertiles at all levels. Future work should examine the possibility of tilings with fault lines, as part of characterizing the full space of hat tilings.",

My brief conclusion is that every piece would be able to fit together with others, therefore it would mean the picture is the only thing to guide whether the pieces are in the right place. Everyday images (or your kid\u2019s favourite show) should be fairly straight forward to put together, but things like baked beans would be nightmarish I think. \n\nAlso, without the tabs, it would need a frame to stay together unless uniform tabs were used but that would automatically make it easier since the pieces would have to be orientated uniformly. \n\nIn short, I\u2019d be up for buying one but won\u2019t commit to finishing it.",

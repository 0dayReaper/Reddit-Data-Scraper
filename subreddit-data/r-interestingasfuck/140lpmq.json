So, you place the bomb inside, turn the hand crank that pulls up the steel cable that I assume is connected to the top of the lid. The lid is pulled up but since it's bigger than the opening it just gets pulled tightly against it to seal it. When the bomb goes off, it literally can't \"blow the top off\" because of a weak hinge or whatever like an outer lid would have.\n\nThat's my guess.",

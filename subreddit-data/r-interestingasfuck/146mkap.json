At some point (I think in the 90s) became illegal, because of obvious dangers of flying pieces that would injure people. It's now soft of replaced with people throwing flowers to the singers that the venue itself prepares. Pretty harmless and easier to sweep.  \n\n\nNowadays you can only find this happening in a few places, one I've been was just outside of the city of Larisa and is called Faliro. The plates are not real, they're made from a plaster kind of material, but it's still really fun to just go for it.",

I've seen that multiple times, still can't 100% tell you if it's the floor or the singer, but it looks like it's the latter. I'm not a huge fan of the culture, so it's based off of experience.",

It was the \"Polterabend\" where family and friends would destroy dishes in front of the couple's new home on the evening before the wedding day to wish them a nice, married future.\n\nIt's to scare away the Poltergeist (a noisy, bad ghost which brings bad luck, loves to prank and terrorize people and destroy things). So you need to be just as noisy as the ghost that might live in the couple's new home to make sure it stays away.\n\nBut since dishes are quite expensive and nobody really wanted to clean that up, they exchanged the sound of smashing dishes with the sound of incredibly drunk people - or something like that.",

The motion of the electrons induced by the moving magnet generates a second electromagnetic field coming from the copper, which basically makes it a temporary electromagnet. That secondary field is in opposition to the field of the magnet, which slows down the magnet motion.\n\nWhile all of this is going on, the copper does heat up, which is where the bulk of the kinetic energy goes, but some also goes into generating that magnetic field, which slows and stops the magnet.\n\nLove this stuff.",

The magnetic field is forcing a dipole and changing orientations will allow you to feel the forces resisting or amplifying the motion. If you do not move the pie tin you do not feel any force or attraction.",

And moving electrons generate a magnetic field of their own, thereby creating a magnetic field from the copper induce by the magnet.",

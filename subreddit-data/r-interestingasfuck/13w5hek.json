Our word for butterfly is *Schmetterling*. \n\n*Schmettern* (verb) means smash, or throw violently, dash or spike (a ball). *-ling* is a suffix to denote the origin or feature of a person, or a diminuitive aspect. So Schmetterling, purely etymologically, would be a (little) thing that smashes.\n\n*Zerschmettern* is a more violent form of the above verb: smash to pieces, crush, smite.\n\n*Zerschmetterling* would be one of my band names, if ever I had a metal or punk band.\n\n^(thx for listening to my TED talk...)",

Ships can sail from Chicago to the Atlantic, via the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nI still remember watching the foreign vessels docking in Chicago for *Chriskindlmarkt*, the annual German Christmas Festival in downtown Chicago.\n\nI had been working in downtown on 9/11/2001.  When news spread, we raced to the 3rd-floor lunchroom to watch TV.  That TV was ominously mounted just above a window overlooking Sears Tower, which had just become the tallest building left standing in the US.  Eyes were darting from the TV to the window, fearing it might be next.\n\nThat December, we cheered a German warship docking at Navy Peer.  Draped over the port side were two giant flags; German &amp; US.  Between them was a makeshift banner which read: **\"GERMANY IS WITH YOU!!\"**  Few if any German sailors bought their own beer that day.\n\nI have fond memories of the Dunes.  I immediately recognized that sunset, without reading the title.  Camped there many times.  Used to race my dog up those huge dunes -- or pretend to.\n\nI'd unleash him and say go.  We'd both start running, but I'd stop after about five steps, and he'd gallop like Secretariat all the way up!  At the top, he'd turn around and see me still at the bottom, laughing.  I could almost sense him thinking, *\"You d\\*ck!\"*",

Let's call it 32. That cuts the ~~top~~\\* bottom 682 feet off of the closest buildings. At 50 miles, nothing could be visible by normal means and you would need to be either above it, or have it refracted as you said.\n\nBut at the actual \"straight-line\" distance, it's only about 30 miles. Also, there are only about 30 buildings in chicago that are &gt;650 feet tall. And...I'd wager we're seeing most of them in this photo.\n\n\\* [I am smert](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ooawkq/chicago_skyline_visible_from_nearly_50_miles_away/h6110dr/)",

If we imagine a tree, just on the shore, you won't be able the base of that tree because of the curve. If the earth was flat, you could see the base.\n\nEdit: I am too lazy to write everything down and that picture is probably not the best for demonstration purposes because we need a certain distance (to Chicago) to see the curvature. Another important point is the height at which the shot has been taken because that makes a big difference.\n\nCheck these two videos from the same guy.   \nThe second video is like an appendix with more info: \n\n* [In search of a flat earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44)\n* [The Minnewanka Curve Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8MboQzXO1o)\n\nFor the ones interested in the math beside it, go to the second video at 00:23",

So this calculator https://www.boatsafe.com/calculate-distance-horizon tells us the distance to horizon given a certain height. I just started plugging in random heights and if this is truly a distance of 50 miles, we should only be able to see the very tip top of the Willis Tower. There are buildings that are ~1/5th as tall as the tallest building in that skyline right? So lets say one of them is Willis tower at 1450 feet tall. Even if we say that the shortest building in the skyline is still 725 feet tall that means we should only be able to see it from ~36 miles away. I personally believe that some of those buildings are only as tall as ~1/5th of 1450 which is 290 feet. That should only be visible from ~22 miles. \n\nSomeone smarter than me, what am I missing here?\n\nEdit: As I suspected, the distances involved here are not accurate. It's closer to 32 miles:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hELqaql.png\n\nDouble edit: Are flat earthers downvoting me??",

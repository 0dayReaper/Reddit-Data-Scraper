Not the US... \nAnd 'free food and shelter'... yea... subsistence level living is REAL beneficial to anyone.... \n\n&gt;I'm sure the slaves in 3rd world countries are really enjoying it when they can afford to pay rent after working 14hrs without any care for their well being. After all, it is when you work hard that you can feel joy.\n\nThere are degrees to that, and your sarcasm doesn't suit you in this regard. I can see mechanicals aiding to relieve the worst of their situations, but to eliminate the need for work? No.\n\n&gt;When you grow up you'll realize that work is one of the worst things, and one of the primary cause of human suffering (other than disease).\n\nI am grown up, and I have been working most of my adult life. \nYes, work is hard, but it seems you don't realise that you are living an illusion if you think that removing the struggle of working from people's lives would ultimately improve them.\n\nNow the question is, how long have you been working? Or have you ever had to work?\n\n\nEven if people are freed to pursue what they like or their dreams, how much value do you actually think they will find in those things if everything is handed to them?",

Specifications for telescopes may as well be written in Greek for me but this would help me have some perspective when shopping. I know we have to easily be in the thousands of $$ but are we talking $2k? 5k? 10?",

You then have a program that stacks all the photos together and can enhance the image. \n\n\nSo basically yeah, expensive scope for sure but the most expensive parts are usually the mounts for the scope and the camera set up etc. Probably somewhere around the 10k mark, maybe a few grand less.\n\n\nEdit: Adding if you want to get into telescopes, you can get some very capable scopes known as dobsonian telescopes. You won't see anything like this but it's still a lot of fun, just look up what to expect first.",

You can absolutely see other galaxies, the thing is it wont be colorful. It will look more black and white. Like seeing a slightly spiral smudge haha.\n\nHowever, knowing that smudge is another GALAXY is mind blowing. Something about actually seeing it with your own eyes and not in a photo or on a screen makes all the difference.\n\nSome of the most beautiful and colorful things to look at are globular clusters. Those are basically little star factories and they can be downright gorgeous. I also love to see Jupiter's moons. You can actually see the shadow that the moons cast on the surface of Jupiter. That's a trip.\n\nAstronomy is such a cool hobby. It's also pretty affordable with a used telescope. After the initial investment, you don't really have to spend any money unless you want to upgrade your eyepieces or get into photography.",

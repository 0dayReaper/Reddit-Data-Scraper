Here it is for the lazy:\n\n\nCommuter Rachel Watson (Emily Blunt) catches daily glimpses of a seemingly perfect couple, Scott and Megan, from the window of her train. One day, Watson witnesses something shocking unfold in the backyard of the strangers' home. Rachel tells the authorities what she thinks she saw after learning that Megan is now missing and feared dead. Unable to trust her own memory, the troubled woman begins her own investigation, while police suspect that Rachel may have crossed a dangerous line.",

Cozy and super comfortable with a very efficient use of the space. https://www.instagram.com/p/B3HPQqUBQP4/?igshid=1glt4f9bm6npb\n\nAlso, the lobby was on the 4th floor of a shopping mall, and the rest of the floors above it were all the rooms. So just going downstairs I had a full mall to explore which had a nice food court, a rock climbing wall and indoor bicycle track. It was wild, yo. Maybe if we did malls like that in the US they wouldn\u2019t be dying.",

I am sure they market this as a privacy issue, when in reality it is a tourism and money issue.\n\nWhere I live, we just build turnpikes to avoid poor people.  They buy up the houses in poor neighborhoods to put up walled roads that poor people can't afford to drive on.  You go from one upper middle-class neighborhood to the next without ever having to encounter a house with boarded up windows - even though you drive by dozens of them.\n\nEdit:  Didn't think this comment would be such a wild ride!  Haha.  The follow-up comments  work together to paint a portrait I think we can all learn from - especially me.  First, if the poster who said that Singapore's homeless rate is low and the city is as clean as they described, my assumption above is clearly wrong.\n\nBut multiple links were provided by other posters to indicate why I assumed that way.  Cities definitely use the kind of zoning and city planning I described to hide poverty-stricken areas.  For those who don't know or denied it in the comments, those links provide good educational opportunities.\n\nEdit 2:  6 hours after editing, I'm still being flooded with \"you've never been to Singapore!\" and \"those are noise barriers!\"  Guys... I know they're noise barriers.  I've never been to Singapore.  I acknowledged my mistaken assumptions in the first edit.  I'm not quite sure why everyone is so triggered.",

Those windows were basically magic to me when I rode on the trains as a 15 year old back then.\n\nAs someone who used to live in the flat apartments right beside the tracks, I appreciated having those windows turning opaque as the train goes past my home.\n\nNow I'm staying in another neighbourhood which also has this LRT system but the trains are not equipped with these magic windows. Luckily for me, my home is nowhere near the tracks.",

Can you not pull politics into every single shit in your life?\n\nMy country is not perfect, but we are still far, far from China where minorities are oppressed to the point of being genocided and housed in concentration camps. \n\nNeither is America perfect.\n\nStop acting all almighty and forcing other countries and societies to adhere to your ideals.\n\nOh wait, your country has a barely functioning public healthcare system, badly maintained infrastructure, a deeply divided political system whereby climate change and even wearing of mask is a partisan issue, and nothing significant can be done to improve the livelihoods of many in your country.\n\nAnd by the way, i am not a shill of the CCP and China. Expressing my slight distaste for Americans shoving down their thoughts about others does not equate to worshiping China and the Communist Party. Thank you.",

That's never really been a deterrent for me nor have I ever thought to complain about it, so I can't imagine this being any worse.",

Its technical name is PDLC (polymer dispersed liquid crystal) and it is double-paned glass with a sandwiched film layer, which contains liquid crystals. In the OFF state, the liquid crystals are randomly dispersed, effectively blocking light passage (imagine trying to see across a field with 1,000 randomly dispersed people). When the liquid crystal layer is energized (when an electrical input is delivered), the liquid crystals polarize (line up), making the glass clear (imagine trying to see across a field with 1,000 people in a straight line, parallel to you).",

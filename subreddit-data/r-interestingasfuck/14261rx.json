A lot of the emphasis on war comes from European interpretations of the game. Lyle Thompson has some videos and interviews where he talks about how the main purpose of the game is to honor the creator and have fun. The sport was certainly rougher and more violent than it is today but that is true of just about any sport (people dying in football/rugby games was pretty common until the 1900s).",

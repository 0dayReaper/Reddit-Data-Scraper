It's going to take individuals in communities rallying others around them to demand changes, such as banning plastic bags from grocery stores or demanding all restaurants use compostible to go containers. It's a drop, but the more we start to demand the more buisnesses get the message and roll over on their own. Take Black Friday for instance, it started with a few companies not opening and now they all feel pressured to do it. We won't get anything until we start placing demands.",

The prices of all necessities were rising by the day and he was openly selling pieces of national heritage pretty much for free. Anyway, people (his own supporters included) obviously weren\u2019t happy and there were a lot of riots. Like, A LOT. Then the fateful day came where the people decided to riot outside the president\u2019s house cuz nothing was being fixed. \n\nHere\u2019s where the big problem happened. Nasheed ordered the military (not the cops, the actual men in green) to stand guard outside the house and SHOOT anyone who got close. This was also openly announced so everybody was in a panic. Then the cops who were undecided (because even they knew the situation of the country was bad but couldn\u2019t disobey orders) came out with riot shields to protect the people and there was a standoff outside the house. A civil war was pretty much about to break out at any second. \n\nThen just as things were about to go down, the colonel showed up. This dude is basically a living legend, who pretty much trained everyone in the military. He just walked up to the military guys and looked them dead in the eye for a few seconds and told them to recite their oath. The oath they took to protect the people. What followed was a lengthy lecture that pretty much left everybody speechless. The military lowered their weapons. And the colonel called out the president for a chat. It was just the two of them in a room and he very simply told him \u201cPlease resign. For your sake and the country\u2019s.\u201d (There was an audio recording for the public to hear)\n\nNasheed agreed.... and called out bs the very next day saying he was at gunpoint. But hardly anyone bought it after all the lies he said before (Honestly I don\u2019t know either but I\u2019m inclined not to believe it). Nobody heard much from him until he decided to come back for the latest election after his period of exile.",

This was an absolutely excellent publicity stunt, which will land him in history books for years (I hope). \n\n\nIf you\u2019re interested or want an easy watch, see the film made about him! It\u2019s called The Island President, snd it\u2019s such an inspirational yet heartbreaking watch. It explains his battle against dictatorships and the history behind the Copenhagen Summit 2009. \n\nThis man was also the person who brought democracy to the island after a 30 year rule, and defeated the former dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, if you\u2019re interested in that sort of thing. I only wish I could write to him and thank him for his tireless campaigns",

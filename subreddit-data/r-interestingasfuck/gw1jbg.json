Food production was very labour intensive, and the society can't exactly skimp on food production no matter how bougie they feel. Labour was in fact quite scarce since so much of it was locked in for food production.\n\nToday, thanks to technology allowing less labour to be expended for farming, labour is so cheap that ordinary people could afford to pay someone to cook and serve food and clear the table for them. That was something reserved for barons and up before the modern era, meaning less than 2% of the population.",

Properly proportioned, the serpentine shape can be more brick-efficient than other strategies for stabilizing a tall, narrow structure (like adding piers or buttresses).\n\nOne extra course of bricks, while doubling the materials bill, wouldn't widen the effective footprint of the wall *nearly* as much as any of those other options.",

For any wave shape of wall, the \"peaks\" are in the exact same position, and there's no shorter distance between them than a straight line, which gives you a zig zag.\n\nThe wave shape might affect stability though, since the sine wave has more bricks further from the center line, which may make it more or less stable.",

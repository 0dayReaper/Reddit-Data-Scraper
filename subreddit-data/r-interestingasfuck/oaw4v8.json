They spent thousands of dollars (they won\u2019t say how much) to buy the puppy then have spent thousands more on medical expenses as the years go by. Seems like they\u2019re always taking it to the vet for some procedure or another. She\u2019s a great dog with lots of personality but I always feel so sorry for her that she\u2019s got all these medical issues.",

For example, if a breed is prone to hip dysplasia, good breeders will test for genetic hip health beforehand and make sure the dogs they're breeding are not likely to pass on poor hips to the next generation. However, there is only so much breeding within the breed will help. It doesn't matter how many times you breed two pugs, they won't get healthier unless we start introducing non-pugs into their family tree and relax AKC standards so that a dog can be considered a pug and not have to struggle for breath everyday for the rest of their lives.\n\nTl;dr \"Reputable\" breeders already try to make the breed healthier from within, but they're not willing to go against the AKC standards or cross-breed. Which is what some breeds desperately need.",

My parents' oldest dog still has his testicles and they are forever milimetres from the ground when he's standing up. He is very unhealthy with his skin and ears, and it's quite sad to look at him because he's declined mentally as well as physically. As these dogs age they droop even more which causes all sorts of problems, especially if they are overweight (and they do get fat very easily). It's hard for them to run around and they catch their ears under their paws quite often even as puppies. My Labrador puppy was trying to play with one of the bassets and he tore his ear by accident because it was just so long. \n\nBreeding for dog shows is cruelty. I asked my dad why they won't get a healthier dog and he said 'but they're *mutts*'. It's all about prestige and showing off to other people, never about the dog's wellbeing.",

On top of this, I'd like to add that some of these dogs are so severly affected, we end up having to do surgery to correct problems that should never have been allowed to happen in the first place. Widening the nostrils, trimming back an overlong soft palate, sometimes removing the tonsils just to give the dog more room back there to breath with.\n\n\nHowever this is pretty expensive stuff, and convincing owners that their pet would benefit from this can be a real challenge. Sometimes a dog will come in sounding like a chainsaw, awful flat face, tiny nostrils, the works, and all you get is \"he's a pug/bulldog/whatever, they are supposed to sound like that\". No madam, I can assure you that no creature just trying to breath is \"supposed\" to sound like that...\n\nEdit: spelling",

Of course all the girls in our year, including me, wanted to see this cute puppy so one day she asked her Mum to bring it with her when she was picked up from school. And the dog was very sweet and friendly, don't get me wrong, but I remember this classmate talking about her \"cute snuffles\" when the dog started breathing slightly heavier than usual from excitement and thirteen year old me thinking \"....are dogs *supposed* to sound like that?\" because I'd never owned one. I shrugged it off because of that (and because we were all kids it had of course never crossed our mind to think that someone would be awful enough to deliberately breed dogs that would be born sick), though when I was older I discovered what an ethical nightmare the breed was. I have no ill will against this classmate because she was a child when this happened, but I am genuinely confused as to how a grown adult can hear that Darth Vader sound and think it is cute, not a sign of a major health issue.",

I found this amazing organization called Puppy Rescue Mission that has been working to bring dogs that servicemembers bond with back to the US from other countries for years now. \n \nI contacted their organization and sent them a picture of the dog and where it was, and they showed up the very next day and picked her up and took care of everything. Shots, quarantine, vaccinations, getting her spayed, and all the paperwork required to legally get her to the US. A month later they called me up and told me the day she would be at the airport ready to pick up.  \n \nOn top of that, they are always fundraising and gathering donations so the people who adopt barely have to pay out of pocket - the process can cost anywhere from $3k-$7k, but they cover nearly everything and only charge $500 out of pocket, which is less than it costs to adopt from most shelters around me. \n \nI've been donating to them regularly since they helped me out and have Amazon Smile set to donate to them as well, they really are an incredible organization. Every now and then they need foster families or escorts/drivers for dogs that make it to the US but need to travel a little farther to their family.",

The main issue is that it really doesn't present itself until the dog is fully grown (2 to 2.5 years) and GSDs can start reproducing as young as 9 months. So Trailer Park Tammy is cranking out litters  asap to sell on Craigslist and spreading a harmful genetic deformity.\n\nGerman Shepherds are amazing dogs and if you're interested in getting one, please make sure you're able to check out the parents. Make sure they are both at least 2 years old, and don't have the stupid back slope and fucked up stumpy hind legs.",

Shame on you, people who breed dogs dogs that can\u2019t breathe properly, or give birth properly because of enlarged heads for that matter. \n\nFor people who buy them, they can\u2019t breathe for fucks sake. It\u2019s not cute, it\u2019s cruel.",

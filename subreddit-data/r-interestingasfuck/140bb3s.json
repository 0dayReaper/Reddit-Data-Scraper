But science grew as it will even with you protesting. \n\nI agree I could not do these kind of things. But I\u2019m not going to act like I\u2019m not reaping the benefits like everyone else. At some point we have to remember that morals etc is a human concept and we apply it DESPITE there being no evidence that reinforces this aside from us. Humans are the only \u201cgood\u201d thing in this world. Because we literally created good. \n\nThe monkey in question was only in there for the experiment and got plenty of grapes after we learned what we wanted. And it most likely lives and eats healthier than you. So don\u2019t worry, you are the neglected one.",

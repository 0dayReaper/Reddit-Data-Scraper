He's still waiting for guests at his time traveler party, after-all.\n\nI always found that experiment to be flawed from the start because he assumes that he'll be remembered far into the distant future. If we discover time travel 10,000 years from now, there's a high chance he may not be remembered at all. He also assumes that a time traveler would want to hang out with effectively a caveman compared to themselves and not someone more interesting or important later in human history. Lastly he assumes humanity will be around long enough to discover time travel. It was a cool experiment but I always hated when people claimed he proved time travel is impossible. All he proved is that a time traveler will never show up to his party, there's just too many assumptions involved for it to be evidence of anything other than that.",

But Stephen thought that black holes aren't just take, take, take. They could give something back - tiny bits of light that we can't see, but we call it \"Hawking Radiation\". This was a new idea and made lots of other scientists think about space differently. And even though he got very sick and couldn't move much, he didn't stop working. That shows us that we can do great things no matter what problems we face.",

The galaxy though would still be around. The Milky Way is over 10 billion years old and is chock full of stars that will burn for billions of years more. \n\nAny red dwarfs in that galaxy are still alive and some of the yellow dwarfs will be too. Red dwarfs last around 10 trillion years so they are still babies.",

Probably only a few days old. According to the park rangers that was a rare sighting.",

She leapt 12 feet high to swipe the guy with her claws, almost taking 3 of his fingers clean off, and she also sank her fangs into his stomach. All in the span of less than a second. She is a badass. She was also mad the wildlife folks had taken her cubs. They were trying to sedate her to move her elsewhere since she was suspected of killing cattle in that area. I hope she got rehomed safe and sound.",

It surely requires a lot of patience and a lot of water but when cranked up to 250bar or 3600psi it is more than capable of going through the pipe. Once it has gone through you attach the steel cable/chain and pull it back with the hydraulic winch and the you can attach the tire and do the cleaning.",

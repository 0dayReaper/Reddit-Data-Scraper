If you want to sell fruit(or really, any produce) through grocery stores, you suddenly need to account for a number of things:\n- Time spent in transport\n- Time spent in store\n- How long your product lasts once bought\n- Aesthetics of your product\n\nWhen people go grocery shopping, they expect to be able to store their produce for a little while AND want it looking fabulous. If your berries have been sitting in transport and the store for a couple days, they still have to look good AND last a few more days at home.\nSo the product has been selectively bred to grow extra big and beautiful instead of focussing on taste(because taste doesn't matter if everyone buys your competitor's nicer looking fruit), AND gets harvested early - this allows the product to spend a couple days ripening whilst in transport/store and thus prevents it from being overripe once bought. However, this means you often lack sugars in the product.\n\nThe last part is probably the most important one for taste - fruit will always be tastier fresh off the bush, simply because it has actually got the chance to ripen properly",

Giant pumpkins have been selected for larger than normal phloem (sugar delivery), and the growers add mycorrhizal fungi which help the roots move water and nutrients.\n\n###[The Secret to Growing the World\u2019s Largest Pumpkin](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/surprising-science-giant-pumpkins-180957099/)  \n**From special seeds to helpful fungi, creating a monster takes more than just sunlight and soil**  \n*Maya Wei-Haas, Smithsonian Magazine, October 30, 2015*\n\nWaiting in line for their weigh-in, the lumpy, pale pumpkins sag on their pallets like deflated balloons. But to become a world heavyweight champion, looks don\u2019t really matter. When it comes to this competition, decades of intense selective breeding have banished the petite, perfectly ovoid and brilliantly orange fruits with a focus on one exclusive trait: massive size.\n\nEvery year, an international community of giant-pumpkin farmers loads up beastly gourds on trailers, carting them to local fairs and weigh-ins for a chance at the title.\n\nThe size of these pumpkins is unimaginably large to me\u2014I can barely grow tomatoes without making heart-breaking tears through their delicate flesh, innards dripping to the ground. So I went to scientists and competitive pumpkin growers to ask this burning question: How do you make a monster pumpkin?\n\nThe current world record is held by Beni Meier, a Swiss accountant by day, who grew a pumpkin that weighs in at 2,323.7 pounds, roughly the same amount as a small car. But it\u2019s likely he won\u2019t hold that title long. These giants have been growing in mass by leaps and bounds every year, and there are no signs that they\u2019re slowing down.\n\n\u201cThe weight is still continuing to go up ... 1,000 pounds was the goal 15 years ago, and everyone thought that was unheard of,\u201d says Woody Lancaster, a competitive pumpkin grower and so-called heavy hitter, or someone who consistently churns out monsters. His 1,954-pounder ranked 14th in the world this year. \n\nAccording to Lancaster and other growers, there are a few basic tenants to cultivating giant pumpkins: Keep them at the perfect temperature, give them continuous food and water, protect their delicate skins from drying and cracking and cover them at night for warmth. Competitive growers also lovingly prune their pumpkin plants, reducing their fruit to a few prized gems. But above all, you have to start with a champion seed.\n\nGeorge Hamilton, extension field specialist in fruits and vegetables at the University of New Hampshire, ranks the relative importance of a grower's checklist something like this: \u201cNumber one is genetics, number two is genetics, number three is genetics. And then number four you\u2019ve got sun, warmth, fertilizer and water,\u201d he says.\n\nThese days, nearly every prizewinning pumpkin can trace its roots back to Howard Dill\u2019s Atlantic Giant. Dill spent 30 careful years cultivating his beasts from the Mammoth pumpkin varieties, which are rooted in the squash species Cucurbita maxima.\n\nIn 1981, Dill scored a world record with a 493.5-pound beast, trampling the previous record of 460 pounds. He patented the seeds, and an international cohort of growers continued to selectively breed them for bigger pumpkins.\n\nJust under 35 years later, the weight record for the pumpkins has more than quadrupled.\n\n\"Basically it's like horse racing. We\u2019re breeding big pumpkins into big pumpkins every year to create bigger pumpkins,\" says Ron Wallace, another heavy hitter who holds multiple growing titles. Last week, Wallace broke the North American weight record with his 2,230-pound behemoth.\n\nThe Secret to Growing the World's Largest Pumpkin\n\nSo why can these monsters grow so large? Atlantic Giant pumpkins can pack on close to 50 pounds a day during peak growing season, says plant physiologist Jessica Savage at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University. Though a pumpkin is roughly 90 percent water, there is still a great deal of sugar flowing into the plant\u2019s bulk.\n\nOddly enough, the giant plants aren\u2019t any better at producing sugar than their regular-sized cousins, explains Savage. They\u2019re just better at moving it around.\n\nTo take you back to high school biology, plants have two types of tissue that work to get food and water flowing through them: xylem and phloem. The xylem transports water into the plants, and the phloem is responsible for sugar movement. **While all pumpkins easily move large amounts of water, Savage found that giant pumpkins have supersized phloem.**\n\n**Growers have also harnessed the power of mycorrhizal fungi, which happily colonize the plant\u2019s roots and assist water and nutrients flowing into the plant in exchange for carbohydrates,** explains Wallace, who originally introduced the fungi to extreme gardeners. With increasing demand for his special fungi-containing elixirs, Wallace started selling the mixes this past February, and business is booming.\n\nSo is there a biological factor that will eventually limit their size?\n\nNot really. These monsters are so good at moving sugars, that given the proper conditions, there isn't anything glaring that limits their growth, says Savage. \"It seems like everything in the plant just increased with the fruit size.\"\n\nAnother grower, Matt DeBacco, suggests that the limit may be in the cells. Plants get large in two stages. First they divide and multiply their cells, then the cells begin expanding. Each individual cell can expand up to a thousand times its original size, so if the pumpkin has more cells to start with, it can expand much faster in the late season, when growth often becomes sluggish, DeBacco explains.\n\nDeBacco, dubbed \u201cmad scientist Matt\u201d by his local community, is currently tinkering with a brew of hormones and amino acids to prolong the initial period of cell growth. Already his method has produced gourds estimated to weigh over 2,000 pounds, and he thinks there may still be room for some tinkering.\n\n\u201cI think that is the last thing that we try before we actually sequence them and change the G\u2019s, the A\u2019s, the T\u2019s and the C\u2019s,\u201d says DeBacco, referring to the chemical base pairs that make up DNA.\n\nIn the end, the limit may come down to physics. Giant pumpkins already sag under their own weight, developing heart-wrenching cracks if they grow too quickly or unevenly. But the sagging may actually be one of the keys to continued growth, according to researched published in the International Journal of Non-Linear Mechanics.\n\nLead author David Hu and his team used vices to test how much force some ill-fated pumpkins could withstand. They discovered that round pumpkins could put up with a lot. Based on these tests, they estimated that a perfectly uniform pumpkin could grow up to a whopping 20,000 pounds. As the pumpkins flatten, things get more complicated, but flattening does seem to help the gourds hold up their massive bulk without cracking.\n\nSo although we might not ever have pumpkins big enough to serve as chariots, we already have some large enough for boat rides, and maybe they\u2019ll keep expanding horizontally. The extreme gardeners will just have to go on growing their massive gourds to find out.",

Exponential growth.\n\nThis makes sense and fits with your first description: some number of cells are dividing every day and being filled with water to supply the growth. For 49lb to be added to a 700lb fruit, only 7% of the cells need to divide in a given day. Or put another way, every cell in the fruit divides once every 14.29 days; a perfectly reasonable and continuable rate as long as the plant is given plenty of water and fertilizer.",

Usually the cells rise in a straight column and pop on the surface, but when you see the cells start to form a swirling pattern like this it means the nucleation site is growing. There is nothing that can be done at this point to stop a chain reaction from building, until eventually the pumpkin will come under so much pressure that it will fracture.

And they need strong, direct sunlight at least 6hrs a day. They also have a pretty shallow root system that stays mostly in the top 8\"  (~20cm) of surface soil. All of that means that the surface soil dries out pretty quickly. So when you water the pumpkins, it's like a monster whispering ***FEED MEEE*** and you can hear a noise around the roots--- realistically it's because the soil surrounding the root system is much dryer (because the pumpkins drank everything) and you're hearing water percolate into the parched area. It makes a snap/crackle/pop rumbly noise but isn't actually the pumpkins themselves. Anyway since the sound isn't distributed equally across a garden, just right next to the buried roots, people have told me they could hear the pumpkins \"drinking\" when I water them. \n\nMind you the pumpkins I have are much, much smaller than this one.",

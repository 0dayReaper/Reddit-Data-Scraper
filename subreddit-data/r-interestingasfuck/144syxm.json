It is yet another premeditated act of genocide against the Ukrainian people committed by russia. Not letting anyone escape the flooded areas (except for the members of the occupational \"administration\") proves that the true purpose of this terrorist act was to kill as many Ukrainian people as possible by drowning them alive. And there are already numerous reports of many people, predominantly elderly, drowning and their bodies seen floating in the stream.\n\nMoreover, russians started shelling the rescue operations in the city of Kherson, that is not occupied, the very next day after the dam explosion. Several people are already reported killed and many others injured.\n\nAnd in occupied town of Nova Kakhovka on the left bank, many people have been kidnapped by russians since the start of the invasion for their pro-Ukrainian position; they have been held in basements in the town. It is highly unlikely that russians freed them after the flood started which means they all drowned alive since water reaches basements of buildings first.",

Not definitive and wont be until long after this war But i can believe what i feel is most likely under a hypothesis, using an educated guess given the info we know. And in this case seems pretty obvious.\n\n Also racist how exactly?... At what point did i mention race once?... \n\nIn terms of evidence so far we have alot to go on. Firstly and most important, the dam fell on the side under russian control. Whether it was done deliberately or just through negligence, its their control its their responsibility.\n\nSecondly, the Ukrainian side had no bridge access. meaning that if it was planted explosives, as has been not only speculated but mentioned by russian forces in communications with eachother, then its next to impossible for ukraine to have snuck across the broken dam and planted the amount of explosives needed for the detonation.\n\nThirdly, I severely doubt that Ukraine would demolish its own damn and subsequently flood entire cities under its control... That just doesn't add up. The potential for loss of western support for doing so alone would make it highly unlikely that they would do such a thing.\n\nFourth, its not that far of a stretch to believe that russia would do this either intentionally or through incompetence, to either delay the ukrainian assault in the region, or in an attempt to flood a smaller area of defences, lost control of the flooding, and all hell broke loose. The russian armed forces continually through this war have demonstrated their ability to act in incompetence.\n\nTheres more i could harp on about here, but to suggest that im somehow racist, that theres not enough evidence to pin russia at fault, and that somehow im clearly gonna pin an innocent person in a trial without deliberating on all available evidence is pretty disingenuous and assuming alot. \n\nBut I hope you found entertainment at the very least by turning to personal namecalling rather than an actual discussion or respectful disagreement :)",

The fact that it is blown changes lots of their plans. It is more beneficial, because the flood hides the fact of corruption(russians had to build a defence line but now they can say that it was destroyed by the flood and retreat). But there were lots of russian troops on the left bank of the river, which is lower, so there is a chance there are lots of casualties. We well know that russia does not cares about casualties, so chances russia doing it are very high. I believe it was natural causes, because of lack of maintenance (Russia is responsible for it).",

They are just liberating regions that their people are being oppressed in and if you just gave them the land they claim is theirs  they Pinky promise not to invade again at a later date./s\n\nSeriously Russia demanded USSR nukes back and in return they would protect Ukraine. So Ukraine did. Then Russia takes Crimea and again Ukraine capitulated on the promise of peace. Then Russia again claims those other regions of Ukraine are also part of Russia and finally Ukraine finally said enough and finally fought back. Then Russia relentlessly bombed all of Ukraine instead of you know just defending the areas they came to liberate. Russia killing hundreds of civilians and dumping them in mass graves was to protect the Russian speaking areas, right?\n\nBecause it was totally only about protecting the Russian speaking regions and not that Ukraine has been politically moving closer to western Europe. Or because they elected someone who wasn't a Russian sycophant. And totally not because Ukraine recently found large amounts of oil and natural gas off the coast and in those Russian speaking areas that if exploited would hurt Russian oil markets.\n\nNo all these innocent people are dying because America wants to stick it to those damn russkies and have a good old proxy war, like the good old days.",

            "comment": "On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may have the appearance of increasing Reddit's traffic and revenue... but in the long term, it will undermine the site as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep its platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to populate its numerous communities with content. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools (which Reddit has frequently promised and then failed to deliver), moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either, and without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit \u2013 the foundations that draw its audience \u2013 will be eliminated, reducing the site to another dead cog in [the Ennui Engine](https://medium.com/@max.p.schlienger/the-cargo-cult-of-the-ennui-engine-890c541cebcb).\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not posture for your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. Focus on addressing Reddit's real problems \u2013 the rampant bigotry, the ever-increasing amounts of spam, the advantage given to low-effort content, and the widespread misinformation \u2013 instead of on a strategy that will alienate the people keeping this platform alive.\n\nIf Steve Huffman's statement \u2013 \"I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users\" \u2013 is to be taken seriously, then consider this our vote: \n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.",

Along with better mod tools and just an overall better user experience for a lot of people.  They just wanna kill these major apps. I get charging the apps but 20 million lol. That\u2019s not a legit offer and is just being used to shut them down.  What\u2019s hilarious is those 3rd party apps helped build Reddit in thr early days. Hell, they didn\u2019t have an official app till 2016. So for the first 4 years I was on Reddit I had to use a 3rd party app.",

There is no algorithm, reddit essentially brings nothing to the table except the initial website (which was perfected more than a decade ago pretty much) and some servers.\n\nPlatforms like youtube have full time moderators, thousands of them. They pay billions to their creators, they have all this shit set up. Reddit is just running ads on a forum and now decides they should make loads of money on it. It's like Twitter but even more so. They don't provide content. They don't do the moderation. They don't curate content or suggest it. They don't create the forums or post the comments.

This is. You and me. The users of the site essentially run every single part of reddit outside of the base technical stuff.\n\nIn the end Reddit is just a forum. A simple forum. Over time as people have tried to milk this forum for money the company has bloated itself up to 2000 employees, added a bunch of features to make money or make it an actual product, none of which have really changed the fact that it's just a forum. And now they want to sell ads on everything so a bunch of silicon valley bros can cash out with their IPO by claiming profitability.\n\nif Reddit was like \"hey guys we gotta cover server costs and basic upkeep and so on\" and they added maybe some donation system or discussed with the community how to achieve that (like many other websites do) that would be fine.",

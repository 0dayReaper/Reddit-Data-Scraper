I can\u2019t figure out exactly through whom they were connected, but this is good enough for me, and I don\u2019t have more time to look right now anyway.\n\nEdit: Upon more reflection, I realized that maybe they aren\u2019t directly related. A cousin of a cousin could only be related through marriage, not through blood. It depends on how the connection is made via the connecting \u201cmiddle\u201d cousin of the three of them. Still, they are related through at most one marriage.",

                                                    "comment": "Late war Lincoln looked like he aged 20 years. The poor dude had to deal with his son dying, his wife basically going insane due to the death, handle a country who's political system had broken down so much that it had started a war, and fight a war that very few of his own people wished to fight. Oh, and somehow win an election when the country was so polarized they were shooting each other over it. \n\nPeople don't realize just how much of a badass Lincoln was. It wasn't just that he helped lead the country through a civil war. It's that he did that while his family was falling apart, most of the people under him were incompetent (looking at you, McClellan) and a ton of other craziness going on. You can see in the pictures him physically aging due to the stress. People make jokes about how Obama looked way older after his presidency, but it's nothing compared to poor Abe. \n\nAfter the war, he was super excited about being a peacetime president. He was looking forwards to finally being able to relax, and not have to bear the responsibility for thousands of young men dying in a day. Even his wife was in pretty good spirits, they finally felt like they had reached the end of the tunnel, and could see the light. They decided to go see a play, just to relax, they were laughing and cheerful for the first time in what felt like a decade... Then Booth shot him in the head. \n\nIf you want to check out pre-war Lincoln, look at his Cooper Union speech. It's like an hour and a half, so if you want you can just read the highlights, but it is really powerful. Then compare it to the Gettysburg address. Looking between the two, you can almost read the weariness, the exhaustion, but also the resolve of the dude. I really don't like \"great man history\", where people say one guy, usually a President or King, was solely responsible for winning a war, but in the case of Lincoln, he certainly came close.\n\nAnother reason to check out the Cooper Union speech was because it was full abolitionist Lincoln, no holds barred. He absolutely slaughtered Southern Democrats. Once he became president, he had to tone down his abolitionism, since several slave states sided with the north but could easily switch. It's why even the emancipation proclamation didn't abolish slavery, it just freed southern slaves. It was sold to the northern slave states as \"it's encouraging southern slaves to aid the North in return for freedom, it will end the war quicker!\" \n\nProbably my favorite part of his Cooper Union speech was him breaking apart the South's argument that it was abolitionists that were going to cause a civil war by forcing the South to leave. He used the analogy of a highwayman (a bandit) and said it's like if a bandit held a gun to your head, and said \"Don't become a murderer!\"\n\nHe was pretty merciless for the whole speech, like pointing out how they only followed the constitution when it benefitted them, how there was no part of the constitution which banned abolition, and how ironic it is that they called abolitionist Republicans radicals while actively seeking to leave their own country. Lincoln, chill dude, I almost feel bad for the slave-owners!",

What we think of as a British accent didn\u2019t come into play until the latter half of the 1800s. But the interesting thing is that we have writings from English travelers remarking on the accents of colonial Americans which note that they spoke with a uniquely uniform accent whose point of origin was hard to pin down, whereas it was easy to tell exactly which part of the English isles a British person was from.",

That's kind of ironic thinking about how in almost every movie set in the medieval period through the 1700s everyone tends to do a modern British accent. But occasionally they'll have an American actor that doesn't bother doing an accent and they usually get lambasted for it. As it turns out that is actually closer to being accurate then.",

An anecdote!!\n\n&gt; During the Constitutional Convention in 1787, two of Washington's superlative young proteges, Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris, argued over Washington's aloofness. Hamilton bet Morris dinner and wine for a dozen people that Morris could not--even at a social drinking party--rest an arm on Washington's shoulders in an informal greeting without being rebuked by the great general.\n\n&gt; Morris walked up to Washington, bowed, shook hands, and then placed his left hand on Washington's shoulder and said, `My dear General, I am very happy to see you look so well.' The response was immediate and icy. Washington reached up, removed the hand, stepped back, and fixed his eyes in silence on Morris, until Morris retreated into the crowd. The company looked on in dismay, and no one ever tried it again.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports that Hamilton paid for the bet even though he had won because he didn't think the result would be so mortifying.",

A meeting of officers was held to determine the next steps, and Washington surprised them by showing up:\n\n&gt;Washington then gave a short but impassioned speech, now known as the Newburgh Address, counseling patience. His message was that they should oppose anyone \"who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood.\" He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said:\n\n&gt;\"Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country.\"\n\n&gt;This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. \n\nVia [wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newburgh_Conspiracy)",

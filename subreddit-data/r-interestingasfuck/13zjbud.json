And once you've adopted a technology, it's somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible to go back to the way it was before because of the changes you had to make to adopt the new tech. So they like to really take their time judging each new technology. For example they are all about using electric lights for safety, and as far as I know are completely fine with modern hospitals. Plumbing is another thing they like, but they don't see the necessity of cars since there are alternatives that have wayyyy less impact on the way they live their lives. Yet we can't abandon cars since we built out entire infrastructure around their use, despite the negative costs like crashes, roadkill and massive space requirements. I don't agree with their conclusions in general, but I agree that they are asking necessary questions.",

But the various Amish groups accept technologies that make them more productive and generally spurn ones that can disrupt the family dynamic or make them dependent on it. For instance, farmers selling directly to English clients (English being their word for non-Amish people) sometimes have flip phones and small trucks so that clients can call them and arrange deliveries. Home phones are also sometimes permitted for similar reasons, but only if they're mounted on telephone poles outside.",

Not to mention he absolutely loves to fuck with people online, because it gets him more views.\n\nI remember being in my 20\u2019s when Obama was in office and I thought he was practically satan because that\u2019s what the news and locals were saying. Now I look back and realize how insanely stupid I was. He was young enough to not be decrepit as fuck, yet also old enough to have a little bit of wisdom. Looking at the ages of other recent presidents\u2026what in the fuck are we doing?",

Often larger wheels have thinner tires, and the combined diameter is the same as small wheel with thicker tire. (Simplified, its the amount of air inside that changes, tire is still similar thickness). Also your cars wheel wells are the same size, so your wheel+tire diameter cannot grow that much or they wouldnt fit in there anymore or would bottom out on bumps.",

Struts and shocks primarily, which are designed for compression to only.  Struts are attached with three studs through the frame, not meant to take a quarter of the cars weight in tension.  And the shocks and struts are not structural designed for that amount of tension load.  All the springs are compression devices and thus not bearing the weight of the car, as is it\u2019s design intent.  A little bit of inertia from hitting a bump and the shock/struts would come apart, which are the only things actually bearing the weight of the rest of the car.",

In that case all the tension load could be placed on rigid members. Would probably be inferior in terms of stability, but doesn't require too much reworking of the supply chain.",

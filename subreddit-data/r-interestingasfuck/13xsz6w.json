I do not mean wonderful in the common casual sense as a synonym for good/cool/nice/etc \n\nThe Aztecs achieved a lot in their empire, with many advancements relative to the place and time. They had fairly advanced agriculture, and amazing utility of lakes. Seen above, they also had great works of architecture. They were a civilization that achieved *wonders*. Hence *wonderful*. The human sacrifice practiced by their culture remains barbaric and cruel, no doubt. But it\u2019s not factoring into it. \n\nLike how you could point to FDR as a \u201cgreat\u201d American President. It doesn\u2019t mean that he was great and good in all things and all ways. His legacy is tempered by his downfalls (internment camps, notably), but will likely remain a historic great due to his positives (public works, wartime leadership, 4 term popularity etc)",

Even if it took four days, as another comment claims, that would be one heart every four seconds. I don\u2019t care how expert the priests were at cutting out hearts, it had to take more than 1-4 seconds! \n\nIf we allow that more than one priest was cutting out hearts at a time, and it took them just a minute per heart (generous given the need to cut through the skin, sternum, and peritoneum), it would\u2019ve required 60 priests doing nothing but cutting out hearts around the clock. If we assume even the most fervent priest couldn\u2019t cut out hearts for more than eight hours in a stretch without a break, that\u2019s 180 priests working in 8 hour shifts cutting out hearts at a rate of one per minute. \n\nBut 8 hours of sawing through bone would likely wear out even the most in-shape priest, not to mention their stone knives. More likely there were 360 or 720 priests working in four or two hour shifts respectively. And if we asume a more realistic time of two minutes per heart, those numbers add up to 1440 priests working at breakneck pace snatching out a heart every two minutes. \n\nEven we accept this number of priests as realistic (which I don\u2019t), the fact remains that their obsidian knives likely couldn\u2019t saw through more than two or three sternums without becoming dull to the point of uselessness. That means this \u201cday of 84000 sacrifices\u201d would have required at a minimum 28000 hand-knapped obsidian knives, an output that even an industrialized civilization would find difficult to achieve. Given the estimated 300000 inhabitants of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, one-fourth of the male population  must\u2019ve been devoted to nothing but making knives for cutting out hearts, a waste of human output I find impossible to believe took place while also building such impressive temples, canals, homes, works of art, and raising food and livestock. \n\nAfter crunching the numbers, I find it much easier to believe that the \u201c84000 hearts cut out in one day\u201d story is simply propaganda spread by the conquistadors in an effort to justify their decimation of the Aztec empire. Could a nation that spent all its time making  knives to cut out hearts also have engineered and built such a spectacular and functional city in a lake? I don\u2019t think so.",

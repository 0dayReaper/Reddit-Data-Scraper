They are technically edible, but have two main problems: quality- hermit crabs are scavengers, and a significant portion of their diet is made up of dead animals, which can show up in their flesh; quantity- hermit crabs are pretty small, and you don\u2019t get much meat for the trouble of removing all of their tough carapace.",

You\u2019re just saying that for a fact it is an art piece and art doesn\u2019t mean you follow the rules of a house contractor. It means you create and express a point, skill, or invoke thought. There\u2019s many reasons why an artist might not want to fill it with some ugly clear plastic. One of which is to truly show its depth to project the image of a reversed rug. As you\u2019ve stated multiple times, nobody is going to walk on it. Keeping it natural makes it look more like a rug left an imprint on the wood. Ugh I can go on but it\u2019s like speaking to a bunch of cucks who get a hard on from staring at construction sites.",

For materials, the most expensive part would be the resin which might be a few hundred dollars assuming they're using high quality resin. \n\nThe biggest cost would be the artist themselves. What you would be paying for is their skill and time. The materials would just be a footnote.  With that in mind, you'd get what you pay for. Spend more money, get a better artist, better finished product. Spend less money, artist may not be as good, you get something that looks like a highschooler did it. \n\nWhen it comes to art, the biggest cost is the artist, not the materials. For this reason, and this reason alone, no one here can reasonably give you a cost estimate unless they're an artist giving you a quote, and even then the quotes will vary.",

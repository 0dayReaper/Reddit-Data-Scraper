It takes some getting used to. But I\u2019ve never been more protected\n\nFell down the stairs, nothing \ud83d\ude03 got hit by a car while crossing, nothing \ud83d\ude06 I only got pushed across the surface, but I was still standing. It was time for more danger. I went to a spot where there is a lot of shootings and mugging. I was held up, I have to admit I was scared but stood my ground. The mugger said \u201csir can I please have your wallet! Sir, sir please your wallet. Don\u2019t make me shoot you.. sir?\u2026\u201d\n\nI just stood there waiting to see what would happen. He raised his piece and emptied the clip on me. Nothing! It was amazing \ud83e\udd29 I could hear the bullets landing at me feet as they were blocked by my new armor \ud83d\ude0e \n\nThe mugger said sorry and started to pick up his used bullets. Which led me to believe he was broke and needed to reuse them. So I told him it\u2019s fine and gave him a twenty bill. We high five\u2019ed as we parted ways. Saw him some time later, shopping with his family. We gave each other a nod. Now I only wear my armor when going out. I even made a formal wear, where you can\u2019t see the ice \ud83e\uddca packs at all. Saved me later, at a Mexican wedding. But that\u2019s a mother story. Hope this helps",

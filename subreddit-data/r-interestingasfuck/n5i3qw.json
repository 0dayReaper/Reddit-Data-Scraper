Considering Lincoln's primary goal was about reconstruction and reintegration of the South and all of it's people, including freed slaves, into the Union. Surprisingly Grant was the only one to at least try to follow through on this. Everyone after him just sort of gave up or rather turned a blind eye to what was happening.\n\nHad Lincoln either not gone to the play, assuming Booth would either give up or gotten arrested for conspiring to assassinate the President, or simply survived a non-crippling shot he would have been a powerful voice in who gets nominated for future presidential candidates. Also assuming his health didn't take a rapid decline post presidency.\n\nOr it could've happened the exact same way, just with a surviving Lincoln. That's what's weird about possible alternate time lines we just couldn't possibly know what any future repercussions past like 10-20 years would be.",

                            "comment": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Abraham Lincoln\u2019s face is iconic \u2013 we recognize him instantly. But what did he really look like? Our understanding of his appearance is based on grainy, black and white photos from well over a century ago. Antique photos provide a fascinating glimpse of the distant past. However, they also depict a faded, monochromatic world very different from what people at the time experienced. Old photos distort appearance in other less obvious ways. ***For example, the film of Lincoln\u2019s era was sensitive only to blue and UV light, causing cheeks to appear dark, and overly emphasizing wrinkles*** by filtering out skin subsurface scatter which occurs mostly in the red channel. Hence, the deep lines and sharp creases that we associate with Lincoln\u2019s face (Figure 1) are likely exaggerated by the photographic process of the time.\n\n [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12261.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12261.pdf)",

As somebody who has just finished watching Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal in Lincoln, I am so damn interested in this man. I was never previously a presidential history nut but I've found myself getting more and more into the classics. For example, I remember reading about the fascinating private live of President James Buchanan and his penchant for taking long hikes with his pet dog. I always wanted to find out more info but I misplaced the biography when I went out to the garage to beat seven shades of hell into my idiot son Roger with jumper cables. I'm loving these modern-day portraits of old Presidents - keep 'em coming!",

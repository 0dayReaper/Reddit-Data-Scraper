A large part of why we had such an excess was the anticipated casualties from a land invasion of Japan. American casualties were anticipated to be in the hundreds of thousands, Japan's casualties in the millions. \n\nIn all the wars and actions since, Korea, Vietnam, Middle East, we have not burned through that stockpile of medals.",

He had the chosen plan in his hands entirely and took the opportunity to end the war without compromise or reliance on a tricky ally.  \n\nAgain, the timeline has been provided to you with citations in the linked article.

So, you do care.  \n\nYou are utterly confused, apparently.  \n\nAnyhow, you still have not provided a reasonable alternative to dropping the bombs.  Your timeline of \"diplomacy\" is falsely stated and yet you continue to rely upon it.  And you stating the Russian Invasion is what ended the war is also false since that happened after Hiroshima, and then Japan decided to continue fighting after the Russian's declared war.  The tipping point was the two bombs.  \n\nI don't care if you believe it or not especially since nobody takes you seriously because you ignore the actual facts and do not provide any sources for your claims.",

My recollection is that his former commanding officer had to come to him and relieve him of duty for him to stop fighting. And I won't go into it here but, the absolute fanaticism, as you mentioned, of the Japanese military was unparalleled and fanatical to the extreme. To surrender or be captured was shameful and unacceptable and the suicide rates of those facing inevitable defeat were astronomical.",

Their argument was that bombing civilian populations was **more** humane, because it led to the war ending sooner due to overwhelming public outcries, and thus **less** death, destruction, and harm to everyone.  \n\nTurns out, this is wrong, as it doesn't matter to the leadership if you kill civilians in a fascist dictatorship, and when you attack civilians in a democracy, they tend to support payback and not forcing an end.  But the ideas behind their logic were at least seeking the right goals (less death, destruction, etc.).",

Self-Defense of yourself or others removes the shooting from \"evil,\" because if the act is morally justified, then it cannot be \"evil.\"\n\nObviously dropping the bomb was more complicated, but one thing most claim as being \"evil\" achieved the exact same result as firebombing.  So, leaving aside whether firebombing was \"evil\" (most likely a genuine debate) those arguing that dropping the bombs was \"evil\" often differentiate that from what other means were already being used to reduce cities to dust.  \n\nAs a result, we get a very unsatisfying debate that veers off from the actual issue of what other options were available and of all these options which one was best (with the most important component being minimizing death while ending the war).",

It's perfectly fine to fight back with whatever forces you have against someone who intends to genocide your whole race. By your logic, if people just surrender and let themselves be killed, there would be no wars.\n\n\"Anyone who agrees to wars get sent to the frontline\" Where do you think Japanese were doing in China back then?

Where all choices are going to result in significant collateral damage, the best choice is the one that renders the least damage.   So, even though the \"best\" choice would result in nuclear weapons killing civilians, that doesn't mean that people supporting that choice are happy about it.",

The Japanese dug miles of underground tunnels and booby traps and every single soldier was to fight until he had nothing left then die via suicide. Several of our guys died for each one of the Japanese soldiers. \n\nThe Japanese were preparing that exact same scenario for the mainland.

A nuclear bomb doesn't need to kill to get the message across (that's fanciful thinking I grant you)\n\nLastly, I apologise for seeming standoffish.

Yet, Japan publicly (and privately) maintained their position that Japan would fight to the last citizen.   \n\nSo, the US was put into a position of having a strong potential victory condition which could end the war in days (and even still, the second bomb was the last hope as there were no others at that time) under known conditions.  To not take that opportunity as presented raised the possibility of allowing the conditions to change, while the net effect of other options would result in the same (but likely far more) casualties and significantly more time and expense. \n\nIn sum, the possibility of the blockade being used as the means to end the war (btw, there was already a blockade in place) was considered, but rejected as it was simply too inefficient.",

In sum, Japan had given up on trying to surrender through Russia in July - PRIOR to Hiroshima and the invasion of Manchuria.\n\nYour entire premise is faulty.\n\n**Reaching out to Russia**\n\n&gt;On 30 June, T\u014dg\u014d told Naotake Sat\u014d, Japan's ambassador in Moscow, to try to establish \"firm and lasting relations of friendship.\" Sat\u014d was to discuss the status of Manchuria and \"any matter the Russians would like to bring up.\"\\[59\\] Well aware of the overall situation and cognizant of their promises to the Allies, the Soviets responded with delaying tactics to encourage the Japanese without promising anything. Sat\u014d finally met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov on 11 July, but without result. On 12 July,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;T\u014dg\u014d directed Sat\u014d to tell the Soviets that:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;His Majesty the Emperor, mindful of the fact that the present war daily brings greater evil and sacrifice upon the peoples of all the belligerent powers, desires from his heart that it may be quickly terminated. But so long as England and the United States insist upon unconditional surrender, the Japanese Empire has no alternative but to fight on with all its strength for the honor and existence of the Motherland.\\[60\\]\n\n...\n\n&gt;Sat\u014d advised T\u014dg\u014d that in reality, \"unconditional surrender or terms closely equivalent thereto\" was all that Japan could expect. Moreover, in response to Molotov's requests for specific proposals, Sat\u014d suggested that T\u014dg\u014d's messages were not \"clear about the views of the Government and the Military with regard to the termination of the war,\" thus questioning whether T\u014dg\u014d's initiative was supported by the key elements of Japan's power structure.\\[61\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On 17 July, T\u014dg\u014d responded:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Although the directing powers, and the government as well, are convinced that our war strength still can deliver considerable blows to the enemy, we are unable to feel absolutely secure peace of mind ... Please bear particularly in mind, however, that we are not seeking the Russians' mediation for anything like an unconditional surrender.\\[62\\]\n\n...\n\n&gt;On 21 July, speaking in the name of the cabinet, T\u014dg\u014d repeated:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With regard to unconditional surrender we are unable to consent to it under any circumstances whatever. ... It is in order to avoid such a state of affairs that we are seeking a peace, ... through the good offices of Russia. ... it would also be disadvantageous and impossible, from the standpoint of foreign and domestic considerations, to make an immediate declaration of specific terms.\\[64\\]\n\nHere, the prospects of negotiation were non-existent as Japan entered it prospective talks through Russia stating it would not accept \"unconditional surrender.\"  Russia did not even approach the US on Japan's behalf as it knew the US would not change its terms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Japan\u2019s Response to the Potsdam Declaration:**\n\n&gt;On 27 July, the Japanese government considered how to respond to the Declaration. The four military members of the Big Six wanted to reject it, but T\u014dg\u014d, acting under the mistaken impression that the Soviet government had no prior knowledge of its contents, persuaded the cabinet not to do so until he could get a reaction from Moscow.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next day, Japanese newspapers reported that the Declaration, the text of which had been broadcast and dropped by leaflet into Japan, had been rejected. In an attempt to manage public perception, Prime Minister Suzuki met with the press, and stated:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***I consider the Joint Proclamation a rehash of the Declaration at the Cairo Conference. As for the Government, it does not attach any important value to it at all. The only thing to do is just kill it with silence (mokusatsu). We will do nothing but press on to the bitter end to bring about a successful completion of the war.\\[78\\]***\n\nBy the close of July, Japan had not accepted the terms offered by the Potsdam Declaration, nor had they even reached out to the United States.  Nor had Russia reached on Japan's behalf.  Japan reiterates it will not unconditionally surrender and vows to see the war to the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Japan refuses to surrender following \u201cthe twin shocks\u201d of Hiroshima and the invasion of Manchuria.**\n\n&gt;These \"twin shocks\"\u2014the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the Soviet entry\u2014had immediate profound effects on Prime Minister Kantar\u014d Suzuki and Foreign Minister Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d, who concurred that the government must end the war at once.\\[94\\] However, the senior leadership of the Japanese Army took the news in stride, grossly underestimating the scale of the attack. With the support of Minister of War Anami, they started preparing to impose martial law on the nation, to stop anyone attempting to make peace.\\[95\\] Hirohito told Kido to \"quickly control the situation\" because \"the Soviet Union has declared war and today began hostilities against us.\"\\[96\\]\n\nSo, even after Hiroshima and Russia's invasion, Japan refused to surrender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**After Nagasaki and decision to surrender:**\n\n&gt;On August 9, 1945 after the bomb was dropped at Nagasaki:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The cabinet meeting adjourned at 17:30 with no consensus. A second meeting lasting from 18:00 to 22:00 also ended with no consensus. Following this second meeting, Suzuki and T\u014dg\u014d met the Emperor, and Suzuki proposed an impromptu Imperial conference, which started just before midnight on the night of 9\u201310 August.\\[103\\] Suzuki presented Anami's four-condition proposal as the consensus position of the Supreme Council. The other members of the Supreme Council spoke, as did Kiichir\u014d Hiranuma, the President of the Privy Council, who outlined Japan's inability to defend itself and also described the country's domestic problems, such as the shortage of food.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The cabinet debated, but again no consensus emerged. At around 02:00 (10 August), Suzuki finally addressed Emperor Hirohito, asking him to decide between the two positions. The participants later recollected that the Emperor stated:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I have given serious thought to the situation prevailing at home and abroad and have concluded that continuing the war can only mean destruction for the nation and prolongation of bloodshed and cruelty in the world. I cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer. ...*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I was told by those advocating a continuation of hostilities that by June new divisions would be in place in fortified positions \\[at Kuj\u016bkuri Beach, east of Tokyo\\] ready for the invader when he sought to land. It is now August and the fortifications still have not been completed. ...*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*There are those who say the key to national survival lies in a decisive battle in the homeland. The experiences of the past, however, show that there has always been a discrepancy between plans and performance. I do not believe that the discrepancy in the case of Kuj\u016bkuri can be rectified. Since this is also the shape of things, how can we repel the invaders? \\[He then made some specific reference to the increased destructiveness of the atomic bomb.\\]*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*It goes without saying that it is unbearable for me to see the brave and loyal fighting men of Japan disarmed. It is equally unbearable that others who have rendered me devoted service should now be punished as instigators of the war. Nevertheless, the time has come to bear the unbearable. ...*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I swallow my tears and give my sanction to the proposal to accept the Allied proclamation on the basis outlined by \\[T\u014dg\u014d,\\] the Foreign Minister.\\[104\\]*\n\nSo, it wasn't until the Nagasaki bomb was dropped did Japan decided to surrender - after many discussions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**After the War:  Japan claims it was seeking peace \u2013 this claim is rejected by many historians.**\n\n&gt;For the most part, Suzuki's military-dominated cabinet favored continuing the war. For the Japanese, surrender was unthinkable\u2014Japan had never been successfully invaded or lost a war in its history.\\[18\\] Only Mitsumasa Yonai, the Navy minister, was known to desire an early end to the war.\\[19\\] According to historian Richard B. Frank:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Although Suzuki might indeed have seen peace as a distant goal, he had no design to achieve it within any immediate time span or on terms acceptable to the Allies. His own comments at the conference of senior statesmen gave no hint that he favored any early cessation of the war ... Suzuki's selections for the most critical cabinet posts were, with one exception, not advocates of peace either.\\[20\\]***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After the war, Suzuki and others from his government and their apologists claimed they were secretly working towards peace, and could not publicly advocate it. They cite the Japanese concept of haragei\u2014\"the art of hidden and invisible technique\"\u2014to justify the dissonance between their public actions and alleged behind-the-scenes work. However, many historians reject this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Robert J. C. Butow wrote:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***Because of its very ambiguity, the plea of haragei invites the suspicion that in questions of politics and diplomacy a conscious reliance upon this 'art of bluff' may have constituted a purposeful deception predicated upon a desire to play both ends against the middle. While this judgment does not accord with the much-lauded character of Admiral Suzuki, the fact remains that from the moment he became Premier until the day he resigned no one could ever be quite sure of what Suzuki would do or say next.\\[21\\]***",

Atomic weapons then available lacked the power or numbers to kill by measures more than thousands.** Critics of how the war ended quote statements by Naval officers that the war could have been ended without atomic bombs. What the critics do not disclose is that this alternate means to end the war aimed to kill Japanese by the millions. Most prominently, Truman\u2019s chief of staff, Fleet Admiral William Leahy, post war would condemn atomic weapons as barbaric, though the only documented comment he ever made to Truman during the war was that the atomic bombs would not work.

This sentiment is influenced by 60 years of victor historytelling (written by the victor).\n\nThe atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki was a brutal war crime targetting civilian populations. It would be the equivalent of nuking Baghdad and Mosul in 2010.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that the two bombs were a major factor for the Japanese surrender. But, one that was coming with or without murdering over 200.000 civilians instantly. There is also a misconception about the timing of the surrender. It took Japan 6(!) days after the bombs to surrender and surely discussed many aspects of the surrender, besides the bombs.\n\nThere is also a lot to support the idea that the bombs were ill used and the show of power was (a) directed partly to show (ally!) the Sovjet Union what the USA was capable of both in terms of destruction as well as in terms of ruthlessness and (b) Japanese sources point to the inevitability of defeat caused by the Sovjet Union turning on Japan and the massive military losses with no means to rebuild these.\n\nIn the end most people want to make it a numbers game: \"if those bombs hadnt killed 225.000 Japanese, 1.000.000 Americans would have died invading the islands. The number that is repeated constantly here is \"one million americans\" as projected casualties but these assumed a worst case scenario with the war extending 2 or 3 more years and as such highely unlikely. About 50.000 casualties were expected in the rest if 1945 would the islands have to be invaded.\n\nNoone can predict with confidence what would have happened but I argue that the hopelessness of the Pacific theatre in july 1945 was sufficiently desperate to get Japan to surrender with agreeable terms from an allied point of view within year's end.",

Same just after Nagasaki, but then, after a series of discussions (each one, until the last reaffirming the commitment to fight to the last citizen) Japan finally decided to capitulate.\n\nThat is the basic timeline.\n\nAs for your other points, the \"numbers\" were not constructed after-the-fact, they were constantly being developed over years in anticipation of a final assault on the Japanese home islands.  The numbers started at around 500k and went up from there as new information was uncovered.  Those initial numbers did not take into account the significantly larger loss of Japanese citizenry.  This is why you see revisionists, like you, conflating the numbers of projected U.S. casualties v. total casualties \n\nFirebombing was already just as effective in wiping whole cities off the map.  So, using the conventional methods already employed was just as destructive as using the atomic bomb.\n\nYes, using the bomb had the collateral effect of providing warning to Russia, but at no time did the main intention waver from using the bomb as a means to end the war.\n\nYour last bit of speculation is just nonsense (which is evidenced by the fact you provide zero facts to support it).",

I mean, the whole reason for alternatives is because Japan was not going to capitulate from conventional bombing or even firebombing.  Right here, by this suggestion, it is obvious you have no knowledge of these events and are only arguing to argue.  \n4. Invasion.  Studied at length, assumed to be the only viable option before the atom bombs were developed.  Would have resulted in millions of civilian casualties.  Rejected due to the extreme cost in lives.  That you advocate for an invasion is just pure ignorance of the circumstances as it would have represented the WORST possible options.\n5. \"Lots of different options.\"  Meaning, no other options.\n6. Nuking is \"immoral.\"  Well, you argue for \"conventional bombing\" (assuming to mean status quo) and that was killing just as many people under arguably worse conditions as an entire city would catch fire and then burn over several hours.  So, again, you seem focused on the atom bomb as the actual issue - which is not really the issue here.  \n\nThanks for playing.  You basically justify your position by stating you are fine with multitudes more death and destruction as long as it is not done by \"nukes.\"  In sum, your position is utterly ridiculous and indefensible as you are putting priority on your own personal beliefs over the lives of millions.",

Then beyond that, you argue that an invasion was a better option when that would have caused far more civilian deaths.\n\nSo, for you, yeah, I dismiss your position as you are not actually debating the issue; you are just aimlessly attempting to pick apart the decision to reach your conclusion.\n\nYou have been replying without even addressing the cited passages I've provided.  So, obviously, you've hitna dead end and no path beyond arguing like a child. \n\nI don't have anymore time for you",

Struck by 19 American aerial torpedoes, it was sunk, drowning 2,498 of its crew.\n\nThat is just a basic comment about \"this day in history.\"  Beyond that, Yamato was already on a suicide mission and had grounded itself to operate as a \"permanent\" gun installment off the coast of Okinawa.  There simply was no threat remaining after that.\n\nThe sinking of Yamato was also hastened by the fact there was no air cover.  Yes, the Kamikazes were the biggest threat to the U.S. Navy, but otherwise, Japan had no functioning air force to support troops and defend from bombing raids.",

Because Japan would not accept unconditional surrender, that process went nowhere.\n3. In late July, Japan publicly rejected the Potsdam Declaration, again reiterating it would fight to the last person.\n4. Within hours of the Hiroshima bombing, Japan met and rejected accepting unconditional surrender.\n5. Within hours of the invasion of Manchuria, the government again rejected surrender and began making plans to implement its civil defense plan and declaring martial law.\n6. Within hours of the Nagasaki bombing, again, Japan was determined to fight on, but then a series of debates eventually resulted in the decision to surrender.\n\n\\- also, the possible death tally studies began years earlier and was updated to account for new information.  These studies were undertaken contemporaneously with the events in question - not after the bombs were dropped.  The low end of U.S. casualties that could reasonably be accepted was around 500k.  When adding the expected civilian casualties, the numbers climbed well over 1 million.\n\n\\- Okinawa was not an Island fortress, until it was.  Yes, islands such as Iwo Jima which served solely as military installations, were heavily fortified as it was always assumed they would be under attack.  Once it was clear Okinawa was going to be invaded, the Island was suitably prepared for defense.  Your assertion that the main islands would not be prepared for an invasion is intellectually dishonest as it ignores the fact Japan was already implementing defense plans.",

Nukes aren't used, the war ends, things in Japan would be different today since there would be no occupation, for better and worse. \n\nAgain, the nukes were a choice.

As explained in the linked post (which I posted in full in this thread, but you refuse to read), Japan was not willing to surrender unless it was under its own terms.  This was a non-starter and Japan acknowledged this internally thus the \"plan\" to negotiate a surrender went nowhere.  This was confirmed by Japan's public rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.\n2. Now you want to move the goal posts by saying Japan would have surrendered, just not under the terms demanded of them.  As explained, this was a non-starter.  The loser does not dictate the terms.  You are inviting facts into the analysis that simply did not exist.  ... \"After 4 years of war, if America would have just been in a more compromising mood, the whole war would have ended ... eventually, etc.\"  \n3. There was no negotiation.  Japan raised the prospect with Russia and Russia did not respond.  So, whatever Japan was seeking was not even presented to the U.S.  Japan, realized that it was a futile gesture anyway because THEY would not accept unconditional surrender which they knew was the only option.  This was confirmed by the Potsdam Declaration which offered no altered terms - just a reiteration of unconditional surrender.  Japan publicly rejected it.   Your entire premise is factually inaccurate. \n4. There was no dialogue, because Japan would not participate in a dialogue to begin with.  The U.S. very clearly and directly continued to warn Japan with words and actions that they were leading themselves to compete destruction, yet it still did not change its position until after Nagasaki.",

No.  Japan never approached the U.S. about a conditional surrender, nor did any other party do so on their behalf in June/July 1945.\n2. Yes.  That is what a \"surrender\" means.  However, a conditional surrender was never offered.\n3. U.S.  - there were very good reasons for that.\n4. U.S. \n5. No.  The target list was a list of cities.  Hiroshima and Nagaski were two of the remaining city targets which would have been reduced by other means, anyway.  Also, there were no identified targets that would have avoided civilian deaths given the scope of the weapon.\n\nAgain, this is not a grade-school debate.  Your continued efforts to twist the actual facts to frame the \"debate\" in your favor is laughable.  All the while I wonder why you don't actually read the cited timeline of events that explains all of these issues in their proper context relative to the decision to drop the bombs.  \n\nArguing historical events is not a word game.  There are actual facts you have to consider, and you refuse to incorporate even the most basic facts into your fantasy scenario.  \n\nFinally, the argument that dropping the bombs saved lives is that the choice resulted in less deaths than the alternatives ... namely an invasion.  You seem to be arguing that the use of the bombs could have been executed in a different manner that would result in less deaths.  That is a different point, entirely.  You also argue that there were better alternatives than using the bombs as the plan to end the war ... yet, you provide no reasonable alternative plan.  \n\nSee, that is the problem with trying to make this a \"word game.\"  If you are only trying to use trickery by misstating facts to attack what happened without actually offering a plan of your own, you are not really debating anything.",

You can't change that no matter what.  So, we know what happened after two bombs were dropped - Japan surrendered.  \n\nWhat did not happen was that Japan surrendered under any circumstances that did not include the dropping of the two bombs.  \n\nSo, you offered scenario did not happen as you state.  Instead, you would need to remove your claim about \"exactly as it happned,\" and then argue a scenario that would have ended the war without the bombs being dropped.  \n\nSo, anything that includes \"as it happened\" along with omitting the two bombs as causal factors, it wrong on its face.\n\nAs for a blockade, that was studied and deemed impossible.  In any event, had there been an blockade (an option you prefer to the bombs) there would have been millions more deaths - and very slow and agonizing at that. \n\nSo, congratulations!

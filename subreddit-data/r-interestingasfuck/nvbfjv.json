It will be cold water and only so you can wash your hands after using the toilet, not for you to brush your teeth or wash your face.  If you use a gel liquid hand soap it won't get all scummy inside the cistern after you wash your hands.  \n\n\nThis is only for handwashing after using the toilet.  Nothing more.",

Just look for example, at the languages spoken in former Yugoslavia. Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro and Bosnia all state that Serbian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Bosnian are individual languages despite being incredibly closely related and more intelligible with one another than many languages in China are with one another. Obviously, China does the opposite and groups them all as dialects for the sake of political unity.\n\nI prefer to think of the individual language groups in China (Mandarin, Yue, Wu, etc) like the Romance languages in Europe: paying extra attention, you can hear many of the same words in your own language and get the general gist of what's being said, but like you said, vocabulary might be different.",

Space is a premium here, but it's not such a premium that the toilet sink is the *only* sink. In over two decades living here in Japan, I've never seen that, and I can't even really imagine it. Edit: If you check out the responses to this comment, apparently it *does* happen, but it's \"you can live here for over 20 years and never see it\" levels of rare.\n  \nIf you're in a cramped apartment where space is *really* at a premium, you'll have a \"unit bath,\" which is like a small Western-style bathroom, by which I mean that the bath, sink, and toilet are all in the same room. In a unit bath, you might have a [main sink and a toilet *without* a toilet sink](https://i.imgur.com/zVJ1e8l.jpg), or you might have a [main sink and a toilet *with* a toilet sink](https://i.imgur.com/dz1Isxl.jpg). (I know this seems silly, but I suspect it's just a matter of sometimes toilets with sinks being cheaper, or having extra stock, or the like).  \n  \nIf your apartment is any bigger (and I'm still talking small by Western standards, just not super small) the toilet will be in its own room, separate from the room with the sink. That's the purpose for which the toilets being discussed here were developed. So you'll have the [toilet room](https://i.imgur.com/refIVl0.jpg) and then, elsewhere, the room with the [main sink](https://i.imgur.com/xRQV3sz.jpg).  \n  \nThere's almost never a situation where the toilet sink is the *only* sink.",

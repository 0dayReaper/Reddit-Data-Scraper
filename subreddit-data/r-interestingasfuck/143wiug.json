We have one window ac with leaky closure and regular filter. My friend is very kind to host me for the next few days . But this is only the beginning. We all know that right? It will clear and we will go back to regular habits without any change. I bought acres in Maine but even as I did I figured when it gets bad with drought those woods will burn. It is here, it is everywhere, no just on the near coast or the pacific coast. It is everywhere, I speak of climate change damage. I hoped it would wake people but that stupid morning joe coanchor Meeka was laughing as she spoke of the airport closing and saw pictures of NY ers wearing masks and going about their day. We are fiddling as the planet ignites and floods.",

The issue with California fires is that they've always happened and now humans want them to not happen. So dry debris piles up and you don't get the NECESSARY burns to get rid of it because far too many people have built their homes where they don't belong. Furthermore, there aren't adequate regulations to have NO brush within 30 feet of your home which experts agree is enough to prevent houses from catching fire during wild fires.\n\nBasically, California needs to let burns happen constantly and without stopping them but they can't because they didn't regulate this properly from the start. Hubris of man and all that.\n\nBut yeah, rakes weren't the answer.",

Both heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory of the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep\u2026.The elderly inform me the earth used to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now.\u201d\n\nHis belief was that deforrestation was the culprit. \n\nShit it\u2019s not something new people are sticking our heads in the ground about.\n\nedit: added quote.",

It\u2019s a really interesting way to maximise customisation and keep it really compact.\n\nI once visited an old style soda shop in the 90s that had these massive vats to store the different syrup flavours individually. You got a special glass with a bulb (not unlike an absinthe one) that held the right about of syrup before you poured in the soda and stirred thoroughly.\n\nThis machine is smaller than a vending machine and has more options that that entire shop.",

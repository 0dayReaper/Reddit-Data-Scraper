But half of the offspring are male, and not really useful for anything other than veal. Dairy cows are not the same as meat cows. So basically, drinking milk supports the veal industry.\n\nIt's not like honey production has the side effect of killing bees, so I don't think they are equivalent.",

You'd think it's a nonissue.\n\nThere's an incredible amount of negligence snd cruelty surrounding honey, even if not especially for the home keeper whom is often considered a moral good,\n\n...largely because the state of the industry exploits good intentions.\n\n\nCommon contentions against honey consumption even from backyard beekeepers are:\n\nAs a strong opener, the US Geological survey holds that any kind of honeybee keeping is in complete and utter antithesis to ANY scale of conservation, whatsoever. Honeybees cannot be cultivate on conservational property. They live in opposites to each other. Remember that as you read on.\n\nThe way Queens are handled in husbandry. At standard in the US, Queens have her wings nipped off, which we now know causes the equivalent to a constant, unending migraine for her. That aside, Queens often arrive dead, and can take several shipments to get a live one, which can still see her death if the hive rejects her. \n\nThere's concerns over amateur beekeepers spoiling the gene pool and breeding violent honeybees.\n\nHoneybees are a domesticated species. They can, and do, turn feral. They can, and will absolutely fucking KILL YOU. You! They will kill YOU, if you stumble upon one. Bee mismanagement and feral colonies are spreading disease, becoming aggressive, killing hives, killing indigenous insects, and taking over territories when we're already at devastating lows.\n\nFinally, there are huge, huge concerns by entomologists -- yk, the bug people with doctorates n' stuff -- that honeybees are both invasive and backed by too much agricultural money. We are very effectively saving the wrong bees on the entire US continent. \n\nHoneybees are not indigenous to the Americas, which are largely polinated by solitary wild bees, on whom the ecosystem is completely dependent on. Honeybees are territorial, and not only out-compete them, but proliferate disease at rates so violent it's difficult to upkeep measurements to read accurate data.\n\nAs that trophic level disappears faster than we can catalogue, agricultural businesses co-opt with honey megacorps to keep crops polinated instead of assisting conservation efforts, adding to the snowball.\n\nBackyard beekeeping is a huge wildcard in the complete and utter destruction of lower trophic levels of the American wilderness. Entomologists focused into conservation are NOT hyped about beekeeping. They ARE a legitimate problem, and cannot effectively reach Dave down the street harvesting small businesses honey, to tell him to plant indigenous, don't kill snakes, and stop mowing his lawn, instead.\n\nSo yeah. Honey bees are \ud83d\udc4e in the States. Best that we just don't pay these people.",

So far same story for figs and apples.\n\n\nThe only difference is, that the fig plant digests wasp eggs. So where does the animal get harmed. Wasps and figs are only in a symbiosis relationship. The fig is just more direct with its food source. Probably developed, because the fig originates from a low ressource ground, while other fruit plants have/require better conditions for soil. \n\nI don't see the reasoning here. Does the fig fruit still build without the wasp eggs? I guess the fruit should only require polination and not the eggs necessarely. I would say, that the digestion of the wasp eggs are more of a defence mechanism, so the hatching wasps don't feed on the fruit, which the plant needs for reproduktion. Luckily it tourned out beneficiary for the fig plant to digest and absorb the eggs instead of whatever nature feels like. \n\nObviously i go now far beyond reasoning now, but applying the logic of veganism, that no animal should be harmed, what about self defence mechanisms of trees against other insects. Depending on the health of the plant they are vulnerable against different types of insects, so some plants mix different poisenings into their resin so the feeder will die or let of the plant.\n\nI am no biologist, but would this disqualify any plant doing this, because it harms animals just like the fig did. The plant just defended itself while harming insects. \nI don't believe that the wasp gives the fig the eggs freely for digestion after polination and nektar. The wasp lays her eggs there, because its a feeding ground for its offsprings, thus harming the plant.",

One of the comments suggested that it's not really vegan because of the wasps. Got a bit of ridicule from other commentators. I assume they were vegan too, so I guess opinions vary.\n\nIt was a tasty pudding but not the same as one made with eggs.",

There are no dead wasps in figs. Just seeds - nothing more. \n\nWhat does happen to that wingless wasp, we hear you ask? Thanks to an enzyme (known as ficin) that\u2019s present in figs, the dead wasps are simply broken down and absorbed back into the fruit. \n\nRemember, not all figs have wasps in them. Some varieties - including many grown for the supermarkets - don\u2019t need to be pollinated by fig wasps. Instead, they\u2019re sprayed with certain hormones to make the fruit ripen or they\u2019re simply a type of fig that doesn\u2019t need pollination.\"\n\n\nThe reason the wasp is wingless for those that don't want to click the link is that the hole the wasp uses to get to the centre of the fig is so small that its wings won't fit too. \n\n\nhttps://www.oddbox.co.uk/blog/are-there-dead-wasps-in-figs-how-figs-are-grown#:~:text=Before%20you%20go%20thinking%20that,Just%20seeds%20%2D%20nothing%20more.",

We only take what honey they don\u2019t need in an ethical manner (they usually produce much more than is needed by the colony) The bees needs come first so if there isn\u2019t enough honey we take none. Sometime they don\u2019t produce enough honey to make it through dearths so we actually feed them nectar or pollen for survival. In the wild those would likely die. Also without the BeeK many wild colonies will collapse due to an invasive mite they have no resistance to. I would say at this point humans and bees almost have a symbiotic relationship. Bee keeping has been going on for at least 10,000 years. We have a long history working together.",

There, they grift by spending &lt; $1/day feeding inmates, ignoring the need for medical treatment, forcing them to do hard labor all day every day.\n\nHere it's sexual crimes; trying to make women grovel for the littlest favor, or perhaps the littlest reduction in humiliating treatment, while the guys in the fancy uniforms chuckle and guffaw among themselves, knowing that they know exactly where every camera's placed.",

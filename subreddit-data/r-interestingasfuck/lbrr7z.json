I think the ideal spot is a pace or two left (any maybe one or two back), maybe just in front of the door.  That's based on the \"cut\" edges visible.  We see too much of it to see none of the right side of the door frame at this distance, and a closer perspective should give the right most letters a more angled perspective.  However, that may mess with the windows unless you also lower the camera a bit, and even then the size might be noticably off.  At least that's the best I could say without measurements.\n\nSo, I think the fact that this piece looks good out if place here means it would look good within a modest area.  However, if your perspective crosses the edge of letter v, it would be immediately apparent that it's painted on.  However, I think the style would still look fine.  It just wouldn't be illusory.\n\nUnrelated note, I'm not sure it's the intent or not, but I love the idea of this piece calling out these places being run down and empty in a society where homelessness exists.  The word vile and drawing attention to this place being empty seem to suggest that's the intent, but I lack context to say for sure.",

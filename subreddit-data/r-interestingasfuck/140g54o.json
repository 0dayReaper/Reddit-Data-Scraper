The accidental spread of disease was bad enough--but we had to follow it with deliberate massacres. And by some accounts, deliberate spread of disease too. If only we'd done it right, we might have become a patchwork of Native and immigrant, perhaps in a confederation, perhaps as friendly allies. So many tribes and nations could have survived, and once we got vaccination underway the disease problem would have been solved too. \n\nIf only...",

I'm pretty sure that a bunch of raiders could have, too. They never will now, because they got massacred. But they could have.

This has been true basically throughout recorded history. These nomadic steppe warriors remained a threat to their neighbors until technological progress (mainly, mass utilization of gunpowder weapons) allowed them to be defeated. Very few voluntarily changed their lifestyle to live in harmony with their settled neighbors until after they were crushed - it was only victorious steppe armies (e.g the mongols)  who were prone to assimilate into the culture of the people they ruled over.  \n\nSo no, I don't think it's the same thing as being a member of hitler youth. Steppe nomadic life is so fundamentally different from settled life in terms of basic assumptions that it's not surprising that there are basically zero examples of unconquered steppe nomads living in peace with their neighbors.",

The land belongs to them and many are working to figure out how to interpret that in a modern context. The islands were seized from them through colonization first by the Spanish and then extended by the Americans. \n\nAnother example, Yosemite was stolen from Sierra Miwoks in 1850 during the Mariposa war which was by most interpretations a genocide.\n\nSo genocide really is the true legacy of national parks in the USA. Indigenous people should be allowed to determine the future of it. If they want to maintain national parks and forests as tourist attractions then the proceeds should go to their tribes. If they want to alter the land in other ways, they should be allowed to do so. Land is a measure of generational wealth and indigenous people suffered incalculable losses and are still the most impoverished group in the nation.",

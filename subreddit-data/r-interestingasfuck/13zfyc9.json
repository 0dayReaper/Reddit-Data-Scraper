It's usually only used for nerd shit or e readers and the frame rate has always been pretty shit and color can be hard sometimes... but its getting better! Honestly just seeing it using these vibrant colors in a marketable way is cool. Even if it's not a detailed enough demonstration to see how the quality is up close and is still probably pretty grainy.",

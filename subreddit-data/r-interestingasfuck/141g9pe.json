You need very specific conditions to climb. No one can predict what the weather is going to do. In a season where the weather is good the current number of permits may be just fine but if the weather doesn't do what you want it to you end up with way too many people squeezing into the brief weather windows, potentially making things more dangerous for everyone. I guess I don't see how they fix that short of selling permits and then not allowing everyone that has a permit to climb if the weather doesn't cooperate.",

You have to have summitted another peak at least 21k feet (or something like that, I don't know the exact requirement), you have to be an experienced mountaineer, etc. etc.\n\nAll that doesn't stop people from dying. Everyone on that peak is a good climber. Everest is Everest and the best mountaineer in the world could die on it on a good day.",

Everest.\n\nThe short version of the story is my Uncle attended an expedition to the top in the late 70s. He had been in that part of the world in his strange journey of adventure, self discovery, and eventual transition to Buddhism. As he tells it, everything went pretty smoothly until they were close to the summit. At least, as far as long distance back breaking hiking in the cold goes. There, about an hour from the summit the weather showed signs of turning bad and there was some sort of discussion about it. The Sherpa said if they were quick, they might miss it but there was a 50/50 chance they were going to get hit by the storm to some extent. They made the decision to hit the summit before turning back.\n\nThey made it to the summit without much issue as my uncle tells it, but on their way back down they had to take shelter best as they could. It sounded like they just found a flat rockface opposite of the wind and pressed up against a near vertical surface as best they could until the wind died down. My uncle said he thought they were stuck there for about 6 hours before they could make their way down and it was dark and treacherous. On the way down they saw a person from their expedition that tried to take their chances climbing down instead of taking shelter from the wind. He had somehow busted up his ankle and was too exhausted to move around very much in his severely frostbitten state. He pled to the other climbers for help, but the Sherpa called everyone over to where the man couldn't hear them and told everyone that man was dead, and everyone that tried to help him would likely also die. Everyone agreed they were too exhausted and as they were walking by this man pleading for help my uncle took some pictures.\n\nMy uncle is a bit of an exaggerator, so there is some amount of disbelief to the story when he tells it, but we've seen the pictures he took while he was there. He has the negatives too and according to my Uncle the man's name was John.\n\nMaybe someone that knows more about climbing Everest can debunk my Uncle's story, but when my Uncle tells it, it's about an hour long so I'm leaving a ton of things out since I haven't heard the story in a good 25 years.",

There\u2019s some argument if a summit actually counts if you don\u2019t make it back down. \n\nCould have been Ray Genet if the expedition was American. If it was a bit earlier in the 70s then it could have been British. Sounds like a similar story to how Genet and German climber Hannelore died. There\u2019s no mention of any busted ankle but they did stay overnight in the SE ridge and died of exposure.",

I love it. It sustains me. I have zero desire to hike everest, zero. It's not even what I think of as mountain climbing/hiking. Waiting in line to summit?  No thanks. Needing/carrying oxygen tanks? Nope. Having someone else carry my stuff and show me the way?, that's bs. Walking by dead bodies and not being able to help them? Inhumane. Paying big bucks to climb?ridiculous.  Leaving my trash on the mountain? Crazy entittled selfishness. Cant bring my dogs? They would not stand for it!   I could go on.  I don't get it? It must be ego? Folks who like to face death? I don't know but I definately don't want it on my life.",

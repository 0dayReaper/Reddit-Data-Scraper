So if they see you with a bag of potato chips in your hand, or a half eaten sandwich, they will intentionally try and scare you to drop the sandwich and run off so they can eat it, or they will follow you til they can steal it from your hand. They will even climb into your vehicle and search for food too.",

In fact, it has been observed that \"lions usually ambush their prey by hiding in long grass, often in close proximity to a watering hole\".",

She'd live in the backyard for the most part, but would occasionally walk further. Whenever she wanted food or pets she climbed up a tree and jumped to the window sill, tapping the glass to be let back in.\n\nWhenever we travelled to my relatives we took her with us and there she'd actually accompany me on walks, just crashing through the brush beside me in the woods or jumping through the snow.\n\nShe was also never really distant or afraid, I'd often wake up with her sleeping on my chest or back in the summer, since she just hopped back in through the window.

One squirrel had come out into the path and was being very cute and begging for them to feed him. When they reached out with a nut, he would move back a little, towards some bushes. They stepped forward towards him each time. \n\nWhen they were close enough, two previously hidden squirrels jumped from the bushes, landed on the woman and stole the whole bag from her. All three then ran off with the nuts.\n\nFull-on planned squirrel mugging!",

And I thought it was strange for the animal to be there and not run up a tree when I came near so I kind of slowed down to see what it would do, but it wouldn\u2019t run away. It kinda came towards me. Then it climbed up on my body and hid under my armpit and it stayed there, so not knowing what to do. I just went home and the squirrel clung to me under my arm without being scared of me or my roommates or anyone. So I showed it to friends. I showed it to my neighbours because I didn\u2019t know what to do. I thought, maybe I adopted  a squirrel or something. I even called my mum to see if she knew anything about squirrels and advice on how to look after them as I thought it was going to stay with me.  After a couple of hours it\u2019s came down my body and it wanted to leave the house by that time the rain had slowed and almost disappeared and I realised that the animal was just really cold and wet and it needed a place to warm up and my armpit was the closest warmest place, but it was a nice experience having a squirrel for a pet for a couple of hours",

Every letter I write seems to squeeze another drop of hydration from my shriveling, lizard-like body. Next time you're walking through a park and stumble on a squirrel and a hungover man, think twice about giving that sweet liquid life to an acorn stuffing son of a bitch. Give it to someone who makes poor choices and can't get out of bed to grab water.",

Military guy. He screamed so loud at that cat it went into freeze mode. That squirel stayed on his shoulder for 20 mins, and he walked around carrying that squirel on his shoulder and even fed it peanut butter from his finger. That cat never came back. And that squirel had a family. \n\nWe are really beautiful when we care. And deadly scary when we care a lot.",

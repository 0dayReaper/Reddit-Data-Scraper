It's a reminder that we should apparently be grateful for the opportunity to be a wage slave so that we can have our meager shelter instead of being punted to the streets. So long as it keeps us motivated to continue to provide value to their companies, they're happy to keep unhoused people at least a little bit visible.

Actual sociological research into the problems indicates that housing availability/affordability accounts for temporary homelessness, but only about 5-10% of all homelessness (people who cannot afford housing in downtown areas almost always displace to more affordable areas). Granted this makes that the most accessible aspect of the problem to attempt. Research also demonstrates that things like tiny home projects are really just feel good projects for those involved in building them and do not actually have meaningful effect, either failing to operate at anywhere near capacity, or completely closing down within 6-12months. In addition there\u2019s long-standing proof that shelters are even more dangerous than the streets themselves with extremely high rates of theft, robberies, assaults, and rapes. As seen in Seattle, the chronically homeless build their own camps. They *have* homes, it\u2019s just not a house or an apartment. And they\u2019re dangerous af. \n\nMan it\u2019s almost like letting a bunch of people with diagnosed and untreated or undiagnosed mental illnesses run around town while flinging money around to purchase old run down hotels isn\u2019t a good idea.",

Rent here is probably more than an entire minimum-wage income at this point.\n\nThe hotel does actually help people avoid becoming homeless; because it has functional showers and can function as an address, it helps people who become temporarily homeless not lose their jobs or get jobs.\n\nI think you're just going to have to house some people to fix homelessness. There are people who can't be fixed and there are people who won't let you try to fix them.",

My clients have access to therapy multiple times per week, different types of therapies, mental hospital stays, psychiatry, you name it. Lots of my clients have improved significantly. Many don't have any substance use or behavioral issues, mostly poverty. Most of my clients are disabled and on SSI, which is about $900 monthly. Others work but can't work too much or will lose services. Even those with perfect rental history, no negative factors, etc can't find housing because landlords have too strict requirements and housing costs too much. I have clients I've been working with for 2 years who still haven't gotten housing because there's nothing affordable.\n\nSo it really comes down to raising income/SSI payments and lowering housing costs and requirements.",

When every aspect of your life is shit drugs can give you a break. When drugs are the only tiny bit of good in your life you become addicted. If these people are given good things in their life, like a decent place to live, they can start to recover from their addiction. Trying to make a homeless person quit drugs first is literally taking away the only bearable part of their existence. Why would anyone choose that, especially after all the trauma you've gone through by the time you're at that point?",

Sure, if you give 100% of people who are homeless a place to stay, some of them will get their lives together. However, a vast majority of them do not have the drive, wherewithal, or understanding of how to become a productive member of society. You would be wasting your money on a huge percentage of them by just giving the keys to a residence. I\u2019m speaking from experience as someone who has lived with these people I\u2019ve battled with addiction, jail time, and borderline homelessness myself. \n\nMany people become homeless because they exhaust every single resource they have and screw over every single person they know until they have literally nothing left. Many times because of drugs. Having a place to stay will not alter that mindset. It has to come from within. \n\nAs a recovered addict myself, I\u2019ve tried more than once to give addict friends a chance by giving them a place to stay. They steal and lie until I can\u2019t have them around anymore. It\u2019s absolutely exhausting. I just don\u2019t see how there can be a positive ROI without addressing the root cause at the same time.",

You\u2019re right about that, but you\u2019re completely ignoring everything else I and others here are trying to say. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that giving a homeless person (even one who is seriously drug addicted or mentally ill) a home and a weekly check in with a social worker COSTS SOCIETY LESS than having them live on the street.  [this article](https://www.turnto23.com/news/homeless/breaking-down-the-cost-of-homelessness) reports an average cost (to society, the taxpayer) of $40,000 a year to have someone on the street and a savings of $28000 a year just by giving them long term housing. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that housing first will somehow enable all of the chronic homeless to become productive citizens again, just that it\u2019s better in almost every way than what we have now.  \n\nWe should go a step further and implement universal basic housing - a housing credit enough to pay for a clean, safe, if tiny apartment or that could be applied towards a larger/nicer home.  Because giving free housing to the homeless, while the right thing to do both ethically and economically, isn\u2019t fair to those working and struggling to be able to afford housing. \n\nBut that will probably never happen in our lifetimes because capitalism requires the threat of homelessness in order to function.  That\u2019s a different topic though.",

It was a big organization, and I traveled all over southern California servicing different shelters, and met quite a few executives. \n\nI seriously doubt one hundredth of that money actually goes toward the homeless. I didn't get a great look at how money was allocated, but I did service all of the buildings they bought and sold, and they traded properties like they were pokemon cards.  They'd spend money on the facets of the building to draw in investors, then cut every corner with equipment and facilities. \n\nI ended up leaving after watching a man give up a community garden. He was a case manager who had a troubled past and turned his life around. At one point, he started a community garden and got some of the clients involved. It helped them deal with addictions and let them produce something for the community, feel a sense of purpose. Well, the board member who owned that building decided they wanted to sell it. The thing that pissed me off is they wanted to avoid retaliation from clients and staff, so they didn't tell anyone they were selling the property until the week of. I knew the site was being torn down the previous week, no one else knew until an hour before I showed up. \n\nWe can keep throwing money at the issue, but nothing will change if we don't address core issues.  For instance, this organization probably owned enough buildings to drive up property prices, and the board members were using these houses as investments or tax write offs. They aren't going to sell to a family",

Where to get free food and a shower. \nThey introduced me to people who lived that lifestyle of trying to find drugs and alcohol just to spend the night fucked up in the park.

They may have their own laws and have their own standards for what is questionable....we'll never really know for sure.  Maybe they have a law to not swim within 5 feet of a squid and if they do they get sent to dolphin jail?  Or have a law to only play with a pufferfish for 10 minutes or they get a dolphin fine. :)",

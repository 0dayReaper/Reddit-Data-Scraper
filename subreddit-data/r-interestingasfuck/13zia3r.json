In the brief window of time after the Ottoman Empire receded we kind of all started killing each other for any number of dumb reasons, but that didn't last too long because  when Communism came all religions were suppressed equally. Then when it fell we started killing each other again like when the empire fell for some more dumb reasons. Then we chilled out again, now in the post-communist environment religiosity is fairly low among all groups although we still identify with the religion as a kind of group identity rather than any of us being particularly devout. We argue over the things our groups did to each other rather than argue about theology. Personally I think everyone in this region is an atheist who is just pretending because it is too baked into the culture to stop doing.\n\nI can assure you though that they played an overall negative role in the history of the region as the reason you converted was because it gave you an administrative role within the Ottoman Empire which put you above the others around you and thus were acting in the role of oppressor which sometimes manifested in things that were up to and including slavery and genocide, although that was more the Ottomans specifically than something any group should have to bear the blame for. The empire is not one people like. The european muslims we admire are generally people like Ataturk who did stuff like abolish the caliphate, as in he was technically a muslim but he did stuff to reduce the influence of islam and the empire.",

In our teachings we believe jews are people of the book and are even permitted to marry them. All the vitriol targeting jews that comes from arab nations was stirred up by foreign intervention, propaganda and proxy battles or it\u2019s directed at Israel the government not the religion of Judaism. Do they sometimes get conflated in speech, yes. But every stand problem with Jews isn\u2019t Judaism or ethnicity, it\u2019s Israel especially in modern day",

I'm always surprised by Reddit.\n\nMuslims hating Jews is literally not a thing.\n\nFirst, Muslims don't hate the religion of Judaism.\n\nSecond, Muslims and Jews as Arabs lived together for many generations and even under the Ottomans in peace and happiness.\n\nThird, when I mention my first point, some smart people try to differentiate between Jew and Jew, one a person who is a Jew and another being sort of a race. If we do this differentiation, then Muslims should never be in the discussion. Palestinians hate the people who committed genocide to their people. Lebanese hate the people who attempted to occupy their lands(in which they were deterred). That's more accurate.\n\nLastly, I have no idea how this post came to be, it truly does bother me and for that, I'm embarrassed, because I know nothing on Reddit should be taken seriously.",

He argued that \"world Jewry\" aimed to infiltrate and subjugate Palestine, a sacred religious and cultural center of the Arab and Muslim world, as a staging ground for the seizure of all Arab lands. In his vision of the world, the Jews intended to enslave and exploit Arabs, to seize their land, to expropriate their wealth, undermine their Muslim faith and corrupt the moral fabric of their society. He labeled the Jews as the enemy of Islam, and used crude racist terminology to depict Jews and Jewish behavior, particularly as he forged a closer relationship with the\u00a0SS\u00a0in 1943 and 1944. He described Jews as having immutable characteristics and behaviors. On occasion, he would compare Jewishness to infectious disease and Jews to microbes or bacilli. In at least one speech attributed to him, he advocated killing Jews wherever Arabs found them. He consistently advocated \"removing\" the Jewish homeland from Palestine and, on occasion, driving every Jew out of Palestine and other Arab lands.\"\nhttps://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/hajj-amin-al-husayni-wartime-propagandist\nhttps://www.meforum.org/5318/hajj-amin-antisemitism\nhttps://www.hoover.org/research/mufti-and-holocaust\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/sfi.usc.edu/news/2015/10/10250-did-haj-amin-al-husseini-influence-hitler%3famp",

The academic debate today is about whether the Mufti inspired the Final Solution.  In other words, the debate is over whether he inspired Hitler or whether Hitler inspired him.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean that the Mufti wasn't also a fervent and sincere anti-Zionist.  There's no contradiction between the two, much as current anti-Israel bigots would like us to believe (\"We love Jews: it's only Jews that are emancipated and can defend themselves that we don't like.  We LOVE subservient Jews\").  Jews escaped Hitler and his Arab allies to find refuge in Israel.  The Muftis goal was to eliminate them there.  AntiZionism and AntiSemitism are kissing cousins.",

These are the people who did the Armenian genocide amongst a few others that aren't that well known. Even though the Young Turks were secular in their belief, that made Hitler very interested in the Muslim world and gradually Islam as well. \n\nThere is also the fact that many Muslims sided with him because they were trying to get rid of colonisation.\n\nThe Nazi party, their beliefs and their culture and quite complex and interesting, and are unfortunately mispotrayed in modern media to make them worse than what they were, which never sat right with me, because then it's easy for Nazis to point and say \"see, all propaganda\". \n\nI always believed that they should be portrayed as they were. Both their better sides, like a lot of their high command believing in knights code and their worse sides like real life Amon G\u00f6th being a much bigger monster.",

Most of them were pro germany, not necessarly pro Nazis. It was mostly a \"the enemy of my enemy\" kind of strategy. We can argue that nothing can be worse than being under the nazi rule. However to most people from those countries, the nazi rule would have been a blessing compared to the allies. You can check the masacres, the ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity commited by the allies prior to, during and after WWII.\n\nA small exemple : [France beheaded the algerian freedom fighters and sent their heads to the museum of humanity to be kept in cardboard boxes.](https://www.france24.com/en/20200703-france-returns-skulls-of-algerians-who-fought-colonisation)  It was done to deny them degnity in death and not make them into heros. To add to that, France is responsable for the killing of over 1.5 M algerian post WWII, to keep its rule over Algeria. The Nazis were monsters, but they were not the only ones.",

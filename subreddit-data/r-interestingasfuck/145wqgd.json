Mostly they are shaped like squares. \nBut they are in nearly every cities. \n\nImagine that you live in a flat and don't have access to a garden. Then you can buy a colony garden! There you have a small house, mostly one or two rooms with a tiny kitchen. In many cases there is electricity and maybe running water outside, but there is no restroom facilities in your house. The restrooms are shared with the neighbors.  \n\nYou can stay and sleep over in your colony garden, but only in a specific amount of time each year. In your colony garden you can grow vegetables, flowers or just have a garden to play in with your kids. \n\nI love the idea of a colony garden, but most of the time they are actually quite expensive to buy. Once you bought it, it doesn't cost a lot. \n\n\nPs. Sorry for my english if there is any mistakes \ud83d\ude09",

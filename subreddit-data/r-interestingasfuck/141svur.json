It technically just means \u201cman\u201d. At any rate, I agree, it\u2019s somewhat of a dumb way of wording it, but it\u2019s also just colloquial. No one is denying that other species of Homo are *forms* of human. Now with that all being said, naledi really does (morphologically) blur the line between human and australopithecine, and it\u2019s not entirely sure when we diverged (their divergence could have occurred as early as 2.0-1.9 mya, when H. habilis and early H. erectus was just beginning to appear on the fossil record). They had very small brains within the range of chimpanzees, ape-like faces with a great degree of prognathism and flat, inverted noses, and retained anatomical adaptations for an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. Their primitive physical characteristics is what makes these findings so fascinating. That coupled with the age of their remains (only 330,000-230,000 years old, roughly a whopping 1.4 million years after the last appearance of Australopithecus on the fossil record) is what made the species so novel and sensational in the first place when it was discovered back in 2015.",

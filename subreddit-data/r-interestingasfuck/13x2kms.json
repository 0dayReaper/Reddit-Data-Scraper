Although the laws of Ecuador prohibited it because this is a protected species and the deforestation of the Amazonas has already done enough damage to their natural habitat, smuggling these little dudes out of the country was very profitable, and the market for exotic pets was huge. Many of them were therefore smuggled illegally in horrible conditions and a great deal of them died. Once with the new owners, many also failed to adapt to the new climate/diet and died as well. Please don't try to get one of these as pets.",

And sometimes you can add new bits, but only if your new bit was ground down using orphans, like the original (or whatever methods were used).  Collectors are weird.\n\nIf you do decide to touch it, probably the best plan is to make any modifications 100% reversible, if possible, so you can 'unrestore' it to it's original state in case you ever need to sell.",

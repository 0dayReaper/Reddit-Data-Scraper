Perhaps they're just voicing their disagreement as to what you said.\n\nAs a resident of Singapore myself however, I think it's better to clear up this common misconception about the country. Laws in Singapore arent actually that far off from other countries in terms of punishment.  Drug laws here in Singapore are quite strictly enforced, you're right, but they are mainly aimed to curb the actual dealing of drugs rather than the abusers themselves. Like another commenter has mentioned,  being caught with a joint on you will get you deported if you aren't a resident, as they want to minimise drug trafficking of any sort. The fact remains, if you're an average person living in Singapore or coming in for tourism, it's extremely unlikely you'll get into trouble with authorities.\n\nAlso when it comes to drugs, I know at least one person here who has been caught with controlled drugs by the authorities, and they are very much alive right now. It's not a police state as a lot of media portrays it to be haha",

Not to mention bikes are alot more nimble and u get better sense of ur surroundings allowing them to drive closer together. Other benefits  unrelated to traffic is ofc they are 0 emission, being quieter and in my opinion make a city alot more lively than having bunch of metal boxes filling the road honking at each other.",

Production and reparations do not come for free. Also transport cost, that your Chinese or Japanese bike parts arrive where you live. \n\nThat\u2019s no bike bashing of course. The more options, the better. And bikes are a great addition for each city next to cars, busses, trains and motorcycles. \n\nTo everyone what suits you best.",

Emmisions from bikes compared to cars are so low, might as well call it 0.\n\nHow did you get to those numbers? Is it a like to like comparison?\n\nNot saying you're wrong, but it seems highly unlikely to me. Steel wheels on steel tracks are so much more efficient than rubber wheels, and the aerodynamic profile of (modern) trains is much better than cars due to the long length. Maybe this is true if you compare a hypothetical full car to the current occupancy of trains.\n\nAnd even then, your argument that you have to put a person on the roof or in the trunk to beat trains is sheer ridicule.",

It's clearly asking if the reason the lane isn't backed up is because it's more efficient or because it's less used.\n\nAlso: neither. Either whatever's backing up the traffic lane isn't impeding the bikes (which is likely, especially since even if the bike lane is blocked, the bikes could likely leave the lane to go around, whereas cars can't really do that so well), or the bike lane simply hasn't gotten backed up as far yet.",

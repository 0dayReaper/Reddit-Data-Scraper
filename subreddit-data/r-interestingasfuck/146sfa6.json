Its fucked up that History repeats itself to the point a Nation is falling apart because of greed and insanity of another nation. That it had to come to this point we are delivering weapons after weapons because we need to help a peaceful Nation that wanted to look to a brighter future.  What russia is doing rn is what Nazi Germany did 1941. The USSR was as bad. Stalin knew eventually Hitler would attack and knew his plans about conquering the east. Stalin just wast ready for war in 1939 and wanted to use all the time he could get to get ready for fighting Nazi Germany to basically do the same they tried.\nEdit: What i wanted to say is, yes, the USSR are considered the \"good Guys\" because they fought the Nazis. But even then the West die Not really liked them. They were mostly seen as a tool by the West and dropped after WW2. And Stalin wasnt really backstabbed. Both knew war was inevitable.",

Also irrigation and water diversion to other areas like local farmland/ the Crimea peninsula will be disrupted.",

Does that mean that people before that weren't allowed to love this country ? \n\nLoving your country, despite the defaults it has at the point of history you live in, is what gives you the will to improve it, make it change. \n\nLet's say you're American, living under Trump's administration. Aren't you allowed to love your country ? And if still loving it, aren't you able to recognize how bad Trump's administration is, how desatruous for women's and minorities rights it is ? \n\nI'm flabbergasted by these reactions.

No. I live right next to russia and therefore have a lot of interactions with russians. A lot of them do not wish for this to happen, but of course given the government and how it functions they have no choice. They either enter the war or get forcefully dragged into it by secret police.\n\nWhich is also how it happens in Ukraine, to my knowing. IIRC there are videos of Ukrainian recruitment officers taking men off the streets to force them into the war effort in Ukraine. Not unlike how Russia operates. The men already in Ukraine have no choice whether to participate or not. A lot of those videos you saw at the start of the war of men saying goodbye to their families were not voluntary. I do not find that to be comforting, as many people somehow did. But this is a practice that all countries in eastern europe have, unfortunately.\n\nNot to mention the amount of corruption that was and still is going on in Ukraine, that drastically affected the Ukrainian people. To me, there are no good guys in this fight. It is nothing but a proxy between Russia and the west, with the working classes at the bottom having to suffer the losses of this pointless conflict.",

They did this because Russia was expecting to lose control of the territory anyway due to Ukraine's offensive. By flooding the area they can delay any push through that area allowing them to reallocate their forces to a shorter front line. It also causes a humanitarian disaster for the local civilian population which would tend to burden the Ukrainian forces, diverting effort that could otherwise be dedicated to pushing back Russia.\n\nRussia doesn't care about the well being of the civilians in the area being flooded, even when most of them were controlled by Russia, because they don't view the Ukrainian population as important and may eventually have wanted to genocide them anyway.",

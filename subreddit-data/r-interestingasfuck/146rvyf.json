That hill is actually where they conducted tests with gliders a few years before. For testing the airplane/\"flying machine\", they started from the ground where the plaque in the first picture is and put the plane basically on a sled/track, powered it up and went off.\n\nAlso fun fact, the plane was destroyed by wind on that very same day after their last test. But it was patched up and now sits in the National Air and Space Museum\n\nAlso ALSO fun fact: Wilbur Wright once said \u201cno airship will ever fly from New York to Paris.\u201d",

Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights. Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.\n\n&gt;\tThe aviation historian C.H. Gibbs-Smith was a supporter of the Wrights' claim to primacy in flight. He wrote that a barn door can be made to \"fly\" for a short distance if enough energy is applied to it; he determined that the very limited flight experiments of Ader, Vuia, and others were \"powered hops\" instead of fully controlled flights.",

I don't think they *should* be doing that in a democratic society, but that's the world we live in and it's not a perfect world at this stage.\n\nBut this berserker charge seems to me like it's pretty much guaranteed to fail; they're gonna crash into the people, the people are packed too tightly to be able to really go anywhere, and then with all their velocity, they're gonna have isolated cops crashing into the big crowd, surrounded by uninjured people they just really pissed off. How's that gonna end?\n\nIt seems like the two possible outcomes are either that (i.e. big melee with isolated cops getting dragged around and injured), or else exactly what happened. I think these cops need remedial riot thug training in order to be effective if they're gonna be suppressing the masses.",

And of course when it came to the last election they voted Boris as they still believed the propaganda and Boris was the bloke to get it done. Don't give up on giving them a alternative point of view, combat the blatant bullshit, point out how 12 years ago the Tories made them suffer austerity which never ended and now they going to be told that they need to tighten their belts again, all while the richer have just got richer.\nTruss's mini budget told you all you need to know about the Tories, tax cuts for the highest earners, remove the cap on their banker friends bonuses and who was going to pay for it? You, me and every working person and not just this generation but your children too because those cuts were unfunded meaning the government would have had to borrow the money adding even more to the national debt that has done nothing but spiraled upwards under the Tories. Be part of the change dude, don't give up on people still believing the right wing bullshit, show them it's just that, bullshit.",

                                    "comment": "If your retirement system runs a deficit you only really have three ways to solve that: \n-\tmake people pay more for their retirement, which modern governments don\u2019t like because it means taxation. \n-\treducing pensions, which retirees won\u2019t like (and retirees vote a lot more than young people) \n-\treducing the number of retirees. Since you can\u2019t exactly kill old people to make room, the only real way to do that is to make it harder to become a retiree. Hence pushing back the age of retirement. \n\nNote however that in reality pushing back the age of retirement does not really change the age people will retire. In fact, most people at that age are sick or unemployed. According to the French State only 35.5% of people over 60 have a job (some are unemployed, some are retired, \u2026). And the life expectancy in good health (meaning the age at which you begin to have crippling health issues) is 65. So pushing back the retirement age likely won\u2019t make people retire later: it will make people retire poorer since they will leave with an incomplete career and lose part of their pensions. It\u2019s a sneaky way to reduce the pensions of retirees without saying you will reduce the pension of retirees. And since it only concerns the future retirees, current ones donne care. And current ones vote a lot more. \n\nThe thing is that according to the French government own experts (the COR, the retirement orientation council) this is not needed. The deficit of the retirement system is temporary and will solve on its own when boomer start to die en masse in the next decades. In the meantime a slight (and again, temporary) rise in taxation would be enough if we really wanted to make it break even, which we wouldn\u2019t even necessarily want to. Raising the retirement age could even have an adverse effect on unemployment, such that it could wipe out the financial benefits.",

It's by design. The same is true for the navigation systems and apps like Naver. The purpose is is to change behavior, not necessarily to give someone a ticket. If the systems everywhere tell you \"hey, slow down\", you're likely to slow down. Especially if you can.",

My small (~1500 people) town has an intersection of 2 relatively makor regional highways. The city limits of the town itself are about a mile radius in a rough circle. About 5 years ago, the city incorporated 2-3 miles of land following the roads out of town about 50 yards wide simply to be able to pull more folks over. The cities total income last year was $275k. $220k was from fines. Fucking bullshit",

If Americans wanted to protest on any scale in DC it could very easily reach France\u2019s levels. Fact is that the French simply have protesting in their blood, while Americans, as a culture, consider it much higher stakes.",

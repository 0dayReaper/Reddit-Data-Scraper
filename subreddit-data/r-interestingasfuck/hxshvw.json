If I just need to make one of these, it's easier to go straight from a technical drawing to manufacturing, and just tweak the parts to make it work as you go. If the mechanism requires a gear, it may be helpful to use CAD, but there are tools that will cut gears of different sizes anyway so it's not necessary if you have those already.\n\nThe mechanical engineering skillset will definitely help, but it's not necessary if you go through a bit of trial and error, or look up similar mechanisms to build a design from.\n\nsource; am a mechanical engineer &amp; hobbyist watch repairer",

And a silicone band will usually cost more than the watch itself.). I have showered hundreds of times with the watch strapped to my wrist, swam in a pool, and performed sweaty, physically demanding blue collar work with the F-91W on, and it just fucking works. The display light sucks though, so maybe my next watch will have an indiglo feature.  That's like a 7 dollar upgrade!",

They engrave and polish just about every piece, including the tiny screws that you barely can even see. Also they have features (features are called complications) such as a minute repeater which chimes out the hour, minute, and second all mechanically. Or they might have a perpetual calendar complication that is always correct or be able to switch to any of the dozens of time zones in the world. \n\nThe Zeitwerk is special in that it is a \"digital\" type display. All mechanically, the numbers flip over precisely. And the Master Ultrathin Tourbillon has the time keeping component in a constantly rotating cage (called a tourbillon) while being quite thin for having that component. \n\nSo basically, they're pretty much only worth it if $90k is a drop in the bucket for you and you're also into that kind of really fine and precise craftsmanship. But yeah, there's also better things to do with that money.",

If you buy a watch that costs $100k you're most likely living in a mansion and drive a luxury sports car. A Subaru Outback has 0 value to you.\n\nThese watches are pieces of art just like the coin in this post, they are showcases of insane levels of craftsmanship, artistry, and dedication to details. The person you replied to mentioned the Lange &amp; S\u00f6hne Zeitwerk. Just take a look at how the case back of that watch looks (the patterns are carved in by hand): [http://ablogtowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Lange-Sohne-Zeitwerk-Striking-pink-gold-3.jpg](http://ablogtowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-Lange-Sohne-Zeitwerk-Striking-pink-gold-3.jpg)\n\n([this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UuofEFjPKs) also provides a nice look at that particular watch)",

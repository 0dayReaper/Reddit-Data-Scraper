When I was younger I loved the ocean so she painted an elaborate ocean view all around my room. When I was older I liked science and especially space so she repainted it to be space themed with a huge apollo rocket and everything. Looking back, that was so essential for me as a kid. Especially where I am now in life where I think I may be on the spectrum. My room always made me feel safe and helped to inspire my creativity. I loved my grandmother so much for seeing me as who I was and helping me to be myself when no one else would. She even attended my metal bands first show when I got to high school and she couldn't stand that music lol. Anyway I just wanted to say your work will be more than appreciated, even more than they know now. I promise you they will look back on it with the same fondness I do for what my grandmother did for me. You are an amazing person and I hope you have an amazing day!",

My current room is in a tiny nook, closed off with blackout curtains, and having such an isolated place to go (with cute soft lighting and a white noise machine and a nice heavy blanket) has been *invaluable* for some of my sensory issues. Your grandkid is very lucky, OP! I hope when they're all tucked in that they feel so cozy and supported and loved. \ud83d\udc96",

A lot of people have to do things like put bars on windows but a safety bed is considered a more humane method - this one example is WAY better than some I've seen which are way too small.\n\nIt can also help if children are prone to flailing or seizures - it protects them from falling off the bed or hitting their limbs on hard surfaces. \n\nAlso can work as a sensory safe space. This one in particular I can see being a great sensory space since it is enclosed (a lot of safety beds are mesh covering).",

I recall that when my child was very little, there was an autistic kid in south Florida somewhere who was found wandering a downtown area alone in her pajamas, and they prosecuted that mom.  I think she had gone to sleep with hers and she herself was so exhausted she fell asleep and the kid just left.  My child was dx when he was 2 and people have no idea how hard it can be as a parent trying to figure out how to deal with elopement.  You kind of have to be superhuman.  I felt so much for every parent I read about in the news.  When my kid was 3 he just took off down the driveway and let me know in his own way he was headed off to the store.  That kid sprang from the womb with no conception that he was supposed to follow me around or follow my instructions or anything like that.  He wouldn't even let me swaddle him, that stinker!   He was a cute little dude (he's now almost 16) and I'm so proud of him but in HIS mind he has always been 100% entitled to 100% independence.  On behalf of all similar parents everywhere, thank you so much for your hard work to try to help those clients, even though you can't win them all.  That is hard work you are doing, and so important.",

We couldn't turn to shower or use the bathroom without an incident.  It was exhausting.  I don't blame anyone for falling asleep and the kid getting out.  For his room we installed a childproof top of door lock, childproof window locks (not technically fire safe but necessary for elopement), and we did a floor mattress and childproof outlets.  This is a much safer option.  He felt safe and loved in his room but needed this for safety when we slept.",

I carry the keys with me 24/7 and then lock those keys behind a combination lock when I go to bed. \n\nWe all live in a prison just to protect ourselves with, and from, one child.

Yes, this is a fire egress issue, but so is being mentally incapable of responding to an emergency on your own. Veil beds and seclusion are the equivalent used in a hospital. We do frequent checks when patients are restrained or confined, but I would assume this has some sort of video monitoring. No child, with or without a disability, is ever completely safe. Something like this is likely the safest option.",

Small quiet static spaces are heaven for kids who usually experience sight, sound, smell, taste and touch way more intensely than the general population. \n\nI\u2019m an autistic adult and I have to sleep with a blindfold, ear plugs, and a weighted blanket to mimic being in a dark quiet enclosed space like this. I cannot sleep otherwise. The smallest sounds like the air conditioner kicking on feel like they drill into my brain when I\u2019m trying to fall asleep.",

You're downplaying a lot of the positive feedback you're receiving, but you absolutely have earned it with this build. The bed moving in and out smoothly, the double doors, and the easily movable steps are all things that say this was considered from multiple angles for maximizing best outcomes for care and the special needs of your grandchild.\n\nI'm really glad you opted to share this, because this type of thing brings visibility to the challenges faced by people who are dealing with a disability or disorder, and the families of those people. Seeing how people's lives are changed in tangible ways shows much more about the challenges and the stories of these situations than just reading about it on a page.\n\nOne tiny piece of feedback, if I may, based on an accident I had as a child myself - I am not sure how heavy the steps leading up to the child's door are, or what other precautions you might have taken with them, but I might recommend some minor way to stabilize them. I kicked out a light stepstool out from under myself as a kid and took a spill, not to any majorly serious injury, but enough of one that I recall it thirty plus years later. Especially if he's on the younger end, he might still be lacking coordination that will help him safely navigate them, and it can be worse for neurodivergent children.\n\nAll the best for you and your family.",

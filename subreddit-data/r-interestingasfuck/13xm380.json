Last year in the playoffs, Chase Utley slid into the Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada in the playoffs to prevent a double play and broke Tejada's leg in the process (it was more of a jump kick than a slide).  This pitch by the pitcher was pretty obviously a retaliation pitch.  It was the first pitch to Utley in the game.  It was the first time Utley was batting at the Mets stadium since breaking Tejada's leg.  So the umpire threw the pitcher out of the game.  The ump could have warned him, but decided not to in this case.\n\nEdit: Should have said \"The previous year\" instead of \"Last year\".  This video is from several years ago.  Will leave mistake in.",

It was in fact a very late and dangerous slide, at least by the way the game is played and called in today's game. Utley deserved to get drilled and the Mets got the raw deal. They should have been given a warning, but judging by what was said in the video, I'm guessing the warning came before the game even started. There was probably a \"0 bullshit\" policy laid down in the dugout before the game started, knowing that retaliation was likely.  Usually in these types of situations, the retaliating team will just wait out the warnings for later in the season. I've seen pitchers drill players the next *season* as retaliation.",

The reason they want it gone is because of an agreement MLB has with the umpires that states \"interactions with microphone wearing umpires would never be made public\" - this video breaks that agreement and is also why you don't see videos with umpire audio very often. The rule was part of the umpires' collective bargaining agreement contracts, which went into effect back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.",

Most of the time people know it could be coming too and the umpires here clearly did. \n\nIf there was no previous beef and a pitcher just lost control of a pitch it wouldnt have warranted an ejection but given the context it was pretty clearly intentional. The majority of MLB pitchers have great control over their pitches so throwing it that far away from the strikezone couldnt be more obvious.",

            "comment": "for anyone unfamiliar with baseball... the batter, Chase Utley (in the grey), had previously injured a player on the Mets (team in white) when he slid into second base, breaking the leg of the Mets player. Mets players and fans regarded this as a \"dirty\" slide at the time.\n\nIn baseball, it's very common to retaliate for something like this, where, next time the player is at bat, the pitcher will throw a pitch at him, and usually hit him in the butt or arm or back as a form of retaliation. (edit: it's becoming less common. it was very common) (edit2: a hit in the butt isn't going to injure the batter. it'll sting hard though)\n\nSometimes, it's very straightforward, you hit my guy, next i'll hit one of your guys, and that's the end of the scrap. In this case, the umpires strongly anticipated that this retaliation was coming, and they didn't want a game of each pitcher just throwing ball after ball at opposing players. So they nipped it in the bud immediately and tossed the Mets pitcher after this pitch (throwing the ball behind a player like that is seen as an intentional and hostile move).\n\nWhen the Mets manager comes out to argue, you'll hear him say \"you gotta give us a shot\". In other words, this guy broke our guy's leg on a dirty play, you have to understand that we're going to retaliate. He also says \"they did nothing to that guy\", in other words the player wasn't fined or suspended for the play that the Mets thought was dirty. You'll also hear the umpire say \"you know where I stand on that\", \"they're coming down on us\", \"our ass is in the jackpot\" (this last line became a baseball meme). This all implies that the umpire might be sympathetic to the complaints of the Mets manager, but the league strongly wants to do away with these types of retaliation plays, so the league is strongly pressuring umpires to operate with zero/low tolerance for them, resulting in immediate ejections \"in this situation Terry!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlets go Mets!",

Dude basically runs / slides passed it to hit Tejada.\n\nAnd the clips of how bad baseball tackles used to be are WILD.  \n\nThankfully the video says they changed the rules afterwards so that you had to be GOING FOR THE BASE.

Behind the back is definitely considered an intentional attack because, for these pros, it is not where an accidental bad throw typically goes, and because a 90 mph hit to the kidney is one of the most dangerous hits in baseball. The damage can end a career as well as alter the batter\u2019s way of life going forward. \nAs a baseball fan of many years, I have to say it is amazing to watch a coach take up for the players.   So many times the players risk ejection for giving the umps lip (not the case here \u2018cause Skarsgaard was a goner) and a good coach knows how to push the right buttons to draw attention away from his player and yet not get himself ejected.  It\u2019s also an effective tool to get the adrenaline pumping in the dugout to up the effort.",

He goes through the whole log book of everything you've ever done to him. He's an ancient historian. You know, we all spend a lot of time worrying about that little man that's not really necessary . . . I've never seen him do anything funny. No, I take it back. I once saw him slip and fall coming out of the dugout. That was funny.\"\n\n\nAL umpire Nick Bremigan:\n\n\"Weaver just goes goofy like a raving lunatic . . . he's like a nightmare that just keeps coming back . . . raspy voice, 4-foot-2 . . . to me, he's the real ayatollah of the '80s . . . I think his bad relations with umpires hurt his club. Human nature tells you that. You're move of a man not to take it out on his players and I try extra hard not to. But human beings can be vindictive and umpires are human beings . . . His players think so, too. They've said to me, 'Oh, no, here he goes again. This isn't going to help us.' The question is, does he intimidate umpires or alienate umpires. How could you live with yourself if you let him intimidate you?\"\n\nBut at least Earl goes on to say, \"After all I've said about them over the years, callin' 'em incompetent and every other thing, it's only fair to let them say anything they want to about me. They've earned it.\"\n\n\nEarl definitely had a contentious relationship with them when he played, but I do wonder, once he retired, if things changed at all. \n\n\nIf you want to read more, click [here.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1981/05/20/umps-return-venom-on-weaver/6398726b-cf39-4fd8-8e05-02f9ecdd7e96/)",

Has there ever been a situation where they went \"Well, now that you've yellep at me, I can see that I've misjugded the situation. I'll take it back, you can stay, enjoy yourself!\"\n\nAnd if not, why do athletes keep doing it, if everyone knows its just theater ?",

The defender might get upset and tell the ref that he missed the offensive player committing a foul that precipitated the defenders action. The ref is unlikely to change the call in the moment, but in subsequent encounters between the same two players the ref may look at the situation differently and call a foul on the offensive player. This type of thing happens fairly frequently in the NBA and NFL.",

You're angry, you wanna yell, you're probably already thrown out so why not?\n\nD) Entertainment value. You have to admit it's amusing to watch.\n\nIt's probably some combination of the above IMO.",

There\u2019s no pressure to watch every game, but if you\u2019re sitting there bored in the summer there\u2019s always a game on\n\nAs a huge fan of most sports, baseball is my favorite. It\u2019s a nice change of pace from something like American football or European football",

    "postText": "It was the strident call of the tapir frog (its distinctive snout and other characteristics are similar in appearance to the Amazonian tapir) that led researchers to catch several specimens of this new species. Discovered in the Amazonian peatland of the Putumayo Basin in Peru, the hard-to-find frogs are fossorial, which means they burrow beneath the forest floor. And they\u2019re typically heard but not seen. Researchers kept hearing a sort of beeping noise from underground, leading them to suspect a new species of burrowing frog.\n\nThe very existence of the tiny tapir frog gives biologists hope for the Amazon region\u2019s health and biodiversity.\n\n\u201cThese frogs are really hard to find, and that leads to them being understudied,\u201d says Michelle Thompson, a researcher in the Keller Science Action Center at Chicago\u2019s Field Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of the Amazon\u2019s hidden diversity.\u201d",

            "comment": "Patients in the recent study were comatose and removed from life support, with their families' permission. At this point, electroencephalogram sensors measured the patients' brain activity as they went into cardiac arrest.\n\nThe researchers found that two out of four of the dying patients experienced a swell of gamma waves \u2014 the brain activity associated with lucid dreams and hallucinations \u2014 even after their hearts had stopped, [according to Smithsonian Magazine](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/surging-brain-activity-in-dying-people-may-be-a-sign-of-near-death-experiences-180982106/).  \n\nScientists have long thought that the brain dies with the rest of the body, but the latest study suggests that people may retain a certain level of consciousness that lends to dream-like, out-of-body experiences as they die. \n\n\"The discovery of the marked and organized gamma activities in the dying brain suggests that [a near-death experience] is the product of the dying brain, which is activated at death,\" the lead author of the study, Jimo Borjigin, told Vice. \n\n\"As far as I am concerned, our study may be as good as it will ever get for finding neural signatures of near-death consciousness,\" Borjigin told Vice, adding that the \"only thing better than this is to have the patients survive to tell the tale that correlates with the detected neural signatures.\"\n\nBorjigin has observed this same type of surge in brain activity in previous studies on dying rats, but it has historically been very difficult to examine in humans.\n\nThat said, Borjigin aims to collect more data on dying human brains in the future to better understand the human death experience, per Vice.",

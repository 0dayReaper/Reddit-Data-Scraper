The very least, they could've profiled a two income family struggling to make ends meet or how normal families are impacted by more expensive food, clothes and gas. \n\nMy wife and I have a two income family with one child. We live within our means, but childcare, inflation and home upkeep make it difficult to feel like we put enough money away, or stay on top of our debt. I feel like that's the more relatable story. FYI our monthly childcare payment is $300 more than our mortgage payment.",

One of the major things it mentioned that will \u201cimpact\u201d them is student loan payments, and then later in the article it says they have been paying down their student loans during the payment pause, so it won\u2019t actually change anything for them. And the wife is choosing to go back to working full time, so the expense of child care is a choice. I can kind of see the point they were trying to make, even if it\u2019s an old story by this point, but they picked the worst example family. Why not pick someone who might actually struggle?",

Presumably the mother makes more per hour as an assistant professor than the child care costs, so it's financially responsible for her to work. The father could of course choose to stay home instead, but neither you nor the article considered that. We all assume he makes more, because he's a man. But there's nothing that says he's less able to nurture the child at this age, or wouldn't find it emotionally satisfying, so while it would be financially risky it might be worthwhile in other ways for him and the child. \n\nI'm not disagreeing with your main points, just noting the inherent gender bias in the reporting and society.",

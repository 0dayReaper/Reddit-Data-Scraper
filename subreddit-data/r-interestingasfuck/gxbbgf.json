Not as much, but they *can* create pixels out of essentially thin air.  For text it's a bit trickier but it's getting better.  And for unblurring faces it can clear them up, usually the face is accurate too.  Sometimes the face does not look like the person like it should after the image is processed.\n\nIf it's video they actually can really really enhance things since there's all that temporal information.",

In 2016 the city held a referendum on the ballot asking if citizens would support DC making a formal petition for statehood and adopting a new state constitution, 86% of people voted yes.\n\nAs far as retrocession goes it\u2019s also an unpopular idea with residents in Maryland - since Virginia already took back their portion of DC a long time ago (the Pentagon and National Airport now sit on that land, among other things) retrocession proposals generally involve DC becoming part of Maryland. The unpopularity is mostly due to the fact that the DC metro area is far larger and more populous than either Baltimore\u2019s or Annapolis and would likely overshadow those two cities if DC became part of Maryland. \n\nThere are counties on the border with DC where I suspect people wouldn\u2019t have a huge issue with being merged with DC mainly because there are so many residents of those counties who used to live in DC but got pushed out of the city by gentrification and rising rents.",

Planet captures at roughly 4 m resolution whereas some other providers capture at sub-meter.  \n\nGoogle earth/maps is the better choice for most things you'd need a map for, but planet.com has it's niches as you can imagine. Google updates at a snail's crawl compared to planet.com, but they choose the best, highest res imagery and have even integrate the terrain view into the photo, which is pretty surreal in places like NYC. Their 'blanket of photos' that creates the map is all cohesive and seamless in terms of brightness and lack of cloud coverage. \n\nMost things I was looking at today for instance on Planet.com was blocked by cloud coverage. Couldnt see shit. Planet.com provides access to many different satellites, but you'll find maybe photos youre looking at are low res, or covered in clouds to the point you cant see the ground, or not able to zoom in enough. You have to do the work yourself just to find suitable photos. And even then they wont at all compare to Google's chosen photo for that area in terms of clarity. Even with my free trial, I couldnt view a lot of content because it wanted me to purchase it. I think they only give you access to a single satellite's imagery unless you pay.\n\nYou can see how they are both valuable tools though. You'd be lucky if google updates their photos every 6 months for a single address. Yet on planet.com you can get two photos a day, at minimum.",

I posted this in another forum a little while ago;\n\nOur police, all over the country, need to return to their core precepts of \"Protect and Serve\" instead of playing soldier. They need to look upon their fellow citizens as human beings instead of enemies to be crushed at every traffic stop. The use of fatal force has to become an *absolute* last resort, and if an officer kills someone they should not simply be given a paid vacation and eventually a pat on the shoulder and admonished to \"go get'm Tiger.\"  Derek Chauvin was involved in two police shootings prior to murdering George Floyd.\n\nThe lethal military hardware given to civilian police departments through the federal 1033 Program needs to go away (the program now serves 8,500 police departments countrywide). Further; every little berg in the country does not need a SWAT team, nor do police officers need training at US military posts in Surveillance and Counter-terrorism, those jobs belong to the federal government, and at this time there are multiple government agencies falling all over themselves to demand more money to do that very job.\n\nThe next time the Patriot Act comes up for review we need to rid ourselves of it. It's record for catching terrorists is abysmal, but it, and the Department of Homeland Security is doing a superb job of spying on US citizens and militerizing our civilian police.\n\nBack to Job One, police officers everywhere. Drop the attitude and no more war face, instead, try being civil to your fellow americans. Municipalities; remove their war making materials, they are NOT solders.",

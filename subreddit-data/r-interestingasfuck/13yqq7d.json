Sometimes an issue can\u2019t be fixed or problem determined without a pilot on board and sometimes a pilot can use their own discretion as to whether or not to continue. If you took your car in for a rattle and the tech says couldn\u2019t find a rattle then you drive off and the rattle comes back you immediately go back to the technician. The same happens with aircraft maintenance. Sometimes an issue can\u2019t even be determined until the fix is tested by the flight crew. All that said\u2026. For those afraid of flying, if this happens on your flight know that it\u2019s completely normal. It doesn\u2019t mean you almost died, or you were on a bad plane, or you can\u2019t continue on the same plane, sometimes it doesn\u2019t even mean there was a problem at all. Stay calm and don\u2019t be afraid.",

I do apologise for the inconvenience, but, as always, it is your safety before schedule, and as such, I think it will be necessary to return to the gate and have this aircraft inspected further. Now, as such, I do expect that we'll have to ask you to disembark the aircraft, and we'll have to make alternative arrangements for your journey to Sydney this evening. Once we've spoken to the ground staff with regards to that, you will be informed as to what arrangements will be made for you. As I said, I do apologise for the inconvenience.

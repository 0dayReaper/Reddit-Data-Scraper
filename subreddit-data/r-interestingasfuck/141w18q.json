Because bobtails mate after winter, not before (reminder to others: Australia is in the Southern Hemispheres). \n\nBobtails shouldn\u2019t be mating until late august at the earliest so I doubt that that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here if you just witnessed it today. \n\nBobtails are solitary animals for most of the year, coming together only to mate so that may be why they are circling each other, with\nThe female (smaller head) trying to stop the male (one with their mouth open) from latching onto her head/neck. The female knows that this is NOT mating time and a couple of nice days of sunshine doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s spring.\n\n\nI\u2019d really love to know when you saw this OP. I\u2019m fascinated!",

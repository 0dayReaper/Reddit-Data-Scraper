It took four months of on and off coding to complete it, but it is ready for download for anyone who wants to check it out for themselves.\n\nThe hardest part of this was dealing with the memory constraints of the calculator. The calculator only has 154KB of RAM. The continent sprites took up the most space, but by scaling them down, we got the entire game to fit into 17KB!\n\nThe game features a transportation view, a live, scrolling menu, mutations, and more.\n\nThis was a valuable learning experience. While this will NOT work on any calculator except the TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE, I welcome anyone to make a version for their calculator.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the source code: [https://github.com/EverydayCodeNet/CONTAGION-CE](https://github.com/EverydayCodeNet/CONTAGION-CE)\n\nDownload: [https://everydaycode.net/downloads.php](https://everydaycode.net/downloads.php)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions!\n\nEdit: This has gotten an overwhelming response!

You can imagine the impact my environment had on the way I learned to develop applications - - optimization wasn't just a fun challenge or something reserved for niche implementation, but a standard in day to day development. Furthermore, we had more limited access to libraries so there was no getting lost in higher and higher layers of abstraction. Learning to program then developed an intimacy with all the different parts of a computer system: it was the only way to become truly effective. I think you're doing yourself a huge favor with projects like this!",

Funny thing, the \"g-code\" FANUC came up with to run their machines and robots was based on the QBASIC language. Pretty sure they violated some copyrights using it as the framework, but it's so different only a QBASIC user would recognize the format.\n\nRemember the computer game magazines that had QBASIC code in them? I couldn't save the program cause I had no HDD and only 1 floppy drive, that Q-BASIC was running on. So I had to type out the whole code just to play the game once. You die, you gotta code again. lol Those were the days.",

They were able to get all sorts of wild shit on floppies with the right compression and coding. There was one guy that made a 17kb game. Something crazy small like that. It was in grayscale and had a miniscule resolution, but you could still move around in a 3D space with enemies. It was nuts. \n\nI'll try to dig it up.\n\nEdit - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger\n\nHere's the game that won first place. It was apparently 96kb (Wow!) but I definitely remember another competition from I think the late 90s where it was about what you could fit on a standard 3.5 inch floppy.",

I wonder if you might get away with writing a shim interpreter .. then you can port all the things to the calculator!\n\nCurious, what environment does the code run in? Is it sandboxed by the runtime (which I assume is a type of RTOS)? Are you running at system privilege or at some lower level? When your code gets execution does it take over all system resources (i.e. you \\_own\\_ the entire platform) or are you scheduled by a kernel (if it even has one).\n\nI'm interested in the overall architecture of how a calculator runs. Never really considered it being any more than a basic In/Out system,",

Not having a CS degree was never a barrier. \n\nI'm not saying you couldn't learn anything from CS courses, far from it. Just that you might not  *need* to learn that stuff depending on what you are interested in.\n\nIf I were you, I would consider majoring in something you are interested in and maybe taking a minor in CS or Mathematics. A professor I had summed it up nicely once: \"You can teach a rocket scientist to code, but you can't teach a programmer to be a rocket scientist\". \n\nTalk to real guidance councilors and not the old man yelling at clouds on Reddit, but for what it's worth, focusing on the field you want to do coding in might not be a bad idea.",

A CS degree just teaches you the fundamentals, not really how to code.\n\nI was thinking of going into engineering, so I could learn more of that side of the industry, but I'm not sure if I like it because you have to work with physical resources. If this YouTube thing ever works, maybe I could take some time to reflect.\n\nThanks again!",

Privately going without a team and without personal Sherpas is way cheaper. You still need to pay over 15 grand just fur legally climbing above Basecamp. Rest is pretty cheap if you bring your own gear wich you obviously already having it because of previous expedition",

So yes it varies a lot and if you already own equipment and you are already acclimatized, you can summit very cheaply. But if you are lets say a yound fit american who wants to summit everest and have never climbed over 7-8k meters, you are gonna need equipment and 1-3 personal sherpas which will cost well over $100k (I have heard the inflation has reached the Himalayas and Karakoram as well).\n\n I saw a documentary recently about a guy who almost died climbing Everest because he was rich but not fit, which is apperently very common, he had all inclusive service - 5 personal sherpas which cooked for him, carried stuff up the mountain, and 3 of them assisted the guy all the way to the top, where he collapsed, and the 3 guys literally had to drag his motionless body down the mountain. And this luxury service costed $155 grand back in 2016 or 2017, not sure about the exact year now.\n\nAt the same time there is a professional czech climber called Radek Jaros, who has summited all 14 8k+ peaks without oxygen or sherpas or any other help and I think he spent as little as $35-40 back around 2010ish to summit those mountains. Sometimes he even summited 2 mountains on a single trip (Lhotse and Everest I think, they are right next to each other and they even share the basecamp and first 4 high camps.",

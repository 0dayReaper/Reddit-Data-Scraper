Their expressions are so much similar to humans\n\nI don't know about similar, but dogs litteraly evolved in a way for them to better communicate with us. They have muscles on their \"eye brows\" and such (don't remember exactly) that wolves lack, muscles which allow dogs' very expressive eyes.\n\nBasically we must have favored the most expressive wolves when it came to food sharing at the beginning of cohabitation etc... which led to a positive feedback loop during their domestication into dogs, eventually leading them to be so expressive.\n\nDogs are fascinating because of how we evolved next and through each other.",

Different from a grooming lick or any of his other licks and he only does it after you kiss him or make kissy noises and ask for a kiss. So I'm convinced that he learned me kissing his face is a display of affection and adapted his behavior accordingly since I'm the only mother he's ever known and we don't have any other animals for him to learn behaviors from (don't worry we are getting him a friend soon).   \n\n[CAT TAX PAID IN FULL!](https://imgur.com/gallery/YeDVXdY)\n\n[BONUS SLEEPY CAT TAX REFUND!!](https://imgur.com/gallery/843Lz8K)",

But he eventually got used to the idea (but only when I'm laying down) and will come up for face nuggles. When he does that, he opens his mouth and briefly boops my nose/cheeks/lips with his tongue. \n\nLt. Frannington *loves* mutual grooming though. He grooms my ears and hair, then licks my hand with the expectation I'll stroke him. I got drunk one night and thought it would be *hilarious* to actually lick his head. To my inebriated horror, he enjoyed it. Turned his head this way and that to get just the right places.",

How is it weird that one of our near relatives likes to kiss too?\n\nPeople are denaturing themselves calling them animals, they're life just as you or I. They don't want to believe they're so similar to a gorilla.\n\nGorillas aren't like us, you're like a gorilla. Frankly there's humans I'd count this gorilla smarter than and you reading this are a part of that species. You're as much of an animal as they are.\n\nFor instance, the same kind of conditioning they're talking about in animals\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 bet they're still gonna be using Reddit after the 12th. What they call conditioning in animals, they'll excuse as an inconvenience in their own lives.",

Same with lenugo, the soft layer of body hair human babies develop in the womb, then (usually) shed before birth.",

They live a simulacrum of a true life, and I\u2019m positive they don\u2019t want to be there. \n\nThey are one of our closest cousins, even though they are not quite as smart as we are.

The death roll is usually taking part of a stationery body and shearing off parts of that body, right?  If you were in a full-on hug and could hold your breath, it seems like the forces wouldn't be as bad as a normal, although one may still not be able to hold on with all the thrashing about.",

There was actually a great variety of body plans and niches among crocodyloforms in South America, North Africa, and elsewhere during the Mesozoic.\n\nJust like its namesake, Armadillosuchus had bony plate armor shaped into bands like a banded armadillo's, and it seems to have adapted for a life of burrowing into the soil of its arid environment. \n\nThere were also the Metriorhynchids, crocodyloforms who lived in the ocean and whose feet evolved into paddles like a seal's front flippers, while their tails had vertical flukes like a shark's.\n\nThere were large mouthed crocodyloforms with strange teeth who might have gulped and expelled water to filter feed similar to how whales do, but scientists are unsure at the moment. It is plausible, since adapting to a new food source means they don't have to compete for prey with other croc species (and there were many).\n\nThere were also lots of crocodyloforms whose teeth had developed to grind plant matter, many of whom were quite small to reflect their position on the food chain.\n\nIt's just that all of those guys died out when their ecosystem could no longer support them. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

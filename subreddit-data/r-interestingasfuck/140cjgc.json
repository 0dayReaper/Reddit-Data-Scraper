Obviously it's still over the top, but they had to keep pushing the bar with each movie and they started getting further and further from that realism.",

Never mind the sheer volume of hits that he takes in the course of the fourth film, as the Hacksmith video clearly shows every hit reduces the effectiveness of the suit until it's effectively useless (and it doesn't take many hits to do so). \n\nBut it's less ridiculous than it appears on the surface.",

Well it\u2019s a complicated question that nobody here can answer definitively. First he was charged with manslaughter. Then the charges were dropped, and only the armorer was charged.\n\nSo if it happened in a situation like in the above video, who knows. There would probably be a complicated investigation in terms of who was at fault. And someone could be charged with manslaughter, or maybe no one would.",

The book didn't stop the bullet and he died. Monalisa took a deal in which she plead guilty to second degree manslaughter.",

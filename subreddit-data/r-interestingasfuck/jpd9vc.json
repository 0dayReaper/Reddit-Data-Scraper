There's not enough atmospheric pressure to allow for liquid water on the moon.  So how do you pick up this color though?  Is it just the long exposure?  You look at pictures from the moon expeditions and it's all gray.  Is this like pictures of Jupiter or various nebulae that use color to highlight different elements that reflect different parts of the spectrum?",

The Moon rocks the astronauts brought home for laboratory analysis were found to be bone dry \u2013 but we now know that those conclusions did not tell the whole story of water on the Moon. Beginning in the early 1990s, a series of orbiter and impactor missions began to piece together a more promising picture, culminating in NASA\u2019s 2009 discovery confirming the presence of subsurface water ice at the lunar South Pole.\n\nAh.

I.e., that's what you'd see with your eyes if you were actually up there, even though it can appear in many different shades from down here, due to how the atmosphere bends the light - from bright white, to yellow, to gray, to blood moons - the true color is best described as \"faded asphalt gray\", correct? (With some rare, green rocks known as Olivine, as well, apparently!)\n\nSo just to be clear because now I'm super curious, when you say saturation has been turned up, you mean way the fuck up to make it beautiful here? Or, if you went to the moon, would you say it's actually \"kinda brown-orange faded that sorta appears gray, but is definitely brown during the day\" or is it decidedly gray through and through?\n\nThat became wordier than I initially intended, I found it surprisingly hard to phrase this question in simple terms. English is not my native language :D\n\nEdit: read some of the other replies, I take it the moon is actually really gray and this has been edited (beautifully, might I add) for aesthetic/illustrative purposes, right? Still not 100% sure if I'm reading this correctly.",

The blue areas have \"a lot\" of titanium dioxide and the orange areas have \"a lot\" of iron oxide (aka rust). And by \"a lot,\" I mean a lot in relative geological terms. It's something we only notice thanks to advanced imaging and data analysis, and probably some samples from back in the Apollo days. It's not something you could detect just by looking at it. So the colors are \"real,\" they're just so subtle you need a fancy camera to notice. To your eye, it'd all look grey. This photo has been enhanced to to make that contrast way more obvious.",

I've managed some pretty decent images with just my big lens, D500 and the tracker! it's also super portable so great for when you want to get out and shoot nightscapes , if you were just looking to do deep space and planetary imaging and you have deep pockets, maybe go for something like a skywatcher HEQ5 and a proper scope and one shot colour astro camera. I think starting with fairly basic equipment is the way to go though. you learn to get good results with less then when you upgrade you're not totally out of your depth",

I suppose that's because it's a long exposure and it accumulates light over time whereas a telescope shows just a single instance. \n\nThis is a shot from my huawei p30 pro and a 120x refractor. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6yedZrm.jpg \n\nSee the chromatic aberration from the scope? And the atmospheric distortion? \n\nYour moonshot looks so 3D, what was your exposure time and your ISO settings?\n\nNot judging your photo btw. It's amazing and you absolutely should xpost it to /r/space /r/astrophotography and /r/telescopes",

After the first two or so times of missing death those that were spared started to believe they were impervious to the attacks. Every missed bomb only strengthened their belief. When they were asked to leave they refused because experiencing something like that was a once in a lifetime experience. Constant bombings do the opposite of what they are meant to do. Russia has failed to learn from the past. The human mind is kinda incredible. Obviously there were casualties from the war but only a tiny amount of people were directly affected by a death so fear never really permeated throughout the citizens of London.",

Why is this young man of fighting age at his home playing the guitar during an invasion of his country and not a soldier fighting at the front? This is by any means **not** criticism, just a honest question because i want to understand the situation. What exactly is happening in Ukraine when it comes to military conscription?",

You could play it as X03210, but it sounds better to me with the F on the low E (first fret) too to get that bass movement. Again, he\u2019s adding some embellishments in there too, like making the G string open or the B string open (that one sounds really nice to me, 1X3200)\n\nAnd when he shifts to that major chord, it\u2019s just a regular old D major.

            "comment": "\"The arrow used by Antonio Rebollo to light the cauldron during the Opening Ceremony was specially designed to support the flame and avoid the archer burning himself. It was made of tempered duralumin, weighed about 100 grams and was a little over a metre long. Several arrows were created to prepare for and carry out the performance, one of which is kept at The Olympic Museum in Lausanne.\"",

But I still managed to win. \n\nI really enjoyed the nostalgia vibes everyone showed though including myself.",

But just in case, he brought along a second arrow after extracting a promise from them that they would allow him another shot.\n\n&gt; It was not necessary. The arrow sailed over the caldron at exactly the right spot, passing through the gas from a jet inside to ignite the flame. Most observers thought Rebollo\u2019s arrow landed in the caldron, but that was never the plan.",

He's a bit of - if not comic relief then at least some dark humor.\n\nHe tries to be a good commander but doesn't have the strategic genius of Robb Stark.  He has to marry a Frey to secure a strategic alliance but he's worried about how pretty she'll be.  He wants his uncle's respect and constantly fails.  He orders his men to stand down in order to save them and has to live with the shame.  \n\nLike a lot of things his finale in the final season was really bad, and played for laughs, and I don't think I can forgive it.  For the rest, I agree that the book version was a much better and more nuanced character, but if you've never read the books I think his on-screen portrayal was fun and interesting.",

In the books he can't hit the shot cause he's still in deep grief and mourning for his father. Edmure from the books is the best Lord in the series probably, he actually cares about his people. He lets them into Riverrun to keep them safe, he defends the Riverlands at the Red Fork which dumbass Robb should've properly informed Edmure of his plans. In the show he is written as a fool but in the books he's actually dope.\n\n&gt;Edmure cursed softly. \u201cThe wind,\u201d he said, pulling a second arrow. \u201cAgain.\u201d The brand kissed the oil-soaked rag behind the arrowhead, the flames went licking up, Edmure lifted,\npulled, and released. High and far the arrow flew. Too far. It vanished in the river a dozen yards beyond the boat, its fire winking out in an instant. A flush was creeping up Edmure\u2019s\nneck, red as his beard. \u201cOnce more,\u201d he commanded, taking a third arrow from the quiver. *He is as tight as his bowstring*, Catelyn thought. Ser Brynden must have seen the same thing. \u201cLet me, my lord,\u201d he offered. \"I can do it,\u201d Edmure insisted. He let them light the arrow, jerked the bow up, took a deep breath, drew back the arrow. For a long moment he seemed to hesitate while the fire crept up the shaft, crackling. Finally he released. The arrow flashed up and up, and finally curved down again, falling, falling \u2026 and hissing past the billowing sail. A narrow miss, no more than a handspan, and yet a miss. \u201cThe Others take it!\u201d her\nbrother swore. The boat was almost out of range, drifting in and out among the river mists. Wordless, Edmure thrust the bow at his uncle\n\n&gt; **\u201cIt is no disgrace to miss your shot,\u201d her uncle told her quietly. \u201cEdmure should hear that. The day my own lord father went downriver, Hoster missed as well.\u201d**\n\n&gt; Last night in his cups he had broken down and wept, full of regrets for things undone and words unsaid. He ought never to have ridden off to fight his battle on the fords, he told her tearfully; he should have stayed at their father\u2019s bedside. \u201cI should have been with him, as you were,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he speak of me at the end? Tell me true, Cat. Did he ask\nfor me?\u201d\n\n- A Storm of Swords, Chapter 35, Catelyn IV",

It's awfully egotistical and, frankly, evil to think that humans have such an impact that even all of the innocent ones deserve to never experience life.  It's odd to find the difference of type of species that catch people's attention and cause humans to suggest the extinction of the human species as not only suitable solution but also the best solution. Some humans suck. Some humans are awesome.  Most humans are somewhere between awesome and sucky. The fact is, without humans, the universe would not be observed in the way it is now, and the beauty of a northern white rhino would be lost for infinity.  Not to mention, they are a subspecies of the white rhino and it's very similar cousin the southern white rhino are numbered in the 16,000s.",

It's resources wasted and should not be the face of the WWF. The peangolin would make a much better mascot. Cute, loving, and wants to exist unlike the fluffy freeloading fat-head f*** that is known as the panda.  Rant over.  We have increases the number of pandas, actually no longer considered endangered so that's nice for them.  Still more to do for them, which is wasted resources in my book. Sorry if you like pandas.

If an oil barron wants to suddenly stop destroying the planet it's not that the pollution would stop. Either another company would fill the gap or they'd be replaced by another oil barron who does grow the company for the investors. Greed has been and always will be human but it need not destroy everything in its way. I want workers to be greedy and take more pay, more power and influence from the capitalists. I want humans to be greedy for other things as well. Greedy for biodiversity for example. A billionaire doesn't really want the planet to burn, it's bad for business, but capital has only one single direction. It is not greed, it is the system.",

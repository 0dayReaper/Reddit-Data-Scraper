Current train between Toronto and Montreal is around 5 and 1/2 to 7 and 1/2 hours. And only a little cheaper than flying, which is theoretically faster but you lose a lot of time and they get to the airport an hour earlier and end up way out in the middle of nowhere in Montreal instead of downtown on the train.",

Even small communities had trollies, and towns and cities were connected via interurban rail lines. The highway system and the automobile, oil and tire industries displaced a lot of this and deliberately killed some of it. Freight now goes over the highway on trucks, which is vastly less effecient at scale but does allow for loads to go point to point without getting hung up at railyards and warehouses. However, what really allows all truck traffic to work is the massive federal and state subsidy of the highway system. See, rails are privately owned for the most part. The railroad owns the track and right of way and they pay to maintain it. Trucking companies only own their trucks and let the government pay to upkeep the roads, bridges and tunnels. They pay taxes too, more than most motorists, but it's way out of whack with the damage trucks do to the roads. The roads always look like shit because trucks, often overloaded, crush the roads. But the trucking companies don't pay for it so they don't give a shit. They've socialized the cost of maintaining their right of way, and the railroads have trouble competing with that. The railroads suck in massive and innumerable ways, but this is a massive hidden in plain sight subsidy to the trucking industry.",

Of course, there is always traffic, so the Acela (if running on time) is faster. \n\nThe trouble is getting to/from the train.\n\nYou need to drive to the train station, find parking, get to the platform before the train arrives, take the train and then get to your ultimate destination  somehow (since it probably isn't the train station) once you arrive. \n\nI had to visit NYC from northeastern MA. Destination was near Grand Central.\n\nI could drive 45 minutes plus some buffer for traffic, parking and geting to the train station and platform, spend 3 hours, 50 minutes on the Acela, then have to get from Penn station to over near Grand Central OR I could drive to Stamford, CT for 3 hours and take a 75 minute train ride and end up right at Grand Central.\n\nThe Acela runs along the CT coast, which has a lot of bends and isn't the most direct route from NY to Boston; if the rail line took a route more like I-84 across CT Acela would probably win station to station, but would still suck for my situation.",

The travel time between stations is about the same as the travel time on I95 without traffic.  With traffic the Brightline wins.  However, it\u2019s the commute to the station and from the station to your final designation that destroys any efficiencies.  Add the cost and driving is almost always a better time/economical saver.  If you lived in downtown Miami and for some reason needed to go to the Orlando airport, it would probably be a better deal plus you could work or relax on the train ride rather than drive.  However, if your party is more than 1 person, the cost for the 2 would be better to just drive.  As a result I don\u2019t know anyone who ever regularly or even every once in a while takes the Brightline.\n\nAlso, the route to Orlando, like you mentioned for the Acela, takes a terrible route following I95 and then heads west along the Beachline.   If the train followed the Florida turnpike, the travel time would be significantly shorter.  However, the track it is on is existing and the Brightline expansion was really used to just improve the route for freight traffic.",

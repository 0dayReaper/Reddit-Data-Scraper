There was one of those \"I did this\" stickers placed on a gas pump I use every day. Finally I got fed up seeing it and I wrote \"Fuck Trump\" on it. Next day the sticker had been removed. Oh, the hypocrisy-it's fine to deface a pump when it involves insulting the president, but not when someone writes \"Fuck Trump\" on the sticker that was there for a month. Also, there are \"FUCK BIDEN AND FUCK YOU FOR VOTING FOR HIM\" flags in a lot of front yards around here, so I doubt the language was the issue. Lol",

I didn't want to just drive and leave the poor thing there so i went to the nearest farmhouse and announce what i've done. Once i knock on the door a huge man opens the door, i instanty shit myself. Knowing i will get my ass kicked i decided to just go with the flow. \"good health to you comrade! Long live Tovaras Ceausescu!\" after thst, he, naturally, responded by saying the same. After a brief moment of silence i just come clean:\"do you know the pig is dead?\" to which he then tells me \"then let's drink!\"",

He dons a very good disguise and then hails a cab. After a few minutes of small talk with the cabbie, he leans in and says\n\n- Hey, comrade... Just between you and me... What do you think of Ceausescu?\n\nCabbie glances nervously at undercover Ceausescu for a bit, and then says\n\n- Not here. People might hear. Wait just a bit.\n\nAnd so they drive on for a bit, leaving the city center for the suburbs. Again, Ceausescu asks the cabbie. Again, the cabbie says there are too many people, they might hear, wait just a bit.\n\nSo onwards they ride, out of the suburbs, to the outskirt of the city. Again the same thing - Ceausescu asks what he thinks, cabbie says too many people around.\n\nThey ride for another two hours, past villages, past lonely farm houses, until finally the car pulls to a stop by a desolate, dusty dirt road, right in the middle of nowhere.\n\n- So comrade, Ceausescu demands again, now tell me - what do you think about that Ceausescu?\n\n- Honestly, the cabbie says, just between you and me? Best. President. EVER!",

Before joining the EU, the country was a shithole, tbh. Corrupt, shitty infrastructure, a lot of rights that no one took seriously, low standards in everthing, oligarchs. It was basically really close to being like Russia. I guess our luck was that Romanians historically really feared  what Russia's leaders might do and the EU was the only ally.\n\nNowadays, we see the same benefits in infrastructure, quality of life and this beautiful idea that your rights have to be respected. \n\nI love the EU, I see myself as an European first and I hope the Union only grows stronger.",

It all worked out and they survived the occupation. \n\nSo it sounds like these sorts of jokes aren't actually far off.",

All while she's pleading for help from the repugnant bitch that's watching these guys do this (I refuse to call her a policewoman nor a woman). They break her phone, I feel like they started to strip her, then they drag her away.\n\nHonestly... I wouldn't recommend even looking at the translated version. It's disgusting. And while I know that stuff like that happens and shining a light on it is the best disinfectant I still wouldn't recommend it. It made my skin crawl.",

They love encouraging the the masses in the West to be hypercritical of our own governments, morals and political alliances, while being hyper-questioning, 'neutral' and 'open-minded' about literal mass invasions and war crimes, tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nI completely support free speech, I am very critical about the things America and the West have done, I don't trust a lot of the actions we take and the stuff we do. But it is possible for free speech to be used as a weapon to sow dissent and fuel existing political tensions in a democratic country, and foreign authoritarian regimes are learning how to do it\n\nThis is a 21st century problem and an increasingly obvious flaw in democracy, and I don't see an obvious way to fix it\n\nEdit:descent -&gt; dissent",

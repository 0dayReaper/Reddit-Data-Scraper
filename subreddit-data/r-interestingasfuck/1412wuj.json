You guys are talking two different things. First things first: the video shows a fire. It's glowing, there's flame and air, no question.\n\nWhat he's saying is that the oxygen atoms present in wood (let's simplify to CH2O) can't oxidise any further. Which is true. Without any external air, it won't burn. It's called dry distillation, this is how they used to make fuels from wood.\n\nWood, however, can still go through carbonisation (which isn't oxidation) while giving off heat. Using the simplified formula this is CH2O-&gt;C+H2O. Based on Wikipedia, this can go up to 400C (750F). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonization\nThe lowest temperature needed for something to glow is a bit higher, 525C of 977F. I'd say for something to be called a fire, it needs to at least glow. So you would need air (or another oxidant) to burn wood. Wood by itself doesn't burn. The soil contains enough air to sustain the roots burning, as a comment below mentioned as well. (Think critters in the soil).\n\nThis part from [Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_distillation) sums it up:\n\nWood\n\nWhen wood is heated above 270\u00b0C it begins to carbonize. If air is absent, the final product (since there is no oxygen present to react with the wood) is charcoal. If air (which contains oxygen) is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400\u2013500\u00b0C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off. Until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100\u2013110\u00b0C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises, and at about 270\u00b0C, it begins to spontaneously decompose. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450\u00b0C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600\u00b0C.",

There's one reactant (CHO), but there are two products. Carbon is clearly not oxidized, so that's reduced, and it shames me to admit it, but it's so long since I used organic chemistry, so I'm not even completely sure about the next part, but since the \"bound\" HxO2x is at a lower energy level after the process, where it just turns into xH2O, I'd say it's been oxidized.\n\nThe \"which can go up to 400\" is unsourced on wikipedia, and I'm quite sure it's not true - after all, if you let in air, while you're making charcoal, it'll start regular combustion - the wikipedia article even says so: \"carbon monoxide, which is also produced during unloading through spontaneous ignition of the hot fuel\"  (in the sense that when they take the hot charcoals out of the retort, they can catch fire, because they're hot enough to do that).\n\nAnyway, if I'm wrong, it's because the hydrogen that's locked in cellulose isn't oxidized. I say it is. That a dry destillation *is* a fire, because one component of the cellulose, hydrogen, combines with another component of cellulose, oxygen. I'd say it's an oxidation reaction, and since it's glowing hot (I'll get to that), I don't think it's a crazy opinion. It lives up to the definition of fire.\n\nAs for the temperature, I'd like to quote a paper.  \n&gt; [Modern technology of dry distillation of wood\nMicha\u0142 LEWANDOWSKI, Eugeniusz MILCHERT \u2013 Institute of Chemical Organic Technology, Faculty\nof Chemical Technology and Engineering, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin\nPlease cite as: CHEMIK 2011, 65, 12, 1301-1306](https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BPP2-0015-0004/c/Lewandowski_GB.pdf)\n\nIn it, they go through the steps of a continuous dry destillation of wood, and near the end, before the cooling of the finished product, they write: \n&gt; \"The partly carbonized wood shrinks and moves down\nthe retort to the tempering zone. Here, at the temperature of\n500-550\u00b0C, charcoal in its final form is formed. However, the amount of heat generated is too small to maintain this temperature and to complete degasification. For this reason hot flue gas at a temperature of 500-600\u00b0C is fed to the tempering zone.\"\n\nSo, in this industrial process, the naturally occuring temperature is 500-550 degrees - so it even lives up to your demands, as it glows.\n\n----\n\nListen, I appreciate that there are specific words with specific meanings, and that we call this thing a dry destillation because it's a very specific thing. However, it's *also* a fire, and it's *also* an oxidation.\n\nSo: When there's intense enough heat, and the roots of trees are affected enough for the trees on top of them to catch fire, or when there's a chemical reaction that lets out a lot of heat in a dry peat bog, several meters down, where there's no oxygen, it's still a fire. Even if there are only flames once the reaction reaches the surface, and atmospheric oxygen is thrown into the mix.",

The heat from the fire cause the air to rise up inside the tree drawing fresh air inn from the bottom near the roots to feed the fire. The inside of the tree becomes very hot this way as the wood in insulating. So the relatively wet wood in the tree will dry up and catch fire. The outside of the tree is quite protected from the flames since the large open space would blow the heat away from the tree and the wood does not dry up in the same way and remain too wet to catch fire.\n\nIt is not evident from this video what caused the fire in the first place. The most common is lightning strikes. Due to the lack of air inside the tree it can burn for days like this before the fire breaks out and catch the entire tree on fire. A fire can also spread through the roots however this would require quite dry conditions and the roots would have to be almost dead anyway. It is not unlikely that the lumberjacks might have had something to do with this as well. The chainsaw have a very hot exhaust, especially if it backfires, and the area is full of sawdust and possibly spilled fuel and oil. They could have been felling a nearby tree and accidentally caught this on fire.",

That said, we had one advantage that made our jobs a lot easier. \n\nWe never had to worry about the direction it was coming down. I was always allowed to drop it in the direction it wanted to fall instead of having to coerce and twists it to avoid other trees etc. If there was a tree or something in it's way, I'd just remove that tree/object as well. Basically I could take down 5 trees, just to take down a single tree. I had complete authority to cut whatever I wanted.\n\nI have a lot of respect for arborists and people who have to work within the constraints of buildings, power lines, other trees, etc. You have to be a lot more confident in where it's going to go, and a lot more skilled to make sure it actually goes there. For me, a hangup because it didn't go the way I thought it would just meant another tree I had to take down, not a massive insurance claim and angry customer.\n\nAs for the fire, it looks cool but it really changes nothing from the perspective cutting it down except you just have to watch your bar doesn't get too hot. It's really just dropping a hollow tree with special effects.\n\nThe biggest danger was twofold. Branches would sometimes look solid but then just detach because they had burnt off. Basically camouflaged widow makers. Second, sometimes the roots had bunt out so much that you could just push these trees over with minimal effort.",

Can anyone with the know-how tell me why cutting the tree down is a better option than putting out the fire another way?\n\nIs it due to lack of access to water at the location or difficulty in the logistics of getting enough water to the tree in the middle of a forest? \n\nAlso, is there some sort of warning/identification system when this happens or is it just from observers on the watch? Are there people who\u2019s sole job it is to do this? Maybe they tag potentially susceptible trees/areas as a survey and keep a watch for strikes? I\u2019m curious because it doesn\u2019t seem like this tree has burned for long, and would be hard to identify in broad daylight, and so seems like it was caught pretty early.",

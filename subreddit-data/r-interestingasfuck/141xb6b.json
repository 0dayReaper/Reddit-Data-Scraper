It\u2019s inherently pleasant to the human ear. People naturally make music that sounds this way. No reason to think they plagiarized another song.",

You say so yourself in your post.\n\nPointing out the similarities is one thing - another is claiming an outright copy by saying it is \u201cshot for shot\u201d.\n\nThey are similar, yes. It\u2019s not shot for shot as claimed though. Shot for shot has a specific insinuation and context.\n\nIt\u2019s the same thing with Twitter labeling PBS and NPR as \u201cState-affiliated media\u201d, then turning around and being like \u201cno no we just meant it was (in part) funded by the government. State-affiliated media contains a very specific context.\n\nWords matter to people. If the OP had said \u201cthe Apple commercial is pretty close to Minority report\u201d that would be agreeable. Shot for shot not so much.",

It creates the shape you originally see, large bulb followed by a thin tail, as it rapidly cools in the water. Due to sciencey physics the bulb is hard enough to resist a .22 bullet shot at it, but if you flick the tail the whole thing explodes into dust.\n\nMelting the tail seems to have removed the pressure so it doesn\u2019t explode and the bulb might have retained some of it\u2019s strength. Or the glass is just strong enough to resist a light tap of a hammer",

            "comment": "There is a certain part of the video which is all over the web purporting this shark to be 40 feet long. A pacific sleeper shark can reach a maximum of around 20 feet in length. The cage is only 3 metres long and based on that, the sleeper shark is estimated at 7 metres or slightly bigger than that. It is still really huge...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe footage is at least 25 years old. It might still be alive for all we know as sleeper sharks have been recorded at over 100 years old. Below is the source.\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGk-yuYMAms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGk-yuYMAms)",

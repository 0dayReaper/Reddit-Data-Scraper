            "comment": "\"It consumes 1,660 gallons of heavy fuel oil per hour  \nWith both a six-cylinder and a 14-cylinder version, the two-stroke turbocharged low-speed diesel engine may look similar to the older RTA96C engine, but functions at a much more efficient level. It uses common rail technology \u2014 aka a direct fuel injection system for diesel engines \u2014 rather than traditional camshaft and fuel pump systems. This not only creates maximum performance at lower rpms, but also reduces fuel consumption and emits lower levels of harmful emissions. Pretty sweet, right? Here\u2019s more on that:  \nFuel consumption at maximum power is 0.278 lbs per hp per hour (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption). Fuel consumption at maximum economy is 0.260 lbs/hp/hour. At maximum economy the engine exceeds 50% thermal efficiency. That is, more than 50% of the energy in the fuel in converted to motion. For comparison, most automotive and small aircraft engines have BSFC figures in the 0.40-0.60 lbs/hp/hr range and 25-30% thermal efficiency range. Even at its most efficient power setting, the big 14 consumes 1,660 gallons of heavy fuel oil per hour.\"",

In water, you have to handle the dust almost directly to be affected by it. You can swim in a pool with a reactor in it and be fine due to how water shields against that radiation.\n\nThe solution to pollution is dilution. Add water until it stops being a problem, and the ocean has a lot of water to add.",

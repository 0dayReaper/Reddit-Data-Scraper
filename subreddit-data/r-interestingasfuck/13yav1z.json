Nothing like racing against competitors between the armco barriers on a Belgian street, topping out at 180mph on the straight as the wind and power of the engine is slowly pushing you out the back of the platform with every gear change, leaving you questioning when the braking zone is coming that pings you back to where you should be before you get ejected at that speed - all with a huge smile because it\u2019s just that bat shit crazy :)\n\nEdit: A lot of people get into it because it\u2019s a comparatively very cheap way to go racing to a high level within the sport.",

I've got a few thousand hours on iracing and am an OK road circuit racer, usually make the top split in most categories. Oval racing, I'm shocking. I reckon I would need the same sort of time I've put in on road circuits to be decent. \n\nWhat you don't get in cornering skill and car control, you make up for in situational awareness. Doing 200mph for 2 hours+ with cars on every side of you is a real mental effort.",

What people don\u2019t realize is that if a track is \u201ceasier\u201d to drive, that means it\u2019s easier for everyone. At the end of the day, you\u2019re racing against other drivers, not the track. So even though ovals are technically easier to drive in the sense that it\u2019s easy to get around it without crashing, you still need to find a way to make lap time up better than your competitors. And that\u2019s still a talent. \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why certain drivers are generally up at the front pretty consistently.",

I was always at the right RPM at that spot. \n\nI don't doubt the more enthused of the drivers would spend way more time than I have, on more tracks (NFS was 9?), etc. I didn't even get the million$ they do.

Mad/sad that Dirt3 doesn't have that, and a few others I really like(d).\n\nSince you stuck your head in, I'll ask: I bought a new wheel several years ago because my awesome old one was in a flood and got ruined. But this new one doesn't have springs or whatever makes the wheel go back to center if you twist it and let go...it's required that the game handles it? There's no resistance otherwise, and I can't do a grip-release-grip. I don't like that at all. I want that to be \"analog\", if you will. No interest in FF. Is there a wheel nowadays that has that?",

It's rack and pinion and you need to have a lot of strength to hold on to the wheel and *surgically* send it through a corner, while dealing with those G forces. Most people wouldn't be able to hang on to the wheel through the first few corners (assuming they manage to launch successfully), but these guys do it for hours a day, 3 days through the weekend, up to 3 weekends in a row, with strength training in between.

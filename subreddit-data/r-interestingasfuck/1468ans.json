It was rated for 930 hp @ 10000 rpm, but it was cautiously de-tuned to 750 hp @ 9000 rpm to improve reliability.",

Even watching the top dawgs at a relatively well respected drag strip, we're generally surprised by how slow it LOOKS, but then it runs an 8s quarter and you're like huh. The mark of a really fast car is when it does look that fast, and i'm thinking only of like awd drag cars that can launch into 60mph almost instantaneously. Even those tend to top out at lower speeds than rear wheel drive cars, so the end time result isn't much different, it just looks much more violent with the instant start than the slower build on the RWD.\n\nAnyway, point is, perspective matters, and cars specifically have to be really specialized to seem that fast.

While their height is impressive, the real wonder of a giant sequoia lies in its bulk. Many of these giants have diameters in excess of 30 feet near the ground, with a corresponding circumference of over 94 feet!\n\nThe largest tree in Calaveras Big Trees State Park is the Louis Agassiz tree. It is located in the South Grove. This tree is \"only\" 250 feet tall, but it is over 25 feet in diameter six feet above the ground! The largest tree in the North Grove is probably the Empire State Tree, which is 18 feet in diameter six feet above the ground.\n\nhttps://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1146#:~:text=Many%20giant%20sequoias%20are%20between,circumference%20of%20over%2094%20feet!",

And even the dinosaurs had to walk quite a bit to get around them. Or think just about the insects! Centipedes, big as a bicycle, seem just as small as nowadays on bark this size.\n\nThat's how scary woods actually were long ago until catastrophes, drastic changes in climate and in the latest timeframes the humans started to destroy them en masse.

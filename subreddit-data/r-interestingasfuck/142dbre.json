It appears somebody removed the projectile and re-powdered the cartridge considering maybe the old powder in there was bad. I mean you probably know that and you could be right that they could have been improperly made but he thinks there may be some foul play at work or some unintentional mishap after the manufacturing process, also I'm just guessing they could have been re-powdered but what else could make a round do that? Overall just really unfortunate but very fortunate that he survived!",

He was able to order the brass cases from somewhere for a little over $50 each. \n\nThe brass is reusable. Not sure how many loadings you will get from the brass but lets go with a low number and say 5 times each. That gives a round number of $10 per shot for the brass amortized over the life of the brass.\n\nThe lead projectile is quite cheap, especially if you have a bullet mold and pour them yourself. 4 bore is traditionally a 1/4 pound lead ball. Upper end price for lead is $2 per pound. So call it $0.50.\n\nThe gunpowder in the case varies but ive seen on some reloading forums about it of someone using between 300 and 450 grains of black powder. Assuming $30 per pound and there is 7000 grains per pound. Powder is between $1.25 and $2 per shell. \n\nThe primers have gone up a ton in the last few years, but lets assume 7 cents for the primer on the middle to upper end for shotshell primers. \n\nSo loading them yourself puts it about $13 each shot with the majority of that being the absurdly expensive specialty brass.",

I know some full brass shotshells are made on a lathe. The brass is also thicker than drawn brass and lasts a lot longer. I have some lathe turned .410 shells that I\u2019ve shot probably 15 times and they are still working great. The 5 reloading figure I said in my last comment is probably way too low for machined straight walled brass.\n\nBut if you have a lathe and can machine them to good enough tolerance, it would be cheaper yeah.",

            "comment": "I have a copy pasta related to this i think. One sec... here we go, found it! It might not be the same gun, but it gets the point across\n\nThis is the .950 JDJ Fat Mac. It is a 100 pound, 5 foot long rifle that shoots a one pound solid brass bullet at 2200 FPS. It is a non-NFA item only because the ATF gave it a sporting exemption as a joke as if anybody is going to hunt with this. This round would be overkill for hunting blue whales.\nI would like to paint a picture for you. It's 2AM and you hear a window break in your living room. This is the worst day this could happen, as every single one of your guns was lost in a tragic boating accident this morning. All were lost except for one. You look across your room in dread at your anti-kaiju rifle. You know what you have to do, but you don't know if you have the strength to do it, both literally and figuratively.\nHeaving the rifle into your arms, you load a .950 cartridge and begin to waddle towards the door. Your feet make a loud \u201cthud\u201d as you take each 6\u2033 step. You know the intruders hear you. You hope they do, for perhaps they will run and spare the world the suffering that is about to befall it.\nYou try to set the rifle down, but end up clipping your bedroom door and it is immediately knocked off its hinges by this battering ram in your hands. You attempt to round the corner, bonking the muzzle against the doorframe and adjacent wall across the hall at least 4 times. To your horror, two invaders stand there at the end of the hall.\nWith a heavy heart, you raise the rifle to your shoulder while making inhuman grunting noises from the strain of attempting some semblance of a shooting position. The burglars simply stare in disbelief, unable to process the situation they are witnessing, as if in a dream. You cannot aim the rifle, as the last time you fired the gun, it turned your $3000 Leupold into a kaleidoscope. You simply hold it at an angle that appears correct and fire.\nYou are immediately knocked to the floor as if hit by a semi truck going 20 MPH. The shot connected with one of the criminals and it erased him from existence. Even the memories of him have been destroyed and you're wondering why you just shot into an empty hallway. The shot continues to travel through at least 4 houses, a car, and a 10 ton boulder before lodging itself 20 feet into a nearby hill, never to be seen again.\nIt is at this point, you realize you cannot hear. The surviving burglar can't hear either but he's also on fire from the muzzle blast and is currently vacating your home. You don't care. Your shoulder is dislocated and there is a hole in your brand new AR500 refrigerator. You're crying now. The police arrive and, upon seeing the scene, start laughing. You start crying harder.",

They particularly had trouble with Elephants, Rhinos, Cape Buffallo, and Gaur. The 4 bore had 300 pounds of recoil. The article I found compared it to ship's swivel guns of the day, a 4 bore swivel gun would rip itself out of the railing on firing. Thing's a cannon. Most people settled for an 8 guage as that was the most gun most people could handle.  \n\n\nhttps://americanshootingjournal.com/4-bore-rifles/",

This forces all other protesters to be left outside the park, along to other main streets and roads, with other vehicles.*\n* What's the solution? *The organiser suggested a tactic, \"water flow\", which asked protesters to first fill the park area, then slowly leave the park to allow protesters outside to come in.*\n* Why being peaceful? *The government said protesters are \"rioters\" who \"have no stake in the society\", simply ruining their home. Protesters hope to use a peaceful method to see if the govnt. would ever respond to the demands, and of course, to show that protesters aren't rioters.*",

Basically a location like the National Mall between the Washington Monument and the Capitol Building in the heart of Washington DC, in the US, that you see all the big outdoor events.  \n  \nIn 1986, a movement grew among chinese students of some of the most elite universities.  Remember, the Chinese culture looks up to the best students, fast tracking them to the highest goverment positions.   This movement saw the authoritirianism of the government and the rapid expansion of materialism (this is when china started allowing capatalism in certain areas) and wanted the government to back more towards the communist ideals of the first leader, Chairman Mao (died 10 years earlier).  Basically, they wanted the communist government to be more communist.  Various protests grew in intensity and size for several years leading up to 1989.  \n  \nThey held a protest in Tiananmen square.  That gathered 10s of thousands of students.  Eventually the government grew tired of this, ordered the army in, surrounded them, and proceeded to murder them. Peking University leaflets circulated on campus suggested a death toll of between two to three thousand. The Chinese Red Cross had given a figure of 2,600 deaths.",

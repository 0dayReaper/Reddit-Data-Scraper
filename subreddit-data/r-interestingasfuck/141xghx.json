            "comment": "Actually, it doesn\u2019t involve the sea.\n\nIt is caused when highly fluid molten basalt intrudes through geologic formations to form an extensive volcanic plateau. As the lava cools, contraction occurs and horizontal contraction fractures in a similar way to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass cools, leaving pillarlike structures, which also fracture horizontally into \"biscuits\".\n\nIn many cases, the horizontal fractures result in a bottom face that is convex, while the upper face of the lower segment is concave, producing what are called \"ball and socket\" joints. The size of the columns are primarily determined by the speed at which the lava cools.\n\n[sciencedaily.com](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081216104325.htm)",

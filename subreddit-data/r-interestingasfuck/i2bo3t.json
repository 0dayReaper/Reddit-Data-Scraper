He flees past steaming pots and kettles, overturning food carts, strewing pans and silverware behind him, flour flying, rolling fruit and cans cover the floor. Bad guys slip and stumble, crashing into steel shelves, ducking hurled knives as your doctor throws new meds at your cancer. I'm on immunotherapy, but have had to supplement with one surgery and caustic chemo a couple times. Anti-barf pills work!  Four years on I'm still ahead in this chase and hugely enjoying life.\n\nThe metaphor for my cancer cells had to change too. They are not foreign invaders. They are my own fucking little overachievers, the pro athlete wannabes of my body. Spike their Gatorade! Sugar-tank their team bus! Put itchy powder in their socks.\n\nThe best-winning strategy of all: I applied for and got euthanasia meds. Buncha morphine basically. This is mercifully legal in just nine U.S. states and D.C.

Just wanted to explain so things for anyone surprised by the idea of euthanasia in the context of terminal illness. The legal term used in most jurisdictions is \u201cmedical aid in dying.\u201d As a doctor who participates in the California End of Life Option Act we are actually very careful not to use the word \u201ceuthanasia\u201d when referring to the drugs prescribed for medical aid in dying. From a legal perspective euthanasia refers exclusively to medications _administered_ by a healthcare provider, e.g. a doctor injects a fatal dose of a medication. As far as I know this is only legal in the Netherlands. Medical aid in dying (which is often described as physician assisted suicide by those opposed to the practice) is a process by which a patient is evaluated by typically 2 physicians to ensure that they have a terminal disease, are of sound mind to independently make the decision to request a life ending drug, are not being coerced into such a decision, and are physically capable of administering the drug themselves. The drugs are generally a powder that is mixed with water and either consumed orally or pushed through a feeding tube. The key and very important difference between euthanasia and medical aid in dying is the fact that the patient must administer the prepared drug without any assistance.  Medical aid in dying is intended to provide terminally ill patients the mercy of choice, rather than to insist they suffer needlessly through a disease that we know will claim their life. In fact, patients who take a medical aid in dying drug will not have that fact listed on their death certificate, nor will the death certificate list suicide as a cause of death. The terminal disease remains the de facto cause.\n\nHope that clarifies some things! I hope that this option continues to spread through the rest of the US, as it really does give participants so much peace of mind, even if only a portion of the patients who fill the prescription actually end up taking the medication to end their life.",

The palliative care oncologist who helped me was wonderfully open-minded and humane. California is my state. Sorry if I didn't employ the preferred euphemism for euthanasia. Here it's called End-Of-Life Option meds, I believe.\n\nI'd like to add a couple other harder facts for those reading. The first pharmacy I was referred to for these meds planned to charge me $500 for it. For some reason they fell through. The second pharmacy the palliative care doc referred me to announced it would cost $700. That's what I paid. I'm not sure palliative care doc was aware of 2nd pharmacy's rate hike. But the biggest surprise of all was the pharmacy (not the doc!) informing me, \"Oh by the way, this formulation EXPIRES in six months.\" \n\nSo there is a definite financial rape angle involved for terminal patients seeking their end-of-life peace of mind the legal way: *$1,400/year* in California, *every year* more that you hope your life lasts. (Note guns are way less expensive than this. Just sayin.)\n\nAlso taking a big morphine dose through the digestive system isn't the best way to ingest morphine, injection would be a lot faster. Orally is a work-around because the patient, as you pointed out, has to self-administer the medication. \n\nDoctors are used to morphine. But there are faster, surer drugs for the job: sodium pentobarbitol. But that one's so effective it got made illegal in the U.S. A fentanyl overdose would also work quickly and well, but again illegal. Veterinarians are experts at mercifully putting animals to sleep. But again, that drug's not approved for putting humans to sleep. \n\nSo we end-of-life patients are stuck with oral morphine because it's familiar to the medical establishment, not because it's the best drug administered in the most effective manner that drug could be.\n\nPalliative care doctors also do not discuss inhalation of nitrogen, helium, carbon monoxide, or inert gas with their patients. They should.  It would save us a lot of research. (I suspect it's not allowed for you to).  It is effective. Key point: for patients there is no sensation of panic. Suffocation panic is caused by an excess level of carbon dioxide in the body, and that is not how inert gases work. They just quietly link up to your red blood cells where oxygen ought to go. First you pass out, then your brain stops getting enough oxygen, and you die in your sleep.  Nitrogen and helium tanks are cheap. Except for the indignity of passing away with a plastic bag over your head, I see taking a sedative and breathing inert gas as a peaceful end-of-life option. \n\nOur culture still has taboos and a lot of religious baggage when it comes to discussing death. Having these discussions even anonymously online is difficult. I try to help by being open with my family and friends about how much peace of mind access to End Of Life option meds gives me. \n\nThis was a long text. Thank you for reading.",

Many of the drugs that were used in the past have been voluntarily pulled from the market by manufacturers because they don't want to be associated with the medical aid in dying movement. And you're right about the difficulty of utilizing oral drugs for this purpose. Worse still is that even transmucosal fentanyl would be prohibitively expensive and difficult to administer in sufficient quantities, especially for patients who already have significant opioid tolerance. To the point regarding inert gasses I would be very interested in seeing how this could be implemented. One significant roadblock would be the provision in the EOLOA law that the  \"drug\" cannot be consumed \"in a public place\". Which has basically been reduced to no location other than a private home. Inert gasses would likely require some equipment that may be difficult to implement in this regard while still complying with the law as written. Hopefully this will improve in the future though. My institution is sponsoring an End of Life Symposium for discussion of topics like this. I will do what I can to ensure your voice is heard.",

We\u2019d gotten used to drugs costing five or ten thousand dollars per month, most new drugs are about $15k per month. For one drug. On top of that, some patients require growth factors to support the immune system, Neulasta is $5k per injection and most patients get four injections. Add on antiemetics, iron drugs, pain meds, etc etc. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t count the cost of surgery, radiation, labs, imaging, office visits. Cancer patients make up less than 1% of a commercial population, but account for 10% of all costs. \n\nWhat about this new one though, CAR-T cell therapy. Might want to be sitting down for this one. They are generally in the range of a half million. Kymriah in particular is interesting, they charge $375k for adults, and $475k for kids. You read that right, they charge more for the same therapy for kids, because fuck you. \n\nBut make no mistake, these are very good therapies. People are floating the C word - cure, not that other C word. So, what\u2019s it worth to cure a child of leukemia? That\u2019s a very difficult question. Exercise for the reader, I\u2019ve rambled enough without going further down the rabbit hole of US healthcare.",

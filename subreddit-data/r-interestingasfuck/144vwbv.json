And it looks so smooth, his grip release, both hands simultaneously.\n\nI know it\u2019s not fake, but I wonder if it was a spur of the moment suicide decision",

He was paid 15 grand to climb the building he\u2019s a daredevil that did shit like this often. You can clearly see his arms start to shake so he tries using his foot to support himself but he lost all power in his arms and fingers. If you\u2019ve ever climbed something using mostly your upper body strength eventually your hands and fingers go numb and then the panic sets in and depending on the person you start desperately using your feet to find a foot hold. Unfortunately for this guy his luck ran out.",

I\u2019m describing what I perceived when I watched it. \n\nIt\u2019s strange is all - is it the literal last moment of his climb too? \n\nLike he made it up 64 stories, and then right at the last moment, literally gripping the top, he loses his ability?\n\nI\u2019ve climbed shit and been hanging on for dear life and when I was met with panic it gave me strength to perform absurd feats in order to make it up and not down. But I\u2019ve also been in situations where I faced death and the realization of it along with immediate overwhelming panic turned into freezing/non-action/almost blacking out level snap! no control type feeling so I can imagine this panic setting in rendering him unable to grip, but it\u2019s the foot + movement that makes it surreal.  \n\nLike, these videos I usually get an uncomfortable feeling like oh shit nooo, but this one it\u2019s just like - hM, there he is, oh I damn guess he\u2019s peacing out",

                    "comment": "&gt;Related to this, part of the intimacy with nature that you acquire, is the sharpening of your senses. Not that your hearing or eyesight become more acute, but you notice things more. In city life you tend to be turned inward, in a way. Your environment is crowded with irrelevant sights and sounds, and you get conditioned to block most of them out of your consciousness. In the woods you get so that your awareness is turned outward, toward your environment, hence you are much more conscious of what goes on around you. For example, you\u2019ll notice inconspicuous things on the ground, such as edible plants or animal tracks. If a human being has passed through and has left even just a small part of a footprint, you\u2019ll probably notice it. You know what the sounds are that come to your ears: This is a birdcall, that is the buzzing of a horsefly, this is a startled deer running off, this is the thump of a pine cone that has been cut down by a squirrel and has landed on a log. If you hear a sound that you can\u2019t identify, it immediately catches your attention, even if it\u2019s so faint that it\u2019s barely audible. To me this alertness, or openness of one\u2019s senses, is one of the greatest luxuries of living close to nature. You can\u2019t understand this unless you\u2019ve experienced it yourself.\n\nThese are not ramblings of a madman. An eccentric person, yes. Ever since being a young child, he wanted to live alone in the woods, and he did for a time. However, civilization kept encroaching in, IIRC the trigger was seeing one of his favorite forests felled to make way for a road. So he decided that something must be done, to try and bring an end to our way of life before it destroys everything.\n\nHis main points are the following:\n\n* Technological progress is carrying us to inevitable disaster.\n* Only the collapse of modern technological civilization can avert disaster\n* The political left is technological society's first line of defense against revolution\n* What is needed is a new revolutionary movement, dedicated to the elimination of technological society\n\nTechnological society is, broadly speaking, extremely abnormal and temporary. It is entirely based on one-time spending of Earth's natural resources such as fossil fuels and metal ore deposits, and once they are mostly gone, it runs out of resource flows to sustain itself, and all its machines and such stop. The biosphere that should carry the human population in the future will in turn be much diminished by global warming, loss of habitat, and other pollution. For humans, it will be a bad time, as most of our food comes from industrial production and is transported all over the globe.\n\nThe path to sustainability involves less of everything. Less population, less consumption, and so forth. At this time, where we must be at Peak Energy, we are likely forced to find the path towards that future that Unabomber would have wanted to start 50 years ago.",

Ultimately, to survive, humans will have to leave earth and populate other planets to reduce the risk of world ending events - meteor/comit, natural disasters, gamma ray bursts, solar flares ect. To do that, we need resources and technology, and we will run out. I don't think there is ever life without conflict or a perpetual state of balance.",

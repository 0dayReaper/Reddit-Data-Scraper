You have the American and UK kind where it makes it so that the people feel like they have a say in everything, because the system is 'let them talk shit, as long as the money rolls in for war games we're all good'.\n\nBut then the likes of China and Russia have a much more controlled and shut off approach. Do what you're fucking told and you get to go home.\n\nThey all crack the whip and its the people who pay the price and not the system.",

Every single person acknowledged knowing about it from their parents, but only one person was comfortable enough to talk about it with me.\n\nMaybe it's a rich people thing?

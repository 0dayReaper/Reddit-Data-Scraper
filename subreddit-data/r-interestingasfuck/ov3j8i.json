It was an elementary school campus so he would have to go all the way off of the campus. She told him if he left we would have to lock the doors and he couldn't come back. I remember seeing him walk away with debris whipping all around him.",

Sometimes you have to make a judgement call about what's going to cause the most problems, and sometimes denying people an outlet for their anxieties will lead to some pretty scary behaviors.",

It\u2019s a coping mechanism, a comfort thing, borderline self-medicating. Pretty dangerous to cut someone off of that in a dire situation.",

I quit smoking with the help of vaping about 4 months ago after 20+ years of smoking. I think about smoking all the time because of my anxiety. The ritual of it is also a huge part of my addiction. It was easy transitioning from cigarettes to vaping. I know it's going to be extremely hard to go from vaping to nothing at all, which is ultimately my goal.",

People who haven\u2019t smoked don\u2019t really understand how hard it can be to quit. The ritual of it is a big part for me as well. 9 months and 12 days since I\u2019ve had a cigarette. I quit smoking by vaping once before but I started smoking again if I was drinking. I had quit for over 2 years and nearly stopped vaping as well. I had a lot of stressors in my life before that contributed but have no desire to smoke or drink now. I\u2019m sure I will eventually use my vape less and less like the first time around. You may find that it\u2019s easy for you too. I hope so!",

The following link is full of insightful information regarding chock jumping and tie down pads and concrete anchors. During winter at some airports its far simpler to forklift anchors into position then it is to dig through layers of ice to find an anchor in the ground. If the winds are in the wrong direction then it can be too dangerous to open a hangar door. If the airport is small or remote enough then theres a good chance there isnt any hangar space available. Even the largest aircraft are susceptible to extreme wind conditions. In the warmer climates you can see a storm coming for days and reasonably predict storm fronts. In other climates where the dew point spread is lower a drop in wind speed will require a new forecast to be issued. In areas with valleys and cliffs unexpected temperature changes will require a new forecast to be issued. Ive seen airports go from 15SM clear forecast change to 1/8 and 100vv in an hour. And ive seen airports report winds at 5 knots on the ground with 52 knots low level windshear and icing at 250 meters. A slight change in direction with that forecast would tear the wings off a plane.\n\nhttp://www.avcanada.ca/forums2/viewtopic.php?t=129922\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=cHhZwvdRR5c",

That's a thought made of nightmares. \n\nI always wonder how loud it would be if one fell. Anyone who's worked on aircraft know those doors fucking suck ass. They'll work for a week and a motor will burn our or someshit then you have to push it manually. Don't push it too fast or it will jump the stop. \n\n9/10 When you're in the navy, at the end of the day, the most green sailors close the doors. A friend of mine was closing a door at one point, it hit the stop hard enough to tilt the door and a tie down or bolt of some sort fell and landed on the top of his head. He needed a shitload of stitches but ended up suffering from TBI. Good thing he had it documented.",

That alone certainly isn't a world of difference, but there may be a bit more to it. \n\nFrankly, I suspect that the entire undercarriage is modern as the cabs seem to be typically mounted on railroad cars or other wheeled carriages in the historical examples.\n\nBut yeah in principle steam engines can be quite capable. The problem isn't necessarily performance, but cost, weight/size, fuel consumption, difficulty to operate, startup time, and reliability/durability. So  literally everything else.",

It made me recall the same Steam Shovel models used were still operational.

Despite that, they are still steam powered and it pretty much still works the same way. Here's the [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiclPVvCYDk) of the video here.",

Bottom trap door buckets are still commonly used on loaders, transfer cars, etc. in industries that deal with loose bulk material, like coal/coke(for steel production)/agriculture/grain.  Modern excavators dig down into material and are able to exert much higher forces than this design, making it better suited for removing compact material.  The buckets are designed to be durable, and strong enough to ensure the maximum mechanical advantage of the hydraulic arms can be utilized.",

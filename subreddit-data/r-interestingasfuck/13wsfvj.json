At its earliest origins, barbecue involved slow-cooking meat over sticks and saplings, a common activity among indigenous Americans and Caribbeans\n\nEVERYTHING that the Fuckers produce (Except Dolly, we all love you darling.) is just piggy backing on the work of others. Which is FINE but don't act like you invented it! It's like when people say Europeans invented Algebra. No, they didn't, it's Al-Jabr, the way of completion. Invented by Arabs, credit to Arabs.\n\nFuck, why do these people all wanna eat up anyone's achievements. It's a sickness. Ask Rosalind, excuse me, Dr. Franklin, where it leads. \n\nThese fuckers take over things and their mouth breathing kids *just go with it* because they either do not or cannot recognize that we all stand on the Tower of Giants.\n\nIt's just so fucking sad..",

The Slave States used the Federal Government to subjugate the northern states.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it so that escaped slaves had to be returned to their former owners - even if they had made it to a free state. Federal Agents could and did pursue ex-slaves and override local laws of the Free State they were in by arresting (kidnapping) them.\n\nConfederates never cared about State Rights. They trampled all over them in the lead up to the war in order to perpetuate slavery. Nothing but hypocrites. Then they attacked first.",

And the design we see today isn't that flag. It's just based on it.\n\nWe only think of it as \"the\" Confederate flag today, or as a generally Confederate battle flag. Because of the adoption of today's design by neo-confederates and white supremacists in the post-bellum period. And *especially* it's use in the 2nd Clan era of the early 20th century.",

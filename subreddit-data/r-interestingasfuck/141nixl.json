Imagine how many grains of sand you could fit into the view from just your garden alone, and each of those grains holding 45,000 galaxies. Then repeat that all over the world, in every direction. \n\nStill believe in God?",

Someone on the exact opposite side of the globe will see the other half. Combine both of these observers' visible night sky and you got about 100% of it (assuming that both observers are in a very flat area). It seems very simple to me, I fail to see why you'd think we can't see close to 50% of the sky.",

Astronomers measure a galaxy\u2019s redshift to learn how far away it is, as well as when it existed in the early universe. Before Webb, there were only a few dozen galaxies observed above a redshift of 8, corresponding to when the universe was younger than 650 million years old. Now Webb\u2019s JADES program has uncovered nearly a thousand of these extremely distant galaxies!\n\n[Full size image](https://jwstfeed.com/PostView/FeedPost?ci=1685986506_JADES2)",

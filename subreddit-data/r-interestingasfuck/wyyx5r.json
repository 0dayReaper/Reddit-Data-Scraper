This is why fragmentation grenades are considered \"defensive\" grenades (i.e. must be thrown from cover); their casualty radius is significantly longer than the range they can be thrown.\n\nThere are also \"offensive\" grenades which work by blast effect and produce much less shrapnel (like the German stick grenades); they have a smaller casualty radius and so can be safely thrown from out in the open, and are also more effective in enclosed spaces since blast waves can travel around corners and reflect off surfaces, but aren't as good at inflicting widespread injuries like defensive grenades are.",

You can get lost for a good hour in the archives for  SCP-261 (the vending machine with random results and only takes Japanese yen) and also SCP-294 (the coffee machine that dispenses literally any liquid).\n\nBtw, the grenade incident was harmless, and was a separate experiment from when they tried to fool the machine. When they tried (three times) with a coin on a string, the machine's dispensed food made the subject who ate it vomit it back up. Similar to how it couldn't keep the coin used, the subjects couldn't keep the food down.\n\nGrenade incident:\n\n&gt;Money entered: 500 yen\n\n&gt;SCP-261 Powered or Unpowered: Unpowered\n\n&gt;Item description: An unlabeled object that resembles a mark 2 \"pineapple\" fragmentation hand grenade. Testing area evacuated as a precaution. D-class personnel sent in to retrieve item under surveillance, expressing concern. Object appeared to be safe. Object was moved to a blast chamber. D-class personnel ordered to remove pin, throw and evacuate, and complies reluctantly. Object explodes in the corner of the blast chamber in a \"puff of sugar\" and several high velocity fragments. Blast chamber coated in varying amounts of granulated sugar. Metal fragments observed in walls. Personnel who subsequently entered blast chamber noted perceiving a taste of sugar. No harmful effects noted.\n\n[Link to the rest of the SCP-261 experiment log](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/experiment-log-261-ad-de)",

I forgot the name of it, but basically every child above the equator (and under the age of 12 IIRC) is subject to being either kidnapped and having their family brutally killed, or given a \u201cgift\u201d by a tall, dark silhouette who speaks some sort of proto-Germanic language. The kidnapped children work in a workshop, where they make gifts out of other children\u2019s body parts, and most of the children eventually become toys themselves. The article is a short, yet horrifying read that plays on the concept of Santa Claus, creating a Krampus-type figure that is super fascinating.",

A black actor portraying Robert E Lee would be confusing to say the least. But if it's a medieval story in a setting where pretty much everyone was white or where race isn't relevant to the depicted historical event, does it really detract from the historical accuracy more than using white actors would? \n\nI could even see situations where it could actually help with an audience's understanding of things. Cultural divisions and discrimination aren't always drawn on racial lines, but using race as a loose analog could help communicate the idea of how things felt, even if it isn't \"historically accurate\".",

So no, it wouldn't take away from immersion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Or in Pearl Harbor when FDR stands up from his wheelchair to give his speech, which btw he 100% could not do?\n\nYes that was a stupid part in a movie of many stupid parts. One could argue it was an okay movie (I didn't like it) but it was not a good historical depiction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Does the casting of Tom Cruise bother you in the Jack Reacher movies despite the books describing him as \"one of the largest men she had ever seen outside of the NFL. He was extremely tall, and extremely broad.\"\n\nJack Reacher is a fictional character, fictional characters can be freely changed. It can be jarring when you change their looks a lot (example, turning Hermoine black in The Cursed Child play when everyone already had an image of her in their heads from every other piece of media) but ultimately it's a character that's made up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Or, flip that coin, wolverine should be nowhere near Hugh Jackman's height. Does that break immersion?\n\nLol comic fans where criticizing that and the fact that he was \"too handsome\" since the beginning. I thought Jackman did a good job with the character, but they definitely strayed away from a lot of the traditional features. Again, made up character though so it's more fair game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Does every Roman/German/Russian/generic European having an English accent break your immersion?\n\n Now your straying away from visuals and going towards sound which are two very different things. But to be honest, if I have the option I'll always watch sub vs. dub of non-english movies for the immersion.",

I actually lead a pretty fulfilling middle class life. I watch birds, play with my kids, and make love to my wife. The fact rich people take up real-estate in your brain is more an indication of vacant land than them actually doing anything to you, I suggest you get a hobby.\n\n&gt; I will get old and die working with almost nothing to show for it - I don't even have the prospect of home ownership in the foreseeable future even though I do skilled work full time.\n\nThe come up with a plan to do so, or move. I couldn't afford a house, 2 cars, and save money if I lived in NYC, but in cheap AF southeast MI I can.\n\n&gt;See, what people like you don't understand is that morality and ethics only exists for the working class, and the ruling class uses it to keep us stupid and weak while they exploit the entirety of humanity day after day.

It's all a big club and none of us are in it, we are expendable and exploitable and that's what has kept the club working as long as we've allowed it to.\n\nYou sound like someone who thinks their crappy boss is a rich person and applies the template to everyone who makes marginally more money than them. I've worked around actual rich people my entire professional life, multi-millionaires and two billionaires. Literally some of the nicest people I've ever met.\n\nHere's a dirty little secret. You don't build businesses by pissing off everybody working for you. Every single one I've met have a network of loyal people that have been working for them for decades and they treat those workers like gold.\n\nYou're not being mistreated by the rich, you're being mistreated by your manager who makes a couple more grand than you who probably thinks about his boss the exact same way you think about him. And you're being ill served by your own weird expectations of what you think you deserve because you base it off of what other people have. You're not a cattle led to slaughter, you're a crab in the bucket dragging down other crabs with your crap attitude.\n\n&gt;I'd argue eating the rich is self defense for the sake of human dignity and progress. The day the last rich person dies is the day we evolve from living lives of servitude and exploitation.\n\nThe funniest thing is, and always will be. You are totally and completely allowed to form a commune with as many anti-rich anti-work homies as you want. It's 100% legal. Pool resources, save money via bulk buying, all that crap.\n\nI ran the numbers a couple months ago while talking to some other eat-the-rich guy. Numbers still hold up. With 20 working adults yall can buy an up-to-code apartment complex, all the transportation you want, and put 20 kids through college.\n\nIn 10 years yall would be banking 130,000 per year. Some of you could quit or go part time. Paint flowers or some shit. Nobody's coming to stop you, because they don't care if you're successful.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3ILqjcSs5HYY2v0koHddaOdo2HcmsQdKPC\\_HT2E--s/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3ILqjcSs5HYY2v0koHddaOdo2HcmsQdKPC_HT2E--s/edit#gid=0) \n\nBut none of you ever actually do it because there seems to be a huge overlap between being extremely class conscious and being anti-social and bad at personal finances. That's just a personal observation but it's usually pretty on point.\n\nThe rich aren't holding you back. Y'all just like complaining.",

Good for you, getting ahead and not giving a fuck about anybody else as long as you got yours.\n\nBut the life you've \"built\" is propped up on the backs of many, many exploited people who you don't give a single fuck about.

If you're middle class, then it's a safe assumption that you make more money than over HALF of the US population. Where do you think your middle class wage comes from? That you fucking generated it? And you're not even that high up - the exploitation gets infinitely worse!

Cat teeth are like needles; make a hole, push bacteria in, tooth comes out, and the hole is usually cut cleanly and deeply enough it will seal before all the bacteria can be washed out. For dog bites, it will depend on the severity, but their teeth will usually leave an opening large enough for proper disinfection without antibiotics.",

My dad once got poked by a rusty nail on his forearm, and went to the hospital once he realized there was a red line tracking down his arm toward his heart.

Those that didn\u2019t pick their scabs were more likely to contract a disease as the sites collected bacteria and the wound festered under old layers.",

Of course in my opinion it's easier to just take a needle or a thumb tack, heat it up with a lighter and just lightly push it into the nail. The heat helps to burn a hole through the nail, and the blood cools it down when it hits it. Squeeze the finger tip to get as much blood as possible out, and then cover up the hole with some tissue paper and a drop of super glue. Edit if you were to do this, make sure not to hit the nail matrix, the base of the nail that looks like a white crescent. Injure that and your nail will never grow out correctly again.",

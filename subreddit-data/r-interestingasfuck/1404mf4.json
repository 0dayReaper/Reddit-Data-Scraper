            "comment": "Hongkonger here, I remember in 2019 my school's principal invited a Hong Kong journalist who was at Tiananmen Square in 1989 for a talk back when the Hong Kong protests were still going on.\n\nHe showed us photos of people shot and half ran over bodies and spoke about how he was just short enough to dodge the shots from the military as the soldiers aimed at the general height where people's heads were, so the shots went over his head instead. He told us how he hid in a public bathroom and only popped out from the roof of it to take video footage. He was later smuggled out of Beijing onto the last flight leaving the city by other Chinese protesters in the back of a van, he mentioned how people were protecting the foreign journalists so that the world could see what was happening.\n\n[I wrote about how the military units in Beijing mutinied and refused to deploy, as well as the workers forming human shields in this other comment if you're interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1404mf4/never_forget_what_happened_in_china_34_years_ago/jmupxsf)\n\nI'll never forget 13 year old me looking at the collection of photos he took, how deep it was imprinted into my mind. We were taught about the Tiananmen Square Massacre by some of our teachers since primary school, but the brutal nature of it was never visualised until that day.\n\nAfter 2019 many Hong Kong teachers resigned, and I remember studying about modern Chinese history last year, only to see a few short sentences mentioning the massacre as the \"June Forth Incident\" or \"June Forth Movement\". You could feel the self-censorship in the atmosphere of the general public. The teacher who taught me about Tiananmen in primary school had already moved to another country.\n\nOur school was called out by a CCP official and former HK chief executive later on for a separate incident when we protested on school grounds and the principal resigned for us to take responsibility and emigrated. He claimed it was his own decision and that he was planning to do so anyways, but I think deep down we all know he did it to protect us. Principal Cheng, I'm sorry we failed you.\n\nMay the dead rest in peace, I hope that China will be free one day.\n\n[The song Flower of Freedom commemorates the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, it's sung in Cantonese and is one of the most famous songs about the crackdown.

If China lays their hands on Taiwan or even Australia in an unfortunate war, I wish to help defend them from the CCP. I sometimes imagine how a democratic China would look in an alternate universe, and it saddens me how it's gone in reality.\n\nAt least 8 Hongkongers were arrested today for commemorating the Tiananmen Square Massacre under various charges, from disturbing the peace to sedition under the National Security Law. It's hard to voice out publicly in Hong Kong nowadays without risking arrest.\n\nGlory to Hong Kong! Glory to the Chinese people! Even if I don't get to see a free China in my lifetime, I do believe it will happen in the future. Afterall, the CCP is just like a dynasty in the history of China \uff0d and all dynasties will eventually fall.\n\nEdit: My comment got removed with no reason nor notification, click here to read the original comment.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/saltedballsack/comments/140klms/mom_im_famous_jokes_aside_thank_you_all_for/jmwtie0",

We as human beings are supposed to be part of a whole. A community which we can believe in and depend upon. I believe this is something we can extract great courage from. But we've been learning that many of the things that should be the responsibility of a whole is now the responsibility of the individual. Things like 'carbon footprint', not meddling when others are abused, our mental health and well being, our socioeconomic state etc. Putting more value into the former is what makes these courageous acts possible. In our current climate we lack action because as individuals most of us are well off enough, not to be bothered enough. I dream of becoming a small part of a whole. That's what I'd fight for.",

But again, most of Reddit are young people who haven't had a lot of opportunities to explore the world other than reading headlines.\n\nWhich is quite sad since we do have free access to information online, unlike the Chinese, and there are a ton of content on life in China made by foreigners and even a quick watch of some YouTuber travel Vloggers's videos would shock many Redditors, something random like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9WXigNu394) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-cbhSG_1kU).\n\nIt is precisely because of that ignorance people believe in weird myths like \"Winnie the Pooh is banned in China\". There is a Winnie the Pooh ride at [Shanghai Disney](https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/attractions/adventures-winnie-pooh/) for god's sake. All it takes is 2 seconds of Google search to debunk that, yet misinformation like that just live on and on because it's something people *want* to be true.\n\nAnd of course, people will downvote comments like mine without 2nd thought because they don't *like* it. \n\nWhen Carl Sagan warned that we will no longer being able to [distinguish between what feels good and what's true](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/632474-i-have-a-foreboding-of-an-america-in-my-children-s), he meant exactly this.",

Yes, China is an authoritarian country with heavy censorship everywhere. But it's not like you would be thrown into a prison for expressing some ideas in a casual conversation (provided that you're not important enough, i.e media influencer). If you've been to China at least once you'd know that people there are not \"suffering everyday under the brutal dictatorship\" or some shit, especially in big cities like Shanghai or Shenzhen, where the standard of living is actually quite high. My point is: if someone asked me to rate countries by the amount of freedom people there have, 10 being the complete anarchy and 0 like the worst, then I'd rate US 8, NK 0-1 and China somewhere between 5-6. Is it less free than the US? Yes, of course, no one is doubting that. But do you really think Chinese people are that dumb and don't know about it? They have the internet, and unlike as some people on reddit think, it's not completely blocked. The firewall can be easily avoided by installing some VPNs and most of the young people know how to do it. They can travel outside, see what other countries are like, unlike in north Korea. So you really think that they do not know that their country is not as free as the US or EU? The know for sure. But most of the people are consciously sacrificing part of their \"freedom\" for a more stable and prosperous environment. You cannot even imagine how China was 50 years ago, literally a backwater nation where having something to eat was considered a luxury. Most of the people do not care as long as they can live their middle class lives and see their country become richer nowadays. \nI'm not pro CCP or trying to spread propaganda. I'm just tired of all the ignorance I've seen these years. And sorry for the wall of text. \nTL;DR people should stop thinking about China using stereotypes, try to do some basic research first.",

Same for the conditions of for-profit prisons. Or how they broke up the 99% protests.\n\nThat's before even going into what happened in the middle east and Libya, the constant mass shootings, what they did to Japan and Vietnam, etc., which the average citizen might know about but not necessarily view in a negative light, or believes is or was justified in some way (because that's what they were raised to believe), or simply handwaves or has become blind to (in the case of mass shootings and generally high homicide rate).\n\nIn our education systems we are usually raised with nationalist ideals, ie. We ignore the crimes of our own nation or view them in a less negative light than the same actions of foreign countries.",

Any protests, even those about social issues are banned and labeled as anti-government (even labor day parades and pride parades got banned, so June 4th obviously got banned). Medias and trade unions are either pro-government and pro-business or got forced to disband. Also huge sum of government budget just went to a vague category called \"national security\". Transparency that we used to be proud of went to the drain, and the relatively lack of corruption probably with it next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's also a migration wave going on and a lot of professionals (eps the youth and recent university graduates) and middle class families moving away from Hong Kong (The poor can't really afford to move anywhere lol).

It's actually really bad, but not in a graphical way.\n\nBasically ALL kinds of protesting have been shutted down in the name of \"covid control\", including the annual June Forth Memorial which has been for decades. No protesting applications were permitted since then.\n\nThe Teacher Association was abolished, and members were arrested. Education materials have been revised and curriculum have been reformed by the education bureau: Liberal studies, a subject about social issues and political knowledge, has been demoted from compulsory to elective, while national education has been introduced as compulsory. \n\nNow most universities have gates and walls built to prevent outsiders from entering, turning a place for knowledge to a literal cage house. They also introduced national security in the university curriculum. Applying jobs related to the government now requires you to make a vow and pass a national security test.\n\nThe police force is expanding and gnawing huge resources from the government. They have set up a national security hotline for people to report any \"security threat\". Television now broadcast governmen-funded national security propagandas everyday. Some \"malicious\" online forums and websites were taken down. And there are still more to go.\n\nSo you see, Hong Kong is not struggling actively like before. Instead it's already defeated, and now it's in an oppressive state to wipe out any remaining oppositions. I hope you can have a better understanding of Hong Kong after this.",

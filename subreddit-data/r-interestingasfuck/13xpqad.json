On the down side, that is a lot of social assistance that the SK government needs to provide, and the whole process of modernization would be expensive.\n\nOn the plus side, NK is full of natural resources that NK cannot develop. SK on the other hand doesn't really have much natural resources, but they do have the technology and the ability to redevelop quickly. Along with the fact that SK has the worst birthrate amongst developed nations, it would tackle the decreasing population issue.\n\nHowever, I don't expect such nuanced positions in a political environment where the conservatives basically call anyone they hate a \ube68\uac31\uc774 (edit: for non-koreans it's slang for commie)\n\nAdditional thoughts: the US and China would not want a reunification. China because they don't know what it'll mean for Korea US relations, US because I don't think they would be happy with NK nuclear research and materials to comingle with SK technology, and I'm not quite sure the US would be able to sweeten the deal enough for a guarantee that nuclear technology and materials be destroyed or handed over.",

But remember that the US has systems that can see an artillery shell in flight, calculate its origin, and return fire, all before the shell lands.  So clearly they'd get some shots in.  But I don't think it would level Seoul like a lot of people say.\n\nAlso, many of these artillery positions are known fixed positions.  You can bet they would be taken out with the opening shots.",

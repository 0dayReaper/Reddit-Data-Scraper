Sea cucumbers, sea stars, sand dollars, crinoids and sea urchins are all in the phylum echinodermata which translates to spiny skin. And they're called that because they have a calcium carbonate endoskeleton which are spiny projections called ossicles and what you're seeing in this picture are the ossicles of the sea cucumber.",

But they get really big so I question if it is suitable for the balcony, would need a big pot. Btw, you have to let them grow for like 2-3yesrs before you do any harvesting. Im on my first harvest year :)",

However, instead of waiting 3 years to be established and being able to harvest them for 25 more years, you will more likely wait 2 years for them to be established and only get like 3 years of harvest before it dies due to lack of space. A well established asparagus patch can have roots 10-15 feet deep and will be significantly more resilient.",

It says it helps make up the endoskeleton, **so in general it's for rigidity, protection, and locomotion.**\n\nAlso, I am a biologist, but know nothing about sea cucumbers so all this is from a quick search. Additionally, if you check the submission it says the micrograph was taken using polarised light microscopy. This would explain why it looks so unreal",

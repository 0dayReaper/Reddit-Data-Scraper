Russia is nearly 50 times as large. \n\nAlso - trivia that I just found out - Russia and Japan have never formally ended World War II because they are still unable to agree on the ownership of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. To Japan, they would increase their territory by 1.5%; to Russia, they would increase their territory by 0.03%",

Extracting heavy metals out of waste water is apart of water treatment. They probably have gotten an unusually high build up of those particular metals, so probably include a more thorough extraction process that makes getting it out in quantifiable amounts at a justified enough cost to make it make sense.  \n \nYou're also taking about hundreds of restaurants over a long period of time.

Technically true, but an understatement.\n\nThere are 37 million people in the metropolitan area, and if the average person flushes a toilet 3 times a day we can round that to 100 million flushes.\n\nWhich means there's a bit over 1000 flushes every second on average. Of course there's less at 3am -- but even if the flushing-rate was reduced by 90% relative to the average, you'd still have 100 flushes per second.",

So from an early age you are expect to clean up after yourself. I can't imagine the rage against a classmate who's litter the rest of the class has to pick up after. Essentially, you will be making work for your classmates if you don't clean up your own shit. This mentality is extended into adulthood and I imagine that they feel extremely angry or resentful against anyone who would litter. And those who would be inclined to be cunts know everyone is watching them and literally no one is on their side if they choose to litter, due to their whole society being raised to avoid creating work for others.",

The non-Tokyo parts are [shown in green here](https://i.imgur.com/CMDhDur.jpg).  \n  \nI'm not saying that this is an apples-to-oranges thing, I'm sure that the same is true for the other cities. But I do think it's a little iffy, for any of these giant metro areas, to use the same terminology, because when people talk about \"Tokyo\" they're certainly not talking about [this](https://i.imgur.com/t0m1NCl.jpg), which is part of the Greater Tokyo Area with the 37 million population.",

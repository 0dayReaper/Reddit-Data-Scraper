Like, on one hand it\u2019s just a toilet sitting out in the basement and that\u2019s very weird. (My grandparents also had a shower stall installed - they had 10 kids and only one bathroom) On the other hand I never one felt weird peeing down there. There was an accepted set of rules regarding using that toilet to prevent walking in on someone.",

Not much of a punishment when you think about it. They even have Slumbo the Adventurous Ghost up there. He is like our own cute Casper that came with the house!\"\n\n**\"That's the punishment. Trust me, Sarah, our kids aren't going to even get a chance on the PlayStation. The kids' k/d ratio in MW2 is ass anyway. And don't say the C word, that is very offensive to ghosts. That is their word. The living can't say it, especially with the hard r.\"**\n\n\"I think the C word is something else, honey.\"\n\n**\"Yeah, well, you think that cause you're a cunt.\"**\n\n\"Richard! That doesn't explain how being sent to the attic house to play on their PlayStation and hang out with Slumbo the Adventurous Ghost is a punishment! Why wouldn't they be having fun with a magically whimsical ghost in an adorable little rotting house? Even if their k/d is ass.\"\n\n**\"He isn't an adventure ghost. You heard that wrong, when the realtor with blackened eyes that spoke only in incoherent tongues tricked us into buying this former church with a dilapidated house in the attic. It is Slumbo the A*****lcoholic Ghost.*** **And he is an angry drunk that is bound to the attic house. He is not whimsical in the least. He doesn't even float like a normal ghost. Just mindlessly stumbles into shit. We have to leave a handle of whiskey by the stairs every 12 hours, or we will all be cursed.\"**\n\n\"Every 12 hours! I think he may have a problem!\"\n\n**\"Babe, his ghoulish title is literally 'The Alcoholic Ghost.'\"**\n\n\"Ok, that is well-disciplined parenting. That'll teach the kids not to put their shitty drawings on the fridge. I mean, really, that was the worst drawing of a 'doggie' I've ever seen in my life. And writing 'happy family' above their drawing of us is just a blatant lie.. Oh yeah!  I can hear our kids screaming! Lots of slurred spooky yelling too. That crashing is rather violent, sounds like that adven- I mean, alcoholic ghost is really giving them the business!\"\n\n**\"Classic Slumbo.\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* **Everything I write is from me. Check out my profile/profile's top comments for other examples.** I've been writing in this style and others for fun before chatgpt existed. This is not chatgpt, it doesn't even read like one. I can't imagine being a person that makes such low-stakes accusations with zero evidence and being completely wrong. Just straight up lying. Didn't think I would have to add a footnote, but here we are. What an epic Redditor moment! Let us all go grab our chalices of Mountain Dew Code Red to celebrate.\n\nTo those that enjoyed the fun short Slumbo Story I wrote, I appreciate it. You guys are rad.",

You'll finish \\[the book\\] and that will be that, until a moment will come, maybe in a month, maybe a year, maybe even several years. You'll be sick or feeling troubled or deeply in love or quietly uncertain or even content for the first time in your life. It won't matter. Out of the blue, beyond any cause you can trace, you'll suddenly realize things are not how you perceived them to be at all. For some reason, you will no longer be the person you believed you once were. You'll detect slow and subtle shifts going on all around you, more importantly shifts in you. Worse, you'll realize it's always been shifting, like a shimmer of sorts, a vast shimmer, only dark like a room. But you won't understand why or how. You'll have forgotten what granted you this awareness in the first place  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You might try then, as I did, to find a sky so full of stars it will blind you again. Only no sky can blind you now. Even with all that iridescent magic up there, your eye will no longer linger on the light, it will no longer trace constellations. You'll care only about the darkness and you'll watch it for hours, for days, maybe even for years, trying in vain to believe you're some kind of indispensable, universe-appointed sentinel, as if just by looking you could actually keep it all at bay. It will get so bad you'll be afraid to look away, you'll be afraid to sleep.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Then no matter where you are, in a crowded restaurant or on some desolate street or even in the comforts of your own home, you'll watch yourself dismantle every assurance you ever lived by. You'll stand aside as a great complexity intrudes, tearing apart, piece by piece, all of your carefully conceived denials, whether deliberate or unconscious. And then for better or worse you'll turn, unable to resist, though try to resist you still will, fighting with everything you've got not to face the thing you most dread, what is now, what will be, what has always come before, the creature you truly are, the creature we all are, buried in the nameless black of a name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And then the nightmares will begin.\u201d\n\nMark Z. Danielewski, House of Leaves",

Apparently it used to be a Carl's Market and the owners of lived in the attic house. Then they sold it and it was turned into a church and the new owners didn't borrow to demo (hence the insulation over the attic house's floors). Then the church got turned into a house and now OP lives there.",

Very likely just judging by the pictures this was a old house with a little second story that was just a couple rooms and a bath. \n\n  I\u2019m guessing that was a window on the left that was painted over? Idk I\u2019m just spitballing but my educated guess is they decided it was useless at some point and instead of removing it just built around it during a remodel of the roof.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve squirreled my way into attics before that had an entire roof inside that was built over multiple times. Shingles and everything. Cheaper to build a new roof over it than remove everything.\n\nEdit 2: OP confirmed it in another comment I saw after posting this. Pretty trippy and definitely creepy, even with the totally reasonable explanation. If I had to crawl up in an attic and saw this I\u2019d immediately think what the absolute fuck.",

The 200 year old roof and the base of the steeple were still there in the attic.\n\nThey're spending so much on the reconstruction so they save some money by not demolishing the parts that aren't in the way of the new roof since they're just going to be in the attic where nobody goes anyway.\n\nI'm not sure if you could get away with this with modern building codes, but construction was the wild west until only a few decades ago in the US.",

Might I suggest tearing out what can't be saved and rebuilding it to look just like a house from the 1920s, complete with a bunch of antiques to fit the look?  That would make one hell of a guest bedroom, don't mention a word about it to your guests until you say \"well, here's your room\".",

Single sided so that birds flying into the tree or chipmunks or other non-target species animals don\u2019t get attached to the tape.\n\nI had an old garden hose, so I wrapped that around the tree, cut it and clamped it.  I put some cotton batting in between the tree and the bark so that the bugs couldn\u2019t crawl underneath the hose. Then I just stuck the tape around the garden hose, leaving an exposed edge.",

Bugs from the NA ecosystem tend to ignore them because they haven't co-evolved to deal with their defenses, which results in aesthetic niceties like mostly intact foliage. Plus, a lot of the ornamentals are just fashionable-- I think tree of heaven is native to China? And a parent species to that horrible-smelling landscaping pear tree.\n\nBugs, bacteria, and fungal diseases tend to hitch a ride on imported plants, like spiders and bananas, and it's literally just a matter of numbers until a capital P Problem species gets released onto an ecosystem that's never had to defend against its avenue of attack before. The spotted lantern fly is but one of many. The process is analogous to how pandemics happen, though, you are correct about that part.",

It's clearly a statement implying the presence of China in the news cycle. That's not a \"Fox News\" thing, that's a US media thing. \n\nHere are some examples of China being in the news\n\n- China's rising aggression towards Taiwan\n- China's flexing of power forcing Hong Kong to expunge its expedition laws resulting in the \"Free Hong Kong movement.\n- Weather balloons flying over sensitive American targets of Chinese origin.\n- The rapid spread of Two Chinese invasive species that coincidentally thrive on each other that can easily destroy plant life and building infrastructure\n- Random seeds mailed to people in America, from China. \n\nIn reality, your comment is simply one that doesn't encourage discourse unless you have a brain rotted person like me to break it down for you. It's literally the Republican tactic of \"just say no to any regulation that mentions the second amendment\" with a nice Lib coat of paint. \n\nLike, currently you're having a discussion with an Asian socialist that that likes how China flexes on big corporations and I'm telling you that this comment is not where you should be virtue signaling, this is just a result of watching news in general. China dominates the news cycle because they're arguably the most important economic power in the world.",

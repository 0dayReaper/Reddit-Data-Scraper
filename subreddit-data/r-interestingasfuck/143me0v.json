But this guy thinks the bus to be higher than him. This is why he is joining his hands and touching the base. Touching the feet is an Indian tradition, it is a way to ask for blessings by bowing to the lowest, the feet, out of respect. To him, the bus has been a deity that fed his family, educated his kids and secures his retirement.",

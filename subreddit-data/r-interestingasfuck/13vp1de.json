I believe it used to be much deeper back in the day though.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: hijacking my own comment to make some clarifications and answer to common questions:\n\n- This pool is located in an older neighborhood in in Louisville, KY, USA. \n\n- This quarry was converted to a pool 99 years ago but a filtration system was not added until decades later. The filtration system circulates 3.5 million gallons of water every 6 hours. \n\n- This is a private club established by the local neighborhood residents in 1924. The founding households pass down \u201ccertificate memberships\u201d with the property deeds. This group of about 180 people or 120 households are automatic members (if they choose to pay dues) and they are each allowed to sponsor up to 1 household per year for new membership. Non-certificate members cannot sponsor new members.\n\n- No HOA fees. Club is funded my dues, which are very reasonable in my opinion given the amount of upkeep required. Annual dues run around $500 USD per person or $1500 per family. This includes year round gym access about 3.5 months of access to the \u201clake pool\u201d and an additional 4.5 months to a smaller side lap pool, which is covered by a heated bubble in the off season.\n\n- The competition section of the pool is 10 lanes and 50 meters. \n\n- This pool hosts the longest running swim meet in the USA (soon to be 95 years) and also hosts a very successful club team, which has produced 11 olympians to date.\n\n- Sorry for my old man finger in one of the photos. Didn\u2019t realize it when selecting the thumbnails for the post.",

It was a few feet deep for about 10-15 yards and then a straight drop to ~70. \n\nThey used to allow you to bring beer in kegs or cans (no glass!) and we'd do beer relay races out to the floating platforms and back. I'm not sure if it's open anymore based on its web/facebook presence being lacking, but 20+ years ago it was a fucking blast, even if it was ~70 feet deep.\n\nE: I found some information that says the max depth is 70 feet at the Portage Quarry, not 100+. Forgive me, I was drunk when I was there and it was a long time ago.",

Trout require cool water because as the temperature rises the amount of dissolved oxygen decreases. If you catch one and fight it, it can run itself to exhaustion and never recover. Bad situation if it's only catch and release or you aren't keeping them.\n\nLuckily, there are sections of rivers with cold water year around, even at 90+ degree ambient temperature. The water is from the very bottom of a very deep reservoir and it gets released from the bottom of the dam.\n\nImagine it is 95 degrees in the middle of summer and the hip deep water is 45 degrees. I wear regular, non-insulated waders, so I don't get wet, but I still feel the cold. The top half of your body is sweating like crazy, but your bottom half is practically numb. It's such an odd feeling. \n\nYou have to be very careful to move your legs and shift your weight on occasion. Otherwise, you don't realize that your legs are numb. You go to make a step and your legs won't work properly and you fall over. Don't forget, the strong current can also be a factor that keeps you from standing back up.",

I was a swimmer and diver, so I could free-dive about 30-40 feet (could, no way in my old age I could do that now). I remember free-diving down pretty deep with goggles on and out of the depths I could start to see the top of an old crane with a bunch of mangled wires going everywhere further into the depths. \n\nIt honestly really freaked me out, just the idea that I could get tangled up in whatever old equipment was still down there was enough for me to not try it again. They fenced off the quarry a few years later because people kept drowning in it. I still think about it time to time, just this dark water then the top of that crane coming into view of my flashlight. I'll stick to diving tropical places.",

People experiencing this condition are typically afraid of things like buoys, submarines, sunken ships, and many other objects that sink into the ocean. Submechanophobia is among the many conditions classified under specific phobias, fears that are irrational, overwhelming, and accompanied by symptoms of severe anxiety that can affect daily functioning when untreated.!&lt;",

There was a few quarries in Milford NH that we would go to. There was one off Comstock Rd that had the tallest cliff that I've ever seen.  Used to go to the Westford quarry too where they filmed Grownups at. Been to the one in Rockport that has the giant log in the middle. Kind of just grew out of them though.",

No HOA dues: the \"certificates\" were part of the agreement with local homeowners when the pool was built and are passed down with the deed to the house. It applies to something like 120 houses. Those home owners still have to pay membership fees, but are the only ones who automatically can join. Everyone else (i.e. me and others just unlucky enough to live out of the certificate area) has to be \"sponsored\" by a certificate household and they can only sponsor one other household a year, but once your family is in, you're in for good.",

This can be mitigates a good bit by showering before getting in the pool. \n\nBut I would never go so far as to say \"If you smell chlorine don't go in the water\", that's a bit sensationalist.",

I would never want to stick my head under there.\n\nSo yeah works good for paddle boats but definitely not swimming. I believe there\u2019s a couple of cars at the bottom of the quarry. But it is very deep, I can\u2019t remember exactly now but it\u2019s like 50+ feet?",

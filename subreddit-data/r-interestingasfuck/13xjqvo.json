Having a ref control the game doesn't add an extra element to the competition. It adds corruption, and that's been proven countless times.",

This applies to the HUMAN referees too.\n\nI don't know much about Basketball, but in Football many players tend to trick referees in order to get penalties, break opponents build up towards attack, free kicks, time wasting and what not. Based on the referee's personality, he/she can deliver judgements leniently or harshly.\n\nWith AI, these things will disappear. It will take the life out of the game. Yes some technological advances are needed in sports. For example, Cricket uses a huge amount of technology, but still there is the human error part still present. Football too uses VAR, but only for major decisions.\n\nAlso what's a sport without tricking your opponent to commit an error to gain advantage?",

It's always striking to me that diehard soccer fans love going on about how technical and \"beautiful\" their sport is when one of the sports' most famous moments in the hand of god involved a guy cheating and bragging about it. This is on top of Maradona's amazing cross field goal that only happened because the English were too honorable to play dirty with him like they \"should\" have. \n\nThink sports will ultimately be better when there's consistency with the rules, but not sure if they will be as popular when you lose the significant drama element.",

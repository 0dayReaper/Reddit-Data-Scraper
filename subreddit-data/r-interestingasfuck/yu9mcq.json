This is why mental issues mess with the perception of emotions and understanding perspective.\n\nFor example: two babies are fed the same snack at the same time every time. If you suddenly give one of the babies both servings, they will both be able to identify there is something wrong. The baby who was given both servings will be able to recognize and point out that the unfed baby is upset and why, but survival instincts are selfish enough for the baby to have to be _taught_ to give the unfed babg the extra serving they were given.\n\nBasically you're a baby if you can identify \"that must be a difficult situation\" and make no effort to offer some very easy-to-give help.",

How were you treated? Do exactly what you wish the other person would treat you in that situation.\n\nDoing something courteous for someone every day puts them in a good mood, they\u2019re grateful. It increases the chance they will treat other people better that day. And so on and so forth the \u201cpass it on\u201d mentality takes hold.\n\nYou truly never know, giving someone a smile on the street or letting the grocery bagger know you\u2019re not in a rush and to take their time while being patient and polite might save a life. \n\nPeople deal with shit everyday, aim to not be the person who pushes them over the edge but the person who puts a smile on their face.(no not like the joker)",

It is because walking and biking are often the most fasted AND convenient ways of getting places, which result in people getting a lot of passive exercise.  \n\nWe're wasting our lives sitting in traffic, and we're all forced to sit through it because the ONLY way of getting anywhere is by car, here in America.  It doesn't matter how rich or poor you are, for the most part you're going by car and therefore stuck in traffic ALL THE TIME.  \n\nIt doesn't matter how many lanes you make, traffic never gets better.  Plus roads are under construction non stop, at least if you live in an area with money.  Otherwise it's just pothole city, part of which is due to how car centric cities cause insolvency because it costs more to maintain road infrastructure vs public transportation.",

It's awful trying to walk when it's crowded and people are randomly biking in the walking areas, though. Depending on where you are, they're may be no place to go.

Also, groups of people are just chillin' in the middle of the road while their dogs run around. Then you have fours across the road driving 15 mph. Also the road alternates between asphalt and wood which is slippery as hell. And there are three roots growing into the roads making it really bumpy too. Oh and there are stop signs every 30 feet. Oh and the road doesn't take you to where you need to go directly so uh...good luck?\n\nDrivers often view the roads as strictly for cars. It makes sense. Most people don't ride bikes, but drivers are often *very* cavalier about this. They will argue what amounts to \"me or someone else will kill you. Our cars are very dangerous!\" But they don't ever think, \"our cars are very dangerous, so we should exercise extreme caution to keep other road users safe\".\n\nLike, roads literally exist because of bikes. \n\nI wish there was less animosity between everyone.

I'm always surprised at how many people have a pretty dangerous view that they'd be calm/rational in emergencies, when the reality is that even people with training can go into shock or panic. \n\nFrom personal experience as well - as someone who is generally reliably calm in emergencies, that can change in an instant and in weird ways. One time at a crash site I was getting folks calmed down and giving instructions, but the stress hit in strange ways I hadn't dealt with before. Was normal on the phone, but took me 15 tries to type out a short text message (literally like one of those nightmares where the keys don't work). Critical thinking went out the window for a bit and I did some weird wandering about before getting collected again. My husband was panicked and couldn't really speak. Another guy was fine and helping, very calm, but then I realized he wasn't actually thinking clearly and couldn't answer my questions. Days later I'd randomly cry, out of nowhere. \n\nBe kind to yourself, sounds like you did your best and really tried! And there are some things you can do to help yourself in emergency situations in the future, which should help you feel better. A comprehensive CPR/first aid course with emphasis on the latter covers a lot of valuable info. Practice sitting down and taking deep breaths in a pattern, as doing that to get yourself calm is so helpful when you need it. I'm so sorry that happened to you!",

But it sucks when every third car has no sense.  I personally like at least 2 or 3 feet of clearance, and not to pass more than 15mph faster than me. Other recommendations I've heard are 5-6+ feet of clearance.  That's probably a good idea, but I regularly have people buzz me less than 2 ft.",

Cyclists call this a \"punishment pass\". \n\nI usually ride in a group on the road for safety. I've been road riding since the 80s and know how to stay out of the way of drivers and ride safely. My entire group is a bunch of experienced racers who know what we're doing. We ride very early in the morning (5 am start) on low traffic routes... and yet a small minority of drivers will STILL antagonize us just because we're there. \n\nI do enjoy when the person who punishment passed gets stopped at a red light and we start to catch up to them. They always try to scramble to turn right, floor it to get away or whatever so we don't catch them. Fucking cowards. Everyone's a tough guy in a car. \n\nYears ago, a convenient police officer once caught a particularly irritating asshole doing this repeatedly to us (douche would pass, slow down and then pass again, we saw him on several rides) and pulled the guy over. It was beautiful. Never saw him again.",

If there are cars coming the other way, there's just not enough space (although some cut it close, but that's another issue). But even when there's a 2 lanes of space to pass, there's still many idiots who almost hit me with their side mirrors because turning their steering wheel even a few degrees more is too much effort to not almost mow down a cyclist...",

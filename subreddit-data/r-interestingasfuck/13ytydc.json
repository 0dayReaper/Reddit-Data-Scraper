I look out of the window to see something that looks exactly like this, maybe 1-2 meters in diameter? It was traveling just behind the wing at the same speed as the plane. I stared at it for a time trying to figure out what it was. The person next to me was asleep or I may have asked them to look. I looked away for a minute or so, and when I looked back, gone. Never seen anything like it until this.",

Both of them described the object as a ball like thing that looked like a miniature moon in the twilight while they were driving on an Eastern European countryside road.\n\nAlso, the [ball lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_lightning) folklore came into my mind, watching this footage. It is very strange reading medieval accounts describing a ball, roughly the size of this object doing things around them. Eerie.\n\nedit: [check out this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/135ujiq/amazing_footage_of_cylindrical_ufo_filmed_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from Hungary about an UFO encounter, the video hasn't been debunked as a hoax, so this is the closest I think we'll get to see these phenomena",

(I was flying LAX-PDX) Us, a Southwest crew and an American crew were all talking about it on frequency. ATC saw nothing but it was teasing all 3 of us for an hour or so until it shot straight up at lightning fast speed. \n\nThe other time when I was teaching I was off the coast of Malibu and I asked \u201cSoCal we have traffic at 12o clock, do you want us to descend or climb?\u201d\n\nSoCal \u201cyou\u2019re the only one flying off the coast right now, theres no one else out there can you describe the object?\u201d\n\n\u201cLooks like a giant orb sir, maybe 3 miles out\u201d \n\nI personally thought it was a helicopter- a very famous billionaire in the area had the transponder to their helicopter removed so they don\u2019t necessarily show up on ATC\u2019s screen\u2026 anyway \n\nMy student is a little weirded out and he thinks it\u2019s a test of some kind.\n\nATC gives us permission to descent or climb so We descend, the orb descended, we climbed the orb climbed. Then it looked like it hyper jumped to get closer to us then back. My student and I were stunned- I\u2019m telling ATC this and then it just rocket ships straight up- so fast you can\u2019t see it after a second or 2. \n\nMy student who was on his third flight lesson was so spooked he stopped flying for a few weeks.\n\nI was thrilled when I got to see it again in the airlines. The fact that 2 other crews were spooked/fascinated made my captain and I feel somewhat sane \ud83d\ude05 the fact that it was hopping between the 3 of us was incredible.",

Even nearly 20 years later it\u2019s still the most bizarre and fascinating thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nThe craft was a few thousand feet off the ground, shiny and metal, and 100% perfectly symmetrical ellispoid shape - it almost looked like it was made of liquid mercury or something.  It had this haze or a shimmer of some sort surrounding the metal which seemed to be distorted the air a few feet around it.  The strangest thing was how perfect it was in both shape and path.  It just cruised right on through the valley in a line so straight it that I found it notably odd.  It didn\u2019t make any noise at all, 100% silent.\n\nWe watched it for about 15 seconds just flying on through before it vanished behind the mountain.  My friend and I turned to each other with a look of \u201cwhat the Hell was that??\u201d and ran to catch up with our other friends.  We thought everyone else was about 10 mins ahead of us, but when we found them they said they had been searching for us for hours!\n\nI\u2019m not saying it was necessarily aliens, but it was such a odd thing I have a hard time believing it was man-made.",

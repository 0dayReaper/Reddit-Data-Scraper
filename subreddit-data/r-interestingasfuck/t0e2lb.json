Ones with speaker phones and ones who organically become \u201cleaders\u201d of those protests. normally protests fizzle as not everyone has the ability to encourage/influence a crowd. \n\nThere are many other crowd control techniques I have seen, like police infiltrating the protest, slowly assuming the \u201cleaders\u201d role, then convincing people to go home and \u201crest\u201d to start again tomorrow. Then they block the entire site. \n\nNext day when people people show up, they won\u2019t have access to main roads/spaces and will be cornered in a non-strategic location where they can scream and shout all day long with no impact on day to day life. \n\nStay strong.",

Military police in full gear goes through the crowd in lines, grabs random people, beats them and drags them into the bus. After that you are either lucky and you just get detained without right for water, food or toilet for a day and fined, or you are fucked and they beat you up and torture. I saw a young kid, teenager, got grabbed and dragged. He was not a leader of anything, he was wearing his school backpack. It's scary as fuck. \nRight at this moment one of my friends is detained. He says the police is in full force, they just grab everyone, so that the crowd can't even start.",

Let alone wishing that someone else will \"demand\" something. \n\nYou need ideas, organise them and put them into action. \n\nFirst of figure out what it is exactly you are demanding and how you aim to achieve it.\n\nEdit: The problem with \"demanding\" is that you are inherently asking. It is a naive concept and childish behaviour. If you demand something, people just tell you: *NO!*\n\nWhat you need to do is... **to do**. Do what you think needs to be done. Make it happen.

They had a multitude of ways to ensure the mistakenly deceased would be able to alert his plight.  Included were bells and tubes for air and the like, but one was a flag.  Prior to the casket, a doctor would take a small flag and insert it into the person's chest at the heart, under the assumption that the beating heart you move the flag alerting the staff.   But only ended up ensuring that the deceased remained deceased because impaling a person's heart is a sure fire way to a. Remain dead or b. Become dead.  \n\nThat's been my weird fact for the day.\n\n[link with a better explanation ](https://historycollection.com/buried-alive-common-victorian-era-doctors-used-10-methods-prevent/6/)",

I\u2019m not sure what your background is, but my father is a former clinical tech and regularly sits in the OR during brain surgeries to teach doctors how to use diagnostic and surgical equipment. He\u2019s explained the the process to me, both pre-operative mapping (which still requires holes in your skull and embedded electrodes to apply stimuli) and intraoperative mapping done during the main surgery. Now, I don\u2019t know if little flags placed on the brain is a normal method of documenting the map, he\u2019s never volunteered it nor have I asked. But there\u2019s is definitely an exploratory mapping phase in lots of brain surgeries where they wake you up after opening the skull and have you perform tasks and provide sensation feedback to identify key areas to protect and sometimes to help locate target areas for the surgery. Famously a few years ago a musician named Dagmar Turner played her violin throughout her surgery so the doctors could ensure they weren\u2019t compromising her ability to play music. As the doctors did their mapping they looked for any change in her ability to play and avoided affecting regions that appeared to compromise her ability to play as they removed a tumor.",

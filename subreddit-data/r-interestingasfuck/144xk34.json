Snails are hermaphrodites and fertilize their own eggs, meaning a person that has only ever had one snail as a pet can still have baby snails show up. It's important for snail owners to keep an eye on their pets enclosure to ensure they remove eggs if they do not intend to raise or sell babies.",

It's important for snail owners to keep an eye on their pets enclosure to ensure they remove eggs if they do not intend to raise or sell babies.",

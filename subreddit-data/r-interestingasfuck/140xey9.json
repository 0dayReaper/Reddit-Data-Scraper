Did you buy some POS off brand thing from Turkey?\n\n2. I Doubt .38spl was going 1000fps out of a little derringer. That's most likely why the hollow point didn't expand. Never believe the FPS ratings that ammo manufactures advertise. They are always optimistic and measured with firearms that don't represent whats actually used. Like 1000fps might be possible out of a 5\" barrel of an old police revolver. But not out of a 2\" snub nose that are much more commonly carried these days.",

As Mark McCaughrean, senior advisor science and exploration at the ESA, writes in an email to Smithsonian.com: \u201cThings are not quite as they seem.\u201d\n\n&gt;\tMost of the flecks in the foreground of the GIF are actually particles floating far away from Comet 67P\u2014and not on the surface of the icy world. Rosetta captured the images while circling some 13 kilometers (8 miles) away. At this distance, the craft\u2019s OSIRIS camera doesn\u2019t have the sensitivity and resolution to pick up dust particles flying around directly above the comet\u2019s surface, says McCaughrean.\n\n&gt;\tThis foreground \u201csnow\u201d is likely part of the hazy envelope of dust, known as the coma, that commonly forms around the comet\u2019s central icy body or nucleus. As comets pass close to the sun, the emanating warmth causes some of the ice to turn to gas, which generates a poof of dust around the icy nucleus.\n\n[Source](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/video-comet-snowstorm-likely-shows-dust-particles-180968889/)",

The first flight, by Orville at 10:35 am, of 120 feet (37 m) in 12 seconds, at a speed of only 6.8 miles per hour (10.9 km/h) over the ground, was recorded in a famous photograph. The next two flights covered approximately 175 and 200 feet (53 and 61 m), by Wilbur and Orville respectively. Their altitude was about 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground.\n\nMeaning that there have been people that were born before the first powered flight and died after this mission was planned and launched. Mindblowing in my opinion.",

(As the delay from the speed of light would make it impossible) so the entire system has to be completely automated, landing itself on an uneven surface, where the nearly nonexistant gravity means the slightest mistake would send you hurtling back off into space. Now imagine designing a machine to do this, that has to remain in perfect working condition for over ten years while being exposed to a hard vacuum, in the bitter cold of outer space while being bombarded by heavy radiation the whole time.\n\nThere are so many challenges they had to overcome that it's frankly astonishing how well it worked!",

The distance just distorts their wavelength and makes them take longer to get to you. But if you know the distance to the source you can account for the wavelength shift.

That means that from leaving the ground, to stopping at the top of the jump (so halfway through) was half a second. Using \u2206v=at and knowing a is basically 10m/s^2 and t is half a second we know that the fastest a human ever left the ground by jumping was about 5 m/s. \n\nOK, so that means you need to be on an asteroid which has an [escape velocity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity) of 5 m/s.  If you use the formulas in that link, and assume a density of 3,000 kg/m^3 for rock (which is about the average) then you get an asteroid with a radius of 3800 m. \n\nSo, if an asteroid was 3.8km across and you jumped as hard as you could, you would (eventually) fall back down to it (it would just take a while). If it were smaller, and you jumped as hard as Michael Jordan you'd fly away from it forever.",

The thing is, the relative force of gravity exerted by objects, even really large ones, is pretty much completely negligible here on earth due to the large force of gravity pulling us directly down. When looked at, the resultant force of gravity that acts on us here is almost always directly down because of the sheer mass of the planet relative to even massive structures. Standing next to a huge skyscraper the size of this comet wouldn't feel any different from standing anywhere else on earth. In space,  there aren't any nearby objects (i.e. a planet) that exert their own forces and thereby mess with the resultant force acting on you, so you can clearly experience the gravitational pull of much smaller objects than you might expect. So basically, size isn't the be all end all (everything with mass has some gravity), you just won't notice the gravity of smaller objects unless you're pretty much alone in space with them.",

I think those big rocks on the surface would be spun off if it was rotating *too* fast.  \nI think all the ice n junk has already been ripped away but accumulated over time, and it's just following the grav well along like when you throw a loose dirty snowball..  \n  \n  \nedit: I think I see a whitewalker just over that ridge.",

More money certainly makes life easier, but you don't actually have to be rich to live here. It's a different way of life than most people are used to, and definitely not for everyone, but the city has a lot to offer even when living on a very tight budget.\n\nAnd I tried living in Jersey City and commuting. It suuuucked. Commutes get long, you have to live walking distance from a bus or train stop that gets service all night or else you'll have to schedule all evening plans around catching the last train/getting a ride home from the station (or have a big uber budget), and it is nearly impossible to get anyone to come visit your place.\n\nAnd it really isn't that much cheaper.",

A bodega sandwich or halal truck shawarma can fill you up for $5 to $10. And the cost of a slice of cheese pizza is generally around the same as the cost of subway fare - so about $2.75 now.\n\nGrocery costs vary vastly. When looking for an apartment checking the easily accessible grocery stores is important, since you'll be carrying everything home in bags. Generally speaking, the richer the neighborhood the pricier the grocery stores are. Less affluent areas often have more affordable food, but watch out for food deserts - low rent neighborhoods with no easily accessible grocery stores.\n\nIt also helps to get to know a bunch of grocery stores, if you have the time to travel to a couple different places for the best prices. Be prepared to walk a fair amount, and get a [**folding wheely cart**](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/2eAAAOSwh3ljICWo/s-l400.jpg) for when you need to carry more than just enough stuff for tonight's dinner.\n\nE.g., Hong Kong Supermarket off Bowery has fantastic cheap produce. And on weekends I'll walk a mile to go to the nearest Food Bazaar, a local chain that is much cheaper for most things than my corner grocery store. Though I also recently found another little neighborhood grocery store that has a butcher counter with quartered chicken thighs for $0.39/lb when they're on sale. Which is so crazy cheap I'm almost afraid there's something wrong with it, but this place looks really good. And there's another neighborhood place that has the cheapest eggs.\n\nWhen I was super broke, like part time minimum wage struggling to pay $500/month rent on a horrible tiny room in a horrible apartment I shared with six people level broke, I ate a lot of rice and beans.\n\nHell, I still cook a lot. Grubhub gets *really* expensive very quickly.\n\nAlso I think eating affordability may be easier here than in Jersey City, at least if you don't have a car. A lot more grocery stores to choose from, without having to carry a bunch of bags home on the PATH.",

Its hard and abrasive. Instead of rustling leaves we get microplastics, instead of fresh air we get car exhaust, instead of birds chirping we get construction and engines hammering away. \n\nOn every layer we have found a way to pollute our bodies and mind with cities like these. \n\nTaking a step back you see hundreds of thousands of people eating and shitting, and all the waste and pollution we create. \n\nAnd 99% of us are slaving away so that a couple of rich people can experience the best slavery has to offer. To them, we are just a waste basket filling up with trash. \n\nWhen you're in the middle of it, its sometimes hard to truly see and understand.. grasp the extent of it.. kinda like its difficult to grasp just how much money 150 billion actually is.. pictures like these makes it comprehensible.

If you're drinking at home you're completely stuck there. Oh, you started dinner, opened a bottle of wine while you cooked, and realized you forgot to buy a crucial ingredient? Well, too bad. Cracked a few beers to unwind after work and your friend calls up and wants to meet up at the bar? Not happening.",

Most folks in my neighborhood have lived there their whole life and everybody knows everybody. Like you do you out in the middle of nowhere, which is also a perfectly fine way to live. But people gotta stop talking like Living in a big city is somehow robbing you of the joys of a simple life. My life is simple man. I love it it here and I think more people would if they stopped being a tourist and just experience the actual city. \n\nNew York is literally just a bunch of small neighborhoods/cities. \n\n\nAlso why bring up target or qudoba? People here go to delis owned by some dude in the neighborhood, as well as locally owned restaurants and the like.

And honestly, there are 3 fucking things that I wish I had access to soooo much.\n\n1. Public transportation. There's buses here, but the stops are really far apart and limited. And that's basically it for public transport. There's technically trains, but it literally just goes from one city to a different one like an hour away. So you basically NEED a car to get anywhere here.\n\n2. FOOD OPTIONS. There is like, nothing near me. I found a single good Italian restaurant, that's like $30 a plate minimum :\\ There's only ever *good* pizza, there's no great pizza. Every burger place around here sucks or is ridiculously expensive. In n Out is good, but the wait isn't worth, and I hate eating at the actual place. And In n Out loses a lot of quality and ends up being pretty meh when you don't eat it right away. And I have like 5 restaurant options around me where I live that are relatively close. If I want anything else I gotta travel for it. And they only deliver with doordash or random apps like that and it ends up costing like double what you'd pay in the actual store.\n\n3. Any other goddamn stores. I've recently been getting into comic books, and wanted to go to an actual store to get some personal recommendations and also find a place where I could buy new comic books from when they release, the closest comic book store to me is like an hour away by car on a freeway... I've also been into astronomy for a few years and searched for a store that had telescopes and lens and stuff a while ago. Literally nothing for like 2 hours around me besides random stores that have like 3 telescopes and a couple lenses. Being able to find whatever random store I want would be awesome.\n\nI do want to move to a high population area eventually. Something like New York or Chicago or something. (I technically live somewhat near LA and go there often for random doctor visits, but that place is pretty shit, ngl)",

We don't have lawns to water or fertilize, and our aparyments require less heat both because they are smaller than suburban/rural homes and because they are insulated by their neighbors. Meanwhile stand alone houses bleed all their excess heat into the open air.\n\nIf you want ecologically sustainable communities, consolidate.

Many parts of Mexico use these systems of water storage.  Not rain water collection, but almost like the tank on the back of a standard toilet.  Parts of Mexico I\u2019ve been in have bad water pressure and even inconsistent access to running water, I assume due to poor infrastructure.  This allows the water to slowly collect in the reservoir and lessen the strain and demand on existing infrastructure for water supply.  The structure is for esthetics to conceal the tanks.",

I remember flying up to the highway that connects Mexico City with the neighboring state of Puebla, and on my way back this housing complex that seemed to go on forever caught my attention. I decided to circle around to observe from up close what I later found out was the recently built San Buenaventura complex, which is located in Ixtapaluca, on the eastern outskirts of Mexico City.\n\nThe exceptional afternoon sun reflecting those thousands of recently painted small homes just looked so beautiful, and the lower I flew the better the angle, so I just got out my camera, opened the sliding window on my Bell helicopter, and snapped a couple of shots. \u2014Oscar Ruiz",

            "comment": "Some context on these types of neighborhoods from an actual Mexican.\n\n|History|\nThis style of development began a few decades ago and has been largely run by the government. It's meant to combat informal developments, slums, and shanty towns. They're largely targeted at M\u00e9xico's urban poor. They're built as cheaply as possible, which has led to quality issues and other complications, but they have been partially effective at providing cheap and stable housing to a significant portion of the population.\n\n|Construction|\nThey'll often be built on cheap, undeveloped land at the edge of the city. I've seen them in towns as small as 90k population, and even there, they were pretty large, extending for at least a mile both ways. The ones in the picture are a quite nice since often than not, they're built to the bare minimum- only one story and a room or two is typical but theres always a driveway haha (even some rich homes dont have driveways and are forced to use street parking). The typical square footage is usually equal to or less than an American trailer home - a comparable housing situation.\n\n|Price|\nIve heard of them selling for as little as 10k and the ones in the picture would go somewhere between 25-60k i believe. So for a small 10k usd loan, far less than most cars, you can have a nice little houses in a recently built neighborhood; an amazing alternative to living in a run down slum-like part of town where some houses havent been remodeled since the 1800's and others were made in a week and are literally just walls of cinder blocks with no paint or ornamentation.\n\n|Downsides|\nSince it's M\u00e9xico and we have our lovely government, the execution of the concept hasn't been perfect. From funds going 'missing' to projects being abandoned halfway through because not that many homes presold, there's no lack of controversy around these neighborhoods. And, of course, being so cheap has attracted a slew of criminal activity to these areas.\nThis is more of an issue in certain cities, but it could happen anywhere with enough neglect - criminal organizations buy up these homes and turn them into hideouts/ storehouses/ drug labs/ etc. or (worse imo) street criminals and addicts take over abandoned houses, making the neighborhoods unsafe for anyone wanting to live there. One final negative, due to these spots often being built far out from city center and following an American suburban design- they're car centric af. In larger cities they're built a 2 hour drive from the important financial districts so that residents struggle to find work, end up working lower income jobs closer by, or risk their safety on a multi-hour daily commute.\n\nOverall, many of these issues and more apply to the alternative 'organically built' low income neighborhoods and if I were in that situation I would much rather live in the government houses but there are many things that could be done to improve their safety, accessibility, and infrastructure.",

It avoids sprawl, encroachment on natural areas, habitat loss, and NIMBYism--because no one even HAS a back yard, or the back yards are all the same and already occupied.\n\nMaybe a sort of Central Park-like green area in the middle would help too.",

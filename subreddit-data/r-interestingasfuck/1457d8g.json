It's still fusing something, so it's still fusion. Combustion consumes oxygen, fusion makes it.",

That being said, there's no need to go around correcting everyone because they're approximately correct anyways.\n\nYour responses let me know that you are absolutely ridiculous though, so I doubt my words will convince you. My only guess is you wanted some reddit people to think that you're really smart and know about nuclear fusion or something, but that's not at all the impression you're giving.

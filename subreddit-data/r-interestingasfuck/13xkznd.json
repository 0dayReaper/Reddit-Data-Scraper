            "comment": "I was thinking about the Milky Way the other day. The center of it obscures our view of the other side and everything beyond it. Sure, we'll get to see those portions of space when our Sun makes it's way over there in 50,000 years, but in the meantime it's just a big object in our field of view. Perhaps if our Sun was much closer towards the center of the Milky Way, we wouldn't get much of a look at the far reaches of space at all.\n\nI often think of all the other \"Goldilocks\" planets in our galaxy and other galaxies. However life evolved/is evolving/will evolve on those planets, there are certain constants we know they will live with, like the periodic table, for instance. They will have silicon, they will discover glass, they will discover light refraction, they will build telescopes, and they will stare out into space. \n\nIn my wandering thoughts I pictured a far away star and planet whose location is perfectly nestled inside a gas nebula. The view of deep space is almost completely obscured from every latitude, except for perhaps one \"hole\" through which scientists eventually peer through with advanced optics, discovering a sea of galaxies similar to what we discovered not long ago with the Hubble Deep Field Image.\n\nI'm sure chaos and religious persecution would ensue upon new discoveries like this. Another constant throughout the galaxies?",

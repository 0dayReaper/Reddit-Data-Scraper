A friend of mine worked in steel construction quality control in China, and told me that a big problem was low- or middle-level workers replacing one quality of material (steel, concrete) with another type, and that simply because the other material was cheaper or easier to get. The guys he caught doing it often literally didn\u2019t understand what the problem was. Probably shaving corners on \u201cnow let the concrete set for 24 hours\u201d is also a problem.\n\nJust in passing, it\u2019s \u201cvoil\u00e0\u201d or \u201cvoila\u201d. \u201cVoila\u201d has another meaning in French but if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t care to put the accent it\u2019s not a problem in English. \u201cViola\u201d however has two other different meanings, one of them is English and is a music instrument, and the other is French and offensive, and that\u2019s quite enough for one word without being confused with another one.",

One local was quoted in the article as saying that \"the supervising agencies did not check to see if it met the national standards.\"\\[14\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The state-controlled media has largely ignored the tofu-dregs schoolhouses, under directives from the propaganda bureau's instructions.

This has, as an example, also been Putins downfall and why his army is is such poor condition and is the case in all dictatorships. (altho I guess technically india isnt a dictatorship. but it eventually happens in all large organisations which is why people have to be moved to different positions regularly.)",

    "postText": "A large quantity of a highly toxic industrial fire retardant, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), had been confused at the manufacturing plant with a nutritional supplement for cattle feed. As a result, there had been a massive, slow poisoning of dairy herds for almost a year before the accident was discovered. It was estimated that throughout that time virtually all 9 million people living in Michigan had been ingesting contaminated meat and milk on a daily basis.",

I mean I\u2019m not a party person but I do like to partake in some industrial fire retardant every once in a while. If after a long week I can\u2019t sit down and open up a can of polybrominated biphenyl then this country is going in the wrong direction",

Who is raking in the supposed cash from big fluoride?\n\nAlso do you understand the difference between Fluorine the element and Fluoride molecules?  Did you know elements take on dramatically different properties when combined into molecules?\n\nA good analogy is table salt.  Elemental chlorine is toxic but we literally cannot survive without sodium chloride, which si perfectly safe to consume in measured quantities.",

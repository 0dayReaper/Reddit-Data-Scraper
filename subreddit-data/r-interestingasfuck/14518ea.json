There\u2019s no going back. \n\nTime is nothing to the forest, but everything to you. 100 years spent, no friends or family remain. Your way of life forgotten.\n\nLonely, you decide to teach these peoples the way of their elders. You share your story. You try to remember the melody that drew you into the forest like a moth to a flame 100 years ago. \n\nThe Elder Flute God watches from atop a tree, far far away. He grins.",

The tune starts low and haunting and then fills the room with its duel notes, the air goes black. You wake up in the forest, it is dark, you are alone, but the unkept man stands in the far distance.*",

The transition was seamless, as if reality itself had been woven into the threads of an enigmatic dream. The canopy above cast an ethereal dimness, dappled by the pale glow of the moon that peeked through the dense foliage.\n\nWith a rising sense of unease, you realized you were no longer in the realm you once knew. Your heart quickened its pace as you took in your surroundings\u2014a clearing in the woods, carpeted with a lush bed of moss that whispered underfoot. The air was heavy with a musky scent, redolent of damp earth and ancient secrets.\n\nThe peculiar man remained in the distance, his figure barely discernible through the veil of darkness. He stood tall and still, his silhouette merging with the gnarled trees that reached toward the starlit heavens. It was as though he had been part of this place all along, a manifestation of the very essence that permeated the forest.\n\nA sense of curiosity mingled with trepidation as you cautiously approached him, your footsteps muffled by the soft undergrowth. The man turned his gaze toward you, his eyes gleaming with an intensity that seemed to pierce through your very soul. He wore an expression of knowing, as if he had anticipated this encounter all along.\n\nDrawing nearer, you noticed the intricate patterns etched into his weathered face, lines that spoke of countless stories and untold wisdom. His clothes, though tattered and worn, seemed to blend seamlessly with the woodland backdrop\u2014a harmony of earth tones and faded hues. The antler branch he had wielded on the stage was now clasped loosely in his grasp, its branches like ancient tendrils reaching for the heavens.\n\nSilence enveloped you, broken only by the gentle rustle of leaves in the wind. The man's lips parted, and a voice emerged\u2014a melody intertwined with words, whispered in a language forgotten by time itself. It carried on the breeze, painting vivid images in your mind's eye, evoking emotions that ran the gamut from joy to sorrow.\n\nWith each passing moment, the forest seemed to awaken, as if responding to the enchantment woven by the man's song. Ethereal beings flitted through the shadows, their luminous forms flickering like fireflies. The trees themselves appeared to sway in time with the haunting melody, their branches extending toward the source of the music.\n\nLost in this otherworldly symphony, you realized that the man possessed a connection to the very heart of nature\u2014an ancient magic that allowed him to bridge the gap between realms. He was a conduit for the forgotten stories of the forest, a guardian of its secrets and its soul.\n\nAs the song reached its crescendo, a burst of light erupted from the antler branch, illuminating the surroundings with a radiant glow. You shielded your eyes, momentarily blinded by the brilliance. When your vision cleared, the man and the forest had disappeared, leaving you standing alone in the clearing.\n\nWith a newfound reverence for the mysteries of the natural world, you took a deep breath, savoring the earthy scent that hung in the air. Though you had returned to the familiar realm of your own reality, you carried with you the echoes of that enchanted encounter\u2014a reminder of the profound connection that exists between humanity and the wilderness that surrounds us.\n\nFrom that day forward, you vowed to listen more closely to the whispers of the wind, to seek solace in the rustling leaves, and to appreciate the beauty of the world that thrived beyond the confines of civilization. For you had been touched by the forest's magic, forever bound to the memory of the man who played the song of nature.",

Daniel is a craftsman of incredible skill and his instruments are beyond amazing. Any collector or lover of unusual instruments/flutes should consider themselves incredibly lucky to have one of his instruments. He is also an incredible musician and performs sound bath type experiences where he plays many different instruments (including the flute) simultaneously. Also worth noting that no animals are harmed. The antlers he uses are naturally shed.\nBonus fact: I think his largest flute (full rack of antlers) went to Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.\n\nEdit: spelling plus more info",

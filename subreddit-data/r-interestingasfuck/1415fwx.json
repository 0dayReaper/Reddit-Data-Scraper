The oar is going to be heavier, if you try and paddle when the boat is already moving this speed, it will be really tough getting any actual force behind it.\n\nBut if on the back stroke you continue the paddle's momentum upwards, then use the weight to generate more momentum on the downswing, they get might get some force into the stroke without overexerting themselves.\n\nThat's how I view it anyways. At some point a paddles gotta be heavy enough where you won't want to stop it's momentum for each stroke\n\nEdit: I see you clearly pointed out this possibility already",

Thats over a 100 dudes doing it at the same time , it adds up ...u comparing this to the hawain outrigger  canoe  isn't really logical as both it has much much less oarsmen .... The only thing commen between the cannoe and this boat is that they float \nAlso in this video , they are just practicing, in the race the people in the back mostly only do this when nearing the finish line  for any last bit gain in momentum and push , and they do it much faster than this .",

So why doesn't the whole boat do this then if it's faster? Is it just because the back oars are longer and it's easier to maintain momentum back to the top of the stroke (what I asked originally)",

And since it is this big , they cant real use it the same way as the rest of the guys who have much smaller oars which can be used normally ...So i say again ... This is definitely not for show",

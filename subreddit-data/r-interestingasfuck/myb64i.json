They bolted the fuck out after the first plane and were safe, thank god.\n\nETA: The wording has been confusing people; when I say \u201c2 died years later\u201d, I mean two relatives died many years later - roughly early 2010s, not they died 2 years later in 2013 lol. \n\nAlso, as I said in another comment - I was 4 years old on 9/11.

Two items from that jumped to my mind:\n\n* If I recall correctly, there  was some sort of fire retardant that was spray applied to the super structure on the upper floors.  Computer modeling was extremely primitive at the time,  but the architects did manage to model the actual impact of a airplane hitting the building and how to structurally mitigate it.  What the modeling couldn't extrapolate was that the force of an impact would also come with a shock wave that would  literally blow all the fire retardant off of the superstructure like wind on a dry dandelion head leaving it fully unprotected - which is apparently exactly what happened.\n* Both planes were fully fueled for a transcontinental flight.  Again, modeling was done to optimize the water dispersion and drainage pattern from the sprinkler system,  but the modeling couldn't extrapolate that jet fuel from an aircraft (especially in such a huge quantity) would follow the same drainage routes.",

The friction produced by all of that material abrasing against itself was enough to super heat it, and I had read somewhere that if a human being was caught up in that cloud of debris as it came down, the mass generated so much static electricity that it would have killed a herd of elephants if it discharged, which is almost more terrifying than being crushed by the debris.\nEven if there hadn't been asbestos and other clearly toxic materials, the typical building materials that we generally see as safe become toxic when turned to such a fine dust as it's nearly impossible to keep out of your system. Cells damaged by things is how cancer starts, and first responders got so much fine particles in their lungs that it was nearly guaranteed that they'd develop some sort of lung disease like mesothelioma and/or cancer.\nI've been doing disaster recovery and business continuity planning for 20 years, and as you can imagine, 9/11 completely rewrote the book on emergency response protocol for mass casualty events.",

Some teachers tried talk about it or add context but most didn't know what to say either.\n\nI remember in my first class of the day, watching the news as the second plane hit and the absolute astonishment when we knew for certain this was no accident. Older people would remember other attacks on the trade center but to a naive sixteen year old, it had never even occured to my that a foreign power could even attack the united states.\n\nGrowing up in the fantasy land of the 90s, people quit their jobs for no reason and had a new one the next week. Kids joined the army just for college money and never saw combat. The whole world seemed socially progressive from my perspective. Heck, Nelson Mandela was president of South Africa. It felt like we were one generation away from a Star Trek-like utopia. I lot changed after that day.\n\nEdit: The one thing I will absolutely never, ever, ever forget from that day was watching people jump to their certain deaths from the windows on the upper floors to escape dying in the fires. It was live on TV. People on the other side of the country were actually killing themselves as I sat there in my desk and all anyone could do was watch. That hopelessness hits me hard to this day.",

I was always shit at any kind of math, so I was trying to pay attention to whatever my teacher was talking about, sort of zoning out, when another teacher came in and told us what was going on. My math teacher hooked up a TV and turned it on to CNN. The first plane had already hit some time before, and the second plane had hit right after he turned it on, and we were seeing recent replays. The bell rang but nobody was going anywhere to their next classes. We watched the towers implode from an aerial shot. We still weren't sure if it was an accident or not, but that second plane didn't seem like an accident to me, at the time. \n\nSomebody mentioned Al Qaeda, and I remembered hearing about them at some point over the past year or so...but I didn't really follow the news that much back then, so I really didn't know much about it. I think I recalled a movie with Denzel Washington called \"The Siege,\" which had come out a few years before, but it was nothing like this; this was so much worse, so much more unimaginable, but it was happening, live. \n\nI really don't remember much about the rest of the day. A few of us wondered if there would be a draft, and I figured if there was, then I would surely be drafted because I was a younger child. But then I wondered where the military would even be sent off to. I learned a few weeks later that somebody from my town had been killed in one of the towers. I didn't know her, my mom knew her and her mother. \n\nI felt the same way about the world before then: how things seemed like they were mostly looking up...but then, that thought pretty much evaporated. I never felt very optimistic about much of anything after that. Later on, I learned how things weren't really that great for everybody, anyway. In the next few years, I got pretty jaded about, well, everything, and that lasted for long than I'd have hoped for.",

We sat down and less than 10 minutes later the second plane hit. We stayed in home room until lunch. What struck me about that day was how silent everyone was. \n\nAfter school I went to work, it was the deadest night ever. Anyone who came us spoke softly. Like somehow that would make it not real.",

I drove through Manhattan Beach and was heading towards Playa del Rey, and I thought to myself, \u201cHuh, there are no planes in the sky.\u201d I assumed they reversed the takeoff pattern due to the winds. Then I noticed a voicemail on my phone and it was my mom telling me that my brother was ok. His apartment was in Battery Park, and he works at 1 Battery Park Plaza a few blocks away. He overslept at his then girlfriend\u2019s, now wife\u2019s apartment in midtown. I still had no idea what was going on. So I turned on the radio, and holy shit. The second plane had hit the towers. When I got to work in Santa Monica, everyone was watching the tv in the conference room. The CEO of our company (60sM) had previously worked in real estate and finance and was very good friends with a lot of the people that worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, which was located on floors 101-105 of Tower 1. He came into the room, and said, \u201cAll my friends are dead. They\u2019re all dead.\u201d And then he told everyone to get back to work. It was so weird. We all went to our desks and it was just silent in the office. All of us (maybe 40 employees in the company) were just by ourselves trying to find information about what was going on while pretending to go about our day. I remember the DBA coming over to me, btw I was a 28F Graphic Designer at the time, and he whispered in my ear, \u201cThe second tower just fell\u201d.\n\nIt took everything I had to keep it together. I\u2019m from CT and had tons of friends and family in and around the WTC at the time. Next thing you know we get a company-wide email sent from the CEO reminding us that we had to be in the office extra early the following morning and dressed in business attire because we had investors flying in from the east coast. I realize looking back that he was just in shock and denial, but it was all just so bizarre.\n\nMy sister\u2019s best friend from college died. She was 25 years old and had just started a job on the 93rd floor of the north tower. Another friend of mine from high school was working retail in the stores below ground and she got out. My brother would have been on a subway near ground zero had he not overslept. He got engaged to his now wife, and after they were married, in lieu of a honeymoon, they moved to Montana for 6 months where he could learn to fly fish. He\u2019s a lawyer and they let him work part time remotely. There\u2019s a word for it and I can\u2019t remember what it is. She spent that time working on paintings (she\u2019s a professional artist).\n\nIt all seems like a dream now. Everything changed that day.",

We didn't see it live on TV, we had to listen to the news on the radio. Later in the day my unit and all of our equipment and cannons (I was in a 6 gun towed artillery unit) were staged in a field next to a major road.  People were honking their horns at us as they drove by.  They thought we were staging to go to war.  Little did any of us know that 2 years later we would be the first combat troops breaching the Iraqi border.  My unit had 32 marines killed in the first 2 weeks, 19 of them died on the first day of fighting (March 23rd 2003). When I got out of the service I managed to graduate college with honors and landed a job in Manhattan with Citigroup.  Now I live in a converted motel and cant even hold a job as a laborer. Jesus, how this affected my life I won't ever be able to explain.  It is my \"life\". WAS my \"life\".  People aren't meant to do things like this to each other. A lot of us were ruined or never even got that chance.  Fuck me.  Fuck violence.  Nobody knew what was coming. Nobody knew anything.  Be kind to one another. It's just not worth it. Ever.\n\nMultiple edits because I'm a fucking mess right now. That's where my handle comes from (rainmaker) \"death rain\", artillery, 19 guys, 1 day. I used to think it was cool.

Then, if you aren\u2019t already, contact the medical side for behavioral health and get seen ASAP. The VA actually can be very helpful with your care. Once you have been seen, contact the DAV or another VA rep for claims and get your service connected disability. You clearly have PTSD at the very least, assuming nothing else. If you get a 70% rating, you can get $1444 right now, if you get 100%, which I would venture you could be eligible for, it\u2019s $3146 month tax free. \n\nIf op or anyone else sees this, I\u2019m a 90% disabled vet who has a decent understanding of the VA ratings schedule and how to navigate the healthcare system, shoot me a message. If I can\u2019t answer a question I can direct you to someone that can!",

The principal came over the intercom and said something about an \u201cattack on America\u201d but gave no further details. Spanish class went on as usual. \n\nNext period was chemistry, and the teacher turned on the TV and we mostly just sat there in stunned silence, learning what had happened. I believe it was early in that period that the towers collapsed. \n\nDuring show choir, we got in a circle and prayed - teacher included. During my lunch period, at least 90% of us went outside and prayed around the flagpole. Bear in mind that only about 25-30% of my town attends church regularly. \n\nMaking things worse, I also had a dog who was dying of cancer. We drove to pick her up from the vet hospital at the nearest big city that afternoon. We had been hoping they could do more than the local vets could, but the cancer had spread too far. She died six days later.",

All over the place, there were people on air urging everyone to go to blood centers. There were people calling in, asking how they could help, and everyone said go donate blood. Then it got to the point where they were saying wait, never mind, stop coming, you've donated too much blood.\n\nIt was incredibly sobering of a thought to know now, 20 years in the future, that they never ended up needing a single drop of all that blood.\n\nSide note, it *was* incredible to have a sudden boom in blood supply. I read articles that had comments from nurses etc that were involved with response (or lack thereof) that expressed bitterness that it took something so overt and sensationalized to urge us to do something as simple as donating some blood to help save the lives of strangers.",

At one point we thought a missile was fired into the tower. We smelled the smoke and could see a haze in the distance. We couldn't see the tower directly cause there were tall buildings closer that blocked out the skyline at that angle, so we just waited for more news. \n\nEventually my mom showed up a little after our lunch break to take me home - she worked in downtown NYC and was on the opposite side of the tower but roughly the same distance as my school was . She had left work and took one of the last running trains - only for it to stop running between stops and they had to evacuate everyone on the train on foot through a dark subway tunnel, and then had to finish the walk on foot because the trains weren't running for obvious reasons. She had walked over the Brooklyn bridge on foot with thousands of other pedestrians, everyone freaking out and spewing out theories and information that was trickling in pre-smartphones. \n\nBy the time she got to my school she was a mess. As we walked out of the building, ill never forget as we walked out of the doors of the school, there was a security guard phone, and a woman was seated using the phone...she was covered in head to toe in thick white soot, kind of like a powdered donut. We walked all the home through the streets of Brooklyn in a daze, the entire city smell of smoke and a plume of visible smoke coming from Manhataan...it was a fucking nightmare.",

I was one of the youngest people in my area of the plant and one of the only people who liked to listen to the radio on my headphones while I worked. We weren't allowed speakers.  At first there was a small news break about what they thought might have been a small air plane or helicopter that crashed into the world trade center. I started telling others around me about the news I was hearing. Slowly more and more information started coming out and I was simultaneously relaying that info to my coworkers. Soon there was a group of people around me listening to what I was saying. To this day I think about that and I still feel bad about the excitement I had over all of it when it was first happening. The way I relayed the info with excitement in my voice. I don't know why. Maybe I was just young and dumb living a boring life and to me it was a long ways away. Sort of a distant happening. At one point an older guy I worked with said something like \"OMG so many people must be losing their lives\". I looked around and seen the hint of fear and sadness in other people and it all hit me at once. Like, wow this is real, this is really going down and I still feel guilty with the way I handled that.",

Took many years of casual-documentary-watching and eventually learning about it through wikipedia, old news articles and youtube to realize the sheer gravity of what had happened.",

People jackets purses phones all over the floor everyone running to get out. Then we were told to get back into grand central and the trains would bring us to Stamford and return for more people.",

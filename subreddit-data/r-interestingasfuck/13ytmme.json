There was a sheath on the wrist that contained a knife for close-quarter combat. The suit also contained a Pepper spray capsule for emergency situations. Hurtubise stated that this could be used to incapacitate 40 insurgents. This was supposedly made possible because his capsule would contain 3% oleoresin capsicum. However, it would be illegal to use in a combat situation, as capsicum is banned for use in war by the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention.*\n\n*The helmet utilized both an intake fan and an exhaust fan to keep the soldier who wore it from overheating in countries like Iraq and Afghanistan. It also included a perfectly centered laser targeting system to mark a target to be taken out by a sniper or assault vehicle. Hurtubise integrated a voice-activated radio into the helmet for easy communication. Two high-power lights were integrated into the side of the helmet. Hurtubise also included a voice-changing mechanism in the suit's helmet.*\n\n*A compartment on the left arm contained a small vial of salt for the soldier, and the inventor stated that each Trojan suit would contain one dose of morphine. Also, a \"last-words\" recorder could be taken off of a soldier and given to the family of the soldier. A transponder chip was included that can be swallowed by a soldier so that he could be extracted. A light transponder on the chest could also be activated to signal a helicopter.*\n\n*On the right leg was a small remote-controlled surveillance robot. The soldier watched the robot on a small fold-out screen on the left leg. A military time world clock was integrated into the groin protector that Hurtubise claimed was \"where it's got to be.\" One of the shoes also had a small handheld shovel locked into it.*",

The reason tear gas and other chemical irritants (ie pepper spray) are banned for use in wartime is because of the chaotic and unclear nature of warfare it would be incredibly difficult to tell the difference between such irritants and a legitimate chemical weapon attack.  This could easily lead to retaliatory strikes using real chemical weapons and further escalation.",

Like there's a reason that bike helmets save lives.  I'd think that as long as it blunts impacts and prevents the force of his own weight from bending his body in ways it shouldn't, it would actually prevent the worst of the injuries.  Not that I'd really want to test that myself.",

The idea was that the bear would try to get in, get bored, and resume its normal activities, which the researcher could then watch and record. The first bear show up, batted at the cage a bit and realized it wasn\u2019t going to get in very easily but rather than giving up it settled into meticulously batting at the cage over and over again to weaken it over time. The researcher had to radio out to be picked up because he hadn\u2019t tested the cage for hours of constant abuse and the bear was determined to eat him no matter how long it took.",

Soldiers don't always treat their gear nicely so durability can sometimes outweigh initial performance or things like weight or comfort. Price can be a consideration too but not always. Perhaps some politics or backdealing did play into it by downplaying it's advantages but if you don't see the elite teams who do have a choice in their equipment wearing it, there's probably a good reason. The great thing about military specifications is that they are open and free for anyone to test stuff against. The military does actually want industry to develop new things so I can't see a widespread conspiracy against a single product making much sense.",

I would imagine they are (or were) designed in such a way that we wouldn't be able to  rack one open and learn much. Likely the technology used would be difficult to understand, either by design or just the fact that they are so much more advanced than we can comprehend. They would just monitor us to make sure we don't lose any threat to the primary civilization, or they are waiting for the right level of advancement to make official contact. \n\nThis is what we would do in this situation.",

Over the span of decades, that would be less than a crash every few years. \n\nIt could be survivors bias that only the \"top\" countries he mentioned are recovering UFOs to the point where there is an arms race. \n\nCould be:\n\nA: UFOs generally visit the \"top\" countries, cus that's where the crazy shit is going on so more opportunities for crashes and therefore recoveries\n\nB: less developed countries lack the means to identify and recover crashes before they are lost. If something crashed in the heart of the jungle in Brazil chances are it's never found before nature grows over it.\n\nPeople crash off the road and die, and are \"missing\" for weeks until their car is found in the brush a few hundred feet off the highway. Hell we discover whole ass human civilizations in dense jungle. \n\nAgain I'm not saying this random dude is concrete proof and I'm full on ayylien hype train. I just think it's a bit silly to write the whole thing off as IMPOSSIBLE just because a crash would be unlikely.",

One went like this: \"a UFO piloted by a hook-nosed black-triangle alien with skinny arms and glowing red eyes crushed our swingset. It tried to grab me so I stabbed it with a knife, but then later my dad got mad at me about the swingset so he beat me up.\" As a child, I did not notice the importance of the way that story ended.\n* One was a very matter-of-fact story, but told by a fellow child.\n\nNobody I know has ever told me of any such story in all the time since we all got phones in our pockets.

Also, who's to say they don't 'crash' on purpose for some unknown reason, perhaps to give us exposure to them a little at a time? Also, not knowing their technology, who can say how reliable they are. Maneuvering within an atmosphere is much different than coasting through space for millenia.  What if they are time machines coming back from the future? What if they live in our oceans, or have bases within our solar system?  Saturn has over 200 moons alone. I'm not claiming to know anything about them, but your comment seems somewhat short-sighted. Accidents happen all the time, with all technology. Things wear out, or are defective.",

It's like they've been conditioned to just instantly dismiss anything that's different from what they already know.\n\nForget the various grifters, forget the assumptions and all that. Just looking at the evidence that we have is more than enough to know that something big is going on. Every bit of sensor tech we have says many of these flying objects are real items, not sensor ghosts. The fact that they're occasionally seen making maneuvers that are far beyond what known propulsion tech can do is the only part that truly matters.\n\nPlus just use a bit of common damn sense and the entire thing starts making sense. If the government is seeing things flying around and knows it's not ours or the soviets, but these things are flying in our protected airspace and there seems to be nothing we can do to stop them, do you really think the government in the middle of the cold war is going to come out and tell the public about it? Why would they? \"Hey there's something flying in our airspace, we don't know what it is and we can't do shit to stop them. Sleep well America!\" Yeah right.\n\n\nThis guy is saying some insane stuff I'll agree but his credentials look real. All of this depends on the US military telling us what they know, even if it's nothing more than what we already know.",

Description:

For anything interesting as fuck

Rules:

Rule 1: This post is not IAF: Things that aren't IAF: 

Something you made, like art or a bracelet

mildly interesting (architecture, earthporn, AI art, illusions)

Social media screenshots, or screenshots in general.

No unnecessary sound

Memes, funny things, edgy content

Things that are purely cute

Porn/NSFL things

Click bait, "Top 10 best X"

Just because something is old (historyporn) does not inherently make it IAF

**This is not a complete list of what isn't IAF**

Rule 2: Post doesn't have a descriptive title: Make sure your title is descriptive. Users should be able to know what the post is generally about or if it's a pun they should get the joke after viewing the content of the post. If needed you can add additional information in the comment section. "This &lt;thing&gt;" is not an adequate title.

Titles should not be the only thing interesting about the post.

Title should not "piggy back" off other interesting posts. Example: "I see we're posting about X, well here's my X"

Rule 3: No Spam: Don't be a spammer. No self promotion/marketing/product shilling. No website/blog promotion.

Don't encourage shillbots by asking where to buy the nifty toy/gadget.

Rule 4: No Gossip or tabloid esque material: This isn't the place for pop culture news/events nor is it a glorified image version of /r/TodayILearned. No "talking head" videos without extensive proof. This is not a tiktok/social media rehosting site (not explicitly banned, but must be informative and backed by proof)

Rule 5: Proof needed, and not provided: If your post declares something as fact, please cite a source in the comment section. Do not claim ownership or creation of something you did not create. Do not post false or misleading information. Credible sources only for claims, no obscure blogs or twitter. As a courtesy for some interesting posts, please provide background information so that redditors can read for more info.

Rule 6: Uncivil: We are here to learn and share interesting things. Don't be a jerk.

Rule 7: No text on images: In most cases text on an image is useless. It can be put into the title or into the comment section. Text on gifs is sometimes useful, but still preferred to put information into the title and/or into the comment section. This also encourages discussion. There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly dates or little labeling on images/gifs/videos.
Subtitles and diagram labels are allowed, but distracting text, emoji, music on videos are not allowed.

Rule 8: Reposts: Usually there’s no ban for a repost, unless it’s done often due to karma farming. Reposts attract attention from mods who will check for bots, farming, shilling accounts.
Do not repost something that was posted within 2 months. Use the search tools.
If your reposts become an annoyance to mods, you will be banned.

If reporting a repost, provide a link to the previous post.

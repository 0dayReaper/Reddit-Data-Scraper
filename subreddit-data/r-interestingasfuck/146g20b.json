A boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion is a type of explosion unique to when fire surrounds a pressure vessel of flammable material. Ok so thats a lot but tldr as the release valve opens the liquid inside shoots out due to heat pressure. This creates space in the tank. That space is filled with the vapor propane. And if that vapor propane hits its flashpoint hoo boy thags a big boom. \n\nI work in the chemical industry that why i know this but they are not trying to close the release valve, they are trying to cool the tank so the expanding vapor does not build in the tank until a big boom. Also no the release valve does not melt open, its a pressure valve thats why it keeps opening and closing.",

They are very cool and obviously very important. There a many types of systems, some have the melting plugs, some valves, depends on tank size, contents etc. As a firefighter we'd usually let bbq tanks burn off vs pull them out of the fire, they can fail and explode even after being pulled from a fire, so like you said just keep them cool and stay back.",

When it gets under control, then they can attempt to put it out, if they do that. Why might they not? That house is gone, it's not able to be saved. By the time it gets under control, the fire might have already shrunk from consuming the avaliable materials.",

If his gaming setup aka his monitors/tower(s), audio systems were included in the 30k price then you can easily knock off 10k right there for the renovation itself.  As someone in the drywall trade and is around plenty of renovations, 20k for this very extravagant setup doesn't seem too bad",

An upper range of maybe 10k if he really splurged. It\u2019s a question of how good the motor is, how the tracks are hidden (is it actually inside the wall, or just hidden by the cabinets?), and how the door itself was made. \n\nAnd the cabinets are expensive, but not much different than any other built-in shelving you\u2019d put in an office or bedroom. \n\nOtherwise, no major rewiring or plumbing, no tilework, everything is painted white so you don\u2019t need fancy wood or stone, no appliances besides the door, so yeah, I could see this being under 30k even if you included chairs and computer gear in the cost.",

Mind you, that DIY involves stripping off all the wall coverings to the studs, replacing the studs that had rotted around the tub, chipping out the existing tile, replacing a tub, jackhammering a new drain to relocate the toilet, Durock wall skins with plaster where they weren't tiled, new sink, lights, tiling the floor and shower, new window in the wall where there was none before, crown molding, etc.  The GC had it done within 10 days (not bad in the greater scheme, he promised one week.)

In the US I think this would probably be closer to $40K, since it says he only paid $11,600 USD for the interior to be designed and fabricated, and everything else was stuff like the TVs and gaming rig, which are going to cost the same and don't involve a lot of labor.",

It's a person that has an entire lifetime of experiences etc that also inform who they are and what they want/need",

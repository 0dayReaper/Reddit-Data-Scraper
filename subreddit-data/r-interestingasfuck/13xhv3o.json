Because there is a huge difference between saying something like \"there have been reports of objects defying physics\" and actually having credible data to back those claims up. \n\nLoys of shit gets \"reported\" and then people like you conflate it for fact. In reality, there is probably faulty sensor data from mis-calibrated instruments that is getting \"reported\" or even just eye witness accounts which aren't worth a damn. \n\nAlso, you asked about refuting the tic tac case specifically. Naturally I can't since that data has never been released. \n\nBut I can tell you that it is a well established fact that the Navy had just deployed new sensors during those training exercises and we're having all sorts of issues calibrating them. That is undisputed. So any data from those exercises is immediately suspect. \n\nThe report said there is no credible evidence of anything defying physics.  And nothing to suggest an extraterrestrial origin. \n\nJust because something gets \"reported\" by allegedly credible people or suspect sensors doesn't make it reality.",

The bbs slow down yes but then fall quickly but in the video it wasn\u2019t falling down quick enough for those slow speeds. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s alien but it\u2019s 95% sure not from a shotgun. Slim chance it\u2019s at the top of its arch from being shot strait up and then the wind kept it level and exactly a few inches from the camera the whole time but that\u2019s lotto odds . But more likely is a candy wrapper in the wind.",

Even when they identify an object as a balloon or drone or whatever, it still remains technically unidentified unless they can also definitely say the origin/operator of the object. So lots of things that remain technically unidentified, are actually known objects but of unknown origin.",

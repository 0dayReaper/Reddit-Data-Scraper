Although they had never been in contact with a modern society, they knew there was other people out side their group, knew about planes and vehicles (at least that they existed).  \n\nPreviously they just didn't want to meet anyone new as they had met other groups in the past and it ended in fighting. For the most part the group still continued their way of life after making contact.",

However, European exploration and colonization during the early modern period brought indigenous peoples worldwide into contact with colonial settlers and explorers. As such, most indigenous groups have had some form of contact with other peoples. The term \"uncontacted\" therefore refers to a lack of sustained contact with the majority non-indigenous society at the present time.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontacted_peoples",

These people recognize that drone or helicopter as a technology of ours because they've been exposed to it many times. They have relationships with neighboring contacted tribes so we can speak to a lot of these groups through translators. We have explained ourselves, our flying machines, etc.\n\nThe only exception is the, maybe, North Sentinel Islanders who have had less contact than Amazonians and have no neighboring tribes as proxies to modernity, but they have also rejected us so its hard to know anything past a certain point. Truly uncontacted tribes probably don't exist in modernity.",

We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat.\"\n\n  \"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars.\"\n\n\"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines.\"\n\n  \"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact.\"\n\n\"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.\"\n\n  \"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat.\"\n\n  \"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.\"\n\n\"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?\"\n\n  \"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.\"\n\n\"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through.\"\n\n  \"No brain?\"\n\n\"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!\"\n\n  \"So... what does the thinking?\"\n\n\"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat.\"\n\n  \"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!\"\n\n\"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?\"\n\n  \"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat.\"\n\n\"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.\"\n\n  \"So what does the meat have in mind.\"\n\n\"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual.\"\n\n  \"We're supposed to talk to meat?\"\n\n\"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing.\"\n\n  \"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.\"\n\n  \"I thought you just told me they used radio.\"\n\n\"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.\"\n\n  \"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?\"\n\n\"Officially or unofficially?\"\n\n  \"Both.\"\n\n\"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing.\"\n\n  \"I was hoping you would say that.\"\n\n\"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?\"\n\n  \"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?\" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?\"\n\n\"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact.\"\n\n  \"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe.\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n  \"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?\"\n\n\"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them.\"\n\n\nEdit: not my original story. [info about the story here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They're_Made_Out_of_Meat) \n\nThanks to /u/ohmahjah for letting me know where it came from!",

It's incredibly sad:\n\nRegardless of evidence of the tribe's continued existence, \"FUNAI has denied that there is any evidence of the uncontacted tribe\u2019s presence. They have, however, held a secret meeting with Senator Zequinha Marinho, the notorious pro-Bolsonaro politician who, it has already been revealed, has lobbied secretly to open up Ituna Itat\u00e1 territory. In that meeting they showed the Senator the full report, which includes the locations where the evidence was discovered. Such highly sensitive information has been used in the past by ranchers and loggers to attack and kill uncontacted tribes in order to steal their land.\"\n\n\"...the official body that exists to defend Indigenous Peoples\u2019 rights is now actively working to wipe them out. It\u2019s genocide in action. If this isn\u2019t challenged and reversed, we\u2019ll witness the complete destruction of one of the most vulnerable peoples on the planet.\"",

They often visited and appeared pretty narrowly interested in getting their hands on as much scrap metal as possible. Scrap metal acquisition and fairly little curiosity towards visitors seems to be a theme in contact accounts, and among the local communities there are accounts of occasional trading expeditions to the island that went just fine.\n\nMy personal theory is that there have been many more instances of contact than we know about from fishermen, smugglers, poachers and so on who heard about this small untouched island and figured there would be easy pickings. The Sentinalese either realized they were being robbed blind or maybe even endured a few murders and collectively decided that the borders were no longer open. It's worth mentioning that the fishermen we know were murdered were hung like scarecrows for some time on the shore before being buried. That had never happened before and it was probably intended as a very clear warning to kindly stay off their land.\n\nEven the missionary who was killed didn't get attacked on sight. The Sentinalese visited with him several times, laughed and accepted some gifts. It was only after he sent his guides away that he was killed. That tracks with a group that's fine with mutually beneficial activities like trade, but who draw a hard line at settlers.",

It also gets tangled up into the \"Hollow Earth\" conspiracy, with the idea that it is the subterranean reptilians - descendants of dinosaurs that founded a civilization and fled underground to avoid the asteroid - that are keeping an eye on us with their gravity-controlling flying saucers that they fly into and out of the hole in the Antarctic that leads to the center of the Earth.",

They definitely know of the world outside, but choose to live deep in the forest. Its normally like a 25 hour hike from most villages in the area, deep within the forest so there are no known issues of the tribes needing to defend themselves. They mostly just want to practice their customs in peace and guard the deep part of the Amazon which they consider sacred.",

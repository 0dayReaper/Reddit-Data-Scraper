Dont think that will happen again this year but who knows.",

The boreal forests like that of Canada and Alaska follow close to 100-300 year cycles (if I remember correctly). Because of the long cycle when these forests do burn they generally have higher intensity. The fires from the 90s were probably more of the result of fire suppression as users below have commented (the fires in Yellowstone in the late 80s also point towards this). The past 30 years of \u201cbuildup\u201d likely wasn\u2019t really the issue with these, just the fact there\u2019s continual drought conditions.",

You go, unclip carabiner A, then clip it onto the next rung. You unclip carabiner B, and clip to the next rung.\n\nYou should never be able to fall if you just follow that as a safety precaution. You will have 1-2 clips on at all times.\n\nThose carabiners are rated to a few hundred pounds each. They're rated to like 4000+ lbf. Meaning, basically, they can catch 4000 falling pounds of weight, because lifting 4000 pounds isn't the same as catching 4000 pounds in freefall.\n\nI legitimately used climbing carabiners to lift an engine out of a car because we had chain, an engine hoist and lost the bolts to close the chain and my dog's collar was homemade with paracord and a climbing biner. Used the dog collar. Worked.\n\nIf it can lift an engine out of a car, it'll catch you falling off a mountain. You weigh a lot less than the engine.",

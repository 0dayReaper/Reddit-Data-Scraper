He served in WW2 and received a medal while stationed at Pearl Harbor during the attack. A story he never once talked about (but has been corroborated by multiple sources) is that he killed a man who challenged him to a fight with a single blow, earning him a reputation that made it all the way up to the highest level of the military and led to him becoming the personal body guard to a colonel for years. \n\nThere is so much more I wish I knew about the man but I do know he saw some insane stuff in his life and it never once broke him. Dude was an absolute beast until the day he died and I know it\u2019s 100% because he came from Ukraine.",

If I stumble across a video where they may mention it (typically American videos would), I naturally click off. I refuse to learn his name and so do a lot of other people. Dude wanted fame, he didn\u2019t get shit. \n\nA bit harder to remove Hitlers name, but even so, being just \u201csome guy\u201d is a powerful damn move.\n\nEditing to add: I should have guessed someone would say his name, silly me.

If we are to take at face value his statement regarding the restoration of a \"historical Russia\" it is fairly indistinguishable from Nazi expansionist aspirations, albeit under different pretexts.  A historical Russia, as in similar to the largest extend of the Empire of Russia, encompasses a large swath of thr globe.  It includes all of Eastern Europe, including all of Finland and some of Sweden.  Putin has said that one of his demands is for NATO to move back to their pre-1997 boundaries.  This is back to Germany.  Asking for Eastern Europe to once again be in thrall to Russia.\n\nHis statement was insane and if they are true aspirations (I don't think they are and I hope not)  he is nothing but a Hitler-esque assholes.\n\nI sincerely hope he does kill himself.  Generally I would never say that as I have lost friends and family to suicide.  But fuck Putin.  Fuck this man.  He lost all ability to negotiate when he invaded another country.  Reasons for doing so do not matter, you invaded you are wrong.\n\nIf you invade another country to act as a colonizers you deserve to be ground into a bloody pulp and hosed into the sewers.",

            "comment": "There is a running theme with Ukrainian politicians I've noticed throughout this whole sad chapter of history... They have big massive Steel Balls.\n\nThe president will not leave his people to suffer and die while he could turn tail and run. He's right there with them to the end.\n\nThe Mayor of Kyiv is an ex-boxer and has tooled up to fight Russians with his neighbours.\n\nThe ex-president has tooled up his neighborhood and is ready to fight and die for his people.\n\nThis guy stands in front of the world's powers and tells Putin to kill himself like a little bitch like Hitler did back in 1945.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTitanic Steel Fucking Balls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan we in the UK and US really say the same about our leaders? Would they stand up in the open while the bombs fall and tell Putin to fuck off? Or would they cower in their nuke-proof bunkers miles underground while their people get blown up defending their land?\n\nIf our leaders in the west were as bad ass as these fuckers are I think a lot less of us would be disillusioned with our respective ineffectual leaderships, because they'd actually get shit done.",

Before anyone comes after me, I was a very small child). \n\nThey live about the same length of time a human does, slightly longer in the wild than in captivity, but he kind of does live in the wild since he\u2019s always been an \u201coutside pet.\u201d \n\nWe had to take him for surgery once to remove a calcium stone, and there was another time we were fostering a really sweet but very dumb pit bull who thought he was a toy and he lost a toenail, but other than that, he\u2019s been a perfectly healthy and very good boy.",

What I said is merely a hypothesis.  It *is* true tortoise shells can succumb to fungi and bacteria, and that cleaning their shells is paramount to their health. \n\nIt is also true that the shell is an actual part of their body.  It doesn't have nerve endings directly on the surface of the shell, like skin (mostly), but it can feel pressure and other vibrations, and most living organisms enjoy the sensation of physical contact.",

They were both very big snugglers with my wife. The youngest one who is still with us is 8 and she hates being forcibly snuggled or held. My wife misses the other two a lot so she still picks her up and snuggles her which she'll deal with, but leaves after a bit. Whereas with me she'll climb on me and paw at me for pets and snuggles and it's because I leave her alone otherwise. I swear I'm going to buy a boxer next so she can have a guaranteed snuggler. I've never seen a boxer that didn't love having someone show it nothing but attention.",

She even decided to hop onto the Verizon tech's shoulders to supervise the one time. He thankfully found it hilarious. She also likes to lay on my chest with her face as close to mine as she can get.

Recently had my mind blown by crocodile intelligence on the \"behind the scenes\" show on the zoo section of Disney's Animal Kingdom park.

            "comment": "\nThe members of this genus (along with several related taxa) have a series of unique adaptations that facilitate this kind of camouflage behavior. Many of the *Dromiidae* crabs (e.g. hermit crabs, sponge crabs, shellback crabs, etc.) are equipped with a specialized pair of legs that enables the crab to hold a shell, sea sponge, and/or ascidian against their body, but shellback crabs also have a flexible, semi-membranous carapace that can be tucked more firmly into the contours of a bivalve shell, producing a suction mechanism that keeps the shell locked into place. \n\nThe body of the shellback crab is also covered in a very fine layer of hair-like structures called setae, and when the crab presses itself against the shell, these membranous \"hairs\" can take on an almost translucent appearance. \n\nTbh, I could not stop laughing at the *crabby* little faces on these guys. They've all got the same bemused/indignant expression...as if some random asshole has just walked up to them, shoved them over, and announced to the *entire fucking ocean* that there's a crab hiding beneath that disguise; as if that actually happens to them quite a lot, and they're getting really sick of it. \n\n#Sources &amp; More Info:\n- Crustaceana Monographs: [Comparison of the Shell-Carrying Behaviors of *Desmodromia,* *Conchoecetes,* and *Hypoconcha*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233997875_Another_shell-carrying_dromiid_crab_Desmodromia_tranterae_McLay_2001_from_the_Dampier_Archipelago_Western_Australia_and_observations_on_shell-acquisition_behaviour_in_Conchoecetes_artificiosus_Fabrici) **(the relevant info is on page 191)**\n- South Carolina Department of Natural Resources: [Shellback Crabs and their Larval Stages](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/sertc/HYPOCONCHA%2520som.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiO-sHFkK__AhUBI30KHZA9D3cQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ACOX1yJO4EjnSPibw1FNJ) **(PDF)**\n- South Carolina Public Radio: [Shellback Crabs](https://www.southcarolinapublicradio.org/show/naturenotes/2022-12-28/shellback-crabs)",

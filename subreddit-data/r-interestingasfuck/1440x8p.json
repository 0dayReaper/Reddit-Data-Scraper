Maybe we\u2019re looking at a &gt;45\u00b0 incline? In other words gravity isn\u2019t helping these vehicles stay planted on a &gt;45\u00b0 surface!

OP also confirmed that the road is a near 45\u00b0 incline.\n\nThis is looking to be more of a surface texture issue! I would imagine this to be quite a bumpy ride primarily for motorcyclists and maybe car drivers as well. It would be a bit tricky for a motorcycle to safely stand still/slow down. \n\nAs for car drivers, aha. I\u2019m still convinced there\u2019s another factor that\u2019s adding to the lack of traction due to the fact that that one taxi driver somehow slid down the road even with his tires completely still.\n\nIt\u2019s possibly that despite the ribs, the surface itself isn\u2019t gritty enough. Like driving down a glass road that has a ribbed surface. Bumpy ride maybe, but not gritty.",

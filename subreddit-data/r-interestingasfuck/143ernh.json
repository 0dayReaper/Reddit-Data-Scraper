It's an aging organ whose function is to filter toxins out of baby, and at the end of its lifespan... it's basically organ meat, maybe kidney or something like that. \n\nIt does contain calories and protein, and if you were giving birth during a famine or something like that, you might want to eat it to reclaim some of that. But it's not particularly nutritious. Many animals eat their placentas, both for nutrition and because predators will smell it and come eat their young.\n\nThe claim that placenta is extremely nutritious is alternative medicine, with no evidence to it, and is why some people have their placentas ground and dried and put into capsules to take as supplements. Some people even eat them like you would eat any piece of meat. But though it's largely harmless, there's no real reason to do it, not if you have good nutrition available.",

She actually didn't finish the bottle because they were so effective. We're not hippies; definitely a science-y family, so there's something to it. My thoughts were that it was something to do with hormones, but I also wouldn't rule out the placebo effect.",

It also encourages bonding with baby. But we can easily give oxytocin in the form of a nasal spray, which is a good deal easier that eating your baby's placenta! And anyway, most parents make lots of their own after giving birth and seeing that wrinkly little-old-man newborn face for the first time.",

So \"the baby's placenta\" is more technically correct, though they're both understandable and you can't really complain about \"my wife's placenta\" since it's clear what's meant. Technically, the placenta is the first organ we have--a large, temporary organ that we use to get nutrition and remove waste while we're in the uterus, and then discard when we no longer need it.",

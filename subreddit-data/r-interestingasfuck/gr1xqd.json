But also other details of considerable interest. Archaeologists have returned and collected new items in the hilly site just above the town of Negrar where the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in the 1920s. Since then, however, the site in the fields was almost forgotten and at the center of some attempts to find the remains of the residence dating back to the third century after Christ. But now the Roman villa of Negrar is slowly seeing the light again, with beautiful mosaic floors still well preserved in various places.*\n \n\n*In the summer of 2019, the technicians of the Superintendency of Archeology, Fine Arts and Landscape of Verona returned to dig after decades under the direction of the archaeologist Gianni de Zuccato. Then investigations continued in October 2019 and February of this year, until it stopped due to the coronavirus emergency . In May, the archaeologists resumed and in a week of excavation, with trenches between the rows of vineyards, they were able to confirm the data already in their possession from previous studies and add new ones in order to establish where exactly the villa was and what they were its size.*\n \n\n*Satisfied de Zuccato, who showed the latest rediscoveries to an enthusiastic Roberto Grison , mayor of Negrar di Valpolicella. \"We believe that a cultural site of this value deserves attention and should be enhanced,\" says Grison. \"For this reason, together with the Superintendency and the private individuals of agricultural funds, we will find a way to make this treasure enjoyable\".*\n\n**EDIT: This villa was discovered in 1922, and preserved** *under* **the vineyards since then.** I checked Google maps and it is a curiously large field to the north east of the town centre.  [Article from last year](https://www.larena.it/territori/valpolicella/negrar/nuovi-mosaici-sotto-al-vigneto-1.7535549)\n\n*Ancient mosaics under the vineyards. This is the beautiful discovery, on the hills above the village: a paved portion of the Roman villa of Negrar that starts to look for these days. The whole complex, among other things, may still be in good condition thanks to conservation under agricultural land. The villa, however, came out not exactly where it was thought to be. They resumed this summer, after about a century from the first archaeological excavations of 1922, carried out at the time by the Archaeological Superintendency of Venice, who directed Tina Campanile, and then partially resumed investigations on the Roman villa dated third century after Christ. The archaeologist Gianni de Zuccato, an officer of the Superintendency of Archeology, Fine Arts and Landscape, in recent weeks has probed in several places the private land where, according to the maps and the correspondence of the bell tower, the rooms decorated with mosaics of the ancient residence were to be found. This is not an easy operation, given that \"the excavation of 1922 is documented by diaries, reliefs and photographs, but it is devoid of a real location on the map\". The intervention directed by him, approved by the Superintendent Fabrizio Magani and carried out operationally by the archaeologist Alberto Manicardi della Sap (Padana Archaeological Society), constitutes \"the first phase of a research aimed at identifying the exact location and extent of the Roman villa, of which in 1922 revealed an area of \u200b\u200b270 square meters of the residential sector, with various rooms beautifully paved with mosaics \", explains de Zuccato. THE DISCOVERY. In July, digging started by opening a series of trenches thanks to a funding of 7,500 euros from the Ministry of Cultural Heritage. In the first chosen points, however, no trace of the mosaics. Only, so to speak, signs of structures that have never been previously identified, that is \u00abwalls, a pavement with stone slabs and three steps, probably belonging to a service sector of the residence\u00bb, continues de Zuccato. Then, finally, the northern limit of the excavation of 1922 peeped out and a portion of the mosaic pavement with geometric motifs was discovered. \"It could be the southern side of a large colonnaded portico, a peristyle, perhaps open onto an internal garden.\" And now? \"Thanks to additional ministerial funding already available, research will resume in the autumn, after the harvest is over, and will also be extended to nearby areas that could contain other remains, so as to identify the perimeter limits of the archaeological site to be subjected to adequate protection De Zuccato replies. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS. \"In addition to all this,\" concludes the archaeologist, \"the feasibility of a site enhancement project must be assessed together with the Municipality of Negrar di Valpolicella, with the creation of an archaeological area that allows public use\". Meanwhile, the mayor Roberto Grison has been in contact for a couple of years with him and the team of the Superintendency to fulfill the bureaucratic procedures, take care of relations with private individuals of the agricultural fund and encourage the carrying out of on-site investigations. \"Up to now, the owners of the land have understood the importance of the intervention and demonstrated their availability,\" says Grison. \"After almost 100 years we can finally say that the villa is there and know where it is, now all that remains is to continue.\"*",

All geological structures are eroding in some degree which means that they are, at all times, slowly falling apart, whether this is because of wind, water, something else or all, varies. The detritus (the small \"pieces\" that are falling off) will go with gravity until it can go no further (fx. At the end of a river or the bottom of a valley). So while it might only be a millimeter or a centimeter a year, lower areas will slowly be filled up with sediments and Bury what was before.\n\nIf you google sedimentary layers you get some beautiful pictures of layers of these \"pieces\" of mountains, hills, rivers etc. That has slowly filled in areas over time :)",

It was interesting the conversations I had with my guide...today, although we place a lot of value on preserving artifacts like this - in the past, especially in Italy, places and things like this were fairly common. Common enough, to the point that it may not have even been considered special, or noteworthy, 1,000 years ago by whoever may have owned the land.",

My guess is erosion of the mountains helped deposit the soil, perhaps a mudslide or two but you also get ~1\u201d of topsoil deposition a year on average. Say there was roughly 1,500 years since the end of the Roman Empire would mean about 125 feet of soil would be expected to be the average depth of soil accumulation. Which looks even less than what is shown here by a long shot.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s ~100 years to get 1\u201d of soil, not 1\u201d. It\u2019s been a long day and I guess I just had a brain fart.  And it\u2019s soil, not topsoil. I\u2019m no expert and didn\u2019t claim to be but I\u2019ve taken several geology classes as part of my degree which is where I knew the 1\u201d per century rule of thumb.

Think of the muddy streaks that pile up on a driveway corner. \n\nOne possibility is sometime in the last 1500 years, probably on the older end of that range, this land was unoccupied for long enough that dirt either accumulated slowly, or there were some significant floods or mudslides such that the ruins got covered over. It's also possible that an earthquake or sinkhole lowered that part of the land, which was later filled in on top by mud, flooding, and dirt. \n\n It also could have... well, traveled underground. Depending on how loose the underground water table is, stuff that is buried can actually move in a sort of underground mud river migration and end up in other places. Whether that's happened here or not will probably depend on how much they find intact (I assume).\n\nAnother possibility is that someone who lived there moved the dirt in at some point and covered up. Maybe to hide it, maybe it was in the way, maybe they just wanted to create viable farmland.",

And more often than you\u2019d think, people build new things over old ones. Thousands and thousands of even the lightest dustings really build up.\n\nI lived in Rome for a while and one of the strangest things to me was that almost all of the Roman ruins were a good 10-20 feet (3-6 meters) underground. Even in a city that\u2019s been continuously inhabited for thousands of years, things get buried and lost.\n\nRome has one of the worst subway systems in the world because every time they try to dig deep enough they to build it, they run into ancient ruins that need to be excavated. They\u2019ve been working on one particular subway line for about 20 years now, it\u2019s still incomplete. It\u2019s amusing to compare 20 years of modern day subway construction to the Colosseum, which only took 1-2 years to complete.\n\nI\u2019ve also lived in New York City, which has a very similar history. The island of Manhattan used to be considerably smaller, but after years of landfill and erosion (both artificial and natural) the island expanded to the size it is today. [This article] (https://ny.curbed.com/platform/amp/2013/5/6/10246784/when-wall-street-was-a-wall-a-1660-map-of-manhattan) has some interesting pictures on this if you scroll down. Interestingly, the Manhattan expansion happened in only 350 years because of so much activity and demand for land in New York City. It gives you a very good idea of how something like this could happen elsewhere.",

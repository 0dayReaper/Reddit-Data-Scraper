When I was told about being reunited with family and God FOREVER as a kid, it brought more worry than comfort. Infinity is a very long time and even if you're having a pretty good time I imagine even the good days would get pretty tiresome after your billionth-trillionth-decade of existence. Checking out of existence entirely at some eventual point is the only result that makes sense without sounding like a nightmare to me. Depending on the state of the world, living to a 1000 might be rad, but it would likely feel like playing an open world game where you finished the main and sides and are now just running around aimlessly killing stuff with OP weapons.",

Let's see if I can paraphrase:\n\n-she doesn't endorse any particular type of food, but rather believes that the most important contributing factor for her long life is love/care. Her diet was primarily and early-mid 20th century style standard Japanese diet. Rice, fish, seaweed, miso, nattou, green tea etc\n\n-she is apparently a Christian, which is very rare for Japanese. She's from the southern island of Kyushu where the Europeans were first allowed to trade and tried to make churches and whatnot so that is wheremost of the Japanese Christians are located.\n\n-she remembers the wars very well and had entry of stories about them\n\n-she didn't say that he \"looks like Jesus\". She thought he *was* Jesus and got a bit emotional and said to him in Japanese \"is that you? Have you finally come to take me home?\" Apparently, her caretakers asked the crew to leave and let her rest. At the continuation of the shooting, she apologized to him and said that her caretakers explained that he isn't actually Jesus and she understood that now and that she realizes he is just a cameraman from Tokyo.\n\n-she playa Go (an Asian boardgame) and Checkers daily to keep her mind sharp and was decent at both.\n\n-she said the hardest thing about living so long was that no one was left to relate to her, no one she could share memories with, having outlived all of her children and some of her grandchildren as well as all of her friends from school/youth\n\n-roommate said the impression he took from her was one of peace and wisdom, likened her to a time travel from a bygone era. He said that he personally believed she lived so long (after interacting with her) in order to help the Japanese retain the spirit of the Meiji era, when Japan was in flux in a major way and to help hold onto that constructive energy. (For what it's worth)",

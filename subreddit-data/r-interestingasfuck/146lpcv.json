It was nice to get a starting note without a piano or pitch pipe. But that\u2019s about where its usefulness ended. Part of singing with a group, especially in groups that sing arrangements with very complex, tight harmonies (think Nor\u2019Easters or Faux Paz) is adjusting to the singers around you to make sure everything sounds good in a relative sense. Sometimes, or a lot of times, the group will go a little flat or a little sharp, but no one notices because everyone is singing relative to each other, so it sounds good. Except when you have a member with perfect pitch.\n\nThey\u2019ll read the sheet music and know that the notes are \u201cA-C-D-A\u201d in order.  And that\u2019s what they\u2019ll sing, reliably, every time. Which can be great! But you know what happens when the group goes a half step flat during a performance? They have such a hard time adjusting from what\u2019s objectively the correct note, that they just keep singing what they learned off the sheet music and reinforced during practice. So you end up with a member who sounds sharp and it throws everything off. Which then throws off the people around them. Some people might follow the rest of the group and stay a half step flat. Others might follow the person with perfect pitch and stay on key. That results in an absolutely awful group sound. It\u2019s especially problematic during performances in stage where you can\u2019t properly hear yourself and have to just go by what people around you are doing. It happened to us during ICCA\u2019s one year and it was terrible.",

First, singing is using the body as an instrument, and it sorta self selects for people with naturally larger chests (because thoracic control is a massive part of opera vocals). You want a big mouth, throat, chest, even a big, expressive face for opera!\n\nSecond, all the work and practice with air intake and breath control leads to stronger thoracic muscles. There people can literally breathe more air and with more force than you and I could generate. All that lung stimulation may increase the production of leptin, a \u201chunger hormone\u201d. \n\nThird, and I\u2019ve heard my old roommate say this (he\u2019s an baritone opera singer) that your larynx and man other associated structures in the neighbourhood are resonators. It\u2019s thought that a nice layer of fat can kind of make the voice smoother and richer by affecting how your voice resonates.",

Hundreds of islands and inlets to explore. As we were wandering up bute inlet, there was this cool Sandy Beach. Sandy beaches are not common up here, and the inlet is super deep all the way to the shore so I could not anchor. Instead I just beached the boat and tossed the anchor in the sand to make sure it didn't float away if the tide was changing. We sat around in the sun in the summer on this Sandy Beach what seemed a million miles from other people. A waterfall coming down next to us. It seemed magical.\n\nWe got back on the boat and continued up the inlet and by the time we came back down the inlet and looked for our magic Sandy beach, it was gone. The tide had come in and now it was just rocks.\n\nThis little Oasis that shows up from time to time. Show up at the wrong time and you will never know it exists",

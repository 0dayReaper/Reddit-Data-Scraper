Aluminum mirrors are superior for most home and commercial uses, so you don't really see this method much outside of educational lab settings.\n\nIf you see an old mirror with brownish or blackish discoloration near the edges, that's the silver oxidizing. It's the reason why they aren't used much any more. Aluminum doesn't have that issue.",

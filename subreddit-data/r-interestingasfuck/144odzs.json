You strap in, they dunk you, roll you around until you're not sure which way is up, then you've got to get your seat belt undone, find the exit, or knock out the window, get your butt out,  find \"up\" and get yourself to the surface. \n\nThey do have divers there to help you if you can't do any of those steps.",

They had all but one window locked so I had to try to figure out which window was open, maintain my orientation, and finally escape.  The training is invaluable for anyone at a risk of an inadvertent helicopter overwater incident.  We had a few people panic and were unable to complete the training but I found the experience quite enjoyable.",

In a real situation you don\u2019t know what kind of structural damage will prevent you from using a window or door so it is important to be able to stay calm and find a solution out of the helicopter as the sink rate is ~10 feet/second.  To make it even more fun when you surface they have the wave generator running, loud thunder, and a heavy/cold rain shower.  The philosophy of our unit was train for the worst and hope for the best.",

Then you head outside and do exercises in the North Sea, and even with the suit on it is freezing.\n\nUAE has a lot of foreign labor on the rigs, and lots of them can't swim. They ask straight away. Like 50% of people couldn't swim, but they still made them complete the exercise. Even some of the people who said they could swim could barely dog paddle. Had to pluck a guy from the water after he tried to swim like 6 feet and made it about 2 ft before going under. \n\nPretty fun exercise overall.",

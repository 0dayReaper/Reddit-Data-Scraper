            "comment": "This device is called a [Farnsworth Fusor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor). Some are capable of inducing small amounts of fusion. The operating principle is that you have a cathode \"accelerator grid\" (the wire in OP's picture) which is held at a high negative potential (around -60 kV) which is inside an evacuated chamber filled with a fusable gas such as deuterium. The electrostatic potential will ionize the gas and attract the positively charged ions toward the center of the grid, causing them to collide and occasionally fuse. Here's [some videos and pictures](https://twitter.com/bencbartlett/status/1185681196056924160) of one of these devices which I built a few years ago.",

You can tell it\u2019s hollow cathode because of the color, and that beautiful cathode fall dark space. That blue beam is kev electrons flying out.\n\nYou need to get better vacuum, then it becomes way darker, but then you can get the crisp ion beams in \u201cstar mode\u201d happening. Just before yours goes out in the video you can see it. You need to hold it at those low pressures and maintain a plasma.\n\nSame goes for the dad in OPs post, except he hasn\u2019t gotten to hollow cathode mode yet.",

I remember reading something like that somewhere.\n\nEdit: Many have confirmed that a grape cut in half and touching slighting will in fact create plasma when microwaved. It can also be done with a lit match or candle, and apparently helps if you place a pyrex bowl over it. Also, people are saying don't try to make plasma in a microwave you plan of keeping around.

They\u2019re plasma?  Static electricity is plasma? I tend to drag my feet when I walk around the house from chronic pain, and I have killed a DVD player and two landline phones from walking over and touching them.  The second phone bit me as it it died \u2014 I felt the spark all the way to my elbow, and it hurt for several minutes.  I\u2019ve now trained myself to touch something metallic *that\u2019s not plugged in* before touching any electronics.\n\nOh, I almost forgot.  I once accidentally gave my ex-boyfriend an electric kiss.  It was shocking.  And very funny!  While I was laughing, that humorless bastard got irritated and acted like I did it on purpose.  Plasma kisses are really something, but mine was wasted on him.",

Liquid is a fluid that is practically incompressible. Gases are fluids that are commonly compressible, and plasmas are gases that are also electrically conductive. I\u2019m not a physicist, so I might be missing some nuance, but I have mechanical/aerospace engineering degrees, and that\u2019s the way the engineering department teaches it.",

That\u2019s why you can control and contain plasma by using a magnetic field.",

Most plasmas created on earth are arcs of electrons between two points, where the desire of the electrons to get from A to B are so great that it ionizes the air to create a pathway. The heat is hotter than the surface of the sun, so the metal on both ends of the arc will be vaporizing while it occurs. And you would probably hear from your dad about the power bill.",

There is something called breakdown voltage, which is the voltage at which an insulator (e.g. air) turns into a conductor (plasma). In a thunderstorm, an insane amount of charge builds up due to friction in the clouds, creating a very high potential difference (voltage) between the ground and the sky. If the difference is large enough, the air will ionize into plasma and create a conducting path to the surface where an insane discharge of energy (lightning) occurs.",

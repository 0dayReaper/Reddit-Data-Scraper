Now imagine if every other row of circles was shifted one half width to the right. You would then be able to move each row down a bit into the extra room. That way there is less dead space overall.  All the grow zones would still be circles the same size, but each circle would be close to other circles at 6 points instead of 4.  They were using shapes like squares and hexagons as they relate to maths regarding the concept of \"tiling a plane.\"\n\nThe answer though is likely property lines.  They might not be able to purchase property with a jagged edge and so within their land, if the change in tiling meathod does not add up to the full diameter of an extra row on each side, then it ultimately would not be worth the effort of the additional surveying and plumbing.",

In the midwest US fields are generally divided into sections (1 sq mile) and then quarters (1/4 square mile).  Over years and years they get carved up or consolidated into all types of funny shapes, but the circles you see here are likely quarter section sized fields.\n\nThere\u2019s a limit to how long a center pivot can be, especially if there are hills or creeks/ponds to contend with.\n\nA common practice is to see property owned in quarter section increments, which is 160 acres, and often in my area you\u2019ll see a pivot right in the center of that square quarter section.  1 pivot per quarter.  This creates a green circle of irrigated land under the area that the pivot sprinkler can provide water.\n\nIf a single farmer owns multiple quarters, and they are adjacently located, that farmer may pull out any fences or trees between those fields and overlap or otherwise optimize the pivot coverage to get more complete irrigation, like was asked earlier.\n\nBut even when it looks like this video, the corners don\u2019t go to waste.  You can plant dryland crops there, often in my area it\u2019s alfalfa or other grasses that are then baled up and sold as food for livestock.  Or, a family may choose to locate their farmhouse in that corner space, with outbuildings or pens for animals.\n\n\nAnd if your land is anything other than flat and open, your pivot sizes and complexity vary greatly.  You might need 2 pivots on a single quarter, one to handle each side of a river.  Then the view would show 1/2 circles, or some other shape based on the lay of the land.",

This is also one of the reasons they have to take off so fast is that they are only stable once they are up to speed.  Its a lot of cool engineering.",

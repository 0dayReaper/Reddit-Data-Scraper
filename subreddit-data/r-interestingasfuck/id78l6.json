When I got into them their top song/album had, what, 500K views on YouTube or something? And now it's 7M thanks to TikTok. I'm glad more people have found \"Russian doomer music\", but I didn't expect it to be through a viral TikTok.\n\nHopefully the wave of new Molchat Doma fans means that more people will find the likes of [N\u00fcrnberg](https://youtu.be/6KL_VE0UIMw), [Peremotka](https://youtu.be/4Vx_5ShWvic), [Durnoi Vkus](https://youtu.be/m9n1P8-8ANg), [Bumazhnye Tigry](https://youtu.be/M-kWaykABKk), [Chernikovskaya Hata](https://youtu.be/cCCIAaXh1mA), and [Gde Fantom](https://youtu.be/5TXq0MSiWVU). It's a Hell of a rabbit hole to fall down, and it'd be a shame if Molchat Doma \u2014 awesome as they are \u2014 took all the spotlight.\n\nEdit: [PLOHO](https://youtu.be/ZHhEHzVG6SE), [Konets Elektroniki](https://youtu.be/oiaGLN6tdpM), [Dom Modelei](https://youtu.be/U8dJ13zcpOU), and [Bushprit](https://youtu.be/OEYY6K_oKF0) too.\n\nEdit 2: Added links to my favorite songs by each act. For the record, most of these artists I found through a YouTube channel called [Krzysztof Utbult](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiapDtQFNXPhrDzbPLBpq8g).",

Based on what I saw happen to the sticks, coins, etc. and the fact that lava is quite dense since it is molten rock, here\u2019s what I think:\n\n1. If you jumped from high enough that it would kill you if you hit say, a sidewalk, then you would feel some real heat right before you died but the broken neck would save you from much suffering.\n\n2. If you jumped from a height where you would normally survive a fall onto stone, you would experience excruciating agony as your body burned on top of the lava. I\u2019m not sure you would even sink in much (coins did, sticks didn\u2019t).",

You would also burst into flames.",

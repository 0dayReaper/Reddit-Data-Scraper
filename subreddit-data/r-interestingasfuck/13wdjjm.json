It's very weird to fuck with human remains for no reason. It likely had spiritual or religious significance, because it so clearly is linked to death. The skull is a literal symbol for human death.\n\nSpending hours carving on human remains probably had some great significance and wasn't just doodling",

Or using it as a stand for something.

Tenet is the axis. It also forms two V crossing against each other (bottom left to up and to right; upper right to bottom and to left). 4 Smaller circles also say \"sator opera\".\n\nIf this is Latin, the meaning is \"tenet\" = holds/he holds, \"opera\" = work, \"rotas\" = wheels, \"sator\" =sower/founder/tailor. Could be an rebus for something like \"He holds the works of the wheels\"/ \"works holds the wheels\" / \"the wheels hold the works\" / \"He holds the wheels of work\". Maybe it's about work as a self operating system/self work endlessly. Through creation/ fine Craftmanship.\n\nJust some jester's shenanigans.",

This translation would be consistent with the generally accepted belief in the late Middle Age, that the Sator-God would be the ultimate engine of the universe.\n\n\nChanging the reading order at the end of each row or column, the palindrome appear as follows: \u201cSATOR OPERA TENET AREPO ROTAS\u201d, where the word SATOR is used in the meaning of the Sower and the word AREPO can be translated as a contraction of Areopago (i.e., the Supreme Court).  As a result the palindrome as a whole could be translated as follows: \u201cThe sower decides his daily works, but only the Supreme Court decides upon his destiny\u201d. In this sense, the palindrome holds a moral meaning as: \u201cMen determine their daily activities, but only God shapes their destiny\u201d.",

Otherwise you can lose what was created initially. \n\nI have also seen this saying when trying to explain how evolution takes place within a genome of a being. How evolution must be a large single step change. If you begin to add new letters to the palindrome to \"evolve\" the saying then it stops being a palindrome in the same way that a gradual change to the genome would dissipate the structure to a point where it simply would not exist.",

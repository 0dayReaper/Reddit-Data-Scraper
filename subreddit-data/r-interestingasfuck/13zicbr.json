Russia is guilty of war crimes and evil beyond measure and Ukraine is corrupt and has US funded Bio labs in it. Both suck and neither are Americas problem or business.",

From a military stand point, if you're enemy is running off the books labs next door you're gonna want them gone, and want anyone involved gone as well. I'm just repeating what I've read though cause I haven't seen these labs first hand and don't have the security clearance to do the digging to find out the validity of such claims.

Of course, there's been plenty of space-related deaths, but were any of these actually far enough away from Earth to qualify as 'died in space'?\n\nChallenger was still in the atmosphere when it exploded, Columbia went on re-entry, so I'd say those don't count.\n\nAccording to [this source](https://www.newscientist.com/question/anyone-ever-died-space/), our best bet could be Soyuz 11:\n\n&gt; In 1971 all three of the Soyuz 11 mission crew died when their capsule depressurised **before re-entry** on their way back from humanity\u2019s first ever stay on a space station, Salyut 1.",

So air coming into the bottle die to low pressure and shooting out when he stops sucking due to inertia and slightly higher pressure in the bottle.",

So it slowly started reaching around to his face, enveloping him in a bubble of water. He got inside while it was mostly covering his eyes, and managed to get the helmet off before he aspirated it. Drowning in space is a very real possibility. \n\nHis solution was to wrap one of the diapers that they have on station around the back of his head. I assume they fixed the problem, though I never heard why it happened.",

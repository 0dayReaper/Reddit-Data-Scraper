I actually know some of the guys who\u2019ve been on the team given I trained with Jordan Burroughs for a few years and flew out to Colorado Springs for some sessions with them. They hate that shit, but that also kind of comes down to wrestlers in general in the US. Not sure why wrestling specifically is like that but when I played football and baseball, I knew many guys who were on steroids. Same with basketball, though I\u2019m not sure what they were using exactly. They just called it pumping up or taking pump up at my school at the time (2012-16). \n\nI do know many other countries do juice their wrestlers, but atleast in the US it\u2019s completely shamed within the inner circles. Also anyone going to final x on Saturday? I can\u2019t fucking wait\n\nEdit: obviously it\u2019s shamed everywhere, I just mean in specifics to our wrestling team the team itself shamed it",

They are all using PED's. especially when it comes to domestic competition! You can throw mma fighters and boxers in there as well. Several other Olympic sports too apart from weightlifting and judo",

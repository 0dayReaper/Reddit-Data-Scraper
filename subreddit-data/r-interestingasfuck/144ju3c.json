I remember searching up how he died, and that rabbit hole eventually led to a YouTube video talking about highlights of what he ate, and holy shit.\n\nEdit: went and looked for it again.\n\n-He was famous for his peanut butter banana and bacon sandwiches, he ate them every day, and showed his maid how to cook it in bacon grease \n\n- he also loved to eat bacon and mustard sandwiches, fried peanut butter, hamburger steak and crowder peas.\n\n-another one of his favourite snack was fried okra and mnms\n\n-he ate mac n cheese daily\n\n-quote from his cousin, Danny Smith, Elvis would order \u201cgobs and gobs\u201d of burgers. The food chain called Krystal was one of his favourites.\n\n-he enjoyed meatloaf and mashed potatoes so much that he ate it for dinner every day for six months straight (he would get obsessed with a meal to the point where he would eat it daily, like so, then switch to a different meal to obsess over later when he got bored of it)\n\n-his favourite dessert was an entire chocolate cake\n\n-after he had died, they found a lot of frozen snacks in his fridge and freezer \n\nThose are only highlights\u2026",

I just ate them for lunch or if I was craving I would eat a big meal by 6pm and have smoothies at the ready. \n\nAfter about two weeks you get used to the routine. But that\u2019s it - sticking to the routine. \n\nOne of my favorites is throwing a bunch of diff canned beans, corn, onions, carrots, radishes, Romain, kale, and tuna and make a crazy salad.

                            "comment": "OJ was acquitted as well but anyway here are 10 undeniable facts about the sexual-abuse allegations against Michael Jackson.\n\n1. There is no dispute that, at age 34, Michael Jackson slept more than 30 nights in a row in the same bed with 13-year-old Jordie Chandler at the boy\u2019s house with Chandler\u2019s mother present. He also slept in the same bed with Jordie Chandler at Chandler\u2019s father\u2019s house. The parents were divorced.\n\n2. So far, five boys Michael Jackson shared beds with have accused him of abuse: Jordie Chandler, Jason Francia, Gavin Arvizo, Wade Robson, and Jimmy Safechuck. Jackson had the same nickname for Chandler and Arvizo: \u201cRubba.\u201d He called Robson \u201cLittle One\u201d and Safechuck \u201cApplehead.\u201d\n\n3. Jackson paid $25 million to settle the Chandlers\u2019 lawsuit, with $18 million going to Jordie, $2.5 million to each of the parents, and the rest to lawyers. Jackson said he paid that sum to avoid something \u201clong and drawn out.\u201d Francia also received $2.4 million from Jackson.\n\n4. Michael Jackson suffered from the skin discoloration disease vitiligo. Jordie Chandler drew a picture of the markings on the underside of Jackson\u2019s penis. His drawings were sealed in an envelope. A few months later, investigators photographed Jackson\u2019s genitalia. The photographs matched Chandler\u2019s drawings.\n\n5. The hallway leading to Jackson\u2019s bedroom was a serious security zone covered by video and wired for sound so that the steps of anyone approaching would make ding-dong sounds.\n\n6. Jackson had an extensive collection of adult erotic material he kept in a suitcase next to his bed, including S&amp;M bondage photos and a study of naked boys. Forensic experts with experience in the Secret Service found the fingerprints of boys alongside Jackson\u2019s on the same pages. Jackson also had bondage sculptures of women with ball gags in their mouths on his desk, in full view of the boys who slept there.\n\n7. According to the Neverland staff interviewed by the Santa Barbara authorities, no one ever saw or knew of a woman spending the night with Michael Jackson, including his two spouses, Debbie Rowe or Lisa Marie Presley. Rowe, the mother of two of Jackson\u2019s children, made it clear to the Santa Barbara authorities that she never had sex with Jackson.\n\n8. The parents of boys Jackson shared beds with were courted assiduously and given myriad expensive gifts. Wade Robson\u2019s mother testified in the 2005 trial that she funneled wages through Jackson\u2019s company and was given a permanent resident visa. Jimmy Safechuck\u2019s parents got a house. Jordie Chandler\u2019s mother got a diamond bracelet.\n\n9. Two of the fathers of those who have accused Jackson, Jordie Chandler and Wade Robson, committed suicide. Both were estranged from their sons at the time.\n\n10. In a 2002 documentary, Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson told Martin Bashir there was nothing wrong with sharing his bed with boys.\n\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/03/10-undeniable-facts-about-the-michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-allegations\n\nNumber 6 is weird and rather hard to innocently explain, don't you think?",

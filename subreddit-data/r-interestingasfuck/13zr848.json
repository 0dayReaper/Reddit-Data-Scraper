The best story I have is the first time I ever smoked weed I went to my dad's restaurant to get some good food. When I arrived my father and hunter immediately knew what was up and made me sit on the less used side of the restaurant.  While I was sitting there Hunter came over and asked if I had any more and I told him no because I thought he was a \"narc\". After I saw the movie I told my father about me thinking Hunter was a narc and he couldn't stop laughing and told me that clearly no narcs are going to get me if I thought Hunter didn't have street cred. A bunch of other people in my family have far better stories because they were older and actually knew who he was, he was pretty locally famous which was weird in Aspen.",

They turned up small amounts of Cocaine and marijuana. The charges were thrown out once the fruit of the poison tree was excluded.",

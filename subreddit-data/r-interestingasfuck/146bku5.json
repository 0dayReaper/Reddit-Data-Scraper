You can hear the same hum of the water flowing both before and after in the background which does not change cadence or pitch. Then, when the bird is dropped you can hear his pitter patter overlayed on the same speed hum of the water flow. It would be almost impossible for a regular person to separate both noise signals and change the speed of one while overlaying it on the other without any sound glitching and at the same audio resolution. Additionally, you can see in the bottom left corner the ripples of the waves hitting the shore at the same speed both before and after the bird is put down.",

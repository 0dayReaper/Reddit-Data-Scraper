The sun came down, touched the horizon, and went right back up!     \n\nSunset and sunrise at the same time. It was very cool, but the 24/7 daylight thing got old *very* fast. Combined with jet lag, it totally screwed with my sleep cycle.    \nEveryone who lives there has very thick blackout curtains.",

I never asked him what it was like during the summer but I imagine it's about the same. I live in the NorthEast US (NYC), and it's depressing as hell when the sun comes up at 7 am and sets at like 4:30 PM. I had to buy thick blackout curtains because the sun also comes up about 6 AM and I tend to sleep late.",

Even that is enough to seriously mess with me.\n\nI do love the summer tho - tonight it was almost 11pm before it got dark, we had a beautifully long dusk with a big blood red sunset.\n\nNo wonder ancient people worshipped the sun, it's fucking magical.",

It might be helpful for you too, although you would also need full blackout curtains for every window. Most of those lights will have a timer setting where you can mimic the sunset by having them get progressively dimmer and warmer in hue over a set period of time. If you block out all of the light from outside before the lights start to dim then you might be able to trick your brain into thinking it\u2019s an actual sunset. The opposite would also work in the winter to emulate sunrise.",

According to them, the fire wasn\u2019t actually the worst part as it stopped about a block from their house, they got very lucky damage wise. The insurance companies and parasitic cleaning services trying to provide shoddy recovery have stretched their ordeal on for YEARS, though. They\u2019re supposed to clean up a lot of stuff because all of the smoke from burning houses is chock full of shit you don\u2019t want in your lungs, but if you\u2019re affected by a forest fire instead I would imagine the clean up process would be different.",

You hardly ever see anyone with a voice box anymore. My grandpa has a fake jaw from cancer from years of smoking and eventually chewing.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the support. Also just wanna note that a bunch of you are saying ecigs are worse than cigs with absolutely no basis in scientific fact.

When I worked at one I have a lot of stories about the shitty things management did. They once made me bring in my grandfather's obituary to approve my *unpaid* time off to attend his funeral.\n\nMy \"favorite\" though was when our state's minimum wage went up by 50 cents about a month before my annual review (only time they would possibly give raises). So my review went great and they said I was doing a fantastic job. I asked what my raise would be and they said minimum wage just went up, so that was my raise that year. Awesome, so your \"fantastic\" employee is making the same as the guy that started today, thanks so much!\n\nEdit: another one I thought of. They paid $0.01 over minimum wage. A manager literally told me they did this to get on some list of top companies that start workers above minimum wage.",

Opened in 1997, the Center is a marvel of anti-fire engineering. Both indoors and outdoors, its materials, design, construction, operations, and controls are purpose-built for safety.\n\n&gt; Procedures were immediately put into place to make sure there was adequate staffing and on-site preparation. The grounds crew assisted firefighters by preparing the ground to decrease risks. They also turned on irrigation to help saturate areas where firefighters are working.\n\n&gt; Walls are built of reinforced concrete or fire-protected steel, while the buildings are designed with fire separations, in which doors can isolate any problem areas from the rest of the site. \u201cWith separations, if a fire starts, it doesn\u2019t have the ability to travel,\u201d Rogers said. Roofs are also covered with stone aggregate, which is fire-resistant.\n\n&gt; To guard against smoke that could harm people and damage art, a carbon-filtered air conditioning system maintains a pressure flow\u2014which can be increased as needed\u2014that pressurizes the building to keep smoke and ash out. \u201cIf there\u2019s a fire in the building, we have ways to manage smoke so people can evacuate safely, and firefighters can get in and deal with it quickly,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nReally incredible to read about.",

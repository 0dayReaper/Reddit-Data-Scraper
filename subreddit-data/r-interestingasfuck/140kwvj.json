Classic cars were built for the car to survive over the driver in a crash, versus modern cars are built to have the driver survive over the car. When a car is totaled you can get it replaced, you can\u2019t replace the person who died in the accident.",

Also, seat belts tend to not fit well across women's chests because of height and the bulk of breasts; the seat belts tend to sit up higher which can cause some injuries across the throat instead of the chest.  \n\nCadavers still get used in crash tests, in addition to the dummies, but more of them are men and almost none are children, which is another huge problem for safety design.  But then, it's tough to ask a grieving parent to donate their child's body to science, so the crash test dummies are our next best option.  \n\nIf you get the chance to read Mary Roach's book \"Stiff\", she has a chapter that addresses the use of cadavers in crash tests.  It's a very good book, in my opinion.",

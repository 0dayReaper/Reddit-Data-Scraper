They all thought the test would be much farther away than it actually was. He said a lot of soldiers were crying and begging for their lives during it. Insane they treated it like a fireworks show for the soldiers.",

My father was military, based out in Nellis and then worked in Vegas. He's had lymphoma.\n\nEdit: talked with my mom after someone linked me an article and I read the years the bombing was active. Wasn't her in the pictures, I got the timeline mixed up. She was born too late. It was one of her cousins! V sorry for the confusion.",

I don\u2019t know how old you are, I\u2019m 50 and when in 3rd and 4th grade, we had visits from Holocaust survivors and a man who\u2019d survived either Hiroshima or Nagasaki (can\u2019t remember which). They did not hold back in their descriptions of the horrors they witnessed, though we were 8 to 10 years old. The man who\u2019d witnessed the bomb looked like he\u2019d been melted, not just burnt, and it seemed impossible anyone could have survived that, but there he was.  \n\nBack in the 70s-80s it seemed common for schools to have guest speakers on those topics, and to show assembly videos that were quite graphic. Some of the PSA videos could make you never want to leave your house again.",

I saw someone get shot in the leg, and as he crawled by my doorway I was covering in I grabbed him and dragged him inside. As I was kneeling over him all hyped up on adrenaline, I looked down and I was patting his legs with my gloved hands and then checking them for blood without even conciously knowing i was doing it. This is exactly what you are trained to do because you can't usually feel blood through your gloves. I remeber being kind of shocked by my body just working while my brain was trying to catch up.",

He would wait in the hospital on numerous occasions while doctors took her away. She didn't really get better, so he asked her just what they were doing.\n\nIIRC her reply was something like \"they take my clothes off and take pictures of me\".

The question of using nuclear weapons isn't about \"the people\"  it's about power.  If the government (yours or *theirs*) believes that using one will be beneficial to retaining their power, or gaining more, they will.  How many die is only a means to apply pressure.\n\nMutually assured destruction is about 'you take mine, I'll take yours'.  It's a selfish deterrent.  But there's all sorts of ways that people are made to suffer for these exact reasons, just fortunately few result in a mushroom cloud... but the deaths are continual.",

They gamble with the very lives of their people, who they see only as a number. They consider some of those numbers expendable and they tell us its for \"the greater good.\" \n\nBut those numbers are LIVES. Mothers, Fathers, children, Grandparents - people who contributed to the world and people who *could have* contributed if they hadn't been seen as \"just a number/casualty.\" \n\nThe power to utterly destroy life at the touch of a button simply should not exist. It will be the extinction of the human race.",

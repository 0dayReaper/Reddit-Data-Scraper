Emergency notices went out the next day after the fire started. People were finding out they were in evacuation zones through hobby news services.

You press through and hope you find safety.\n\nUPDATE: Hat tip to [Halifax Fire News](https://twitter.com/HRMFireNews), I think he saved a lot of people",

My understanding (from local news) is that the emergency alerts did not start until the next day.\n\nThe fire department did close off the area to travel, but that fire is out of control and sweeping over houses. Most of those areas only have one road out, so it was a pretty dramatic couple of days (week) while people figured out what was going on.\n\nPeople were learning if they were in evacuation areas through an [independant twitter account](https://twitter.com/HRMFireNews) telling people where the fire was. There was very little official communication.\n\n[https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/environment/fires/nova-scotia-fires/](https://www.halifaxexaminer.ca/environment/fires/nova-scotia-fires/)",

Things have gotten this bad because colonizers took the control burning as a threat to their livelihoods, like you are expressing, and put an end to the practice. They didn't realize it as a necessary part of the ecosystem THEY were INVADING. instead worried about their PERSONAL belongings?? How FAKE. \n\nWhat were smaller fires that would routinely burn up available fuel while protecting the new growing foliage are now unspeakable sizes because we destroyed Natives and their practices, added to climate change which in turn affected the intensity of El Ni\u00f1o each year, now WOMP WOMP here we are!! \n\nLike take a step off your high horse. WE made it get this bad by being really pompous white people. GTFO and stop caring so much about the communities built on stolen land! Sorry your house has to go up in flames because your ancestors started a domino effect that would carry over into modern legislation!!! \n\nMaybe we should have pretended to care about the planet and the fact that it has been a self-sustaining ecosystem FOR LITERALLY MILLIONS OF YEARS. WHEN WE KNOW THIS SEASON APPROACHES EVERY YEAR!  Nope. Still act SHOCKED when things go to shit?  Also you literally explained that 50% of these fires are caused by irresponsible humans? WOMP WOMP maybe you should be upset at all the shitty gender reveal parties that got us here!",

It's not because they've been taught to be afraid of white people, it's just because it's something they haven't seen before. They settle down after a few weeks, but people are mostly afraid of the unknown, something new, and different. It's probably partly where racism came from in its early days, that and our brains grouping biases.",

All the kids were happy go lucky about it and were unaffected by their parents bigotry and the blatant rampant racism around them? Texas in 1971 sounds like a pretty brutal racist place considering just a few decades prior grabbing an innocent black man and hanging him to a tree, brutally torturing and mutilating him slowly, and gathering up the whole town including children to watch and participate and enjoy themselves, was acceptable behavior. Like the people who did that were still alive and in the community and you may have even known some. And your telling me all the kids at your school were cool with desegregation and didn\u2019t harbor their parents hatred? So the reason racism continued when these not racist kids grew up is because they became racists as adults, it wasn\u2019t in them as children when they\u2019re most heavily influence by their parents?\n\nMy parents generation, they always talk about not seeing color, they never cared, they never thought about it. And it just sounds like burying your head in the sand when I can go and look at the history and see how the awful racism from the times. \n\nI would argue with kids every single day in my middle and high school that there was nothing wrong with being gay, that they deserved peace and happiness. These kids would parrot the most heinous shit that their parents said about gay people, and sometimes would violently attack them. And I have a hard time believing the same shit wasn\u2019t happening in schools in 1971 Texas with kids with bigoted parents.",

We did wonder what all the screaming and yelling at home was about, but at school, no... we had no issues with the kids. It was more kids for us to play with.\n\nWe can't and couldn't hold a candle to the bigotry today, by Gen Z. Those losers win all awards for hate, violence, shooting up school, racism, bigotry, an inability to agree to disagree, and an absolute lack of social skills.\n\nI'll take my generation ANY day over today. No way would I want to be a kid today. I grew up in the 60s and 70s. Hippy generation that loved everyone.\n\nGen Z... they are pretty damn close to how my parents were in the 30s. History repeating itself, that's just a damn shame. Some people just refuse to learn from history, they have to repeat the same mistakes due to sheer ignorance.",

The schools in the \"black\" areas were underfunded and poorly. To be bused in to a \"white\" school meant going to a good school. It meant getting a better education.\n\nDesegregation involved busing/transporting children, both black and white, away from their neighborhood schools to different schools with a mixture of people from different neighborhoods, since at the time \"black\" kids usually lived in poorer neighborhoods and \"white\" kids in richer ones.. it was a big mix and mash for everyone, which is part of why even people who were not very racist, still didn't like all the changes.. since it meant their kids had to change schools and start over somewhere new.  That is why some of the questions were about when this new school would feel more like \"their school\" , when would they feel more at home in the new place.",

There's a chance this is before/ramp up of the exodus of manufacturing jobs (my mind goes to cars), before/beginning of the insane price gouging for housing, if you look at those myriad charts where they show the average wage vs the cost of living it's probably before it was just cartoonishly unbalanced.  A time where commercials for Unions would be broadcasted on television.\n\nSo everything I'm saying wraps back to money, but with that sort of things comes stability and a sense of calm.  Strip that for a couple of generations and you have instability and fear of the future.  Instability and fear of the future is a loaded comment with lots of baggage, and who could have foreseen the internets impact through social media which time and time again seems to make us sad and angry. This is much more modern and I think we all know how anger and sadness manifests. (I'm aware of social influence being present at all times of human society but I'm litterally typing this ok my cell phone, next level influence in my pocket)\n\nAnd it's hard to pinpoint the problem.  We can look at individuals or groups, political parties and religions.  I really think the problem is trying to squeeze water from a stone as far as money goes.  After generations of, how can I squeeze every last dime out of a situation, how can I raise rent more, how can I get more views on my brand (eyeballs translate into money), where on the planet can my company be placed to get more money, what careers can I pursue to make more money. What decisions can I make to assure that people have less influence on how they receive money so that I or the people I represent can get more money(declinations of unions, unseen price gouging of health insurance, portion sizes for food shrinking)\n\nWith money comes power and then the groups, political parties, and religions can exploit situations to have lopsided power through more money (Tax exemptions, gerrymandering, subsidies, intentional misdirection). I hope we reach a next stage of capitalism (or whatever we are), that sees our current conditions as unsustainable and we focus on curing whatever we created to make us this suicidal, bigoted (for both parties it's always, at least I'm not X!), unstable mess.\n\nEdit: since the direction of counterpoints seem to be, sharing examples of violence in the past, I'm not refuting that I'm talking of the experience of the average citizen, their access to money and how it impacted them over generations",

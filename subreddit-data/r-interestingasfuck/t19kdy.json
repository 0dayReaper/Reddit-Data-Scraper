Seemed to perk up for years, although still refusing to talk about it, would fluctuate in mood regularly,  until he started sliding downhill again and eventually he killed himself.  I was 7 at the time.  I never know how he died until I was in my early 20's, given the nature of his death - it's horrible knowing why he did it, and what his last exact words were on this life.  Sometimes I wish I never knew.\n\nWar fucking sucks.",

My grandfather was a teenager during WWII in Estonia. He was proud for all the Nazis he killed and when the Soviets came he proudly kept killing them until my Grandma got pregnant then they fled to Sweden and eventually Canada. He would not openly talk about it outside of Estonians he trusted because he had been betrayed once and family; but when he did he stood tall. He would show off his missing thumb that he got fleeing a Soviet attack on one of their meetings (the one they had been betrayed about) and how his little group had inflicted so many more casualties to any they suffered.",

A year later, Ukraine is still at war. Russian missiles are still falling from the sky and people are still dying.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The military decided it needed to make the volunteer units more professional and only those with previous military experience were allowed to stay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fursin and Arieva were asked to leave the force.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[...\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As the first anniversary of the war \u2014 and their wedding \u2014 approaches, Arieva and Fursin are reflecting on how the year has changed them.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Arieva said she is a completely different person. \u201cI became less naive and less childish. And maybe it has made me a little bit stronger. Because what doesn\u2019t kill us, makes us stronger, of course,\u201d she said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cOnly when you see this, you understand the value of life. And for me, this is 100%,\u201d Fursin said. \u201cWhat we went through together, I understand that \\[we are\\] completely different. And that we \\[continue\\] to love each other, that, for me, is maybe the biggest sign that it\u2019s true love,\u201d he said.\n\nsource:\n\n[https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/23/europe/ukraine-married-couple-anniversary-russia-war-intl-cmd/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/23/europe/ukraine-married-couple-anniversary-russia-war-intl-cmd/index.html)",

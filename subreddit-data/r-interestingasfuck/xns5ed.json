Where do I begin, man? I go to work for Gregory Illinivich, and all day long I work. Honestly doc, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing anymore. I don\u2019t even know if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and that seems to bring him happiness. But I don\u2019t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there\u2026 at night I\u2026I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that\u2019s on my arm. A lady that I once loved, doc. I don\u2019t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the\u2026in the cold of last year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch\u2026 I no longer love him. As much as it pains me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I\u2026 that I catch when I take a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn\u2019t such a coward, then perhaps\u2026perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me and end this hellish facade once and for all\u2026Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I\u2019m a moth, just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I\u2019m not feeling good. And so the doctor says, \u201cMoth, man, you\u2019re troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here?\u201d\n\nAnd the moth says, \u201c\u2018Cause the light was on.\n\n- Norm Macdonald",

It ain't pretty.\n\nSame thing, by the way, applies to many cheap household LED and \"economy\" (CFL) bulbs. If you're always depressed at home, perhaps it's because you cannot see the true colors in it. Including your partner's skin tone, your own reflection in the mirror, kids, pets\u2026 try installing some CRI 100 (or at least 80, if you cannot afford 100) bulbs and see what happens.",

Planck units are simply units created only by using universal constants (speed of light, boltzman constant, planck constant, gravitational constant) rather than anything human beings care about (e.g. 1 metre originally = 1 ten millionth of the north pole-equator distance). No theory in physics suggests the universe is divided into planck units.  This is more obvious when considering the large units like planck energy (~2x10^9 joules / roughly 0.5t of TNT) or planck temperature (~1.4x10^32 Kelvin - so inconceivably large it's impossible to relate anything to it, a supernova is around 1x10^10 Kelvin)",

But you gotta drive slow in some parts, because some parts only have one drivable Lane right now.\n\nBut last week this insane woman was driving behind me. I've been tailgated, but this bitch was on a while different level. I was going the exact same speed as everyone in front of me. But she starts tailgating me. Then she moves to flashing her brights at me and honking. At first I thought she was trying to get my attention, like to tell me my break lights were out or something like that. Every single time I slowed down because the cars in front of me were slowing down, she got super close, flickered her brights, and honked. She also kept swerving like she was gonna pass me, which is incredibly stupid when there's major construction going on.\n\nMy blood pressure skyrocketed, and this went on for A WHOLE HOUR. I was terrified she was going to hit me (luckily I have good insurance). She was so fucking angry, and I didn't do anything! Even if I wanted to speed up I couldn't. There were about 5 or 6 cars in front of me!\n\nFinally I turned down the street that goes to my house. I opened up my sun roof and flicked her off. I was super close to flinging my coffee at her but I didn't. That bitch didn't justify littering.",

Probably somewhere within $450,000 of just lights up there.\n\nOne other fun fact is something called \u201cCondor Duty\u201d where an electric has to go up in the condor while they shoot.

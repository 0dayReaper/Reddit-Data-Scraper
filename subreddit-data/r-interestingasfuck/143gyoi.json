It's also highly unusual to receive a knife (of *any* kind, let alone one intended as a tool for suicide!) as a wedding gift, which makes me suspect it was given simply as a gift and unrelated to the marriage that's mentioned.\n\nGreat symbolic meaning is given to certain things when it comes to wedding gifts in Japan and anything that cuts is a big no-no, as it symbolises the couple being separated into two parts. Similarly sets of things, such as cups or plates, will never be an even number, as they're too easily split in two; something you don't want to suggest when giving a gift to a newly joined couple. This is why gift sets of things in Japan are invariably sold in odd numbers of items.",

I'm guessing the 'blade' was a cast piece (looking at the odd pitting) and never meant to be seen; which wouldn't ever be used on a tanto intended for use.",

I think only a handful of the locks in this entire canal are electric/hydraulic. \n\nIt takes about an hour to get through the exceptionally beautiful Jones falls and it's four lock systems",

Sometimes they have both inbound and outbound vessels crossing at the same time and there are areas that are too narrow for two vessels so they have one set of vessels either outbound or inbound moor first at one point and wait, allow the other vessels to pass, unmoor the previous vessels and proceed. But if you remove all those factors, you're looking at 10 to 12. I will never forget it because everyone needed to stay up during this whole time.",

However, the actual time can vary depending on the size of the ship, the amount of traffic in the canal, and any unforeseen delays. For example, a large container ship may take up to 12 hours to cross the canal, while a smaller yacht may only take 6 hours.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the typical time it takes a ship to cross the Panama Canal:\n\nLockage time: This is the time it takes for a ship to ascend or descend the locks. The locks are a series of chambers that raise and lower ships to different elevations as they pass through the canal. Lockage time can vary depending on the size of the ship and the number of locks it must pass through.\n\nPassage time: This is the time it takes for a ship to travel between the locks. Passage time is typically around 2 hours for a large container ship.\n\nWaiting time: Ships may have to wait in line to cross the canal, especially during busy periods. Waiting time can vary depending on the time of year and the amount of traffic in the canal.\n\nOverall, the average time it takes a ship to cross the Panama Canal is 8 to 10 hours. However, the actual time can vary depending on a number of factors.\"",

There\u2019s a fascinating book that talks about it called The Tycoon\u2019s War. The tycoon is Cornelius Vanderbilt, who spent a lot of money trying to get steamships through Nicaragua. But it also intersects with the story of William Walker, a Texan who managed to become the president of (an albeit divided) Nicaragua for a short time. \n\nLong story short, the proposed Nicaraguan canal actually would have required dredging of less land than the Panama Canal did. Even though Nicaragua is much wider than Panama, there is a big ass lake (Lake Nicaragua) that is only about 10-15 miles from the Pacific coast. So you\u2019d have to dredge that. Then you\u2019d just sail across the lake and down the rivers the come off of it and run to Atlantic. If I recall correctly, the river they would use was difficult to traverse though. So they would have had to do some work to make it passable by huge freighters. But in theory, most of the canal is already there in the form of the rivers and Lake Nicaragua. \n\nI just find that fascinating, because it\u2019s so counterintuitive to think that building a navigable canal across Nicaragua would require less dredging than across Panama.",

This particular system, as a crucial avenue for goods to move around the globe, needs to be protected at all costs.  And those costs would simply be passed down to consumers of those goods.  These ecological issues will have a measurable impact on our cost of living and overall economy.  I say let's make the most polluting industries pay for it first.  Cruise ships, large ICE trucks, oil and gas companies, and plastics manufacturers are top of mind, though I'm sure there are other equally worthy candidates for massive tax increases.",

Canada has been pretty good at reusing venues - everything in Vancouver is still in use in one way or another for example. Olympics can be a huge white elephant though - Athens was particularly bad with only half the venues reused, and even then very poorly. The Brazil football world cup ended up with a bunch of massive stadiums built in cities that cannot support their use, and everything was wildly over budget. Not sure what will happen in Qatar, but they cost $10b to build and the entire population of the country can fit inside just one, so things don't add up there - not that they care when they can just throw more money at it.",

If the construction surrounding the olympics hadn't been so corrupt it could've been very different. Contractors were hauling truckloads of concrete to the laurentians to build cottages and charging it as if it was for the stadium. Parc Maisonneuve is awesome as well.",

Short course pools don\u2019t often need stadium setting. Actually, most permanent Olympic size pools are 50m long by 25 meters (or yards) wide, so that if you are competing short course, you can just swim across the width rather than the length. But since this is for short course world championships, it makes sense that they would want the competition pool ideally oriented for spectators. Hence the temporary build.",

The company I worked for would do the Olympic Trials (Omaha Convention Center), as well as school and city installs.  What they are doing to seal the pool is similar to TPO (rubber roof) welding with a PVC membrane reinforced with Kevlar.  You basically use a turbocharged blow dryer (called a Leister) that cooks up to 700c. and lap (or butt) weld a 2\" margin on the edges, test the seam for a seal with a hook, re-weld any portions not welded, then seal 3 times with a liquit PVC sealant.  We used Bostick (kinda like rubber cement) to get it to form/lay on the angle metal for the cantilever base seen before they infill with liner.  That whole grid is welded steel and it \"holds\" the pool together without anchoring into the concrete of the venue.  Some of these pools are pre-sold to municipalities for a discount, they are free-standing if anchored into concrete and can be maounted above ground for permanent install- though Myrtha hates that because you can see that it all eventually leaks like a sieve...\n\nWe had 21 days to build a comp pool (12-16hr days 7 days/week), warm up pool (bigger than the comp pool), surge tanks, get it heated and clean (balanced chemicals).  Then we had 10 days to remove everything.  It takes a lot of people.",

            "comment": "To explain why they need to do this: tens of thousands of people will be attending this meet. There are very few dedicated pools that have enough seating to house that big an audience anywhere in the world. The permanent pools that do have enough seating sit empty for almost their entire lives which is very wasteful and expensive to build and maintain, which is why there are so few of them. Building a temporary pool in an existing, multipurpose facility with sufficient seating is a better idea. First, it increases the number of possible venues dramatically and allows organizers to hold huge meets all over the world. Secondly, wasteful oversized permanent dedicated swimming venues don't have to be built.\n\nThe process of building these temporary pools in existing venues was perfected by Myrtha Pools for the US Olympic Trials in 2008. For big meets, they typically build two temporary pools: a competition venue pool and a practice/warm up pool in another adjacent building. All of the filtration, heating and pipes are modular and can be set up quickly. After the competition, the pools can be moved around easily or even installed permanently elsewhere. Many times, they have a buyer already identified for the pool after the competition. When the meet ends, they disassemble the pool, ship it to its permanent location and reassemble it permanently. This works out well for everyone as the buyer gets a world class competition pool for a relatively good price and the meet organizer makes back most of the money they spent buying the pool. \n\n/huge swimming nerd",

Compared with, say, building an Olympic-sized venue that would probably almost never be used at full capacity after the Olympics, this is a great use of resources.",

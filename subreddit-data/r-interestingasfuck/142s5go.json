The general idea was that they'd be great for patrolling terrain too rough for land vehicles. Dense jungle, swamps etc.\n\nThe conclusion was that the task load is too high for the pilot for it to be practical. It's one thing to fly them up and down on an empty field. But low to the ground navigation in a vehicle with sensitive flight characteristics in difficult terrain just caused a disproportionate number of accidents.\n\nIt's the conclusion the whole flying car idea keeps coming back to as well. It only works if there's no pilot. People can't be trusted with the task so it needs a centralised autopilot network.",

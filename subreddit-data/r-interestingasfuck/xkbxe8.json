Fathers will murder their own daughters for what many people in other parts of the world would consider normal behavior. Brothers will murder sisters for going on a simple date. \n\nI don't think that it being women doing the protesting will matter much in the end - at least there, at home. It will however hit the rest of the world harder and perhaps result in enough outward pressure to help push change. \n\nThis wouldn't be the first time they block the internet, lock down the media, and go in guns blazing on unarmed citizens though. Hopefully that doesn't happen this time though.",

They weakened Internet bandwidth and speed by alot to they point I have to wait 15 seconds or so for a simple google search result and we hearing gun fire shots. Also they pulled the plug on Whatsapp and Instagram an hour ago and we can only access via VPN.\n\nThose assholes at top of the regime will pay for what they did!\n\nEdit: Thank you for all your support and positive comments\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb. I will do my best to keep you guys updated. Unfortunately the regime cut off Mobile data connections in whole Tehran area so people can't share their protest videos as i write this and I'm using home network as now that is the only way I can connect to internet (and I'm not sure if they pull the plug on that as well). The only positive thing I can say now is that people took control of Tajrish and Valiasr neighborhoods here and set the police cars on fire.\n\n\nEdit #2: For everyone willing to help please share NetBlocks reports on Iran's Internet stats to everyone you know including news outlets so everyone can know that they are taking citizens basic Human Rights from them and that means things can get even more uglier since they won't be afraid of killing and arresting people like what they did in 2009.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/netblocks\nPlease retweet or share their posts and mention everyone from journalists to politicians to even your friends because every single awareness is matter to us.",

They have a lot of members that are educated enough to take over some positions temporarily if the IR falls, but they have absolutely no military power or support from any countries, so it's all theoretical at best. They aren't total restorationists, but they are calling for Prince Reza to be considered as a ceremonial monarch position, provided a referendum is held of course. Basically, the Prince wants the same thing, a democracy with a constitutional guarantee that organised religion and the eastern bloc have no chance of taking over. Anyway, that's the closest thing we have to a leader. As for what people want, it's to be able to afford food and housing and education and to know that their kids don't get beaten to death every time some brute on the street decides they look too 'un-Islamic'",

We would not even know his name today if the colonial government had been Stalin's USSR.\n\nThe soviet union fell because the entire government and people had lost faith in communism and while Yeltsin had his faults, murdering his opponents wasn't one of them.\n\nBut this government is the worst kind.

Mormons with their magic underwear, Orthodox Jewish women in wigs and men with side curls and prayer shawls, Catholic nuns in habits, The Amish with beards and bonnets, Buddhist monks and nuns with shaved heads, Hindu Sadhus with untreated, uncut hair and beards, Sikh men with uncut, treated hair, beards and turbans, Rastafari dreads.  Religious headwear and hair cuts are endless and all over the world.  The DIFFERENCE is that it's a choice to be a member of that religion as an adult or to have your child practice it until they can choose.  Most of those religions mentioned don't even fully require those religious fashions.  You can still be a practicing Sikh man if you shave your head and beard and don't wear a turban.  You won't be shunned by the community if you shave your Amish beard.  Nuns rarely wear habits anymore to cover their heads.  None of these examples above are forced by law, only by religious convention, unlike female religious garb in Muslim countries like Iran and Afghanistan",

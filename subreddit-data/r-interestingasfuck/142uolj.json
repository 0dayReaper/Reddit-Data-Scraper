Over a mile up   \nthe road, a Top Fuel dragster is staged and ready to launch down a   \nquarter mile strip as you pass. You have the advantage of a flying   \nstart. You run the Vette hard up through the gears and blast across the   \nstarting line and past the dragster at an honest 200 mph. The 'tree'   \ngoes green for both of you at that moment. The dragster launches and   \nstarts after you. You keep your foot down hard, but you hear an   \nincredibly brutal whine that sears your eardrums and within 3 seconds   \nthe dragster catches and passes you. He beats you to the finish line, a   \nquarter mile away from where you just passed him. Think about it, from a  \n standing start, the dragster had spotted you 200 mph and not only   \ncaught, but nearly blasted you off the road when he passed you within a   \nmere 1320 foot long race course.",

At launch the sidewall collapses and increases the effective numerical ratio of the rear end/drive axle.  Just look at top fuel/funny car setups.  One speed transmission (if you could label it as having a transmission), high drive ratio at launch, then the tires grow to much larger diameter by the midpoint of the run.  Its like an actual CVT that works.",

They\u2019re absorbing some of the energy from the engine so that the car goes forward instead of just spinning the tires. As traction is obtained and speed increases the centrifugal force causes the tires to expand to their proper shape.",

I have always maintained that the hold-back \u201capple\u201d prematurely broke and the F-4 in full burner lurched forward just before the cat fired. The cables fell off and the plane rolled down the deck ways and the shuttle blew the nose gear up into the radome. The plane continued down the deck on it\u2019s nose and ejection occurred just before it went off the angle deck.\"",

The ship's aircraft were flying off to land at NAS Alameda.  A bridle failure caused the F-4s nose gear to collapse just after the catapult fired.  Both the pilot and RIO ejected and landed on the deck but the RIO was killed after being dragged by his parachute down the deck and over the stern into the wake.",

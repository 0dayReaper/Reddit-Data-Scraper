Light years apart?  Centering enough energy to each galaxy its own?  From a single source(big bang)? Gasses  consintrating down with gravity being thrown into nothing with zero friction to form into other materials and create energies and materials and the pattern repeating and repeating with no end to the explosive nature of the universe as we know it.  How?  How is it that every galaxy is a galaxy?  I know there are galaxies that are colliding, but even then...they are still galaxies.  I know the universe isn't all galaxies and I heard the term that we are living in the \"star age\" or \"light age\" of the universe.  I picture a spill,  where things begin to attract in a spinning sequence like water turning into sand where each grain of sand is a galaxy and here we are,  our own piece of sand shooting bullets in slow motion cuz its cool looking",

Turns out, she never used that ceiling fan and our little butts completely forgot it was up there. Until about 2 years later when I was home alone and making a sandwich. Decided to turn on the overhead light but pulled the wrong string. Queue flour shower. Got dinged in the head by a time-hardened waffle disc, too.\n\nGood times.",

For a 100lb round with a 50 meter kill radius and 100 casualty radius on open ground. \n\nThat being said, you could easily I mean easily set up a small piece on an adjoining roof ( take as much elevation out if the equation, we will add it back in with trajectory).\n\nI wanna see how this would go. \n\nStep 1, build high angle trebuchet or launch device with incremental adjustments in 3 key areas. \n\n\n1. Must be able to control propelling energy incrementally.\n\n2. Must be able to control both deflection and elevation.\n\n3. Must be mobile. \n\n\nSo imagine a device we build like magic. ( not hard irl) then you set up a mock target and run data sets IRL and in a simulation. Then you figure out the correct high angle of attack ( spear the pumpkin, not slam against)\n\nBasically the attack angle needs to be high enough to spear it, but low enough you don't get caught by gravity and reach constant rate, obliterating it.\n\nLike a soft lob. \n\nTotally possible and it would be fun to do if I had money for that.",

My thinking is that someone could have free solo\u2019ed up a corner, put a sling over the top of the spire, probably anchored to the sling to free their hands, hooked up a pulley and hauled pumpkin up. Then down climbed. I wouldn\u2019t have touched that plan with a 10\u2019 pole but I was never a good climber. \n\nA free solo wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary. The ascent and descent could have been aided with long slings around the spire. Those would have required an accomplice on each corner to get the sling over the lip and a lot of webbing but each sling could be cut when the climber descended below it. The climber would have been reasonably protected the entire time. It\u2019s not out of the question that the climber could have clipped at each sling and could have been belayed the entire time never risking a significant fall.\n\nEdited to distinguish between options for free solo climbing and climbing with protection.",

That was in a climbing bag where you keep your other stirrups and cleavers.\n\nI've been with these fuckers in practice, he just went up and repelled down... I think I know how he got the cable off.  I actually think he hooked it around to the other side and unhooked it from within the tower.

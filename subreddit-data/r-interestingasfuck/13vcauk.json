Funnily enough, they all, without fail, got canceled in late 2008 mid 2009. Now, why was that? VEVO by youtube got introduced. Now we have a 24/7 365 day a year website that posts endless music videos that you can pick and choose what to watch instead of waiting for your favorite song's video to show up. It made it easier and cheaper to watch music videos, the reality shows that dominate MTV now weren't introduced until the late 2000s early 2010s, Jersey Shore and Teen Mom took up the space that was occupied by TRL and the rest is history. Once sites like Vevo, iTunes, MySpace, LimeWire, and Spotify started popping up, the need for a music channel faded away, and MTV had to adapt to the new world.\n\nWe learned about it in my television history class, that the rise of the internet killed the niche cable channel era G4tv, Bravo, Spike, the funimation channel, NHK, etc. All disappeared due to their niches becoming easier to consume on the internet",

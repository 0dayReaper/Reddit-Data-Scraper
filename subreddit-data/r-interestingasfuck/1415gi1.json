    "postText": "In June 1960, the narrows were changed forever. Robert Southwell in a do-it-yourself job, dynamited Camossung which had plagued his gorge based boathouse for years. Although it took two attempts due to the currents, the result permanently diminished the falls and made the narrows more navigable for pleasure boats. There was mass public outcry from this private action as there were concerns of diminished water levels, increased erosion, destruction of the unique feature and apparently a cracked toilet. The Songhees were also angered as the rock was sacred and believed to have powers and spiritual guidance given to anyone who dove down and clung to it\n\nhttp://wikimapia.org/705815/Tillicum-Narrows-Canal-of-Camosack",

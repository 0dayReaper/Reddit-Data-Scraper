Some beers they put out are bloody awful but it's all in the spirit of fun and Dainton are respected. \nThat said, this wasn't anything to write home about. Seems chatgpt makes pretty boring beer lol",

            "comment": "Me: give me your best IPA beer recipe\n\nChatGPT\n\nCertainly! Here's a recipe for a classic American-style IPA:\n\nIngredients:\n\n    11 lbs (5 kg) Pale malt\n    1 lb (0.45 kg) Crystal 40 malt\n    0.5 lb (0.23 kg) Carapils malt\n    0.5 lb (0.23 kg) Munich malt\n    0.5 lb (0.23 kg) Wheat malt\n    0.25 lb (0.11 kg) Victory malt\n    1 oz (28 g) Columbus hops (bittering)\n    1 oz (28 g) Cascade hops (flavor)\n    2 oz (57 g) Centennial hops (aroma)\n    1 oz (28 g) Cascade hops (dry hop)\n    1 oz (28 g) Centennial hops (dry hop)\n    1 package of American Ale yeast (e.g., Wyeast 1056 or White Labs WLP001)\n    1 tsp Irish moss (clarifying agent)\n    5 oz (142 g) Priming sugar (for bottling)\n\nInstructions:\n\n    Heat 3 gallons (11 liters) of water in a large pot and bring it to a temperature of around 152\u00b0F (67\u00b0C). This will be your mash water.\n\n    Crush all the grains and add them to a mesh bag. Place the bag in the pot of hot water and stir well. Maintain the temperature at 152\u00b0F (67\u00b0C) for 60 minutes to allow the enzymes to convert starches into fermentable sugars.\n\n    After 60 minutes, remove the grain bag and let it drain back into the pot. Rinse the bag with a small amount of hot water to extract any remaining sugars.\n\n    Bring the liquid in the pot (the wort) to a boil. Once boiling, add the Columbus hops and let them boil for 60 minutes.\n\n    After 45 minutes of boiling, add the Irish moss to help clarify the beer.\n\n    After 60 minutes, turn off the heat and add the Cascade hops. Let them steep for 10 minutes.\n\n    Cool the wort rapidly by placing the pot in an ice bath or using a wort chiller until the temperature reaches around 68\u00b0F (20\u00b0C).\n\n    Transfer the cooled wort to a sanitized fermentation vessel (such as a glass carboy or plastic bucket) and pitch the yeast.\n\n    Ferment the beer at a temperature between 65\u00b0F to 70\u00b0F (18\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C) for about a week or until fermentation activity subsides.\n\n    After primary fermentation, add the dry hops (Cascade and Centennial) directly to the fermentation vessel. Let them sit for 5 to 7 days to enhance the aroma.\n\n    When ready to bottle, dissolve the priming sugar in a small amount of boiling water and add it to the beer. Stir gently to ensure even distribution.\n\n    Transfer the beer to sanitized bottles and cap them. Allow the beer to carbonate for approximately 2 weeks at room temperature.\n\n    After the carbonation period, your IPA should be ready to enjoy! Chill the bottles before opening and pour into a glass to fully appreciate the flavors and aromas.\n\nRemember to sanitize all equipment properly throughout the brewing process to prevent contamination. Enjoy your homemade IPA!",

No confusion about how many stops away a destination is. The signage is clear, color coded and very easy to understand for non-natives. \n\nNot only are trains so predictable in timing, if one is late they will give notes to the passengers to give their bosses because it is so rare. Metro stops themselves are underground mini cities, with hundreds of restaurants and shops between each station. Shinjuku station alone has over 3.4 million passengers pass-through it a day and there are over 200 exit points just from that station alone. \n\nThe only thing about Tokyo trains are they get unbelievably busy during rush hours. Literal sardines, your butt will be in someone else's crotch and you just keep getting pushed backwards as more people try to get onto the train. However, eating and talking on public transportation is very heavily discouraged so there's no loud conversations or the smell of someone's dinner on the way home.",

I couldn't live there because I'm from northern Canada and I can't breathe without vast expanses of trees and lakes and solitude, but I lived in Tokyo for a while and it was so *unique.* Climb out of bed and hop on the Metro, and suddenly you're in a glittering shopping district with arcades and malls on the 17th floor. Hop back on and the clubs are jumping where the city never sleeps. Hop back on again and you're at a peaceful temple in a soft green park. Back on the metro one more time, and you'll find yourself among no-nonsense suits in financial district skyrises. It's all so accessible and friendly. Just wonderful.",

On the sidewalk. Or if you see a parking lot, look around the edges. Look between any buildings you see. What's there? Little landscaped traffic islands right? Or a shoulder on the side of the road large enough to park a car, correct? \nIs there enough space between buildings to drive a car between them? \nIf you go to a gas station, does it have a landscaped lawn that surrounds the property? \nDo the houses around you have yards that are theoretically large enough to fit another small house in? \n\nThis is the empty your friend is talking about.\nIn Tokyo, every single square meter is used. Green open spaces are very rare. Landscaping is rare. Every single nook and cranny is used for something. A tobacco stand or lottery ticket booth can fit in the area the size of a closet. An odd strip of land people in the US would consider only good for a parking space would be used for a 3 story house. Some personal car garages are so small, you actually need to put your car in neutral, step out and push it in by hand, because you're gonna be trapped inside otherwise!",

A lot of cities would be in the destruction path of that blast.\n\nAnd millions would have their ears ruptured from the sound.\n\nI always had that lingering sense of impending doom while living on Japan. And I was there for the big quake. First thing I did when evacuated was look to Fuji to make sure the predictions, while many years late, also weren't  fully true.",

It\u2019s the only time in life I\u2019ve ever felt at peace.",

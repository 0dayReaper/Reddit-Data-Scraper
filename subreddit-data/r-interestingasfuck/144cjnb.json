                            "comment": "So I had once moved to a new country and new city where I barely spoke the language, one evening I was talking a walk before planning to head to this party. And I decided to walk through this dark park that I had been at during the day, but heard in passing that  \"pleasant during the day but avoid it by all means after sunset\" well being young and dumb and often a little too recklessly brave for my own good at that age, I decided I'd cut through cause the metro I was planning on catching was on the other side and I thought it'd be easier than going around.\n\nWell I enter into the dark park and about a minute in, I get this feeling like I'm being watched, and about a couple of seconds later I swear I hear whispering, this kind of faint talking from somewhere, and then I look into the bushes to the left of me and I see a bunch of eyeballs in the dark, then I look to the right of me and see more eyeballs behind the trees, looking at me. \n\nWell before I know it the guys from the right side bushes are walking towards me, and I noticed some guys have appeared behind me. So naturally I'm starting to feel a little uneasy here. I hear the men exchange words in some, what I assume is some African language that I don't recognize, but have heard before in the passing. \n\nAnother point, is that I am a trans man. Back then I had not transitioned, but luckily I have always been quite androgynous and I had noticed that when meeting people, especially if they were from non-western backgrounds and especially in the dark, there was a pretty decent chance of them reading me as male, which is why I felt pretty comfortable walking out at night alone in the first place. \n\nWell, I decide to stay calm and not say anything until I figure out what it is they want. After a momemt, one of the guys switches to the local language (which I speak quite poorly at this point) says \"Young man, what are you doing here?\" I again look behind me and wonder if I should start walking the other direction but I'm quite surrounded and get a feeling that I don't want to appear scared at the moment. So the next thing that I hear coming out of my mouth is \"I want to buy weed, are you guys selling?\" thing is, I heard there are dealers in this area and I making myself into a customer who game here intentionally, seemed like a better idea than a lost tourist. The guys pretty much all laughed at this response, and then after a moment the guy goes \"No problem, I sell you some weed young man\" and I see him pull out a tobacco bag and then some weed, another guy to the left of him says something to him and they exchange words in a different language again and then he takes some of the weed and starts rolling a joint, the man who agreed sell to me pulls about 4-5g bag out and says \"you buy this, 100 euros\" and I didn't question it though I know I was getting ripped off, I just quickly take the bag and get cash out of my wallet and hand it to him. His friend is now done rolling the joint and says \"hey you smoke with us\" and lights up the joint and hands it to me. I don't want to but play it cool, I take a few hits and just chill for a moment while they switch to talk in their own language. A moment later, I tell them I have to go as I'm heading to a party, they kind of laugh again and then say \"go ahead\" but point me back out of park the same way I came from. The guys finally step out of the way so I'm not surrounded. As I'm walking away one of the guys runs after me, and says \"you're not from here, but don't come here again at nighttime ok?\" and then kind of fist bumps me and leaves. \n\nAbout two weeks later I hear of a man getting robbed and stabbed badly near the park, and 6 months after that, two women riding bikes through there get forecfully stopped and one of them was sexually assaulted while the other managed to run away. \n\nSo yes, not nearly as bad as facing actual pirates, but that park was absolutely no place to be at night. But I'm glad I managed to keep my wits in that situation.",

I start asking sketchy looking guys on the street if anyone is selling molly.. Well I end up finding one, and he's like, \"Ok, just follow me and let's go up to my apartment.\" I'm like hell yeah. So we walk up, and once I enter, I see a HUGE dude walk out from behind the door. This dude was built like a brick shit house. So me being hammered, I was obvious to any sort of danger. He hands me the drugs, and I look in my wallet. I had like 5 euro. So I say, \"Oh shit, I don't have any money.\" The first dude says, \"Oh no problem, my friend here will escort you downstairs to the ATM. So we walk down. He stands behind me as I take money out. Aanndd then we walk back up, I buy the molly, and that was the end of it. In the morning once I had sobered up, I was like, shit, that really could have gone south in so many ways but I was so oblivious to anything remotely bad happening.",

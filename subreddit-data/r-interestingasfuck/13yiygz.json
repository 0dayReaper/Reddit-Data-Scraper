It also is a regular 4 stroke power cycle, the cycles just overlap somewhat. \n\nBoth engines benefit from having few moving parts, no RPM limit as there are no valves involved. They\u2019re just not great for torque and use a bit of oil as it needs additional lubrication in the chamber itself. \n\nRotaries should have got way more exposure but the main issue was the perceived fuel consumption. A Mazda 13B 1300cc motor would be comparable to a V6, not a small inline 4 like most people would compare. So the fuel consumption was actually quite good compared to a V6 but perception is powerful.",

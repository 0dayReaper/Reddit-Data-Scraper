Every day they are in that program they are not out shoplifting, stealing bikes or breaking into cars to feed their habit. \n\nIf people are refusing housing and voluntary treatment programs then we can\u2019t just allow them to live out on the street like animals. It would be one thing if these were clean, well maintained urban communities with people trying to jobs but these are basically rape and drug use tent cities (which the people that live there will tell you). \n\nHomeless activism has really lost the plot imo. Cities and states are spending millions and billions of taxpayer money on massive programs, you cannot expect the average tax payer to be patient forever. It\u2019s gotten too far out of control and it\u2019s results time.",

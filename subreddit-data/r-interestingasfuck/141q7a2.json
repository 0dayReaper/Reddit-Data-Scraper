I listened to the original not so long ago and it didn\u2019t move me as much as it used to unlike for example Rumours or the first Dire Straits album which to me still sound good every time I hear them. I imagine at the time that Branson would have become an instant millionaire at a time when millions really were something and instead of shoving it all up his nose as is often the case he obviously had the brain and the foresight to see that he could turn those millions into many more.",

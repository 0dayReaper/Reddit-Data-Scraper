That guy loved science so much, he always had really cool explanations for what was happening at the molecular level and would sometimes bring in some awesome demonstrations! He kind of went crazy after getting ill for a couple of years, and ended up dying in a really crazy suicide by cop situation or something like that. Really kinda freaked out the whole city. But he was a really great and brilliant teacher.\n\nAnyway, rest in peace Mr. White. Donate to his family [here](http://www.savewalterwhite.com/).",

One day we were talking about what heaven must be like, and he said that he couldn\u2019t wait to learn all of God\u2019s secrets about creation. I told him that we would just know all of that stuff once we got to heaven.\n\nI can still see the look of profound disappointment\ufffc on his face as he said \u201cWhat fun would that be? We\u2019d have a chance to learn from the Creator exactly how He created the universe and kept it in order\u201d. God and I don\u2019t see eye to eye these days - he\u2019s got a lot of shit to answer for. But I sincerely hope Dr Nelson found his version of heaven.",

The man had so much passion for science and it transferred on to most of his students. \nEvery day we would walk in to class and he would show us some new practical experiment, light some crazy combination of chemicals on fire, or blow stuff up.\n\nThe guy was insanely smart and made learning in an otherwise difficult class so much fun",

If the outside air is cooler than the inside then you'll get some cooling.

Using a lightweight 'tell-tale' (a strip of paper/plastic bag etc.) check for air movement at the top, bottom, and corners of the opening. If the tell-tale points back into the room then recirculation is happening (air getting sucked back in through the opening the fan is blowing out of). Recirculation reduces net air movement so you want to avoid it. Move the fan back a bit and test again. When the tell-tale shows that air is blowing outward at the top, bottom, and corners of the opening you've found the optimal placement of the fan.\n\nThis all assumes that you have a second door/window that can be opened to allow make-up air to be sucked in to the room with the fan. If you don't have a second opening then you're stuck with just recirculating air through the one opening; trying to optimize fan placement won't increase net air flow in that case, in fact it would probably make matters worse.\n\nSource: I live in a south-facing apartment and have perfected the art of fan placement to optimize air flow over many hot summers.",

If there's a gas leak, we would close all of the doors except the one with the fan, then go through room by room, opening a window until it's ventilated.\n\nIn a fire the fan placement is the same, but the hose line goes in to put out the fire, and it's a coordinated dance on when to turn it on, and cut holes in the roof and knock down a ceiling to ventilate the smoke and gas.  Do it too soon, and you'll just feed the fire and possibly turn the situation into a clusterfuck.",

The teacher didn't stick his head in the bag to blow it up in the same way that you don't put the fan in the house to cool it down.  The fan creates a current and air from the outside is pulled in with it.  I've seen this done with drying carpets after a carpet cleaning.  You put the fan outside the room and it causes a much larger flow of air across the carpet to dry it out faster.",

According to Bernoulli's principle, an increase in the speed of fluid (in this case, caused by the current) creates a decrease of pressure, which is what pulls the surrounding air into the bag. As long as the air current is there, the pressure at the bag's opening stays low, so the surrounding air can continue flowing into it.",

In this case the room is the container. So you move some of the air from around the mouth of the bag into the bag and the rest of the air in the room spreads out to equalize the pressure, some of which also makes it into the bag. This continues until there's a pressure equilibrium between the room and the bag.~~\n\n~~EDIT: as /u/TheEpicSurge pointed out, the breath of air in this video isn't moving fast enough for the change in density to matter and therefore the gas doesn't expand, it just moves from high pressure to low pressure. That did cause me to question some things and it turns out that this video is not actually an example of Bernoulli's principle; this is entrainment - the propensity for fluid to be caught up in a separate fluid flow. The sources at the bottom of [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli%27s_principle#Misapplications_of_Bernoulli's_principle_in_common_classroom_demonstrations) of the Bernoulli principle wiki can probably explain it better than I can. Source #60 in particular specifically addresses \"blowing up a large bag in one breath\".~~\n\nEdit 2 electric boogaloo: /u/darekeyed provides a thorough explanation in a reply to this comment.

A free jet can be laminar or turbulent, depending on the Reynolds number of the flow. The Reynolds number is a ratio of inertial forces compared to viscous forces. For a high Reynolds number flow, viscous forces are often neglected and the flow is considered ideal or inviscid. For this particular case, the flow can also be considered incompressible because the air flow speeds from the teacher's mouth are much lower than the speed of sound of air.\n\nBernoulli's Principle simply describes the relationship between speed and static pressure under several assumptions \u2013 the primary assumption being that a fluid or flow is inviscid. The inviscid assumption is very powerful and has a lot of historic value (see potential flow theory), but it does not state anything about conservation of mass or turbulence or how momentum diffuses throughout a fluid flow.\n\nWhile I am sure pressures have a minute impact on this scenario, most mathematical models for free jets invoke the boundary layer assumption that there are no pressure gradients present across the flow field. Turbulent mixing and viscous effects are typically the primary mechanisms for the entrainment of the surrounding air.\n\nFree jets often start off laminar, but turn turbulent a short distance from the orifice they exit, which encourages mixing with surrounding air. Additionally, viscous effects between layers of air result in the diffusion of momentum from the fast-moving core of the jet to the slower surrounding air. This can be perceived as the faster moving air \"giving up\" some of its momentum to the slower or stationary air, which then accelerates to join the rest of the moving air. Momentum is conserved, but this diffusion of momentum results in an increased mass flow rate as the jet \"expands\" in space.\n\n[This PDF](https://cushman.host.dartmouth.edu/books/EFM/chap9.pdf) has a few diagrams showing the conical jet shapes that form due to the diffusion of momentum. It also includes some of the underlying math, but I found the diagrams the most helpful.",

That's the super summarized version at least.\n\nSo I'm guessing since he increased the velocity of the air by blowing the pressure decreased, leading to the surrounding air to want to cause equilibrium and it all fell into the bag.",

Undergraduate fluid mechanics courses typically address the classic flat plate boundary layer problem. Some other shear flows include wake flows or mixing flows. I mention this because the free jet flow is very similar to the flat plate problem, so you might identify some similarities that help with understanding.\n\nUnder the boundary layer approximation, pressures throughout the boundary layer are approximately constant. Free jet models make this approximation as well. I think the big takeaway here is that the mass flow rate increases linearly with distance from the orifice for flows from a round orifice. ANSYS has a a [good pdf](https://courses.ansys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Free-Shear-Flows-Jets-Lesson-5-Handout.pdf) on this that I found today.\n\nThat lead me to think that viscous and/or turbulent effects entraining the surrounding air is the dominating factor compared to pressure differences. However, I think pressure gradients can only help with the air flow here!",

That would imply viscosity plays a role in the flow, and Bernoulli's principle is for inviscid (effectively negligible viscosity) fluids. You could also arrive here if there aren't any shear surfaces in the region where the pressure drop occurs (e.g., water falling from your faucet, or a liquid stream being poured from a measuring cup) at least until other forces (viscoelasticity and surface tension, for example) come into play",

Attach one end of the bag to a one-way valve on the sleeping pad. Then hold the open end of the bag 6-12\" away from your face and blow into the bag. It takes just one or two breaths to inflate it. Then you seal it off at the open end and force all the air into the sleeping pad. It's remarkably efficient.",

I think that\u2019s similar to how wind from storms are generated like from a sudden downpour the rain droplets lower the air pressure behind them as they fall continuously so air has to rush in to fill that space and you get a powerful cold downdraft of wind.",

However if the air inside is hotter than outside, and/or it's very humid and airflow doesn't do much, blowing the air outside might cool the inside off more. In that case you want to have the fan(s) in a couple of windows, and the only other window open on the opposite side (presumably a shaded, cooler area). This creates a crosswind through the whole house that pulls hot air out and replaces it with cooler air.\n\nBut again, it depends on what's needed. I've had to do it before with a two story house when the A/C failed, set up fans in two of the upstairs rooms and cracked the downstairs window to the shaded yard. Worked pretty well in summer. Not as great as A/C, of course...",

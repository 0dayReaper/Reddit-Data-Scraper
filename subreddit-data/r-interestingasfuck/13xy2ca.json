It was in the basement for years and probably hadn\u2019t been used since the 70\u2019s, it looked absolutely insane and I certainly never used it. Haven\u2019t seen that thing in a while so who knows if it\u2019s still in that basement somewhere",

This uses AC (alternating current), whereas batteries produce DC (direct current). \n\nFor those who don't know, DC is used for electroplating one metal onto another in a thin layer from one electrode to another in the direction of the flow of electricity  (e.g. a copper electrode used to cover a steel electrode in copper). It's so simple you can electroplate a quarter with a penny and a 9v battery at home.",

Highly recommend the first 2-3 seasons.",

I think when you don't have expectations for them it just feels like the worse seasons, which sometimes just happens. Kinda like The Office seasons 8 and 9.\n\nThen I learned how season 3 was written as the natural end and I realized how great of a finale it is (or I guess ~could've been~) and it made the last 2 look real bad",

Usually requires you to check in (request to be moved to protective custody, PC, which is 23 hour a day lockdown and total isolation. It's torture basically) but mother fuckers will still swarm anyone who gets their discovery packet hoping the COs forgot to remove the staples (jail, not prison)",

Back in my uni days in an electronics shop, we used to have a lamp cord with two metal spikes soldered to each lead and if you were hungry you'd retrieve a hot dog from the mini fridge (next to the solder paste), symmetrically impale your quarry, and plug in your hot dog for 10-15 seconds. \n\nIt was done when it started to sizzle and you felt the general sense that this wasn't a good idea. Slap that in a bun from the communal bun stash and enjoy your metallic snack.\n\nI miss college.",

Huygens did not have to ability to record videos but it did take [several pictures](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/Huygens%2BProbe) as it descended. The images were colorized, upscaled and some were stitched together to create sort of a slideshow to emulate how it would look like as it descended. This combined with the fact that these images were compressed again to make this GIF make it look really bad.",

A boy misses his astronaut father who often goes to space for periods of three months and is only home for a few days. His mother is no longer attached to her husband for she knows that some day he will not return home. After he returns home one day in August his wife cooks a tasty Thanksgiving meal - due to the rocket man's upcoming three-month absence - and the family spend a memorable evening together. That is the last time mother and son will see him. He dies in outer space, with his rocket having flown into the sun. The son and mother become nocturnal and only leave the house when the sun is not out, as it constantly reminds them of his death.",

For starters, its atmosphere is actually a bit denser and has more surface pressure than Earth. Mars has only &lt;1% of our surface pressure, and is also constantly irradiated by solar wind all the time, while Titan is protected by Saturn's magnetosphere. Astronauts wouldn't have to wear pressure suits, only thermal insulation suits as it's very cold, and an oxygen supply, of course. No other body in the solar system resembles Earth in the way that it has a liquid cycle and liquid bodies on the surface just like we have with water. Combination of low gravity and dense atmosphere would enable us to fly with nothing but muscle power.",

We can barely get through the antarctic ice sheet to view the deep lakes under it. \n\nTo get through Europas ice, we need to invent a new drill system. This drill system will need to carry several kilometers of cable, to feed info back to the surface as it drills and to control the probe from Earth. Then, once through it will need to deal with water pressure beyond the deepest depts of Earth's oceans, and that is just at the surface of the ocean. The ocean on Europa is estimated to be between 60 and 150km deep, while Challenger deep on Earth is about 11km deep. Some think that the best bet for life on Europa is at the planet surface near hydrothermal vents, at the bottom of the ocean. \n\nJust getting between 10 and 150KM of cable to Europa, depending on if we just want through the thinnest ice or deepest ocean, to the moons surface without getting tangled like a pair of headphones in a pocket would be a marvel of engineering. Drilling the ice would probably take a nuclear reactor to melt through. Unspooling the cable would require equipment. Transmission would require power. \n\nAll of this process needs to be automated, with no humans helping out.\n\nAll this is ignoring Jupiter's magnetic fields, and the difficulty of landing on the surface of a moon that has very little atmosphere to help slow down. \n\nThen, there are the ethical considerations. Do we really want our first contact with a potential alien biosphere to be a nuclear reactor meltdown plunging into it? It could be an ecological disaster, even barring Earth pathogens that might hitch a ride.\n\nEuropa is a target for our descendants to consider. We are not there yet.",

Europa is a potential gold mine of scientific data, as well as resources for future bipedal great apes in space. I don't know how our children will handle Europa, but that is definitely a debate we will need to leave to them. Maybe someone who is being born today will live to see some genius method to get a view under the Ice, but I think it is more likely to be their grandchildren.",

Also a doomsday-type weapon, capable of annihilating a planet, should be built into the station to be a deterrent to opposition(Should we encounter any civilizations that are hostile). High magnitude lasers converging to a center point \"super laser\" would be a good choice.

Some kind of wave radiation seems to be the best option in my non-educated mind. A vacuum would also be good to suck up the water.\n\nThe issue with that is the ice would be liquefied when scientists likely would rather have solid cores to examine.",

It has significant quantities of hydrocarbons and might have all sorts of interesting organic chemistry going on all over its surface and in its atmosphere.\n\nDrilling through Europa might not be as straightforward a task as you might assume that it would be anyway, since the ice is so thiccc. It also might not yield any interesting results for all we know. Perhaps a better candidate for that sort of mission might be Enceladus, which is in the Saturnian system. Enceladus has active water/ice volcanoes, so it seems like the subsurface ocean would be easier to access and analyse. A mission could be planned to explore Titan and Enceladus at the same time.",

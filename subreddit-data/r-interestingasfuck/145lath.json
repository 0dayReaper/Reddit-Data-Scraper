Others have both reproductive organs on one individual, but in different places (like the hazel; the catkins are the male flowers, with the female ones small and hidden along the stems) or both combined into a single flower, like a cherry tree.\n\nBut there are also plants with sexual dimorphism to the point that urban designers chose to plant only one gender of tree because they didn't want rotting fruit from the females piling up on the sidewalk. It's pretty fascinating, how plants don't care about our animal notions of gender/sex.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately, due to the destruction of its habitat, overcollecting by plant collectors, and possibly disease, Encephalartos woodii became extinct in the wild around 1916. The last known wild specimen was destroyed during World War I when a tree fell on it. Since then, the species has survived solely through cultivated specimens.\n\nEncephalartos woodii is highly valued among plant enthusiasts and collectors, and its rarity has made it one of the most expensive plants in the world. It is estimated that there are fewer than 100 cultivated specimens in existence today. Many botanical gardens and private collectors have made efforts to preserve and propagate the species to prevent its complete extinction.\n\nEfforts to reintroduce Encephalartos woodii into the wild have been challenging due to its lack of natural reproduction. However, researchers have attempted artificial pollination and have successfully produced a limited number of seedlings. These efforts give hope for the future conservation and potential reintroduction of the species to its native habitat.\n\nOverall, the Encephalartos woodii cycad is a symbol of the vulnerability of plant species to human activities and serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation to protect our natural heritage.",

Discovery: Encephalartos woodii was first discovered in 1895 by John Medley Wood, a British-born botanist and curator of the Durban Botanic Gardens in South Africa. The species was named in his honor.\n\n2. Extinct in the wild: E. woodii is considered extinct in the wild, as all known specimens are found only in cultivation. The only known population was discovered in Ngoye Forest in South Africa, but no new specimens have been discovered in the wild since then.\n\n3. Dioecious species: Encephalartos woodii is a dioecious species, meaning that individual plants are either male or female. Unfortunately, only male specimens of E. woodii have ever been found, making natural reproduction impossible.\n\n4. Ancient lineage: Cycads, including Encephalartos woodii, are among the oldest living seed plants on Earth. They have existed for more than 280 million years, dating back to the early Mesozoic era.\n\n5. Slow growth: E. woodii is a slow-growing plant, taking several decades to reach maturity. It can live for hundreds of years, with some specimens thought to be over 1,000 years old.\n\n6. Threats: The primary threat to Encephalartos woodii is habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion. Additionally, illegal collection for ornamental purposes poses a significant risk to the remaining populations.\n\n7. Conservation efforts: Global conservation organizations, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), have classified E. woodii as critically endangered. Efforts are being made to propagate the species through tissue culture, and cultivated specimens are being grown in botanical gardens around the world to ensure its survival.",

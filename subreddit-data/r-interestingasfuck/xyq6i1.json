I have over 150 hours spent typing on MonkeyType (speed typing website). Im sure there's plenty of people who would look at that and not understand how I could invest that much time into typing. I would also say video games but thats much more common to sink hundreds of hours into than other practical skills for recreation. Everyone has that one thing they can just lock into and never get tired of. I wish I could be that way with art since I've always thought it would be really cool to be good at drawing but alas, I have no artistic skill, creativity or the mentality for it lol.",

The shades, details to make it look 3d, the different light and darkness creating more 3dish, and the reality it brings and can trick you into thinking it's real, the time and effort used to create, the quality of the pencils being used so it doesn't let you think it is of pencil, the reality so much it looks like it is a picture, and the final creation of this art. This isn't just a wow. This is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. I love this art and this artist for sharing. Thank you my dear.",

Photography in general was a part of the push to move art into the more abstract styles we've seen since the late 19th century.    \n\nPeople will always respect something done by a human hand and even more so nowadays.  The average person is so used to not being impressed by contemporary art that when traditional talent is shown, it's all the more impressive.  \n\nThe AI image programs are interesting and people are going to have access to great computer wallpapers but it won't do much to hinder actual human art.  And let's be honest, the people buying actual human art are not the ones who are going to be swayed by AI images.  The market is going to be fine.\n\nAlso, your point about talent in art losing its meaning has been a talking point for a long time now with the rise of abstract styles.",

I personally enjoy abstract art and love the fact that it can express more than what we see in front of us, but I also can understand the point of which it might take away from the talent that art has about it. I remeber in gradeschool one of my art pieces got into a museum for a little while (yes I don't remeber which one this was a long time ago). The piece was abstract art that I made during the time my stick figures were still not great. While I was painting I had no idea to add meaning to it or specific shapes and that's why it won. My teacher chose it for the contest because unlike the rest of the students who were trying to paint specific shapes in an abstract way I was being truly abstract not really thinking about the way I formed things (to a certain extent because I tried to draw an abstract lady bug). If you think about this, my picture won because I put the least amount of effort. I was in the museum and I saw plenty of beautifully detailed paintings and drawings that the other students made, and there was mine. A big blotch of color which stood out and therefore attracted a bit more attention than the rest. Because of this I've always questioned the true talent behind abstract art. This could be a good thing, because it means that beautiful things can come from effortless attempts, or a bad thing, because art can become something that does not require its own talent. Anyway that was my rant and the wall of text is over.",

Also, I dont want to make rash assumptions, but it very much looks like the base sketch was traced, and then they filled in all the values correctly. That is an art on its own, but not something I find impressive. \n\n\nJust wondering if this is in line with your negative opinion of it.

An exuberant young jackass will quickly be taught acceptable behaviour by the older dogs. \n\nLast year we had a puppy that loved to launch itself at our elderly blind dog who literally didn't see it coming. Every time the puppy did this the old dog snapped and barked at it. When she eventually caught the puppy she pinned it. Within a day, the puppy was no longer making the lunging attacks and would gently approach the old dog to engage in play. They played together so sweetly it was super heartwarming. Most dogs seem to instinctively know how to be gentle and tolerant with puppies but also firm about their foolishness. Some dogs really don't like puppies of course so it is important not to force it and monitor carefully. It is really hard as a human to replace the dog-to-dog interaction and reinforcement. I believe it is quite important to socialize puppies both with other puppies and with older dogs.",

All I could hear from the other room was a thud followed by muffled, indignant shihtzu noises. Came around the corner and had a good laugh.

You are absolutely correct, it is very important to socialize puppies with both other puppies and with other dogs.\n\nAs an aside adding to your comment, it is important to socialize puppies with EVERYTHING...people, walks, unexpected situations, cats, strange noises, children, etc etc etc..  While exposing them to these stimuli, it is important they be shown these things in a happy, non-threatening way...thus they understand other dogs, people, cats, these things are normal and not something to freak out about.\n\nThe age from 4-14 weeks is the true learning time for the dog...the things your dog is exposed to during this time dictate the kind of dog your pupper will end up being.   While of course your dog can learn how to act around people or other dogs after this period, these behaviors will not come naturally to the dog unless it has been exposed to those stimuli during this early period.\n\n(For instance : a dog who is not socialized to people during that puppy time will likely end up never completely knowing how to act around people - quite likely becoming violent or scared or uncontrollable around people by default.  This applies to EVERYTHING, not just people.)\n\nSo make sure to get all of your puppies as many helpful happy experiences as you can!\n\nA message from your friendly Dog Professor.",

Apparently I never puked on her floor again, and the rare times I would I would puke in the toilet.\n\nWhich makes me wonder, was I just throwing up for fun as a kid?? I don't remember it at all.",

Something to note before I tell the rest of the story, I was a roudy kid who would hit, kick, and act out. Okay, continuing, I don't know (or remember for that fact) what got into me but my grandma finished feeding me and I just suddenly launched myself and headbutted my grandma right to her gut. At that moment, my father took my hand, smacked it (which made my baby self cry) and said \"no, badly done little man, you just hurt grandma, that's a no go\". As my father told me this, my mother confirmed it and said that the smack to the hand was hard enough to send a good whooping but not hard enough to cause a bruise (perfect, basically) and from that point on my childhood years went with no acting out. I'm pretty sure that tough love straightened me out \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05, so I would tell others that yeah do it when it is necessary at those young ages, but don't over do it.",

I suggested multiple things, we tried putting the leash in the dog food so it had a food smell, nope.   We swapped leashes, nope.    He lived next to a liquor store that I would stop at and buy my dog a .25 Slim Jim.    So we tried to get the dog to walk again, this time my dog got behind his and nipped his heels to force him to move, forced the dog over to the liquor store, I tied my dog up he was with his dog, I went in and got 2 Slim Jims.  My dog got her treat and walked back to his place and the dog followed... That was all it took and the dog loved walks after that. Took my dog knowing the dog didn't want to walk and forcing him.\n\nNever had seen that behavior of nipping before or after.\n\nThey are very smart animals.",

Too many people think that any physical discipline is automatically abuse, but this is a good example of how to use it on a dog. \n\nWhen we had puppies , the mother dog did the same. She very clearly disciplined the more misbehaving puppy more than the calm obedient ones. If a puppy was too loud and caused a drama scene, the mother would punish it by pushing the puppy's back to the ground with her paw or grabbing the nape of the neck with her mouth. Even (socialized) dogs know what levels of noise are acceptable, but we have human owners who let their dogs bark excessively  and don't socialize their dogs at all.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your comments and for being responsible dog owners! \n\nI recently had an argument with somene (who is no longer a friend) about dog discipline. He lets his dog bark all day , believes that disciplining and socializing a dog is \"unnatural\" and believes that if his dog ~~rapes~~ mounts  someone else's dog, or injures someone, he is not responsible at all for the damages because \"that's what dogs do, and it's unnatural to impose human social rules on a dog\". I couldn't continue a friendship with someone who is so ignorant and inconsiderate of fellow humans and doesn't even have the basic intelligence to understand how flawed his appeal to nature arguments are. \n\nIt's good to see that there are dog owners with common sense.\n\nEdit 2: some of you folks are arguing that a dog should be allowed to mount anyone else's dog because \"it's nature\" \n\nIn the argument with my friend, the hypothetical scenario was of a dog owner who owned a prized pedigreed bitch whose heat season got despoiled by an irresponsible owner's male dog off the leash. Now the owner of the female dog has to deal with vet bills and lost income on the highly prized puppies he could have sold had he bred his dog with a purebred pedigree dog. Some puppies fetch for thousands of dollars. The friend said that he shouldn't be held liable for the monetary damages caused by the irresponsible handling of his own dog. Whether you agree with this or not, it is very likely that in a court of law in the US you will be held liable for damages (vet bills) and lost income in such a hypothetical scenario.",

But smacking your dog around is not the way. (I specify because people seem to always want to escalate \"physical\" to \"violent\" no matter which side of the conversation they're on. Whether they think smacking a dog is good corrective behavior *or* because they think literally any physical interaction is abuse.)",

The older dog gets stimulation and exercise which is CRUCIAL to an older dog's continued wellbeing both mentally and physically. The younger dog gets a model to follow and an extension of what they were used to prior to being adopted (being around other dogs). The owner gets an easier go of training the puppy. Everyone wins.",

They just don't learn bite inhibition otherwise. My bottle baby kitten had no litter mates, and he is my angle, but when he is playing he will bite the ever loving shit out of me. I also have another cat, similar situation, that I didn't feel I could rehome because he is such an asshole. On multiple occasions he has come up to me and just bitten the fuck out of me, no reason, he just doesn't understand how to cat. Somehow even though he had a mom, she didn't manage to teach him bite inhibition. And the aforementioned bottle kitten doesn't know cat behaviors, so he couldn't help. \n\nI would always adopt kittens in pairs, and if you don't want 2, then get an adult! Otherwise you are going to risk having pretty extensive behavior issues.",

That dog was the hardest to train because she had almost no human interaction for her first 4 months and was scared of everything and everyone. She was an extremely sweet dog, but she took years to fully socialize with people aside from our family.",

If they're raised outside in a barn or something similar, theyre more likely to begin diving into their working-tendencies and it'll be harder to get them to be a social animal.",

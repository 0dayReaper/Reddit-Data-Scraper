The point is to show that the \u201cwhy would ET use nav lights, therefore it can\u2019t be ET\u201d argument is weak at best and felicitous at most. The argument starts with the premise it is ET, then prescribes a terrestrial phenomenon to disprove itself.  If this is ET, then these are definitely not nav lights, so what could they be? I propose one answer, which I don\u2019t think is too far fetched given that the propulsion is the next most likely thing giving off visible lights.  \n\nAgain I\u2019m not saying this is ET (nor am I saying it\u2019s not) but I will say these don\u2019t look like terrestrial nav lights (at all) so given the ET premise, what is in the realm of possibility. \n\nP.S.

I believe alien lifeforms exist, just that the universe is soooo large it will be a major effort for them to come here, for what purpose. Of course it's possible that we have our understanding of Physics wrong and it isn't that hard to get here, in which case aliens should be much more common and proved by now. It's one or the other for me.",

We most definitely don't understand everything about physics and there quite possibly are aliens out there that do. But think about it like this, to a civilization like that, we'd be nothing more than what monkies are to us. And a violent species of monkey at that. To have something that's so violent towards its own kind for menial things out in space with the weapons of mass destruction that we have, would be catastrophic. I'd like to think they're observing and watching us to see our progress. But will never make contact, kinda like how we leave uncontacted tribes alone.",

Just doesn't make any sense. Saying there is a multiverse with infinite copies of our universe just seems like some grandeur held in hopes that there is something larger at play. There isn't any evidence for this ether, there is the bubble theory but that isn't really credible and it doesn't even state that every bubble universe is exactly the same. \n\nHonestly I think the simulation theory holds up better.",

This young bison would have been eaten by the wolves at some point, simply because it was young and had shown weakness. Nature is survival of the fittest. Leave it alone",

Shit happens like this all the time with no humans there to interfere. This is not the time for your Snow White moment. The body wouldn't have gone to waste anyway.",

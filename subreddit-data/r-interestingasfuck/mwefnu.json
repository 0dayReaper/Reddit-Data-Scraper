Although there's no hard minimum age, it's unlikely that anyone can meet the educational requirements (master's degree in a STEMM field combined with either at least two years professional experience in your field, a doctorate, or 1,000 flying hours as pilot in command of an aircraft) much younger than that. And then there's still multiple years of training before the first flight, so without having checked there probably aren't many that have been to space while still under 30.\n\nThe oldest was John Glenn who made his second trip to space at the age of 77, although politics probably played a big part in that. Although that was an outlier (second oldest was Franklin Story Musgrave at 61), there have been quite a few above 50 in space.",

Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.\n\n&gt;More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have \"lost.\" What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\n&gt;Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in \"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.\"",

I'd venture that a lot of the math, chemistry, and physics credits would overlap as well, so you could probably do two degrees that each take four years in six years or so. As an alternative, you could do one as an undergrad and get a Masters in the other, as depending on your emphasis and experience, there is a lot of crossover between aero and oceanography, especially with regard to fluid flow, circulation, currents, and the like. A Masters is typically two years, so once again, 6 years. The atmosphere is just an ocean of air, after all.",

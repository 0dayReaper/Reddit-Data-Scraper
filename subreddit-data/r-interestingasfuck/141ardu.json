But I barely felt a thing. First day I occasionally would sway when walking as the floor suddenly changed height but I got my sea legs within a few hours. The only problem I had sleeping was theirs a slight rumble, like a deep bass, due to the ships engines.\n\nHowever at the end of the two weeks once I had been back on land for a day I got really bad disembarkment sickness. That\u2019s basically the opposite of seasickness. My body had subconsciously adjusted to the cruise so well it couldn\u2019t handle not swaying all the time lol. Took about 3 days to settle down.\n\nSecond cruise we hit rougher seas and you could definitely feel the ship swaying more then. The water in the pool was rocking back and forth enough to spill over the edges but not so serious that they closed the pool. Sleeping was fun as the bed rocked me to sleep. I was fine but my sister got slight sea sickness.",

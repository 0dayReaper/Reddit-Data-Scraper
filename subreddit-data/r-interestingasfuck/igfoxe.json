A Skylight filter is what is more commonly used to protect a camera lens as it only cuts some UV but to a much less degree so it has minimal effect on images.",

They can help clear up haze on film though, which is very sensitive to UV light.\n\nThe point is, you can save some money by buying a \"protector\" or other optically clear filter (better coatings obviously preferred for glare, etc.) over a \"UV\" filter. UV filters have also historically had coatings that were somewhat difficult to clean, especially compared to straight protective filters.\n\nI'm pretty sure that most companies are still producing UV filters because that's what people are still natrually gravitating toward and they can upcharge for it.\n\nMost people still just call any kind of clear filter a UV filter though, so there's that.",

The riots were started because of police violence, and then the police refused to help the people that needed it most: Koreatown was disproportionately hit by the riots due to past racial tensions and the complete lack of police presence once the riots broke out. They literally blocked off the roads to keep people \"contained\" in the poorer neighborhood, with no help at all for the people inside.\n\nResorting to defending their businesses with guns was an extreme and somewhat questionable measure. But a lot of these people were immigrants protecting their entire livelihoods, many of the looters were armed, and they had no police presence at all to help them. There were massive amounts of damage and looting, including buildings being set on fire, centered in Koreatown because the police essentially sacrificed them for the sake of protecting white neighborhoods instead. The reports vary a lot, but it seems like they only fired warning shots to force potential looters to back down -- they weren't looking for an excuse to kill people.\n\nBuuut in light of more recent protests their history has been co-opted by the white 2a crowd without any actual respect for the context or what these people were actually doing. Their image is being used to justify escalating violence against peaceful protestors, not defending your only livelihood from armed looters. They're lumping the \"roof Koreans\" in with people like the white couple that pointed guns at peaceful protestors for walking past their house on the sidewalk, and acting like these two situations are both equivalent and justified. Ironically, by doing this they're often aligning the roof Koreans with people who support the police that caused the violence and trying to intensify the racial divides that contributed to this event in the first place -- Divides that survivors of the riots in Koreatown have spoken up about, saying minorities need to stand together in situations like this, when the police and the society they live in leaves them both to burn.\n\nThe fact that they were driven to such extremes is a tragedy, not an act of heroism. Their stories should be listened to and understood, but not idolized. And they shouldn't be lumped in with the trigger-happy shitheads \"defending\" their property against peaceful protesters when no one was looting their property and they were never even in any danger.\n\nSources: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots) [2](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/photographers-los-angeles-riots_n_5902c4ffe4b02655f83b5a86) [3](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/us/after-the-riots-of-58-riot-deaths-50-have-been-ruled-homicides.html) [4](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roof-koreans-meme-know-real-story_n_5ee110a1c5b6d5bafa5604f3) [5](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/us/la-riots-korean-americans/index.html)",

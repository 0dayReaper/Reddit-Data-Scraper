Here\u2019s what yad vashem says:\n\n\u201eOften, the Arrow Cross murderers would force their terrified Jewish victims to remove their shoes before shooting them into the Danube. Shoes, after all, were a valuable commodity during World War II. The killers could use them, or trade them on the black market. This, then, is the historical reality behind the monument. Sometimes, though, the victims' shoes were so worn-out and useless, that the militiamen killed the Jews with their shoes still on. And sometimes, the Arrow Cross pulled the shoestrings out of children's shoes, and used them to tie the helpless Jewish victims' hands together before they were shot. Sometimes they used rope instead. The killers faced their victims without mercy; the victims faced the killers without blindfolds. In some cases the Arrow Cross men tied together the hands of two or three Jews \u2013 adults or children. Then they would shoot only one of the people who were tied together. When they did their work properly and positioned their victims at the edge of the water, all three would fall into the Danube, the dead body pulling the still-living victims with it.\u201c\n\nhttps://www.yadvashem.org/articles/general/shoes-on-the-danube-promenade.html",

Henry Ford was a vehement anti semitic and Hitler described him as a major influence.\n\nWe are a country born on racial division, racial prejudice, and racial hatred.  We are a country whose founding generation built an empire atop the scarred backs and forced labor of the men, women and children we bought like cattle at auction and worked like farm animals until their deaths.  And we descend from a people who lived always in the shadow of the fear their slaves would one day rise up and claim the justice that all masters know deep in their hearts that they deserve.\n\nAnd because we refuse to confront that reality, because we have so many people living deep in a self-enforced delusion of denial and deflection, we have never moved past our collective history.  And we never will, until we summon the collective courage to embrace reality and look at ourselves and our past in all it's glory and it's horror, and accept that both are true equally and simultaneously.\n\nWe can celebrate that which was noble about America's founding while also recognizing, addressing, and attempting to rectify that which is bad.  And this is something that the rabidly ignorant fail to understand.\n\nWe do a terrible dishonor to our ancestors by ignoring the reality of their existence.\n\nWe only inherit the sins of our fathers when we refuse to *accept* those sins *happened*.  When we fail to look with honesty into the eyes of those wronged by our father and embrace them, and share their pain with them, and seek a better justice together with them in the future.  \n\nWe are only haunted by the ghosts of our past ehen we refuse to let the ghosts of the past rest peacefully because we refuse to acknowledge their truths and give their memories the justice that we would want in their place.  This is what shreds our society apart on a daily basis.  Not our acknowledgement of tragedy, but our denial of it.\n\nThe founding fathers, for all their faults, wanted to enshrine a country in which *change* was inherent to the structure of the thing.  The abolitionists among them fought for, and yearned for, the day when the public would be enlightened enough to end slavery.\n\nIn short, they wanted us to always strive to be better.\n\nAny fool who bans textbooks that accurately depict our own history are moral cowards, and failures in the eyes of the founders of this nation, who wanted those that came after them to be better, nobler, kinder, and stronger.\n\nThese fools are just sad middling simpletons, chasing after a past that only exists in the their own trembling fantasies they use to hide from a reality they are too weak to confront.\n\nReality is.  It is, and always was.  You can live in a delusion, if you so choose, but in that delusion the worst natures of mankind will steer you into the same calamities that a ln honest and courageous understanding of the past could help you avoid.",

It talks about the parallels between how Nazis viewed the Jews and how the US viewed the African American population.

Ford bound the articles into four volumes titled \"The International Jew,\" and distributed half a million copies to his vast network of dealerships and subscribers. The rhetoric was not unusual for its content, as much as its scope. As one of the most famous men in America, Henry Ford legitimized ideas that otherwise may have been given little authority. Hitler was inspired by Henry Fords writing. Ford ended up being awarded the Grand Cross of the German Eagle by the Nazi regime in 1938.",

I was so afraid I wanted to get far away.  Two things about Auschwitz that will always stay with me. The first is the sheer size of the place. I think many people believe it was the size of a few football fields.  No, it had to have been the size of a massive international airport like LAX.  And the second was this one wall. A concrete slab, stained brown with blood aged for 70 years.  So many people had been put against that wall and shot dead that their blood had soaked the entire wall, deep into the concrete.",

I read a book called \"Ordinary Men\" about a Nazi regiment composed basically of average everyday working man German guys who slowly but surely became vicious murderers over the course of the war. They did not want to kill the helpless Jews at first. They would march them into the woods, order them to lay down, and shoot once in the head. They would do this for hours. Eventually some of the soldiers, when ordered to fire, would purposefully miss because they just couldn't keep doing it. But eventually this changed. Week after week of relentless killing continued until they eventually started joking about it. Making sick games out of it. It became normal. It became funny to them when an old woman couldn't get out of bed to march into the woods with them, so they simply lit her on fire. They would roar with laughter when that story was told. They were just ordinary men. This is what happens when you don't stand against injustice. This is what happens when you allow evil to become normal. May it NEVER happen again, and may every fucking Nazi fear the night.",

Those men didn\u2019t talk about not wanting to kill Jews, or about any moral qualms they may have had.

In some cases the Arrow Cross men tied together the hands of two or three Jews \u2013 adults or children. Then they would shoot only one of the people who were tied together. When they did their work properly and positioned their victims at the edge of the water, all three would fall into the Danube, the dead body pulling the still-living victims with it. All the bodies, tied together by shoelaces or rope or fate, would either sink or float away down the river. If the militiamen noticed that Jews were still alive, they used them for target practice. However, most of the Jews \u2013 especially the children \u2013 died immediately because the water was freezing cold.\u201d",

I visited the synagogue on the same day and learned about other Arrow Cross atrocities. One thing that I found especially sad was that most of this occurred when the war was almost over. The end was near and they knew it and wanted to slash and burn and murder as much as they could until they couldn\u2019t. It was just over a course of months in 1944. Not for the duration of the war. Such a horrifying time. It wasn\u2019t that long ago either. My parents were alive. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re heading closer to this kind of madness. I lose sleep over it.",

For example, it used to be illegal throughout Europe to be a banker if you were Christian, and illegal for Jews to be in any number of other industries. So they were *pushed* into the banking role. But then, that made them a great way to finance wars. You'd just borrow a bunch of money from Jewish banks, intentionally foment ill-will towards Jewish people, and then expel them from your lands so you didn't have to pay the loans back. This happened *so* many times throughout history. \n\nLaws were also used and designed to keep Jews as an antagonistic element to the rest of society. Rulers love a scapegoat and an underclass. It helps keep everyone else in line, and keeps the populace divided so they can be easily controlled. See also black people in the US. The rulers themselves don't have to believe any of it, but they absolutely will wedge populations apart and intensify hatreds for political reasons.",

The far-righters dipped from the party and made the party Mi Haz\u00e1nk wich is the current far-right party in Hungary. The thing about them is that they are controversial in everything: they were anti-vaccine, they are now on the side of the Russians (a far-right party, what a joke) etc.\n\nIn my experience antisemitism were much more articulated around 2012 then now (helps that lot of young dudes who were brainwashed by Jobbik grew up and gathered some sense).\nToday the trending thing is xenophobia and anti-LGBTQ views thanks to our one and only prime minister and his party.",

That\u2019s why there has been the conflicts that we\u2019ve seen over the years. Because we thought we could kick out the locals to make Israel without them having anything to say about it.

It was only after Israel was founded that all the trouble began and yada yada and the main thing to actually blame would be the British, since they did that treaty with Jews and Palestinians. They wanted control over the land but it was too much. Furthermore, those 8 million Jews you've mentioned, majority of them migrated to Palestine after Israel was founded. There were actually only around 500k Jews living in Palestine before Israel was founded. Furthermore, the definition of anti-Semitism is hatred or prejudice against Jews (the more accepted definition). Now tell me, is Israel a country that ONLY has Jewish inhabitants? If yes, then where did the 1.3 million Muslims (estimated before Israel) disappear to? (Now it's around 1.7 mill). If no, then how can this be anti-Semitism? Anti-zionism is belief against Zionism and Zionism is the belief in a nation of Jewish leadership (ie Israel)",

Now tell me, is Israel a country that ONLY has Jewish inhabitants?\n\nHow else would you describe this hyper focus on Israel? There are currently (according to Wikipedia link will be added in an edit in a moment) around 30 other conflicts that are bigger than Israel Palestine in scale and casualties, but this specific conflict us by far the most reported on one (if we don't count Ukraine and Russia), every one has a general idea of the history of this conflict and which side he is on, but the average person probably can't name a single one of those other conflicts \n\n&gt;If yes, then where did the 1.3 million Muslims (estimated before Israel) disappear to? (Now it's around 1.7 mill).\n\nIn 1948 war, the Arab countries told the Palestinians to leave while the fighting is going on, and come back after Israel us destroyed, Israel wasn't destroyed, and didn't allow the Palestinians to return, and for that here is my sincerest apologies - we are sorry that we didn't let you return to your homes after your attempt to exterminate us failed\n\nThose who didn't flee are the Muslims you are talking about, which are equal citizens in Israel (are Jews equal citizens anywhere in the middle east?) \n\n&gt;If no, then how can this be anti-Semitism? Anti-zionism is belief against Zionism and Zionism is the belief in a nation of Jewish leadership (ie Israel)\n\nIf I say that the French don't deserve a state, and should live at the mercy of other nations, wouldn't make me a racist?",

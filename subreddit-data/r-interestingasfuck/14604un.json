I wanted to see if I could pass by a group once without them seeing me - just for shits and giggles to see how accurate the video games were, and maybe to feel a little like Tomb Raider or Corvo, like a personal challenge. It worked. So now I do it on occasion for fun if I see a group coming the other direction. I just figure if they see me I'll say \"Hey, sorry, taking a piss.\" Like I don't want to scare them or whatever.",

I stumbled upon footage of a leopard fleeing from a troop of agile gibbons few minutes back. And now, my perception of strength has been further reshaped as I witnessed the sheer power exhibited by a silverback gorilla. It appears that, in comparison, humans might be  the feeblest among these remarkable creatures.",

Basically in nature if you're confusing or big enough to not look like a easy meal, most animals will run away from you.  Humans are individually weak, but where we lack in sheer physical abilities we make up for in our cooperation and use of tools to supplement our strength, this is why despite the fact that the average adult gorilla could rip the average human limb from limb, we ended up being the most widespread and successful lineage of great apes.",

Humans are great long distance endurance runners and can keep going at a steady pace long after another animal has exhausted themselves in short sprints. So we basically can hunt animals down to exhaustion.",

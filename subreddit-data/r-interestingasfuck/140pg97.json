Later definitions give other locations, all relatively near this point. It performed meteorological observations from 14 to 26 December 1958. The Pole of Inaccessibility has the world\u2019s coldest year-round average temperature of \u221258.2 \u00b0C (\u221272.8 \u00b0F).\n&gt; \n&gt; It is 878 km (546 mi) from the South Pole, and approximately 600 km (370 mi) from Sovetskaya. The surface elevation is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet). It was reached on 14 December 1958 by an 18-man traversing party of the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition. Its WMO ID is 89550.\n\n* [Pole of Inaccessibility research station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_Inaccessibility_research_station) at the English Wikipedia",

Since you've scanned my profile I'm sure you saw one of my last comments where I mentioned my OIRA (read: Marxist) uncle. I'm also sure you're aware of Sinn F\u00e9in being the PIRAs political wing, the largest party in Northern Ireland (and polling largest in the south) and for the longest time their parties slogan being *A 32 County Socialist Republic* and all. And how their party has quite familial ties to Mandela and the ANC, Castro in Cuba, Maduro in Venezuela, and how dozens back in their paramilitary days had ties to several socialist movements in varying degrees of struggle and power the world over. The PLO in Palestine, FARC in Colombia just off the top of my head but I could go on.",

I'll be going again. The next time will be another few months in the eastern part of the island.\n\nI've probably still got various plane tickets showing inbound and outbound journeys if you really want more receipts - stamps in the passport? Or I can drop a few pics of other journeys with longer hair or beard to show that it's not just a one time wee trip I've done. It's 2:55am here though really so if you want that you'll have to wait until I'm on my laptop again, idc.

First of all, the average thickness of the ice sheet is roughly 2000 meters, and from the pics we can estimate that the increase in the  show is roughly 5meters. So between the two picture there is a total increase of  0.25% which could be a local fluctuation.\n2. Many antarctic areas are considered desert. It is basically too cold to snow. The fact that there have been an increase of snow, easily explain the increase of temperature that lead to an increase of precipitation. It is counterintuitive, yet true. If you want to help your mind, think of a scenario where the temperature get colder and colder. The ice-sheet will not expand in height, yet in area, growing more and more towards nord, and not \"away from the ground\". \n3. We are assuming there where no seismological activity in the area. \n4. This is still an hyper simplified version of the phenomena. We should consider the comprensibility of ice, and other effects, including seasonal variation. \n\nTo back up my argument, have a look at the data for Greenland:  \n[https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/ice-sheet-science](https://nsidc.org/learn/parts-cryosphere/ice-sheets/ice-sheet-science)  \nIt is clear that the average loss of ice is correlated with an increase of ice in the internal part (due to more snowing, due to warmer temperature).",

And thus [snowfall has increased in antartica](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43691671) as the air there has gotten warmer due to global warming. So while there is additional melting from the warming, the additional snowfall is greater, so it accumulates every year.",

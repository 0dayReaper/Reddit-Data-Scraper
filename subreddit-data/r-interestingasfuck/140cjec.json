In a flat stretch of African Savannah or equivalent where humans have dark skin for sun protection then yes we should win against most animals except maybe ostriches (birds in general have some weird anatomy). But in a much colder snowier environment where cooling down is much easier and bipedalism is giving you trouble moving on the terrain, then I\u2019d bet on a wolf. They\u2019re just built for that climate. I know some sled dogs as well have metabolic adaptations to avoid burning glycogen which allows them to \u201crefuel\u201d much faster than humans can as well. Not entirely sure if that applies to wolves as well but you get the idea. It\u2019s not as nice of a statement but \u201cNot many mammals can run as long as we can in their optimal environment\u201d would be more accurate.",

If the Orca wants to come up out of the water and land on top of the whales they need some depth to do that. In deep water they are coming from all sides and below, in shallow water it is just from the sides. Also if there are reefs or something like that can be a barrier to the Orca's attacking from that side etc. At least this is what I think. Both the whale and Orca's can dive so that doesn't help, in fact makes the whales more vulnerable. The Orca's can take turns surfacing for air while others keep the whales deep till they drown.",

Both orcas target the right hand gray (relative to when the whales are facing us) and the left hand gray flips almost in unison with its homie, but didn\u2019t get hit at all.\n\nGrays will also flip on their back and try to raise their calf on their belly to keep it away from predators so the roll over is def one of their strategies. Also you can see the grays swimming on their side with their bellies facing each other which apparently they do as another defensive tactic to prevent the orcas from getting at their guts.",

They usually try to stay closer to the shore line so it is not as deep. The orcas try to separate the calf from the Mom by ramming it and inserting themselves between the Mom and the Calves. Since it is deep the orcas can get up to speed from underneath and really ram the calves and hurt them. If the orcas are successful the calves eventually tire due to exhaustion and internal injuries and drown. The orcas are really no match for the healthy full grown adult gray whale that lead the migration but will go after the Mom and the Calves as they come up behind.",

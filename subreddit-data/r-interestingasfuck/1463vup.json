You basically just point the camera at the nebula, use a bahtinov filter to focus, then dial in exposure and iso, aperture is set to the lowest setting to let more light in(this is why telescopes are better, they have lower aperture than telephoto lenses). Then i just manually tracked the nebula for a couple hours by adjusting the camera every few minutes. Taking pictures the entire time. Then you stack all the photos on top of eachother to reduce the noise in the photo. Then after editing and a total of 1600$ and like 4 hours of work you get this lmao.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/swjfby8\n\nI believe my settings were f6.3, 3 second exposures, and iso 1250.",

I don\u2019t do astrophotography so can\u2019t really offer advice but as there\u2019s still a bit of star movement it suggests to me that maybe 3s is too long, maybe stacking more, shorter photos might get a sharper image. Either that or the tracking isn\u2019t quite perfect. Just a guess though, I still think it\u2019s amazing!",

I was also in a situation that i only had about two hours to shoot between the time the sun set and the nebula set. Buying a star tracker that can rotate the camera so it is pointed at the nebula would allow me to shoot at much lower iso and much much longer exposures, maybe even 3 minutes long.",

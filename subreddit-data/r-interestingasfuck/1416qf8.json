Its hotter than the sun and it instantly vaporizes anything in its radius. Buildings, people, cars, trees, poof -just gone within a fraction of a second. \n\nUpon triggering the bomb this plasma ball will grow to like 2 miles in diameter instantly. This obviously creates an insane overpressure which then heats up and pushes the surrounding air outwards. This is the shockwave. And its what would do the most damage as it basically is wind strong enough to tear apart buildings like they were sandcastles. Except this shockwave would carry debris along with it, sort of large-scale sandblasting the surrounding areas. It\u2019s really bad. \n\nThen of course the radiation. And I\u2019m not even talking about gamma radiation yet, I mean the thermal radiation produced by the detonation and subsequent plasma ball is enough to set you on fire dozens of miles away. So messed up. \n\nThe most disturbing thing to me though has got to be the black rain that follows. Like after the dust has settled and in this scenario millions have already died, all the evaporated water that used to be people, plants and so on, will rise high up into the atmosphere along with the vaporized remains of structures and so on. Thats the mushroom cloud we all know. But up there it\u2019s really quite cold so all that junk cools down and condenses and and forms a black sludge that will soon be raining down. Of course its also highly radioactive because it literally soaked up much of the radiation. \n\nMan nukes are just the worst. Really. We have to get rid of them urgently.",

The suffering and devastation are indescribable, but the artifacts of burned school uniforms worn by children caught in the blast are impossible to forget.  Estimates vary, but approximately 200,000 people are believed to have died in that bombing. The \"Little Boy\" bomb used in that attack had a yield of 15,000 tons (15 kilotons) of TNT. A single, modern thermonuclear weapon can yield 1,200,000 tons (1.2 megatons), or 80 times the destruction of the Hiroshima bomb. To put those numbers into perspective, one 100-kiloton nuclear weapon dropped on New York City could lead to roughly 600,000 fatalities, according to NukeMap.

Both of them died of cancer, and each of their widows got money from a government settlement.\n\nMy paternal grandfather did maintenance and repairs at the uranium-enrichment plants, K-25 and Y-12. My maternal grandfather was a biologist in the Health division. He studied the effects of radiation on mammals. My mom remembers him bringing home rabbits and hamsters and white mice sometimes (not the ones that had been injected with plutonium or uranium, thankfully.) \n\nNot sure how I feel knowing my family was part of all that. I mean, they didn\u2019t invent the bomb, or make the decision to use it, but it still feels\u2026uncomfortable, knowing that my family earned their living working toward the production of weapons of mass destruction.",

I\u2019ve studied the Japanese war front extensively and can say with confidence; the world would be far worse off if Japan had been invaded traditionally instead.\n\nTo give a reference point, America joined the war on December 4th, 1941. It has been about 82 years and 4 wars since then\u2026 our armed forces are still issuing the Purple Hearts made for the invasion of Japan. \n\nA study done for Stimson's staff by William Shockley estimated that invading Japan would cost 1.7\u20134 million American casualties, including 400,000\u2013800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities.\n\nIt was a terrible thing that had to be done to save millions of lives. It doesn\u2019t make it right, nor moral or good. Just the best option to avoid the soviets joining the war in Japan.",

The decision may have been expedient under the circumstances at the time. I think an invasion of Japan would have resulted in many more casualties than were caused by the bomb. Soviet expansion into the Asian theater would have furthered their imperial ambitions, and shifted the post-war balance of powers.  However, the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan was incredibly complex, and I believe, tinged with the pervasive racism of the times. We did kill hundreds-of-thousands of civilian men, women, and children. It's hard to justify those actions, under any humane values-framework. Seeing the results, first-hand, and hearing the testimony of survivors really brought home the horror for me. More people need to have that experience. It ceases to be an abstract, historical event.",

The war was basically over, Stalin was all set to invade Japan and the Japanese were all but crippled. The bomb was a flexing of muscles by the USA. It was an unveiling of the power they'd managed to harness before anyone else, and a warning for others (the Soviets), that America was not to be fucked with. Japanese generals weren't even phased by the dropping of these two bombs. I can't believe this myth still persists.",

This rapid movement of the ground creates shock waves that propagate through the air.\r  \n\r\n\nThey are composed of dust, debris, and gases that are propelled upwards by the force of the explosion which, again, is absolutely insane, I cannot stress that enough.   I feel like I have a pretty good imagination and grasp of energy and stuff but the more I explore the events that unfold within fractions of a second of such a blast, the more I come to understand how limited we are in really grasping such scales. \n\nHad to throw in that last part, cause as much as I hate nukes, they sure are fascinating from a physical perspective.",

The time for touching hearts and minds through peace and love are long gone. \n\nJust look at the protests people have they normally start peaceful until it rubs someone's beliefs the wrong way..said people get pissed the the first rock get thrown and boom they tear each other apart.\n\nViolence is just in our nature and it takes bigger acts of violence to stop the original violence. Yes it sucks but thats unfortunately how most humans are wired. \n\nThat i believe will NEVER change.",

Electrons of the atoms are energised from the atoms/molecules absorbing some of the energy of oxidation and they are promoted to higher orbits around the nucleus.\n\nElectrons orbit atoms in shells (think of a shell as equivalent to a planets orbit around the sun). There are very set energy levels (distances) between each shell, thus when the electron falls from a higher shell to a lower shell, each electron will give off a very specific amount of energy, usually as visible light at a certain frequency, the wavelength/frequency determines the colour. .\n\nThis is why different elements will oxidise and give off different colours - eg sodium produces an orange flame, lithium red and barium green etc.\n\nMind bendingly to me, the reverse is true, and atoms absorb light at those very same wavelengths and energy levels. This you can study the light given off by a star, and by seeing which frequencies of light are not there (quite literally dark lines on the rainbow if you run it through a prism), you can work out which elements are present in the star.\n\nPlasma is a ball of gas, where all the atoms have had all the electrons stripped away, the nucleii and electrons are all swirling around independently of each other in a very energetic soup.",

This sphere is big enough that it's unable to hold criticality, and if it were to reach critically, it would heat up and expand/melt enough to no longer reach it, around this hollow core you have explosives that gets funneled to compress the hollow sphere to the point it reaches criticality and done fast enough that it causes it to release a ton of energy before it has time to stop criticality\n\nThe second stage is a bit more complicated, this stage has a uranium cyclinder filled with Lithium-Deuteride, which is the fusion fuel, with the center being a plutonium core, the first stage generators a ton of neutrons and xrays which causes the Lithium to turn into Tritium (radioactive hydrogen,  Normal hydrogen/Protium consist of 1 proton 1 electron, Deuterium is protium with an added neutron and Tritium is deuterium with another added neutron)\n\nAfter the Lithium turns into tritium, the deuterium and tritium fuse to make helium and release energy as a result, and uses the second fission reaction from the plutonium cylinder to spark the fusion\n\n(This part I'm not too sure about) The third stage, which only some have essentially triggers another fission bomb after the fusion reaction\n\n[Here's a diagram if that helps](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon)\n\nSo thermonuclear bombs can only go off if the explosives detonate, and the explosives are specifically engineered to not detonate easily",

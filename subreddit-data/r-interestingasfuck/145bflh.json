The airport is certainly a highlight though, and has little set pieces for things like space shuttle landings, fires, etc, and the little cars and trucks all drive themselves around and react appropriately, which is cool (and they drive themselves back to chargers in the back room when their batteries get low, then back out into circulation). There's miles of functioning train tracks, historical dioramas mixed in with more \"fun\" stuff, a functioning set of locks for a miniature cruise ship to navigate through, and lots of stuff that's surely been added since I was there nearly a decade ago. There's a reason that like a million people a year visit. We visited kind of on a lark, but I'd have set aside the full day just to do this if I'd known what it was like ahead of time.",

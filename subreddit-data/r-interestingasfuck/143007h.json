You can do both sides for that type of application but you\u2019d be wasting twice as much wood meaning you need to start out with a thick board. \n\nAlso I imagine it might easily stain your feet and clothes if you sit down on the decking. As I understood it this type of treatment is great because it doesn\u2019t need any paint, lacquer or other treatment but I\u2019m not sure how easily it chips or comes off if you brush into it walking past a wall like this.\n\nEdit: after a quick google one (western) source suggests you seal it with tung oil. \n\nThis Japanese site mentions no treatment: https://japanwoodcraftassociation.com/traditions/techniques/yakisugi-shou-sugi-ban/\n\nEdit2: I found a Japanese source that specializes in oils, talking about the treatment side of Yakisugi panels: https://nakamotoforestry.com/how-to-select-oil-prefinish/",

Also known as yakisugi, this ancient Japanese technique produces blackened, charred wood siding that is resistant to the elements, making shou sugi ban wood appropriate for both interior and exterior applications. Charred wood can serve as a fire retardant, since it lacks the oils needed to ignite a flame; this helps shou sugi ban surfaces last for many generations.",

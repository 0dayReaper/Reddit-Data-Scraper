The eggs hatch into microscopic pre-parasitic juveniles which are accidentally ingested by a host when it drinks contaminated water or eats plants or other items that have been exposed to contaminated water. Inside the host, they change into parasitic juveniles, feeding and eventually maturing and emerging (killing the host in the process). If an insect that has recently consumed pre-parasitic juveniles is then eaten by another insect or spider - before the juveniles have advanced to the parasitic stage - they can infect the new host.\n\nConsuming the eggs directly or consuming the older, parasitic juveniles or adults is unlikely to result in infection. \n\nThe pre-parasitic juveniles or larvae are considered the infective stage. It is at this stage that they are adapted to survive being eaten and can infect a new host.",

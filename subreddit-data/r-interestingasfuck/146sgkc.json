They literally carve and shape mountains and valleys. The new ice forms at the top and gravity and the weight slowly push the glacier down the mountain/valley carving rock as it goes. The landscape is constantly changing and moving and shifting. So yes there are deep casms which are called cravasses. Some are small cracks that open into wide caves, others are just wide gaps. They are very dangerous and if you have ever been skiing with a competent instructor or guide they'll tell you quite plainly to not fuck about and don't go off piste without a local guide who knows what the fuck is up. \n\nSo yeah they are super dangerous and i'm sure there are people who are never found.",

Satellites move and hand off to other satellites when they get out of range. From that narrow space, a satellite communicator or phone would be pretty useless.\n\nAvalanche beacons have a range up to 100 meters or so, so unless the person has your location, they aren't much use in a situation like this.",

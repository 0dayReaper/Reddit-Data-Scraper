One day I hanged my trousers to let them dry, took them into the tent afterwards and wondered why rice was falling out of its pockets. I grabbed some of it from my pockets and saw some ants crawling in my hand between a shit load of this rice. I jumped and all of it fell to the ground, with ants hatching before I could find all of it. The tent was full of ants for days.",

After lifting the slabs from my garden, I carefully raked around the areas where these ants were, laid down a sheet of polythene (I wanted to stop the weeds and grass from growing in between the slabs) and then carefully re-placed the slabs back where they were. The ants are hopefully back to enjoying their dark, private world once again.  \n\nThis is also in Ireland for those also wanting to know",

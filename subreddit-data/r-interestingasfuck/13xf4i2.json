Just imagine how much easier it is now with social media and everyone sharing shit against \"the bad\" tribe... Useful idiots all around.\n\n&gt; We in the KGB station in New York did everything we could to stir up trouble for the American side.\n\n&gt; One of our dirty tricks involved a nasty letter-writing campaign against African diplomats at the United Nations \u2013 an idea cooked up by KGB headquarters in Moscow and approved by the Communist Party Central Committee. Our KGB staff, using new typewriters and wearing gloves so as not to leave fingerprints, typed up hundreds of anonymous hate letters and sent them to dozens of African missions. The letters, purportedly from white supremacists as well as average Americans, were filled with virulent racist diatribes. The African diplomats publicized some of the letters as examples of the racism still rampant in America, and members of the American and foreign press corps quoted from them. I and other KGB officers working as correspondents in the United States reported extensively on this rabidly anti-black letter writing campaign. I lost no sleep over these dirty tricks, figuring they were just another weapon in the Cold War.\n\n&gt; **Our active measures campaign did not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, or color: we went after everybody**. Attempting to show that America was inhospitable to Jews, we wrote anti-Semitic letters to American Jewish leaders. My fellow officers paid American agents to paint swastikas on synagogues in New York and Washington. Our New York station even hired people to desecrate Jewish cemeteries. I, of course, beamed back reports of these misdeeds to my listeners in Moscow, who \u2013 tuning in to my broadcasts \u2013 no doubt thanked the Lord or Comrade Lenin that they had been born in a social paradise, and not in a hotbed of racial tension like the United States.",

Getting the lies out fast was more important as corrections are never picked up.\n\nThe elderly lady severely burned by McDonald's drive through coffee is a great example. She was presented as a money grubbing gold digger initially but she won millions from a jury based on the facts. \n\nEarly on the McDonald's media team made it about lawsuit happy consumers looking for a quick buck. \n\nIn this case after several complaints by drive through customers buying coffee from this McDonald's and driving back to their offices finding the coffee had cooled down too much, they cranked the temperature of the coffee machine way up to ensure when local office workers returned to their offices the coffees would still be hot. When the lady was given a cup that was filled up with a lid that wasn't secured, it dumped scalding hot coffee on to her legs severely burning her. \n\nThis has happened to me without the extreme heat. In a drive through there is no where to go. You are buckled into your seat and you can't open the door to escape. You are f*cked. But the public just thinks it's a frivolous lawsuit even decades later. \n\nCorrections don't matter. First to the punch does. No one has time to look deeper especially today as it requires too much work and too much brain power for many. Emotions rule the day.",

The interviewer was trained in journalism with a speciality in communications. Obviously this CIA agent had training in communications as well. But more broadly, professional interviewers would ask professional interviewees excellent questions and get intelligent answers.\n\nNow, most of the content we watch, including \"the news,\" is created by people who don't have a deep understanding of what they are doing.

Putting aside the duty that citizens have to vote and be informed of what their government is doing, there are many reasons to keep an eye on the news cycle.\n\nThe situation is nothing new. Governments have always been aware of the power of propaganda. It's been used since ancient times.  Roman news criers (the praeco) used to read propaganda to the general population in the markets, under the guise of news.  As the news cycle evolved, so did the method by which propaganda was disseminated.\n\nThe methods are still changing. It surprises me how few redditors are pointing out the obvious propaganda machine that is Reddit. How many memes do you suppose are actually propaganda of some sort? Or subreddits that don't even try to disguise their \"alternative truth\".",

They\u2019d have their own agents pretend to be a nut job conspiracy theorist and preach on the street or on the radio or they\u2019d leak the information to actual nut job theorists. It destroyed the credibility of it all. Don\u2019t forget that people have essentially been talking about the NSA since the 60s. There\u2019s always been this conspiracy about \u201cthe government is always listening and are tapped into every phone call..\u201d well all of that turned out to be true after all.",

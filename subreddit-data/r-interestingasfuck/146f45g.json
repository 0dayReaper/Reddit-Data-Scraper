Multiply it by 3meter width which is 3000m2 of solar panels.\n\nOn an average day, 3000m2 of panels can capture 3MWh -10MWh. On a clear, sunny day, this can go up to 20MWh. These numbers may be even better in Australia.\n\nDiesel locomotive that is used for power generation is capable to generate around 3MWh. So the maths is there. This is perfectly feasible for passenger trains as they are more-less empty with little weight to carry - just carrying people inside large empty cabins.\n\nRemove the locomotives (as the electric motors are more efficient at the carriages like at the underground trains or trams) and there is even less weight to carry.\n\nThe size/length here is actually an advantage. I bet there is a simple formula that can calculate the length of the carriage to solar panel size on the roof when it became self-sufficient.",

Assume there is 3000m2 of space and a solar radiance of 1kw per square meter then yes you have 3MW, however solar pannels are not 100% efficient. Assume an efficency of 25% (a pretty high estimate) then the theoretical maximum that the solar panels could generate would be 750kw. That 750kw would only be available for a small part of the day. My understanding is that the Indian pacific consist usually is usually hauled.by a single locomotive that have a tractive power of 3MW however hotel load is supplied by a power car. \nIts a nice idea but it isn't practical.",

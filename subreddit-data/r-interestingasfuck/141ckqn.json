                    "comment": "The Irish Leaving Certificate (Leaving Cert) is the final examination and secondary school graduation qualification in Ireland. It is typically taken by students at the end of their senior cycle in secondary school, usually around the age of 17 or 18.\n\nThe Leaving Cert is administered by the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and is recognized by universities, colleges, and employers in Ireland. It plays a significant role in determining students' future educational and career opportunities.\n\nThe examination consists of two main parts: the written exams and the coursework or practical components. The written exams are usually held in June over a two-week period. Students choose subjects they want to be examined in, typically including a combination of core subjects like English, Irish (Gaeilge), and Mathematics, as well as optional subjects such as sciences, languages, humanities, and business-related subjects.\n\nEach subject is assessed through a combination of written papers and, in some cases, practical exams or coursework. The written exams are usually graded on a scale of A1 (highest) to H7 (lowest), with a range of other grades indicating various levels of achievement. The final grades achieved in the Leaving Cert can be used for college admission applications, with universities and colleges setting specific entry requirements for different courses.\n\nThe Leaving Cert is often considered a challenging and high-pressure examination, as the results can have a significant impact on a student's future. It is important to note that there have been ongoing discussions in Ireland about potential reforms to the Leaving Cert system to provide more flexibility and alternative assessment methods for students. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the traditional format of the Leaving Cert remained in place. (via ChatGPT)",

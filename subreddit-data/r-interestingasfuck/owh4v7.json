Literally hundreds of churches would employ skilled masons only to fluke out on the payment, and being the \"church\" as a institution is was almost always impossible for the workers to get their due.\n\nSo, a **European wide-tradition of making cocks or assess** was adopted. I forget which cathedral, but one of the largest of all in Europe had around 100 cherubs (those baby-angels). Only *all* of them had their groins broken.\n\nReason being, the church thought they were clever in refusing to pay just at the very end, with only the cherubs left to sculpt. So the masons crafted huge cocks for every cherub, I'm talking 20cm cocks on a cherub who's inbetween 40-50cm. So the church had to hire scaffolding and manually hack off the cocks of every cherub.\n\nEDIT: 8+ years of reddit and my highest rated comment is about cocks and asses on baby-statues. Gods bless the internet.",

He says it's so much easier know that he's working in digital and 3D. Sometimes you have to rotate the design and look at it from a weird angle you'll never see in real life to notice the random cocks he's put in the design.",

The cat accessories, the photos, the cat prints stuff my partner owns, and that stupid little flower decorated drinking fountain that we bought for them that I know at least one of them will refuse to drink out of. If an archeologists found just those clues 2000 years from now after the climate change wars destroy most of modern society, do you think they'd think that we worship and not just that we find them cute and hilarious? Are we wrong about how much Egyptian worshipped cats?",

If you're lucky they go between floors too. Great for running cables in places built before fiber optics or networking cable existed. So you know no one else will be looking in there for a few years if ever.",

            "comment": "It\u2019s called holdovers! When storms roll through a bunch of lightning strikes happen and make trees start to smolder and burn from the inside out. The initial rain makes it so they can only burn in a small spot/underground. Once that saturation dries and it gets hot and windy you\u2019ll see tons of spot fires pop up and eventually merge into a complex. This is common and happens all the time on smaller (and bigger) scales\n\nEDIT (This blew up wow) : I was a Wildland Firefighter for 10 years on the West Coast. People talking about \"raking\" the forest are misinformed. Part of the reason why forest fires are so bad today is BECAUSE we did fire suppression for nearly 100 years, and cleared out all the dead flammable material. Forests need to burn, its how they evolved to exist. When you remove the small ground cover fuels forests grow much more dense, and turn into a tinder box as opposed to the smaller weaker trees getting burned up, and the old growth surviving.",

If you're gonna prevent any fires from breaking out (and by all means: do so--it's hardly a bad idea to not let fires happen), then it needs to be paired with forest debris management in the form of controlled burns (I live in Pennsylvania and our state Game Commission does this a lot on land they control) or physical removal.\n\nOf course there's no real money to be made in doing that, though, and so it (like most things that are a good idea for preserving our balance with nature) needs to be funded / mandated / carried out by a government entity.  \"Controlled burns\" and \"forest clean up day\" doesn't get the budget approval that fixing roads does.\n\nETA: [this comment reply](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1440zi4/how_do_recent_fires_in_canada_seemed_to_start_all/jnev64x/) to mine is worth reading, too.

I live at 7K in a thick, mountain forest in California. So it's a little different for me. \n\nWhere I am, and in most every mountain town in CA, controlled burns take place throughout most of the year when snow isn't on the ground. It is funded and it does take place. And they do try and put out fires that are encroaching on people because...yeah. Life and property. It's a priority. And should be. \n\nBut what a lot of people miss with the argument is geography. You just can't get to vast areas of the state in a way that would help stave off a forest fires. It's impossible. The terrain doesn't allow for it. You can't thin and you can't do controlled burns because you can't build roads, which you need to do those things, in certain areas. \n\nAnd the other is that the really destructive fires are crown fires. They move from tree top to tree top. So no amount of forest debris management would make a difference. And in areas prone to fire the plant life regenerates more quickly. Trees only grow so fast but big trees are only part of a forest. Burn areas become potential burn areas pretty quickly. \n\nWe're burning the way we are due to climate change. Drought and insects are driving that train. So while there's a lot of truth in mitigation, unfortunately it's totally conditional. Wildfires are natural. They have to happen. Megafires are a different animal. That's climate change creating fuel.",

In the high deserts of the west we have an extremely invasive grass known as \"Cheat\" which has taken over native grasses and spread to every corner of the west. This grass unlike natural grasses has a very short root system so it grows exceedingly fast, dries out fast, has little erosion prevention, and burns hotter then other grasses. This results in bigger hotter range fires which kill native plan species and further exacerbates the Cheat issue. \n\nOh... tumble weeds, are totally a 100% invasive species to NA and not native at all. So any old western movie you see with a tumble weed rolling down mainstreet isn't historically accurate. The species took off in the early 21st century and also contributes hugely to wildfires in the west.",

But that map looks like it's actually showing quite a large area of land, and it could have taken a while for the fires to become large enough to put out that much smoke and be properly visible - so you wouldn't know of a couple of them had been smouldering for half a day, just waiting for the wind to pick up and conditions to be right.",

They were all determined to have been started by random shit here and there. Things were so hot and dry and windy (and had been for so long) that it didn\u2019t take much.\n\nThese kinds of conditions are now being experienced by much larger areas, extending much farther north, and it\u2019s happening globally.\n\nEdit: As many have said, this was probably lightening strikes. Also super common when conditions are right. Either way, it\u2019s highly unlikely it was caused by Jewish space lasers (not that that will slow down the conspiracy crowd).",

The majority of spring fires are caused by human activity (industry, railways, camping etc). \n\nWhile some of these might be due to lightning, there isn't much in the way of storms in May/early June to cause fires. \n\nThe clustering of a few of these makes me think lighting is the cause, it's just not as common this early to assume lighting. Normally I'd have assumed human activity this early.",

Conditions were primed for forest fires this year and small isolated fires were popping up all over. Once the wind picked up (as you can see in your post) all these fires turned into major wildfires. All seamlessly at the same time.  \n\nThere is absolutely no way to say when each fire started. Just because when it becomes visible from space doesn't warrant the assumption they were all lit at the same time. All they did was grow into major fires at the same time which is natural.",

Start of those intense smoke plumes does not equal the start of the fires, but rather the start of conditions *in the atmosphere* that are conducive to those plumes.",

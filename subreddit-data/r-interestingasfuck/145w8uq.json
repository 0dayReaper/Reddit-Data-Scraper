The lady doesn\u2019t just take off because it is illegal to run your motor in close proximity to the whales, the concern is that they will run into the propellor and get injured.  \n\nThe noise from motors is also extremely stressful for the orcas - it disturbs their ability to ecolocate and communicate; and multiple studies have shown altered behavior when exposed to engine noise, such as a decrease in ability to forage and hunt.",

The leading hypothesis for this behavior is that an orca was injured by a boat and the orca has been enacting revenge - the rest of the pod learned this behavior from this one orca. I don\u2019t think we want to hurt any more orcas and run the risk of instigating another aggressive pod, these are endangered animals.",

This happens all the time in the PNW; seals will even try to hop on paddleboards, for all the good it will do them, to get away from transient orcas (resident orcas only eat salmon). If some animal is urgently trying to get out of the water by jumping on your boat or board, look around for orca.",

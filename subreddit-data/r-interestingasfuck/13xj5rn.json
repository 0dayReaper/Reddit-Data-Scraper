                                    "comment": "Leaf cutters! Here comes another piece of ant trivia:\n\nLeaf cutter species of ants (*Atta* sp. being the most common, but *Acromyrmex* is also pretty fuckin cool looking) survive solely off of a fungus grown in their colonies called *Leucoagaricus Gongylophorus,* or the much easier name (but not really) *Lepiotaceae*. This fungus is cultivated with fresh leaf bits (rose pedals are a favourite source for ant keepers). This fungus `only` grows naturally in leaf cutter nests. Nowhere else in the world can this fungus be found naturally. Here's why:\n\n*Lepiotaceae* is actually consumed by many other micro-organisms, but primarily a fungus called *Escovopsis*, and if ignored, would consume the *Lepiotaceae* faster than it could grow. Leaf cutter ants however play host to a bacteria called *Pseudonocardia*, which actually produces a chemical that `kills` the *Escovopsis*, effectively negating the greatest local threat to the *Lepiotaceae* fungus.\n\nLeaf cutter ants have the coolest fucking symbiotic system in my opinion, as all 3 elements require each other to survive, with zero alternatives for their survival.\n\nTrivia #2:\n\nWhen leaf cutter queens fly, they actually bring a bit of the fungus with them, so when they start their new colony, they have a tiny bit of fungus to seed the beginnings of their agricultural empire.\n\nIt's possible, that `all` *Lepiotaceae* fungus came from the same fungus culture *thousands* or even\n\n&gt;*millions*\n\nof years ago.\n\nEdit: can you tell I like to emphasis words in different ways ;) lmao",

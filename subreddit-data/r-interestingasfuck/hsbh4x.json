We spoke with several manta researchers in Komodo and Raja Ampat who said they keep finding bigger and bigger ones (they are relatively unstudied...it was only in the last few years they even realized that reef mantas and oceanic mantas are two distinct species).\n\nBeen diving with them in Raja Ampta Indonesia, and it's like an airplane coming in over you...totally blocks out the light.  Incredibly curious creatures too (reef mantas more than the oceanics) who will come over and have a look at you.\n\nTruly amazing creatures.  And they're getting absolutely slaughtered for their gills...as people (erroneously) believe they are supposed to be good for your lungs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (probably other Asian \"medicines\" too, but I'm only familiar with TCM from my near decade of living in China).  Yet another way we are killing our oceans.",

Most of the medicines that use tiger this, bear that, shark, manta, whatever, either don't work at all or else do very little for the patients using it. To make matters worse, there are less expensive actual medicines that *have been clinically proven effective* that these jokers shun because they're not TCM.\n\nSo, to summarize: Many, many animals are dying needlessly, with some species pushed to or on the brink of extinction, in order for their parts to be made into ineffective but \"traditional\" medication. \n\nPlease also note the \"parts\" bit. Most of these animals are tossed away after the requisite parts have been harvested. So they're literally wasted in every sense.\u00b9 \n\n\n\u00b9 - Say what you will about our (US) cattle industry, but I don't think there's a part of them left unused. Still doesn't mean it's not/aspects of it aren't cruel, but little of the animals go to waste... not that that makes it better but hopefully you get what I'm saying.\n\nEdit: words for clarification.",

Only large sharks and dolphins, such as the\u00a0tiger shark\u00a0(*Galeocerdo cuvier*), the\u00a0great hammerhead shark\u00a0(*Sphyrna mokarran*), the\u00a0bullshark\u00a0(*Carcharhinus leucas*), the\u00a0false killer whale\u00a0(*Pseudora crassidens*), and the\u00a0killer whale\u00a0(*Orcinus orca*), are capable of preying on the ray. Nonlethal shark bites are very common occurrences, with a vast majority of adult individuals bearing the scars of at least one attack.\n\n\nIt looks so slow moving *(wrong assessment)* and since they're ginormous, I thought nothing other than people could dare to hunt it.. but it turns out ([from Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_oceanic_manta_ray)) the sea predators eat a manta ray as we eat an elephant - one bite at a time..",

It follows the standard form pretty much perfectly, great call to action, has lots of setups and payoffs that are satisfying, great character arcs, well defined acts. It's just great. I wouldn't be surprised if they use it as a teaching tool in film school in years to come if they aren't already.",

There's just enough reluctance to make her feel more realistic before she runs off into the adventure. It's like Luke with Obi Wan at first. He runs back to Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, reluctant to join, but once they're gone, he's all in on the adventure.",

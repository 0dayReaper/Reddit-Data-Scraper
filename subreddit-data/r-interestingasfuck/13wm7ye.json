When space is at a premium is can make sense to have these very clean, very large-capacity communal bins. And it's faster and cheaper than having all those people spread of single-family houses and having the truck stop at every house.\n\nCertainly expensive, but each commune can decide if it's worth spending their tax money on or not.",

It weighs a lot, you will need very fast wind to affect it. I've seen them operating in windy weather and it affects it basically 0. It's not falling off the hook either, there have been no recorded hook failures (yet). The ones we use, the hook locks in place so it can't come off. It prevents homeless people from ravaging through the trash, it prevents animals from getting into the trash. It requires less cleaning, because trash can actually fit in there and people don't let the bags outside when it's full, because it never gets full. The system is automatic, it sends an alert to the garbage collection facility notifying them that the container is nearly full and requires collection. There's a drain at the bottom so when it gets too dirty, they just spray it down with a pressure washer incorporated into the truck.\n\nThe collection usually happens at night to not disturb traffic, however, it literally takes 1 - 2 minutes to empty it. I think most of us are willing to wait a couple of minutes. Or if it's a two way street just go around it.\n\nThere are essentially no Downsides to this approach, apart from the initial investment.\n\nIn most European cities we don't have garbage bins outside of each apartment building / house. We have one per every 3/4 streets or a couple of them if it's a highly populated area. \n\nJust because it's not popular in America doesn't mean it's bad.\n\nPlus, you know what can also fail? A normal garbage truck. \nPeople can set fire to normal bins. People can move normal bins.",

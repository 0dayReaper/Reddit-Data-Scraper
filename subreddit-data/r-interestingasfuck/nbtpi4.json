The ulna is one of the forearm bones, and forearms are pretty close in size to feet.~~  \n  \nReading the full explanation on the Japanese wikipedia page, it's confusing, and my initial comment was incorrect. It began in China as the distance between thumb and forefinger. Over time, the length gradually grew longer. During the Yin dynasty (sometime between the 17th and 10th century BC) they standardized it as the length of 100 grains of black millet laid in a row. Then a few centuries later it began to grow again, splitting into the \"long shaku\" and the \"short shaku\". At some point the long shaku reached Japan and became simply the \"shaku.  \"\n  \nThe bone name is not coincidental, but the unit of distance came first, and the bone was named after it.",

Yasuke defended Nobunaga 'till the end and somehow escaped alive. He then rushed to Nobunaga's son to defend him as well.\n\nIIRC, Mitsuhide was also the one who sent Yasuke back to the Jesuits since he didn't like him\n\n\nBut yeah Nobunaga was a fan of Western stuff, he was one of the first Daimyo who fielded arquebuses copied from the Portuguese (which they called Tanegashima) in massive numbers which proved very lethal. Soon the battlefields of Japan were filled with guns, even proving highly effective vs Koreans and Chinese when they invaded Korea",

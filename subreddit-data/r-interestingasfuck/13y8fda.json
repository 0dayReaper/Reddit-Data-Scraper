The night before, and the night before that she dreamt she was a little girl in the 1800's, leaving her house. She could describe the setting, the town, the clothes she wore. In her dream she turned her head to see a coach led by horses coming up fast, and she woke up. \nShe told her husband about the dream in the morning. They went into town, Butte, Montana. She was describing the town as they went through it, but she was describing it as it was, not how it was in her present time, which was Post-WW2. She was pointing out the stables, where a gas station now stood, things like that. My grandpa was unnerved and didn't know what to think, and even went so far as to accuse my grandmother of having been in this town with another man. That started to change when the house she had described from her dream appeared around the corner, up on the hill just as she had said. She demanded they go investigate.\nThings got stranger from there. When she started asking the townsfolk about the house and the family it was confirmed that a young girl had been struck down and killed by a travelling carriage, and it matched the time period where grandma had her dream. As the story goes, when grandma heard the story being retold with all the similarities to her dream, she fainted. \nGrandma was taken to the hotel they were staying in for the night so she could rest. She rested in bed, and that night she was awoken by what she recalled to me as the most beautiful and scary moment in her life. Her recently deceased mother was standing at the foot of the bed. Grandma said her mother spoke to her, saying she had to leave this place for her own safety, and she loved her. Then she wisped away. Grandma immediately woke grandpa, the two of them grabbed their clothes without even bothering to get out of their nightgowns, and left. \nThey didn't talk about it much, but grandma wrote it all down. I grew up fascinated by the story, despite that she only spoke of it twice while I was with her. When grandma passed I was on a trip with my own family, and even though it was a little bit out of the way I took us on the detour and we went to Butte, Montana. \nI was a little disappointed when I first arrived. It was a pretty little town, despite the catastrophic-sized mining crater nestled up next to it. I found a local history museum, which was closed, but from the sidewalk in front of it I could see the house grandma had told me about, the one she had died in front of as a little girl. \nAs I stood there the door to the museum closed behind me and his ancient fellow stepped out. He didn't introduce himself, ask our name, but started talking about the tragedy that had hit the family that had first moved in that house on the hill, losing a child and all. My wife squeezed my hand so hard my knuckles cracked. We thanked him, and that's when the horses hit me.",

Once they\u2019ve mapped out where everything is located, they\u2019ll throw themselves in the direction of the breast with mouth wide open and get a better latch than they would have if assisted.",

They would have welded all these anchor points specifically for this lift. Its not a particularly big ship, you would not be able to do this with a large vessel. This ship is probably 100m+ long whereas the large LNG ships they build are 300m and the container vessels are even longer. \n\nJust my take on it having previously worked at Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea and drove past this crane regularly.",

It is perfect, and the biggest, most powerful crane, the ideal crane that created all other cranes. What you\u2019re suggesting, that cranes were somehow created by birds, is just heresy. In the old days, they would have drained your hydraulic fluid and rusted you at a stake for suggesting such.",

He and his men transported it south to Toronto where they showed it off to the world. Named \u201cCrane\u201d as a shortened version of Cranial.\n\nAmazing story, you should read about it! :)",

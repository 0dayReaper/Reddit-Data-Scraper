They even wont include onions or garlic in their meals because of their belief.\n\nGoverments can make up for it by separately providing other high protein products like eggs and some states are doing it along with akshaypatra meals for those children who are okay with eating eggs.

Meat spoils easily and it\u2019s very difficult to maintain freshness and quality in such large portions. The main reason why Sikh langars and Indian temple kitchens are so effective in providing for such large numbers of people is because they focus on making good quality vegetarian food, which is way cheaper and fresher. Cooked grains, lentils and spices are the easiest meals to ensure uniform quality throughout, and they are less likely to get contaminated by bacteria or spores or spread any illnesses. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t agree with ISKCON\u2019s beliefs in any way, the meals they provide are nutritionally adequate and filling.",

For some reason I\u2019d do really good at balancing when it was for them.. like we\u2019d have a high protein breakfast like Nosa with some fresh bananas then we\u2019d make little pizzas for lunch and ribs and chicken and steaks for dinners. I wanted to make sure their little brains and bodies got all the nutrients they need so they have every chance available to them growing up. You gotta work with what you got I guess.. I\u2019m not great at much but I can cook well enough for most people. I felt good doing my little part there. I\u2019m sure these people get that too. My point being, it\u2019s positive all around. Kids get a full stomach so they can focus in school and the adults making it can sleep well knowing they are feeding kids who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have eaten. That\u2019s a great thing. If I were a millionaire I\u2019d wanna focus a lot of energy into getting money and a support system to families and pets that need help. I\u2019m trailing off now.. this is a neat post and I\u2019m glad to see stuff like it. Too much hate and politics and war on this stupid site nowadays. So seeing something nice and OC is.. noice.",

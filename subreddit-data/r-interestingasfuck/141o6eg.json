Meaning that the snail will always default to going towards you and killing you no matter the situation while some external variable constantly tells it where you are. Not to mention snails and other mollusks don't really have a brain to comprehend \"torture\". While they do have a central nervous system, their pain reactions are more akin to reflex rather than \"understanding\" that they are being hurt, so I doubt torture would persuade it to stop.",

Want er mogen absoluut geen virussen of ziektes in de plant zitten. En verkeerde planten moeten zo snel mogelijk ruimte maken voor de wel goede exemplaren. \n\nVroeger gebeurde dit met de hand en waren rugklachten gegarandeerd, maar tegenwoordig gaat dit volautomatisch en 24 uur per dag, met een selectierobot. \n\nNee, dit ruimteschip op wielen komt niet uit een willekeurige sciencefictionfilm, dit is de echte toekomst van de tulpenteelt. Door middel van een gps-signaal, een database van het perceel en geavanceerde camera's met AI-technologie kan deze robot ieder plantje beoordelen op virussen. \n\nEnglish translation:\nAs soon as the tulip pokes its head out of the soil, it's being carefully monitored. Because there should be absolutely no viruses or illnesses inside the plant. And sick plants should make room as soon as possible for the desired plants. \n\nPreviously, this work was done by hand and back problems were guaranteed, but nowadays it's done fully automated and 24/7, by a selection robot. \n\nNo, this spaceship on wheels didn't drive out of some sciencefiction movie, this is truly the future of tulip cultivation. Thanks to a gps-signal, advanced cameras and AI-technology, this robot is able to check each plant for viruses.",

I know this one...\n\nSt. Jerome's 4th century Latin Version of the Bible (i.e. The Vulgate) says (translated):\n\n&gt; And when Moses came down from the Mount Sinai, he held the two tablets of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord\n\nSo the convention after that was to depict Moses with horns. Michelangelo was only one in a long line of artists to do this. \n\nIt was only much later that scholars discovered* St. Jerome mis-translated his Hebrew text source, and that the line was originally something like 'his face was *shining*...'\n\n------------------\n* There's some dispute about the translation, but this seems most likely.\n\n--------\n\nEdit: u/sexymagic70 might have proved me wrong below :)",

Surprisingly, horned Moses didn\u2019t appear for over 600 years after St. Jerome\u2019s 4th-century translation. \n\nThe discrepancy between \u2018horned\u2019 and \u2018radiant\u2019 seems to be a conscious choice by Jerome. Horns connoted power all across Ancient Europe/Near-East (see victory stele of Naram-Sin c. 2250 BCE for example). Moses embodied this strength. He was the captain of the Jews. He who speaks to God must be strong, surely. \n\nThat said, Moses was commonly depicted with rays of light (radiance) across medieval and Renaissance Europe too. Horns were rare in the Renaissance and, much like Jerome, Michelangelo was evoking the raw power associated with horns in this depiction of Moses. (He was also subverting contemporary Italian iconography of Moses to show his skill, but that\u2019s another topic.)\n\nSource: Ruth Mellinkoff, the Horned Moses in medieval art and thought, page 138. and many others. I just wrote my thesis on this topic.",

Remind them they're spending six Netflix subs a week on said cholesterol and they may think twice.\n\nI know it's not always possible. Food deserts, some only have a nuke or toaster. But holy hell, cooking at home is so cheap right now if you're actually cooking. Boxed/frozen are relatively expensive, as always. \n\nMay be just my area right now, but pork chops, full ones, are like a dollar a piece right now. Whole chickens are like six bucks.\n\nGo to the market, get a couple potatoes, a bunch of green beans or asparagus for a couple bucks and you'll eat for three days with those chops or chicken.\n\nI market on Sunday afternoon and the guy just gives us stuff because he can't sell before his next shipment. Blanch it, freeze it, do whatever. It's not going bad, he just needs to make room for new product. Three bunches of asparagus, buy one get two, green beans were free, free lemon...\n\nI thank my wife for this culinary life, though she probably thanks me too.\n\nYes, I know this is a Wendy's",

Sometimes you fuck up but even Mike Trout goes 0-4 some days.\n\nDoing it with your wife/hub/so is so much fun. A little music, maybe background Jeopardy (rip Alex), maybe some booze... It's a highlight every day for me.\n\nAnd the food we create, it just fills me up. In a good way. I feel happy. Buying from a shop I just feel bloated and gross. And suddenly poor.",

I forgot to mention how fun it is to cook with someone, especially with someone you care about. Also cooking for someone is just a special joy as well. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I always feel good knowing I gave someone a good meal and a full stomach. Guess I know why my mom always goes all out during the holidays. All this talk is making me miss my time as a ramen chef at my old shop lol. Well, the people and food, not the paycheck. :)",

Pork is still one of the cheaper ones, but where I\u2019m at, it\u2019s anywhere from $3-5 per loin, unless it\u2019s thin cut. Whole chickens are closer to $15. Maybe $10 when I\u2019m really lucky. Vegetables aren\u2019t much better. \n\nI mostly shop at \u201coutlet\u201d shops, and cheap grocery, and there\u2019s no way I could even get my meals that cheap there, let alone anywhere else.\n\nThe farmers markets by me sure as shit aren\u2019t giving food away either.",

Colours were more \"earth tone\" and softer than in ridiculous attempts at rendering them using super-bright paint.\n\nAlso, many statues were only part coloured. For instance a colour analysis of the Prima Porta Augustus shows that his auburn hair and hazelnut eyes were coloured as well as certain details on his armour (which were interestingly red and blue), but his skin was not.",

It originates on the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and inserts in the middle &amp; distal phalanges of the 5th digit. It\u2019s innervated by the deep radial nerve (C7-C8) and it extends the wrist &amp; 5th digit. \n\nThe funny thing abt it is it appears to blend with the extensor digitorum muscle (which is a big muscle with the same origin but it inserts on the middle &amp; distal phalanges of digits 2-4) but it doesn\u2019t actually. So the pinky is is extended alll on its own by the extensor digiti minimi. Which is weird cus the flexor side has the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus which insert on the middle &amp; distal phalanges (respectively) of digits 2-5.\n\nEdit: murdered that exam, thanks for all the luck:)",

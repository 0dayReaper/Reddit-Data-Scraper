In the past, American workers had much greater access to the American market because, you know, we live here. But now that's less true.\n\nReally, it's just the global version of what we've been seeing within America; it used to be that you had to live in Silicon Valley to work for Silicon Valley, but with remote work, that's just less true.\n\nThe book isn't *just* about remote work, that's just an important example. He talks about how other technologies and social developments are doing similar things.",

It used to be true that for most higher income workers they needed to live in, or near, larger cities, or major tech hubs.\n\nRemote working means that workers are now free to live farther from cities, in areas that were typically rural, and distant. This is having a negative effect on urban cores. The benefit to rural areas is somewhat more difficult to track since the economic benefits from remote workers is dispersed over pretty wide areas.",

A lot of people I knew were shocked the uk wouldn\u2019t just let me stay because I\u2019m cool or something and that I had to actually have a REASON to immigrate there.",

Professionals earn a lot more in the US than almost anywhere else so the US is always attractive for professionals. Second americans just aren't people that migrate to other countries due to various factors. They often only speak one language, they're very patriotic compared to other countries, their country is so big that they don't get to see much outside of it and if you're lower middle class or poor you just don't have the option to move abroad and if you're not in that large pool you don't need to migrate because it'd be a downgrade in a lot of cases.\n\nI expect it to stay that way. The situation in western europe is getting worse (insane taxes, high inflation, unaffordable housing) so the US will probably continue to get more migrants from here.",

But we also have to admit that it's *not* about any other country, and that isn't a coincidence. A disproportionate amount of posts on almost every subreddit that isn't specifically non-American are about America.\n\nThe focus on America rubs a lot of people the wrong way. For example here in Australia many people complain about the focus of American politics and events in our media. And fair enough. The thing thing is though, this is really hypocritical by us. Don't get me wrong, I completely see how it is hypocritical, it's *our* media.\n\nSo I'm not saying it's a good reason to hate America at all, but it is the reason, Imo.\n\nWithout delving into the politics (because I don't know them), there's a reason for this disproportionate focus on America. Look at all the biggest non-state owned companies in the world, they are American, and all these countries have massive global influence. So basically 1: ew capitalism 2: america = capitalism 3: american focused media forced on average people around the world. That is a massively oversimplified view but it explains basically why I think many people have a negative opinion on America. (Despite the average American being in no way at fault for any of this.)",

Someone took a little everclear and poured it into the carb on the ski boat.  The thing fired right up.  We all looked at our cups and realized, we were drinking the stuff that started the engine.  Everclear is amazing stuff.",

Was an absolute shit recipe and was horribly impure but hey it didn\u2019t taste bad and we were young enough we could survive the hangover. \n\nBasically just had multiple gallon glass jugs. Filled it with a fuck ton of sugar, frozen 100% juice concentrates (apple and grape) and then put in our yeast. Only thing is we weren\u2019t using alcohol yeast we used bread yeast. However didn\u2019t have any issues out of it. The yeast seemed to last 7 weeks before it stopped doing its thing. Probably wasn\u2019t as strong as cheaper wines but tasted a hell of a lot better and was strong enough everyone who drank it got drunk on a normal amount of wine. \n\nTook maybe 3 dollars worth of shit and would sell it for $50 a gallon. You had to supply the gallon jug because you weren\u2019t getting my glass ones. \n\nThat became too much work so we transitioned to making premade mixed drinks/punches by the gallon or 2 liter. We just refilled the soda and juice bottles with the drinks from the big coolers. Sold those for $50 a gallon as well. I even had a 5 gallon wheeled spigot cooler I\u2019d rent out with it to close friends. Obviously not as nice of profits but a fraction of the work. \n\nAlways wanted to venture in to making moonshine/liquors myself as I\u2019d help friends do it. But it\u2019s a truly dangerous game and getting quality proper equipment isn\u2019t cheap and takes up space I don\u2019t have.",

I get where you\u2019re coming from but you\u2019re missing a few things. \n\nAnyone that is over 21 with any kind of self respect wouldn\u2019t buy that. But broke underage college kids looking to find anything to get them buzzed will. Also not having access to liquor stores means you don\u2019t really know prices. And if your exposure to this stuff is fairly limited $50 for a gallon of wine doesn\u2019t sound too bad. Plus the whole lack of accessibility thing really helped there.\n\nLike I said we didn\u2019t continue with the wine only lasted for about a year until I got a friend who was 21 to start supplying the liquor. I bought the stuff to make the punch through him he just wanted a small cut of profit. I\u2019d also take orders from people and he\u2019d buy it. I\u2019d get the money and always round costs to the upper $10, then keep the difference of actual costs. My buddies rule was he kept the change (back when real dollar menus existed and change could get you places). \n\nOnce I turned 21 I was no longer the middle man and simply sold mixed drinks. I wouldn\u2019t buy specific things unless it was for a friend. \n\nLived off of that, interest from loaning money, and donating plasma for two years. Scholarships covered my dorm and tuition.",

Yes all fermented booze like wine and beer contain methanol but when you distill it the concentration makes you consume a lot more.of it. Hence the danger. Starting with 5 gallons to distill you'll end up needing to toss the first 4 to 6oz that first come off. \n\nMethanol vaporizes first in the process, the first liquid to come out gets discarded. These are the foreshots. Then as the temperature rises the bulk of the ethanol comes in the next 3 stages of temperatures called the head, the heart, and the tail.

A fully mixed distillation (that doesn't separate by phases or leave most of the ethanol sitting in the pot) is no more hazardous than drinking the fermented product. Methanol in water is no safer than straight methanol if the same quantity (of methanol) is consumed.\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1081/clt-200026976](https://doi.org/10.1081/clt-200026976)\n\nOnly 1 out of 48 seized samples of US moonshine contained appreciable levels of methanol. I would suggest this is because US moonshiners aren't using fruits in their fermentation and are fortifying with sugar.\n\n[https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs40064-016-3303-1](https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs40064-016-3303-1)\n\nMost non-US moonshine contaminated with methanol are fruit-derived and bacterial contamination contributed to the majority of methanol production (an economic disadvantage because of lower yields).\n\nIn short, a decent fermentation with either low pectin feed or sugar fortification and yeast dominance won't require any sort of fractionation.",

If you use ingredients with high pectin you'll have methanol, no disagreement there. When distilling you need to remove the first runs from the still, that's the methanol. You keep most of the rest. \n\nIf your mash is 5 gallons with 5oz of methanol total, you're right, the risk is basically none. With distilling and not removing the methanol you now increase the amount of methanol consumed per serving. You wouldn't drink the 5 gallons in the time it would take to ingest a harmful amount. Distilling it and you can easily have a harmful amount in just a few cocktails worth. That's the risk and that's why you need to get rid of it.",

You couldn't drink the 5 gallons with the same amount of methanol but you could easily take down a pint of the distilled spirit! This sign here: %. That's a percent sign. Your mash will be around 10% abv. Distill it and it's now 90% abv. Same amount overall but you can put a lot more into your body a lot quicker.\n\nLike how apple seeds naturally contain a tiny bit of arsenic I think. Swallow a few seeds, you're fine. Get a pile of apples and you couldn't eat them in a way that's quick enough to be harmful. Remove the arsenic and concentrate it. Now you've got poison.",

The biggest methanol risk (in terms of accidentally making it) comes from pectin so using a reputable recipe (where high-pectin fruits are mixed with normal sugar) helps cut down on methanol production.\n\nHaving also done distillations (not of fermented alcohol, officer) one could also look at the temperature of the vapour from the still. If the temperature pegs for a while at around 65C during the early stages before moving up to 78C (depending on atmospheric pressure), that would be an indicator of a high methanol content.\n\nIn moonshine, any and all methanol content comes from the fermentation stage. The distillation only carries a risk of raising it if fractionation occurs, which is avoided by the batching process I mentioned above.",

If you get the stoichiometry (fancy chemistry word meaning you added one part ethanol to three parts oxygen) just right, there is a chance the carboy will explode. I would much rather have plastic shrapnel than glass. If you do try it, I would strongly suggest some type of blast shield so that if it does explode the blast shield directs it away from you.",

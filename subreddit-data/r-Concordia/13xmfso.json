Try to redesign your portfolio, network on LinkedIn (add literally everyone you feel can help you and get in touch with them, trying to know them and not just be here for a reference! ). Try small firms, like smaller than you can even think. There are many small businesses in Montreal emerging, not many students try to apply there or even think of it.",

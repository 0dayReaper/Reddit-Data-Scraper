    "postText": "Hi everyone! I have already applied to the Information Systems Security program (Meng) that requires 3 recommendation letters. 3 of my professors (form previous University) agreed to refer me. two of them filled up the questionnaire sent by Concordia but the other one ditched. I have reminded him many times (even the day before deadline) and every time he assured \"i will do it. don't worry\". but in the end he didn't. i have contacted other professors but they are refusing to write me a letter now claiming they are very busy. i am at my wits end now. i don't know what to do. \n\nConcordia's website states clearly that the reference letters must be academic. can I ask my teachers from higeher Secondary level to refer me? would it even be accepted by Concordia?\n\n[i am not canadian btw. Higher Secondary (11/12th) is called college in my country]",

    "postText": "** I meant the financial aid office is giving me the run around\n\nI will be a full time English MA student taking two courses per semester. I was advised that 6 credits is full time, but told by a financial aid employee that I need to put 9 credits and then another employee told me to declare 11.5 on the AFE application because for thesis option MAs they calculate it differently\u2026. However it\u2019s not even possible to add a decimal and two more digits on the AFE app. I really need a straight answer and no one is giving it to me. \n\nAs of right now I declared 6 credits and that I\u2019m full time. Will this suffice?",

I used to enroll and then drop AFTER the drop deadline if ever I wanted to do less that semester to still get the full time bursary, if you drop before the deadline you will be considered part-time. \nHowever this was Bachelor\u2019s and it might be different for MA. Hope this helps though",

Do you only have 2 courses that are considered 6 credits and  another thing that adds   credits for you to have more or is it only considered 6 credits (you can check this on your unofficial transcript to see how much credit you are taking in that semester). It's 45 credits over 6 terms. Not sure which program you have. Try to contact an advisor or like the student center support.oh and you can't put a decimal in the afe just put the round number they adjust it automatically to the decimal when they do the calculation that's what happened to me when it was 16.5 credits.",

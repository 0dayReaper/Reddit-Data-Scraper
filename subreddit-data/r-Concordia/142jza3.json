            "comment": "The co-op program allows you to complete 3 work terms by the time you graduate, meaning that you'll have one year of relevant work experience under your belt. The jobs that are posted are catered towards Concordia students making it less competitive to secure an internship as you're competing with other Concordia students, instead several universities. It's much more difficult and competitive to apply to internships outside of the school's website, however it is still possible to land one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really enjoy being part of the co-op program. It makes finding an internship much easier, and it's refreshing to be able to take a break from my studies and work for an entire semester!",

For example, for this summer I applied to over 400 jobs, and I did not find a job, so I have summer school. Coop is very strict on certain aspect that you need to follow, and they harass you with mails every week\u2026 it\u2019s just very stressful.",

In addition you get earlier access to registering for classes, GUARANTEEING that in your degree you will complete 3 work terms without any weird gap semesters.\n\nThis said, you could totally just find internships on your own, and choose work terms at your own discretion (if your status in canada permits it -&gt; as an international student coop is a smoother way to go about this, not an issue if you\u2019re Canadian).\n\nIf you think the job bank, guidance, and earlier class registration window are worth ~$1500cad (correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think the fee is around that), then go for it! You can always leave coop if it\u2019s not benefitting you, as you pay the fee in installments over your degree.",

The appartment is not luxurious but it isn't a shit hole either.\nThe location is hard to beat. Literally minutes away from Guy/concorida metro\n\nI pay 390 now but the rent will increase not sure how much yet. My room is the second smallest\n\nThere is a smaller room at a cheaper price.\nAnother slighter bigger than mine that will be a bit more and finally one that is far bigger.\n\nI should know the numbers tomorrow\n\nIf anyone knows of a place for September 1st that needs a roommat or if potentially moving in with me might sound appealing let me know",

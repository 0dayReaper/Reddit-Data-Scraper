    "postText": "Hi!\n\nI'll be taking Elec 251 with this prof in the coming fall. \nDoes anyone have his course outline? I can't seem to find it anywhere online. Or does he give any tests/quizzes during tutorial time?\n\nI'm hoping to skip the tutorial right before the study break to fly somewhere, but if there's going to be a test or quiz then I'll change my flight to a later time/date.\n\nFor context, there's a flight departing in the afternoon, which would require me to skip the tutorial, but it is much cheaper. The flights later at night are around 200-300$ more.\n\nThanks!",

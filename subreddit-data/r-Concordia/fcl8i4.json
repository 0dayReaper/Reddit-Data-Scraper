    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just thought I\u2019d take the time to warn you of a con going on in the library. Today a guy looking very much like a Concordia student approached me and asked me to show him on his phone how he could access his exam schedule from the app. I told him he could only access it online, so he then thanked me and walked away. I\u2019m lucky that I was not concentrating very hard on studying or anything because as he walked away, he grabbed my bag and started walking away with it. I loudly and politely asked him to return my bag so that everyone around could get a look at him before he walked away. So nothing was stolen, but had my attention been elsewhere, he could have walked away with my laptop and wallet. Be sure to mind your possessions in the library, I\u2019d hate for this to happen to you. Let me know if any of you have experienced something similar. Thanks.",

I would deeply appreciate anyone sharing their experiences, knowledge and perhaps any people that could educate and connect me with any initiatives or organizations in the city.\n\nI ideally would like to meet and interact with new people alongside the work. I'm currently learning French so can't communicate much more than the basics in it.",

Even if you don't speak french, places often accept volunteers who aren't fluent in French as they are mostly all bilingual and it can give you a great opportunity to learn :)",

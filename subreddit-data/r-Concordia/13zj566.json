    "postText": "Hey, I have one more semester to go in BComm accountancy. I made a lot of bad decisions+some mental health struggles. And here I am at 2.55 gpa. I\u2019m trying my best to boost it up to 2.8. \nI want to know if there is any chance out there for low gpa accounting students? I did one internship before. I want to later on study for my CPA by coming back to Concordia as an independent student to boost up my gpa+apply for CPA. \nI really appreciate some advice!",

The school allows you to retake two classes that you've already taken the successor two (example: Retaking acco 340 after you've already done 440) with permission from your advisor.\n\nOther than that you can try retaking your high level acco and comm courses and boosting your GPA.\n\nI re-took two courses one semester to boost them up and those two alone shot my GPA up by a total .15 points.\n\nIt's definitely doable if you take your time and do better.",

Which is extremely challenging but not impossible. \n\nWhatever your personal problems are, it's probably best that you try to do whatever you can to get the 2.8 you need for the National CPA program before graduation, including staying longer and retaking classes. Getting stuck with anything Lower will probably permanently ruin any chance of doing your CPA.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\njust trying to figure out how many courses we need for (1st year) ECP.\n\nI know there's:\n\nPHYS 204, 205, MATH 203, 204, 205, CHEM 205.\n\nBut that's 18 credits for the whole year and I need 30 right?\n\nSo 1 or 2 electives per year? From what I understand, we need both Natural Sciences and Humanities/Social Sciences electives for each Sem.\n\nSo a typical first semester would look like:\n\nMATH 203, 204, CHEM 205, and then like ENCS 484 and BIOL 206.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the way, what are interesting electives with a reasonnable workload out there?\n\nThank you for your answers",

            "comment": "Hey! So you need 30 credits in total to complete ECP program and have to take 2 electives from Social Science/Humanities and 2 electives from Nature Science in the first year.\n\nThere is actually no rule/requirement that every semester must have 2 electives. You can have all of the core courses in your first semester and take electives in the second sem. Or, you can do viceversa. (But that is not recommended cz some core courses are prerequisite to some nature science electives).\n\nI would suggest for you to take 1 elective in the first semester and the other 3 in the second sem. That's what I am doing and it would be easier.",

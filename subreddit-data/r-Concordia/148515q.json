Mostly wondering about the quality of the profs and classes. And if there is a good community! Thank you!!",

            "comment": "Just finished a minor in anthropology. Some teachers very knowledgeable but some are locked in tunnel vision, falling into very Marxist mindset beating the drum of revolution while others have decolonial approach, some are just there for the paycheck and some left a very inspiring impression on me. My favorites were Katja Neves' THE GOVERNANCE OF 'NATURE', which was an eye opener, Penelope Pasdermajian's Material culture was also insightful (a feminist approach). I didn't get the chance to get courses dealing with Sensory Studies but I wish I had. (Constance Classen and John Howes) The fieldwork project course spanning two semesters was also fantastic as you choose your own project and get six credits for it. Community engagement with Dr Ikeda is also pretty nice as you get to choose your own way. The secret to success is to contact your teachers in advance, ask for the syllabus in advance and get to know the authors on your free time before the semester starts. That way you get more time to think about the subjects, find other insights that can be valuable and refreshing for your teachers to read instead of dry last minute essays. Good luck and enjoy! Msg me for more insights!",

In terms of writing, aim for quality rather than quantity and make sure you read appropriately so you don\u2019t have to rely on the internet. Also, make sure to use the appropriate citations.",

The class was an easy A for me, it was a lot of essays, but there was no final exam. I\u2019ve only done two semesters in the program, but I really suggest taking a digital culture and sociology through film because they were very interesting classes. I\u2019m very grateful for the program because it is a lot of essay writing so I feel like my essay writing abilities have improved drastically.",

    "postText": "I'm an international student on my second month here in Montreal. Yesterday I got a really bad infection in my ear which includes pain and hearing loss. Does anyone know a fast way to get an ENT? I have had infections before but none like this and specially the hearing loss is worring me. Some ENT doctors have appointments starting October..\n\nFor now I have a private appointment in a clinic that hopefully can direct me quicker to an ENT but not sure if there is a faster way of getting one. Can I just go to medical emergencies? Would my insurance cover it? Any help appreciated!",

So they will visit you and if your situation is Urgent they will give you a paper which you can go to hospital to the emergency room. To be honest the same thing happened to me last month and I had to wait for over 10 hours in the hospital that a Dr visited me! \nAnd yes if you have blue cross insurance just activate it by https://www.concordia.ca/students/international/health-insurance.html",

    "postText": "Today I just graduated after having done my BA and my MA at Concordia (arts &amp; science). 6 years in total. I wanted to quickly reflect on some things for you:\n\n- You can study at any library in Montreal. They have partnerships so you can borrow books from anywhere else (quite literally anywhere in the world) and there's wifi for you at McGill, UdeM, etc. Use that to your advantage.\n\n- The Word, Co-op bookstore, and libgen are your go-to places for second hand cheap books. Don't give in to buying expensive shit at the b(cr)ookstore. \n\n- Concordia has amazing resources if you look into it. There's psychological help (without whom I wouldn't be who I am today), religious help, financial help, etc. Life is hard as fuck, but if you need something chances are you can get help. If it's something physical you need, maybe you can 3d print it at the library (for free).\n\n- MANAGE YOUR TIME. This is hard as fuck to do but so true. TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS AND TA's ABOUT YOUR DEADLINES. I also work as a TA and I can tell you from experience (on both sides), it helps everyone if you take action before the deadline happens. You can ask for extensions, I've learned that professors are usually lenient and understanding of your circumstances. Your TAs will appreciate the respect and notice you give them beforehand. But yeah, manage your time because it's going to save you many troubles. The key to succeeding is really time and organizational skills.\n\n- GET CLASSROOM ACCOMODATIONS. This helps SO MUCH with regards to organizing yourself. If you're having mental health issues or physical disabilities, go to the accomodations office. It will help you so much. Don't let your mental health get in the way of your grades (that was my biggest mistake and challenge).\n\n- TALK TO PEOPLE. Holy molly this community is amazing. People are so freaking nice at this university. Don't be shy. Ask this person about the book they're reading that you also like. Ask them about anything else (but don't ask them to go out, don't be desperate in the middle of the downtown tunnel). \n\n- ENJOY IT. Seriously. For the past few weeks I couldn't understand why it felt like such a damn long time in my BA and now things are happening so quickly. It might feel like an eternity doing your 200 level courses, taking them and re-taking them to boost your GPA (you SHOULD do that by the way). But it's an opportunity for you to make it the best time of your life (although I hate this saying, it's just so sad if your whole time on earth is not your best time as a whole). To have fun and meet new people.\n\nThis university will absorb your worldview and throw back another one at you for when you graduate. You're gonna learn a shitton not just in your classes but outside, as an individual and as a member of a group. You're gonna learn about socio-economic struggles, mental health, etc. You won't be the same at the end, and it's gonna feel magical how you look back and realize you've changed for the better.  Embrace that. \n\nI find that navigating through Concordia with mental health issues is definitely an interesting path to have, if that's your case. This place is an opportunity for you to acknowledge those struggles as components of who you are (not just as X suffering from Y, but as X who is capable and being as such in spite of Y). It's the place to be if you need help (minus the shitty long waitlist to see a shrink there) because it might not help you directly, but it will accidentally help you become a more whole individual in spite of whatever situation you're experiencing.\n\nNow this is for those in English literature and philosophy programs: Take PHIL seminars. Take PHIL-210 and PHIL-235. Avoid PHIL-263 at any cost. Take any class with Rozahegy, Furlani, and Sharma (you'll never regret it). \n\nThanks for the memories and making my life both wholesome and sad in a meaningful way. I'll be around :)",

I went to University to gain a degree and nothing else. I haven't made any real friends and that's exactly the way I wanted it. \n\nProbably because I'm older, married with children and have a career. University for me was a transaction, my money for their knowledge. Unfortunately throughout the years I have had some really dogshit professors. So bad I literally just didn't attend class and taught myself. \n\nMy best year at Concordia? Covid. Not having to drive into Montr\u00e9al to attend class was fantastic. I'm sure I'm in the minority of students who prefer it that way but hey. To each his own. \n\nAnyway, a lot of my fellow classmates asked me how I handled 5 classes on top of a full time job. And I would, like you, say time management is key. That and pure hard work and dedication. Didn't go to any parties, studied every single moment I had available. Day in day out. I slept on average 5 to 6 hours a day for 4 years. \n\nCongratulations on your progress and achievements. I wish you good luck. And thank you for the great write up. I'm sure many will find it useful.",

This turns out to have been one of the best decisions I have ever made.  I ended up acing all the rest of my classes that semester.  I retook this hard course in my 4th year, when I was ready, and aced it as well.  I went on to do a Masters and a PhD.  Now I'm a professor.  \n\nTLDR: there's no shame in dropping a class if you are in over your head.  Use the extra time to do better on your other classes and retake it when you are ready.",

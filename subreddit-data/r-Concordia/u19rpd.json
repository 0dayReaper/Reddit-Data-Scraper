Took me a while to figure it out fully though, too much stuff but then again, let\u2019s not lie, the old one was pretty messy too and looked very out of modern times. \n\nThe more important thing is, I tried to use the new portal and the site was down. So they definitely retained the main feature :3",

Everything was in a single page and everything fit in the screen at once.\n\nThe new one is a perfect example of form over function. Terrible UX. It's so easy to get lost in it, and it's not because it's new. It's because everything is so spread apart with massive amounts of spaced used by useless images and whitespace. \n\nThe number of clicks to reach what we want increased from two to three. In addition, links are nested in multiple page levels. There is no way to view all links at once. \n\nI'm sure that students will get used to it, but it still doesn't change that it's terrible UX for new users. It was much easier to understand the old portal as a new user.",

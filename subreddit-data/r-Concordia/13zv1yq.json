I only really want to pay the 100$ application fee for residence if I actually have a shot at getting a room. I'm a new student from out of province so residence is a fairly big deal. Thanks for any help",

If I get a decent room (i applied late tho so idk about this) then I\u2019ll take it. But if I don\u2019t, then it was worth a shot. I\u2019ll just look for off campus housing and save so much more money.",

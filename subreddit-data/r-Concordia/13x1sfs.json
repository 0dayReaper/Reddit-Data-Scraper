    "postText": "Hi! I am graduating spring 2023. I missed the only one email the school sent about spring convocation a while ago. I don't know what happened, in my head i thought i did register after. Even if the deadline to register is 5th of june its already sold out! I was waiting to receive all my grades from winter semester and got them all only last week. I really want to go! Worked so hard for the past 5 years and I don't want to miss the moment I was dreaming about... \n\nWhat can I do? Is there is someone who has extra tickets? I don't know how it works but I am willing to pay. I know they have limited spots but I am ACTUALLY the graduating student, there must be something that can be done. \n\nThank you for your help in advance!",

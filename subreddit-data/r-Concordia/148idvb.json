However, we'd need more information like when you applied, if you're local or international, which program you applied to, graduate or undergraduate, what Semester you're hoping to start, etc. if you want more specific information.   \n\n\nFor my own case, I applied to a humanities program for Winter admission in October and got acceptance in November (only like three weeks for them to get back to me). I imagine Winter admissions are less so they are quicker to get through.",

So in my very rough estimate, you may hear back as early as July.",

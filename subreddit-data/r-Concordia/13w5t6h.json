    "postText": "Hey all, i will be taking ENCS 282 in Summer II 2023. I was just wondering how the class is as a whole ? Is it doable with minimal work ? Or will it suck all my time away?   \n\n\nTo note, I will be taking Phys 205 along with it - I will also be working 3 days a week.  \n\n\nThanks!",

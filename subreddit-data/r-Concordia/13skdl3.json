    "postText": "Hi everyone! I'm considering doing a student exchange in a year or two and was wondering if anyone is willing to contact me about what the process is like/what I need to be careful with! I'm still looking at universities to go to/looking at if Concordia offers any help with paperwork, so I'm very much in the beginning stage of all this! **Edit just because it was unclear**: I am a current Concordia student looking to do a student exchange abroad.\n\nIf anyone is willing to message me, especially someone with experience in the matter, please do! \n\nThank you,",

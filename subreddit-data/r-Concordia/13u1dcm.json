I followed  Stanford and and MIT playlists for some of my classes and they teach from similar books, the material is near identical. It's an undergrad, you're not gonna learn ground breaking stuff or build a ML model from scratch. You just learn the basics of classical CS which is pretty universal. Graduate studies is a different story though, go to a school that leads in the research topic you wanna focus on.",

When switching from JSMB to eng, I had to go to the 2nd floor w/ Sal and the others. They were so deadpanned and shit that it cost me a year of my life, since they didn't tell me the right information (that I should re-take certain classes to overwrite grades and take up courses in the program I want to switch to). They are fucks.",

The way some students talk to them makes me kind of understand why they're so bitter. I've heard them get yelled at, spoken to rudely, or just have to deal with a student who doesn't want to accept a non-negotiable policy, or sometimes students who want the advisors to fill out forms for them and hand-hold them through a process. It doesn't excuse them from being rude, but I kinda understand what brought them to that point. Maybe they need to hire more advisors and distribute the workload, and put guidelines in place for how to handle overly irate students.",

I was a desk worker at my old job and once enough people wear you down it is really hard to give complete energy to a stranger after 70% of other clients have been jerks to you. It\u2019s always so refreshing when you get a pleasant and polite client! We remember them! Always be pleasant and polite even if they seem worn out.",

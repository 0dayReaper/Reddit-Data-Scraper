    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI am a recent Concordia graduate with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I was thinking about going back to school but I am undecided between the Grad. Cert. vs. an M.Eng, and was hoping for some help. What's the difference between them?\n\nA worry I have is, I only have 1-2 \"acadmeic\" reference letters so I'm not sure I would meet the criteria of 3 letters. Any advise about the programs or thoughts you have would be helpful!\n\nThanks!!",

    "postText": "I have shortlisted these two among countless ss/humanities electives. I want to choose one for the Winter 2024 semester. (I'm an incoming student in Comp Eng)\n\nPHIL 210 is Critical Thinking (online course)\n\nGEOG 204 is Global Environmental Issues\n\nI want to choose the one that is fun but not too extensive, bcz I am already taking a heavy load of courses. Can't make the final decision by myself smh, both seems good. \n\nHELP ME CHOOSE ~",

You have to study for it though. The material is not hard, but you have to take the time and read the textbook.",

Direct action should be avoided (ie taking off a mask on campus). Indirect action in the form of protests and petitions is definitely the best way to modify status quo to better represent the will of their students. CU doesn\u2019t HAVE to change anything that government does not mandate.",

They can afford to open up because they have both passed the wave and (most likely) dealt with them better than we did. Which is why your first point doesn't make as much sense as you think it does.\n\n2 - Even if that was the case, letting covid run wild would mean that the hospitals would be overflowing with people in need of covid treatment. Not only would this mean that most people with more severe cases of covid would be turned away, but most people with *other* medical emergencies would also be turned away to suffer and potentially die. This is just not the way to effectively handle a pandemic.\n\nWe also had more cases in Christmas 2021 than Christmas 2020, because omicron was way more infectious, even for people who are vaccinated. The vaccine still worked at keeping them out of the hospital, it was just less effective at preventing us from catching it if we didn't have a 3rd dose. This is because the vaccine wasn't made for this specific strain of the virus, so it was less effective for that reason.\n\n3 - We did have mass vaccinations before and the fact you don't know that is troubling. Kids always needed to get vaccinated for tons of stuff and we *do* keep records of those. The reason why we have vaccine passports *right now* is simply because a pandemic is not a normal situation to be in. Once this situation becomes *en*demic, I expect vaccine passports to either slowly fade away be a more general thing for all vaccines needed to live safely in society.",

So, we Concordians can't study at theirs.\n\nSome say they find Webster library to be more conveniently located. I don't know what the consensus is among McGill students.\n\nIf I am in a room by myself, I take my mask off. But as soon as another person enters the room, I put it back on. \n\nBecause the rules of the space require masking, that is what individuals expect and the level of risk they have consented to when they enter  the space. It is not my wish to expose someone to a level of risk they have not consented to.\n\nPersonally, I don't take a huge issue with people removing their masks while socially distanced *and working silently.* But for some people it could cause anxiety.",

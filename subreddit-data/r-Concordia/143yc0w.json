Let yourself adjust to the new environment and take 4 classes if you intend to work. If you\u2019re already advanced in your program, that\u2019s up to you.\n\nHere\u2019s basically a correlation:\n\n15 credits = more work = higher chance to fail = average grades not the best too \n\n15 credits + working = need to be on your things = can\u2019t slack = chances of failing ++++ \n\n12 credits + working &lt; 15hours/week = pretty much the average student",

I'm in electrical engineering and just found it very hard to maintain work and university workload. Therefore I would say try it out, if by the end of the first month of uni you see you're falling behind then leave work and focus on university.",

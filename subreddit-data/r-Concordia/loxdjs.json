    "postText": "I just wanted to vent, because a lot of people seem to be super eager to return to in-person classes and I really am not. Especially since COVID restrictions will probably still be applied to some extent, in-person classes will be very restricting and unpleasant. Though I understand a lot of people are going through some hard times and to be clear, your difficulties are valid. But here are some things I think are great about online classes.\n\n* You can re-watch the lectures at 2x speed\n* You can immediately look up any unclear aspect of the lecture\n* You can more conveniently balance your internship in your class schedule\n* Most people stop attending in-person classes by week 3 anyway\n* You can get a much healthier amount of sleep\n* You have a lot more time to exercise\n* Professor office hours are way more accessible",

They use something called Panopto other highly rated universities use it too ... not even talking about lectures shared internally. A lot of Harvard lectures are even posted on YouTube not just internally shared. I can give a lot more examples too just wanted to stay consistent.\n\nConcordia is in the Dark Ages because not even their serves are up to par with what a university should have.\n\nEdited: Of course all before the Pandemic.\n\n[https://www.panopto.com/about/news/20-of-the-top-25-universities-worldwide-choose-panoptos-video-platform-for-lecture-capture-and-video-content-management/](https://www.panopto.com/about/news/20-of-the-top-25-universities-worldwide-choose-panoptos-video-platform-for-lecture-capture-and-video-content-management/)\n\nThere are countless other companies out there. I can give you a big list of universities too but it will be pointless.\n\nJust wondering before you state a fact do you actually do research or a simple google search? The way you state it I would have believed it if I didn't already know they do and have been doing so for a while now.\n\nI mean you are right in a sense if we are talking about all universities in the world .. considering universities which offer bachelors without any credibility and ones in places with no means of technology like here.\n\nAnother cool thing I don't know if Concordia does. Many universities like Harvard also do lectures out in the open. Like a park .. etc",

I'm just saying that it is easier when the courses are online as you can access the lectures when you have free time. I'm on an internship right now and I'm taking ECON 203 online. I'm able to study after work and on weekends as well. If courses were in person, I wouldnt be able to attend the lectures occurring in the day",

I love being able to watch lectures online whenever I want and being able to pause it without interrupting the entire class. Overall it made school way more comfortable for me as if I'm having a bad day or something I can skip this lecture and I can watch it later without fear of missing out on a physical class. \n\nAlso maybe I'm the exception but my professors have gotten back to my questions relatively pretty fast so that hasn't been an issue for me, most have even offered extra help that normally wouldn't be there to help students.",

I've contacted many profs about issues I had and since you don't ask them in person (aka harass them at their office) they don't give a fuck and don't even answer your mails. I have a prof basically all what he does is prerecord lectures, split the grade weight into 4 assignments and yell at students during his 2 hours of availabilities. Only god knows what he does during this semester.\n\nin my case i don't really mind if we keep online lectures but at least reopen the buildings, i wanna take my usual seat at 7th floor HB and look at the sunset during hours",

People cheat so profs curve the grade down to hell and then the people who didnt cheat suffer. Some profs make the exams insanely hard to avoid cheating. And don\u2019t get me started on proctored exams\n- certain classes require students to be in person practice - labs, etc. especially in engineering. We need to work with hardware. \n- human interactions - i miss seeing friends. Uni is the time to make friends and make connections for our future career as well. I have barely made any new friends since covid started.\n\nIn brief, I would be perfectly happy if schools are a mix of: online lectures + in person labs + in person tutorials + in person exams",

When classes are in person, I can't run in between classes cuz I wouldn't have time to go home, shower and change before attending my next class. Classes online allow you to go out in between classes and even skip class and watch the recording later in the day after your workout. People might also eat healthier as they can cook at home instead of having to eat at the many restaurants downtown because you didnt have time to make a lunch before leaving in the morning",

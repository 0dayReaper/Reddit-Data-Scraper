Unfortunately, her parents feel that university is leading her towards an unacceptable (read: progressive) view of life, and have completely cut her off financially unless she drops out.  \n\nAre there any campus resources she can possibly access?  She is working, but it won\u2019t be enough to pay for tuition and eating.",

If that's not enough she can apply for a bursary that she doesn't need to pay back at all. There's also the perspective scholarship, if she's in an eligible program she can get 2500$ per semester, ik engineering degree are eligible but there are a bunch of other too just google. All of this is done via the AFE website but you might need your program code which can also be found by googling.",

Also Concordia\u2019s financial advisors can help her and give more information from where she can get financial help and bursaries. It takes time to get a reply so I recommend to email the financial advisor directly if she already has the email address. Otherwise email the Financial aid and awards office and wait or call the office.",

I still had to work part-time too to pay rent and all the other expenses. \n\nAnother medium if you have a good adult friend with good credit who is willing, they could co-sign a student line of credit with a bank for you. \n\nI would recommend checking with student loans first. \n\nGood luck! I am a PhD now at Concordia. It's possible to do what you want but it will be a lot harder than most of your peers. Rooting for you. \ud83d\udc9c",

You should definitely follow the tips of others using government aid programs but she could take the legal route as well if she wants, thought it was worth mentioning since no one else did.",

That was a huge money-maker when I was in school. But Canada has a changed a lot, coop wages are no longer survivable. But that feeds into the whole lucrative program thing. If it's humanities/arts, there's tons of good Coursera courses + the library card. But yeah, it looks like she won't have long term parental support, so she'll have to be able to stand on her two feet economically.

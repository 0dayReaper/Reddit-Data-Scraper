Just FYI, a lot of students in that class assumed it would be a creative writing class but it's a typical english literary criticism class. You write arguments/essays about  assigned texts. It covered poetry and fiction ranging from the late 19th century in Montreal/Quebec to today. I don't know if the reading list has changed but some of the material we studied was more experimental and harder to get through. We didn't do any Leonard Cohen or Mordecai Richler.",

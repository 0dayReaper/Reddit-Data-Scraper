She can also go through material quickly, so better pay attention in class.\n\nNot a quick responder to emails either.",

Anything that be memorized use spaced repetition program like Anki.\n\nProf rating doesn't matter, they're not there to hold your hand and you are just a number in university. It's up to you.",

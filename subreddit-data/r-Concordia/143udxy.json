Unless you fucked up too hard, you get readmitted back 90% of the time. \nI dropped from 3.8 gpa to 1.2 in one year and got sent off due to failed standing lol but i reapplied and got back in\n\nThe idea of failed standing is basically its your one final chance to finish school after some time off, and if you do fall below 2.0 again when you get readmitted, its bye bye time.",

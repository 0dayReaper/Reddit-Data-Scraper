Clearly, the administration thinks that a petition of over **7000 signatures isn't being loud enough**. So lets bring this issue directly to their inboxes and send this open letter to as many people in the Concordia administration as we can manage.   \n\n\nI've compiled a list of over **140** **email addresses** of Concordia admin here: [https://gist.github.com/nixin72/23461816b2c8c131875972666fb2935c#file-recipients-md](https://gist.github.com/nixin72/23461816b2c8c131875972666fb2935c#file-recipients-md)  \nAnd the full open letter is here: [https://gist.github.com/nixin72/23461816b2c8c131875972666fb2935c#file-against-online-proctoring-md](https://gist.github.com/nixin72/23461816b2c8c131875972666fb2935c#file-against-online-proctoring-md)  \n\n\nTake **2 minutes** out of your evening to copy/paste that list of recipients and the message into your email, and send it off to everyone who might have influence over this decision. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's send Concordia a message that this **will not be tolerated.**",

Students that live in abusive households with parents looming over them, single parents who can't afford to have someone watch their kid while they take the test, students who share spaces with siblings or roommates and can't have a quiet space. This isn't about being some snobby rich kids whining cause we want better grades. \n\nNot to mention the fact that this is a normalization of spyware inside our homes, which is a terrible idea. There's so many reasons this isn't just about privileged children getting their way. You're right, this isn't as big as thousands of people around the globe dying of covid19, thousands more dying every year in wars. This isn't as big as 10 million Americans losing their jobs in 2 weeks or as big a thousands of other stories breaking across the globe. But Concordia still has a student body of almost 40,000 people, and we want to defend the privacy of every one of those students.",

In a way that\u2019s intelligent, and insightful, if the problem here is really that I\u2019m so uninformed. But sorry online proctoring or not, I\u2019m prepared for my exams. And I\u2019ll add that I live in an apartment in the middle of St-Laurent blvd. with my boyfriend, dog and cat. Not an environment conducive to studying or finals. But I\u2019m making the best of it, and you know why? Because I practice gratitude on the daily and with what is going on in the world, and I\u2019m not just talking about this virus, it just doesn\u2019t feel acceptable to me to open my mouth and complain when we are so incredibly blessed to attend Concordia and live in Canada.

            "comment": "I would like to offer my opinion regarding this subject considering my experience working closely with lawyers to manage legal contracts. \nI understand that Concordia University professors wanted to preserve the academic integrity and evaluate student\u2019s performance fairly. However, forcing students to consent for using proctor exam or dropping the course is a breach of the contract between the University and Students because: \n- this is a uni-lateral decision by the University which the other party to the contract (Students) must agree to. \n- the University is pressuring students to sign the consent as they are not offering another valid alternative. Dropping the course is not a valid alternative as it is late in the game and it impacts the students academic plan. \nConcordia University can offer more reasonable options (i.e. take-home-exam, assignment, consider previous performance, etc.) similar to other reputable universities in Quebec and Canada, and without setting such unfavorable precedence of taking away student\u2019s rights. \nSince the exam will not take a place at the University, as in normal situation, the University cannot control the environment when the exam is taken. Many factors (e.g. surrounding environment, different time zone, access to technology, access to reliable internet, etc.) can negatively impact the students\u2019 performance which would not be fair and very hard for professors to consider. Therefore, in order to fairly evaluate students\u2019 performance, it is better to provide other flexible arrangements (eg. take home exam, or consider previous performance, etc.) to attest the students have gained the academic knowledge to pass the course.",

They will cheat.

Like I said, we all confined and pissed or depressed but don't lie about it. That'll only make it worse. If you're so paranoid, defer your exam. 3-6 month delay in education isn't the end of the world. If YOU can't sacrifice 3 months which pass by so quick anyway for your own mental health and privacy...don't expect ConU to bend over backwards to give you an open book exam or open the door for you to cheat and pass. Someone monitoring you over a computer is no different than in person. Your little fake panic about credit cards and what not don't matter. If it did, you'd know how to protect yourself from that long before this pandemic.\n\n\nYou're doing an exam. You're not sleeping with someone and there's no sextape being released...\n\nThis is a 3-4 hour thing( maybe a few times)  where at the most you'll be caught with your finger in your nose or something similar. \n\nWhat's the most you got hidden in your PC? Credit cards info? Just wipe them or use an encrypted tool ( which is recommended anyway) to store them. You should already know that since privacy was such a big concern though...right?  the hypocrisy. \n\nTrue , someone with admin rights could do damage but so could anybody working at a bank a la Desjardins breach. Let me guess, you keep your money under the mattress? If you work at a telecom, employees have access to a lot of your info. You always this paranoid?  I don't recall students whining about that other than price of bills. \n\nYou could also uninstall software right after as well. Let me guess, you guys don't even know how to do that all of a sudden right? If you're in school now, you know more about basic computer stuff than any other generation before you. You grew up on it. \n\nFact is , if you guys had any idea about cybersecurity , you would all be walking around with webcams taped and would not have social media. IG, TikTok, Google, apple, etc. \n\nNOBODY WOULD HAVE A SMARTPHONE. If you're THAT student and the we'll talk privacy and about your concerns. \n\nI got no probs with a pass/fail, pass no matter what or monitored exam.\n\n\nChances are you'd fail your class anyway and you're fighting for this because it gives you a good chance of passing. Next semester, you'll be in the same situation. \nThere's a reason why so many are on meds. You overthink. It is what it is. Some of us can cope with it. Some can't.\n\n\nStudents just pissed boomers ain't buying their fake paranoia. They actually have to continue to study ...which I admit, is hard to do while quarantined.",

Quite the contrary, actually, as I did my first semester there and then moved here. But I am genuinely impressed with the grace and dignity with which they have treated their students, all while mine is taking more opportunities to shake my already shaken cage. \n\nNo one is taking you up on your points because it's a straw man and an false dichotomy.

Else why keep repeating it, right? And you do do that, over and over, as if no one was able to read it the first time.\n\nSorry that's so blunt, but my nerves are extremely frayed with all this fucking shit we live in (and nothing else to do, either). But bluntly, that's why no one wants to engage with you. \n\nFWIW, none of what you've said even strokes close to me because I am quite far from the imagined person you think you are talking to.

In the case of online proctoring, you're being recorded in your own home. The software needs remote access to your system so it can track and logs activity. You can't use Linux or a VM or a VPN so all of your information (banking, passwords,...) can be compromised. Someone is staring at you from behind the camera but you can't see them. They can easily install viruses or backdoors while having access to your system, etc. The list goes on.\n\nIt's not like there is no other alternative. For example profs can make the exam open book, but way harder so if students aren't prepared they will fail.\n\nYes you can defer, but the deferred exam might be online anyway lmao.

If you are with a no came cheap reseller company like Carrytel, you're using their crap modem router. Get yourself a homehub 2000( I think the 3000 is out now) and wifi should be very stable.    Another reason people complain about speed is the internet gamer who have always been bitching about lag. That has more to do with addiction imo. They'll always want the fastest tech because others or they'd win and shoot the other a few milliseconds quicker. Those guys usually have the sophisticated set ups and know more than the people they call for help. True story....one guy was shitting on me on mute (we can tell) while I was helping him once. He told me he was on a gaming website and I had his info(which he willingly gave to me anyway to confirm his identity). It was too funny. He was saying he'd go to a competitor to me like that's going to make a difference and suddenly fix his issues  but online he was saying he already tried the competition.  I told him he gave me all his info during the call and I was listening to him at the same time.  He bitched about invasion when he got caught (like students now) bit he's the one who said \"I'm a competitive gamer and you should come watch me blah blah blah\". \n\nHe just didn't like it when he got caught which reminds me students now. You want take home assignments. You don't want to be monitored. You expect the to believe you'll behave.\n\nAny experienced hacker can hack most people's internet very easily. Most people don't have the best security. If privacy was such a concern, people would not leave these loopholes open. You'd have taken steps yourself to protect yourself. Most don't. I know there stuff and even I don't care. \n\n\nAlthough I want us to have a freebie and no exams , I don't think you've ( or anybody else)  really made a valid point. It's all very murky. Everybody jusybsaysbi don't want to be filmed bit they don't really say why. They're acting like this is a 24/7 surveillance like some conspiracy nutjob. usually permissions that are given are just there to tell thebothe side of you're browsing or something. There will be red flags. If they remote into your computer, you should see the mouse move.\n\nStay safe and hope you do well.",

Acting like being monitored during an exam is equivalent to revenge porn video coming out but you're 100 mentally sane? \n\nBtw my random class this semester is an engineering/computer related class.  I'm not happy I gotta study a bit in this situation but I'm not acting like it's the end of the world either.\n\n\nBro you're in mech Eng...chances are you will be unemployed for a bit and might not even get a job that pays as well as software or hi tech related.  With the evonomy....evwn those guys might need dmorentime than usual. Take a break if you can't deal with it. A few months delay will not only be helpful and beneficial to your own mental health. If you can't do that for yourself....don't expect the world to care much.\n\nLater. Stay safe and good luck.",

Which is why we have designed our product to have students' privacy and security built in at its core and we have been recognized for it.\n\nNot only do we never require personally identifiable information, but we utilize Single Sign On, so that to enter an exam you only have to use the credentials already required by your school and/or LMS.\n\nProctorio only records and runs during an exam and if and when an instructor has chosen the audio, video and/or screen recording settings. This also means that the extension never runs before you start your exam or after you've submitted your exam.\n\nThe test-taker data we do collect is encrypted in three layers. The final of which is when the data is stored with \"zero-knowledge encryption\". This means, not even us here at Proctorio, have access to this data. The data is encrypted in such a way that makes it completely useless to any bad actor. It only becomes unencrypted when accessed by an approved school administrator.\n\nAs the cherry on top, since Proctorio is a Google Chrome extension you can uninstall and reinstall it as many times as you want to. It might offer you more peace of mind?",

First of all, being a Chrome extension it's written in JavaScript, which as some who has done JavaScript for the better part of the last 5 years, doesn't give me a huge amount of faith in it. With more and more universities going online, systems like proctorio are going to become a bigger and bigger target for malicious attacks. Attacks can come from all angles, including the client side. Even if you could assure your server side security was safe, which I will always default to assuming it's not - as should everybody with their backends, your client side is a JavaScript program, which is easy to tamper with. What if an attack against Moodle is discovered and that compromises proctorio? Or an attack against any LMS or major COTS product that universities use. I won't trust a Google Chrome extension on the client side.\n\nIn addition, this reply doesn't account for the section of the letter concerning the fact that there are things proctorio can't account for. A students internet cutting out during an exam could cause them to fail. A student living in a shared space, a single parent who needs to watch a young child, a student living in an abusive household, all of these are issues that can lead to students failing an exam given the nature of proctorio assuming that you have a quiet and reliable space on your own to take the exam.\n\nWhile this certainly doesn't apply to everyone, I am personally a Linux user and I avoid using Google products as I don't believe that Google is an ethical company. Even if you could convince me that your software is secure, which being a Computer Science student I will never believe a piece of software is 100% secure because there is *always* a way to break something, how can you convince me to install another piece of software that violates my ethics? In a period of time where we seemingly have less and less ability to make good and ethical choices, being forced to use Google Chrome kind of sucks. \n\nIn the AMA that you guys did a few months ago, the answer to every question seemed to be \"well it depends on how your professor configures your exam\", which is great and all, but if professors are using your software in the first place, it's because they want assurance students aren't cheating, so does it not follow that it's only natural for them to turn all settings on? Making the claim that it's up to our teachers seems like a moot point because they want something quick and easy to set up, and have made it pretty clear to us students that our privacy is not their priority.\n\nI'm glad professors are coming to their senses and cancelling a huge number of proctored exams, they're not okay.",

However, Proctorio cannot dictate what these alternatives are, that is purely up to your school, administrators, and/or instructors. Our agreements with institutions do require that they offer alternatives to students, though. \n \nTo \u201cassume\u201d that it is \u201cnatural\u201d for all instructors to turn on all settings for every exam is preemptive. Some instructors may choose to not utilize any of the recording options and just enable the Lockdown functions. Some may only want to record the screen and not audio or video. The case changes depending on the course and the instructor. Proctorio never chooses which settings to enable. \n \nYou are, also, assuming all of the instructors at your institution and at all other institutions want \u201csomething quick and easy to set up\u201d and that they do not have your privacy as \u201ctheir priority\u201d. This may be true for some, but it can\u2019t be for all. \n \nIt may be safer to assume that most instructors just want to uphold the academic integrity of their course and keep their online exam environment as fair as possible. How they decide to accomplish this is up to them, not Proctorio.",

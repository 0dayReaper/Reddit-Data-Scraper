Last year, we had the teacher list as soon as registration opened. Now it's freaking April and nothing. What is going on. Does the university not understand that people need to plan their lives around school, during summer even more so. And the teacher in question can decide whether the class is a drop or not. Also the list of good teachers just keeps going down. They don't hire new, better teachers. Instead, they offer tenure to complete duds that should've never been given a teaching position in the first place It's pissing me off.",

Especially in STEM, get used to it and learn how to teach yourself.\n\n**Here are some tips:**\n\n\\-YouTube is fucking great. usually you can find the whole class posted under a good Proff especially.\n\n\\-Avoid harsh graders over avoiding a bad teacher\n\n\\- Some of the textbooks are really good, so always give them a try. (often times the school knows which textbooks are good, so the professors leading research teams, nice way of saying put no effort,  are often put in those classes. )\n\n\\- email other professors for their PowerPoint slides if both the textbooks and your proff sucks, just be polite and don\u2019t diss their colleagues\n\n\\- Don\u2019t take Lena Sahlman, terrible teacher and really harsh grader\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**P.S: This is why you shouldn\u2019t complain about Tuition**\n\nIf you live on your own, you\u2019re also entitled to a bunch of money, the worse your conditions the more you get. Quebec only makes you pay if you can afford it\n\nIt\u2019s among the lowest in Canada and the world. We also don\u2019t/rarely have to pay for books in the pdf era. We gets thousands of dollars in potential benefits, a free easy to schedule GP, therapy, dentistry  etc\u2026 With that taken into account, it\u2018s really nothing to cry about. If you\u2019re an idiot you can even opt out of those and pay less lol.\n\nOr just join an in demand field and get quebec perspective Scholarship.",

And no, not a single professor will call themselves a teacher just because they're introducing you to new material and lecturing about the topic of the course. Teachers make sure they spoon feed you information and that you always show up. Professors are researchers who are there to lecture a group of students about the course and leave when they're done. Teachers have a teaching license, professors don't. Tabarnak get a grip\n\nEdit: Lmao, bunch of kids bombarding me with down votes can't handle the harsh reality of university. Professors aren't there to spoon feed you till you succeed. Stay in high school if you want that treatment. There are shitty professors, and that's undeniable, but nothing is stopping you from putting in the work and attending study groups to better understand the material.",

Professors are there to help but we're not just training for our programs, we're learning to learn on our own so we can always be growing with our profession.  You won't have people forcing you to learn new stuff in the workforce, now is a great time to develop those skills.  Not to mention professors usually will bend over backwards to help you when you attend their office hours (cause no one shows up).",

For me, both involved the exact same insane amount of work put in (believe me) yet the grade was drastically different. Why? Because some teachers are literally evil and are not there to help students achieve. They make exams insanely difficult, don't curve when averages are below 40-50. Show up to office hours with those teachers asking for help? You get laughed out of their office. If you haven't had such an experience, count yourself lucky and pray you don't in the future.\n\nI'm not saying this happens often but it does happen. Thus, my deep and probably trauma-originated want to know who teaches the course. It's that simple.",

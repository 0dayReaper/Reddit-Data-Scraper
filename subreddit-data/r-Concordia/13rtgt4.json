Despite not being engineering classes I struggled a little bit with some of those classes but what really helped me excel in them was doing all the recommended problems, understanding the theory and practising previous midterm and final exams until I knew what I was doing.\n\nThe following years was when I started taking my engineering classes. Engr 212, 213, 233, 242, 243 and 244 were by far the hardest classes that required the most energy and time put into them because of the difficulty and amount of material needed to cover for each topic. Just like my first year, I practised as much as I can with as many resources as possible to pass these classes.\n\nThe last few years of my degree were the easiest, apart from a few tough classes here and there, overall it wasn\u2019t as hard as I thought it would be. The material wasn\u2019t that hard although more work was needed for the assignments and projects. Capstone was the most time consuming class but putting in the hours and forming a team with people you can trust will bring you very far and make your life easier.\n\nIt\u2019s been an interesting journey meeting all my friends throughout these past five years both in campus and on Reddit itself and I\u2019m looking forward to start work shortly and begin my career.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about the school as I\u2019ve been through it all throughout my time here!\n\nWise_Guy_Plato out \ud83c\udfa4",

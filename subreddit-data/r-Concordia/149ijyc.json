    "postText": "I payed for my official AP results to be sent four months ago, and on the received document section of my student account, it appears as \"AP results.\" However, my to-do list is still asking me to submit official AP scores. I would like to inquire whether this extended delay is normal or if I should anticipate an update after the official AP release dates for this year (considering I have not taken any AP exams this year).",

If you were trying to access almost any Concordia online service yesterday in the morning to early afternoon, you must've felt the pain. The servers being offline for hours in the middle of an ONLINE school day was not fun. This helps at least a little to laugh at it.",

Some of us being in co-op also were expecting to be able to access the co-op compass portal to get info about interviews we had scheduled. We were not able to do any of those things for hours yesterday.   \nIt's possible that if you were already logged in to Moodle it worked because maybe the Moodle servers only communicate with the servers that crashed when you try to login ? Really not sure about that though.",

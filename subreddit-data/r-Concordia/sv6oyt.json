This woman was holding the whole escalator going through her purse while standing in the middle. I tried to squeeze by and I got such a mean look, I still feel weirded out. Not to mention, I missed the train because of her and she crossed me later and gave me another mean look. LADY I MISSED THE TRAIN BECAUSE OF U. Some people have really no idea on how reality works or they just don't care.",

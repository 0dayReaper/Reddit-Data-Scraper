    "postText": " I am enrolled in the graduate diploma economics My course starts from the coming September. However, for my visa application, I need to pay my Tuition for a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I paid the tuition for the Fall 2023 sem. However, while doing so (through CIBC) I paid CAD      7713.72 because that was the amount that showed up in the \u2018OUTSTANDING CHARGE\u2019 section. The total is about CAD 100 more than the aforementioned amount (which I saw later in the \u2018MY CHARGES\u2019 section). Do I make a separate payment for the remaining amount, or would that amount be accounted for in the Winter 2024\u2019s payment?\n2. After paying for the  Fall 2023 sem, I enrolled in the Winter 2024 courses. However, in the \u2018MY      CHARGES\u2019 section, the tuition doesn\u2019t show for the Winter courses. Also, the amount that I already paid for the Fall semester isn\u2019t yet showing, and the page says that I still owe that amount (which I have paid). \n\nPlease help me figure this out at the earliest as I need to apply for the visa too.",

It\u2019s up to you if you\u2019re gonna believe this but there\u2019s a theory going on that it\u2019s slower than the regular stream because of backlogs. I have a friend who applied under the SDS program, we lodged at the same date and time but I am under the regular stream. I got approved after 26 days. Meanwhile, my friend is still waiting for RE (38 days and counting). I know this is case to case basis but yeah, I don\u2019t need IELTS.\n\nAnyways, refer to the link provided by other user for the estimated tuition fees. Maybe you can deposit that amount to your student centre account and request for a receipt (there\u2019s an option on student hub just explore it, I think there\u2019s a payment for that). \n\nBut of course if you want to be sure, contact iso.",

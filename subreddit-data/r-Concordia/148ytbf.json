    "postText": "Hello all,   \n\n\nI'm a returning student after taking a 2-year break from Academia after loosing my brother. I want to be done with my degree ASAP because I've been slacking and I want to go back to school full-time but I could not afford to work anything less than my current job and there's no possibility to get adapted hours.   \n\n\nI am looking for easy electives (preferrably online) that I can complete for the Fall term (ideally none that start at 11 AM or don't end until then)\u2015I've taken THEO 204 before and it was pretty easy. Something of the sort would be perfect.  \n\n\nThe perks of my job are that it is completely remote, I can work from the campus, so no need to worry about getting there on time or not, though I do need to log into my work system at 11 AM (Monday to Friday).  \n\n\nI already have 2 classes schedules on Monday and Tuesday morning but I'm looking for 2 more easy electives that don't require a whole bunch of work (because I already have a taxing job).  \n\n\nI'm a native Arabic speaker (can't read or write for shit but can hold a conversation fine) and speak a li'l Spanish. I was considering taking a course in either but I'm afraid of the workload or necessary attendance.   \n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any ideas!",

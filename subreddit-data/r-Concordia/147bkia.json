    "postText": "Hey, I'm in the ECP program going into my first year and therefore have to take 4 electives, (2 from Social Sciences/Humanities and 2 from Natural Sciences). As I'm majoring in mechanical engineering, I don't want to overload my schedule with tough electives but still want to get the ECP ones out of the way. I really don't want to have assignments and tasks from elective classes be a worry, from experience, which electives are lightest?",

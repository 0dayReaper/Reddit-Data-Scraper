    "postText": "Hi, im an US Citizen accepted to Concordia University for fall 2023\n\nI received my acceptance letter from CAQ, and I want to apply for the study permit by port of entry (POE) through Montreal YUL Airport in 2ish weeks (end june).\n\nWill the officer have any reason to refuse my application because i\u2019m applying in June, which is 2 months before the start of school? \n\nI will live at my friend during my study times so I will just buy a 1 week ticket to mtl to apply at the airport and then go visit the school and get and idea of what I need to bring/ship to the place that I will live at.\n\nIf I give proof of my round trip ticket and explain that I wanted to apply this early by POE because online it takes 7+ weeks, will the officer be okay with it?\n\n\nI heard someone saying if you enter canada 60 days earlier than start of semester it\u2019s not good, but i\u2019m gonna assume that applies for students who wanna start living already there? and not in my case just an one week travel to apply and visit the school so I can have it all done in advance.\n\n\nAlso if for example I apply this week online, but I still come at the end of the june one week to mtl, can I still try to apply at the POE (willing to pay another 150). Or if I apply once and the application is in processing, I can\u2019t try this other way (poe).\n\nI apologize if my questions sound dumb, im just really stressed.",

[since you're from america, you don't need a student visa/eta/trv to travel to canada,](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1116&amp;top=16) so my advice is that you travel with your [proper identification](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-voyage/td-dv-eng.html) and nothing else, i believe that will be better!",

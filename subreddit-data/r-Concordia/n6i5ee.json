    "postText": "In a good way ;) A few minutes ago I wrote my last final of my last semester. After 4 years of triumphs and failures I can say I\u2019ve learned a lot as a student and I\u2019m excited to be done with school.\n\nNo more anything\n\nTo all of you out there who can\u2019t bear it anymore, remember if you keep at it, this will end and you\u2019ll have your diploma! And if you decide to drop out you\u2019ll do other cool stuff with your time in any case only positive things can come from it. \n\nI know I paid a high price for this in terms of mental health and time for hobbies but today is a new day and the world is opening up for me!\n\nCheers from a former undergrad can believe I made it!",

Did my last exam a few days ago as well.\nThough it seems that I'll have a lot of issues with my graduation due to the requirements of my degree's concentration changing recently (Computer Engineering, Pervasive Computing concentration). From the emails i've communicated, it seems I'll be told mistakengly that I have 5 credits left to do. And the advisor didn't reply to the email i sent on Monday.\nI feel like i'll be told 'u are right, but now it is too late to fix the issue'. The situation is stressing me out!",

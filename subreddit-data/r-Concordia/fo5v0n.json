However there are some profs who are doing a good job with this mess. Dr Brugiapaglia has done a great job so far with sending out emails and his first video lecture for engr 233 was pretty good. Nice to see in contrast to radio silence from other profs I have.",

First it was complaining that the school wasn't closing, quickly followed by snarky criticism of teachers moving to online mediums. Now it's all about the pass/fail option followed by insulting the current president. Btw some people in that last thread were straight up insulting the guy. Even if you aren't satisfied with his speed to react, or completely disagree, insulting him is senseless behaviour.\n\nI commend my profs, they've been great: practicing using zoom before the first online lectures, constant email updates, inventive/creative possible solutions for the finals. Good job.",

He probably did this course specifically because he knew it would be controversial (especially if you read his course description) and it would get his name out. He's probably already trying to line up media interviews to talk about \"the controversy surrounding the course\". The real sad part is that Concordia is enabling him.",

I think it's more just people expressing how they think it's dumb to have a course about a celebrity/pop music star. He may be influential but his influence is primarily in the domain of commercial music which I don't think tends to be highly regarded in fine arts departments. It's like having a course on the big mac at a culinary institute.",

The idea that studying Kanye\u2019s music is \u201cdumb\u201d just because he\u2019s a celebrity is very shallow in my opinion. I don\u2019t think anyone denies that he\u2019s a very talented creator; I really believe that no one who seriously listens to his stuff would think there\u2019s nothing there, so to dismiss him just because he\u2019s a celebrity is just not being critical.",

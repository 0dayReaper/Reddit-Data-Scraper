The club will also work together on larger projects attached to the club, to both improve Concordia campus life and personally develop skills in the various fields relating to the project.\n\nEssentially have software dev., engineering students, business students, art and science students, to meet and help each other, and find one another.\n\nI would love to know if you would be interested in joining, what is your background (major) if you are, and do you think others would be?",

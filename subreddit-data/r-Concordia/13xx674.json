    "postText": "During my first year I could stay at home with my parents while I went for school as it drastically reduces the expenses you incur as a student. I am, for reasons quite easy to guess, now alone. I am actively seeking work and I am looking for places to stay, but as it stands now, I am homeless in everything but legal status. Is there any kind of assistance I could get from the uni or any kind of orgs?",

Also if you are studying engineering and did at least 12 credits last semester, look up the quebec engineering bursarie. It's not going to give you a place to stay but a few extra bucks in your pocket would probably help you out.",

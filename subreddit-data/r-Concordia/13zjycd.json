    "postText": "This summer semester, the COMM308 coordinator decided to not allow students to bring cheat sheets anymore to the exams, they now provide a half-empty formula sheet that is basically useless. Does anyone know the logic behind this decision? Because clearly averages of 19% and 27% last semester proved there was something wrong with this course, how are they making it even more difficult now? My question is if anyone knows the logic behind this decision, have they made the exams shorter/easier?",

It relies on you being able to link multiple concepts together\n\nFor example, in class, all the practice problems are \u201c30 years, 5% rate, x amount of initial dollars etc\u201d\n\nOn the exam, you will see problems where stuff is compounded every day, and halfway through the interest rate changes, and then you add extra money at the 3/4 way etc\u2026 its testing you on if you can combine all those different factors without getting lost in the calculations\n\nTherefore, no cheat sheet will help with that, as you said even with cheat sheets (believe me, i saw some peoples sheets that were just LOADED with content) the average was still in the 20s. This class is designed to make u fail at least once, its a weed out class",

The class average could be 10%, it could be 50%, the final grades are curved so it doesn't matter how difficult the material is. A certain target % of students will always be assigned As, Bs, Fs, etc.\n\nAs an example I took COMM 217 last semester and felt like I probably put in a 60% effort out of 100% on the midterm and final. I ended up getting a B instead of a D because I did marginally better than the average of the rest of the class.",

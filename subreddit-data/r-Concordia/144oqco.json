    "postText": "I have been searching for apartments for 3 months now. I have toured about 15-20 places. I keep getting beat out because so many others are also applying/viewing and I end up being the 4th or 5th person in line. My most recent place I looked at was perfect and I was the first to view it and apply for it but the landlord automatically picked someone from Canada before even looking at my application because I am international (from the states). I have to be out of my current apartment in July and I am panicking. How were you able to find a place or do you know of anyone moving out soon? I\u2019m not picky about the location just trying to stay under $1000 and preferably laundry in the building. Being closeish to a metro would be great. I work full time but I don\u2019t have credit here in Canada yet because I just moved here 6 month ago. I am at the point of just trying to apply to as many places as I can and hope someone will pick me. But most places won\u2019t even let you apply unless you visit in person and then they decide if you can apply. Please give me any advice you may have or places to look to move asap!",

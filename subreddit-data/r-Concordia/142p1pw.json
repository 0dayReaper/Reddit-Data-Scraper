    "postText": "I have done 51 credits that transferred into my new program (but completed 57) out of 90. I took a year break because no degree in particular interests me at all. I'm thinking of going back as an independent student, but I'm worried that will still force me to pick a degree in the end. Is it possible to finish with a general bachelor's degree? Very specific courses in one domain are difficult for me. I already have a career but I would still like to finish my bachelor's degree.\n\nAny thoughts or experience with this? Advisors answer very slowly so I thought I'd try here in the meantime. Tyia",

            "comment": "As I understand it, Independent studies is just \"an authorization\" to register for credit courses. It's not a degree program, so there's no ending like graduation, certificate or degree. To get a degree, you need to apply and fulfill the course requirement of that degree. There's no generic general Bachelor. It's either BA, BSc, BCom, BEd, BEng, BFA, or BComSc.  \n\n\nThere's a nice video :)  \nhttps://www.concordia.ca/admissions/independent-students/independent-admission.html",

    "postText": "EDIT: thank you everyone for your help! I filled a Declaration of Change and the \u201cdeclaration by father\u201d disappeared! \n\n\nOp:\n\nHas anyone had difficulty when they applied to the Quebec full-time bursaries and loans? I did the practice dozens of times and everything went well. I\u2019ve been living alone since I\u2019m 18 (was kicked out of an abusive household) and recently changed my legal address to my dad\u2019s house so that my mail can go there since I\u2019m moving out of my apartment (the rent is too high) and I still don\u2019t know where I\u2019m gonna go, so I wanted a sure address for my important mail. \n\nHowever, when I did my real application, it asked my dad to fill out a form. My dad declares well over $125k per year from his company, but he will never (unless Hell freezes over) pay for my schooling nor any living expenses. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get $0 as government aid since his income is so high. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? \n\nI was thinking of calling to explain my situation, how can they possibly think my dad would contribute when I specifically indicated I\u2019ve been living ALONE for years, even working full time to support myself. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated",

But if so that would be considered a means of financial support. Not sure how long before you resume renting but they take all of this under consideration. Talk with them to consider your options.",

You'd have to explain your situation to a social worker from the school, though. I think having the address be your dad's will be a problem though, but I'm not sure.",

You need to prove it by sending records of employment that amount to more than 2 years of full time work while you were not in school. Living alone means nothing to them if you were also going to school. They don't really make any exceptions. They're super strict about it and you would need to go private(bank).",

I\u2019ve had a problem FOR MONTHS now because of an issue of proof of residence and they refused any other option even though I explained the situation. Honestly just change your mail or use a friends and ask them to attest that you live with them even tho your name is not on the lease, it\u2019ll make things a lot easier.",

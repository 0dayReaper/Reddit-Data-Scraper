    "postText": "Tldr: I am tempted to not attend the graduation ceremony because I have a lot of shame and regret regarding my poor performance in uni (I am the \u2018 I got a 34 r score n cegep and then nearly flunked out of uni trope) I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll stick out like a sore thumb with no distinction or honours or anything . I\u2019m embarrassed and ashamed. Do you relate/ think I\u2019ll regret it if I don\u2019t go?\n\nI registered for the graduation ceremony at the very last minute, because I had been putting it off and honestly just felt very sad when I thought about it. I entered Uni feeling amazing with a great r score, and shortly after my first semester something very difficult happened and I basically crashed BADLY for like 2 years. To the point where o legitimately don\u2019t recognize the person I was during that time. I went from a 34 Cote R.  to not showing up to finals.. plural. I got help and finished strong on my last semester, but the damage is pretty much done. In one of my seminars I got an A and asked the prof if he would consider a reference, and he said of course but to send him my transcript because he needs to ensure I have a good GPA (I don\u2019t, even with retaking some classes there\u2019s only so much I can do) so I didn\u2019t pursue that further. I understand &amp; ultimately blame myself but it hurts to know that I will pay for those mistakes I made at 19/20 years old and that they\u2019ll stop me from pursuing my studies further, now that I\u2019m in a better place. \nBasically, because of the regret and shame I feel about my performance I am extremely tempted to not go to the graduation ceremony. It sounds stupid but I am embarrassed because when my name is called it won\u2019t be with distinction or honours, and though I guess that might be common I feel like it will just be a reminder to myself of how bad I blew it and my family will be disappointed.\n\nDoes anyone relate to that feeling of shame &amp; regret regarding your performance and wanting to miss the ceremony to not be reminded of it? Do you think I would regret it if I didn\u2019t go? \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post this, I am just struggling and wanted to see if anyone felt the same/ had advice.",

We did it! Forget those bad notes. Celebrate. I celebrate your achievement. You kept going even if it was difficult. That is the important thing. I am planning to party all summer because I graduated. Cheer up and relax on yourself. You can achieve a lot more if you positively reinforce yourself sometimes. It\u2019s good to be aware of your failings but applaud your achievements. You did it! Woot woot! I relate to your shame and embarrassment as I have often felt that way remembering my past mistakes. That being said, fuck \u2018em. My graduation means I flush those past feelings and replace it with some pride which everybody deserves when they work to better themselves.",

Still graduated, still went to the ceremony. \nJust finishing university is something worth celebrating. \nYou never know what will happen after (I\u2019m going in for a second degree and got a 4.3 GPA for two semesters in a row, so really anything is possible lol)\nBe proud of what you achieved. Uni is difficult, especially if you\u2019re going through other shit. Who cares if you didn\u2019t get honours - 90% of people don\u2019t, that\u2019s why it\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d but you don\u2019t need to be special, you just need to be yourself. Some people thrive in uni and are unable to do well at work, some tank uni and are mega successful in life. It\u2019s just a piece of paper, but you earned it, so go pick it up on stage!",

            "comment": "As someone who attended, most people don\u2019t have distinction/awards/etc, they\u2019re just getting their diploma. You could have the highest non-distinction GPA or the lowest possible and there\u2019s really no difference at the graduation ceremony. I know it may feel like it, but there won\u2019t be a big neon sign saying your GPA is bad.\n\nAlso the convocations are massive. No one\u2019s really paying attention to anyone except the person they\u2019re there for. Or if you happen to know another name called out it\u2019s \u201coh hey cool they graduated\u201d.  \n\nIt\u2019s also a stressful day for all grads, they won\u2019t pay much attention to you either. I attended my ceremony, and knew at least 5 other people graduating, and gun to my head I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you if any of them got distinctions or not. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s some nice closure after graduating. I\u2019m glad I went.",

I have really been in my head about this even though I know it\u2019s not rational (the neon sign comment is spot on) and this really helped me put it into perspective. Like really, really helped. Thank you for being kind about this. I\u2019m glad you went &amp; got closure, honestly I finished in the fall and it doesn\u2019t feel real that I graduated so maybe the ceremony will give me that closure too hahaha",

If you got a good Gpa I think it\u2019s 3.5+ they will say with distinction when they call your name. If you didn\u2019t they just say your name. It\u2019s a small thing it\u2019s more the fact that I\u2019m mad at myself for my mistakes in Uni that will make it hurt/make me feel embarrassed because I know I could have done better. It would feel different if I tried my best but I stopped showing up to finals and was completely apathetic for a year only to snap out of it and be horrified by what I\u2019ve done. My last semester gpa was 3.8 but it barely raised my overall gpa which is still below 3. I know I\u2019m 1 of hundreds and I know no one but myself and my family will even care/notice though, its more about  the shame I feel myself.",

Hey, something I've learn in my years of studying (I have 2 degrees now) is that graduations are not a big deal, you might not miss anything if you don't go, BUT i feel like it is also important to celebrate small victories. I know saying it won't change anything but don't be so hard on yourself, I'm sure lots of people are proud of you, and they would like to see you on the stage.",

People don't care and probably won't even be thinking about you. \n\nYou finished your degree and struggled through it. It's more than many others can say. Go to your ceremony.   \n\n\nFor my first degree, I had average grades and I never went to my ceremony and feel like it's a missed experience. I also failed some courses during my degree even after being pretty much a high school \"A\" student. Don't fault yourself, uni is a different beast and we learn, grow, and level up. \n\nDon't compare yourself to others or put them on a pedestal. We all work within the skills and aptitudes we have and everyone faces different struggles.",

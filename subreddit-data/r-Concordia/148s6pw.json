Is there a time limit to finish a bachelors? What are the steps to notify the registrar's office? Would I need to reapply? Etc\n\nAny help would be appreciated",

The length of time depends on your faculty but it's no longer than 9 consecutive terms (3 years). 2 years for JMSB and Gina Cody, 3 years for Faculty of Fine Arts and Faculty of Arts and Sciences. To be readmitted all you have to do is speak to the academic advisor, with the exception of the Gina Cody school where they will ask you to reapply.\n\nyou may also have to resubmit proof of legal status in Canada and Quebec Resident status\n\nYou can see all the information you need here: [https://www.concordia.ca/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/returning-students.html](https://www.concordia.ca/admissions/undergraduate/requirements/returning-students.html)\n\nFor a formal answer to your question about who you need to notify, please contact students@concordia.ca",

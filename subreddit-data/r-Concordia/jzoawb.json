    "postText": "Hey everyone! Because the original post was an image upload, I wasn't able to edit/update the captions, so I hope many of you are able find this post to hear about what has happened since uploading to now.\n\nHoly moly, the amount of support I have recieved in the past 48 hours is overwhelming; I have a plethora of messages full of thanks, suggestions, and stories- thank so you much for entrusting me with your words and kind thanks. If I have not gotten back to you, I apologize; I am working through the list (and also still working a regular job) and I will get back to you.\n\nThe most exciting news of all, however.... We are getting news coverage! I just finished an interview with CityTV this morning, and it will be airing either later this evening, tomorrow at 6pm, or both- and will be up as a news clip on Facebook as well. I have also heard from a handful of student stations/podcasts, both of our papers (LINK and The Concordian) and two other huge national news stations that I am unsure if I can discuss or not; but, rest assured we are getting the full news coverage treatment.\n\nI am doing my best to vouch for those of you who agree with my letter and are struggling with the school currently; evidently as you might assume, it was overwhelming and empowering to recieve so many emails from media groups looking to speak with me. I am doing what I can and keeping it diplomatic, yet firm; I won't let Concordia live this down and will continue to do my best.\n\nAnyway, that's all- just wanted to update you all on where I have gotten media-wise. If you can, tune into CityTV tonight at 11 and tomorrow at 6 to catch our little news bit; hopefully they cut the few bits where I get nervous and salvage the good stuff!\n\nCheers, guys- as long as we keep making noise, a change is always possible. Let's keep going!",

A couple of weeks after, Concordia allowed us to have pass/fail for both terms. Not sure if my letter and the publicity were a huge influence, because the CSU also sparked a lot of word regarding our frustration as well. Either way, we at least got a pass/fall out of it!\n\nConcordia never responded directly to me. They DID, however, respond directly to The Concordian when their piece on me was published- of course, TC has more resources then I, so I'm guessing they pulled some strings to make it happen. I am grateful for them to allow me a platform to further express our concerns.\n\nI'm also pretty sure that I am not done my activism role in voicing the student bodies concerns. They didn't tell students that out of province Medicare was mostly unsupported until AFTER we paid our healthcare fee (meaning it was essentially free money) and I also can't believe how super unethicial it was to continue to utilize the videos created by a deceased teacher without informing students. I need a bit of rest after the popularity of my original letter to them, but I am most likely not done- they will continue to sweep things under the rug, and as long as I am still studying and paying them, damn straight I am going to voice my concerns.\n\nThey better start moving much quicker the next time they see my email in their inbox. Now that I know how to find out what is really the core of the majority of student's issues and where to find them/ask students what they would like me to voice, I have no problem getting signatures for next time when they pull a wrong move.",

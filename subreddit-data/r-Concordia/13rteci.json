    "postText": "Hi I have a question! Can you apply for the Quebec Perspective and Quebec Mobility Boursary at the same time? For example, a Computer Science student from Concordia studies at Japan. Will the student still pay his normal tuition fees or is it subsidized by the Perspective Boursary and will the student also get the 3500$ from the Mobility? Thanks!",

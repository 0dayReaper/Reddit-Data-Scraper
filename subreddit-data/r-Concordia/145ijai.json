    "postText": "Hi, I applied for AFE last year and it recently confirmed my income for 2022 so on AFE website it shows I only have 4000$ are considered as loan the rest are considered as bursary. But when I go to my bank page it shows my loan is the 4000$+the rest.   So I was just wondering if it\u2019s normal? Does it need a long time to be updated? \n\nThanks ~",

At the end of each academic year, AFE confirms your income with the information provided to Revenu Qu\u00e9bec and does a loan to bursary conversion at which time your bursary is removed from your loan debt.",

Went to my bank (rbc) and asked them abt it. They told me to not worry abt it and that it's normal. They said that once i'm done with my studies and i'm no longer eligible for AFE and it's time for me to repay the loans, the right loan amount will appear. \n\nI'd still recommend you to go and visit the nearest bank branch and ask them!\n\nHope this helps :)",

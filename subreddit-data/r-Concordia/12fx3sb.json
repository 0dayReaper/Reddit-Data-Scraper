I\u2019m almost positive she was watching me &amp; i was probably bobbling my head back and forth while asleep. I have no electricity at my place and have been running on 2 hours of sleep so I\u2019m exhausted. Would hate to realize she was doing a tic Tok vid of me without my consent.\n\nShe was wearing a super small Guess back pack with a black North face jacket and black jeans with white outlines on her pockets.\n\nSome people just have no care for privacy of others. I\u2019ve never recorded or even thought about recording other students who are unaware or unwilling to be recorded.",

Otherwise you can film someone without their consent in most situations as long as there is no audio.\n\nEven then, audio recording is a one-party consent here.

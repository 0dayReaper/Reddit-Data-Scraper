But also a big hatred of neoliberal capitalism, the corporate world or bs white collar jobs in general (fuelled exponentially by my studies themselves thanks to the post marxist approach of most of my profs). Stayed in academic research - got burnt out due to very toxic environments. Now Im working in trades (teamster) and making as much (and free gym). If I had done a trade school I\u2019d be making triple the money. It depresses me to know that my dream jobs pay as much as I make now + cerebral stress burnout. I am 31, looking into trade schools of less than a year I can attend while working a bit (mostly HVAC). Goal is to have a trade position in the municipality / government with union and pension. \nThank god I am happy and live a frugal and pleasant life despite all the anxiety the word is throwing at me. Although it is still hard to make my parents (who paid for my education Marx bless them) make peace with it (they think I am \u00ab\u00a0beneath myself\u00bb. Being from the too positive parenting era of the 80s/90s they still think \u00ab\u00a0I can achieve great things\u00a0\u00bb but they are now themselves struggling financially so they are warming up to the idea and all will hopefully be well :) \nSorry for long answer but had to \u00ab\u00a0vent\u00a0\u00bb about my life :D.",

                            "comment": "Idk what ecp is tbh with you but Aerospace at Concordia is very very good (in my opinion). There\u2019s a good balance between theory and practice. I didn\u2019t find Option A particularly difficult. However, the first two years are kind of hellish because of the high admission rates into engineering as a whole and they try to filter a considerable percentage of people out. I say that because getting straight A\u2019s in the first two years might be very difficult. You might end up with not so good grades (might even get F\u2019s) but don\u2019t lose hope. Around the 3rd and 4th year it gets easier but the workload increases, especially with Capstone. Overall I\u2019d give it an 8.2/10. Hope this helps \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42",

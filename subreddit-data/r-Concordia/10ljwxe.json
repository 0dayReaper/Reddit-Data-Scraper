Some people treat it like some kind of holy relic, there was even a year where the student council thought about leaving some kind of commemorative plaque underneath but the dean wouldn't have it.\n\nHe tried ordering the janitor to remove the darn thing but apparently, and this part is probably pure bs, the ghost of the dude floated next to it and told the janitor: leave that there! Don't be a square, man!\n\nIt's been untouched ever since.",

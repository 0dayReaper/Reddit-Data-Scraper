I also use technology in my program all the time so maybe it\u2019s just more obvious to me?\n\nIdk I however have used google maps for like 12 years now and it only got me lost once so I\u2019m pretty dedicated to it now lol.:)",

Google maps claims everything is normal and even shows ETA for the next bus.\n\nIn reality the bus stop is closed indefinitely since last year. This information is shown at STM website and also on Chrono and Transit apps.",

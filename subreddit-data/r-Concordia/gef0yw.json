    "postText": "I don\u2019t know why Concordia teachers are so scared or unwilling to record and post their lectures. Almost all McGill profs do it and it makes the lives of students 10x easier. You can miss a class and not stress on how to catch up. You can skip a class for work and just catch up that very night. You can go over lectures at your own pace while pausing and unpausing the video and actually learn instead of just scribbling down notes without retaining anything. There\u2019s so many benefits for students that I wish teachers will continue posting them even after school resumes to normal.",

This requires two things:  1) actual students in the room, and 2) students interested and willing to speak.  Knowing there are recordings limits both of these.  Some may not want to share knowing it will be available \"forever\", and others will simply not show up to class.  So some McGill professors do NOT record for this purpose.  I do see benefits to it of course, and wonder if there was a way of only posting if certain criteria (such as attendance) are met.",

Most professors I've come across allow individual recordings after all.  \n\nAnd I doubt it's about \"feeling good about themselves\".  Perhaps it's a motivational technique to try to get those \"lazy\" students to change their ways?  After all, there's no guarantee the lazy students will listen to the recordings at all.  \n\nOr perhaps it's to try to get MORE discussion, etc.  Or to save and share information collectively?  If dozens of students listen at home alone, then hypothetically dozens of students may have individual questions they COULD have asked mid class, that could have been addressed for EVERYONE simultaneously.  This idea is a type of process gain, or social facilitation, where the collective group benefits from being part of a group, rather than a series of individuals.  \n\nIn the end, I think part of the question is who exactly should the professor cater to?  If you think it should be the bottom of the students (in terms of them being lazy, for example), then fine, perhaps that is one way, though perhaps some of my suggestions above are too.   Either way, I imagine it depends on the professor and the department/course material as well.",

Office hours are also a good time to discuss with the prof, once you've had enough time to review the material to be sure you didn't understand something (and/or to make comments, suggestion, etc). But when discussions are encouraged in class, they're mostly made of the prof asking questions where the answers are on the next slide (so that someone can look smart for knowing them before we've talked about them), other times people ask questions just for the heck of saying something (and being noticed), etc. I prefer when the prof just gives the lecture and we listen (and do a question period at the end, once we've had time to finish the lecture).\n\nEdit: I'm saying this with engineering courses in mind btw. I suppose class discussions may be more useful in areas like humanities, philosophy, etc.",

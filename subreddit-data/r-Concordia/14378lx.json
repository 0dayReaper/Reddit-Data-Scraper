    "postText": "Is there a tour of the residence? I got a room offer and I\u2019d like to know what it looks like (small single). Almost all of my classes are in loyola which is really convenient plus making friends easier. Grey Nuns was my first option and I would\u2019ve preferred it there.  Downtown has sm more life and it\u2019s seems more fun. Plus it\u2019s cheaper to rent. Only con is the commute and social life. If anyone has images of their room , i\u2019d love to see it!",

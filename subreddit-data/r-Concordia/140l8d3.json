    "postText": "Hey! So I am an International Business student at JMSB and I am about half into my degree, 51 credits out of 90 (completed most COMM courses, did 15 credits out of 24 for electives, and just started my major classes). \n\nMy question is can I apply this late for a double major which would be for International Business and BTM (or another JMSB major) for example? \n\nShould I just reach out to my course coordinator? \n\n(I am a domestic and COOP student if that matters) \n\nThank you!",

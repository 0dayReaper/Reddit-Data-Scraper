In engineering at least you can go up to like 8 semesters without taking any classes until you are no longer considered a student. \n\nBut any semester you take 12 credits or above you will still be considered full time again.",

I applied to around 15 jobs on compass (out of 30) and got 2 interviews and got chosen for both of them (somehow). I don't think grades matter that much as long as you have around or above 3.o gpa. I think what matters most is how you sell yourself in your cv and your cover letter. and also how charismatic you can be in your interview. \n\nI have some friends in software and computer engineering and I've heard is harder to get interviews because so many people apply but as long as you apply to as many as you can I'm sure you'll get something. \n\nMy mistake was that I was too scared of getting a job so I applied to ones I didn't really want.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have taken a class at Concordia that I could do at Cegep. My advisor told me that if I want to get exempted from the class because I did it at Cegep, I will not get credited. I wanted to know if my grade would still count towards my GPA, meaning if you take a non-credited class, dies the grade counts towards your GPA. \n\nThanks in advance and sorry for my shit English",

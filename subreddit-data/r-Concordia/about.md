Description:

The reddit for students of Concordia University of Montreal, Quebec / Le reddit des étudiants et étudiantes de L'université Concordia à Montréal, Québec

Rules:

Respect everyone: Remember the human on the other side when commenting. Insults, personal attacks, or hate speech of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes but is not limited to derogatory language and any form of discrimination, whether overt or subtle.

Maintain civility and conduct yourself appropriately, whether you're engaging in a debate with other members or appealing a post removal or a ban.

Repeat offenders will be banned.

Stay on-topic: All posts must be relevant to Concordia University and its community. Posts that are off-topic may be removed at the moderators' discretion.

Examples of off-topic posts: self-advertising (products, services, content); petitions without prior approval; social network posts/links (personal social media, "looking for friends", etc.)

If you would like to meet like-minded students and make friends, consider joining our Discord server or an existing official student group, club, or association.

No low effort posts: * Don't post similar or easily answered questions.
* Don't create multiple threads for the same question.
* Post titles must be descriptive. Don't just use the course number or title it with "HELP".
* If your post could be answered using a simple search, you probably don't need to ask it here.
* Don't just comment with one word or saying you agree/disagree, elaborate on your reply.

Posts that break this rule will be removed and repeat offenders will be banned.

No advertisements without mod approval: Posting ads without prior approval is a bannable offense. Please contact the [Mod Team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Concordia) before posting your ad.

You must get permission to post petitions, non-student surveys (surveys for Concordia classes are allowed without prior permission), research opportunities, and job postings.

Your ad must be relevant to the Concordia community.

Advertising tutoring services is not allowed unless you're replying to a request for tutoring.

No spamming, trolling, flamebaiting, and drama: Don't post about the same topic or question repeatedly. Do not deliberately upset people by posting inflammatory or offensive messages to mislead or offend others. Do your best to engage conversations in good faith. Don't make posts that could encourage drama.

If you have a post history of spamming, trolling, flamebaiting (deliberately creating posts that ignite arguments or steering people towards anger for entertainment), or inciting drama, you will be banned without appeal.

No unverified accounts/claims and misinformation: Accounts claiming to be Concordia staff or posting on behalf of the university and official groups will be subject to verification. This measure is in place to prevent impersonation and misinformation.

[Contact the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Concordia) to get verified and receive the appropriate flair, or if you find an account making claims without a verified flair.

Posts from unverified accounts will be removed. Ignoring this rule is a bannable offense.

Don't post about controlled/illegal substances: Trying to facilitate the sale or exchange of controlled substances (drugs, alcohol) is not allowed on campus. The same is true for here. This is a bannable offense.

No cheating: * Don't ask for or share links to group chats that help facilitate cheating
* Don't ask for or openly share textbook access and copyrighted course materials
* Don't share answers or have conversations while an exam is taking place

Cheating is a violation of academic policies and any accounts breaking this rule will be banned without appeal.

No doxxing, sockpuppetry, and ban evasion: Do not doxx (releasing personal information about people without their consent). Doxxing is harassment and will lead to a ban without appeal.

Do not create multiple accounts in order to manipulate discussions or harass others during a heated debate. Accounts found to be in violation of this rule will be banned.

Attempts to bypass bans by using alt accounts can be reported to Reddit admins. Please report any suspicious accounts to the mods, and provide proof to help facilitate the process.

Follow Concordia and Reddit policies: * [Concordia's Guidelines on Academic &amp; Community Conduct](https://www.concordia.ca/conduct.html)

* [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439)

The r/Concordia Mod Team is obligated to enforce these rules, and will issue warnings/bans when deemed necessary.

Use the megathreads: If your post falls under an existing megathread, it will be removed. Refer to the current sticky posts or the megathread flair/tag if your post gets removed due to this rule.

No social media links without mod approval: This includes but is not limited to: Discord, Facebook, Whatsapp, etc. even if they are labeled as "study group" or "group chat". [Message the mod team](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Concordia) prior to sharing any links or they will be removed.

Exceptions to this rule: links to official Concordia social media accounts, pages, groups, events, and more, including Club &amp; Association social links; Discord links listed in the [Concordia Academic Discord Network](http://redd.it/noggnu/)

No drama and inquiries related to Discord servers: You may share links to academic Concordia Discord servers. This rule applies to any attempts to incite drama related to Discord servers, whether affiliated with r/Concordia or otherwise, and Discord ban appeals, which will be ignored.

Please send your Discord-related inquiries to the appropriate mod teams. ModMail sent through Reddit is addressed to the r/Concordia mod team and is strictly for Reddit-related issues.

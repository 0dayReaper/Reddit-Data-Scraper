Yes, in an ideal world I, along with everyone else should be zen and calm in a verbal exchange but I\u2019m a human being and I\u2019m far from perfect. I\u2019ll add for context that for the last 2 weeks, every single day I browse through Reddit and see students verbally assaulting the VP and faculty and it royally pisses me off. I find the behaviour of most in this subreddit appalling and I think they deserve a good slap upside the head for how they\u2019ve handled the situation. So, when I see a comment like this guy, who just last week was crying \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d now openly admit his actual intentions, sorry but that lying hypocrite deserves to get called out. \nAnd for the other individual who asked how I know, do I really need to explain that to you? Is it not completely obvious? I think it\u2019s generally known that on Reddit, you can view someone\u2019s post history. I also recognized his user name from another post.

In an ideal world we can debate perfectly but we\u2019re humans after all. With that said, I still think you failed to answer his genuine question. You could have answered his question properly and within reason but you chose to go the route of being sarcastic and glib, thus you kicked your own argument in the nuts. It is not unrealistic to expect humans to answer a simple question properly. You could have shown people what you meant and could have proved your point but you chose the easy emotional route of being sarcastic and glib. Waste of an opportunity imo. I think that\u2019s why you got downvoted. \n\nAll of this to say you were unnecessarily dismissive of a simple question. It\u2019s not enough to to be simply right. You also have to be empathetic. You were probably right about him being a hypocrite, but you didn\u2019t have to treat the other guy that way and accuse him of being privileged when all he did was ask a simple question. Again, you erupted at a guy for asking a simple question. No matter what point you\u2019re arguing, that\u2019s not a civil way to behave.\n\nAnd with that said, even if the guy you responded to turns out to be a hypocrite, what is he doing that will harm the students now? Is the dean going to see his comment and post history and suddenly reinstate COLE? Is the media going to portray Concordia students as some kind of cheap freeloaders? It\u2019s weird that you would blow up at such a harmless (but admittedly stupid) comment. \n\nThere are plenty of people in the world who say stupid harmless shit all the time, are you going to blow up every time at them?\n\nMy entire comment can be summarized by saying \u201cCalm down\u201d which some other dude actually did, as you can see.\n\nEdit: plus you began your original comment by saying \u201cYou guys\u201d and thus you were portraying all of us as hypocrites.

But I already admitted to that and gave you context of why I had run out of patience. You\u2019re viewing things from a surface level, but things are never as simple as one sarcastic comment. Like I said it was building up and unfortunately because of what I\u2019ve viewed in this subreddit, I\u2019ve kinda developed a bias against most Concordia students. Should I? No, I shouldn\u2019t because when I stop and think about it, it\u2019s just a lack of maturity and life experience. Does it excuse my behaviour? No, I shouldn\u2019t have been sarcastic or bitchy, but I have a tendency to be impulsive and I allowed my ego to take control rather than my highest self. I\u2019m human, a work in progress. \n\nAnd if you really want to get deep, if I think of myself operating at my maximum potential, my ideal self, I am always calm, level headed, in control of my emotions. But I have an ego, like you, like everyone on the planet. Things that trigger me, might not trigger you, and vice versa. And that\u2019s a part of the journey of life, growing and evolving to be our best selves, learning our triggers, while making a ton of mistakes along the way. It\u2019s like you\u2019re telling me not to be an emotionally reactive human, and to not care about the causes I care about. Maybe I didn\u2019t find his comment or the behaviour of the student body harmless. I\u2019m sure there are subjects/issues that trigger you, or get your blood boiling that perhaps wouldn\u2019t cause me to react in the same way. That\u2019s because you\u2019re as unique as I am, we are all on our own lonely journey here with our individual internal blueprints. \n\nBut do you not see importance in our behaviour? If you think it\u2019s important that I possess empathy, and you\u2019re totally right, I absolutely should. But isn\u2019t it just as important for our student body to empathize with the faculty? To realize that they are humans navigating through this pandemic, with a whole lot on their plate. Empathy isn\u2019t something that we should preach and then pick and choose which areas to apply it to. If empathy is something you value then you apply it to all aspects of your life or views. Like I should empathize that this poster is probably a kid, with a bunch of growing and maturing to do. \n\nYou value empathy as we all should but what about gratitude? Being grateful for our educational system that so many people in the world are not so lucky to receive. Just as you called me out for being sarcastic and immature, I felt compelled to call out someone who behaved like an ungrateful, hypocrite. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all a matter of perspective whether or not you find an issue worth defending or arguing about. \n\nWhat about authenticity? Integrity? I\u2019ve tried to keep an open mind through this whole debacle. When I found out exams might be proctored, I said to myself alright, I\u2019m not keen on it but I\u2019ll roll with the punches. I use Google, have a Gmail account, Instagram, my iPhone uses facial recognition, I gave up my rights to privacy long ago, like so many of us, so I refuse to jump on this bandwagon by signing petitions, reaching out to news stations or giving my profs a hard time. I\u2019m aware though, that there are individuals that are hardcore in maintaining their personal and online privacy. I know there are also students with genuine financial concerns, mental or learning disorders that cause them to underperform during exams. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to jump on their backs and use their problems as our own excuse or answers to laziness and neglect. If you\u2019re going to fight for the rights of students, be fucking real. Don\u2019t pretend you care when really you\u2019ve been watching Netflix and masturbating all day and night. You know the expression one bad apple spoils the bunch? It just makes those that actually are less fortunate or who care for their privacy lose credibility.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI want to apply for a study permit at port of entry at the Montreal YUL Airport. I am an US Citizen.\n\nHow strict are they there? I was trying to read other reddit posts but they are years old and there were different rules back then.\n\nDo they ask about proof of housing? Or why entering Canada in June? (I will come only for one week to apply for the study permit and visit the open visits at school, then actually move to Montreal towards August just before school starts)\n\nAlso, is it okay if I live with a friend during my study time? Is it mandatory to rent a place or live in a dorm? Do they care if the friend is a girl or a boy?\n\nAs long as I make my friend write a sort of statement signed about me cohousing with them, is it fine?\n\nI apologize for the questions, it's pretty stressful.",

            "comment": "For entering in June, just make sure you have the return info plane ticket etc for the next week. I\u2019m pretty sure you can only enter for studies like 60 days before school begins and they may be annoying and think you are trying to just come early, but if you show you actually are leaving in a week it doesn\u2019t matter, because you will be leaving in a week and will have proof. \nThey don\u2019t care if you live in dorms, or rent or if your friend is a boy or a girl. \nI entered in 2020, and had to show proof of where I was going but only because of quarantine and even then they accepted a letter from my roommate saying I was subletting from them. \n\nMain things are really that I brought\n-CAQ\n-Bank Statements for past 3 months \n-Showing you will get financial aid for US gov\n-A letter from who ever stating financial support while you are in studies\n-Bank Statements for past three months from person in letter\n-Acceptance letter from University \n\nThey are the same level of strict as other countries but is easier because we don\u2019t need biometrics done and don\u2019t need to show English proficiency.",

Like i have no reason to stay after because my whole family lives in america, but i don\u2019t know if this reason is strong enough for the officer",

If your program wasn\u2019t allowed you would not be eligible for a CAQ anyway. They did not ask me about my plans for leaving when I graduated, and if they did, it was a completely insignificant amount of conversation that I can\u2019t remember it.",

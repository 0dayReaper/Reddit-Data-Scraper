    "postText": "As an incoming internation student in Comp Eng (also enrolled in the ECP program),  I have absolutely 0 clue on which professor or instructor's class to choose. Many of the classes also have staff listed on the instructor list. What does that mean??? And how do I know which prof's class will be better and which to choose? Is there a website or a list of reviews to check? I'm so lost.\n\nFor example, in Math 203, there are classes by Chantal David and Ben Hersey, others are staff. Math 204 has Hamid Pezeshk and staff. Chem 205 has Cerrie Rogers, Georges Denes and staff. Phys 204 has Laszlo Kalman and staff. Which prof's should I choose?\n\nDefinitely in need of expert advice. TT",

I personally never had any issues but then again I am a white male. If you are worried about safety, the security has a service that they can walk you to the metro if you request it. Might be useful for really late nights.",

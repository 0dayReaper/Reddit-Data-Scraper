    "postText": "How many people would back up writing a letter to Concordia about campus safety?\n\nI have consistently been seeing posts about aggressive homeless people harassing students. I understand that mental health, housing and shelters are the larger issue at hand which may lead to these on campus issues but as a woman, I do not feel very safe on or around campus past a certain time. \n\nWhether its being harassed or yelled at by a mentally ill person, finding needles in the bathrooms, etc. I think we deserve basic safety on campus and the entry point through the metro and the major entries of JMSB, Hall and the Library should require our student card to be accessed. McGill does that for access to certain buildings past 6 pm and they don't have a metro access so if anyone that is causing disturbances enters the campus, they would necessarily pass by a security desk. I have been to the McGill library many times to study with friends that attend McGill and I have never seen a homeless person/mentally ill person causing disturbances on campus, the bathrooms are always decently clean, etc. And also, they don't have 10000 questionable stains on their library chairs and the library is actually clean. \n\nI was wondering if more people shared this opinion?",

I\u2019ve see them more often everywhere on campus. Part of this I think reflects aspects that are out of our control, and reflect poor social infrastructure from Montreal. \n\nAs for the needles...concordia should maybe have safe needle disposal boxes in bathrooms. \n\nThere are bathrooms that require ID scan to get in on campus.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place to study that feels clean and secure. try the grey nuns reading room. You must take your shoes off to enter the room (you can bring slippers), I find it is always very quiet and clean because of this. Additionally, an ID is required at a turnstile to get in.",

Well the whole downtown. Speaking as someone who lived downtown for a while and has been using the campus for over 15 years, it has gotten much much worse. Not just on campus, in the metro, on the streets, etc. But at Concordia,  call me crazy but one should feel safe. As for police presence.... oh boy.

Not to mention the lack of basic safety. I know some of these ppl myt not be harmful but there have been so many instances where things have got out of hand. You cannot dismiss this as students simply complaining and being priviledged, I think it's very unfair for you to say that and judge ppl for wanting solutions. Its not as if we invite homeless people to our homes simply because they have no where else to go.",

As mentioned in my post, I am aware there is a larger issue at hand (now I don't know if you even properly read what I said) but that doesn't mean students have to tolerate being harassed and yelled at by mentally ill people. \n\nAdditionally, my idea about requiring card scanning would reduce the amount of non-Concordia students who come to the library and cause more disturbances. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with homeless people using the bathroom and the facilities. My issue is the mentally ill ones who harass and yell at students in the facilities which causes many to feel unsafe especially since many are on drugs and mentally unstable and easily triggered. Just earlier this week, there were posts about homeless people on crack having tents up in the JMSB staircases, another situation where a student was harassed by a mentally ill homeless person in the bathroom, etc.",

I\u2019ve been to Mcgills library too and I hate that library, especially those orange dividers and those weird lights that only turn on wherever u r standing. The bathrooms are cleaner there but other than that most Mcgill students actually come to Concordia to study. I\u2019ve met quite a few Mcgill students at the Concordia library and all my friends who go to Mcgill refuse to study at their own library so they come to Concordia all the time. I think the problem is more that a lot of ppl who are not Concordia students, but different university students use the Concordia library. Sadly not all of them r respectful. That\u2019s been more what I\u2019ve seen throughout the years but I do agree there are a lot of homeless ppl around on the base floor.",

Some parts of their library have separate lightbulbs per step u take. Everything else around you is pitch black. The light will only turn on when u stand directly underneath it and the light behind u will turn off once u take another step. It\u2019s like a very old spotlight system. It\u2019s a rly weird mechanism that I don\u2019t rly know how to explain. Those lights r located between the bookshelves mostly. So if u r looking for a book it can become quite tedious. I haven\u2019t been there in about a year now but I will never forget how creepy it was. U r surrounded by darkness with only one light shining above u and u can\u2019t see in front or behind u unless u take another step.",

Write a letter to Val\u00e9rie Plante, or Fran\u00e7ois Legault, or heck, even Justin Trudeau. Make it public and give it to all the news outlets. Ask them to solve this crisis, in a systematic and central way, in a way that would (hopefully) also assist the homeless people who are struggling A LOT.

If it's election season talk to some people running and maybe write a piece for The Link to bring awareness to it. It's a big complex issue that can't be solved at the campus level but measures can and should still be taken to improve student's safety while they're inside the school.\r  \n\r  \nThere's been a shift in recent years with many activists and advocates (some even in this thread) for a kinder and more compassionate approach to homeless drug addicts which sounds great in theory but we're now seeing the side effects of that right across North America. Lots of cities have been pushing for decrim but unlike Portugal there's no enforcement mechanism here, no push to get people off the streets and into treatment or psychiatric facilities for those who can't live in society on their own. Instead it's just giving them excuses to continue their anti-social behaviours because as addicts it's \"not their fault\". Like this [guy](https://www.cheknews.ca/37-year-old-sentenced-for-throwing-brick-at-pregnant-mother-in-nanaimo-1144141/) in BC with over 110 convictions who was just released with time served after throwing a brick at a pregnant woman. Best way to prevent overdoses is to get people off the drugs in the first place, not enable them to continue with free \"safe\" drugs and a spot on the public sidewalk for their tent.\n\nAnyway don't let anyone gaslight you into thinking your concerns aren't valid or that the needs of the drug addicts to shoot up in the bathrooms or harass people on school property should take priority over your safety. They either do not have your interests at heart or are not aware of how bad it's gotten. It was not like this when I was there 15 years ago, there were still incidents but it sounds like it's much, much worse now.",

While a lot of the homeless people are harmless, it only takes one in a bad mood and a student in the wrong place/time for things to go wrong. I doubt it takes much money to beef up security (or rather make them useful with stricter policies) and install access control at the doors to lock them at off peak hours but that figure shouldn't even matter in the first place.",

But campus is not a shelter. Not only that, the fact that they are aggressive and do drugs on the campus is what makes it 10x worse. It's absolutely terrible. McGill doesn't have this issue. \n\nSome faculty doors such as the business building etc. require a student card to be scanned to be entered past 6 pm. Their library closes at 12 am. I have been to the McGill campus multiple times and never seen a homeless person laid out or harassing students or doing drugs in the bathroom. Concordia can do better.",

For instance, you got direct metro access (metro being another popular hotspot for homeless people) to SGW, LB, JMSB, and EV building (to name a few). And since Concordia is much more in the downtown core it makes it a much more ideal hotspot for homeless people to congregate near. McGill is much more spread out near the Mountains (higher terrain) which means much less foot traffic than Concordia. These are just a few reasons why I think downtown campuses of Concordia is far more attractive for homeless people in Montreal. Look at Loyola campus for example it's situated in a suburb and has a more \"traditional\" university vibe than the downtown campus does. Loyola also has significantly less issues with homeless trying to get in and use up facilities since less people congregate near there.",

Just one suggestion would be to have a student card or visitor card scanner at the metro entrance that leads to EV, SGW, LB, JMSB. So that on it's own would do a great job at deterring homeless people from accessing the campus.\n\nTo be honest, I do not have an issue with homeless people using the bathroom because I understand it must be extremely difficult for them to find a spot to get their hygiene routine done. But it's the fact that most are on drugs, dirty/destroy chairs in the facilities, mentally unstable and harass students which is the biggest issue. \n\nIt would be great if some of the main entrances had a card scanner at the entrance. Sure, it's a bit of a pain in the ass to always have to scan your card but for a safe and clean campus, I wouldn't mind.",

I agree not everything can be solved at once or by one person or even one institution. I\u2019d love to see more both/ and thinking. Concordia can increase security for now and also advocate as a powerful voice to government to take unhoused people\u2019s needs serious. Us individuals on Reddit can say that student shouldn\u2019t have been treated like that and maybe we need more security as an immediate step and have empathy. If we respond to every situation saying we can\u2019t address the systemic issues, then we never will. I\u2019d love to see more thinking that says, this is our immediate step to address the world as it is, and these are some other steps we want to work on to create a world that could be. I\u2019d love to see this everywhere, it\u2019s not a comment on this one person or one university.

If the guy is really in need of using a washroom, he definitely knows where the other public washrooms are. The person just wanted to scare and make a drama with the OP that's it, and like this guy, most of the homeless people behave like this and it is so much common. Why will I give access to a person whom I don't even know to a private place? And who has patience/time to handle all these actually and how do you even guarantee it's safe to deal with them? If anyone wants to use a washroom and don't know the exact location, they can just go directly to the security and can ask them for help, as simple as that no matter if the person is a homeless or not. They are human beings and yes they can use the washroom but you have to understand it's a university and it should be treated as a protected and restricted area and we need urgent action against all these. Anytime an accident can happen for these people at SGW campus, and this is not the environment you and we are paying for.",

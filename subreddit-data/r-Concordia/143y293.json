All my friends who graduated 1-2 year ago, told me there were so many Indian/ Punjabi people however ever since I came to Concordia i barely saw any.\nI would love to make some punjabi/indian friends but it\u2019s so rare!\nEdited; I\u2019m currently majoring in Finance and it\u2019s been almost 4 semesters and none so far lol!",

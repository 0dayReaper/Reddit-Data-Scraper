    "postText": "I Need some help. I spoke to my advisor and it came to absolutely nothing. I am in conditional standing as of right now in JMSB and I realised that I am in that situation because I hate business. I am trying to transfer now to psychology although I know that with my low GPA it\u2019s impossible as of right now, but there is no advisors in psychology department unless you are already in that degree, and the receptionist on the phone told me that they accept only like once a year for internal degree transfers. And I can\u2019t really take any psych courses because they are reserved for psych students only. So I don\u2019t know if I have to drop all my JMSB courses and if yes what should I take instead of them to raise my GPA and if it will be worth it anyways If they are such a competitive program\u2026",

In order to do anything with the degree you need to be in honours, and in order to be in honours you need to maintain a minimum 3.7 GPA and never receive a grade under a C+.  That said, if you still wish to do it, work on your electives and do not take any 200-level PSYC course except PSYC 200 because the rest won't count towards your degree.",

But I'm not an advisor, nor very familiar with JMSB  so take my advice with a grain of salt. \n\nIf the psyc department sees you are getting decent grades in their courses, and you bring up your GPA, then you might be able to transfer. \n\nAnd remember, the Student Success Center is your friend. They have workshops, handouts, tutorials, tutors, writing help, and everything else that any university students needs to be highly successful. The rest depends on you...",

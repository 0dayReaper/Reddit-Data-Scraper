Students these days can\u2019t help but compare their options for acquiring skills. As they do that more and more the university model will be challenged in the coming years waaaaaay beyond what it is prepared for. \n\nAlso, bear in mind your 6000$ is still a fraction of what it really costs. As a model, Uni has a solid track record for training generations of students, but it is also a very very expensive model.",

I know I am not the first to say this but this semester is KILLING ME... :(\n\nI am in my third year and up until now things have been smooth sailing but holy crap. after this semester, my GPA is going to drop so much. It is just SO HARD to teach myself on a computer alone all day every day with barely any/no support. I keep trying to make a schedule and stick to it but I'm also just like, depressed? I guess? Normally, I am super self-sufficient and motivated but right now....\n\nI don't know what to do. I cannot focus at all. :(\n\nHow is everybody holding up? Does anybody have any tips? I try to eat well and go for walks every day but I just have no energy at all and I'm starting to get really worried about the winter semester...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to circle back and say thanks to everyone for you thoughtful feedback and advice. Reading all of your comments has really helped and made me realize that a lot of people are in a similar situation right now. It is nice to feel supported, even if by strangers on the internet. For anyone who is struggling, there is some really solid advice here. Also, I reached out to Counselling &amp; Psychological services and had my first appointment today; if anybody else is battling depression and anxiety right now their email is [**cps@concordia.ca**](mailto:cps@concordia.ca)**.** We can do this! :)",

So many people just start their day with this unrealistic idea that it\u2019s gonna be the most productive day in history, and that they will complete an insane amount of work. I found when I started setting accurate and realistic goals for what to accomplish in a day, I could  actually accomplish them, which felt really great. Before that I was just disappointed after every day of studying, regardless of how much I actually got done.",

Almost hoping I get the flu so I can take a break. \n\nWorkwise, something that works for me is to take every task I have to do and subdivide it into smaller more manageable chunks.  Then I allocate a date and time to each of those chunks. It doesn't create motivation, but it doesn't burn as much motivation as trying to tackle something straight on. \n\nSomething else that helps is routine: waking up every day at the same time, going for a walk at a given time, having a dedicated time and day for each of your classes (as much as humanly possible), etc. This, however, requires motivation...which may be in short supply. Long term, it does make everything a bit better tho so maybe give it a shot if you can. \n\nAnother thing that I found working from home is that multitasking is a myth that should die. \n\nAs I said, these will in no way solve how you're feeling but they might help meeting deadlines and to do the work. Mental health is another question entirely and I am frankly not in a good position to advise you on this since I am this close to an epic burnout. \n\nGood luck.",

Make your bed and clean your room, the clutter instantly puts you in a bad mood, shower, wear clothes that you would wear outside, that means shoes in the house, trust me it makes a huge difference in your mind when you're in jeans and shoes v/s sweatpants and flip flops. Also, designate a spot in your room/apartment where you cannot have your phone with you or browse the internet, it makes it much easier to study. I found that I would be more motivated to work if I decided I would reward myself with Netflix or any other self-indulgent behavior, only once I completed XYZ! It makes everything so much more satisfying cause there is no more guilt associated with the act. \n\nYou have to literally go to war with yourself, call yourself out when you're being a lazy shit, it's not easy but I'm telling you it's 100% possible if you keep trying!\n\n **I'M ROOTING FOR YOU!**",

    "postText": "So Concordia increased the Student Association Fees after I already paid for summer session 1.  Seems like a weird time to increase Student Association Fees, after students have already paid, but anyways.\n\nI go to Student Center online and it says Past Due: 0.78 so I paid it on May 18th, the normal way that I do with online banking.  However, it still hasn't been updated on my file.  Is there a minimum amount you need to send Concordia for them to process it?\n\nIt's nearing the end of the month and I hope they will not charge a late fee penalty for this.  (Do they count it as a \"late payment\" for when they actually process it, after May 31st, or when you actually send it, if the payment happens to be sent after May 31st?)",

Those who made payments around the long weekend have the same situation, and the payment section of the student centre is not updated yet for those students and university hasn\u2019t received the payments. I talked this afternoon with student accounts office and they told me until the problem is fixed, they are not going to apply late payments/interest on the payments that was made before the deadline. Hope this helps\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",

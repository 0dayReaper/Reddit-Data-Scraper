Almost all my lab reports can be described in a neat and concise paragraph or two with some diagrams, but noooo, all the TAs want me to write a page or two of \"discussion\".

Sometimes I\u2019d be asked or even as far as being used as an example, my only answer is, pretend you\u2019re having a conversation with the person reading? You trynna sound like a depressed 2010 Siri or a human? I highly doubt any normal person would prefer that over a human, yet everyone writes like that lol",

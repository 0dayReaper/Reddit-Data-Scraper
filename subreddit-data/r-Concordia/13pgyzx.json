    "postText": "Hey I\u2019m looking for review material for COMM 220. The class has almost no practice material. I have examples in my notes, and some shitty quizzes on Pearson, that\u2019s it. And believe me the Pearson quizzes are shitty, and won\u2019t be the same format as the actual Concordia exams. Tried emailing the prof if they could upload extra material to practice but with no luck. \n\nIf anyone has past exams, wizeprep sources or anything like that pls post. Would be greatly appreciated. As for wizeprep I have bought crash courses for other classes we can trade possibly, just shoot me a DM.",

Here's my advice from someone who just took comm 220 last semester.\n\n1: Do all the end of chapter problems on Pearson + the quizzes which can be found in the additional resources section\n\n2: Attend the tutorials offered by the school! + do all the problems from the tutorials ( I recommend attending Nathan's sessions if he's still doing them)\n\n3: If you have extra money to spend I recommend doing wizeprep weeklies or at least the crash course. I did the weeklies and found them super helpful!\n\n4: Sign up for a few, if not at least one wizeprep mock exam. I believe its $60 but it also includes a 2 hour recording of how to solve the problems!",

    "postText": "So I got offered a room in Hingston Hall (HB) which is great for Fall since all my classes are in Loyola. But in the winter all my classes are in SGW. Searching for off-campus is lwk difficult rn but it\u2019ll save money and downtown is so much better. Only thing I\u2019m worried of is not being able to make friends living off-campus. My first choice was Grey Nuns and that honestly would\u2019ve been perfect but they\u2019re full. After first year, all my classes are going to be in SGW.",

    "postText": "Pretty sure I just witnessed some form of cheating. Looked like someone who you pay to take your exam for you. There was this one older guy in the exam room. Tall, glasses, wearing a blue baseball cap when he walked in. \n\nWhen it was time to hand in our exams our prof was in our room. Prof asked the guy: \u201cdo I know you from somewhere?\u201d. Dude was pretty witty about it and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, I got a pretty good memory.\u201d Prof took his exam but kept it on the side, guessing to look at it himself and look at the name. Well while there was a line of students handing in their exams, this one girl dropped hers and when the prof wasn\u2019t looking the dude slipped his exam in with the rest of the pile (Pretty smart if I do say so myself). Teacher noticed and chases after the guy. Followed him out of the exam room. I don\u2019t think they caught the guy. Crazy stuff",

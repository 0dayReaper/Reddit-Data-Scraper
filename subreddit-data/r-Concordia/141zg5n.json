            "comment": "I worked in admissions at another Montreal Uni for a few years, so take this with a grain of salt since it\u2019s a different university, but I suppose the same principles could apply at ConU. Oftentimes the minimum required CGPA or R scores or even the average GPA/R score of admitted students is lower than what you actually need in order to be considered during the first few rounds of admissions. This means that you are not guaranteed an offer even if you clear the minimum or hit the target requirements. \n\nPrimary reason is that each faculty maintains an admissions quota and there is a ceiling to how many students they can reasonably admit for various operational reasons. So for example, say History only has room for 300 admits in fall 2023, it could be that the 300th person offered admission had the lowest grades in the accepted cohort at the point of application, and those grades could be a decent amount higher than the posted minimums. For transfer students, I bet the quota is smaller than for new students and the grades of those admitted are probably more competitive. We had admissions cycles where the minimum grade was like a 75% average for a particular faculty, and the average of those admitted was like 90%. \n\nGrade inflation is very real and sometimes incoming cohorts are just really strong and competitive academically. The strength of the application pool will then intersect with how competitive the program or faculty is, which is usually a function of how many spots are available and how many prospective students apply. \n\nThey keep the admissions criteria slightly lower to encourage as many prospective students to apply as possible and pay the application fees. \n\nAll to say that your grades might not be strong enough if the applicant pool is particularly strong/competitive for fall 2023. I recommend that you meet with someone in recruitment to look over your application and see what can be done to improve your odds of admission in future cycle. You can consider taking a few history classes at ConU or McGill as a non-degree student, and then those credits could be transferable to your History program at ConU, so they are not wasted time. Hope it all works out for you.",

You\u2019d be surprised how just one person who reads your message can be willing to fight for you. I went from being denied admission to having one kind lady asking me if I still wanted a spot in the program. So it\u2019s not impossible. Good luck my friend.",

So finished cegep with a 29 R score at Dawson college, got in at UDEM in Art History, and my crohns disease acted up real bad and entered an enormous flare up, had to miss a lot of class, became EXTRA depressed, and ended with F in every single class. I was done with everything. Then, I applied to Concordia, in a program with similar requirements to the one you applied. With my application I actually sent in a letter of motivation explaining what had happened for this to occur. They accepted me with condition of passing every class with at least a B I believe was the condition, if I do so for the first semester, I was officially in. So I did it, got A+ in every class and then had full acceptance in the program. So maybe a situation like that could happen! Good luck!",

My point is that if ur in a program with great writers you'll have to play catch up the whole time, you risk your GPA, and make it harder on yourself. Clearly your track record is not stellar so why bang your head on the wall just pick one of the million other courses of study. \n\nP.s. the career progression in history is academics which....shocker....requires extensive publishing aka really good writing",

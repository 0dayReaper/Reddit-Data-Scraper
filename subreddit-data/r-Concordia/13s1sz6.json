Street parking isn't always easy, but parking lots/garages usually have a spot and will run you $20/day",

Since classes have similar time blocks you have to get there early enough before class to catch spots as staff/students leave from the previous class block\n\nAlternatively, they opened one under the Faubourg building on Guy (it has a sneaky entrance) - same pricing as LB but fewer spots and weird layout\n\nStreet parking you really have to account for search time and get lucky. Also be sure check the countdown on the app during class since the max time is 2hrs\n\nMy last resort is a parking garage just south of Sainte Catherine on MacKay - after 5pm I thinks it\u2019s like 12-14 bucks but has a higher daytime rate IIRC",

    "postText": "Here is my situation. \n\nI am a year 0 student wanting to study mechanical engineering. \nI got in mech eng co op at concordia and civil  eng at McGill with mech still being ready for review. \nI like the co op option for Concordia but is it really all that better than finding internships on your own/will I be fine finding internships at McGill? Work experience is important to me. \nI got into Hingston Hall B which is less than desirable because I\u2019d much rather be downtown. \nI\u2019ve visited Montreal a few times and really like the McGill campus, I visited Concordia\u2019s downtown campus for a little bit and didn\u2019t really love it. I would also be a bit worried about the commute from Loyola to downtown all the time. \nI have heard better things about Concordia\u2019s engineering though\u2026 and who knows if I would be able to transfer to mech at McGill if I don\u2019t end up getting in.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?",

            "comment": "I know this is weird, but sometimes you have to go with a gut instinct on stuff like this. I've been to both schools. The entrance grade requirements for both universities are quite different. McGill is prettier, students are smart/have money and they know it, but it doesn't make them bad people. Concordia students are scrappier in an entrepreneurial way and tend to earn their clout, as opposed to arriving with it. What kind of person do you want to spent time with? So far I love 60% of my engineering profs at Concordia, which I guess is pretty high. I don't know much about the eng department at McGill. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer. Unless you want to be very hireable internationally, then yeah, go to McGill if you got in.\n\nEDIT: I'm not convinced I would have looked for internships on my own had I went to McGill for eng. I would be pretty happy to take some time off from the heavy schoolwork. I like that coop forces me to just do it. If you're the kind of person that is not self-directed in that way, then coop might be good for you. That's actually one of the reasons I ended up choosing Concordia.",

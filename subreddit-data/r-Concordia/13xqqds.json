    "postText": "Registered for 287 for second summer semester, just curious if anyone knows in the past how it's been. Shes got terrible reviews both on here and ratemyprof, and that people say they've gotta teach themselves, which for me isn't too bad, at this point I'm used to it. But does anyone know abt the course structure in the past? like grading scheme, attendance requirements, etc.\n\nAppreciate it",

The class is easy, just don't attend its a waste of time. Learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP from w3schools and look at her notes to make sure you go everything and you'll be golden. It's very easy to learn on your own so you'll be ok.",

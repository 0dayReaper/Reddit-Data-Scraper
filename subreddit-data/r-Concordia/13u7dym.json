I\u2019d recommend coding in Java because that\u2019s the language you\u2019ll probably be mainly using for the first couple of semesters. The tutorial series will most likely include a part about setting up an IDE which will help you understand the basics of one particular development environment. Otherwise, maybe get a basic understanding of discrete math since it is different for calculus and linear algebra if it\u2019s a course you\u2019re taking in the first semester.",

I actually almost died, and I realize I would have spent all this time and energy worrying about abstract things that do not matter, rather than live my life . I try to prioritize living life over school now. I am still getting adjusted to the workload, and sometimes i push myself too hard(I should not have gone to bed at 6:30 am yesterday), but I suggest we all try and prioritize",

I doubt that you\u2019re gonna be kicked out but if you will be, remember that you will get up and you will keep going. So regardless of what will happen, you will make it through. Trust life.

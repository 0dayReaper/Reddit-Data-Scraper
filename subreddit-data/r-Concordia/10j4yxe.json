    "postText": "At around 8:30 pm this Sunday,I was solely sitting on one of the sofas of 2nd floor EV building,a guy approached me and ask me for phone for calling his mom,I told him to go downstairs to get help from security room,he then tried to pull my phone out of my hand and yelling \"give me etc\",I stood up and pull my phone back,apparently I am taller.we stared at each other for a while,I was hoping he will leave since I don't wanna get in big trouble etc.. He then instantly punch my mouth,then fled to the elevator and go downstairs. I asked security for vedio tape they said only police can check it ,then I went to the police station..And there is a guy in front of me who phone got robbed just few minutes ago ..\n\nI can't believe what just to me at the concordia building, I always thought that school is a safe place..\n\nKind of sad,the cop said will come to school to check the cam next week,hope they found something useful.",

You cannot be the instigator, and I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t actually defend yourself before the other person actually demonstrates willingness to harm you. Therefore, the government would probably try to stick it to you if you hit someone who is \u201conly\u201d trying to rob you. Also, you are only able to defend yourself to the point where running away is now a more feasible option. Meaning that, if your opponent is down on the floor, you\u2019re technically supposed to run away. And even if you follow the law to the letter, the court will attempt to prosecute you to the fullest extent of their ability. \n\nRule of thumb is don\u2019t get caught. Investigations rarely lead anywhere.",

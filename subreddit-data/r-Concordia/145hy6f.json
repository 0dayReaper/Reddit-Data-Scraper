    "postText": "I have no idea why this is currently being slept on, but following the latest project on Quebec immigration law, the government is currently accepting comments and suggestions from the public for the next 45 days. If you are interested in immigrating to Quebec with an English-taught degree, it is important to send your comments or suggestions to:\n\nreforme.immigration@mifi.gouv.qc.ca\n\nIf the current suggested project is approved (it seems like it will be), graduates from English-speaking universities such as McGill or Concordia may no longer be eligible to apply for permanent residence in Quebec under the PEQ program. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that your voice is heard by participating in this hearing.\n\nSource: https://www.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/gazette/pdf_encrypte/lois_reglements/2023F/79798.pdf\n\nEDIT: There is actually a 1 year transition period.",

Are there chances my Study permit will not be done and accepted by the start of school (fall 2023 at Concordia)?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going one week to Montreal at the beginning of July, to visit the place where I will live and to the open visits at schools, to get an idea of my classes where they are and talk to advisors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if I will apply online, can I try to apply at the airport as well (poe) and hope they give it to me on the spot that day? Can they refuse my application at the airport because I also applied online? (even if I have no issues paying another 150 and I will have all the documents needed).\n\n  \nI just want to have this done as fast as possible so I don't stress, but also because I am anyways going for a week in Montreal at the beginning of July and I think it would be good if I apply on the spot.",

So \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc I\u2019m not sure if I got lucky or something but most people I know from the us that applied around the same time as me also got it very quickly.\n\nI didn\u2019t do POE so I\u2019m not sure if they would deny you because you\u2019ve already applied online or because you\u2019re too early.",

When it comes to explaining that you will leave canada after you graduate, what were the reasons you gave? \n\nThe only reason i can talk about is my attachment towards my family and how my whole family lives in the US and i would have no reason to stay in canada by myself after i graduate. Is this reason strong enough?",

    "postText": "I\u2019ma go on a rant. wtf is this. they promised us we could do the classes anywhere anytime, yet i have friends back in china waking up at 4am to take a test and are loosing marks for not attending classes at 4:30am. We get no excuse when i comes to technical errors, but as soon as a prof gets one it\u2019s \u201comg uwu sorry i\u2019m new to online school, were all in this together\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d\u201d. I have profs that are so lost, one of them accidentally put a biologie text book in our calculus moodle page???? and it\u2019s still up there??? and some are sending us links to FUCKING YOUTUBE MIT CLASSES. WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??? SO I HAVE TO TURN IS THIS WHOLE ASS ASSIGNMENT EVERY WEEK BUT YOU CANT EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO MAKE UR OWN LECTURES?????? not to mention the profs that dont follow the course outline?? like one outline specified group work wouldn\u2019t be graded, and guess what the prof did. HE GRADED THE FUCKING GROUP WORK. and another prof is teaching chapters that aren\u2019t in the same order as the outline, BUT THE ASSIGMENTS ARE. i\u2019m not saying i expect everything to be perfect, but corona is soon gonna be a year old now.  you would expect better than this. and this isnt coming from a failing student trying to blame the system, no i still have yet to get under 90% on one of my test. but just by listening to my friend\u2019s stories and my own personal experience i feel like they just dont care. they have our money. and now we are stuck. and wtf are student unions up to?? like thanks to the tip on how coffee in the morning will stop me from killing my self, but at this point i\u2019ll just do coke.",

Many of us, however, still have proctored exams -- it is at the professor's discretion. \n\nBoth our unis are fuckin stupid when it comes to handling the crisis. One particular issue does not make up the entirety of the situation. It ain't insignificant, but it isn't everything. I also have profs who are making students in China and other places attend our lectures in the middle of the night because they refuse to record them (I had one prof cite \"privacy concerns\" to a direct question of a Chinese student when asked if it was possible to record lectures for those stuck on the other side of the world). I also have profs who want us to defer to Ted talks and MIT lectures because they don't want to actually teach us material, or profs who spend half a 3hr 18-21h lecture fiddling with the technology and the other half talking so slowly with so many stutters that I want to only watch their recordings at 4x speed, but oops, they give a not-insignificant mark for 'participation', or post a million different things on mycourses that have zero relevance to our actual class and expect us to wade through the dreck and retrieve the useful specks of gold that are supposed to exist somewhere in it all. \n\nAdd on top of that our world famous bureaucratic red tape and it's an absolute nightmare. I still haven't gotten paid for my job assisting lecturers due to a variety of solved and unsolved tech issues combined with the red tape of actually getting the right person to respond and do their job, and I was sent (and accepted) my offer in August. \n\nGrass is greener on the other side, except when it isn't. I don't want to play the oppression game here, I think both unis' handling of the situation is immeasurably terrible, and fighting about who has it worse on Reddit doesn't help anything.",

I emailed the prof and he's like   \n\"I have talked to the course coordinator and other econ 221 course instructors about this issue. Since any connectivity disruptions (slowness/freezing of Moodle) were the same for everybody, it does not really affect the overall performance.\u00a0 It also does not appear that there were significant time constraint issues. So we are not making any adjustments. This holds for everyone in Econ 221.\"  \n\n\nand I'm like, how the fuck is moodle freezing my fault.   \n\n\nOh and I have 2 midterms at the same time for this class and Econ 201 Microeconomics that fall at the same ON A SUNDAY MORNING AT 8 AM .",

I used to do High Sch. in Canada but then I realized I was numerically much higher than literally 98% of students but still had to pay 150 times what Canadian students had to pay for uni tuition. Life is unfair bro. Except when you are EU/Canadian/Australian/American citizen, then you barely realize the shit ton of privilege from a shit document you have",

After 6 months they are saying something is wrong with my fafsa and they can\u2019t calculate it. What do I do??? I\u2019m beyond frustrated trying to email them with the same response. It\u2019s taken from September 2022 to now to tell me something is wrong. Who can I contact",

This is genuinely a yearly thing for me where they fuck up or just don\u2019t do it and then I have to argue with them about taking the late charges off. You need to be on top of them CONSTANTLY. Weekly email funding your education at Concordia about your financial aid. I know a few people have had luck with emailing Judy Lashley directly",

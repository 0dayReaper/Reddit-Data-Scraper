I went to Boites a Lunettes and paid under 200$ for an exam and a pair of glasses. However, I wouldn't say they are the most prestigious place to go, but they are very affordable. The exam was basic and very non-personal. I've been wearing the glasses for over a year now and they still are holding up fine.\n\nBasically you just go there and say you're with Concordia Studentcare and fill out a short form and all is good, you only pay the remainder.",

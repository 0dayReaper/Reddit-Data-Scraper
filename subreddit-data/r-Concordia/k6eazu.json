They still have rent/mortgage/taxes on all their properties. They still need to maintain and heat the buildings (technically more since there's no body heat in the building anymore). They still have professors, TA, admin, researchers, recruiters to salaries to honor. All the grants and equipment they committed to must be paid. They still have licenses to pay....\n\nIn engineering the labs are still happening via lab  TAs. It's not exactly hands on by the students but the equipment is still required and is being used in real time.\n\nThe school already offered online classes through econcordia - and charged more for those classes. \n\nWhere exactly do you think the school is saving money on right now that they could pass the savings down to students via reduced tuition.",

I think that would be great idea. You get the equivalent of the difference vs Qc resident cost as a deduction spread over 10 to 15 years. e.g. if the program costs a quebec resident 20k in tuition and you paid 80k, you would be able to claim a deduction of about $5300 per year for 15 years. I'd even make it non-consecutive to account for people who would choose to work elsewhere for bit (home country/province, other experience). The student gets to recover the cost of tuition, the government provides gets to retain talent long term.",

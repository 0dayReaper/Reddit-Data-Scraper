I'm here to ask for help with my group project.\n\nA bit about me and the project: my major is Business Technology Management. I'm taking this course called COMM210 (Contemporary Business Thinking). in this course, we are asked to write a report regarding a Contemporary Business problem. Our topic is \"How does incorporating renewable energy into the supply chain help the big-box stores (eg: Walmart) reduce the carbon footprint emissions?\" We are asked to interview 10-12 informants who have knowledge/experience in engineering, entrepreneurship, running a business,...\n\nwhat we are gonna do is:\n\n1. write a brief description about your academic background to get to know how familiar u r w the topic (your achievements, projects, theses,...)\n\n2. have you fill out a consent form\n\n3. ask for your answers to around 8 questions\n\nThat's why I'm here looking for some words of wisdom from the experienced people. If you find it interesting, pls leave a comment below and i will dm you. I'd truly appreciate it.\n\nHave a great day guys!",

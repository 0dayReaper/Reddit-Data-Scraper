    "postText": "Hey everyone,\nI'm from Brazil and I''ll be going to Concordia for this Fall term (2023)! I'm currently waiting for my CAQ to be issued so that I can send my application for my study permit. I'm a bit worried with time, since I saw it can take up to 3 months for a study permit to be issued...does anyone know if it usually take less time?\n\nI'm staying 6 months, but I decided to apply for the study permit so that I can possibly have a part time job. If the study permit takes too long is it a good idea to just apply for a TRV?\n\nthankss",

    "postText": "Hi. I\u2019m a CEGEp student and am wondering about the BA compsci program. I know I need Cal 1&amp;2 to get in. But could someone tell me if there are many more math courses in the actual program. I tried to check out the outline but was not successful. I\u2019m having trouble in Cal 1. Actually failed. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an option anymore.",

    "postText": "My name is Benito Im 18 and I just joined BEng Mechanical and will be starting this fall. I'm having quite a hard time finding an accommodation or roommate. I'm a pretty chill kinda guy altho I might be picky in certain things ig. My hobbies include art, anime, music, guitar and some sports like volleyball and badminton. I don't have a very high budget for rent but it would be between $500-$700. So if there is anyone looking for a roommate then please feel free to dm me and we can maybe talk \ud83d\ude0a",

Private rooms are just insane like nearly 2000. Also heard that if ur in dorms it's mandatory to have meal plans altho it's expensive nd the meals are not good",

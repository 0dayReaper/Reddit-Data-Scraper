If it was all true it would have been better by now, the first time we were promised this. Keep a realistic approach this is the long run. This is a pandemic which the world has never faced before. It will take a few years to learn, adapt and then finally get out of it if we are smart enough. This way your emotions aren't played with.\n\nDo things you love doing. Things you always wanted to do. Take it as a time were you can work on yourself and mental development. Like training your mind and body.\n\nMake a schedule for your daily activities. Eating time, work out time (A few sit ups, push ups or anything.), time to watch tv, time to call a friend ...etc this way you stay on track.\n\nGet closer to what matters most to you. Perfect time to learn about religion. \n\nClean out the fake people out of your life they will only make you feel worse.",

                            "comment": "You aren't doubting me :). This is how we learn off of others research. No apologies either. I love conversing with people like you and it helps me learn too whatever you may know I might not. I am going to try to make the post as small but its not going to be short. It goes off topic because you have to see it from the bigger picture.\n\nBefore the pandemic even starting lets say when it first occurred in .... I told my friends as we were chilling guys be ready for this thing called ... it multiplies 3x faster than the flu and much more .... and once its here within a year so and so many people will .... which all aligned with the numbers today. These friends (smart) all laughed and compared it with the flu started to say silly things. I was like okay. A few good months later we were all in a pandemic. How I knew I love international news and this was something big which anyone at that time should have known. I started doing research about it. So if I knew this imagine what all world countries organisations knew. They all had the best opportunity to shut down back then but they didn't and made the public seem like its nothing, some \"organisations\" even went as far as to say its something else. This showed all they cared about was to keep the economy running or something else? (Now I have theories on this but its not fun in short I don't believe but one possibility is that it is manmade and was dropped in a place which was becoming a superpower and they could have genetically modified it and expected it will only infect the people from there and it backfired.) Knowing that Cornoa goes back for centuries 8000 BC and discovered in 1967. People who live around bat caves regularly get it and never was it so strong as it is now. Things down add up in the limited research I have done. Trying to not stray off to much.\n\nThen as the first cases came here. These organisations were lying and anyone who did basic search would know they were. That it will be gone in 3 months blah blah blah herd immunity ...etc They were letting in planes full of covid cases (they knew) which recently was confirmed, cruise ships full of infected people (they knew). At this point variants were already occurring is common logic when a virus leaves it host it learns from its host and becomes stronger. Again only recently they are talking about variants.\n\nThen once we and the rest of the world went into lockdown they promised us vaccines a month away, two months away three months away. To give hope these were all lies when they knew exactly the real estimates the vaccines will be released and its quality (which we don't know today). Even till now organisations are lying that they have so and so vaccines when they didn't or don't .... etc these countries till today are blocking access to one another with vaccines ...etc this is where one begins to think we are just pawns maybe of something bigger?\n\nThe only reason we are in lockdown isn't because people are getting sick. It is because of the overload in the ICUs ... (population control from getting out of hand anarchy)  they could careless if you were sick or not as long as the economy is rolling. Why do you think they gave big businesses the most money, made it difficult for small businesses and skipped direct payments for the public instead. Wouldn't an economy run better if the money was given directly to the public rather than the business to pay the public. Guess what most of these companies pocketed a lot of the money and ....etc off topic again\n\nSo now knowing that throughout the whole timeline we were lied to over and over again. Smaller businesses shut down. Bigger businesses got all their customers and the money. Shows a bigger picture of what may be really going on.\n\nThere are close to 8 billion people on earth. On the latest study conducted for people who got the vaccine. It shows that 1 person who got the vaccine vs 1 who hasn't. It reduces the rate of spread only by 33%. So far these are the actual number. What the vaccines say is up to 60%, up to 80% or 90%. This is a number the company made up for best case scenario. With little to no over watch. We are the lab rats :).\n\nWe don't even know how long the vaccine lasts, does it just stop the symptoms and your body is getting sick or which variants it works against ..etc\n\nEvery time the news talk it sides with the organisations and corps because they run them. Why do you think that instead of interviewing doctors they don't interview virologists? A doctor is not a specialist on viruses. This is because any real virologist if they get on tv will tell them strap your seatbelt for a long ride ahead.\n\nIf SARS took more than a year to contain. COVID 19 will take years at the rate it has grown to now. Right now they aren't even telling people about the ones who got sick are showing signs of holes in their lungs etc.... Which will never be repaired.\n\nUK just recently extended their furlough scheme till September ... why because they know things aren't going to be contained by then. Even though they probably vaccinated way more people than here.\n\nThe rate to which COVID 19 has grown to from hiding it and the super variants spreading ... people not wanting to take vaccines it will take in my opinion 2-5 years hopefully to contain it fully. Contain doesn't meant eradicate. Think of it this way do we really thing 8 billion vaccines can be made ... and lets say we need a new vaccine every year do we think 8 billion vaccines can be made yearly :). Writing it seems like its easy but 8 billion is a lot.\n\nIf you do the research yourself timeline and check the misinformation given out shows something is up. Then if you do the math things don't add up ... So far to me nothing is adding up. Do we really think that oh organisations were dumb enough to not know. We live in a age that before you fart they know you are about to fart :)\n\nStill I am taking the vaccine because risking that is better than risking not having one. It's like I am forced to gamble in two ways and I have to pick one or the other. Then again what if the vaccine only hides the symptoms like tyneol and your body does get sick. Keep in mind all this is being done to keep us out of hospitals so ICUs don't fill up. Even hospitals were and are lying around the world. First they lied about how many patients they had literally caught on tv, then on who actually got sick of covid (because anyone who gets sick of covid gets direct payments funded by \"organisations\".)  ... and the news forget about it its a circus.\n\nOnly person to trust is a real virologist who isn't a nut case. Hopefully this will help you start off your own research.\n\nJust not practical almost 22 million active cases right now. This is after world wide lock down. Vaccinating 8 billion people (will take years). If only one vaccine is required and if not. There is no way 8 billion people can be vaccinated yearly at this point. Then we have no idea if these vaccines work, cover the symptoms and are just the lab rats. Anyone who tells you blah blah blah lol is straight up pumping your head with nothing factual. These vaccines are so fast tracked lets say we are the lab rats and after a few years we will learn from the studies what's the reality of the situation.\n\nWhen you read this post let me know so I can delete it. A lot of people are emotionally attached to fake hope or stuck in some woke culture so I don't want the random downvotes from people who have done negative research :).",

You can do something like 7 am-7:30 (meditating, negative visualization, exercising, walk outside, whatever u want).. 8:00-9:00 am (breakfast and watching youtube), 9:30-4:30 pm (studying - pretend like this is work) 5:00 pm stop studying and do whatever u want, you can practice hobbies or anything really. Otherwise, during midterms and finals, it can get a little stressful but try to always make one day of the week just for relaxing and self care. Also try cleaning up ur diet (instead of eating junk all day, try breaking up your meals into oatmeal for breakfast, chicken and rice for lunch, etc.. rewarding yourself for studying also goes a long way. Call someone close to u during ur breaks and have a good laugh. You can get creative with this since all we really have, truly, is ourselves and only you can give yourself everything. Nobody can save u from ur thoughts or anything else ure struggling with except yourself",

I took the time to work more hours, focus on my portfolio, and my degree might take a couple of extra years to finish, but it's better than wasting 10k this year on zoom university.\n\nHang in there, drink plenty of water, take vitamins, get outside at least once a day- it won't be an eternity :)",

Just because everything is online and you study from home it doesn't mean you always should be studying all the time. That way you'll just wear yourself out. Stay safe and wish you the best.",

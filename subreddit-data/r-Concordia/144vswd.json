They are extremely useful and provide the right difficulty expected for you to solve.  \n\\- If you don't understand something, watch videos of Chemistry Tutor or professor Leonard. If they don't cover what you need then believe me you'll find a golden video if you look deep enough.  \n\\- Write notes of things you probably will forget after you are done with that specific chapter.  \n\n\nGood luck and you got this! :)",

Having done the class twice(first time getting a D+ and the second time getting a B+) I know from experience there is simply too much material to cram for the final, you already need to know most of it. The finals(at least in my opinion) are some of the most difficult I have encountered, going out of there way to design questions you most likely will not have seen and rly test your understanding. All of this to say it won't be easy but after all this and Engr 233 are partially designed to make people fail and weed out students who aren't fully committed to doing the work. Good luck!",

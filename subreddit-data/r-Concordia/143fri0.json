    "postText": "I'm a graduate student. I'm not in co-op.I'm an international student from India. I have applied to nearly 100 companies so far for both summer and fall terms but all went in vain. I have 3 years of experience as a software engineer and I made sure my resume is updated and is in correct format before applying. I have cross checked with a few hiring managers too through linkedin only to be informed that I'm ticking all their boxes but not a suitable hire since I dont have co-op. Recently I got a call for a fullstack position and was rejected for the same reason. Did I make a mistake by not enrolling in a co-op program? I just want to hear out some suggestions. \ud83d\ude4f",

            "comment": "Do you hold a work permit allowing you to work without restriction for any employer during your intended work term (while you are not full-time studying)? This is important to note in your applications as many will assume you don't. \n\nHave your resume reviewed for feedback by as many people as possible. \n\nIn Qu\u00e9bec there is a tax credit which subsidizes up to 40% of wages for co-op students so it's kinda a big deal. Most of the federal subsidies are only for Canadian citizens and permanent residents.",

If you're looking for an internship other than in a *scheduled* break in your program (ie. summer, not fall), you must be a full time student in addition to your internship in order to work under your study permit (good luck finding an employer who will allow that). \n\nCo-op students get an exception because the work term is considered part of the academic program. But your internship plans are just regular work, in the government's view. \n\nYou def made a mistake by not applying to co-op as an international student.",

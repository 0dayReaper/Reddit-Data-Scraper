Honestly the admin probably won't do anything unless the students collectively do something about it like they have in the past with the Quebec student protests in 2012. There's a lot that we as students can still do if we can redirect that anger &amp; frustration toward helping each other collectively.\n\nIf you're interested, there's a student run campaign going on right now where a group of people are pressuring the admin to address their shitty handling of the whole situation.

They will do the minimum, put on a happy/positive mask and say all the clich\u00e9s in the book to keep up the facade of a great school/business/person wtv.. I think what you find frustrating is that they should \"own up\", \"do the right thing\" and that there should be some justice for the damage caused to students mental health and academic careers. Truth is in all aspects of life, there is no \"justice\" and these emotions will chew at you for nothing while they rub it in your face.\n\nIt's cool to vent and discuss it here, I am not saying to not post this or change anything about it. If I'm saying anything is that this should be expected, and to not let it anger you or add problems on your table already full of what we are all going through in some way or another. Protest and make sure that we keep pulling on our end of this infinite tug of war, just don't let it deprecate your personal health. Emotional investment is not necessary to make your point or demand change, and you should focus on things in your control. \n\n\nMarcus Aurelius said it best in his meditations:\n\n&gt; **If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.**\n\nGodspeed.",

I said I was glad to see him because it's very important to clean these desks right now and asked if they are increasing cleaning frequency. He said oh yes, they are doing it much more often now and then explained to me the various merits of different cleaning solutions wrt disinfection. He told me he also worked as a nurse, which is interesting.\n\nOf course this is strictly anecdotal, but it gives me some faith that they are shutting down to do something substantial - ie hire more cleaning staff, implement anti viral protocols, put out the hand sanitizing stations and so on.",

My guess would be that this requires increasing the number of cleaning staff and training them as well as hammering out some kind of schedule for surfaces in classrooms to be disinfected. As I said in my other post, I was encouraged both by seeing a member of the cleaning staff come in with a squeegee for the desks and a big cart full of cleaning solution right after our class, and the conversation I had with him was encouraging to me as well.\n\nAlso they have not put out the promised hand sanitizing stations. I expect they will do this.\n\nOther than that, I am expecting to see some informational posters and perhaps some kind of hotline for students set up.\n\nIt remains to be seen, but I am sure that it wasn't done just because they didn't want to be left out of whatever McGill is doing.\n\nIf anything I expect that all the universities would all be in contact about this, and of course they get marching orders directly from the ministry as well, and we students are not necessarily privy to whatever those are. It is likely that the timing had to do with some directive of that nature.",

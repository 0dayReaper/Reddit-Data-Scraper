I am graduating with a BA Honours in Political Science, considering it falls under Arts and Science I thought the hood was supposed to be light blue? I saw some light blue hoods being handed out as well. Should I contact anyone to double check?",

If there are issues with yours, there will be gown people at the ceremony to assist with issues or to make corrections.

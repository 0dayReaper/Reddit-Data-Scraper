They only extended it to all their classes in this winter because of the pandemic. In normal times, I agree that chosing the S/U option each term would significantly affect your chance getting into grad school. But to choose the option during the pandemic where the university explicitly extended the S/U option to all classes and programs to help it's student would not affect you, because it is first, a university led initiative during special circumstances. Would you please refer me to where mcgill has been upfront about this policy ? This can help people considering McGill as a grad option if it's true\n\nAnd to comment on the comparison you used, of course a student with B or A grade would have an advantage over a student with a PASS grade on the same course. The point of the PASS mark is mainly to avoid the F, D and C mark category where you will for sure more be handicapped vs an A or B student",

With that said, if you\u2019ve got a decent CGPA (3.5+) than you could always draw attention to that and suggest you only took these courses for their practical application in your field. \n\nIf I were to interview you, I\u2019d definitely ask why you picked courses without grades (saying you didn\u2019t know beforehand would be a poor answer imo). So, I\u2019d work on developing a good concise response to this so that you can move the interview to the skills you developed abroad and how it diversified your skill set, etc...\n\nIn my humble opinion, to get into a decent graduate program you need a good CGPA, have done relevant internships/work, gotten involved in student governance, and hopefully have some academic awards. I know that seems like a lot, but that\u2019s not even considered exceptional anymore.  Oh, and if you can get a reference letter from someone well known that\u2019s an ancillary benefit.",

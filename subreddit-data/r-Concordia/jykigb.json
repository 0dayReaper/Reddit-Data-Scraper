Also, Concordia clearly doesn\u2019t give a damn about our concerns (the extra week of break they give us during winter is useless imo since we can\u2019t do shit except getting bored). Once they get pressure from the public/media, they will hopefully cave in and adapt the courses for online.",

I was struggling a lot and reached out on Oct 15th (via cps.info@concordia.ca) and was set up with a triage appointment one week later (on Oct 22nd). Since then, I have had bi-weekly meetings with a counsellor and I have two more scheduled before the holidays. If anyone reading this would like to know more about this process, message me and I will be happy to chat.",

The teacher cancelled classes with a 15 minute warning 3 fucking times. We were supposed to have our final exam next week and final paper in 2 weeks, without any instructions or subject. We've been sending emails to the teacher without any answers. Many of us complained to the program director and dean, they said they would look into it, no news. This morning, there was an update in the Moodle calendar: everything is shifted one week later than planned. The teacher did not even apologize or explain. I was supposed to be done with all my classes by December 3rd, as stated in all my courses syllabus. Now this class is going to end more than 1 week later, but I already told my boss I was available to work from December 7th. I'm fucking panicking.",

Check the Facebook groups, this subreddit, and the numerous people that have criticized the CSU for their lack of progress. I read it over and it really does touch on how many of us feel and it's quite redundant to use those that aren't affected by this situation as an argument because this letter doesn't pertain to them. If you haven't personally felt affected by this pandemic and can operate in an uncertain online learning environment, all the more power to you.",

As if Concordia had any say in the lockdowns, as if theyve ever dealt with such an issue in the past.

You think working 20 hours over time per week since March 2020 is \u201chaving no interest in students well being\u201d? Cry me a fucking river.

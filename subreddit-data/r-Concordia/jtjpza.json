    "postText": "Which situation?\n\nSpending more than 8 hours a day, sitting infront of a screen watching lectures, solving assignments, quizzes, labs and exams etc......we are literally like robots now. \n\nThis is extremely frustrating, harmful and a miserable situation. \nAlmost 1 month left for this semester and we all know how bad this situation is.\n\nProfessors using our \"extra\" time as an excuse to add more work on a course is NOT ACCEPTABLE. \n\nWe don't even have time to take a break !! \nFrom one lecture video to another, same screen, same position, same surrounding walls \ud83e\udd2e, same room, same same sammeeeeeee..... PLEASE..., UNDERSTAND US. \n\nAnd please don't tell me \"we are all in the same boat\", no we are not. \nI refuse to believe that professors are spending the exact same time \"on screen\" like us. Some professors are not even correcting their midterms, rather TAs are doing it for them.\n\nThe main problem is the workload, and the amount of time spending infront of a SCREEN.\n\nWe are all going to have this same ridiculous amount of work load again next semster if they don't decide to reduce it. A week off is not going to help us once the winter semester kicks off.\n\nI am sure this has been raised several times on reddit, but to whom should we send letters ?? Any idea ?? Is anyone listening to us and considering this miserable situation for next semster ?",

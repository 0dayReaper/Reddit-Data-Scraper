I realized that it\u2019s because I don\u2019t like what I am doing, I am not enjoying this. So my next step is that I wanted to transfer to bachelor of science in psychology. I am fixing my grades during my summer term, but I am still curious what do I need to do to be able to transfer to psychology and what should I prepare for.",

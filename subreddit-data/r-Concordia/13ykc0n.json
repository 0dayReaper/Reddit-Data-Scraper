It sucks but at the same time i've been to the lib 4 days per week for the last 2 years and never brought any home and all of my engineering friends who basically live at the library haven't had bed bugs either. So it is a thing, but ive never experienced it.",

Even when on campus I don\u2019t leave my things laying on the floor or around. I suggest you don\u2019t go to the library and try to tough it out and study at home even if it may not be the best for concentration.",

On the rare occasions I go, I make sure to keep everything inside my bag and inspect the chair and table before I take a seat. But even that is not fool-proof so I generally avoid going to the library completely. You should too.",

    "postText": "What tipped me over the edge to make this post? A recent email I received detailing opening up campus in the fall semester reeks of a certain tone-deafness: \"Universities will no longer be subject to physical distancing requirements and masks may become optional\". Now, respect where it's due, it says that this is only if \"public health conditions remain stable\", but unfortunately not everyone wants to be a part of a live-action epidemic model. *Especially* during such a pivotal point in time with a more dangerous variant of COVID is surging and spreading even to vaccinated people, which could just as well mutate further. And, I'm sure everyone is familiar with this argument already, but people tend to forget that the long-term side effects are still highly unknown and could also get worse with further mutations.\n\nFor these reasons and more, forcing a primarily in-person semester does not seem right to me, but to be completely fair, forcing it to be entirely virtual at this stage in the game doesn't seem like the right thing to do, either. But this is where another gripe of mine comes in: both types of people can *easily* be satisfied. Why can't lectures be recorded and/or streamed to students who prefer remaining virtual, but still remain held in-person for those who would like to attend? This is Concordia, a school I was excited to transfer to specifically because of how much they appeared to value technology and innovation. Surely this is *well* within reach with the technology we have available to us today?\n\nIf you have problems with this idea, I'm almost entirely sure there are reasonable solutions if the right people think through it hard enough. One example: if your problem is with exam-rigging, I would support keeping exams that need it in-person (obviously with health measures in place). I would much rather need to gather somewhere *one time* than get together with the same individuals a couple of times every week, for a virus that can take multiple days to show, or not even show at all, all while university officials are playing with the idea of making masks optional. (and, side note, most of them are probably making these decisions from a place of their own choosing: be it on campus because they are comfortable with that choice, or the safety of their own homes\u2014shouldn't we ask ourselves why this is a luxury that only they can enjoy?)\n\nEdit: for those interested, I was directed to a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/concordia-university-allow-concordia-students-to-choose-how-they-attend-lectures-by-offering-hybrid-learning?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=4b310b30-882d-11e6-85e3-cd90f0be5f57) that seems to recognize this same problem and points to pretty much the same solution!

We need to start embracing technology that's right there, which can not only benefit so many, but in COVID-times actually keep others safe.",

But do consider the value of in-person learning for discussion-based degrees, theory based studies, and in general for students who require in-person settings to learn effectively. Things like theology, philosophy, and language classes almost all require, or at the very least are added to by in-class discussion. Studies have shown online interactions won\u2019t always act as full substitutes, and you can\u2019t tell me you get anything more out of breakout rooms than in-person groups. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. In-person classes can be flops too. In-person groups can suck too. But I would\u2019ve had a shit time with my degree if it weren\u2019t for in-person debate and discussion. I know for a fact that I don\u2019t retain information well without being in person and that I procrastinate dramatically worse without the \u2018social\u2019 self responsibility that I give myself when I consider the expectations of professors in person. \n\nIt may seem silly to you, and it may not apply to you, and that\u2019s okay. If you believe you\u2019re just self-teaching, I\u2019d sincerely encourage finding the cheapest school to get a degree in your field from, because if the only value is the piece of paper, paying for \u2018good\u2019 or even \u2018mediocre\u2019 faculty is a waste of your skills. That\u2019s not spite or negativity, I just think it\u2019d be smart af to beat the system. Online only degrees exist, and there are also successful people who know their stuff and don\u2019t have degrees. Unfortunately us who have no choice but to learn in person are stuck with choosing to postpone education, or make an educated decision about the risks, get vaccinated, and show up to institutions who offer it.",

I'm in philosophy myself, so this all hits very close to home. While I understand and highly appreciate the value in-person learning brings, one thing I *do* value and appreciate over that is the ability to make choices and do what I believe is best for myself.\n\nNow, ostensibly Concordia isn't taking that away, but in reality I have two options: drop out for a semester (which I really, really didn't want to do), or be forced into this arrangement which I had no say in the creation of. So while those two options are what it will likely come down to, I am putting conscious effort into having some better, third alternative come to fruition before the semester starts. But obviously there is no guarantee that will work.\n\nMy problem with what Concordia is doing this semester is not that it's opening up, I get that it needs to, and that it has very real value. My problem is with the fact that Concordia is essentially forcing that single solution on to almost every student, while what some consider to be a real threat is still very much on the loose.\n\n(Side note, I also feel that this is simply holding Concordia to what they claim to be their values: on their 'About' page they clearly state that they are a \"next-generation university, continually reimagining the future of higher education\"\u2014how is embracing technology in a way that gives students the ability to learn virtually, at the very least during a pandemic, not in line with this statement?)",

ATM theyre borrowing track from.. i think CN? that was otherwise never intended for regular passenger service as it is being used for, well, whatever CN normally does. I think that's why there's such a restriction on what trains can use it and how many. The original plan i think was worse, to have every train end at ahuntsic (since there's no other way to gc) and then let people experiment with the arts of teleportation to go the rest of the way downtown XD\n\nPrior to the mont royal tunnel closing, every train used to go to gare centrale because the tunnel (and related section of rail) was actually owned by exo iirc. Even if it wasnt, then whatever agreement was made allowed exo to use the tunnel and tracks full time for the DM and MA lines.\n\n&gt; However, if you can, catch the Mascouche (MA) line from Ahunstic\n\nAs far as me catching the MA line that's a complete impossibility, i have to go wayyy out of my way to do so (i live within walking distance from the roxboro pierrefonds station of the old DM line, ahuntsic train station for me is a massive detour). From what i can tell the MA line really can only benefit people who live in the east end of montreal, and a bit \"north\" as otherwise theyd be too far from the line to benefit (ofc repentigny/terrebonne/mascouche people have to take it though that was always the case for them)\n\nI already checked my options for the VH line and even then, i would first lose a lot of time getting to the train line, and on top of that i cant even take it all the time (itll only be useful for my two 8am classes and for one or two afternoons where i finish on time with the schedule. I dont remember if the MA line has better scheduling or not, but i would assume it doesnt since prior to covid VH was the next most taken line after DM.",

Now, obviously, no idea is perfect for everyone, but this one seeks to use two very different approaches in response to the two diametrically opposed sides (and their respective beliefs) that seem to have emerged in terms of attitudes towards COVID.\n\nWho I *really* wouldn't want to be in this scenario are Concordia's backend engineers, lol. The brunt of technological work would be on them to develop a simple and intuitive system that profs barely even notice is there, which can easily record and/or livestream classes with the press of a button (I am a fan of livestreaming personally simply because there's still a schedule aspect to it, and I imagine you'd be able to participate live via a discussion/question board that the prof could see, but recordings can be more accessible for some people too). If any rogue issues arise, I assume that Concordia's tech support would be able to step in pretty quickly.\n\nAs for working with groups, I could imagine group chats and discussions could occur either via videochat or text chat rooms, whichever is deemed better. But in terms of optimizing the material, I honestly don't see why there would be a need to any longer. Things needed to be optimized last year because we were all dealing with an unprecedented transition. But going forward, most students now have experience in both virtual classrooms and in-person classrooms. So, in this hypothetical idea, because students have the choice to pick what they believe works best for them, I don't think they would need any further optimization because they already know ahead of time what they're getting into (and, if it doesn't work for them, they will have the option to switch!).\n\nI think too many choices can be paralyzing, but not enough choices can be restrictive.",

If a camera were to be installed in every single classroom, and every classroom is assigned an access code to enable the live feed to be watched, then any student who either cannot, or doesn't want to, attend class in person, can watch the feed, and ask questions in class.

I'm not wanting to force a single solution on all students, much like what the school is actually trying to do. Concordia *does* have some say in how they handle the coming transition, and in reality they can do whatever they want to **so long as it's within the restrictions/guidelines set by public health officials**. Giving students the choice between in-person or virtual learning is well within Concordia's abilities, even with public health restrictions in place (and *especially* so as they loosen).\n\nThat being said, I do think it's also important and valuable to get the attention of the provincial government on this matter as well. But they would not be the ones dealing with setting up the technological infrastructure necessary for such a change\u2014Concordia is. And, as someone else pointed out, McGill already has a similar system in place; it had nothing to do with them being told what to do by the provincial gov't. That is why I've directed this post to Concordia.\n\nIf some of us students aren't impressed with the way this situation is being addressed, why shouldn't we be allowed to voice our concerns or lack of approval?

Looking at trends of seconds doses as well as general vaccination trends and models it is realistic to believe 75% double doses will be hit early September.\n\nEdit- I was giving Quebec data. For Montreal itself as of aug 9th the age cohort 18-29 is at 79% for first doses. Combining models and booked second doses it is almost guaranteed we will hit 75% by sep 1st. Even better!!",

Given that all the may June vaccines were booked for end of august back when we had little vaccine and we\u2019re doing 4 months between doses and the website crashing to move your appointment up sooner it is super likely that we will hit that threshold. The models all say our age group will be double dosed at 75% by September 13 given all pre booked appointments and the known percentage that don\u2019t show up for appointments. Sure I\u2019m optimistic saying September 1st but the data and science isn\u2019t far off.",

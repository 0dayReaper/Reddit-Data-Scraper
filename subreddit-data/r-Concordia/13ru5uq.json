    "postText": "McGill's Collective for Gender Equality launched a [petition](https://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-10089/index.html) to combat the threat of date-rape drugs, which will be deposited at the National Assembly of Quebec. Please consider signing, especially if you plan on going out this summer.\n\nTo sign:\n\n1. follow this [link](https://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/exprimez-votre-opinion/petition/Petition-10089/index.html)\n2. fill out the signature section at the bottom of the petition\n3. click the link sent to your email to confirm your signature (it\u2019s from the National Assembly of Quebec, so it\u2019s secure)\n\nThe petition asks the provincial government to ensure access to drug screenings in suspected drugging cases (while some women have been denied tests in the past) and to provide more free safeguards in vulnerable areas (e.g., bars, clubs, music festivals.) This could include drug indicators, which change in colour if a drink is spiked.\n\nIt only takes a few seconds to sign and contributes to a safer environment for all of us. University students are among the most vulnerable demographic when it comes to date-rape drugs, especially Concordians since one of the campuses is downtown. There is more info on instagram @/genderequalitymcgill if anyone is interested. Thanks!",

From your main page, it seems that you are only concerned with women and girls when in reality men are also victims of date rape drugs as well. Seems to me that this organization is exclusive to protecting women and doesn't care about the well-being of men.",

During one of the lectures she said something that was completely wrong factually, and I emailed her with sources and she acknowledged my source and said she agreed with the author but then never corrected herself in class. She is seriously biased toward the Israeli side during the palestine-Israel part of the course, which whatever she\u2019s entitled to her beliefs but she literally turned off the chat (again, this was during the pandemic and classes were on zoom) when myself and some other students started to make counter points and said that she didn\u2019t want to create a hostile environment.  I don\u2019t see the point of university if you\u2019re not allowed to debate with your classmates or challenge some of the subject matter. Did not enjoy her course at all. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

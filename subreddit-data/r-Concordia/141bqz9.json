            "comment": "Tl;dr : really bad idea, don\u2019t do it \n\n1. Dept &amp; your prof likely to straight up refuse, they\u2019re heavily monitoring your work so it would be hard to jump ahead. They frequently ask you to change major parts of your capstone as well.\n\n2. You\u2019re under estimating a capstone and the amount of teamwork and deliverables you need to hand in. Even when doing weekly check ins with your prof and your teammates, the amount of work is staggering, there\u2019s a reason it is 8-9 months not 4 months. This is like a thesis project and the research expectations are there for ~4 student\u2019s 8 months of work on various in depth topics related to your subject.\n\n3. This isn\u2019t an individual project, so even if you wanted to do x2 workload (which would translate to much higher tbh) you have to get your other 3-4 capstone teammates on board for that workload.\n\nThose issues aside, if you\u2019re adamant about doing it, the only way I can see it is if you\u2019re doing no classes/1 class in fall, you can try to get the majority of the work all done by end of fall semester. I would talk with someone who recently finished the MECH capstone and ask for all the deliverables instructions, then start doing all of them. You\u2019d likely have to bluff how far along you are to your prof/ in the mid year presentations, and again don\u2019t be surprised if part way through the year they ask you to redo something which may cause you (since you jumped ahead) months of rework.\n\nOver all: extremely do not recommend. You warp your personal schedule and other classes around Capstone not vice versa",

I really enjoy Econ so i planned on staying in BA but I read that having a BComm might be better so I'm really torn. I'm also interested in doing a masters in either economics or finance. Any advice?",

If you want to actually learn some economics do a BA honours, because the real Econ is in 401/403/421/422. \n\nDon\u2019t switch to bcomm Econ. I have no idea why that program exists other than to make money from students that would fail out of finance or BA econ.",

Honestly If you wanna do a masters in Econ probably stick in BA. JMSB will probably prepare you better to go straight into the workforce but if you wanna pursue a masters I think staying in BA is fine. It\u2019s worth reaching out to the guidance councillors for the economics programs to ask the key differences between the programs",

From what I\u2019ve heard from others, Econ can get similar jobs to finance because it\u2019s adjacent, and especially for internships everyone I know from finance and similar fields learn everything they need to know on the internship. So the work experience you build up should make getting a post grad job easier.",

However, Concordia's BA Econ isn't really a good program. \n\nAlso, those master's programs are good options if you just enjoy studying or want to pursue an academic career. They're not really good options for getting a regular job, there's very little added value over a BCOMM bachelor's.",

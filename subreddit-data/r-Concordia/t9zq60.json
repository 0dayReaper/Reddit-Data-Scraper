    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello everyone, enrollment just started, and by now everyone already got their acceptance letter. My first experience with Concordia was ROUGH and really TRIED my mental health. I just wanted to share 9 things I wish I had known before coming to Concordia that would've REALLY helped me. **Key points are highlighted** so you can skim through it (we both know you're not reading all of that lol). The rest is just my jumbled up thoughts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1- Pick your classes for the Summer, Fall and the Winter all at once**. This is common knowledge in Concordia but I found it the hard way Concordia while trying to take Winter courses in the Winter, only to find out everything was already booked. Even if you're not sure pick 5/6 courses and then drop one or two before the DNE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2-** Please **focus during your first year, and beware of the annual GPA assessment**, performing poorly is accepted, performing abysmally will get you kicked out or on probation (which is REALLY a hassle to get out of, if you're an International student it means DEPORTATION and re-applying for a study permit so avoid this situation).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3-** You will have **to get out of your comfort zone** to make friends if you're not living in dorms (which I assume make socializing easier, just a guess).\n\nConcordia (in my experience) is not the easiest place to make friends, the student body is not very cohesive and people run in small groups, which means that if you don't have a group of friends that you've met through work (90 per cent of my friends) or that you knew in CEGEP, you will struggle a little bit to find your people.\n\nIf like me you have the social skills of a lizard, don't feel bad/panick. **Try to put yourself out there to the RIGHT people that YOU want to be friends with, and just be yourself**. Also try to join clubs, some people can go to class, and leave with the phone numbers of half of the class, some others struggle a bit more, clubs can help with that, so please don't be afraid to join clubs no matter how stigmatized they can be (some people I know believe clubs are for socially awkward people which is not true).\n\n**4-** **More often than not it is more about the right teacher more so than the right class,** at least that's my experience. The right teachers like (Tina Rupcic, Daniel Douek, Kimberely Manning) can make certain classes feel  enjoyable and even if you don't have an A you know that you're fighting a fair battle. The wrong ones (E\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* \\*\\*\\*g) can make you feel like you're  climbing Mount Kilimanjaro for a 200 level class that sounded interesting on paper.\n\n**5-** Concordia **requires you to be independent**. This is for non-quebec students specifically, please know that Concordia (and maybe all universities who knows) is not a \"hold your hand\" type of institution, **you're supposed to independently make your way through,** that means figuring out the number and type of credits you need to graduate, your program, how to register, where to find academical/mental health resource. So please **come in ready to pull your own weight.** Don't get me wrong they are advisors and people willing to help, and they will help, they just won't do it for you nor are they supposed to. (Ex: you didn't register on time and didn't get a class that you need that is only offered once a year, it's ON YOU, the advisor can give you alternatives or advice (no pun intended) but it stops there). I find that many CEGEP students come to Concordia already used to this (meaning independently managing themselves, some don't even attend orientation week due to already being familiar with the process of course registering).\n\n**6- There's a tunnel in Guy Concordia** please don't be like me and figure it out 3 weeks after the start of school. Also if you hesitate between A and B when leaving the metro it's ALWAYS B (A is something else).\n\n7. **Don't compare yourself to people.** That goes for graduation dates, number of classes, grades, GPA, social life, we all have our own path in life, obviously look around and be aware of what others are doing to a certain extent, but always focus on your own path, comparision is the enemy of progress and envy is one of the least productive emotions that exist (at least anger can be a source of motivation) envy is just a source of bitterness and self-pity so try to stay away from it.\n\n**8.** Lastly, and most importantly. **Please take care of your mental health.** College means nothing if you're on the LITTERAL edge of sanity. Being a full-time student (plus working for some people, plus always having to figure out some legal paperwork if you're international) can take its toll on someone (add in life and potential triggers) and you can end up being a depressed and haggard 20 something in university. So PLEASE take care of your mental health in the best way you can, I wish I had learned that sooner, it would have saved me a lot of hard times.\n\nGood luck, I hope your first 2 years will be NOTHING like mine (in the best way possible lol) :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I don't know how to count ugh.",

Absolutely this. I'm a transfer from another university, but also have a degree so I'm more or less \"free\" from this mentality now (more or less. It tries to haunt me sometimes, welp.). I have had to counsel younger classmates on how not to worry  since a lot can happen during your time in university -- heck, I nearly took time off for my first degree because of a \\*huge\\* family emergency but didn't in the end. (I also had a relative who was a psychologist at the university help me walk through the cacophony of thoughts I had so I could come to an informed decision, so I was extremely lucky in that regard. I think having \\*someone\\* you know who is familiar with post-secondary or can direct you to someone who can tell you the options possible is key)\n\nIt's also helped me feel way more comfortable knowing how many people in my program are on their own journeys and doing what they can handle each year.  I've also had the opportunity to meet people in my age group (late 20s + early 30s) in various classes with different histories, both academic and personal, that it's eased a lot of my worries I had continuing this second degree.\n\n(EDIT: sorry for the deleted comment; didn't realize there were shortcuts and hit the \"Post Comment\" one by accident somehow!)",

I\u2019ve been in this situation twice and it\u2019s gut wrenching (although my first time was completely my fault and I admitted to it)",

But do you know will happen in this case??",

                            "comment": "My first time was me being caught plagiarizing in a take home exam, this was my fault 100%. I didn\u2019t bother contesting at all so when I spoke with the Dean I didn\u2019t even argue against it and that\u2019s it. As punishment I got a 0 for the exam.\n\nMy second offense was even more gut wrenching because I was actually facing suspension/expulsion. Issue was that I wrote an assignment for my ANTH301 class and the assignment was so well written that my professor believed that someone else wrote it for me. Now see, the professor didn\u2019t have evidence and all he had was a hunch, when I spoke with the student advocacy she checked my paper and ran a plagiarism test which turned out to be 0%, there was no evidence of AI usage (since it was a personal opinion based assignment), and my assignments for other classes all had a high level of English, and the document showed those stats that prove how long I\u2019ve worked on the document and whatnot (after all it was an assignment that was assigned from beginning of January and was due late March). When I heard back from the Dean she dismissed my case and got my grade for ANTH301 like 2 weeks after.\n\nIn your case, I don\u2019t see any wrongdoing. Honestly I just believe it\u2019s absolutely a rubbish reason to get reported to the Dean just because you and your friend studied together. Just make sure that you 2 do not give any dumb answers that could dig the hole even deeper. If you were to get charged as guilty then worst scenario is that you either: 1) Forced to take the exam again, 2) get a warning, 3) grade reduction or 4) a 0 on the exam.",

Even if you technically didn't cheat/collaborate during the exam session, its just really fishy to say that.\n\nBest advice I can give you is to simply not admit to anything, and contact the student advocacy centre for next step, as they are the ones who deal with cases of code of conduct/academic situations",

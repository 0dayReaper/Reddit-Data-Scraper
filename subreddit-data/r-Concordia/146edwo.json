Are there fees as well? I\u2019m trying to budget myself this coming semester and don\u2019t want any surprises when I start.",

            "comment": "FFAR 250-No Supplies needed\n\nDraw 200- Generally speaking look around before buying from Deserres for things. They tend to be more expensive. \nMy prof at the time posted a list of various stores on the island, and online that were more affordable. I don\u2019t know if I still have access to the list but if I find it I will come back. \nSupplies: (Vague list of recollection, because can\u2019t find actual list rn, also will come back if I do find it)\n-Mixed media Sketchbook (min. Maybe 11x14?)\n-Newsprint paper\n-I can\u2019t remember the paper weight, but most people in my class ended up having to buy a large roll of paper and cut it to size for projects that were like 42x32 min requirements \n-HB pencils varying from 6H-6B\n-Charcoal (Hard/Soft)\n-Conte Crayons\n-Rubber Eraser -Gunn Eraser -Scissors \n-Pencil Sharpener -Ruler \n-Ink -Paint brush\n-white chalk\n\nResponse to above comment:\n-I didn\u2019t use brown paper in the course at any point unless they are talking about newsprint which is a greyish brown\n-charcoal was almost never used for sketching\n-sketching pencil thickness doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the hardness/softness that does (size is preference to individual)\n-sketchbook size, there\u2019s a minimum requirement, if you don\u2019t get at least the minimum your grades will suffer, wait to find the minimum needed because you don\u2019t want something less, and don\u2019t want something wildly huger. You have drawings you need to do weekly, smaller paper means less time spent typically and a complete drawing will get you a better grade than a larger not complete one\n-for painting, nothing is provided except solvent, and shared easels that stay in the course room",

There is dispenser for cleaning brushes and jars across from VA 317.\n\u00b7         Brushes for oil i.e. natural hair bristle: round and filbert ( big rather than small)\n\u00b7         Mediums: we will talk about those later but for now, just solvent and paint will do very well.\n\u00b7         Rags, rags, rags\u2026\u2026as important as brushes!!\n*White: Titanium white is bright and opaque, good for covering and repainting a colour while Zinc white is more translucent and good for mixing with colour.\nBlack: Ivory black is dark and neither warm nor cool.",

But overall wait for the course to start. You are going to need a lot of the list until the second half of the year, and each project is different requirements etc, wait for each project, figure out what you want to do, and buy as you go. Don\u2019t waste money on supplies you never end up touching.",

Also just really makes life easier. \nThere is also a storage sale they have at the beginning of the year where they sell the stuff student left behind or abandoned the year before for cheap. I know for painting it was Canvases of various sizes, I can\u2019t remember the drawing stuff.",

Thank you so much for your response...\n\nI will wait for the course outline and materials list so I won't rush to buy them, but I am definitely not looking forward in investing a bunch of money on painting supplies I don't care to use. I'm a simple man that can use the bare minimum while painting. All I really want to use are canvas boards, some brushes, and one palette knife for fixing.\n\nAs for DRAW 200, I really hope they allow small sketchbooks. It's going to be a pain in the ass carrying large sketchpads on public transport and I live very far, so I guess I'll ask the whichever teacher I have if I can bring something smaller.",

Well starting today I\u2019m actually 9 hours ahead so that\u2019s worse, 10pm to 7am. I barely see my family. I barely go out. I do nothing I enjoy. I just work and work and work for nothing. I had a midterm yesterday and thought i did pretty well except for one question. Wrote notes, developed codes, thought I had my shit together. Nope. 51%. Barely passed. Another quiz I studied for, got stuck on the first part and scored a 10% lmaoo. Studying day and night and for what?? Damaging my body, ruining my sleep, my diet... I feel like I\u2019m emotionally in pieces, and completely burnt out. I\u2019m a transfer student and before I transferred to Concordia, I did three years in engineering and had a 3.9 GPA, and was ranked second in my entire program. Now??? LMAO I\u2019ll be lucky to even pass my classes. My first year (Fall 2019-Winter 2020) wasn\u2019t too horrible. But as soon as things went online I just crumbled. I tried taking 2 summer courses, and then just dropped them because they were so shit and I wasn\u2019t getting anything. Started failing the tests and quizzes which started AFTER the DNE deadline, before then I had no clue what I was in for. They rejected my appeal for a refund so that\u2019s 900 CAD gone. Also what the fuck is the point of no partial marks????? We\u2019re just supposed to generate the perfect answer with no errors???? The time limits are also shit. Can\u2019t understand anything from two of my professors because of their accents. One of the TA\u2019s told me my group\u2019s proposal had a mistake, I asked where and he told me to read the textbook. What the absolute shit?????? Do your job??? You ask a professor a question and they tell you to talk the TA and this is what you get lol. And do they actually even care about our current circumstances as students?? Also BS we have to pay for facilities we don\u2019t even use for a whole year. This is all just a fucking mess and they\u2019d better implement the pass/fail notation because I honestly have zero energy left and no will to care about academics at all at this point.",

Has concordia ever reached out to the students to acknowledge how hard this is on us or to put our mental health above our grades? Seriously asking because I dont think they have ever addressed this BS situation even since March. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, I completely feel you and I'm only doing 9 credits this semester. Concordia really doesnt give a shit and I feel it's time to do something about it...",

My gf is also full of assignments, exams, etc.. and she is breaking down. \nI wrote a book about managing your time and studying effectively during the quarantine. I put a lot of work into it so it has researches from scientific studies, advice taken from productivity books, etc... would you need it? I\u2019ll send it to you for free",

I'm unfortunately not as open to venting as you are because I've lived my life with keeping everything to myself in an unhealthy manner. But, as far as what someone online can possibly recommend, I sincerely want you to take a breath, go outside and just take some time for yourself. If you plan on continuing with the semester, and don't think you'll end up doing too well...forget about it and focus on yourself instead of giving the school more of your energy and well-being. If it helps, try therapy or get-together with a friend. I know this may all seem basic and borderline unhelpful but I just want you to know it's okay to omit academic responsibilities for your own mental health. Stay strong!",

I understand Concordia might have had to make hard decisions during the pandemic, but we are currently driving ourselves into a tree.\n\nWe have questionable teachers, and an administration that doesn't seem to have the development of their students at heart. Back in the days, Universities focused on developing passionate professionals with character that were going to keep our world in order while exploring the horizons of chaos. \n\nIf we want to grow a future to be proud of, this has to be fixed. If not, let it fuckin be, and enjoy your shitty teachers, doctors, bus drivers, politicians, cleaners",

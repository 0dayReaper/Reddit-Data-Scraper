I\u2019d rather start with the exercise science courses",

I am also starting the program in the fall but I only need to take some of the science courses so I will try to do most during the summer. If you need to take all the science courses though they recommend that you complete them during the first year of study. Technically you can start stage 1 of exercise science, but you have to complete all science prerequisites before starting stage 3. You also need to take phys204/224 before taking exci351 in stage 2.",

            "comment": "Currently in exercise science I would say take some science pre requisites in your first year like Phys 204 and 224 and Biol 201. I would also recommend taking two of the exercise science courses Kcep 210 and EXCI 252 but each in one of the semesters not together. Don\u2019t try to cram all the science pre requisites into the first year the academic advisor for our program kept forcing me to do that and it was a terrible experience",

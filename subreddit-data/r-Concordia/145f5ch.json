    "postText": "When I first started my studies at Concordia, I was in another program for 2 years before switching to JMSB. I am now in my stage of looking for internships. On my CV, under the education section, do I state the year I started Concordia prior to joining JMSB or should I simply put the year when I switched to JMSB?",

It can also show that you are probably at the end of your degree (as I'm you get a job it can probably be permanent). With the pandemic, you are also \"lucky\" as businesses in general are more understanding about delayed studies.  But if you haven't finished, maybe put the closest like 2020 - current (I guessed the years). Don't just write \"current\" as some suggested, this will look as if you just started your program (or even worse, starting in fall 2023..). Anyway, I'm just giving some advice as I'm an employment assistant, I'm not in JMSB",

Especially since putting dates can initiate questions you don't want to deal with. \n\nListing the two degree programs separately is another way, though that could also raise the question of why you dropped the first one. Depends on whether you can spin that as a positive (ie. education/experience in two different fields) or not.",

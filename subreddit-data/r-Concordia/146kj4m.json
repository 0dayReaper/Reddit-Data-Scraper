    "postText": "I will be entering my 4th year as a Finance major next fall and been contemplating adding a minor in Marketing (which would only be 12 additional credits/1 sem) and I was wondering if it is too late? I only have two electives left (+ 3 FINA courses) and am going on exchange this upcoming Fall 2023 so I'm not sure if I can make a request... I could either switch now, take two marketing courses instead of my remaining electives and possibly take the other two as extra credits? I emailed JMSB about it but I wont get an answer until monday so I thought I could ask :)\n\nAlso, does anyone know the deadline to submit the request form?",

I am a history major and I took 24 credits worth of religious studies courses and I just realized 2 weeks ago that I had accumulated enough for it to qualify as a minor. I had already applied for graduation two weeks prior to that. I just e-mailed the religious studies advisor and asked if it was too late to add a minor, he responded within like an hour and told me that my file had been updated with the added minor!",

All you have to do is talk to the program advisor of the program you want to add. The hard part is to figure out when you will take which courses (not all courses are offered each semester).",

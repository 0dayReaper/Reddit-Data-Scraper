If anyone has taken these courses, could you please let me know your thought about the workload ? Which 2 do you consider the easiest?   \nThank you!",

Both have labs, but all of the work is done in the lab, with nothing to be done at home and handed in afterwards. I took 337 with Despand, which requires a LOT of reading the textbook on your own, so take that into account when balancing your workload. Other than that, I didn't find these two classes to be too much of a drain on my time.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am a newly admitted master's student for Fall 23 admission. I am admitted to the master's in computer science thesis program. I applied as an undergraduate in my senior year.  However, I am graduating in the summer term from my undergraduate school (in July).  So I cannot submit my final undergraduate transcripts before the start of my graduate program which is one of the conditions in the acceptance letter. What should I do now? I know deferring is an option but is there any other way? Is it possible to get a late deadline for submission of transcripts? I will probably be able to get my transcripts in November and the degree will be conferred around December. Can anyone help me? who was in this unfortunate situation? \n\nThanks in advance.",

Most universities accept unofficial transcripts if you're taking courses in the summer as long as they can see that all your courses have been completed along with your final gpa.",

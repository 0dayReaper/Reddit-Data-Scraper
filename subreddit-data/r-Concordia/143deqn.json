    "postText": "I'm a co-op student doing a study abroad Winter 2024 in China. Problem is that the university's academic dates doesn't fit with Concordia's academic dates, the study abroad semester is February-June, finishing a month and a half after Concordia does.\n\nProblem is I am also supposed to have my second internship Summer 2024 which I won't be able to do if I'm only finishing my semester abroad in June.\n\nDo you think it's possible to negotiate the summer off and remain in the institution or am I doomed to dropping out of co-op?\n\nI value my experience in China way more so I would drop co-op before changing the study abroad, but it would be exquisite to have both.",

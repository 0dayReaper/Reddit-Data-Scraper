Are you asking the application of your taken courses to the requirements of your degree? \n\nYou can always propose a change with your advisor. Cook up a different spread of your courses and ask if them if this is a valid spread. If so, request that this be implemented.",

Thank you. I made a spreadsheet but didn\u2019t want to send it over yet without any clarity if asking I\u2019d look like a dick or not \ud83d\ude05",

Be direct and to the point but not demanding or controlling.   \n\n\n\"I saw my current credit spread for the requirements of my degree and would like to propose my own distribution. I have the new sheet attached to this email and was wondering if you had time to look over it and if we could apply my credits in this fashion.\"\n\nSomething to that effect.",

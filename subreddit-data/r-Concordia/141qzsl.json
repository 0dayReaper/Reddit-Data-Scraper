    "postText": "hey guys,\n\nI am a high school student who plans to become an international student at Concordia. I got accepted when I first submitted my grades (bachelor in mechanical engineering). My acceptance is conditional as stated in my acceptance letter and the condition was to keep my general average above 14/20, a Physics average above 14/20 well as math. Unfortunately, my general average might be around 13.6 to 13.8 depending on the semesters' percentages, however, my physics and math grades will remain above 15. what is the chance I get rejected? I've been stressing over it since all my documents are finished and I have already booked my plane ticket.",

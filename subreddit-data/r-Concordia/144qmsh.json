I'm thinking of returning to my hometown for a year for personal reasons and while I'm there I'd want to continue my education and do courses at my local university.  \n\n\nIf I want to transfer back to Concordia in my final year to graduate, can I transfer those credits I took on my year \"off\" back to my JMSB degree?  \n\n\nI heard that you can only transfer credits to JMSB when you are first applying, but since I will be applying again as I will be at a new school for a year, can I transfer those credits too?",

And you need at least 36 credits of your major completed at Concordia.",

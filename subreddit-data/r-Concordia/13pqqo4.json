    "postText": "I recently applied for a part-time loan for my summer courses and was rejected due to \"defaulted loans\". I currently have taken loans out for school for the past few years and have claimed RAP (repayment assistance plan) 3+ times since I'm yet to finish my degree. Anyways, I just want to understand the situation and why defaulted loans was the reason for the rejection - I need to fix it so I can apply for loans for the upcoming fall semester. Does anyone know what defaulted loans mean???",

Are you sure you didn't have a prior loan go to a collections agency due to non-payment?\n\nYou should pull your credit report (Equifax) and see if you have any notes on defaulted loans on there, that will give you the info you need. They give you one free credit report per year.",

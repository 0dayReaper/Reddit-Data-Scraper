    "postText": "My teachers always tell us to use our student email through outlook to contact them. But whenever I do that I almost never get a response. Last semester I emailed a teacher through my student email. Emailed them twice and no response. Then I use my personal email through gmail and I get a response right away. My teacher said in the email to only use my student email, I explained he\u2019s not opening my emails on outlook and he just stops responding to my personal emails because it\u2019s not through outlook \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Had to email another prof last semester and my emails through my student one worked but he got them like 2 weeks after they were sent, like some sort of delay. This summer semester I\u2019m taking a course, emailed the prof almost 7 days ago with no response on my student email. Sent one from my personal gmail last night and I wake up with a response. Anyone else have these problems with their student email?",

Only worked well with one prof out of 4. It could also just be that most profs are very busy and won\u2019t catch all of the emails. And I\u2019m aware certain profs won\u2019t check emails too",

I always do that when sending important assignments. Normally, you\u2019ll get an automatic e-mail a few minutes after sending yours confirming that it has been delivered. If you don\u2019t receive that e-mail, there might be a problem on your end.",

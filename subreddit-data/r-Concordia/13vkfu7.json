    "postText": "Hi, \n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to boost a final grade? Along with math 208 and two other classes I took math 209. I passed every class but got a C+ for Math 209 during the winter 2022 semester. Although a C+ is a passing grade, in order to get into finance I need to get a minimum of B-.\n\nMy grade distribution for the class consists of 9/10 for the assignments, 17.2/100 for the midterm, and as for the final I don't know. The issue is that I worked really hard on over the semester to make sure that I would pass the class with a minimum of B-, I even got private tutoring. It's only when the final came that I struggled. Based on the Concordia website, C+ is only 4% away from a B-. \n\nA lot of students failed the class. In fact, 18 students got an F as a final grade. I tried speaking with my professor to review my exam but told me that he can't do anything. I tried reaching out another math 209 teacher and was told the same thing. I tried reaching out to finance advisors and was told the same thing. Is there a way for me to get a small grade bump for me to get into JSMB without having to redo the class?",

    "postText": "I actually will be coming to Montr\u00e9al on July 11th since the prices for the air tickets were very expensive and I couldn\u2019t get later dates. The prices were $2500+ and there are barely any seats left and I have to catch two flights. I wonder if I\u2019m going to have issues at the border services before they issue me my study permit. It\u2019s less than 60 days before my course starts but not by much. I also have got relatives and I wanted to spend some time with them and learn a bit about the different way of living as well as the entourage before uni starts. I will also be staying with them. However, since it\u2019s a 25hr journey, I\u2019d rather not be informed at the Canadian airport that I\u2019ve come too early and have to go back to my home country. To note that it\u2019s my second time coming to Montr\u00e9al and my first time was on a visitor visa to visit my relatives. I could really use some advice.",

Let's say your expected graduation is August 30, 2025, your visa expiration would be November 30th. This is to ensure that you have ample time to apply for PGWP or finalize your stay in Canada after graduation. However, if you arrive too early, let's say July 15, your 90 days allowance will be reduced or worst, removed.",

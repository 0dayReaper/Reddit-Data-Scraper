    "postText": "I just finished my first year at Concordia and I had under a 2.00 and i\u2019m taking summer courses right now. What are my chances of getting back in for September. I had some personal issues like my family dog passing and a breakup that took a toll first semester as well as adjusting to university. I want to be given a second chance and will improve and do less classes rather than 5 because I need to do better. Any advice ?",

            "comment": "Okay first off, don\u2019t panic. Did you receive an official letter saying you\u2019re in conditional standing? That will outline exactly what you need to do going forward. With conditional standing you have a year to get above 2.0, if you can\u2019t then you\u2019ll be in failed standing and have to wait a whole year before re applying, I believe. \n\nSo, the good news is that you have time to improve! Summer courses go toward the previous two semesters so that will contribute to your grade for first year. \n\nContact your advisor immediately to confirm if you\u2019re in conditional standing and to ask about a better study balance. If you don\u2019t know who that is, log into the student hun/my concordia and their contact info will be listed there. Maybe taking 4 courses instead of 5, or avoiding courses that are emotionally taxing for a semester will give you some space to regroup. As a soci major, I had to take a break from some of the more intense subject matter for a semester bc human rights/exploitation is heavy af. Be strategic and take courses that you know you\u2019ll do great in vs things that are most interesting. For example, don\u2019t take presentation heavy courses if public speaking is difficult for you. \n\nYou have to prove that you\u2019re making an effort. Unfortunately, people go through difficult circumstances everyday so its on you to seek help/accommodations. Unfortunately, a lot of first year courses are there to weed out those who aren\u2019t ready, and prepare those who are. The good news and the bad news is that you\u2019re not unique. Take the time to evaluate if you truly are ready to study. There is absolutely no shame, no matter your answer. \n\nDepending on your major there are writing and maths based tutoring and walk-in help at the student success centre. Find out who the librarian for your dept is. They will be delighted to help you with research, and citation help. \n\nAn advisor will help you determine if any of your courses need to be redone. Sort this out *now* as a first year to avoid complications. You have a faculty advisor AND a department advisor (depending on your field of study.) So if you dont vibe with the first person you see, look into who else can help. For example, the advisor for my minor program is more helpful than my major so I talk to her instead. \n\nIf you need specific disability accommodations, which includes diagnosed anxiety and depression, contact the Access Centre for Students with Disabilities. They can also provide you with numbers for various hotlines and health info. Accommodations last for the entire duration of your studies, once granted. \n\nYou also have access to therapists through school insurance. They paid for 70% of my psychotherapy bills. \n\nIn the future, let your profs know well in advance if life is getting in the way. Most profs are understanding of genuine issues. However, saying you can\u2019t hand something in the night of the due date will get you zero help.\n\nGood luck, and don\u2019t hesitate to message me. I had a rough start too but am thriving now. Walk tall! You\u2019re on your way! \n\nTL;DR Don\u2019t stress, conditional standing is \u00ab\u00a0strike1\u00a0\u00bb meaning you have a year to get above 2.0. You must reach out to seek help immediately. The school helps those who help themselves.",

But you can reapply right away and explain your reasons. Someone I know who went into their failed standing after their first year was allowed to come back in fall and do part time",

Are you doing well in your summer courses? That can also help your gpa. If your dept advisor isnt super helpful, the school has career advisors and they can help you figure out if a different major is a better fit for you",

They had no Readme, hardly 100 lines of actual code, a lot of default Create-React templates, and very few commits. The code repo does not even demonstrate an effective use of Git (they committed redundant files and modules). \n\nThey called the Google visions API once, and that's it. \nBy dubious presentation methods and by misleading the actual amount of work they did, they won the top prize of four macbooks.",

Thanks for mentioning this, because more people have to come up front about these issues. It ruins the experience for all and lowers the value of everybody's work.",

For those of you who don\u2019t know Major League Hacking, we partner with organizers at universities all over the world to host hackathons every week of the year.\n\nA handful of folks have reached out to our team about this issue. We\u2019re actively investigating it, and plan on working with the hackers, organizers, and other involved folks to resolve it. For those who are curious about how we handle these situations, you can read our [cheating guidelines](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/cheating-response.md) and [incident response policies](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/main/incident-response.md). \n\n**At this time, there is no need to submit additional reports regarding this matter** *unless you have new specific information that would be relevant to our team*. If you\u2019d like to reach out to us about a different issue, you\u2019re welcome and encouraged to use incidents@mlh.io and cheating@mlh.io to let our team know what\u2019s going on. \n\n**We\u2019re also asking that everyone be respectful of the hackers who submitted this project while we investigate the situation and resolve any issues.** While we can\u2019t speak to the specifics of the situation here yet, hackathons are meant for folks of all skill levels. Pseudo code, hard coded variables, and all sorts of other best practices may not be present in the work of folks creating a project in 24 hours or less. Again, we can\u2019t speak to the specifics here just yet, but please be respectful to these hackers until we\u2019ve had time to make a decision. \n\nParticularly, if you\u2019re a hacker in our community, you\u2019ll already be familiar with our [Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf) that explicitly states harassment and abuse are never tolerated. While we investigate the allegations, please refrain from reaching out to these hackers directly. You may not intend it to be frightening, but the folks on the other side of this situation are being inundated with messages from people who likely mean well, but are ultimately contributing to the stress of the situation. \n\nThanks for reporting this and we\u2019re working on it right now. We\u2019ll reply back here to close the loop as soon as we can.",

However, we wanted to begin with a reminder to everyone that it\u2019s important to understand a situation before publicly accusing anyone of malicious intent. Our team is always willing to investigate and review issues as they arise, but we prefer to do so in private specifically because of situations like this where public backlash can take over before all the facts are available. \n\n**Code Reviews**\nWe spoke with the organizers to get more specifics on the judging process. In addition to each team being seen at least three times (by separate judges), the organizers did complete a check for dishonest projects (that resulted in disqualifications) for all of the top projects. The organizers provided judges with criteria to follow during the judging process, but it\u2019s important to remember that all hackathon judging is on some level subjective. \n\n**Neural Networks**\nMany folks expressed concerns about this team\u2019s neural networks. There was a neural network that was coded separately from the GitHub repo that has been shared. We have reviewed this code and seen commit timestamps that show it was built throughout the event. They built and trained a custom DNN based on the MobileNetv2 architecture with a custom dataset. The code for it is in a google collab .ipynb file that was not added to the final GitHub repo. The training graph is able to be viewed on the Devpost for those who wish to see more.\n\nThe team\u2019s Devpost also mentions specifically that there were two methods used, and that OCR was used while the NN was low accuracy. The live demos used the OCR to detect the storefront, so that there were more stable predictions. \n\n**Filler Data**\nProjects from a 24 hour hackathon are not meant to be perfect. They typically show a proof of concept. The team originally was using the Google Maps API that had all data points needed, but ended up being limited on API calls. They switched mid event to Geoapify, and placed filler data for some of the data the new API did not provide.  \n\nAs always, please let us know if you have any questions. You can reach our team by emailing cheating@mlh.io or incidents@mlh.io as needed.",

The concern was raised publicly because it was the unspoken view held by many participants after the closing ceremony.\n\nOf course, it's been a week and the .ipynb file has not been released. You must consider our skepticism reasonable. How can the public know that the notebook has higher quality code than what the Github repo contains? Did the judges check that the DNN works as intended? If it works, why no demo?\n\nI will give the team the benefit of the doubt. The truth remains that the team's demo app did not use DNN (in contrast to their claim that OCR is only used when \"DNN yields a low prediction threshold\"), and the team placed undue emphasis on the DNN aspect and exaggerated their work. Claiming they made a DNN but ended up using the OCR-only to demo was underhanded, to say the least\\*. Hackathons are not \"concept\" or \"UI\" competitions, and implementations matter.\n\nIt sounds like the team had a good concept at the beginning, took steps to implement the concept, encountered some difficulties, and ended up covering things up with filler data.\n\n\\* ^(Reminds me of a startup that misled investors by claiming they developed a revolutionary technology but secretly using existing commercial technologies made by other companies.)",

There is no neural network or AI. They didn't train a model or anything of the sort.\n\nAdditionally they are faking the reviews. The reviews are just a random decimal number between 4 and 5. If you look up the business' they are scanning in the demo on google maps, you'll see they aren't right.\n\nEven the phone numbers are fake, you can see in the demo youtube video that the burger king number is 11 digits long (514-834-68610). That is not a valid phone number. If you inspect the code, they literally generate an 8 digit integer and append it to \"514-\". They didn't even fake it right.\n\nAlso, the website is just the business' name with the spaces removed, casted to lower case and \".ca\" appended to the end. Look at the demo video. \"saq.ca\" , \"concordiacl.ca\" , none of those exist.  \n\n\nAll of their claims debunked: https://imgur.com/a/lMXVRqC",

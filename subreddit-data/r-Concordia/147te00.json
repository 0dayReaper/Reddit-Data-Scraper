If you're taking them to get a specialization/honours degree then it's worthwhile. Beyond that, 401 and 403 are marginally more difficult than 301-304 but far more interesting and engaging, and taught by the better profs in the department.\n\n421 is more difficult than 222, but if you really grasped the content of 221 and 222 there's no reason you can't get an A+ in 421.\n\n422 is more akin to 324. Conceptually, expect to grasp very little. But you don't get tested on that, so you just need to understand enough to do the coding projects. I'd say in terms of assessments, 422 is easiest of all 4 but in terms of concepts it's the most advanced.",

Next semester, I'm taking a coding class, and I'll review my regressions knowledge before starting 324.\n\nI'm just doing an econ major, and I'm done with my econ credits. I feel like I didn't learn enough of \"economics\".\nDo you think it's worth it doing a honours or specialization  ?",

You read a lot more papers and get a lot closer to the research than just textbook models and generic PowerPoints.",

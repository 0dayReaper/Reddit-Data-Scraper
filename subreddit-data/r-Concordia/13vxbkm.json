A 200-level course in which a student has obtained a D+ or lower must be repeated before attempting a course for which it is a prerequisite.\n\nYou have taken  MATH 203, so I believe you're in the ECP program. Since MATH 203 is part of your program and it's a 200-level course which is a prerequisite for other courses (e.g. MATH 205), you must repeat MATH 203.\n\nEven though you are able to register for MATH 205, GCS reserves the right to withdraw you from the course.",

    "postText": "Hey Concordians, I just wanted to give out a message of encouragement to all of us since it's our last week! I just want to remind all of you that no matter some of the grades you may have gotten this semester, it does NOT change how valuable of a person you are. Grades are just a measurement of where you're at in your learning journey and sometimes I'd even argue it only measures one's capacity to retain information, but if you're studying right now, and doing your absolute best, you deserve your place and you are doing more than enough. \n\nFor the ones who has had a great time this semester; I'm so proud of you, you only have a week left and then you can rest until next semester. \n\nNow everyone, take care of your mental health and prioritize yourself until next semester and conserve your energy. You got this!",

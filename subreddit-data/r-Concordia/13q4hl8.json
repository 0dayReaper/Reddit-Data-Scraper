    "postText": "Hey, Hi there, \n\nI am an international student from India coming to Canada in September 2023 for my M. Eng. program in Montreal. Recently, I have been seeing news articles detailing the dire situation of international students in finding part-time jobs and increased inflation. And students queueing upto job fairs.\n\nIs the situation that horrible? What advice will you give for a newcomer as me? \n\n\nThank you for your help. \n\nRegards.",

You\u2019ll find a part time in a week or two of searching. \n\nOther than that some people find it kinda difficult to adjust when they first move in cause of the sudden shift in your whole life. But it\u2019ll be fine in a couple of week when you start you school and make friends. \n\nGood luck buddy",

There are tons of job out there for people that want them.\n\nObviously, as a student it probably won't be the best jobs or the best pay but it's still better then nothing.\n\nOver the summer I got an amazing internship that pays pretty well. The downside is that it's like an hour and a half away from.my place, but I still think it's worth it. I just read and listen to music on the public transit and it makes the trip almost fun.\n\nThere are jobs closer to me but I wanted that specific one, so I made the sacrifice. If you are adaptable and hard working you will have no problem what so ever. I believe in you!!! :)",

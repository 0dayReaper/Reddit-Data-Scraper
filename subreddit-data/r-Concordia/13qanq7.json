    "postText": "I'm interested in being a TA in the upcoming fall semester for a MECH class I took in the winter. I mostly studied on my own and didn't really go to lectures so I didn't really talk to the professor, but I'd love to be a tutorial or lab leader. Any advice on having a higher chance on getting the job? Should I email my professor and state my interest? Any CV advice?",

Also, TA positions are given to graduate students as part of their funding. You should look into the collective agreement because I suspect there is something in there about UG not being able to TA.",

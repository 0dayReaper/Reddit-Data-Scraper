    "postText": "Hey everyone,\n\nI hope you're all doing well! I wanted to take a moment to share something that's been on my mind lately. As a shy person, moving to a new country and not having a social support group or network has been quite challenging. It's tough when you're navigating life without that close circle of friends to lean on and have fun with.\n\nSo here's the deal: I'm reaching out to all of you wonderful people in the Montreal area to see if anyone is interested in forming new connections and building friendships.\n\nWhether it's going out to parties, exploring the city, playing video games, or simply hanging out and doing activities, I'm up for it all! I'm eager to meet like-minded individuals who share similar interests. If any of you are organizing events or hangouts and would like to connect, please let me know! I'd be more than happy to join in and meet new people. It doesn't matter what age you are, but preferably I'd love to connect with people who are 20 years old or older. I am a 22-year-old female.\n\nTo the awesome ladies and gents out there who enjoy the same things, feel free to shoot me a DM if you'd like to be friends or connect. I'm open to meeting new people and forming connections. Let's support each other and make the most out of our time here in Montreal!\n\nI'm certain that I'm not the only one who feels this way, especially now during summer!!  So, If you're looking for a new friend and would like to connect, hit me up:) \n\nEDIT: i saw everyone's DMs and i will make sure to reply to each and every one of them. When i get home, ill add everyone\\^",

It was a big hit to my social life when they shut it down.",

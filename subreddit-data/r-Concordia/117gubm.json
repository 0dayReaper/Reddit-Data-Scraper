    "postText": "Anyone else seen this kid in the library playing Andrew Tate videos loud af and doing push ups?\n\nI\u2019m all for youtube videos and pranks. But these are in poor taste. \n\nI was in the library the other day, headphones in, studying for my midterm, and this kid who looks like he\u2019s fresh out of high school, maybe 18 or 19, starts blasting Andrew Tate out of his laptop speakers and asking strangers if they know who it is. A couple people asked him to leave, everything short of directly telling him to fuck off, which eventually he did, but he played some weird anime ass song and stood up, did three push ups and then left.. \n\nI could also see his buddy cheekily trying to hide a camera under a desk in the corner.\n\nI enjoy being a nuisance too sometimes and get the appeal but at least be funny or a tiny bit creative. I\u2019ve talked to people who\u2019ve said they saw him do the same thing at the library on separate occasions.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna be that much of a delinquent at least be smarter about it.",

For that to be true, I think you need to be out of school for like 3-5 years I cannot remember. \n\nI worked around 15 ish hours a week . Loans are capped after 2.5k so that\u2019s good too, if there\u2019s no overpayment you get the rest in bursaries. \nI\u2019m pretty sure thinking back I made maybe 8-12k I am really not sure \n\n\nThey have a calculator tool on their website, let me know if you need help orienting yourself to it. \n\nI\u2019ve also found it extremely helpful to call their help line, or talk with the appointed afe office at your school. They are super knowledgeable about that stuff!",

We make around 10k each with a student job, and it adds up quite okay.",

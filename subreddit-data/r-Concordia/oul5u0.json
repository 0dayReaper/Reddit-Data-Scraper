    "postText": "We're going back to school in-person in September, and I believe it's a good opportunity for the school to implement some of the positive things that came out from remote learning. Notably, recorded lectures and tutorial...\n\nLectures and tutorials should be recorded and posted on Moodle. We have already seen low lecture participation pre-pandemic. Some may have their own personal circumstances for not attending, while others may just not see the value in commuting for a single lecture.\n\nRecorded lectures and tutorials will provide more tools for success to people who may have difficulties attending lectures. Additionally, if you're sick or there's a snow storm, you won't feel obligated to attend lectures (I used to show up very sick at school just to not miss out on lectures).\n\nI personally do not believe Concordia will be able to do it anytime soon, but this only highlights this school's lack of innovation when compared to McGill that has already started recording some classes pre-pandemic.\n\nThat said, if we express our interest in recorded lectures/tutorials as students, I believe that it may happen someday.",

I'm sure that lots of professors would rather record lectures than repeat what they've said in class through emails.\n\nIf a certain professor doesn't want to record, then it's up to the students to discuss with said professor. I don't think it's a big deal if the school doesn't force it.",

And while there's definitely an argument to be made for the benefits of attending class for socializing, group work, etc. I feel like most of us still want that. In addition to everything they learned about how to technically set up recorded lectures, I hope administration also learned how badly students wanted to be in person overall. Recording lectures shouldn't be viewed as a slippery slope to never attending, just a way to accommodate a wider variety of students in different circumstances.",

It\u2019s been a while since doing 201/203, so i don\u2019t remember much. \nWhat were your experiences with 301/303?What profs did you have and do you recommend them?\nAnything would be helpful, thank you!",

I\u2019m doing it intensive so it might be a bit different but the course workload is pretty average. You just have to make sure that your understanding is good as every concepts ends up connecting.\nAs for teachers just make sure that you don\u2019t take Greg Leblanc.",

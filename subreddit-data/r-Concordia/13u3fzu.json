If you can take a physics course or two after those three math courses, that could be good too. I\u2019m also in a three year comp sci program and heard ppl with about your r score get accepted even without the math courses. I thought the competition was fierce for SOEN but ig it\u2019s not.",

Then, if you want too, you can transfer but honestly not worth it. Cs &gt; soen. Less years in school and same job, no permit to pay each year and better salary (no scale to respect for your salary) so it can go up quickly. However, you absolutely need cal 1,2 and linear algebra for computer science.",

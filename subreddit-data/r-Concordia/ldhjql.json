    "postText": "Am I the only who no longer can do this? Having to teach yourself, all day long, in your bedroom, university level education? I spend HOURS a day staring at my screen, suffocating within the four walls of my home. Back in the days when we could still go sit in coffee shops, it was better. We could have a change of scenery. Now? Nothing. I have never disced this many classes in the span of a year. I always think no! You can do this! to later realize i cannot. I feel like a failure when I think about it, because I feel like other people have their shit together, but I\u2019m feeling burnt out, on top of being an essential worker, I have to do these classes, which doesn\u2019t help AT ALL. How are we supposed to have the time? I mean, even if I do find the time, how do I find my motivation? I can\u2019t do this anymore. Am I the only one?",

I tell my students that they should contact me if there is anything I can do to help with the work. I expect and hope that your profs will be understanding. Concordia has resources you can reach out to. You are an essential worker thank you for everything you are doing.",

Communication could definitely help!",

But I think its because I developped a cyberdependance. I started exercising more and taking walks and I feel a lot better. Anyway, I hate my program but I dont know if its because Im always behind or if I truly hate it.",

When you\u2019re home, it\u2019s a lot easier to fall into that pattern, because you\u2019re at good proximity to distractions. I also feel a lot of more tired being at home than I would if I were studying in school and I feel like if the lectures weren\u2019t online, but in person, it would help my attention span a lot. Right now, everything is 10x harder. So I feel that \u201calways behind\u201d feeling. But have you tried looking into programs you\u2019d be more interested in?",

Talking to someone will help - I see my therapist every two weeks and it's very helpful. You are not alone! So many students are going through the same thing right now.

I thought school would be a good way to pass the time during the pandemic when I couldn't hang out with people anyway but needing to do well is another story.

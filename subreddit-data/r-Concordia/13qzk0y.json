    "postText": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nI\u2019m an international student from the states starting in the fall. I currently have an offer for a 2.5 with no washer and dryer but an insanely low rent. I might take it, but the owner is kind of pressuring me to make a decision this week. I really didn\u2019t want to live alone this time (cuz I\u2019ve already left for school once and got a place on my own and hated it). So if anyone knows/has a room for rent or is willing to look for an appartment to rent as coloc lmk before Friday in my dms\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd I wanna do the whole moving out thing right this time.",

But it doesn\u2019t even have a washer and dryer, my last apartment was ironically the same price, same distance from school, and no washer dryer and I HATED IT. So I feel like imma feel like a dumbass if I repeat it just because \u201cit\u2019s the only thing I found\u201d \ud83d\ude14",

(unless there's a bunch waiting for approval) Did you try looking at all the postings with no filters applied? I remember finding some that way (I imagine you signed up for an account on the site since there are only accessible if you have a hojo account.)\n\nThere are some private FB groups for roommate searches, grouped by university. Have you tried those? Good luck! \ud83d\ude23",

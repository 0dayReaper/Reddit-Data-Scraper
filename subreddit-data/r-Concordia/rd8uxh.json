We for example we have about 60kg of payload capacity, and have so far sold about 10kg, and have another 8kg reserved for some medical and engineering science experiments being conducted by the other teams in Space Concordia!\n\nThat top section is actually just fiberglass epoxy, but it's chocolate colour comes from the extremely long post cure to raise its temperature resistance! The rocket goes over 5 times the speed of sound at some point in its flight, and the tip can get a little toasty ^^",

Hard work pays off and we have been hauling ass to raise over $250k to date from endless reaching out to industry partners, grant applications, personal donations  and providing commercial payload capacity!\n\nThis has been an enormous project that has really taught us the true value of a real engineering projects, from concept to completion. Even including raising investments, and making your project financially viable! This is something that is rarely seen in achedemic projects that live purely in the theoretical and never leave the paper.\n\nIt's been a privilege to be able to work on this project, and it has been an uphill battle every step of the way! Were not at the summit yet, but we'll keep pushing! Let's make history, put Concordia on the map, and launch Canada's first liquid rocket to space!",

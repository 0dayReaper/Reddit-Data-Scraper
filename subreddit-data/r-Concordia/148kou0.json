    "postText": "Hello everyone,\n\nQuick question for those already attending Concordia. My son will be attending shortly and we're looking into the meal plans.  He'll be living at Evo and therefore too far away to make the full meal plan worthwhile, so I'm looking at the \"commuter plan\" for occasional uses of the dining hall. Does anyone know what the cost of a meal is in the dining hall if purchased with the commuter pass so we can figure out which amount to buy?\n\n I did a search and found a few posts that unfortunately weren't answered so thought id make a new post with research failing me.\n\nThanks everyone!",

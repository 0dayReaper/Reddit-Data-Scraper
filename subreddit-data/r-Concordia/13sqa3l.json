    "postText": "hi guys.I am coursed based master student. I had accident before exam week and had temprorily loss of consciousness. I couldnt take exam one of my course. but I get another one. I was thinking to drop that course. i was having trouble concentrating and i forget deadline and i missed the chance to drop my course. And the requested for late drop with my medical report but Dr. Shahin Karimidorabati didnt accept my reason and reject my request. So I failed that course. Is there any way to replace to this grade. I asked my advisor Jenny Drapeau that If I take that course will it be replaced. And she said this is not like undergraduate, It will be one zero in my GPA. Is that right? Isnt there any way to replace that grade ?",

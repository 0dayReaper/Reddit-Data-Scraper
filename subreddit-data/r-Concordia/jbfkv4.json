    "postText": "Life was going so well before. Yes some classes were hard, but I always managed. But now this semester I feel like everything is pilling up and I'm mentally running all over the place. I open moodle 10-15 times a day making sure I didn't miss any of my 100000 deadlines, I check my emails twice as much hoping I didn't miss any new \"announcement\". The Library system is a mess, I can't study at home, Professors are narcissistic assholes making our lives harder with impossible to finish exams/quizzes, Gyms are closed ( used to be the only place I could let off some steam, coffeeshops ( that were my alternative to the library) are closed.   \nFuxk this, it's such a mess I don't know what to do anymore. I can't drop out because I need to achieve some sort of financial independence and I'm currently broke af. Life is so hard during this pandemic, I wish the university could be a little more lenient instead of more severe. Fuxk all those entitled profs that can't communicate the information for shit, fuxk the administration for allowing them to do as they please and giving them \"immunity\", and fuxk  covid. No it's not going to be okay, nothing is right now. Especially not the treatment we're receiving. Damn it I'm so sick of this. Sorry for the rant, I just feel the need to let this out. FUXK I feel like punching a wall and crying.  \nCONCORDIA UNIVERSITY STAFF READING THIS : DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TO AVOID SUICIDES AND DROPOUTS",

He also stressed that if we wasted time we wouldn't have time to finish the exam. Spent 1/6th of the exam trying to get access to my resources just for the support on chat to tell me \"follow the instructions\". Now he is blaming the students and trying to find any little option they had to get access to their resources so he is justified in penalizing us for not having the formulas/values.",

A few ideas that might help: 1- create a calendar or list with every single due date on it (I still over check moodle but it has helped mildly) and put It somewhere obvious like a bedroom door or wall. \n2- try an at home workout. Even tho it\u2019s not as satisfying as crushing weights at the gym filling up a backpack with heavy things and still crushing out a few exercises will give you the needed endorphins all the same.\n3- have you tried talking about this/please go ahead and cry about this. This is a fucking hard time, reach out to people, talk about how tired and grumpy you are, cry when you need too. \nSending lots of positive vibes and good luck your way.

Unfortunately Concordia teachers have been acting like snakes, thinking that students now have more free time to do work. One of my last classes had an absolutely heartless bastard who made the procedure for the final exam as hard as possible. One poor guy in the zoom session was on the verge of tears and the prof gave him the most smug looking expression.\n\nAll I can say is, you're halfway there. While it will feel like a mess for the foreseeable future, you're closer now than you've ever been and you can pull this off. Don't let those bastards get the better of you.

We have all been feeling the pressure this semester with all the labs and the extra work they keep giving us. I have 2 tips for you that are kind of unconventional:\n1. If the workload this semester is unfairly high in a class, get together with the students in said class and all send an email complaining to the person responsible. More than 100 students sent a unanimous email to the lab coordinator for Mech 352 for them to reduce our workload a bit. It wasn\u2019t significant but still helped. \n\n2. This is gonna sound crazy but if I were you I would do everything I can regarding assignments while maintaining a healthy balance in my life. I always try this and if I don\u2019t have enough time or no more energy to do something, I know at least I tried my best. I have redone 2 classes and I am confidently telling you that the worst thing that could happen is not as bad as you think. Do your best and don\u2019t worry about the rest. I hope this helps, we\u2019re all in this together \ud83d\ude42",

So let's say that I'm super experienced with everything and navigated some rough times in undergrad (my uni, not in Canada, had 3 strikes, one of each lasted almost 6 months. Oh yeah, and the whole depression and being sexually abused also happened, so there is that).\n\nThis term is being a shit show. I don't remember ever feeling this demotivated. Workload feels higher and with everything going on in a macrolevel, these little bullcrap assignments feel even more a waste of life. If I get COVID and die, I would feel so sorry I spent my last years in school. If a loved-one does, I will feel devastated that I skipped time with them because of this crap that probably won't even land me a job in the end. So it is not only you. It is all of us, young and old, 2-year or 7th. Yet, what else can we do? If it is bad in the job market having an education, imagine what it would be like with only a high school diploma.\n\nThat being said, let me tell you what helps to at least make me feel on control: I have an app called myHomework (android, not sure about iOS) where I add all my stuff. It is pretty simple and you can add from your laptop and have it also synced on your phone as a widget. Also I have a paper planner 2020-2021 where I write what I need to do for each day and evaluate at the end of the day what I managed. More urgent things get priority, and if trivial things get pushed on, I don't really give myself a hard time. You have no idea how much the paper planner helps to just put me in the mood to do junk. Finally, I have been trying a soft Pomodoro study thing from a site called Tomato Timer. The idea is that you work uninterrupted for 25 minutes and take 5 for a break. Then every few sets of 25 you take a 10 min break. Surprisingly, it does help to get stuff done.\n\nOther than that, I don't know what to tell you other than good luck. Don't lose your cool. Find a side thing that you like to do and don't feel guilty for dedicating some time to do. I have been watching Schitt's Creek and it helped a lot to decompress. It is funny :)",

I\u2019m so worried the work is gonna pile up the moment I take a break that I\u2019ve been overworking, so that I can get at least 2 weeks ahead in my courses.  But the work load is so fucking much. I\u2019d been able to get ahead past semesters but this semester is so darn heavy man. I don\u2019t understand why teachers can\u2019t limit themselves.",

I just want to point out one thing tho as a third year aero eng student. For everyone I know in engineering third semester is always THE WORST. Idk why but third semester just gets to you like no other. Everyone I know in eng wanted to drop out and reconsidered their career choice. So hang on there, it gets better (can't say the same about Concordia's response to covid tho).",

I\u2019m a 4th year Aerospace Engineering student, I worked out at the gym, studied in coffee shops and it\u2019s so hard to study from home.\nHowever, I found some techniques to help me stay afloat. I know how hard it can be to be isolated and studying hard classes from home is insane. PLEASE reach out to me, we can talk and I can try to help you. I know exactly how hard it is and I want to make sure you succeed in your degree, even in these conditions",

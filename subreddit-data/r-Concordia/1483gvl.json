    "postText": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm the parent of an out-of-province student who will be starting in Concordia in September. They applied to the university residence for the fall, but we haven't heard anything back yet about whether or not they've got a place. I also can't find a phone number for the housing office, and haven't gotten a response to my email. \n\nDoes anyone know when students will find out if they have a place in residence? Is there a shortage of residence spaces, or is it reasonably easy to get in? And what should we consider as alternatives, if residence is full? \n\n(For what it's worth, my kid is not quite 18 yet, and their classes will be mainly at the Loyola campus, but they'd be fine with living closer to the Sir George campus if necessary). \n\nThanks! ",

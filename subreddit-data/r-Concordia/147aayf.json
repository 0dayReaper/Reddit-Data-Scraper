            "comment": "Call health services concordia to set up an appointment or ask if you can just show up if they still have a triage system (they did a few years ago but idk if pandemic changed anything) \nI went early in the morning and took a number, I spoke with a nurse and then with a GP who ordered some tests, and eventually with a psychiatrist who did an ADHD assessment, I forgot her name but she was great and very careful. Honestly health services concordia helped me a lot, call them tomorrow morning they\u2019ll let you know what to do\nAlso, if you get a diagnosis of adhd or even anxiety / depression (just fyi) ask about acsd concordia, access centre for students with disabilities, they can get you accommodations for your classes",

You go in, you explain your symptoms, and they give you some sheets for you and someone close to fill in (Weiss Symptom Records).  You then schedule a second appointment after, give them the papers, and depending on what you wrote they give you a list of public (free) and private (paid) clinics.  Then it's just cold calling the clinics until one accepts you or puts you onto a waiting list.\n\nOnce accepted this is when the testing and assessments start proper, Concordia is just the middle man and can't actually give you medication or give you an official diagnosis.",

I also got all my prescriptions from the GP at Concordia, Dr. Hallman. All my follow ups were with her as well, but over the phone. I didn\u2019t fill out any paperwork aside from a questionnaire the doctor gave me with questions about anxiety etc. this was 2020",

They should call you back either that day, or the next.\nShe is honestly wonderful. \nI don\u2019t know if they can give you an assessment. I was diagnosed as a youngin, lol However, that being said, if anyone there who can point you in the right direction or provide you with help. She\u2019s the one. \nAlso, expect her to be hours late if you get an appointment with her \ud83d\ude02. She\u2019s very great, but spends so much time with each person that she\u2019s never been on time before.",

There is one psych doc on campus but I believe they deal with emergencies and depression mostly. They\u2019ll refer you to several psychiatrists and then you fill out forms for them and go from there. Probably takes around three months. You could maybe get in sooner if you pay a private clinic. Went through the process in February.",

            "comment": "Concordia cannot give you an assessment to my knowledge, but they can help you get one and get diagnosed. I did it. It's a process that lasts a couple months but it worked out for me.\n\nSelf-diagnosed myself with ADHD in the beginning of the fall. Contacted health services who got me an appointment with a doctor (Dr. Kwon who sadly has retired, loved that man). Told him I absolutely could not afford to be diagnosed at the current pricing (everywhere I looked was between $600 and $2000). He was happy to learn I had RAMQ.\n\nHe referred me to the Libera clinic. It's a clinic run by two McGill psych grads and is completely covered by RAMQ. I'm sure it would be cheap if not free under other coverage. I called and had an appointment at the end of December within 2 weeks of my call.\n\nPsychiatrist essentially tells me he rarely sees a \"slam-dunk\" diagnosis but tells Concordia to put me into first-line medication and assistance, and I was medicated at the end of February.\n\nIt's a long process but I promise you, it's worth it.",

            "comment": "just general fyi stuff, in Quebec most people get \"diagnosed\" with ADHD from family doctor (general practitioner). Proper diagnostic should be with a neuropsychologist where they do a whole cognitive assessment. However, from your need, what Condordia offers is pretty great. It's not worse or better than any other person who got their med/diagnostic by their general clinic (which around 95% of people I know with ADHD got theirs like that).",

            "comment": "Hi! This was all last fall (September 2022). I called the health services clinic, left a voicemail and all that. Make sure you pick up the call when they call you back because otherwise you have to leave another voicemail. I saw a family doctor (Dr. Cheung) and she gave me a few symptoms forms and told me to take a month and think about the things and times when I was experiencing difficulty, as well as talk to my parents about when I was a kid, and then I went back for an appointment. We talked about doing a full assessment, but I told her I couldn't afford it and she said based on what I had told her she was comfortable with writing me a prescription for meds and the form for ACSD. From there I had appointments once a month to adjust med levels until I was comfortable, and now it's every 3 months. She said they don't have a psychiatrist available to do the assessments anymore, but as family medicine doctors they're still able to assess the symptoms and prescribe medication based on that. Overall it took about 2 months to start meds (appointment was a month out, and then the month with the forms). I hope this helps!",

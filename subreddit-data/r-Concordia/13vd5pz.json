    "postText": "I\u2019m a final year computer science undergrad and I got an AGPA of 1.84 for the academic session of summer 2022 - winter 2023. I received an email stating that I am currently in conditional standing. I had three comp sci/general electives that were in the D grade range in that academic session and I didn\u2019t fail any courses. I am not sure how many I should repeat or if taking an approved alternative will count towards credits. I am an international student and the fees are so high fml.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to go ahead in this situation? I\u2019m lost tbh.",

Note that if an elective course is replaced by its approved alternative, it will not be counted as repeat (REPT), and the grades of both courses will count towards the Assessment Grade Point Average (AGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).  \n\nEvery attempt will be made to inform students of the courses selected in writing by August 1 of each year.  You are also encouraged to contact your department advisor to set up an advising appointment after you receive the list of courses to repeat.",

I doubt it because it was never like that before for many years but things do change\n\nCan't graduate without an assessment above 2.0",

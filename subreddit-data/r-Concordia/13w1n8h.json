    "postText": "Sooo, I'm an incoming international student in comp eng. I want to enroll in Phys 205 for the winter semester. There are two offline class options and they are only displaying Prof Ayse Turak and Staff. I checked Ayse Turak on rate my professors website and she has a rating of 2.8 out of 5, apparently she's a prof at McMaster University. The reviews were kinda split. 7 total ratings and 3 were positive, 4 were negative. \n\nI am kind of in a fix rn. Idk if I should just go with Ayse Turak or should I go with staff. Staff's also scary bcz who knows which instructor I'll get. What do you guys think?",

I can't concentrate properly on online lecs smh. \nThank you for the advice, kinda scared but got to know that PHYS 205 is a tough one for sure :\"(",

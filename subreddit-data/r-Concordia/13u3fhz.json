    "postText": "Dear Concordia Community,\n\nWe are conducting an important research study under the guidance of Dr. Guillaume Dumas, focusing on social interactions and their neurological implications. This study employs state-of-the-art electrophysiological technology.\n\nWe are currently seeking individuals who meet the following criteria:\n\n* Age 18 or above\n* Right-handed\n* No psychiatric, neurological, or dermatological disorders\n* Able to use an electronic tablet without any contraindications\n* Fluent in French (as the study will be conducted in French)\n\nParticipants will be required to complete an approximately 3-hour session at the CHU Sainte-Justine research center located in Montreal, Quebec. The session involves a non-verbal interactive task and the use of a NeuroElectrics electrophysiological device.\n\nParticipants will receive a $30 compensation for their time, and parking costs on the day of the visit will be covered.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this valuable research, please contact our Recruitment Manager, Vincent Chamberland, at [**vincent.chamberland.1@umontreal.ca**](mailto:vincent.chamberland.1@umontreal.ca) for further details.\n\nYour participation could make a significant contribution to our understanding of social interactions and their neurological underpinnings. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to the possibility of your involvement in this research endeavor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6isfv50ael2b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b66772831031e835ad3f0405b807fcac7a2c2fef",

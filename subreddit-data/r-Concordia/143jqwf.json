Because right now I only see the total balance due, and I want to wait for my AFE first.",

So you will have to pay more for the course in winter that took its place.\n\nIm 90% sure thats how it works, you can ask the student center in the library to confirm or email them.\n\nThen again you can just check your balance per semester in the student finance account on the student center website.",

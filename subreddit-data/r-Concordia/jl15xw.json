    "postText": "I don't really care if this post gets downvoted to hell or nobody responds. I just need to a place to vent.\n\nJust had my first ever midterm in my first semester of grad school. I thought I was fine, I never once worried about my exam taking capabilities, until today.\n\nSomething about doing an exam at home on a topic Im not too keen about just sent anxiety through my veins. I don't think I did well as a result, now I'm just a mess crying in my bed :/\n\nI feel so alone, I feel so stupid, and just reinforces all the self doubts about my abilities and my motivation to finish.\n\nI have reached out to mental health resources, but they can only do so much, it's all on me at the end of the day.This goddamn pandemic is taking a toll on me. I think I would be enjoying my program a lot more if it was in person, now even talking to a prof or doing an exam seems like a hassle\n\nHas anyone else seen a dramatic drop in their perceived progress/Confidence this this term? I have not interacted with any of my cohort so it's so hard to get a feel :/",

It\u2019s never too late to climb back up. Sometimes everyone just needs a little push. Let me know if you need one.",

Sci team is usually very accommodating... and we do not do any of the proctored shit for our tests and stuff. But even so, being isolated has sent my anxiety through the roof, and caused a kind of lethargy to set in where I don't feel like doing the easiest of things. Concentrating has become hard, and when I do take a test or write an assignment, I am always trying to get to the other side of it as fast as possible. It just makes it hard to produce genuinely good work. My GPA has not suffered so far at all... but every challenge feels like an Everest these days.  \n\n\n\\*sigh\\*",

The exams and the 1001 assignments give me so much anxiety. On top of that they don't even have a reading week for us to catch up on the material. I am so caught up in all this, I barely have time for myself and my confidence has completely gone down the drain. Let's hope things get better.",

It was a sense of solidarity that we all felt and it was comforting. At the very least by doing exams in person you knew that you never had to worry about not being to hand in your exam. Whereas now that's its online we don't even know if being able to submit anything at all. Not having that certainty and assurance drives us mad and don't worry we've all been there and you're not going through it alone. Feel free to PM me anytime :)",

You're in the exam, you're almost shivering,  surprised by what you're seeing and what's happening. It's like a dream. \n\nDon't let it get to you. This is only a battle and not the whole war. You can still come out and make the most of it. Graduate studies was never about the GPA, it's about the experience that you get out of it. This is part of the experience. You've been knocked down. It's okay, you're not invincible. The trick is to get back up. Learn from your mistakes and continue the fight. Find out where you went wrong and try to work on or fix. It's easier said than done. In your place I felt overwhelmed. But it gets better with time. \n\nWith last semester, i kept getting these panic attacks. When things were just not working. I found something that worked for me. Might not be the same exact thing that will work for you. You gotta find your safe zone to gather your thoughts and continue your work. \n\nObviously so many other people have offered to help and I'm extending my hand too. Whenever you want to talk, vent, need some guidance. Hit me up. \n\nI'm not invincible either. But I do have some time on me this semester and definitely wouldn't mind helping you out a little.",

I'm much more anxious and tired and the workload had doubled. I think you should give yourself some credit because we are in a worldwide pandemic and still trying to adapt to the online learning environment. You can always apply for a late withdrawal and tuition reimbursement if you feel like your grades are going to hurt your GPA. I suggest maybe next semester to take fewer classes and reach out to ACSD center for accommodations such as extra time on exams! good luck :)",

My lecturer told us something just after the exam - \"Please don't stress over it students, it's just and exam !\"  \nI think these are some of the kindest words a prof can every utter.  \nI personally don't feel that I've taken an exam unless it's a pen and paper one, I think there will be people who agree to this.  \nThe timer on the exams is so intimidating. It shows how inefficient I've been. Next time you're taking an exam, ignore the timer but dont neglect it haha.",

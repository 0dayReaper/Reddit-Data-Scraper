    "postText": "Hey guys,\n\nSo i'm a concordia student entering his 6th year of studies. I started in winter 2018, but to my great disappointment i'm still in university. I'm an international student and was enrolled in a 4 year ECP program. But it's taken me 2 more extra years and i'm still 12 credits away from graduation. I was supposed to graduate by the end of this summer, but i've managed to make the biggest blunder of my university career so far.\n\nSo due to exremely shitty habits and poor mental health, i managed to really f\\*k up my fall and winter semesters. I have a total of 4 F's -3 F/DNW and one F for fall and winter. They were the worst semesters of my unviersity career so far. And because of that i have to retake those courses this fall. To make matters worse i'm in failed stadning for the first time ever and have to reapply for readmission with very little proof/documents to back up my poor mental health.\n\nI was so close, just 12 credits away from graduation. If i had just passed those 3 courses i would be enjoying the summer right now, excited about graduation. But instead here i'm having anxiety and not getting proper sleep. All my close friends have graudted this summer and they started their prorams 2 semesters after me.  One of them even switched universities and still finished before i did. I can't forgive myself for being such a collossal f\\*k up. All i had to do was get through last exam season, now i have landed myself in the most messed up situation i have ever been. To make matters worse, i'm 25 turning 26. I'm already much older than the people i started with, but still managed to take 2 extra years, not to mention dropping the ball entirely this last year. What's worse is i may not be able to finish my program even if i do get readmitted. I need to renew my CAQ and study permit till next summer, but i'm more than sure they won't grant me an extension on those due to My F grades. I'm applying for late DISCs but i don't know what the chances for those are. \n\nI'm just seeing all the people i knew and studied with, much younger and joined after me graudate. It's a daily reminder of how i've wasted away my life and unviersity years. I;ve never had a single F on my transcript before this. My grades were only B's, C's and D';s but atleast i never failed. I have so much work to get done to clear this up. But i dont see a way out. It feels like i'm being punished.",

            "comment": "Alright, firstly, take a deep breath. Life doesn\u2019t end for you here. Sure your university career is in trouble, and you need to accept that. Some people just don\u2019t find it easy. But this doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, or even a failure. If I saw you on the street, I wouldn\u2019t see \u201ca failure\u201d, I would just see a person. The same person whether you passed or failed. You can\u2019t let this thing define you. At some point you WILL have to forgive yourself. 5 years from now I have faith that it will happen and you will be living some completely different life. I\u2019d like you to imagine that for a minute.\n\nI was once in your shoes. I get the age thing. I\u2019m 30 years old and I\u2019m just now in my last semester. I was very unhappy during my cegep years. First semester I had straight 90s across the board, second semester my average was below 60, and third and fourth it was below 30. I totally fell off the rails. I dropped out and worked for a year, then rejoined another cegep and continued, all while lying to my father that things were better and I was close to finishing. They weren\u2019t. And I wasn\u2019t. I failed again for another few semesters before they kicked me out.\n\nBut you know what? My life went on. I got a job somewhere else and never looked back. Here I am 6 years later with 1 (soon to be 2) degrees and life has never been better.\n\nYou are going through some dark times. They will be tough, there is no doubt about that. But if you learn to forgive yourself and keep pushing forward, if you don\u2019t let this bring you down and choose what\u2019s best for you given \u201cwhat is\u201d and not what \u201ccould have been\u201d, you will recover and become much stronger and much more successful than you could have ever been.",

    "postText": "I know times are rough right now, especially towards the end of the semester, but just try to realize that any assignment or project you need to do is very minor in the grand scheme of things. \n\nIt's not a big deal if your GPA takes a hit, it's not even a big deal if you fail a course. Try to realize that in a few months from now you'll look back at your current self and laugh at how stressed out you were over nothing.\n\nI know schoolwork might seem important now, but really nothing you do at uni is anywhere near as important as you think it is. It's certainly not worth stressing out over.\n\nTake it from a student about to graduate who's failed multiple courses.",

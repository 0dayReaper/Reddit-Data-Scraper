    "postText": "I and numerous others I know are blocked behind comm 308, fina 385, and fina 395. Unless we do these classes, we cannot access 400 level or even some 300 level like comm 320 and comm 315. Im basically forced to do fina 385 and 395 at the same time, and I have to pass 308 the first time otherwise ill get significantly delayed. \n\nMy only option for the fall is to do 308 and literally THREE ELECTIVES, in order to have a complete 12 credits and not waste time. I could also add 305, but that would be impossible to do with 308 and would guarantee failure.\n\nIt sucks that the entire second half of my degree hinges on one class, its a complete joke.",

            "comment": "I wouldn't say poorly designed. COMM 308 sets the foundation for your entire degree and it makes sense that they require you to pass it to unlock the rest of the sequence. It is the same thing for most other programs. You need to pass general Chemistry I and II to unlock the rest of the CHEM track, you need Research methods and history of psychology to take most PSYCH core classes, ...etc. If anything JSMB students have it good because you can take COMM pretty early in your degree (only one pre-requisite) and its offered in the summer. Also, while you take COMM 308, you can take other COMM courses that have nothing to do with COMM 308. I don't know why you are forced to take three electives.",

The silver lining is that you're balancing a tough class with a bunch of electives, so you should do well ensuring you can take FINA 385 and 395 ASAP :)",

    "postText": "I received my midterm grade back today, and it was a lot lower than I thought: 42%\n\nI have received 98% on all WebWork submissions but with the final coming up I am a bit concerned if this will look bad on my transcript to fail a course.  My GPA is 3.15 and I need an average of 3 to get into the BCompSci degree program. From what I have been told they are looking for B+ average with all math courses.  I don't feel ready for the final coming up soon, do you think it would be better to drop the course and re-take it in summer session 2? Or even if I fail Math 204 for the first time and re-take it, it does not close doors to BCompSci entry?",

I have eaten shit on midterms plenty of times (my lowest grade was like 20% in dynamics) but thanks to hard work, assignments/projects, tutorials and YouTube videos ended up with mostly A- and A (dynamics I got an A+ somehow). \n\nKeep at it, go to the math help centre and DO THE WORK!!! you got this, trust the process and as usual all hail the curve gods",

I just hope I can pass and also get a minimum 3.0 GPA in the course. Not sure how flexible BCompSci entrance is on this if one math course is a pass but not quite a B-.\n\nWill cross that bridge down the road if it gets there. For now I will just have to try to get the highest grade possible.",

Unless they changed the way things work, there should be a high risk high reward grading scheme that heavily skews towards the final, so either you get a chance to save your grade and avoid paying and retaking the course, or you secure a spot for yourself (and you can drop the course before paying unless they take way too much time finalizing the grades for Summer 1, but that would be on them, not you).",

We were expecting to only do the midterm, and I think for many, including myself, we were writing in haste up until the very end, only having 70 minutes to complete it. Not as an excuse for poor grade but I think the class average would have improved with more time to do the midterm.\n\nI will try to study as much as possible these next few weeks and find shortcut methods to solving. 100/100 for the final is amazing. These summer session courses are very intense.",

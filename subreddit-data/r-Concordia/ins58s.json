Professors literally have zero need to make the class visible before classes actually start and they shouldn't because then people start worrying and stressing over the outline instead of enjoying whatever is left of their summer. Stop worrying and when times comes, you'll get your outline!",

The purpose of the comment was to let OP know that it is normal if he hasn't gotten it yet because people unecessarily stress over this. That's all.",

Are classes going to be live on Zoom, deffered, etc. It would have been nice to know a fews days prior to the beginning of the semester, because having live ou deffered classes changes a lot about logistics in your everyday life and your work schedule",

    "postText": "I was doing some research online on credit cards for international students and what the application process is like. Do you have any recommendations on ones that are easy to get approved for (as I currently have no credit history in Canada)? Were you able to apply online? I started an application online through BMO just to see what documentation they would ask for and I couldn\u2019t complete the form online because I don\u2019t have a Canadian ID. But I got an email that my application was received and a decision will be sent in the mail even through I didn\u2019t verify identity which I thought was weird.\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get denied for it because I\u2019m assuming I have to go into a branch to apply. I don\u2019t want to keep applying online and getting denied. Which banks/cards do you recommend?",

            "comment": "Two things that will raise red flags in any bank's security systems:\n\n* your inexistent credit history in Canada; and\n* your lack of a residence history in Canada.\n\nYour online application will likely be rejected for those two reasons.\n\nHowever, most banks will still do business with you provided that you comply with their identification requirements. That usually involves visiting  a branch and showing your ID to a representative. Each bank has its own rules when it comes to identification but be prepared to show a passport and proof of residence.  \n\nEven with your limited credit history, most banks will consider issuing you a credit card if you can make a security deposit equivalent to the credit limit you're seeking . Call the bank and ask.\n\nI don't recommend you go the debit-only route because Canada has its own debit network known as Interac and it has very limited capabilities. For example, you can't reserve a hotel room, rent a car, pay at automated payment stations, or pay for online purchases with Interac. Visa debit and MasterCard debit may be accepted by some online retailers but rarely at physical points of sale.\n\nI've had great service from RBC, BMO, CIBC and ScotiaBank. When I was a student, I had a no-annual fee cashback card with RBC. I would receive around $120 in cash each year despite my limited spending.\n\nOn a final note, American Express and Discover cards have limited acceptance in Canada. Your best bet is to stay with Visa or MasterCard.",

            "comment": "Hi, I work at CIBC as a financial rep so I see international students coming in everyday wanting a student credit card. \nI know at my bank, we offer an international student bundle, which is opening a chequing, savings, and credit card (cash back, 1k limit) all at once, and as an international student, you\u2019re always pre-approved, even without a credit history (we still need to ask you if we can pull a credit check though). \nYou do, however need to show 2 pieces of valid ID, normally your foreign passport and study permit should be sufficient. I have yet to see anyone declined on my end.",

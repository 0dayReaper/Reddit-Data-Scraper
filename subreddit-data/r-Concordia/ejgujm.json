    "postText": "At the end of every term, there are lots of questions on here about final grades and a lot of misconceptions about how they work. I teach in CS and other courses at Gina Cody. This is the inside scoop on how your marks work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Marking final exams**\n\n* Assuming you have a final exam, it usually takes a long time to mark. It is easy to under-appreciate how much work marking takes. A class of 80 students writing for 3 hours is 240 hours of exam writing work. Marking is obviously faster than writing an exam. If it is 10x faster, that is still 24 hours that needs to be load balanced with the rest of your work and life. \n* Starting with a stack of 80 exams and flipping each one to the sixth page can take 10 minutes alone. :)\n* Multiple choice is quick to mark (machine marked) but students tend to do better on it because selecting a right answer is easier than recalling a right answer (recognition is easier than recall).\n* It is easy to think of a prof as a teacher because that is an undergraduate student\u2019s main interaction with them. In reality, most profs only spend less than a quarter of their time on courses, as opposed to research and other services. \n* A good prof will complete their marking for each course within 2 weeks from the exam date. A sufficient prof will complete it before the next term starts. A slow prof can (I believe) submit up to the drop deadline of the next term.\n* All my graduate course also have projects. These are brutal. 10 page reports from 80 students is 800 pages which is like reading a textbook in a week or two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The bell curve**\n\n* There seems to be a lot of confusion about the bell curve. Maybe in some departments, profs use a formal method. In other universities, when grades are percentages instead of letters, they might also use a formal method. However every single profs I\u2019ve discussed this with computes marks the same way (as below)\n* I take the marks in a spreadsheet and compute the grade as percentage according to the course outline. This provides a ranking of students. Rank is the most important and no pair of students will ever receive different grades that are out of order from their rank.\n* At Gina Cody, as our course outlines generally say: \u201cThere is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades assigned.\u201d\n* Nothing is set in stone, but you won\u2019t raise eyebrows if you hand out less than 10% A+, around 25% of grades in the A range, maybe 40% in B range, etc. \n* A robot could take the ranking, give the first 5% of students an A+, 10% an A, 10% an A-, etc, etc. In reality, we use more discretion. We look for gaps in the marks so that clusters of marks make sense and no student is say, half a percentage from a bump in letter grade. If we teach the course a lot, we might have some indications that a cohort one year is stronger than another year, and the distribution might vary.\n* Does this mean you could get, say, an 84% and be given a C+? Technically, yes, if most of the class got more than 84%! But obviously no prof wants this. So profs tend to give hard exams, especially final exams, to strongly differentiate students and to suppress the class average. \n* If you have to give a C to a student who scores 73% in a class with a high average, you will have a lot of conflict and pushback. But if you give an A- to a student who gets 73% in a class with a low average, they will be grateful (as well as the students who gets a C for 35%). This is why lots of courses have \u201ckiller\u201d final exams. \n* Instead of bell curving, we usually say we \u201cstretch the intervals\u201d so that an A+ stretches from a \u201cstandard\u201d 90-100% to say an 85-100%, etc. \n* The easiest way to make a final exam \u201chard\u201d and have a low average is to make it long. I don\u2019t like this approach because I think it unfairly supports students who can write exams fast as opposed to know the material. But none-the-less, use this to your advantage! If you have a long exam, sprint through it as quickly as possible and get something down for every question. Then improve your answers in a queue from what you know best to what you know least. If you run out of time, it is good news because even if you had more time, you wouldn\u2019t be getting a lot of marks for the extra work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Grade submission**\n\n* Large courses with multiple sections and a course coordinator will generally do some comparison and equalization of marks across sections. They can take the longest to receive your mark because they are delayed until the slowest professor of the group finishing marking.\n* The professor uploads the marks electronically to Concordia but they do not appear until they are approved.\n* There is usually three levels of approval (e.g., coordinator, department, faculty). It is not clear to me to what extent the higher ups actually scrutinize the marks, I suspect they do not intervene unless if the grade distribution does not look normal (I mean normal literally and figuratively). I have never had my marks sent back.\n* The approvals are digital. They can take less than an hour if everyone is online or up to a week, especially for Fall courses when the marks are submitted over the holidays.\n* If students are pending graduation and there is an upcoming commencement ceremony (end of summer term or end of winter term), marking for them is accelerated to make sure they can graduate on time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reviewing your grade**\n\n* You can and should review your final exam, if only to check that it is added up correctly. We make simple, unintentional mistakes sometimes. Sometimes grades from labs / assignments marked by a TA are missing.\n* Simply email your professor and ask for an appointment.\n* If you\u2019ve never checked, don\u2019t feel bad. Almost always, the adjustments are marginal and don\u2019t change the letter grade. But it is worth doing in my opinion. \n* Profs can initiate a grade change digitally. The grade change is then subject to the same approvals as your final grades.\n* I don\u2019t think there is any time limit to changing your grade. I\u2019ve changed them over a year after in one unusual circumstance. However profs are only required to keep a copy of your final exam for a year after the course completes.",

However, given the many years that the University has been running, Concordia administration is very much aware of how many markers it would take to post grades at a reasonable time. Clearly, when it comes to hiring and paying people to do necessary work (grading exams, cleaning bathrooms, providing a sufficient amount of advisors, etc) this university is not up to par. An unimaginable amount of money comes into the university through donations, tuition (local and international) and government grants and it is clear that not nearly enough is going back to its students. \nThe dissatisfaction of the students who pay a substantial amount of money for these services is valid.",

What happens if some students who have an A+ average before the final (in the top 5% of the class) but get a below 50% mark in the final.  Will they be failing the course?  Is some form of curve fitting needed in that case.  This is not a hypothetical case, it's happening with Math ENGR 315 and hundreds of students awaiting their marks (still on January 3rd) are anxious and wonder what to do about their course registration for this Winter Semester.  Do you appreciate the quandary they are in?  Thank you,",

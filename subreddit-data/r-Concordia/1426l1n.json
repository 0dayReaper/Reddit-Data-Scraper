    "postText": "I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m indecisive and scared to make the wrong choice and could use any opinion or comment at this point. I am interested in social media/marketing/content creation. It\u2019s been a year that I\u2019m in university doing my prerequisites so that i can get into marketing. I currently have a 3.77 gpa but still have math 208 and 209. Right now I am completing math 206 and I\u2019m struggling. I completed a communication program in C\u00e9gep which i enjoyed and thought that the next thing for me is a marketing degree but now I am not so sure. If i am already struggling with math 206, it\u2019s only going to go downhill in math 208 and 209 right? I don\u2019t know if i should risk my gpa and keep trying with the math courses or keep my gpa intact and apply for communication (minimum requirement is a B-) it feels like it\u2019s the right move trying out for communication and not complete the prerequisites but that means i have to stop studying for a whole year. Idk feels like I\u2019m wasting my time. I could get a certificate in social media marketing while i wait i guess. I don\u2019t know I just feel all over the place, and just unmotivated when it comes to the math classes. Or i could just suck it up and push through",

            "comment": "As someone working in the domain, I can tell you that I'm barely using what I learned in class. So in theory, having a degree in communication would be alright. However, employers do seem to especially love marketing degrees. I'm not sure if you've done the other business classes for marketing. There are a few finance and accounting classes that are very difficult. So you should take a look at them first. If you've already done them and are just worried about the math classes, I would suggest you try to take them in a cegep if possible. They cost way less so you can redo them multiple times if needed, and they're relatively easier. \n\nIn the meantime, you can still try taking classes at the university, in either program, to see what you like and keep gaining credits. Even if you decide to go in one program, your credits can still count at electives. \n\nAlso if you go in marketing, it's much easier to switch to another business domain if that's something that interests you. Lastly, I have not finished my degree and have already gotten over 2 years of experience, which allowed me to get hired by a bigger company recently. But in general, I do recommend that you speak to employees or recruiters in the domain, and look at job postings to see what they ask. If you don't think you'll enjoy your time in marketing, it may not be worth the mental health issues down the line.",

I had two social media focused jobs, and my new one is a bit of social media but mainly updating magazines, flyers, websites and signs for new properties. I found social media to be very tiring for me because I can only do so much designing and writing engaging promotional stuff.",

In the end math is just about getting the method hardwired into your brain, so it\u2019s just about focusing and practicing. \nGood luck!",

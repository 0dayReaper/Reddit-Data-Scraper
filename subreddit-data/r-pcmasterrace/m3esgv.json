The company laptop actually has an SSD. In fact it\u2019s relatively new. They get us refreshes every 3 years. It\u2019s just that it gets weighed down with more software to prevent corporate espionage than the anchor on a battleship. Literally everything you do on it is monitored. I have to go through a support form every year just to keep the USB ports active otherwise they remotely disable them. And with my job I literally NEED the ports active because that\u2019s how I renew my service keys. \n\nMy home computer specs:\ni7 8700k\n32GB DDR4 3600 \nGTX1080 (waiting for stock on the new ones)\n.5TB Samsung 970 evo nvme \n\nAnd 30 seconds for my home computer is if I fat finger my login and scratch my ass for 15 seconds.

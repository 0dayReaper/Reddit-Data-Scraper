Most of this sort of stuff is civil not criminal so you don\u2019t even need a lawyer. It\u2019s about being able to afford to take off of work for a court case (potentially more than one day), being able to spare the time to prepare for the case, and other financial burdens that are secondary to actually paying for representation. \n\nThere\u2019s also forced arbitration. Which is now legal and most companies use to prevent lawsuits. Even though these forced arbitration\u2019s may not be legally valid in all or even most cases, you again need to be able to take the time and the financial hit to be able to argue against it. \n\nClass action lawsuits are a very small part of these situations. Your family members situation is in no way relevant to what we were discussing here in regards to consumer protection laws. While still important, it\u2019s a different topic than the one we have at hand here.",

In Pharrell's video, a bunch of randos dance around all kinda generically while he's basically just like \"be happy, happy good, happy a me a being a lot right now\" basically saying nothing.\n\nThen Weird Al's version is actually *about* something, embracing the tackiness that is inside of you, that real deep tackiness. And instead of faceless nobodies jumping around generically, its his friends, real expressive comedians like Kristin Schaal and Jack Black, getting to go wild and really show their personalities in their movements and style.\n\n\nSeriously, cant recommend this video highly enough.",

This meant that I had access to not only our store's inventory listing but the listing of every store. I also had access to the weekly list of items that were being repriced for clearance.\n\nSo, I needed a new PC and had a few hundred bucks and spent a few weeks watching and waiting. Finally a bunch of towers were dropping off the inventory to make room for new product, I think my eye landed on something like an 800MHz Celeron for stupid cheap. Of course we didn't have any left, and there were only two in inventory in the entire country. One was actually in our district, so I rang up the store and said we had a customer who wanted it and requested a transfer.\n\nGot there 3 days later, and I unloaded it personally. It was reboxed and when I picked it up something heavy was clunking around in there. Opened up the case and sure enough *the heat sink and fan* were only attached by the fan power cable and just pinballing around inside there for who knows how long.\n\nGrabbed some paste, reattached them, tested it out, and worked fine. I used that PC for something like 7 years in one form or another.",

I ordered it around the end of Februrary and got it mid March, but they said the estimated ship date would've been sometime in May, so they build and ship based on supply. You might be like me and get yours in less than a month, or have to wait several. Their customer service is also pretty abysmal because they're severely understaffed, so any issue you have will probably take at least a few weeks to resolve. I've also read reports from last year about some people getting their computers and receiving fucked up GPUs, and then having to work through previously aforementioned terrible customer service to get replacements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe overall conclusion I came to was that if you live really far away from California (where they're based) the chances of rough handling damaging the build (despite decent packaging) increases slightly, but I have no idea by how much statistically. I live maybe 400 miles away from them in the same state, and I had no damage issues. I also don't know if those reports are still happening, or if they were just clustered around Black Friday/Christmas of last year and then dropped off, so you should look into it yourself. The packaging for my computer looked really stable and everything worked fine save for the included copy of Windows not registering properly, which they later fixed by giving me a proper authorization serial after two weeks of email bombing them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know I just said some pretty alarming shit about them, but I felt I should be 100% honest about both my own experience with them and the experiences I've read. To be honest, I'm sure a lot of people have gotten their stuff from them with minimal problems like me (the serial thing was a minor hiccup that didn't prevent me from using the computer really), and we're not going to go out on the internet in droves and talk about it all that often because we're busy enjoying our new computers and RTX 30 series cards. I feel for people who already have builds and are trying to just get a GPU; it seems like a really frustrating thing to have to go through right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps! Cheers.",

Last I checked (aka prior to prices going insane) they would match MSRP which let me grab a build with an 2080 when at the time getting a 2080 for msrp was basically impossible.  \nThe rest of their parts are decently solid quality and you will know the manufacturer and model of the parts.  There is no nameless raw metal PSU that is going to explode in a year, there is no motherboard put together with hot glue, or things of that nature.  \n\nThat said you are paying MSRP for quality parts, this is not going to be a budget option...  Though its also probably among your best options for getting a decent full featured computer outside of living on the internet trying to get various parts as they become available and racing scalper and bots.",

I never built a PC before so it was a bit daunting for me to do this in a \"rush\".  \n\nStill I checked prices for parts but it quickly dawned on me that prebuilts are better deals at this point.  So I jumped on a prebuilt very similar to yours for $1900 CDN taxes included (also on Amazon).",

When they brought it up to Dell the response was \"well you weren't supposed to see that charge, where was it on your invoice we need to make sure we roll that into another charge so you don't get confused in the future.\"\n\nAnother giant issue is that they needless make their hardware conform to non-standards so their is essentially no reliable repair paths.  The issue here is if a common failure occurs on the motherboard, power supply, etc you will not be able to find a replacement part.  This is a huge contribution to e-waste among other issues.\n\nThen their is bloatware and custom drivers/firmware which actually degrade the performance of the hardware you purchased.\n\nI could go on, but seriously F Dell.",

'would new hardware  fundamentally change the way you game for the better?' \n\nIt's refreshing to see someone treat viewers as actual people, informing them of the stuff no one else tells you; it's more environmentally friendly to not upgrade every couple years. He'll tell you that maybe a pre-built is right for you if you fit into certain situations.\n\nI think I just like that he doesn't treat people as 'consumers' a word I've really gotten to hate.

My $35 watch I had for 15 years was starting to lose time so I went on r/watches to find a replacement. My god! Every watch they talked about is at least $500 and when looking up the $200 watch that was right at the top of my price range, I\u2019d find comments like \u201cnot bad for a beater\u201d or \u201cwell, for $200 you can\u2019t expect perfection...\u201d\n\nWorst was I found myself falling into that same thinking after a couple days of browsing watches and reading articles. I even added a couple of $500 watches to my wishlist. My old watch is in the shop and I\u2019m waiting for the results, but if I have to get a new one, I\u2019m giving myself a couple weeks to \u201ccool off\u201d before buying one of the \u201ccheaper\u201d $200 watches I looked at.",

They seem to think that you should only buy high end gear if you truly care enough (whether it be vinyl, headphones, pc gaming, watches, etc). However some people who are more casual or just wanting to dip their toes in, might ask for some kinda budget thing they can do, then they just try to tell them \"this hobby isn't for you then\". \n\nThere's nothing wrong with budgeted items as long as you let the person know what they're getting into, some can't afford decent gear. And if budget gear can get you 70% of the way there for half the price, why not? Pushing the people who genuinely want to be involved in the hobby away, only makes it so people who have more money than passion or are overly obssesive are the ones left.",

I figured why not here?\n\nI started Steam just a few minutes ago. It booted up just fine I thought, but all the store pages and library pages I tried to load were blank. Gave it a couple of minutes, thinking my connection was slow or their servers were slow, but after about 5 minutes, nothing was appearing on screen. I thought logging in and out would fix this issue, and now I'm stuck on this screen. \n\nTried restarting, tried reinstalling my Steam client through the installer. Nothing. My next thought is doing a completely fresh install by deleting the entire directory. \n\nI'm not seeing anything about any sort of wide-spread outage. Not that I think that's the culprit, this feels like a corrupted install of my client to me. I know they're rolling out those big UI changes soon. I haven't opted-in to any Betas for those, but have they since rolled out to everyone? Is anyone seeing anything like this? Would really prefer to not have to nuke my entire Steam directory if I can avoid it.\n\n[This should be the window to login to my Steam client.](https://preview.redd.it/to4wobrrkz5b1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cf6508ab3512648c2c5de750a629bc07bcc163d3)",

I figured I might as well try that since that usually fixes everything. I tried running a virus scan, wondering if I caught some bug or something, and I didn't find anything.\n\nI'm officially at a total loss now.",

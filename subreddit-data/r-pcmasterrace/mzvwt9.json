Get some dumb atheist to sell you theirs for $1, then turn around and sell it to the devil for the best gaming card on the market or whatever your heart desires. A soul isn't worth extremely warping reality for someone for, but for almost any modest asking price, the dark forces will oblige. There's just one caveat that you have to believe in them, or else they won't/can't(?) do anything for you.",

But from the most scientific standpoint, I just bought a bunch of souls off people. Sure, some percentage of them were bogus deals where they were pretending to sell something they'd already sold, but out of my large batches, there's a very high chance that I was the first buyer and thus the legal owner as far as trading goes. Plus whenever I would perform such dark arts that require such a large payment of an entire soul, I worked conditional statements into the contacts like \"if I have an available soul which I have the rights to trade available that is not my own, then so I offer this for &lt;insert desire&gt;. I only did it 3 times in my life since I worry about the ramifications of the souls I've traded for frivolous things like winning raffles and ways to aquire money, but the things that I asked for came to be in ways that would have required astronomical luck otherwise. I figure a soul isn't worth all that much, like it's not going to give you superpowers, but ask for small things that the small chaotic forces in the universe could easily line up over time and you may have a deal.",

It ain't the greatest option for all out mining but a nice chunk of change on the side with a lower risk to your GPU then straight up farming with it at max load 24/7/365.  Some other comments dive into the details a bit more but that's my 2 cents.",

My 3070 will run about $12.50 a month for electricity compared to about $180 in income.\n\nAs far as hardware lifetime is concerned - really only the fans will be taxed and they are easy to replace. Fans have lifetimes of about 70,000 hours on average, so most of the time even those will last until obsolescence. Electronic components can last WAY longer. When you look up failure rates from there you are given them as a FIT rate (Failures in Time). FIT rates are number of failures per BILLION hours, and it's not uncommon to see FIT rates that are less than 1 (less then 1 failure per billion hours).",

And on low profitability days I make between 8 to 10% less.\n\nOn the average day I make 3 to 4% less which works out to be $1.50 to 2 bucks less. I'm willing to lose that for the convenience of not having to convert my ethereum to Bitcoin because I'm long term on Bitcoin and not on ethereum.\n\nMy favorite part there are times like this where it's volatile and as the price of Bitcoin plummets I get paid more Bitcoin... Partially because of the cash conversion and how people tend to look at it, a mental thing... And partially because the interest in nice hash skyrockets when people see the price fall.\n\nIf the price stabilizes and becomes boring, so people are not all excited about the crypto and everything else then I have to switch over because the difference between nice hash and directly mining will be larger and more consistent.\n\nRight now I'm kind of skipping across the peaks and ending up a little bit ahead of directly mining.",

Nicehash is a business that is providing the software, the exchange and offloading a lot of the time and knowledge for running mining rig to them. Mining for crypto yourself in an optimal manner will net you higher gains than selling your hash power to others though Nicehash's market.\n\nNicehash is a business, just like any other, They are going to get a cut of the profit for the services they provide. Just because the overhead for those services are not worth the cost to you don't mean it is a scam.",

They're taking real resources (electricity, and whatever you burn to make it) and turning it into something that only has value if people believe it has value.  You can't live in a house built of crypto or eat crypto for nourishment.\n\nOn top of that, a lot of the world's electricity comes from burning coal, especially in places like China.  If climate change becomes a death spiral and society breaks down, cryptocurrencies will be worth nothing to the survivors.",

I don't know. Sorry, everyone. I'm only trying to make the point to the parent comment here that the value conception also applies to paper currency not just bitcoin.

There is also shipping delays due to covid. Higher demand for pc parts because of the stay at home surge in purchasing over the last year. This is affecting more than just computer parts. The car industr and electronics manufacturing are another two areas suffering. Treated timber is also hard to come by at the moment so the construction industry is suffering. The electrical trade is finding it hard to get parts made in the UK or India. I work in this area and it is almost impossible to get certain size circuit breakers at the moment.",

The miner then hashes that block until it gets a result starting with a specific number of 0s. Once they've found a working hash, they propagate that block to other miners who can verify it. From that point forward the transactions are permanent, since the hash of that block will be included in the next block, creating a \"chain\" where undoing a transaction would require redoing the work for the entire chain after it.\n\nIt just so happens that for some chains like Ethereum, a GPU is the best thing for hashing. On chains like Monero it's a CPU, and for Bitcoin there are special machines called ASIC miners that are built just to be efficient at BTC's hashing algorithm.",

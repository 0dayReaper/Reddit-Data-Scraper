You could also just grab a decent pair of headphones but particularly on hot summer days I definitely appreciate having speakers.\n\nAt least they're the most used peripherals of my system.",

A cheap method I was thinking was using some right-angle clamps or something to hold two pieces of wood vertically behind the two outer monitors. Then add a little shelf type thing at the top and then set the speakers on top of those. \n\nJust an idea. I'm baked.",

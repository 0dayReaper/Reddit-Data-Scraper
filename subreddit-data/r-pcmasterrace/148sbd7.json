    "postText": "Just got my first computer (prebuilt) and was having trouble getting a display on my monitor. Did some troubleshooting, tried different cables, made sure it wasn\u2019t the monitor itself and still nothing. After some googling the next step I found was to uninstall and reinstall my RAM sticks. I carefully unlocked both sides and pulled each stick straight out and then I noticed that the rightmost slot is all fucked up. Got 0 experience with this kind of thing but it seems like it might be problematic. Help is much appreciated",

If they don't approve it, then you might want to try to take a plastic [tool](https://3.imimg.com/data3/YI/KB/MY-5043498/plastic-tool-500x500.jpg) and try to gently prod at it, if it's extra residue from MB manufacture, you could try to carefully remove it, if the slot is melted, bad luck I'm afraid, you could try to run only on 3 slots, but I wouldn't recommend it in this case.",

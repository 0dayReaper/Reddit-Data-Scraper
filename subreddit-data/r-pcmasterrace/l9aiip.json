These CPUs offer 20 PCIe lanes. 16 of which is generally reserved for use with a GPU. Leaving only 4 additional lanes for the remaining PCIe devices. Those 4 M.2 SSD have to use the remaining 4 lanes and each will be reduced in speed to just a single PCIe lane. That means they get reduced to PCIe x1 speed which is about 900-1000 MB/s. Now that\u2019s \u201cslow\u201d but still not as slow as SATA drive which was the older way storage devices connected to the motherboard. \n\nCPUs that offer more PCIe lane generally are server level or industrial level chips. You may have heard of AMD Threadripper and EPYC. These CPUs offer a lot of PCIe lanes which would actually allow more PCIe devices to not bottleneck. Thus you can have those 4 SSDs running in full bandwidth without a bottleneck.",

Everything connected to the chipset shares a single set of lanes back to the cpu. Normally, this is fine since most of what would be connected to the chipset does not constantly use all the lanes available. But you could still experience a bottleneck if miltiple slots are under load simultaneously. For example, if you ran those drives in a raid.",

I normally build and let YouTube videos run in the background so anyway here I am my case balanced in my left arm, screw driver in my right hand trying to get a mobo screw in. All of a sudden I hear \"you need a table\". I lol'ed it off as just another stupid thing in the Verge video. Then it hit me Steve uses a table, Kyle uses a table, Jay used a table, even Linus uses a table. I thought I should use a table too, OMG what a game changer. Once I attached the screw driver to the table facing up, I balanced the screw on the screw driver then I used 2 hands and rotate the case around to screw in the screw. \n\n(This is my resume for a job at the Verge)",

You do need to top up the reservoir however for a while after installing to remove air bubbles otherwise you run the risk of high temps and turbulence (air in the loop).\n\nQuick tip for anyone with turbulence in their loop, turn your pc off and tilt your case 90 degrees (with all cables disconnected).  Listen out for air bubbles escaping (sounds like bubbles in water popping).  Tilt it another 90 degrees and repeat until the case has been rotated fully.  Each time you hear air bubbles escaping wait until it stops, then top up the reservoir.\n\nThis will elimate air in the loop and will drastically reduce temps.  Don't forget to KEEP the reservoir stop plug on so that the liquid doesn't spill out inside the case also!",

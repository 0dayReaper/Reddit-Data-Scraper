    "postText": "One day I was using my laptop and it got turned off suddenly. It was on battery. I turned it on again and I connected the charger thinking it might be due to battery issue. But it happened again and now I cannot use the laptop. So i tried diagnosing it and the HWinfo software is showing PCIe bus error under the Hardware error. \nIs it something related to the chip level or could it be some driver or individual component related ??\n\n\nPlease help.",

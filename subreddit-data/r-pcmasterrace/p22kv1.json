But his wife, she was a different story. He told me initially that she had Alzheimer's, but later redacted that.\n\nIn the time I lived there she 1) accused me of sneaking a large dog into the basement and training it to bark and wake her up 2) moved their home stereo into the bathroom that shared a wall with my unit and blasted christian rock music at 3 am because she \"heard me making a bunch of racket and it sounded like devil worship\" ( I was asleep) 3) knocked a bird's nest out of a tree in my front yard and smashed the eggs on my porch because she saw me taking pictures of it and finally 4) let herself in to my living room through the locked door when I had my girlfriend of 5 months over and accused me of \"always having different women over\" (literally had never had any other women over, but this was fun explaining to my then girlfriend). I had to call her husband over get her to leave.  I learned later that she would regularly let herself in and snoop around, and felt entitled to do so when confronted because it's \"her property\".\n\nOn the last month of my lease I got a letter from their lawyer, completely out of the blue, informing me I was to vacate the property in 30 days or be evicted. No reason given, just that they were within their rights to do it. I was a model tenant so really got upset at this more than the rest of it. When I confronted them about it the guy just apologized while his wife screamed at me to get the hell out of their house and good riddance.\n\nJust hijacked to share and say I hope you see justice for this, such a shitty feeling dealing with asshole landlords and they rarely pay for their actions.",

So the next day she walked down, heard the usual arguing/screaming and just knocked on the door and the voices immediately stopped. To her surprise an older looking lady in her 50\u2019s opened the door and there was nothing going on. No evil cult worshippers, no abusive husbands, no one but her, and a very confused cat sitting on a couch.  She couldn\u2019t believe it. The lady said she had no idea what she heard and it was just her inside. She eventually had to get police involved, it turned out this psycho lady was huffing some sort of toxic inhalant and just going crazy, speaking in like 10 different voices while arguing with herself. My point is, some people are fuckin crazy.",

IIRC, the primary *possessory* interest (as opposed to primary *title* interest) controls, meaning that, yes, the landlord could commit burglary because the tenant is entitled to primary possession. Take that with a grain of salt because we also learned that primary possessory interest applies in cases of common law larceny, too (meaning you could be convicted of larceny for taking your own property from someone who had the primary possessory interest), but my bar program expressly said you can\u2019t steal your own property and drew no distinction as to possessory interest (it only focused on title interest). Also not a lawyer yet so none of this is legal advice.",

It's been surveyed but he still thinks it was stolen. \n\nOne day, her son heard a weird sound on his truck. Asked another relative (who knows nothing about cars) to listen as he drives by. Relative hears nothing so they go about their business. Next day, no noise but the wheel just falls off while he's driving (safest possible conditions really). Guess that's what the sound was. \n\nCouple days later, wheel falls off a utv that's kept in a barn away from where anyone lives. A couple other vehicles in that barn had loose lugs and no reason for them to be loose. \n\nSomeone was fucking with our shit and that guy has motive. There are cameras up now.",

As long as the components weren't powered on when water was introduced to the system, and the system hasn't been powered on since, you can disassemble and submerge every component in 100% isopropyl alcohol. 100% isopropyl alcohol evaporates without any residue, and will dissolve any trace elements left from the water off of your equipment. \n\nOnce submerged for ~24 hours and then completely air dried for at least as long you should be able to plug and play. \n\nThere may be other damage to components that the isopropyl alcohol bath won't fix, though.\n\nEdit: I'm just a hobbyist, and this is the easiest way I've found to address liquid damage to a computer and I have done this several times to motherboards and GPUs for myself and friends. Accidents happen. But there are some actual liquid repair specialists responding to my post with better methods! Look for those posts below mine for more information on what to do.",

            "comment": "TLDR; landlord has psychosis and is paranoid, thinks i work for the government and am spying because I have a CS degree. Destroys my shit after locking us out for two days and gets arrested and hit with two felonies.\n\nSo, my friend and I were looking to move into an apartment in a nice part of our city where a lot of young people rent. After looking for a few days on zillow my friend called me and said he found a great place and the guy wants to give us a tour. The place is an old three story house, where the first two floors are the home and the third floor is an apartment with access from a side door. The owner is just some dude who lives in the bottom two floors. When he was showing us around it was clear he was a little weird but my roommate and I thought he was a cokehead or something, which wouldn't be a problem since we planned on paying rent on time. In particular, he had a baseball hat on with a brim that was curved even further inwards, seemingly from him compulsively bending the brim. He was also a close talker, as in he would move closer and closer until he was bumping shoulders with you and if you moved back he would follow. Serious redflags for sure but we wanted a place in the area and it was a spacious apartment, and neither of us really had any clue what to make of the odd behaviors. A couple of days later we signed a lease and handed over our security deposit and first months rent, and he handed over the keys (again, this is in late June with a target move in date of August 1st).\nMy friends lease ends in July so he asked if he could move in a bit early and the landlord guy said yeah a week early is fine.\n\nBetween signing the lease and everything else, we found that he has criminal charges and a mugshot on google if you look his name up for harassing his ex wife. Definitely not a good sign but we had already signed a lease and were concerned about being able to break it cleanly. \n\nSo sometime in July my friend contacts the landlord and he says the week early move in is still good. About a week later we had some questions about something and I honestly forget what, but all of our calls go straight to voicemail and texts are undelivered. Definitely not a good sign. We end up checking out the apartment and notice that a lot of the simple things that needed to be done (cleaning, basic plumping maintentence) have not been done. Upon some futher inspection we also noticed that there are cut cables all over the place (coax and a doorbell wire), meaning we would have to get service done to have any internet connection.\n\nMy friend was pretty pissed about all of this and the fact that he fell off of the face of the earth so he went around and asked the neighbors what they know. First neighbor gives him the number of our landlords mother. After calling her, we find out that he has been in the mental hospital and she doesnt  know when he is getting out. She also says she had no idea he leased the upstairs apartment out but she will do everything she can to make the process smooth. She made arangements to get some maintentence done on the place and cleaned it herself. While speaking to her some more information about her son leaks. It turns out that he's at the hospital before for some sort of psychosis / paranoia is likely bipolar - great!\n\nSo the calm before the storm was the first week after we moved in. For about a week we were seriously enjoying living in the area and the apartment was pretty nice. We both grew up in suburbia so being able to walk 3 minutes to get a coffee, get food, or get a drink was amazing. It is also quite a beautiful neighborhood with very caring homeowners, and high property values. That all came to a pretty abrupt end when the landlord was released from the hospital. First thing he did was enter our apartment without permission and force his way into the rooms to look at the cable setup. To be clear, he just walked and I told him he shouldnt go in my roommates room because he wasnt home but he didn't listen but I am too timid for my own good so I didnt stand my ground while my more confident roommate wasnt home. He saw a coax splitter and asked if it was an antenna, I obviously said no but it was immedietly concerning to me. He left after that and shortly after he entered without permission again and handed me an addendum to the lease he wanted us to sign. It basically said that we don't work for or with any government agency and aren't collecting any data on him. At this point I'm getting pretty stressed so I tell him I have to talk to my roommate about it and he leaves. I had to go to work at this point so I left the apartment and my rooommate got back shortly after. My roommate does a lot of his work from home so after working for a bit he noticed the internet cut out. After about 30 minutes of trouble shooting he bangs on the landlords door. He says he didn't cut anything but when pressed says he unscrewed the coax service from outside, and he plugs it back in. Roommate works for an hour and the internet is cut out again. He calls the guys mom and she comes over right away and talks him down.\n\nAt this point we were considering our options on how to leave, but obviously we didn't move fast enough...\n\nOver the next couple of days things are going smoothly. We see him around the property a few times and have some pretty normal conversations (one about the lawn, one about a former tenant). This didn't last long thought and after about a week of him being back, my internet cuts out at around 11 PM. My roommate, a friend, and I all go to the coax service outside and of course it is unplugged. We plug it back in and go back inside. The next morning there is no internet and the cable is cut. I also notice the power blinks several times for &gt; 30 minutes each time. He was messing with the power in addition to having sliced the coax. We call the cops and they basically say unless he keeps the power off for 24h they cant do anything, and he doesn't respond to the cops banging on his door (even though we saw him earlier and he didn't leave). Roommate and I grab some essentials and go stay at our parents places since we are not feeling safe there. I grab my work laptop, laundry, and a few other things but my roommate felt compelled to grab all of his electronics. He recommended I did the same and I can confidently say I am a moron for not doing so. We both went home. \n\nThe next day my roommate went during his lunch break to grab a few things. Screen door on the outside of the house that was our only way in was locked with a key we didn't have. Landlord comes outside and says we're evicted (evictions during COVID lol), roommate says thats obviously not true but the landlord didn;t want to converse. Roommate calls be and I come over, we call the cops. His mom comes over but cant get in because he nailed the door she has a key to shut. Cops are called they make a report. Several instances of an illegal eviction, which is a misdemeanor in my state (NY). We can't get in so we get some food around teh corner and leave.\n\nThat brings us today which was almost certainly one of the worst days of my life. Wake up at 7:30 to go to the public safety building. Talk to a paralegal at 9:00 and sign warrents for arrest with roommate (we each signed one). We also talk to his parole officer (police the prior day gave us the contact info), who says he cant do much. We then decided to go back to the apartment and get in by any means necessary since most people (including the landlords mother) seem to think we are legally allowed to break in. At the apartment the outside screen door was actually unlucked but the door right after it was locked and had some wet paper shoved into the lock which had dried, but we were able to get it out with a paperclip and some water. There is one more door we have to unlock at this point (which also has paper in the lock) to get into the apartment but we dont feel safe going in on our own so we request police presence. After about 2 hours the landlord just strolls up from out of nowhere and yells \"please direct all questions to my lawyer.\" Another bad sign.",

                    "comment": "Cops arrive shortly after, say a half hour. In the meantime we hear all sorts of banging going around in the house. Cops mess with the final door to the apartment and manage to force the lock. The two cops go up the stairs and my roommate tails them. The cops start yelling and my roommate runs out. Turns out the landlord was in our apartment instead of his home. The cop yelled something like \"oh shit not you again\" implying some sort of past history. Turns out this officer was the guy that had to chase him around a public park and arrest him after he jumped out of his sisters car, he was then brought to the hospital for psychiatric problems. The cops end up cuffing him (no resistance by the landlord) and walk him down stairs after a while. I held my tongue but basically just said \"have fun bud\" when he walked by. We went up stairs and I looked in my room, saw that my pc was not on my desk, along with a ton of cables and a monitor missing. My girlfriend was also there and she said that I need to see the tub. This is a picture of that tub. I left it like that for hours because I was scared of getting electrocuted. There was about an hour of time where I was just upset sort of sitting around but then I started packing everything and me and my roommate moved everything out. Fortunately our families were able to help us move our stuff, but it was quite exhausting (the stairs to the third floor are hellish with heavy or bulky stuff).\n\nAfter he was taken away by the police some of the neighbors told us that he had assulted the mom at one point, meaning his mom knew he had a history of violence and was unstable but didnt recommend we leave.\n\nToday was mostly spent talking to police and moving all of my belongings out of my apartment. At some point in time the mom refunded our deposit and first months rent out of her own pocket. \n\nI can try to answer some questions. I do know this all sounds insane and unbelievable, which is something I'm sort of dealing with now - it really doesn't feel real yet but it will probably hit me sometime soon. I was crying a bit here and there today just because it was super stressfull, I'm not a big gamer and didn't lose any important data but I couldn't really handle it. This was literally today (I think he got cuffed around 3 EST). Cops said he is probably gonna be out tomorrow which is why we got all of our shit out. \n\nHis suspicion of me began with the fact that i have a CS degree and am going to graduate school nearby for CS. Obviously anyone who knows how to programmer knows how to spy on people, right? His paranoia kicked in because his meds did not and caused this who shit show.\n\nAgain, sorry for the scatterbrained write up here but it literally happened &lt; 12 hours ago and I had to move out afterwards. \n\nAnd I am well aware of the fact that I am a bit of a moron for not getting out of this situation sooner, like a lot sooner.\n\nTLDR; landlord has psychosis and is paranoid, thinks i work for the government and am spying because I have a CS degree. Destroys my shit after locking us out for two days and gets arrested and hit with two felonies.",

They were fine. \n\nYour big issues are getting all the water out and any impurities off the circuit boards and preventing corrosion before it happens. \n\nTime is of the essence.  The pc needs to be immediately and completely disassembled.  Even the graphics card needs to be disassembled as much as you can. Then you want to fill a huge tub with isopropyl alcohol.  Immerse each piece and give it a light brushing with a toothbrush.  Remove from the bath and let dry.  \n\nSome things like a traditional hard drive won\u2019t be salvageable but an SSD should be if you can get all the water out.  I\u2019d be a little worried about the PSU just because of how it\u2019s constructed and the difficulty of getting it cleaned out.  Memory and motherboard are almost certainly fine.\n\n[edit]\n\nI should have mentioned, don\u2019t just assemble and cross your fingers that it will work.  Go slow.  Test one part at a time.  Start with cheaper parts first.  \n\nTry the PSU on its own.  Does that work?  That\u2019s the biggest risk.  If it\u2019s fried (and probably is), then it could send power spikes through the system and fry everything else.  \n\nIf you can test individual parts on a bench, that\u2019s better.  But you probably wouldn\u2019t be talking to me if you could.  \n\nGo for the mother board next.  See if it will post.  If it does, add the CPU.  If it still posts, add the memory.  If that works, keep adding until you\u2019ve reassembled the system.   Replace any parts that seem to not work or not work quite right.  \n\nI think you\u2019ll be out drives and a PSU and any screens.  Everything else I think can be salvaged.\n\nKeep an inventory on parts.  There\u2019s always going to be the possibility of corrosion over time. Shouldn\u2019t be an issue before the normal upgrade time but it can help if you\u2019re having some weird flaky issue five years from now and realize you\u2019re still using the memory sticks from this immersion.",

Root comment already retracted it but I want to reiterate that you should never use a hair dryer on electronics as it can statically charge the air. Heat guns made for electronics are way different than hair dryers. Let it dry for quite a while. Be generous with that isopropyl. You don't want to use something with too much water in it as that counteracts what you're trying to do here in forcing any remaining moisture (after the distilled bath, again be generous to get rid of disolved solids) to evaporate. You'll obviously need to separate the cooler from your GPU and reapply thermal paste, obviously do the same for CPU and main board. You might consider replacing the power supply. If anything goes wrong there the rest of your machine could get fried. Hopefully you have nvme as that will be ~easier~ possible to clean vs a hard drive. If you have any questions please let me know. Oh and let the components dry. I'm being overly cautious here but I'd let them sit for a week to be safe. It's humid as balls here though so it would take a while for me.",

Isopropyl alcohol isn't conductive, actually neither is water it's contaminants in the water that are conductive, and should help clean out the tap water contaminants.\n\nEdit: one last thing: you may want to take the hard drive in for professional repairs anyway, because depending on the model it may be hard for you to take it apart, clean it, and put it back together.",

And reassemble with thermal paste ( the good stuff, like kryonaut or equivalent) and get some new thermal pads for the memory. Put the whole thing back together again, it should be as good as or even better than new.\nBasically all your parts in there are solid state and should be okay. Maybe your fans will need replacing and that includes the power supply but motherboard, cpu, nvme, gfx card should all be just fine after a good clean up with the proper chemicals.",

I find that an air compressor is the easiest way to dry everything off and it blows off most contaminants, as well as getting fluid out from under the bga chips. (very important. Salt deposits there can ruin your day very quick)\n\nThen power it up in steps. (the point of this is that if the previous component is fried, you don't fry other possibly good components with it.)\n\nI likely would get a new power supply if the current one wasn't super expe sive. Don't play around with water damage and high voltage.\n\nKeep the cpu, ram, the nmve ssd/s, and gpu unplugged from the motherboard/system. \n\nPower up the motherboard first without the cpu or ram. It *should* twitch/spin any connected fans,(connect up a case fan) possibly flash some error leds or buzzer. (but may also not do anything. Basically, if it doesn't let out smoke, it's probably fine) \nThen add the cpu. It should be angrier at you. Beeping or flashing error lights about no ram. It is definately alive now\n\nThen add the ram. It should boot to bios now. If you got that down, you can probably add the nvme ssd and it should boot to the os. \n\nThen it is probably safe to try out the gpu. If you have access to a cheap older computer, it may be worth trying it out in that to see if it works/won't damage the host system.",

I work as a mental health clinician in Australia and it sounds like you had yourself a run in with a severely under-medicated individual.  when you have someone who gets this fixated and paranoid it can often lead into actions and events far worse then what you have experienced. By the sounds of it you have been lucky. Mental illness doesn\u2019t mean someone will become violent however when someone becomes fixated and paranoid about someone in close proximity that often will.\n\nCertainly go through all legal processes open to you, don\u2019t hold back. This individual needs help and the way he will get that is through assertive treatment. Assertive treatment doesn\u2019t necessarily mean him getting locked up but it will mean the mental health services will take his situation more seriously.\n\nI hope you get reimbursed for the damages and he gets the help he needs.\n\nEdit:1\nI just want to clarify. Since a lot of people are posting. \nHaving a mental illness does not mean a person will be violent or dangerous. My comment is primarily about the paranoid fixation which in itself might not result in violence however when left unaddressed can.\n\nEdit:2 anyone who claims the landlord is not mentally ill needs to stay in their lane as they clearly don\u2019t know what they are talking about. OP has provided more than enough information to come to a sound conclusion.\n\nEdit3: vote for universal healthcare.",

Also, no, do not bury it in rice, manually remove it and use some sort of powered air device blow it out until it is bone dry. Cans of compressed air probably won't do the job unless you have a lot of them.\n\nYou're probably going to need to tear down the PC, open up the GPU, replace any thermal pads and paste, and I'd definitely replace the PSU, Ram \\[you might be able to save this too, but I'd replace it anyway\\], and probably any drives.\n\nThe CMOS battery on the Mobo will also need to be replaced.\n\nThe PSU might be salvageable, but I wouldn't want to risk missing a bit of moisture or corrosion and frying everything else due to a short.\n\nAssuming nothing was knocked off of the board, if you get it dry it should be fine.\n\nThe GPU and CPU should be salvageable at least though assuming they just got wet and nothing more.\n\nDocument everything, itemize everything, take pictures of the condition of every part, catalogue the damage, and write a journal with dates and times for everything that happened and happens in the future with your landlord. This will be invaluable if you need to go to court.\n\nEven if your GPU and mobo are salvageable, you're still probably going to want to take your landlord to court and file a police report. Though it will probably be small claims court if you can salvage the GPU, CPU, and Mobo.",

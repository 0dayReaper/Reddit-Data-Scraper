    "postText": "I just built my new PC and I've encountered several issues with it.\n\n* The PC periodically makes a very loud \"whirring\" sound. After taking off all the panels and putting my ear to every component with a moving part I believe the source of the sound is the PSU. While the sound is not constant, it is so loud that it's impossible to *not* hear it. I can hear it even when the fans are running full blast, with my headphones on, while playing a game. It's that loud.\n\nI also hear a faint buzzing sound coming from the PSU, which at one point for a brief period became so loud that I didn't even need to be close to the PC to hear it. I'm a little concerned that the sound could be indicative of a bad PSU, but I wanted to ask first before I go through the trouble of replacing it.\n\n* The second issue is that my PC can no longer boot into the BIOS. If I spam F2 or DEL, the BOOT &amp; VGA lights on the motherboard will turn solid amber and then the PC will just sit there while the fans run full blast until I turn it off. If I do nothing while the PC is booting, it will boot to Windows every time with no issue. It also completely skips the BIOS splash, so I can't just wait for it to prompt me to hit F2 or DEL.\n\nThis also happened when I built the PC outside of the case for testing, but it only happened once and I was able to access the BIOS afterwards, so I assumed it was a fluke. It will also happen when attempting to run certain programs that require a restart, such as the Windows Memory Diagnostic. If I choose to restart the PC to run it, the lights will turn amber and the PC will fail to boot.\n\n* The third issue, and the one that concerns me the most, is that after a while of using the PC it will randomly start to lose functionality bit by bit. I first noticed it while trying to search for something in Windows. It would type the words, but no results would appear. After that more weird stuff started to happen, like programs or folders failing to open. Pieces of context menus would stick around after clearing the menu. Smooth scrolling would stop working. Eventually the only thing I am able to do is move the mouse around, but clicking and typing does nothing.\n\nIf I attempt to shut down the PC at this point, it will restart instead. This will fix the issue temporarily, but it has happened several times and I am positive it will happen again.\n\nI have no idea where to begin troubleshooting this, so I figured I would ask for help here.\n\nHere is my current build:\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/v2T3Kp)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3hyH99/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-42-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000910wof) | Purchased For $449.00 \n**CPU Cooler** | [Thermalright Frost Commander 140 95.5 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bnC48d/thermalright-frost-commander-140-955-cfm-cpu-cooler-fc140-white) | Purchased For $57.89 \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock B650 PRO RS ATX AM5 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zFzhP6/asrock-b650-pro-rs-atx-am5-motherboard-b650-pro-rs) | Purchased For $189.99 \n**Memory** | [G.Skill Ripjaws S5 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/tbYmP6/gskill-ripjaws-s5-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-f5-6000j3040f16gx2-rs5w) | Purchased For $114.99 \n**Storage** | [Intel 600p 512 GB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/w34NnQ/intel-600p-series-512gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-ssdpekkw512g7x1) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Storage** | [Crucial P5 Plus 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VZWzK8/crucial-p5-plus-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-ct2000p5pssd8) | Purchased For $126.59 \n**Storage** | [Western Digital Caviar Blue 1 TB 3.5\" 7200 RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MwW9TW/western-digital-internal-hard-drive-wd10ezex) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Video Card** | [MSI GAMING X GeForce GTX 1080 8 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/XC648d/msi-video-card-gtx1080gamingx8g) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Case** | [Fractal Design North ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Pmytt6/fractal-design-north-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-c-nor1c-04) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Power Supply** | [Corsair RM850e (2023) 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4ZRwrH/corsair-rm850e-2023-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-cp-9020263-na) | Purchased For $129.99 \n**Monitor** | [Dell AW2723DF 27.0\" 2560 x 1440 240 Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ssH7YJ/dell-aw2723df-270-2560-x-1440-240-hz-monitor-aw2723df) | Purchased For $612.49 \n\nThe GPU, the HDD, and the Intel SSD were brought over from my previous build which they have been working without issue for six years. The SSD has Windows 10 on it. The motherboard was updated to version 1.24, and XMP was enabled afterwards using the included pre-made profile. Those are the only changes I have made.\n\nIt looks like the RAM, the Intel 600p, and the HDD are not on the motherboards QVL list. I was told that didn't matter, but I've also heard otherwise.",

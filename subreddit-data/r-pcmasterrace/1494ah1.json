    "postText": "My pc that I built has an extremely loud and annoying fan. It cools fine but this stupid whirring sometimes happens.\n\nI checked for any wires any of the fans might be hitting and there is absolutely nothing. After investigating I found that the cpu fan was the one doing the noise and only at a certain rpm range. I took it off and tried to clean it but I can't properly clean it without compressed air or disassembly.\n\nAny ideas on how to fix it? It spins smoothly when I removed it, but it wobbles very slightly.",

    "postText": "Just recently built my first pc. GPU RTX 4070, CPU i7-13700(non k), B760 Tomahawk DDR4, 27in 1440p monitor running at 120Hz. Diablo 4 came with the purchase of the GPU. When I open the game up and sitting in the menu I noticed that my FPS is around 75(was expecting better). My GPU utilization is at 99% while my CPU is less than 10%. Is this normal or do I have some settings I need to adjust somewhere?",

By doing thorough research and comparing prices, you can often find deals and discounts on components, potentially reducing the overall cost. Additionally, building your own PC gives you the flexibility to upgrade or replace components in the future, saving money in the long run.\n\nBuying a pre-built PC: Buying a pre-built PC is generally more convenient as it saves you the time and effort of researching and assembling individual components. However, pre-built PCs often come with a markup, as manufacturers need to cover their costs and make a profit. While there are budget-friendly options available, they may compromise on certain specifications or use lower-quality components.",

If you are planning to purchase a pre-build, I would look up guides on how to purchase the **right** pre-build for yourself. Some pre-builds that you see being sold online take advantage of inexperienced users by spending more on the RGB  to look appealing than the components inside, hampering performance. Some prebuilds may cheap out on the necessary hardware like the motherboard, RAM, and PSU to cut costs, which can hamper your performance.",

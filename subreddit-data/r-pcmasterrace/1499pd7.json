But do keep in mind that the cost for it will add up with accessories. Such as a dock. An SD card for easiest form of storage. (Especially if you get the 64gb model) And any other peripherals. And if your not extremely delicate with your personal electronics, you could find joystick drift an issue much sooner than anticipated which may require repair either through the manufacturer or the diy with aftermarket. I personally have been enjoying mine.",

[Here is one of his recent videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxw4-SfeR6w) using ChimeraOS on a device that fits your budget. I would recommend, like he mentions in the video, to wait for the 7000 series variant as it'll have much better gaming performance.",

It's a 2012 GTX 660 Ti that I got for \u00a350, and I'm able to get most 3A games I play on 60 FPS Med/High or 30 FPS High (like FH4).\n\nSince you would be playing FPS or MOBAs, get a strong processor with a decent gpu, since they would be CPU bound rather than GPU bound. I have a 5600X and I get 300-400 FPS in Valorant, 240+ in CSGO and unlimited in LOL.",

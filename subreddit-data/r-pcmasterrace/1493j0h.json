    "postText": "Hey guys this is for people that have ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition but it applies to many laptops that uses liquid metal cooling. After months and months of research I found out the issue on why the laptop keeps crashing (I work in hardware retail shop in EU and this specific laptop has been refunded and sent to RMA too many times)  \nIf the laptop is sitting in any way but horizontal the liquid metal seeps out to the sides not covering the die which overheats the laptop and it crashes. This happens even with laptops that are brand new if they have been laying vertically in the storage from the store you bought it from for a long time. It also happens if you carry your laptop in a laptop bag a lot due to it sitting vertically.  \n**Fix, if you still have warranty send it to ASUS directly, if you have no warranty, reapply liquid metal (not advised) or Apply Honeywell PTM pad (works the best)**.\n\n**The issue &gt; Laptop shuts down inconsistently while playing games.**  \nThe advices that you can find on internet about this specific model with RX6800m did not solve this issue.\n\nHopefully it can help some of you and not waste months on this like we did.  \nWords to direct people for a fix to this sub.\n\n(AMD GPU Driver v27.20.22001.19001, AMD Control Panel, AMD Cleanup Utility, MyASUS, Armoury Crate, Adrenalin 21.9.2, random crashing, G15-G513QY)",

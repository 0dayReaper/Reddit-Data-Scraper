Like they were so far away I only saw them because they jumped and I noticed maybe 2 pixels move. They were exposed on the beach, I in the woods. They were 2 pixels on my screen open on a beach and I was deep in the woods on opposite shore.\n\nIt happened 2 or 3 times more after that, coming from different directions, each time I was in the woods and keeping low profile. As soon as I got in eyesight range, regardless of terrain and graphics and obstacles, instant kill. This was on 100% official servers only. So, yes, if not cheating then Jesus level inspiration.",

In fact, part of what caused a lot of our tribe to quit (and our eventual downfall) was Chinese hackers.  They used every hack in the book, as well as abusing the terrain mesh shit.  They were like a plague of fucking rats with their hacking and sheer numbers.  \n\nThat all being said, a lot of our top players and raid team could do the stuff you mentioned.  Turning your gamma up to make night time look like day time negates night time altogether.  Like, it\u2019s literally as bright and clear as day time when you do that.  Add to that people on adderall to stay up and PvP when needed, as well as a lot of these people being top players in other games, and you have some cracked out PvPers.",

I did a bit (1200hrs) of ark pvp but these issues killed it for me. Didn\u2019t help that our casual-chill server had an invasion from competitive ark players who seemed to hit headshots on people flying or running with 180% speed no problem.\n\nI can hit the same shots easily in csgo, valorant, or seige.

I probably wouldn\u2019t have known/remembered if you didn\u2019t mention it.  \n\nMost of ARK PvP is just getting an ungodly amount of hours doing it that any issues become trivial.  \n\nLike, in mega tribes, generally you have set groups of people who are your PvPers.  These are people who basically spend every hour of their free time hopping servers and raiding people.  In the same vein, we also had set breeders/tamers, as well as farmers.  Everyone could generally PvP, as they needed to be able to for defense as needed, but the PvP specific players were their own monsters.  \n\nI would say you are right with ARK combat being its own skill set though.  With how many variables there are with stats, it has to be.  The people who dedicate all their time to it though will destroy any person who doesn\u2019t.  It\u2019s one of the worst parts of the game if I\u2019m being honest, and allows for tribes to control things the way they do.",

You'll have an advantage for getting the drop on someone, but games with longer TTKs and movement tech can lead to that person just turning around and killing you instead.",

If there is an exchange of fire and you are still alive, it's a miracle often. Imho longer time to kill games are more demanding on aim accuracy for sure, but they leave a lot of space for lacking in other mechanics like map knowledge and movement mechanics. I disagree that having a longer ttk means you will have to be truly better than your opponent as Imho aim is not everything. A longer ttk will only make a sneaking attack useless as you have to also hit 20 shots before killing someone (exaggerations but you get the idea).",

One of my friends is very good at CoD, easily better than 95% of people I play against and I don\u2019t feel any pressure 1v1-ing him in private matches. I can beat him. But I get quite stressed and/or anxious when playing online, even against worse players I may be killed because I panicked or hesitated.\n\nSome people say you just need to play a game for hundreds of hours or thousands of hours for rush to go aways, but I think it\u2019s psychological and not about adapting to the game. I need to first reduce my actual anxiety that affects me day to day before I can play video games without anxiety.",

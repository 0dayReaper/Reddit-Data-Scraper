It\u2019s entirely about refining those motor movements until your brain has them mapped to specific motions with your body. So yeah. Bigger joysticks, but exactly the same mental mapping and muscle memory needed to translate thought into motion. The reason forklift accidents are so common is that most people coming in off the street to be an operator can barely operate a fork, much less map out mentally how to manipulate the world via power equipment.",

They develop the mental map and muscle memory to controller interface that I\u2019m talking about. Operating a wheelchair = operating an Xbox controller = operating a 40\u2019 boom forklift = driving an electric Cherry Picker. Pilots train in simulators. Forklift training should also be done in a simulator. Works perfect for people like OP that (normally) will have developed advanced control mapping and can operate an ROV like an underwater sub. This is not to fetishize people with disabilities or make light of their challenges. This is rather an acknowledgment that most of our world is now operated by keyboards and joysticks. And the people who spend the most time perfecting that interface, because they don\u2019t have much of a choice, naturally have way better skills than the rest of us.",

Please still be careful though as I'd hate to see it fall on you while you're leaning on it or something.",

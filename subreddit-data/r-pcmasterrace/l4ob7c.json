You can't trade them in for used credit or sell them with the old console.  That sucks. \n\nNot to mention this on PC games. Many titles have no or very limited physical-copy options.  If the gaming platform (uplay, epic, steam, origin, etc) tanks in the future, what will happen to those games?  What about when you're done playing them and you'd like to lend it or gift it to a friend, like this cool Gramps from the op?\n\nedit: grammar, typos",

With everything their are pros and cons, physical media can get damaged and lost and once its gone its gone, digital doesnt have that problem.

If you love PCs or want to learn about them, you can be part of our community!

They usually will throttle / cause an emergency shutdown at some point between 90 C and 100 C but likely would survive going significantly higher.  At least for short periods of time.\n\nUntil last year I was using an old Xeon processor from 2012.  It was the best processor for my motherboard due to the server processors going for a generation longer than the i7 line for that socket.  The CPU fan was having issues for the last 2 years I used it and the processor regularly ran at 90 C for hours at a time when I was playing games.  It didn't cause me any serious issues until I played Crusader Kings 3.  It was fine for a while, but late game wars were too much for it to handle at a reasonable speed.",

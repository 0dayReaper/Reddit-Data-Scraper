With sharpness, I've found some monitors will have cutoffs. Like slowly softening sharpness from 100-&gt;53, then a total change in how it's done at 52, then softening from there. Follow instructions on their sharpness test, and see how your preferences line up with their \"ideal\" values. I have a monitor with bad gamma, and it helped me find the balance of monitor settings and color profile to get it looking good.",

Figured out the majority of people or articles/yt vids that popped up have no sense of color and me, who literally is the last person you should ask about monitor/color depth calibration and so on did a better job than them. At least for my personal preference. Since mine had too strong greens and red out of the box so even white seemed green. Then it became too red, so I reduced red. So yeah, even if you're really bad at it just do it yourself. A good tip I went by is: \"Is this too green?\" - reduce green.  And apply the same to other colors. Also, a good tip  I've discovered -  most artificial image enhancers should usually be turned off.",

FALD displays are expensive because they can have well over 1,000 zones and each zone can have a different brightness. This impacts contrast which, in turn, impacts image quality.\n\nOn the other end of spectrum you have monitors with maybe 6 or 10 zones (sort of like a column) only. When one those zones changes brightness, you'll see the entire pillar / column dim instead of a small zone dim.\n\nNothing you can do -- it is a function of the screen. You only have a few zones.  Better, pricier screens have many more zones. The best screen would be OLED -- each _pixel_ has its own power and be on or off. Black = off. That's why you hear people at about 'infinite contrast' and 'inky blacks'.",

[http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/sharpness.php](http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/sharpness.php)\n\nIf you have 4k display, you may have 200% scaling or such. You may have to adjust browser scaling to 50 % to restore 1:1 pixel correspondence. That picture should look like 100% uniform gray if the image is rendered correctly, but that only happens if there is no picture scaling and no sharpening or blurring filtering happening. These things affect the result because of the nonlinear compressed representation of the colorspace's components, often called simply gamma though that is slightly incorrect. Because picture scaling and filtering algorithms never compute the nonlinearities correctly, this results in darkening/brightening of dithered patterns.\n\nI do keep all picture enhancements switched off. I use the other functions on that page to check gamma at various brightness settings, the sharpness, dark level, bright level and lack of gradient banding, all which are evidence of various issues that may arise from the GPU to display. With OLED screen, you can also enjoy flawless response time where pixels are basically equally fast to turn on or off, otherwise you can check which way it leans. Sometimes you can reduce the coloration in that test by changing the overdriving settings, I imagine.\n\nThe pixel walk scenarios show things like overflows in the pixel processing pipeline with dithering, or something such. I am not quite sure, but I only have seen couple of monitors that handle every pixel pattern without producing green or purple tinted regions instead of the uniform gray that is expected. This test is among the most challenging to get right result in, based on my experience.\n\nThe point of these tests is to allow you to explicitly verify that every enhancement built into the display is defeated and that it returns exactly the raw image, something that I think computer monitor should do. The word \"monitor\" implies accuracy and lack of signal processing enhancements like artificial vibrancy, local contrast boosts, and stuff like that. (You can't monitor properly if you are being lied to.) Sometimes even TVs can be turned into equivalents of computer monitors by carefully eliminating every enhancement they like to do from the menus.",

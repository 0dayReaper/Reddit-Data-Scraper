    "postText": "okay just before i start i want everyone to know that i am not a wizard with technology and i just want to play minecraft on my computer. the brand of my computer is Asrock.\n\n\n\nmy computer needed an update earlier so i decided to click the update and restart option for it, seeing as i wanted to play a game but i wanted to update the computer first. it took a long while to update and it also had a \u201ccleaning up\u201d process that went along afterward.\n\nwhen the computer reset the sign in screen started bugging out, the screen was gou bc black and it was glitching so i decided to hold down the power button and reset it. when i did i got the black screen of death and all i could do was move my buffering cursor around.\n\ni decided to restart it a few more times until i got the option to reset my pc, which i decided to. i chose the option where you can keep your files but the rest of the computer resets, however during some point while it was resetting the computer started going through an \u201cundoing changes\u201d process, which i thought was part of the reset but it wasn\u2019t and it took me back to the original reset your pc screen.\n\nat this point i was getting annoyed so i decided to reset it again, and it went through the same process but this time it had just brought me to the \u201cAsrock UEFI\u201d screen. for context, as i mentioned, my computer is asrock.\n\ni exited out of the uefi but my computer started going into a never ending loop of \u201cyour device has run into a problem, we\u2019ll reset for you\u201d and this is where i currently stand. \n\nTL;DR: my computers suffering immensely, is it time for a new computer?",

    "postText": "Hello there,   \n\n\nI currently am owning a: \"MSI Optix-MAG271CV\" Monitor that came as a gift with the new PC that i have recieved from a friend.   \n\n\nNow i have been playing a somewhat old game and just noticed that of course for it's time, details are going to be blurry. I tried going with something that was recommended to me, which was to go into the game's files and push up the resolution higher than what the game has to offer. My Pc could definetly handle it.  \n\n\nThis did work well, but the details were only really visible to like, 5%?  \n\n\nSo, then i head that you can go for a custom resolution through the Nivida Control Panel. I did this for 1440p and my monitor has flawlessly shown me the image.  \nYet im sceptical. I heard that pushing your monitor beyond it's resolution of origin could ruin the monitor and damage it to it not working anymore. Is that true for my monitor?   \n\n\nShould i go with that resolution or not?",

Try it and see if it makes a difference for you.\n\nEdit- OCing the refresh was more common before higher refresh monitors where the norm, it was a risk/benefit gamble.",

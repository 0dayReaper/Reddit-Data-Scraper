Battery is terrible, switches are better, etc. any advice from someone that has a steam deck or both a steam deck and switch?\n\nEdit: thanks for all the advice.

            "comment": "As someone who\u2019s had a Switch since day 1 and got a Steam Deck near the end of last year, here\u2019s my thoughts on it based off of your post. Long comment incoming:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t work well with most games\u201d is a massive overstatement, in fact the vast MAJORITY of my PC library works. I have around 270 games on my Steam account, and out of that list I\u2019ve only run into about 2 games that didn\u2019t work and one of them now does work since I last checked it. You see, even if a game is marked as unsupported or unknown, the game might still run flawlessly as far as the average player would be concerned. \n\nUsing the site ProtonDB to check if a game\u2019s playability status is something I use often. Often times, if a game doesn\u2019t work out of the box, it\u2019s just a matter of going on ProtonDB and seeing what needs to be done to get it working. The biggest hurdle are multiplayer games with certain Anti-Cheat such as Destiny and Fortnite that could totally work but the devs don\u2019t allow it\n\nBattery life is admittedly somewhat poor but things can be adjusted to get better battery life. A power bank may be needed.\n\nAs for a Switch being better, the only reason I have my Switch still is to play games online with my friends and for Switch exclusive games, otherwise my Switch is not touched over my Deck.\n\nEdit: Slightly trimmed down my wall of text to be a bit more concise and shorter (still long lol sorry had a lot to say \ud83d\ude05)",

More and more games are becoming verified, and more developers are making games to work well on the steam deck. The few games that I can\u2019t play are competitive multiplayer games, and that\u2019s ok, because typically those your going to want to be at your main rig anyways. \n\nThe best part about my steam deck, is I finally have an excuse to go through my gaming back log. So many games I got years ago on steam sales, are the ones I find myself booting up most frequently. \n\nMost of the time I\u2019m playing I bed, but has proved to be great in other scenarios as well. Easily my favorite purchase in awhile.",

As well as the fact that the software is what makes the secret sauce in making sure the games runs as well as it does. Whereas the ROG Ally is using windows and I am pretty sure it's going to be great but the fact that it doesn't have the same amount of support the Steam Deck gives is worrying \n\n Also the trackpads on the Steam Deck are amazing especially in navigating the desktop environment. Idk how the ROG Ally will do without it but I'm pretty sure it's going to be fine.",

            "comment": "It depends what your expectations are. I use my steam deck all the time, primarily playing indies or older AAA games. I prefer to use my PC for modern/more demanding games but people do play those on the steam deck as well. Just know the newest games may not run 60fps at high settings. You will have to make compromises. Older games and less demanding games play amazingly though. Right now I\u2019m playing several games on the deck including disco Elysium, dragons dogma, dark souls remastered, and the outer wilds. All perform great with great battery life. An important note too is that many online multiplayer games are not currently supported on the steam deck. That may change in the future, but I\u2019d make a purchasing decision based on the reality now. You can look at the games you have and would want to play on the deck and see if they\u2019re supported. \n\nI have a switch as well but I barely play it. I picked it up for the first time in over a year to play totk. The switch is a great device but it just doesn\u2019t have the games I want to play. My steam library is far more compelling to me than what Nintendo offers. If I was buying now and picking between the 2, I would absolutely get the steam deck. But it depends on what games you want to play. Both devices are great for what they offer. It\u2019ll be up to you whether or not their use cases fit what you\u2019re looking for.",

Unlike the battery.\n\nIf you're a mobile gamer and need a handheld gaming device, the Deck is fucking amazing.  And it can run a full Linux desktop, so I use it on my laptop dock connecting to a big screen and mous3 and keyboard and Bluetooth it to my ps4 gamepads at home to play on my big TV.  Then I can unplug it and bring it with to the toilet or wherever and keep playing.\n\nI wish I used mine more.  After I got it I realized how much I don't need a handheld at all anymore and while I used it super heavy for the first month or two, I pretty much barely use it anymore as my $6k PC is obviously a lot better, and I don't ride the bus or anything.\n\nI'm considering selling mine for that reason, but if you DO spend a lot of time on a handheld, this is the one I'd recommend for sure.",

It'll play indies for years to come and emulate basically anything at or under the Switch's power level. This doesn't even mention its ability to play a lot of AAA games, depending on settings. As a benchmark Fallout 4 on High gets good FPS, 60 in easier areas and dips to \\~30 in the difficult ones. Perfectly playable. Depending on use case the battery may be not up to snuff by itself. In my experience the low end is 2-3 hours for demanding games. You can tweak, of course, to make that number higher by playing with different settings and limiting watts. If you're an indie enjoyer you can expect much better battery life. I haven't had any trouble with running any of my Steam games, and beyond that there are incredibly straightforward tools like EmuDeck that make emulation a breeze. Also it's a fully-functioning PC that Valve is supporting very well. I'd say it's great, but if you want to exclusively run modern AAA games for hours without charging or investing in a battery pack then maybe it isn't for you. It all comes down to use case.",

At first my plan was to ocassionally play certain types of games from my Steam library on the couch, but it's surprising how much general use it's got. Depends on the game but it's something like a 60:40 split of PC to Steam Deck\n\nAs for game compatability, it's nowhere near as bad as people made out and was another pleasant surprise. I assumed maybe 50% of my games would work and I'd stream the rest to the Deck from my PC, but it's more like 95% of the games I've tried work well. Though it's true certain types of games with EAC won't run at all for example. Comments from others put it at at least 90% compatability and I'd bet money on at least 80% of anyone's library working well\n\nBattery life \\*can\\* be a problem, but as above it depends on the game. For AAA pushing it to the limit about 2 hours. But for less demanding titles, indie or older games you're looking at ore like 4-5 hours\n\nThe Deck is an emulation beast too, it's my favourite way to play PS2 games",

My switch has over-heated while playing in handheld mode, the joycons have both had to be replaced due to stick drift. No issues with the Deck. Other than the actual Nintendo games any other game you can get on the switch is available on Steam. The Deck gives you easy access to mods (playing modded Skyrim ATM), emulators, and can run games from other launchers (both blizzard and epic games launcher and games work). My best advice as someone that bought the top tier is to get the cheapest one. You can spend 20 on a micro SD card and expand the storage. You can also get a third party dock with more card slots for more memory. Way better than spending 300 on a switch.",

            "comment": "It's very rare that a game in my ~1700 PC games library doesn't work on my steam deck. Especially games that you'd actually want to play portably on a controller. It's a much more powerful device than the switch. You probably already have a games library as well but even if you don't the pricing between PC and Switch games is drastic. Switch games are much more expensive. You can subscribe to humble bundle choice for a year and get about ~100 PC games permanently for the price of about two first party Nintendo titles. I'd only get a switch if you really want to play the exclusives.\n\nIf battery is a great concern at a specific moment then just choose a more battery friendly game titles. You can get a lot of battery time then.",

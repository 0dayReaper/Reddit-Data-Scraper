As a barrier to entry, paintball isn't cheap but it can be cheaper to just show up and rent cheap equipment at the field. It would cost $300 in rental gear and lift ticket at a slope for ski/board. Rental gear and paint at a local field for me is $60.\n\nI'm lucky that I have a cheap field 5 minutes from my house, with an incredible community. You have former pros willing to play down to anyone's level just to get a wholesome game going. Assholes get kicked out.\n\nI played last year with some friends with a guy named Gator who was 70 years old and would kick our asses routinely and it was the best experience I've had on a course ever.\n\nThanks for reminding me I need to go up there this summer. For those who are getting into it, if you find the right place, you can just go and rent stuff and get away with a day for $60 per person, (less if you don't shoot a lot for paint) which is expensive, but I can't put another activity at lower $/fun value if you really enjoyed it.\n\nAirsoft is cheaper but there's more assholes and cheaters in my experience.",

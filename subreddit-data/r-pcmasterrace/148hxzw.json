Depending on your budget, I'd recommend going with an RX570 8GB or if you're willing to spend more, a newer card, like maybe an RX6600. Stay away from cards like the RTX3050, RX6400 or RX6500. They are only marginally better than a 13th gen Intel iGPU.\n\nAfter the GPU upgrade (you should really do those at the same time) you can upgrade the CPU. Luckily you already have a socket AM4 board, so there are a lot of options to choose from. With your current CPU, make sure your UEFI Firmware is up to date. Depending on what board you own, it might even support 5000 series Ryzen chips.\n\nBut even if it doesn't, the 3000 series also had a lot to offer. \n\nI'd recommend going with one of the 6C/12T models, like the 3600X or 5600X. You could also go for the \"g\" variants of those chips if you want an integrated GPU.\n\n\n\nAs an optional upgrade, I'd swap out the 1TB spinning rust with a nice and fast 2TB NVMe.",

Even if you got a 4090, the CPU and entire system bottleneck would be so massive that the GPU wouldn't be able to utilize more than 10% of its performance at best, I'd wager. It's a quite old system and no matter what you get for this generation, it will struggle with newer games.\n\nAdding another stick of 8GB DDR4 (exact same spec as the one you have currently, also same CAS latency and speed) will be best and also cheapest way to improve baseline performance and potential stutter issues. That 1030 is whack tho, 2gb and basically no computational power it may as well be an iGPU, that will hold you back the most long term.\n\nIf the PSU has been working fine, that's the only real carry-over I'd consider. These days you can get a 2 TB Nvme drive for next to nothing, as long as your motherboard supports NVME (which I'm certain your current mobo doesn't, but for future upgrade keep this in mind. Carrying over spinny drive is only worth storing image files and text documents on. Not applications and games etc).",

I've been in your shoes, and my biggest regret was getting subpar components instead of waiting even a couple months more for a better GPU.\n\nI'm also not seeing many comments that mention this but just upgrading your GPU without first upgrading your PSU is just asking for trouble, 600W is simply not enough in this day and age and you will need at a minimum 750W or even 850W if you want more room to upgrade. \n\nThat said, I have no idea what your financial situation is, but I used to only work a part time waiting gig while I was a student (earning \u20ac50 per function with some tips) and I could afford a decent mid range \u20ac1k PC after a year of saving up in 2018 (a GTX1060 and a 7th gen core i7 \\[forgot the specific model\\]).

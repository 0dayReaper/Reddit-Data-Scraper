I definitely broke a couple SATA cables running wires from the PSU because the hot swap bay bumps right up against them. Theres hardly even enough room for a PSU and cables in that spot, the only reason I was able to get everything together is because the PSU slides out the back on its bracket. It's not a bad case by any means but it's definitely not as nice as newer segmented layouts",

The other con was that you can't take water cooling on a plane due to the risk of pressure bursting the tubes, so I had to find the most high powered fans to fit my build. Last but not least, even with the highest powered fans, I had some parts overheat, so I now need to learn how to size and cut a hole in the metal to mount an additional fan.",

Fan fits to the CPU? RAM the right speed? Motherboard capable of SLI if you get two cards? PSU enough wattage?) is pretty much covered.",

What happened is the static in my body ran through the motherboard and overcharged it. You can ground yourself and take the static out of your body by touching the metal screw in the middle of some outlets. You could also get the anti static gloves. Those prevent you from doing what I did and stop smudging. Luckily, im 14 and i was building my first PC, and the motherboard was a hand me down from my dad. Anyways, now i get to get my own motherboard instead of the 15 year old, AMD Athlon X2 CPU, GeForce 6 GPU motherboard",

I just did a case swap from a prebuilt system that made it very difficult to switch things over and had to be pretty rough with the motherboard with no anti-static stuff and it still works fine. All that to say, you can definitely wear anti-static products to make your next build, but it may have been other factors that caused yours to mess up last time, so don\u2019t lose hope!",

            "comment": "Everyone says building a pc is so easy but looking at what parts I need and how to do it all is so fuckin overwhelming. The terms and names of parts just confuses the hell out of me. And then theres shit like thermal paste? Wtf is that? Do I need it? Theres so many other things like that. These hour-long pc building tutorials don\u2019t help either. I just feel like such a dumbass researching the parts and how to put it all together. I just wish PC\u2019s came like actual legos: All the parts in one box with a clear and easy instruction manual for dummies like me. It makes me really wanna just say fuck it and pay the extra premium for a pre-built. I just wanna play CP2077 damnit!",

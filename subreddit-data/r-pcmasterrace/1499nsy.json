The risk is no/reduced warranty or getting scammed with little recourse, or recourse with big headaches. Scammed as in they misrepresent the card or they know it's busted but still sell it to you and blame you for it not working.",

Might sell for 800$ in the future to upgrade for the 4090 when i got the spare cash. The price drop made it just about worth what it really should have costed in the first place so i was really happy with the purchase",

It all comes down to how well it\u2019s taken care of. \n\nThe one I got was from a miner who temp controlled everything, I\u2019ve 0 issues with it for a fraction of the price",

Also with the environment they are in its generally air conditioned. For me I bought a new Rx 6600 back when they were finally available for purchase I paid 500 cad for it. Better best bet whenever I wasn't on my computer it was mining. I had the core clocks slammed to the floor and vram running with a 100mhz oc. It still runs perfectly fine though isn't really profitable to mine on any more.",

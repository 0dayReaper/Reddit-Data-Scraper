They made smooth round beautiful things at a time where a lot of stuff was boxy and square.\n\nThey were about balance and handling, and the manuals came with neat info about the distribution of weight, and other physical qualities that stood outside of the engine/transmission.\n\nI\u2019m not an expert on the subject, but I do love old Porsches. They were never particularly known for engine performance or speed specifically. They were better known for being the most fun and greatest ride in the alps, and stuff like that. \n\nThey competed, they had race stuff, but rarely were they considered \u201csupercars\u201d like Ferrari or Lamborghini, although they had a couple models in the past that were made in that category, I can\u2019t recall.\n\nI know I want one, but I want an old one for the same reasons I might want a miata. \n\nIt\u2019s a VW engine in a small fun pretty csr. Nothing too crazy expensive or difficult to maintain. But so much fun, and those were the ones that sold the most.\n\nSee now: cayenne the ultimate rich mothermobile in denial of vans. Also replacement for Beamer real estate work cars. Not to be seen as the same as the classic Porsche obsessed person.\n\nDifferent roots all together.",

If someone can make an extremely efficient and powerful machine like a tractor, they likely arent clueless about vehicles. Having that experience and knowledge, combined with a bit of passion for fast cars? Seems like some serious potential to me.\n\nKind of reminds me how Sony and Nintendo used to work together. Sony wanted to make games on discs, but Nintendo refused and stuck with cartridges. Fast forward to Sony creating Playstation, fast forward more to Playstation/Sony passing Nintendo on sales/at least being fierce competition.",

He was extremely passionate to the point where it was a fault at times, and he only started building cars so he could find his own race team. Before building cars he was the team principal for Alfa Romeo, but he wanted to have full control without any interference, hence building and selling sports cars to fund his own team. Pretty cool in that respect if you ask me, but there were plenty of times he was a dick. Lamborghini understood mechanics, and if his clutch and steering were having issues you\u2019d be an asshole to blow off a customer. I guess they just had personalities that resulted in butting heads.",

What went down was that Sega came out with the Sega CD for their MegaDrive/Genesis and Nintendo felt the need to have a CD addon for their SNES. First they partnered with Sony as they had previously partnered on some advanced sound chips for the SNES. The addon they made was to be called the Nintendo PlayStation, and recently a prototype was found of this. Sony and Nintendo were going to announce this at E3. Nintendo, being Nintendo, had decided that they felt Sony was getting too good of a deal on the contract, so they went and made a contract with Phillips to try to create the CD addon. Only, they didn't tell this to Sony, who found out when Nintendo announced the partnership with Phillips on stage at E3. Sony had nothing in their contract that would prevent them from taking the work independent if the contract was broken, so that's exactly what they did. They removed the SNES cart port, redesigned the console and controllers somewhat, and gave Nintendo a big middle finger with their success.\n\nNintendo and Phillips also never finished making a CD addon for the SNES, and as part of the contract Phillips was allowed to make 4 games on their CD-I system using Nintendo Licensed characters to make back lost money from this. Nintendo went on to learn nothing from this and gave up on the idea of discs catching on for another generation.",

I used to work for them they're horrible\n\nComcast would go into a town that they wanted to expand to and they would tell the municipality. Hey we will provide you with free internet for fire, police, school. You name it. In exchange, we want you to enter language into the law that basically says we're the only people that can provide service here. It doesn't say that explicitly. Usually it's more like they have control over the poles or they need to approve anyone that buries wire so it doesn't mess with their service. But generally, the effect is the same. Competition has huge barriers to enter. Messed up right? It gets worse. These agreements usually only last up until the people they made the agreements with are out of office. Suddenly the entire government has to pay for the free internet, TV, and Phone service they were getting for free. The monopoly language in the municipal law? That stays in perpetuity of course.\n\nI remember seeing Powerpoints about their plans to raise prices four times a year admitting that the increase was pure profit and that distribution the increase throughout the year made them more money while lowering the chance people would notice or complain. Those price increases also had really bullshit names like\"FCC regulatory recovery fee.\" The fee was not a mandated government fee in anyway.\n\nThey also set up 2 year contracts  for all their products... The caveat? The price is guaranteed for one year of the contract. Your price increases mid contract. You can't cancel when you're price goes up (sometimes up to 20%). The price increases usually pretty large. Why you might ask. Because they actually set it up so that you call in to complain. A helpful representative will then tell you they can't  get rid of the increase, but there's a new Comcast package that puts you on a new two-year contract with a slightly less (But still  larger than what you were paying year one) fee.  And now you're grateful for the break and on the hook for 2 additional years\n\nI can go on and on but suffice to say Comcast is evil",

For under 2000 dollars, I have a bench top :lab' for a 10 subscriber fiber ISP. and then installing and splicing fiber.  If you have a township or a county to grant you permission to use their poles, you can string fiber optic with about $15,000 worth of equipment, including an old used bucket truck.  Fiber for GPON is reasonable, for my test setup, I bought 1 km of brand new, outdoor drop fiber for 200 bucks. Specifically for GPON, and that was small volume retail pricing.  Quite frankly, the hardest part is getting bulk bandwidth to your head end, and dealing with customers and billing.",

GPON takes more specialized equipment or hiring someone with specialized tools, WISP is much less infrastructure investment and makes sense for a smaller 5-50 person community, needing only a ladder, a high spot that everyone can see (with permission to use it) handtools, permission, and someone to sell bandwidth to the high spot.\n\nA WISP setup using Ubiquiti gear (UI.com) to service 20 people from one headend, including a proper router, and cabling, is ~2900 dollars retail, with up to gigabit delivered. /r/wisp/ has lots of info and options and opinions that are worth what you paid for them (Zero! :P)  But certainly valuable considerations.",

As they are in Hawaii and outside of reach of an ISP, it's probably a relatively low noise floor in 5ghz and 2.4ghz in their location.  Even back in the early 2000s (Native Hawaiian) we had really good broadband coverage.\n\nLicensed stuff is available, but becomes less and less appealing now that DFS is basically required for wifi now, ensuring REALTIVELY well behaved APs and clients.\n\nIf we're talking distances of less than 1km, on private land, with private poles,there's other options, including simple PtP fiber, vs fancy GPON and the like.",

At the main road, those neighbors have access to Spectrum, which does around 100Mb at the basic level, but they won't pull lines down to his and his neighbor's houses around him.",

There are also additional requirements that municipalities have to follow, such as holding public forums and submitting cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies.\"\n\nHe's not really being bothered right now because it's rural and multiple companies don't want to provide service there.  Honestly, this might be key to bypassing the loophole: create a county-wide organization, put up an RFP.  Since there won't be two companies that will want to cover an entire county in Michigan, boom, there you go.",

Anywho, it is limited by 12gb VRAM. i am currently using it at 1440p 144hz and it performs fine, I also have an AMD RX 6800 16gb and I love that GPU, Though it only peforms about 88% of the performance of the 4070. Personally, I\u2019d recommend the 6900 XT. Unless you want raytracing or DLSS frame generation. AMD will give you better performance without the use of those technologies be it FSR VS DLSS, aka raw performance.\n\nIf you care about heat or power efficiency and noise, you might have to think a bit more, goodluck! Both cards are great.",

            "comment": "Depends on the model of 6900XT. Board-partner models of the 6900XT, for example, are noticeably better than AMD's reference model 6900XT in my experience, which means a AMD reference 6900XT may not compare as favorably against a 4070 as an board-partner 6900XT. Also, if you're getting a 6900XT, I'm assuming you're getting it second-hand, which means you may not have a warranty for it anymore - or at the very least a shorter one. Also, most people compare the 6950XT against the 4070, not the 6900XT. The 6900XT is not quite as fast as the 6950XT, so 6950XT vs. 4070 comparisons will not be directly comparable to your situation.\n\nBasically, if you're looking at an AMD reference 6900XT vs. a 4070, I'd be leaning 4070, even though the 4070 has less VRAM. If it's a good board-partner 6900XT (like an ASRock OC Formula 6900XT, which is like god-tier), it's a tough call - I could lean either way depending on the particular model you're looking at.",

I'd say this is a toss-up. \n\nOn one hand, the 6900XT's 16GB of VRAM will help you play native-resolution games with high rasterization performance for longer than the 4070 might, and these cards are usually super tweakable in the default AMD adrenaline software, which can be a fun way to eek out even more performance from your card (I was able to get an extra 10% rasterization performance out of my 6900XT through AMD adrenaline software without noticeably higher temps or power consumption). \n\nOn the other hand, the 4070 gives you access to DLSS 3 (which may help the card's long term longevity), better RT performance, and lower power consumption (that's another thing to factor in as well - depending on your current PSU, you might need to upgrade that as well to accommodate a 6900XT).\n\nPersonally, I don't think you can go wrong picking either card in this scenario, assuming that this tier is the best price/performance available to you at this time. Good luck.",

The 4 games people keep bringing up run just fine on high settings on my 3070 in 1440p so it\u2019s blown way out of proportion. DLSS3, good power consumption and DLDSR for older games are well worth it imo over a 6900XT. But that\u2019s me, others will say different.",

I'm on 5700xt right now, trying Stable Diffusion and amd gpu is problematic to work with. The technology isn't there yet and I fill like it always have been that way since I bought mine gpu.\nDon't get me wrong, amd is a nice card, and will be nice for 95% of the time, but it's not \"better for less $\". Mb 6900xt vs 4070 is another situation.",

Dumbass amd provides same quality or very close quality with FSR which isn't the same as Dlss but is still great. Also has great performance without rt also raytracing is not the standered most games it bearly does anything while destroying your performance. Not everybody is a rich jackass like you.",

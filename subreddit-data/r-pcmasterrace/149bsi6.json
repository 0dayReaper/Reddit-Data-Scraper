            "comment": "This is a daisy chained 6+2 connector. This connector only has 2 connectors rather than 3. Running a GPU of these daisy chained connectors isn't ideal. PCPartPicker is making sure that your PSU has 3 independent cables for powering the GPU to ensure hardware safety and stability. You'll need to look at the product page of your PSU for details.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lckbntife06b1.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8b8c7adf84d7db2c1aecac7ab85a2c345b26f0ee",

A non-modular power supply will come with set number of pci-e cables already attached. \n\nMy suggestion and long term solution would be to by a higher wattage premium modular power supply. It will cost a bit more up front but the dependability and flexibility is 100% worth it. \n\nYou already have a modular power supply selected so good job on that front but I would increase the wattage to a 750w or even an 850w. 650w is adequate for the components you have listed but you will need to upgrade the PSU if you ever wanted anything more powerful. A higher wattage PSU will almost guarantee that you have enough pci-e connections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Quick Side Note:* If you are struggling with these terms and understanding what is needed you should absolutely go watch some Linus Tech Tips full builds and guides on PC building and buying. You will make better decisions and are more likely not to break anything while building.",

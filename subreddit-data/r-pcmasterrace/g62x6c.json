If I'm at my desk I have a dock- I plug in a single cable and get network, display, USB, SD card, and power. If I am moving around- I don't want to be plugged in. On the rare occasion when I need a physical Ethernet port I have a $20 dongle but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used it.",

If you\u2019re not torrenting and have common sense when browsing/downloading stuff, you should generally be okay. Lock when you\u2019re away.\n\nNumber two, if you\u2019re using chrome (not sure if Firefox has it) use uBlock Origin. Not uBlock. Make sure it\u2019s ORIGIN.\n\nAs for antivirus, Windows Defender is actually pretty solid, but as any antivirus, it\u2019s not perfect and there are other choices out there. The ones people usually name are Bitdefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and a few others.\n\nFor \u201csecond opinion\u201d malware scanners people say Malwarebytes (The free version, not the paid version which isn\u2019t that great) and/or HitmanPro.\n\nOne thing you should definitely do, is make an Admin account right away which isn\u2019t your own account. Remember its password/pin, and THEN make your own account using your Microsoft account if you choose, and make your personal account a non-administrator. \n\nThis way if you download something sketch on your personal account, malware might not be able to execute because it might need administrator privileges, which your account doesn\u2019t have by default. You\u2019d have to know the admin password/pin. Just an extra layer of security to think about.",

It could be going out but another factor I'm thinking could be the PSU too and my cables could be getting old and stuff.  But the computer it's in is so old that I don't think it's worth trying to like fix it or invest a bunch of money into fixing it lol.",

When I boot, everything turns on, but after the bios, my gpu fans stop spinning. When I game and the gpu gets warm, fans spin up. Not sure if this is what you mean though?\n\nThe display issue could be unrelated, monitor not set to the correct hdmi/display port. I get that when I swap laptop to desktop.\n\nJust hoping for you \ud83e\udd1e",

You can check this by (ofc remove card out pc first) using a continuity meter on the pcie power (check pinout online) to see if there are any shorts.\n\nIf there are shorts then it is probably the MOSFETs. You can open the card up and test MOSFETs but it will be very hard to repair and would most likely be cheaper to buy a new card.\n\nI have this exact same card and it died in the same way. I initially thought it was just a power supply issue, but tested the GPU in a completely separate pc and it was dead (PSU was fine).\n\nThere are a couple YouTube videos of a person attempting repairs for this issue, but they were not able to fix it as it needed complex tools etc.",

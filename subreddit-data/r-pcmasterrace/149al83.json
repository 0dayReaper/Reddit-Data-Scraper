When i turn the screen on and off it goes black again 2 or 3 times until it finally goes back to normal, tho even then it sometimes randomly goes black. I tried changing all the cables necessary, even changing monitors but nothing seems to work.\n\nI never had this issue, neither did the previous owner.\n\nAny idea on how to fix this?",

So does this mean that AMD cards are affordable?\n\nI went to BestBuy on a shopping trip to look around the other day, $500 was minimum price.  It's probably an improvement over what I have right now but $500 seems unreasonable to improve things given that I bought this for like $150 a long ass time ago.. I'm running an AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series.\n\nDoes anyone have a good suggestion to boost things for $200-$300 tops?  Is a used card the way to go?\n\nSorry not sorry for hijacking the thread (okay a *little* bit sorry).",

It seems like the only real deals are from people who used them to mine crypto, and they are getting out of the market. I've heard that a lot of the really used crypto cards at good prices have been ridden pretty hard over the years.\n\nOr, I dunno. Wait until the Government starts auctioning up FTX shit.",

I am not over here trying to overclock or play super intensive games, I just want a comfortable upgrade for the few games that I do play.\n\nLast question... Let's say the max amount I'm comfortable spending is $500.  Given that I'm running a 12th-gen-old card right now and I'm not really even pushing even that card to its limits with my current PC gaming habits...  I'm really not going to perceive any difference between that $270 card you linked and some other $490 card, am I?",

If you're gaming at 1080p and you're not looking to push for max settings and hit crazy framerates, you won't notice much of a boost by buying a more expensive card.\n\nThat said, if you spring for something a little higher tier, you'll be helping yourself future proof your machine a little bit (as long as you're okay staying with 1080p). Also you'll be able to push the graphics on some of the older games you enjoy playing, which is pretty fun after settling for medium and low graphics settings for so long.",

According to steam hardware survey, it's about 3% of people. With about 65% still on 1080p. 4k is literally 4 times the # of pixel as 1080. The hardware needed is WAY less. Also who in hell actually needs 200+ frames a second in anything? This is not a gotcha thing and not a stupid \"the human eye\" bullshit thing. I get 120+ but after that it's not needed in anything, so these cards coming out that are pushing games that aren't 4k Ultra into the 200+ range just aren't needed for anyone but 3% of users. On top of that the price tag is outrageous. SO yeah, gamers don't need or want them.",

Lol, $3k to rent the same house I'm already in. $4k+ for anything bigger.\n\nA whole ass generation is screwed even more than my generation was from the 2008 stuff.

Also all the triple a tittles coming out seem to be getting worse every year. Once they find their money making franchise these huge game companies just make altered versions of the same games. I haven't been able to enjoy a CoD game since way back in the Black Ops days. Everything is either a clone of some popular game is just a really neat concept that gets badly applied",

What this means is that bitcoin mints \"coins\" by producing a really long string of characters that your GPU has to guess. This is what people mean when they say mining. Each number guessed is a swing of the pickaxe, and every once in a while, you might get lucky and hit a rich vein of bitcoins. \n\nThis is very oversimplified. For example, there are pools where you combine your \"work\" together to get a share of the coins.\n\nEthereum worked this way too. However, the plan was, once there's enough coin in the world, to switch away from this kind of \"proof of work\" system (i.e. mining) to a \"proof of stake\" system where you acquire new coin by \"staking\" your coin. Think of it like earning interest on coin that you've set aside and promise not to use. There are mechanisms in place to facilitate this, and I'm not smart enough to explain those to you.\n\nThis happened in September, and there's no more mining ethereum.\n\nTLDR: Instead of mining ethereum, now you get more ethereum by staking the ethereum you already have.",

When your computer solves one of those problems first, it shows proof of work and gets the coin reward. It takes more energy and resources as time goes on when the calculations get increasingly difficult.\n\nWith proof of stake, you put a certain amount of coins on deposit. The network selects who gets to do the calculations based on how much you've staked, basically how many coins you put in and how long they've been there. The selected \"winner\" gets to do those Blockchain calculations, then other people verify that they were correct. Once verified, you and the verifiers get rewarded in coins proportional to the work done and the stakes everyone had.\n\nIt's all complicated and hard to break down, but I hope this helps.",

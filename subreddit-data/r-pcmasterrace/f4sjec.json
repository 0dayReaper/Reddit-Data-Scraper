I'd like to tell you 2 things:\n\n1 - Everyone is welcome here, provided you're a chill person who doesn't mind occasional tongue in cheek humor.\n\n2 - In case you are not a PC gamer because you think doing so is very expensive, please know that it is very possible to build a competent gaming PC for 500 dollars or less. Please check out http://www.pcmasterrace.org for our builds.\n\nFeel free to use this community to post about any kind of doubt you might have about becoming a PC gamer or anything you'd like to know about PCs. That kind of content is not only allowed but welcome here!\n\nYou too can be part of the PCMR! You don't necessarily need a PC. You just have to love PCs. It's not about the hardware in your rig, but the software in your heart!",

I took it apart, cleaned, and fixed it but not for long.  I wasn't going to spend that again, but I found the exact same one on eBay for 1/10th the price that was about new and someone was getting rid of.  Used that for a year or two, and exact same problem.  Only thing I like is having 2 buttons on the left, AND two buttons on the right side, where most just have the two on the left.\n\nOh, their warranty is even better.  Ever want to utilize it?  Spend 1/2 the price of the device to ship it back somewhere in Europe and wait a month or two.",

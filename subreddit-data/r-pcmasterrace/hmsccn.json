Seems like they\u2019re actually trying to listen to feedback for improvements, along with better understanding how to capture a broader slice of the midrange phone and computer markets with somewhat more affordable offerings that are well targeted and don\u2019t diminish the premium image they still look to push.",

According to their media, the police have reviewed surveillance cameras, which showed him walking up to the top of the 7th floor alone. The rooftop also has a 130cm-tall railing. Ergo, they are not looking at external factors at this moment.\n\nPolice also found heart medication in his office, but no suicide note. His family disclosed that he was suffering from high blood pressure &amp; other cardiovascular diseases, &amp; have relevant medical records. They acknowledged that there were some family quarrels recently, but not to the point of causing suicidal thoughts. His family has agreed to cooperate with investigations.\n\nMSI had also released somewhat cryptic statements, saying his death was due to \"personal health factors\" (\u4e2a\u4eba\u5065\u5eb7\u56e0\u7d20) &amp; had nothing to do with the official business. Taiwanese netizens are baffled by the choice of words.",

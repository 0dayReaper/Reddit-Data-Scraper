    "postText": "So here's the thing, I've always been team green. And now it's time for a new rig since mine is pretty outdated now. I'm really sick of Nvidia's low Vram bs they've been pulling as of late, but man that DLSS3 is looking pretty delicious rn. I was dead set on getting an AMD gpu now but after some googling it seems they don't have Frame gen? It's literally the only thing standing between me and AMD right now. Imo the frame gen seems more future proof than the extra Vram that you get with AMD. I've read that FSR3 or whatever it is, is supposed to get the frame gen. Is it true? Would that be compatible with let's say something like a 6950XT? Also just to be clear, I don't care even a lil bit for RTX shadows and reflections. I'm looking for best looks/performance so to me RTX ON isn't important. Also if it even matters, I plan on playing on 1440p144Hz monitor and 4k60Hz TV. I've been a little out of the loop these past few years in the GPU world, so I'd like advice from you guys.",

AMD is working on all of that stuff and chances are they will add their own version of any gaming focused features nVidia adds.\n\nThe main reason for choosing nVidia would be if you need nVidia proprietary things that can't be used efficiently on AMD, such as CUDA, which is a feature that doesn't get used in gaming.",

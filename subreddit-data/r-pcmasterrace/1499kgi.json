It just had \"extend drive\" option grayed out.   \n\n\nBasically like this but grayed out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3h4m4bw906b1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98b9caebfd469cdfc2b73b1248f03b1688267b14",

Native disk management can only extend to the right and no partition can be in between the partition you wish to expand and the understood space. You already did it right. Use third party software to move that partition out of the way (eg to the end of the drive) so it pushes the unallocated space to the left. Next to the c partiton.\n\nCurious to know what that partition was.",

    "postText": "I haven't been able to record this issue since it happens so randomly, and it only happens once a day, though not every day. I have youtube on pretty much all day, and sometimes the entire PC will just get a stroke and lag for like half a second, mostly noticeable because the music slows, it doesn't stop, just slows, then continues working as normal.\n32GB of DDR4 3200mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM, R5 3600, RTX 2070 Super, you could say the RAM is underclocked because the target frequency is 3600 but my MB does not support 3600. Hardly think it's a hardware issue, and it doesn't even happen while gaming, just listening to music, working or browsing socials.",

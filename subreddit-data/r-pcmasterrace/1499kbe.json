    "postText": "This might have already been confirmed or debunked but it seems that computers compatible with Windows 11 do not get the 22H2 update for Windows 10.\n\nMy laptop is compatible with Windows 11 and has been in the 21H2 update since it came out, and I can't seem to get the update no matter how many times I make it search for updates.\n\nMeanwhile, my older laptop that doesn't meet the minimum requirements for Windows 11 has the 22H2 version of Windows 10.\n\nI have also tested with 2 friends this theory.\n\nOne of them has a W11 compatible desktop, but he disabled TPM 2.0 and he has gotten 22H2, the other simply had an older incompatible laptop and has also gotten 22H2.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because 21H2 will have its last security update this June according to Microsoft, while 22H2 will still be supported until 2025.\n\nIf this is the case then yet again Microsoft is trying to force us into Windows 11 unwillingly by not giving security updates to those who can get it.\n\nIf that's not it, then my laptop is just dumb I guess",

Was on 21h2, win update offered to install and downloaded 22h2 but would error out during install process after the 1st reboot, and would end up back on 21h2.\n\nThe 22h2 update assistant was successful in installing it.",

That IHS distributes not just the heat, but also acts as a protective cover for the fragile silicon chip, by spreading the high mounting pressure of the CPU cooler over a large surface area, preventing cracking of the die.\n\nBare silicon dies, such as the ones on laptops and GPU PCBs, requires different mounting systems, and they have very low tolerances for any sort of uneven mounting pressures. Too much torque on the screws, uneven mounting pressure, or anything of the sort, and say goodbye to your hardware as the chip cracks in two and never works again.\n\nIn other words, be very careful and learn how to work with the GPU's mounting system first, if you want to mod your GPU.  The mounting pressures of an AIO is simply far too high for direct die cooling, so you need to not only adapt the mounting system (due to differences in both where the screw holes are, and the difference in z-height), but also make sure you can fine tune the mounting pressure so as to not crack your GPU die.",

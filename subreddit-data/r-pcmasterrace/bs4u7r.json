Twice... okay, sure, but please remember what I said last time, and let's run through the steps once more.  Three times is starting to become a problem, and I'm going to have questions of my own about whether you're grasping what I'm trying to show.  Five times or more... it's clear you're not interested in learning, you just want things to be done for you.  Eight, eight, I forgot what eight was for.",

If all that's plugged in is one cable in two spots, no input means no loop. But, if you have a couple other cables, then every single thing that goes into the hub will loop around both ends of that cable, and reenter. Of course, each end of that cable will also get what the other sent over again, so if you have 1 cable in port 1, and another in 2 and 3, then send a single message through the first cable, the looped one will forever repeat that one message. Annoying, but a network can handle that usually. The real issue is they will do that for every single message that goes onto the network, that will quickly choke the whole thing in real world scenarios.",

I don\u2019t mind helping, but when I look at the screen and can figure it out in 3 seconds of looking around, it seems like you didn\u2019t even try. The other day he asked me how to tweet. He made an account on Twitter and followed people, but couldn\u2019t figure out how to tweet... He\u2019s not computer illiterate either, he can use Word and Excel fine and can navigate websites to pay bills and post items on eBay. But he can\u2019t figure out how to tweet? Ugh.

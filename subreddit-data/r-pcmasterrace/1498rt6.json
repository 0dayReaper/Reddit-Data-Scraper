    "postText": "So quite often if I'm playing a game which puts a lot of pressure on my pc then I'll temporarily lose signal to the monitor, no it isn't the monitor or HDMI cable, I've tried changing both, I cleaned the pc and the problem still happens, my pc should be handling these games fine (battlefield, world of tanks, sons of the forest, etc) because I have a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, an intel i7-10700KF CPU and 16Gb of ram. My PSU is an MWE 700, not sure if I need a different power supply if this one isn't powerful enough or is maybe damaged. Additionally my side glass panel will get extremely hot (nearly painful to the touch), is this bad/could this be the problem? Any advice welcome, thanks.",

            "comment": "Try cleaning your GPU ports. Could be dust or something in the port? Try cleaning the PCB of the card if you have the confidence. If your front panel gets really hot then try rearranging fans (front should be intake and rear should be exhaust, but I assume you know this). Having a hot FRONT panel is weird. What case do you have?",

Additionally the two fans on the far right, the bottom one which I think is meant for the PSU does not work, came preassembled like that and I assume it is just not plugged in however on this case it is extremely difficult to get into the PSU, not as simple as just taking some screws out so I cant get in to plug the fan in :( \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f04mgcpk106b1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5296198fdf4e8bb98f6d9291d23a108bb78ca157",

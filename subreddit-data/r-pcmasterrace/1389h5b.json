The ambiance, the story, the quests, the style, the enemy ai (for the most part), the sheer fun of the game. All were just miles ahead of what I've seen out of Redfall. I was so hyped for Redfall because they were talking about it in comparison to Prey so much and then it comes out looking like a game they made before Prey was even a concept. I loaded up Prey after Redfall came out and it still holds up. Just so fucking disappointed. \n\nEven deathloop was more enjoyable than this heap.",

According to his wikipedia article, Rapha\u00ebl's later-given reason for departure was \"'creative anxiety' around delivering a triple A quality game *where it felt like more like making a product instead*, as well as wanting to take a break to focus on other matters\", which seems like a polite way of saying he had to fight Zenimax that wanted to release Prey as shovelware.\n\n[Prey's marketing was notoriously terrible](http://www.nmasercola.com/prey), which may have been an internal power struggle where people were trying to bully Rapha\u00ebl out of the company, or just a true misunderstanding by Zenimax of what the game was or 'should be' about (\"Don't people like action games like Doom or Skyrim (made by other subsidiaries of Zenimax)? Why couldn't they just have made a shooter?\").  Whatever the case, Arkane/Zenimax bungled Prey's release, and that was probably interpreted as a failure of the \"release quality games\" strategy.\n\nHarvey Smith, the creative director for Redfall, was also lead designer or director for Deus Ex, System Shock, and Thief. He is not incompetent, quite the opposite. However, it's likely that while Colantonio tried to fight for quality against Zenimax, he acquiesced.\n\nIn short: I'm going ahead and blame Zenimax.",

Then there are suddenly a hundred people on a game in the mid-00's, several hundred by the early-10's and now there's well over a thousand people involved in some AAA games. \n\nOf course you had better control over a project when \"talk to the coders about an AI bug\" meant turning your head and asking your buddy about it and not sending out an e-mail to six different studios spread across the world because QA couldn't determine if it was related to physics, level design, base AI code or a script interaction caused by a side quest.\n\nMemes like these irritate me because they fail to account for how much more complex game development is today even compared to ten years ago, let alone twenty or thirty.",

I already tried to install old Nvidia drivers for more stability but I found a solution at least for me: If you tried to lower the power consumption or temps on your Ryzen 7000 then try to change it to default in Bios, keep the EXPO enable, and launch the game. If this solved the issue then you can go back to the BIOS and try to make little changes to the volts until you find the best stability. Don't trust Cinebench or OCCT only when doing undervolts cause every game use your CPU and GPU different.",

If you didn't undervolt your CPU then I recommend you to do it. \nAlso check if your CPU can handle the frequency of your RAM for example my 7600x can handle up to 5200mhz so manually using 6000Mhz on a Corsair for example will generate issues.\nIf the problem still continues then you can deseable EXPO for good or even trying to play with 1 stick of RAM if this solve the issue then you have a faulty RAM.",

The weird deep fried effect has only happened twice, but I still don't know what causes it. I occasionally get blue screens for memory management (less so since I upgraded to 32gb, but still happens from time to time), so maybe that's what the issue might be? Definitely terrifying when it all happens",

It does now allow to support the important option1, and does allow dynamic block/allow rules to have precedence over static filters, and to also to properly implement precedence between rules themselves (though an actual prototype would tell whether I overlook something).\n&gt; \n&gt; However, it's still not possible to implement noop rules, which purpose is to ignore inherited block/allow rules and fall back strictly on static filters, and which is a key concept to dynamic filtering.\n&gt; \n&gt; Summary, latest version of declarativeNetRequest, as per documentation, still breaks dynamic filtering in uBO, due to the inability to implement the noop concept. Suggestions welcome if somebody can think of a way to implement noop rules which I am not seeing.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is also the issue of denyallow filter option, not supported by the declarativeNetRequest API. It might be possible to implement using negative lookahead complex regexes (which was what denyallow was meant to prevent in the first place), but given that the number of regex-based filters are further limited, this is another pain point of the declarativeNetRequest API.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, still no way to implement blocking according to response header content, so preventing the no-large-media-elements per-site switch, or the new experimental header= filter option. Also, no match for strict1p, strict3p, and so on as I looked more into the latest documentation.\n\nhttps://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-873602429",

It brings some good to the table, for one its faster than Firefox and as fast as Chrome seeing as its baked into the OS itself. Firefox has been shit to me along the whole year, browser feels outdated and slow. Chrome, don't bother....Even with enough RAM what's the point? It doesn't operate or launch as fast as Edge. Personally don't want Google having their hands on too much of my platforms.",

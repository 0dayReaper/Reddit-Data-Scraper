I\u2019ve found an RX 6800 XT for \u00a3530 online, or should I get an equivalent Nvidia (3080?) card?\nI understand that the RX has more VRAM but an Nvidia Card has the benefit of Ray Tracing and DLSS. Thank you for reading and for any responses :)",

When you turn on DLSS? 3070 is winning.\n\nI know its hard to swallow, but this is the truth.\n\nThe reason you dont understand this, is because AMD employs shills to come and propagate posts about vram (upvoting each other, downvoting anything against their shilling, etc), so DLSS continues to be minimized. It is AMDs nightmare for DLSS to be considered when purchasing, because this indeed DOES mitigate much of the cost between them. You are starting to see this with Diablo 4.\n\n-Diablo 4 goes from 80-90 fps 1440p, to 144fps and does not drop a frame the entire game, with DLSSq, and I sh*t you not, it looks better. https://imgur.com/a/g7RPq3Z",

I'm more convinced by Nvidias PR monopoly that made you think you need DLSS, you don't and most games don't even support it. I don't care that you turn on DLss and everything seems stable, I want stable without loosing quality so I would go with 6800xt. I don't like diablo 4 btw, looks like a massive flop and bare bones game atm. Rather play diablo at 60fps max settings than 144 with dlss, because it ain't fast paced, first person shooter where FPS is necessary, wouldn't be surprised that console plays it on 40fps more or less and it's still good.",

Its immediately apparent and imo not usable.\n\nMany people also dont realize that using DLSS at 1080p doesn't really show you much. Performance mode has too low of a base resolution (540p) to look acceptable, so at 1080p you just \"throw on\" quality mode.\n\nMoving to 1440p, the base resolution of performance mode increases to 720p and this is where it starts to REALLY show its magic, because you are putting the tensor cores to work.\n\nRemember: 1440p DLSSp &gt; 1080p DLSSq on the same screen size, because the base resolution is the same, with 1440p DLSSp having a higher reconstruction output.\n\n*One can actually get a higher resolution monitor for a performance increase, because you put those cores to work.",

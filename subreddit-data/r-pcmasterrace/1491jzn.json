But if he upgrades to a 4070 or 69x0 it's an 80-90% uplift.\n\nSee this video for CPU scaling:\n\n[i5 12600K vs i5 11600K vs i5 10600K vs i5 9600K vs i5 8600K vs i5 7600K | PC Gameplay Tested - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZoHY4CpR20)",

And upgrade too either AMD or Intel's latest platform with DDR5 and also upgrading the gpu together is probably a better move in the long run.",

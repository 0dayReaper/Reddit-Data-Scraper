I know this is kinda flipping the script where you're watching people get confused and being confused with them but realize that this whole thing is meant to catch people who are confused by their confusion because a lot of americans don't see the problem with our healthcare. Luckily childbirth is an easy one to subsidize but the rest of the things mentioned not so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf not for my income being low enough to qualify for medicaid (the USA NHS for very poor people) for my fiance (I make too much for me to be covered, only my fiance and our kids qualify) my first son would've cost roughly 38k in cali and my second just shy of 32k in Texas including the hospital stay and everything involved with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy fiance was once prescribed Copaxone, a MS med she was supposed to take daily in 20mg doses. A month supply is roughly $7500 USD. Gilenya is also for MS but it was studied as a possible treatment for CoViD early on and that runs $9000 for a monthly supply. These are meds many people with MS have to have to prevent flare ups that can literally paralyze them and  they cost more in a year than 90% of income earners make in total. Its a shit show.",

Best advice for anyone getting hospitalized in the US without good insurance coverage is to get the fuck out as fast as you can if you don't require hospital equipment. it is actually cheaper to pay for private care at home unless you're at poverty level, in which case the hospital may waive costs if you send them your tax returns.",

I work in VFX though and really really need the VRAM so that's what the purchase was about.\n\nBut yes for gaming I really don't think anyone would benefit much from a 3090 vs a 3080...for now. I'm sure though in a few years we'll be seeing titles that use a lot more VRAM, especially with UE5 coming out featuring all of this dynamic geometry sourced from extremely high rez meshes. I would have to guess that the more VRAM you've got, the higher rez the meshes will be.",

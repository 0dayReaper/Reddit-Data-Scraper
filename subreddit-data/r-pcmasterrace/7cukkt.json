Mods are investigating and will remove this thread if we are able to confirm it.\n\n[Alternate way to refund games, including pre-ordered ones.](https://imgur.com/gallery/h6CRz)\n\nFrom the article:\n\n&gt; The refund button never existed for pre-ordered games in the first place. Seriously, there are [forum posts going back years](https://answers.ea.com/t5/Technical-Issues/How-to-cancel-a-Pre-order/td-p/575490) from people not being able to get refunds on their pre-ordered games, and being told to go through customer service, instead.\n\n&gt; Alternatively, you can wait until the game launches, at which point the refund button will appear and you can click it for a one step easy refund. **Basically, the refund button is present for released titles, not pre-ordered ones.**\n\n---\n\n[Here is EA's response.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7cukkt/ea_has_removed_the_refund_button_from_their/dpt55la/) \n\n----\n\nLearn about [us and our history](https://pcmasterrace.org/history).\n\nPCMR isn't just a subreddit, but a very large community, founded in 2011 that is ALSO on reddit.

Like every corporation, they'd light the people themselves on fire if they could make a buck and get away with it.\n\nEDIT: Clarifications for all the: Trolls, corporatocracy worshipers, paid shills, games-of-chance addicts, inexperienced, and \"bu bu but ..devs gotta eat too dude\", and finally morons.\n\nMy statement holds virtual truth if not current actual truth. In the sense that, any corporation that expects to become top dog, or ones that actually do become top dog. ALL of them yet again I state: Would burn you all to pieces if they could get away with it, and there was monetary incentive. For them not to be of that mindset is a flat out guarantee they could NEVER be in the circle of the top performers on Wall Street, investors will simply look elsewhere. This is what true unbridled competition breeds, not the PeterPanDreamLand fantasies eloquently nurtured to you by your elementary school, all the way to college; educations. Why does fiduciary responsibility for profit first and foremost confuse people so much? What do you honestly expect at the end of the day when the legal clause as a corporation abides by that responsibility first and foremost?\n\nSo please don't message me with the obvious \"Are you serious dude, NOT EVERY CORPORATION IS LIKE THAT\". I don't have the patience to debate word games/semantics/diction gymnastics. If you run your corporation, and never reach the levels of criticism I've erected. You can pat yourself on the back knowing you are worthy of sainthood, or you simply never were cut out to be in the top tiers of business, or had aspirations to. Not that; that's a bad thing or anything.",

They hire cheap tech support, as cheap as they get, and don't give a shit.  The problem is not the game developers who pour their talents into things, it's the decisions made by MBAs who are their bosses to cut corners here, chop stuff there, do shit as quickly as possible because \"YOU can be REPLACED, you RESOURCE\" so they can make as much money as fast as they can and fuck the clients and customers, the idiots will buy it because of slick advertising.  There are far too many middle men in every corporation these days who are tasked with turning out a profitable product as fast as possible and they simply don't give a shit as long as they make their milestones.  I remember when I worked for \"I Be Mislead\", we had a group of people from that megacorp who were tasked with installing a product sorta named like \"Typical Pisspoor Crap\" (-sneeze- Total Productivity Center -sneeze) and they were installing it and connecting it to unsupported systems which can be dangerous if you're doing crap like that - the management software can make data disappear, entire storage arrays at a time when it's not supported.  When I told the team manager (an MBA, no clue about how anything in IT works) that they were doing unsupported systems and it could cause massive problems he said \"I don't care.  My task is to get this up on all these systems, regardless - and by the time anyone figures out that it's wrong, I'll be off on a different project so I don't care.  I'll have my bonus and I'll be off it.\"  As I worked for \"I Be Mislead\" at the time, I wasn't allowed to say anything to the client (as much as I wanted to - firing offense though and I needed the stupid job), but in the years since working for other MegaCorps I've found this over and over and over.  \n\nThe problem are the assholes in the middle.  Sometimes you actually have pretty decent people on the top who want to do something right.  Sometimes you have guys on the bottom of the stack pouring their hearts out into a product or just simply doing the best they can.  But it's the jackasses in the middle that are wrecking things.  I really wish corporations would listen to the guys on the bottom for once.  They might learn a thing or two.",

The company agrees to pay X for damages and the lawyers get a cut and the thousands of people get the rest split.  So if successful the lawyers get decently paid, the people get a check for a few dollars, and the company pays a few million in damages even though they probably still made profit with the damages paid.",

Just removing the possibility to refund shit which is in the contract when you order it in the first place or rather is the law in online purchases is illegal, isn't it?

Why is everyone actually surprised it isnt good ? If you've already bought the game then its to late EA got what they wanted. Just a few weeks ago i was in a thread on a youtube video, i was the only one saying they are going to wait a week to see how good the game is before buying it for the above reasons. Then there were over a dozen people in the thread saying the games going to be amazing and EA obviously learnt their lesson because of that trailer which showed all the things they were adding that wasnt in battlefront 1.\n\nPeople are idiots and thats why EA gets away with things like this and will continue to do so. As soon as the trailer for Battlefront 3 comes out everyone will be throwing their money at EA again.\n\n",

A lot of gamers just develop strange and unnatural attachments to the games they play and the people who make them, sort of like those kids who threaten to kill each other when they dis each other's favourite pop idols. That's infantile, and the shill-gamer version of that is juvenile. ",

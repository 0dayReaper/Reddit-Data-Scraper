    "postText": "So I built my PC recently and just reused some fans I had laying around, and had em in the traditional order of front intake, too exhaust, rear exhaust but I'm wondering what's optimal for this setup \n\nI've never had an AIO setup until now, and I had the radiator mounted frontwards up top with the noctua 120mm behind it, but getting hot air blown at me wasn't fun (PC sits on floor next to me) so I recently reversed the directions of the two so it's radiator backwards and the noctua 120mm frontwards\n\nMy question is do I want the 120mm still as an exhaust fan? I had it as an exhaust fan but it was just blowing cold air up at me so I felt like maybe it's less cold air the cpu is getting \n\nSo I flipped the fan recently to intake but i want to make sure my case gets good positive pressure cause the dusting gets pretty bad in my room and I also want to make sure I'm not just creating an trap making things worse\n\nNot the best pic, and I just drew the arrows on my phone but blue for intake and red for exhaust",

That means air is being pushed out all parts of the computer (exhausted out the top, exhausted out the rear, exhausted out all those rear slots on the case below the GPU, etc) -- since air is being forced out, any dust is also being forced out.\n\nHelps keep your case clean... wont be dust-free, but it will be very low dust.\n\nI like Corsair ML series fans -- they are stupidly unnaturally quiet and move good amounts of air lol.",

    "postText": "So, basically, my backspace, 1, 2, 3 (intermittent), n, m, a, o, u, and left shift keys have either been double clicking like crazy when they do decide to work (only about about 1/2 to 2/3 of the time). I've tried r/LogitechG (useless), logitech support is literally only a chatbot that takes literal hours to get you to a human. It's driving me insane and I'm kinda desperate for any help with this. \n\nHaving Logitech G Hub kinda helps, but I'm wondering if it's a placebo effect. The brokenedness sometimes is really bad and is sometimes really good. I have MX Cherry Blue switches.   \n\n\nThe keyboard's only 2.5 years old, and I should be able to claim for a replacement under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (I live in the UK), but I can't get into any proper contact with Logitech. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated, I've cleaned out the keyboard with a duster and have tried updating firmware where possible, but it seems to be a hardware issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, any help would be sorely appreciated, I'm kinda at my wit's end with this keyboard. My parents would be really pissed off if I had to get a new one because I chose this one as a christmas present a couple of years ago, and specifically chose Logitech because it was a well-known company. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the kinda rant, I'm just a bit hacked off about the problems I've been having.",

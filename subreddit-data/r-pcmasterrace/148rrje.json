If you can manage to make it to the desktop try this:\n\nGo to Guru3D and download their Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU). Run the application and click through the options to completely uninstall your graphics driver, (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, which ever one applies). Restart your computer. Now, when your computer turns back on your resolution will probably be wrong, but that's okay. Go to the website for your GPU's manufacturer and download the drivers for your GPU again. Install the driver. Restart your computer. Hopefully that fixes your weird graphical problems.\n\nIf reseating, replugging, and possibly updating drivers doesn't solve it, looks like a dead GPU to me.",

In my experience, when there are artifacts like that during boot, its likely the video card failing.\n\nDo you have a spare one to test with? Enter the bios and see what CPU it is and see if it has an iGPU. If it does, take out the 1070 and try using the onboard and see if the problem goes away",

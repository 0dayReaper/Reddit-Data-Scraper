    "postText": "Hi everyone ,\n\nSo this September I\u2019ll be starting my 5th and final year of university studying a Masters in Data Science.\n\nGenerally speaking I hear that Nvidia cards perform far better than AMD cards for this\n\nMy main PC has a 7600X with a 7900XT and my laptop has a i5-11400H with a 3050\n\nI\u2019ll probably be able to just use my universities machines for the majority of my work but if I can\u2019t which of my devices would provide the better experience\n\nThanks",

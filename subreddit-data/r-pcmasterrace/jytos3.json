Had to follow a few twitter bots and discord bots that would let you know when there was a drop at any website and then be really lucky to be able to get it as they would sell out in seconds.  \nPro tip: PayPal and Apple Pay is the way to go as those are the fastest way to pay to make sure you get one before they sell out in seconds, also I have noticed that Newegg has drops every weekday at 6:00PM CST.",

    "postText": "Hello everyone. I have a new PC arriving soon and I was wondering if there is anything I should do when setting it up to make it perform better/avoid damage and that kind of thing. I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to tech/pc specs so I thought I would post here to ease my worries a bit lmao. \n\nI will be playing at 1440p @170Hz if that makes a difference or effects anything.\n\nSpecs are:\n\n&gt;Asus TUF Gaming 750W 80 Plus Gold Power Supply \n\n&gt;LL Lian Li LANCOOL 215 Mid-Tower \n\n&gt;CPU- Ryzen 9 7900X \n\n&gt;GPU- Gainward RTX 4070Ti Phoenix 12GB \n\n&gt;RAM - 32GB\n\n&gt;Lian-Li GALAHAD AIO 240mm\n\n&gt;Motherboard - Asus TUF Gaming B650-Plus WIFI (Socket AM5) \n\nI was mainly concerned about the CPU and temps. As I understand the 7000 series is designed to run hot and I was told by the company I bought the PC from (Overclockers) that the Lian-Li GALAHAD AIO 240mm would be enough to keep it cool and at a safe temperature. However I have also heard people mentioning things like eco mode. Would it be advisable for me to put the CPU on eco mode? I just dont want the PC to be pushed to hard and not work or end up breaking after a few months/year \n\nI read the Asus boards can have issues with the 7000's CPU's so I guess my best bet would be to make sure the bios is updated to the current level?",

            "comment": "Updating the BIOS in this case is probably a good idea. The issues you are referring to in your last paragraph is related to overclocking the 7900X3D on Asus motherboards. With a 7900X you should be fine but updating the BIOS ensures that you will be safe. \n\nIf you are not planning on overclocking the only setting I would suggest changing is enabling DOCP. Its is a better memory profile. It will improve performance without impacting stability, unless you have cheap RAM.\n\nYour 240 AIO will provide more than adequate cooling at stock clocks. Most likely no need for ECO mode or anything of the sort. There is a great LTT video relating to *over cooling*. You should check it out!\n\nGood luck and enjoy your new build!",

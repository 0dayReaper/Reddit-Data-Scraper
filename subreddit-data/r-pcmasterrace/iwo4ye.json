From experience I can tell you that your mileage is going to vary on how much you get out of a complicated claim given the experience and quality of adjuster you\u2019re dealing with. Also, the easier you make our lives and follow instructions the more you are going to get out of your claim in the long run. \n\nI think it\u2019s a common misconception that we are out to find a way to deny every claim we get. Truth is, we hate denying claims when people are suffering, however we are just as much bound to the contract as you are and if the policy doesn\u2019t allow payment we simply can\u2019t do it. Denying claims to people that don\u2019t have proper coverage for their loss is the absolute worst part of the job.",

My insurance company gave me a TON of grief when I filed a renter's insurance claim for a stolen bicycle and I was frankly shocked because I thought they were good. Did the whole, \"Yes, it cost you $700 but we found it for $500 at this place that's a couple of hundred miles away from you so that's what we'll give you. No, we won't cover the cost of shipping\" bit, and required proof I had purchased every add-on (lock, saddlebags, rack, etc.) and then undercut the prices there for the lowest priced version of the component. It was the last thing I needed after getting ripped off and when I find another company I'd like to avoid more of the same.",

You cannot outrun a wildfire on foot and you'll be choking and blind long before the fires reach you. All that combined with unless you're watching a real time fire map when you get the evac warning you don't actually know for certain how much time you have, the extra minute to grab something non-essential doesn't seem like a lot but you have no way to know if that's the difference between you dying and living.",

            "comment": "I just read about this one comment from u/0102030405. I imagine it would help a good deal OP. Best of luck.\n\nHey OP... I used to be the guy who worked for insurance companies, and determined the value of every little thing in your house. The guy who would go head-to-head with those fire-truck-chasing professional loss adjusters. I may be able to help you not get screwed when filing your claim.\n\nOur goal was to use the information you provided, and give the lowest damn value we can possibly justify for your item.\n\nFor instance, if all you say was \"toaster\" -- we would come up with a cheap-as-fuck $4.88 toaster from Walmart, meant to toast one side of one piece of bread at a time. And we would do that for every thing you have ever owned. We had private master lists of the most commonly used descriptions, and what the cheapest viable replacements were. We also had wholesale pricing on almost everything out there, so really scored cheap prices to quote. To further that example:\n\n* If you said \"toaster - $25\" , we would have to be within -20% of that... so, we would find something that's pretty much dead-on $20.01.\n* If you said \"toaster- $200\" , we'd kick it back and say NEED MORE INFO, because that's a ridiculous price for a toaster (with no other information given.)\n* If you said \"toaster, from Walmart\" , you're getting that $4.88 one.\n* If you said \"toaster, from Macys\" , you'd be more likely to get a $25-35 one.\n* If you said \"toaster\", and all your other kitchen appliances were Jenn Air / Kitchenaid / etc., you would probably get a matching one.\n* If you said \"Proctor Silex 42888 2-Slice Toaster from Wamart, $9\", you just got yourself $9.\n* If you said \"High-end Toaster, Stainless Steel, Blue glowing power button\" ... you might get $35-50 instead. We *had* to match all features that were listed.\n\nI'm not telling you to lie on your claim. Not at all. That would be illegal, and could cause much bigger issues (i.e., invalidating the entire claim). But on the flip side, it's not always advantageous to tell the whole truth every time. Pay attention to those last two examples.\n\nI remember one specific customer... he had some old, piece of shit projector (from mid-late 90s) that could stream a equally piece of shit consumer camcorder. Worth like $5 at a scrap yard. It had some oddball fucking resolution it could record at, though -- and the guy *strongly insisted* that we replace with \"Like Kind And Quality\" (trigger words). Ended up being a $65k replacement, because the only camera on the market happened to be a high-end professional video camera (as in, for shooting actual movies). $65-goddam-thousand-dollars because he knew that loophole, and researched his shit.\n\nRemember to *list fucking every* \\-- even the most mundane fucking bullshit you can think of. For example, if I was writing up the shower in my bathroom:\n\n* Designer Shower Curtain - $35\n* Matching Shower Curtain Liner for Designer Shower Curtain - $15\n* Shower Curtain Rings x20 - $15\n* Stainless Steel Soap Dispenser for Shower - $35\n* Natural Sponge Loofah - from Whole Foods - $15\n* Natural Sponge Loofah for Back - from Whole Foods - $19\n* Holder for Loofahs - $20\n* Bars of soap - from Lush - $12 each (qty: 4)\n* Bath bomb - from Lush - $12\n* High end shampoo - from salon - $40\n* High end conditioner - from salon - $40\n* Refining pore mask - from salon - $55\n\nI could probably keep thinking, and bring it up to about $400 for the contents of my shower. Nothing there is \"unreasonable\" , nothing there is clearly out of place, nothing seems obviously fake. The prices are a little on the high-end, but the reality is, some people have expensive shit -- it won't actually get questioned. No claims adjuster is going to bother nitpicking over the cost of fucking Lush bath bombs, when there is a 20,000 item file to go through. The adjuster has other shit to do, too.\n\nMost people writing claims for a total loss wouldn't even bother with the shower (*it's just some used soap and sponges..*) -- and those people would be losing out on $400.\n\nSome things require documentation &amp; ages. If you say \"tv - $2,000\" -- you're getting a 32\" LCD, unless you can provide it was from the last year or two w/ receipts. Hopefully you have a good paper trail from credit/debit card expenditure / product registrations / etc.\n\nIf you're missing paper trails for things that were legitimately expensive -- go through every photo you can find that was taken in your house. Any parties you may have thrown, and guests put pics up on Facebook. Maybe an Imgur photo of your cat, hiding under a coffee table you *think* you purchased from Restoration Hardware. Like... seriously... come up with any evidence you possibly can, for anything that could possibly be deemed expensive.\n\nThe fire-truck chasing loss adjusters are evil sons of bitches, but, they actually do provide some value. You will definitely get more money, even if they take a cut. But all they're really doing, is just nitpicking the ever-living-shit out of everything you possibly owned, and writing them all up \"creatively\" for the insurance company to process.\n\nSometimes people would come back to us with \"updated\\* claims. They tried it on their own, and listed stuff like \"toaster\", \"microwave\", \"tv\" .. and weren't happy with what they got back. So they hired a fire-truck chaser, and re-submitted with \"more information.\" I have absolutely seen claims go from under $7k calculated, to over $100k calculated. (It's amazing what can happen when people suddenly \"remember\" their entire wardrobe came from Nordstrom.)",

I wasn't sure where to even start on responding to comments and DMs, so I'm just going to post here.\n\nWhen we received the evacuation notice, the last thing on my mind was taking the PC. I just wanted to get my mom and cat in the car and go. The roads were horrifically backed up and with the column of smoke rising less than a mile away I didn't really want to waste any time. Yes, the computer would've also been very heavy and hard to move quickly. We had renter's insurance, but it didn't cover everything.\n\nThank you so so much for the kind words and offers of support. If you want to make a donation, I would suggest sending your money to the [Oregon Wildfire Relief and Recovery Fund here.](https://oregoncf.org/oregon-wildfire-relief-recovery/)\n\nYou're all very kind, and I hope any of you affected by the natural disasters plaguing the country are staying safe.",

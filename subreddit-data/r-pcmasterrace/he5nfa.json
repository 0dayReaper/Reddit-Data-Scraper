It's possible to unknowingly align your monitor with a magnetic resonance point in your room.  This of course assumes there's an extraterrestrial anal probe somewhere nearby, which there obviously is. Aliens are raping you, dude.  It's not sexual, but it's not consensual.

Came in, and it was somewhere between an S and an M. Contacted amazon who told me to contact the seller who had me ship it to Shenzhen on my own expense (cost me about \u00a325). I was shocked it actually arrived and the refund got processed, but it took almost 2 months.\n\n~~Amazon doesn't tell you who you're buying from~~ **Amazon shows you the seller, but it is in a very small font and off to the side, making it very easy to miss**. Most times you're safe because Amazon is the cheapest seller and is given priority on the rankings. However, if you sort by Price: Low to High, you can run into things like this: https://i.imgur.com/janjpfF.png\n\nAmazon's own listing here was undercut by 10 pence. Even though there is an added \u00a35.10 shipping, the listing will show up first when searching by cheapest price.\n\nThat's why I **ALWAYS** tick the \"Prime\" and \"Free shipping by Amazon\" boxes to filter listings. This guarantees amazon is the seller OR the order is fulfilled by amazon.\n\nEDIT: [Fact checked by u/limpymcforskin](https://old.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/he5nfa/amazon_sent_me_a_block_of_wood_instead_of_my_16gb/fvqdlsw/)",

They are only eligible to do this if they have a good record though, so usually they will follow amazon policies anyway. Amazon logistics pick these up so I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s shown as amazon is shipping it. \n\nI oversea an e-commerce account and we ship things to amazon for prime, but if we can\u2019t ship stock in soon enough we fulfil prime from our own warehouse.",

Sent it back for a refund but they scan the item before packing it, and they had scanned a 2080 which can only mean it got swapped either accidentally or on purpose during the packaging phase as there was no apparent tampering when I received it. \n\nAfter a whole month of dealing with them and being put on hold constantly I had some irate Australian guy tell me that I didnt go through the correct procedure and it was my own fault. Can't get the chat logs from them either so my card company won't do a chargeback as there's not enough evidence. Wouldn't have actually bothered me if it was something like \u00a330 but \u00a3600 is half a month's wages for me personally so took a while to save",

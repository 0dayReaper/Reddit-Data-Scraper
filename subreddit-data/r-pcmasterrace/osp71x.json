You can futureproof for a few years without being foolish by buying last year's best or buy buying slightly more than you were going to.\n\nUnder normal circumstances and pricing, there's no reason to get a (for example) GTX 1050 when you could get a 1060 or 1650 for 10% more.\n\nFeatures that come out next year will take years to be leveraged enough to worry about. Even if it (features, architecture, whatever) is a huge jump, your hardware won't be nerfed into a Celeron unless you're in a pissing contest with someone. Even going from SATA to NVMe drives took several years to be worthwhile to change a motherboard.",

They were going on about how gaming chairs were the best chairs for work and gaming, and their particular gaming chairs were the best built then proceeded to link them.\n\nI rolled my eyes as I sat in my Steelcase Leap chair. I also have a Herman Miller Aeron at work. Not that everyone needs a fancy ergo chair, but there are affordable ergos out there and open box deals on Aeron's etc. Gaming chairs aren't terrible, but they wouldn't be my first recommendation.\n\nJust felt it was disingenuous and got the vibe these two were just pushing whatever shit their sponsors want them to push.

They care about used parts, and are often wondering what older parts are still solid or could potentially, legitimately bottleneck their new GPU.  \n\n\nAnd they can keep an old system, upgrade by upgrade, running for a decade.\n\nModest users need more content that helps them squeeze every single dollar and special consideration out of their options.  Hardware Unboxed did a series once on every single 5600xt gpu being tested and compared and I thought it was just awesome.    \n\n\nI know a few smaller channels will sometimes catch the budgets beneath that and exhaust all options, but such testing has to be expensive and time consuming.",

He's great with watercooling and custom builds, but he's clearly out of his depth when it comes to actual hardware.\n\nHere's just a short list of blunders he's made when it comes to hardware reporting:\n\n - Claiming the 6900XT has \"lower IPC\" than a 3090 because it has similar performance at a higher clock speed (which is not how IPC works when they are different architectures with different core counts, ROPs, etc.)\n - Jumping on the POSCAP drama too early without much investigation when it was really just a driver issue with Nvidia drivers pushing frequencies to high\n - **Most Recently** Jumping on the New World drama and excusing EVGA of all wrong doing with little to no testing or investigation for their fried GPU's, placing all the blame on New World, when days later Igor's Lab found the cause to be EVGA's faulty fan controller and called Jay out specifically for casting a wide net to his audience to report general issues to shift blame from EVGA.\n\nGamer Nexus and Hardware Unboxed are definitely way more reputable. I'm not saying Jayztwocents is bad for not being a hardware guru, but he should defer to experts when he clearly is talking out of his expertise instead of misinforming his audience.",

I think his general advice is to buy the best machine that you can afford because, in the long run, it will be cheaper because you won't have to upgrade as often.  \n\nI think a lot of his advice is based on don't skimp on parts.  People go out and put together a $2k computer and put a 6core chip in it because they can't \"afford\" the extra $70 for the 8 core chip....spend the few extra dollars to get a much better, longer-lasting experience.  \n\n\nAs far as the 32GB of RAM goes, I don't think he has said for most games you NEED 32GB, it is a strong suggestion that it will make your experience better.  \n\n\nAs far as the 3070 goes, his general advice isn't that it is a bad card, but rather bad value for what you pay for it when compared to the 3060 and 3080.  He has a similar take on 6 core chips.  4 cores for a budget machine, 8 for a mainstream machine.  6 cores work just fine, his opinion is that 4 and 8 cores are better value comparatively.",

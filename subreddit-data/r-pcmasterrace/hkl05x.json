So I guess some of the issues we see on that picture can be atributed to camera shutter speed.  \n\n\nScan seems to be happening from left to right, as oposed from up to down. So I guess there are 4 900\\*720 4:3 CRT tubes with portrait orentation. That's why the scanning goes left to right, and the darker part of the screen is where the cathode ray was longer ago.",

I knew that in that time frame ultrawide was still a newish concept. It was not very widely adopted in the gaming industry. You would get so many games that would even flat out not work, would do black bars or be forced to run in window mode. I do remember Warcraft (the strategy game not mmo) did support ultrawide and looked glorious back then.\n\nEven in our modern era, ultrawide is still not 100% adopted by all game releases (even some big new AAA releases on occasion, which blows my mind, especially when big devs dont offer proper UW support but some indie dev will). So just imagine how shitty ultrawide adoption was back in early 2000s when it was brand spanking new.",

    "postText": "Hello all! So, I've been pondering about upgrading my ssd:s a while and yesterday as I was riffling my options in web store, I sort of got exited and build a whole new computer. So, would this be 'reasonable' or not/could it be optimized:\n\nNew pc:\r\n\r\nAsus ROG MAXIMUS Z790 HERO + \r\nIntel core i9-13900K CPU\r\n\t- bundle: ~1320\u20ac\n\r\n2x Kingstong Fury BEAST 64gb (2x32gb) 5600MHz DDR5 RAM\r\n\t- 480\u20ac\n\r\nSamsung 4TB 870 EVO, 2.5\" SSD\r\n\t- 238\u20ac\n\r\n2x Samsung 980 PRO m.2 PCIe4.0 SSD 2tb\r\n\t- 325\u20ac\n\r\nAcer Intel Arc A770 Predator BiFrost OC -GPU, 16GB GDDR6\r\n\t- 400\u20ac\n\r\nCorsair 750W RM750e PSU\r\n\t- 140\u20ac\n\r\nLian Li PC-O11 Dynamic - Razer Edition E-ATX case\r\n\t- 173\u20ac\n\r\nAsus ROG Strix LC II 360 ARGB liquid cpu cooler\r\n\t- 260\u20ac\n\r\n2x DeepCool RF120M-5 IN 1, 120mm case fans\r\n\t- 110\u20ac\n\r\nTotal: ~3440\u20ac.\r\n\nI'm quite heavy pc user so that's what I ended up with. I do realise that Intel Arc a770 isn't the most powerful GPU, but I don't really want to give my money to overpriced Nvidia and I want to support Intel, while waiting for Battlemages. I do a lot varying from gaming to graphical stuff to programming. Now that is very expensive pc and I would need to save up for it, but I could sell my previous one with following specs:\n\r\nOld pc:\r\n\r\nAsus ROG-Strix Z370-f GAMING\n\r\nIntel core i5-8600K CPU\n\r\nSamsung 960 EVO 250gb SSD\n\r\nSeagate Barracuda Q5 500gb SSD\n\r\n1Tt HDD WD Blue\n\r\n2Tt HDD Seagate Barracuda\n\r\nKingston FURY HyperX 64gb DDR4 RAM 2400MHz\n\r\nNvidia RTX3060 12gb PHOENIX\n\r\nFractal define r6 case\n\r\nCorsair TX750M PSU\n\r\nThermaltake Frio Silent 120mm CPU cooler\n\r\nCase fans (5)\n\r\nRazer rgb lights here and there.\r\n\r\nMaybe lucky sell at 1300\u20ac? Then there would 'only' be around ~2100\u20ac left to invest to the new one which in my opinion is even sort of reasonable. Or should I just by those Samsung 980 PRO's and suck it up? What do you guys think?\n\nEdit: Structuring",

                    "comment": "Well not technically. As I said, I don't want to give my money to Nvidia as they are overpriced for their performance, atleast 40-series cards. I could consider 3080. I don't know much about AMD but I have heard they are doing same sort of shenanigans what Nvidia are doing with their prices. Intel CPU and GPU build just sounds interesting to me especially considering that Intel should release their Battlemage series next year.\n\nAlso who said a770 is not good? What I read it should deliver about as much power as RTX3070? Ofcourse there are possible driver issues and so forth. I haven't heard about them overheating but thanks for the point, have to look up deeper!\n\nEdit: typo",

The 3080 is actually a worse deal than the 4070. The A770 still can't put out as much performance as a 3070, as seen by [Daniel Owen's video comparing the A770 16GB and 6700 XT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFHlWQu3qSk&amp;themeRefresh=1). It's in the same video that he mentions the Acer model running hot.",

Maybe I'll have to reconsider if I end up deciding to save up for the machine as 4070 is the only one where price/performance come together in 40-series imo.",

They still work great.\n\nEdit: just checked, and they have about 75k hours on them\n\nEdit2: One of the drives has a little more written to it, but it's at about 120TB written. Which according to the datasheet, it should be good for about 300TB. Hopefully I can get another 8 years out of it.",

I have a HP M.SATA that's sold to me by a PC shop. He told me that was a very good drive (this was when I was just getting into PC gaming, about half a decade about or more). Used internally or externally, the performance was extremely lackluster and actually made my 300mbps internet throttle, having to wait for data to finish writing to disk. This does not happen with the MX500 at all.",

They are way overpriced for what they offer - other brands offer longer warranties, often have way higher TBW values for a given drive capacity, and often offer features like OPAL encryption and a DRAM cache - WD has been known to omit both those features on their cheaper SSDs.\n\nIf you can find them at a good price then WD Black SSDs are a far better offering, though again, the competition often offers better featuresets. Samsung, ADATA, and Crucial usually offer better rounded products than WD, which mostly relies on the brand recognition to sell their stuff.",

TLC (triple layer cell) are by far the most common these days, since they strike a good balance between capacity and durability, and is also what I would recommend. So basically just avoid QLC and you should be good.\n\nBut like others have also said, if your motherboard supports it, you might as well get an m.2 NVME drive instead of SATA, since they are significantly faster in terms of theoretical bandwidth at least, how much of a real world difference it makes can vary a lot, but they usually cost about the same, so why not?",

            "comment": "Well if you really care about reliability and durability, then the primary thing to look out for is the cell architecture, that is wether it is SLC, MLC, TLC or QLC - meaning that there is 1, 2, 3 or 4 bits per cell respectively. \n\nThe fewer bits per cell, the faster and more durable the drive will be, but you then also need that many more cells to achieve the same capacity.\n\nSLC (single layer cell) are the best but are extremely rare these days, MLC (multi layer cell) are the second best but are also quite expensive, especially considering their capacity - which leaves us with TLC and QLC. TLC (triple layer cell) are by far the most common these days, since they strike a good balance between capacity and durability, and is also what I would recommend. So basically just avoid QLC and you should be good.\n\nBut like others have also said, if your motherboard supports it, you might as well get an m.2 NVME drive instead of SATA, since they are significantly faster in terms of theoretical bandwidth at least, how much of a real world difference it makes can vary a lot, but they usually cost about the same, so why not?",

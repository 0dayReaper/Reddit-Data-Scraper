    "postText": "Hello everyone. I am going to upgrade my pc in a few months and I've been wondering what GPU should I buy. I'd like the price to be around 400$ so both 3060 ti and 4060 ti caught my attention. However, I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about 4060 ti. Is it really a worse buy than a 3060 ti even though RTX 4060 ti has DLSS 3 and frame generation which would be useful while playing games like Cyberpunk? Or is there a much better GPU in the same price range?",

            "comment": "Both cards have DLSS.  It's a matter of 2nd gen vs 3rd gen, meh.  \n\nFrame generation usually causes hicups and found I need to turn it off, I would not weigh that feature.  \n\n3060ti is often $50 or more cheaper for the same performance.  \n\n4060ti's only benefit is power efficiency, so if you are squeaking around with a 450w-500w power supply, and that factors into budget, then maybe 4060ti.  \n\n3060ti is generally the better buy of the 2 in that price bracket.  Radeon or Intel may have even better options at that price.",

If I compare with Golf for example. My club is still relatively cheap and they charge 300 members fee and 300 greenfee per year. So that's 600 per year.\n\nYou'll pay about \u20ac2 per bucket of balls at the range for training. (1-2 buckets per visit) \n\nBefore or after a round you might want something to eat and or drink.\n\nYou'll be driving 10-20km on way to go to the golf course. \n\nOn top of that you'll probably want apparel and new clubs every now and then. \n\nShit adds up quickly and you're looking at almost a new PC per year in expenses.\n\n___________\n\nFor me, PC is a tangent to my photo hobby, and that's one with really expensive one time purchases. But otherwise it's a cheap hobby.",

No need to ask or discuss.\n\nOfcourse, in slow times we don't have that money. We're both adults.\n\nWe both pool the rest of our income in one account. Whatever we take from that the other partner can discuss. Like say I see a wonderful pair of shoes in second hand circuit that I really have to have but I don't have any money left over in my own account. My husband could point to the 20 pairs I already own. I could say but they really complete my collection and this one has another colored clasp and when the next month money Comes the shoes are gone etcetera. Same thing with a steam sale for him.\n\nThan we do some bargaining and such. Depending on the state of our finances the other one can just buy it, it's an advance for next month pocket money or there happens some sense about needs and wants.\n\nThe 100 euro, we don't have to be sensible about. My husband spends it all within a week. I mostly save it up but I'm buying at the moment some fantasy series (Robin Hobb) from that money. \n\nIt makes life much more easier. He doesnt need to explain to me why he really needs that game or that third microphone. I don't need to explain my wants. And we both curb our spending to equal amount. \n\nThis stems from a time when we started our relationship and my husband was in debt about silly stuff and just really bad with money. No money for groceries for our kids bad with money.\n\nNow he is much better, as above example of our negotiating his gaming pc. Live and learn",

I mean it helps that we're both PC nerds and have our own builds, but still.\n\nI don't like this toxic boomer ball-and-chain marriage crap. You're married, you should love your partner and share everything with them. Otherwise, why did you even get married?",

I can\u2019t imagine not being able to discuss everything, but especially finances, with my partner... and we\u2019re just dating. If you have to hide stuff from the person you chose to spend the rest of your life with, something is wrong. We both built PCs, so I might be a tad biased. But if he ever gets into another expensive hobby that I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019ll support him as long as our bills are paid and we have food on the table, and vice versa. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted because it\u2019s \u201cjust a joke\u201d, but it\u2019s super overdone and the amount of people sharing similar sentiments in the comments concerns me.",

So I went on a link, and it ended up being a scam, it said allow notifications to verify, it took me to a website pretending to give me a virus, and I got a notification saying I have a virus (obviosly cause I allowed notifications) I'm not good at this, am I safe? I also opened 2 other links, scams aswell but I closed them, don't ask. It downloaded nothing, and I scanned my PC with Microsoft defender.",

It's not about the hardware in your rig, but the software in your heart! Your age, nationality, race, gender, sexuality, religion (or lack of), political affiliation, economic status and PC specs are irrelevant. If you love PCs or want to talk about PCs, you can be a part of the community! Everyone is welcome!\r\n\r\n2 - In case you are not a PC gamer because you think doing so is expensive, please know that it is very possible to build a competent gaming PC for a lower price than you might think. GPU prices are sky high right now for a multitude of reasons, but it's still possible to join the PCMR. Please check out http://www.pcmasterrace.org for our builds and don't be afraid to create new posts here asking for tips on how to do it!\r\n\r\n3 - Please consider joining our efforts to get as many PCs worldwide help the folding@home effort, in fighting against Cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's.

It\u2019s like Intel needs to do something different to get the heat out of these processors.  It\u2019s one of the reasons you don\u2019t see much of a difference in performance between a Noctua tower and custom water cooling rig with a 2C delta.  You just can\u2019t get the heat out of the CPU without the CPU hitting 100C!",

Because if you plug into one of those ports everything works perfectly fine\u2026 except your video games.  \n\nTechnically though\u2026 nowadays it shouldn\u2019t even matter.  Way back in the day (over 10 years ago) Intel figured out how to take the video from an AMD/NVidia card and pipe it out the port for the iGPU (cpu  or motherboard graphics).  It was mostly a laptop technology to save battery life by disabling the dGPU.  But on the 2nd gen i series it made its debut on gaming motherboards at an attempt to resolve stuttering, screen tearing, and controller latency.  Used a special software forgot what it\u2019s called.\n\nI think it was on some 3rd gen (Haswell) boards too but then it went away.\n\nBut now it\u2019s standardized and it\u2019s present as an available feature that motherboard vendors could take advantage of. \n\nNo idea if they do or not because I certainly won\u2019t be trying it.\n\nBut for Dell and other companies they should ensure that this tech is up and running properly.",

The stuff he got was often fucked up (and cheap as a result). I remember one time he got an amazing deal on a couple pallets worth of cases, they were a great deal because none of the drilled holes were tapped. I had to tap everything by hand, motherboard stand-off holes, drive holes, case fan holes, everything. Took me about an hour a case, he paid me $8 an hour and we estimated he saved about $25 per case over his normal ones, so he still made out.",

I think in theory, acceleration on would be the best way to play, since you would effectively have access to multiple mouse sensitivities at the same time. It just seems much harder to master the minute differences of how quickly to move your arm, over consistent 1:1 movement.",

Laptops can even send DisplayPort signals through a USB-C port. Many DisplayPort cables also have clips to keep them securely in your monitor, which is both a pro and a con because they can sometimes be tough to get out!\n\nIt\u2019s not just about specs, each cable also has its place. If you have the choice between DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort would be the better option. In other cases, if a monitor only gives you the choice between HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2\u2014like this Pixio display does\u2014HDMI could be the way to go for the HDR support, as long as all your devices support the HDMI version in question.",

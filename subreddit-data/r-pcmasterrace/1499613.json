It's the internet so who knows if was something made up.   Sounds plausible though... there's other games where people have unknowingly queued up with a cheater and got banned from online services with no recourse.",

I opened a ticket and randomly like a month later I got an adjustment and they gave some back. The hack was literal money bags spawning over my character and falling on me so I couldn't get away from it. The game chat was a bunch of kids begging for money like he was gta Jesus or something. It was pretty bizarre. Then he loaded everyone into a flying bus and took us to the top of the mountain and blew us all up. He then spawned a ufo on our corpses and left. Not even the weirdest hacking episode iirc.",

I think it was so they didn't have to \"test\" (it feels like they really don't test a lot of things) really old things with new ones or something? I don't think the reason was more content and updates.\n\nEither way, garbage reasoning to arguably one of the worst things in D2 history (up there with static rolls, double primaries, basically most D2 Y1 changes lmfao).",

They completely gutted the motorcycle section to only bikes that are ridiculously overpriced for what they are. They also removed base vehicles that could be turned into unique custom versions of said vehicle so neither is now available to people who want them. This change has pretty much killed car collecting for lower level players and is aimed at incentivising console players to buy GTA+ as they now get a \u201cnew\u201d dealership that rotates cars as part of E&amp;E which pc doesn\u2019t get for some reason. I really should\u2019ve seen this coming when Rockstar decided to time exclusive release cars during the last update. They even removed the games cover car ffs",

After that I checked Gpu and it seemed pci-e cable connector was faulty, so I replaced it with another cable and didn't have any issue since. But I'm not sure if this will be the same case for you",

No problem, I've played games that raised the room temp by +4\u00baC and no issues (I'm talking about 70-80\u00baC temps). But then, suddenly the screen turns black and this pixels appear, like OP's image. I still hear the game in the background like it froze. After restarting the pc 2 times and changing the displayport (idk if this did something) everything went back to normal. So, is my GPU dying? Because i have no clue.

Is this a newly installed game? Early Access? Recently updated? I played Apex and it took me weeks to figure out that I had to set a hard limit on my Asus ROG program to 60FPS because Apex was telling it to run at like 400FPS. Same thing happened with Battlefront 2 and it was even worse. And then on top of that I\u2019ve played some indie games that simply weren\u2019t optimized and were using way more GPU Usage than they needed to.",

I would highly doubt they put much thought into how it runs, the first day there were tons of mods and it was just a mess. I would open up an application like NZXT Cam (you can put it in overlay mode so you can play the game and watch your stats) and watch your CPU usage, GPU usage, and maybe the temps.\n\nAfter you do that for Hogwarts do the same thing with another game that\u2019s equal or more intensive that you know runs okay on your PC.\n\nIf Hogwarts is using 95-100% of the CPU or GPU and the other game is staying in the healthy 60% range, then Hogwarts needs to be tuned in some way.\n\nSome settings that are frequently problematic for me are anti-aliasing, Anisotropic filtering (it will say something like 2x, 4x, 8x, etc), render distance, and V-Sync. I doubt Hogwarts has an FPS overlay, but open that if it does and see what it says. If it\u2019s something ridiculous like 300-400 then you\u2019ll have to set a hard limit on your GPU.\n\nIf changing the in game settings doesn\u2019t fix the problem, then move onto the FPS hard limit. Not sure what kind of graphics card you have but for me the program is Asus GPU Tweak II. You can go in and adjust fan speed, temperature ranges, etc but you would be looking for an FPS limit. You can either look up your monitor or look at it in Windows settings, and it should tell you your refresh rate, generally 60hz for entry level monitors, 120hz for gaming monitors, and 144hz for high end gaming monitors. Hertz are effectively interchangeable with fps. Just match your FPS limit to your monitor\u2019s refresh rate and run the application that you used to edit the limit while you play the game and it should keep it from exceeding a framerate that isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nI hope all of that helps! I stream on Twitch and trying to figure out why my games were sucking up all my GPU usage live on the internet was quite an experience.",

Running a 3080ti gpu with i9-12900 cpu...and I turn all my games on 4k ultra settings with minimum 60fps...I figure, for the price, it better not melt.\n\nThat's not to say I've abused my hardware or haven't attempted to educate myself. On the contrary, I've spent hundreds of hours on Youtube deep dives, altering my bios and fan speeds, etc etc...I've done my best to baby the hell out of it...\n\nThe other day, for the first time ever, my gf said it was \"loud\". My response was: \"huh...so that's what a loud PC sounds like\"\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I guess I don't really care or notice since I'm wearing good headphones.

The fans started spinning, but there was no picture at all the monitor didn't even came out of sleep mode also I had a buzzer installed so if there would be a problem I would had heard that. Turned out I brought the CPU model without the iGPU, but I use a GPU all the time and even have the old GPU as a backup so that is not a problem.",

So assuming the same levelling of cleanliness in a room the PC on carpet will have less dust and hair, etc, clogging up heatsinks since that dust and hair is trapped in the carpet instead. On hard floors that dust and hair gets blown around the room and eventually gets sucked into the case.\n\nIf your PC is on hard floor I'd suggest vacuuming or cleaning out the filters, etc, more often.",

It does have a pretty good cooling airflow system and it's mostly old parts so they aren't exactly high performance.\n\nCarpet is also quieter than a hard surface.",

It's just all fuzzy and soft so you can rub it more easily on itself or on your socks to create a charge. That said, the charge is between you and that patch of carpet, not the whole carpet. That's important cuz it's why it won't shock your PC unless you put some real effort into making it happen.\n\nI do recommend not putting a PC on carpet for dust and ease of movement reasons, but it's fine really if it's not restricting airflow.",

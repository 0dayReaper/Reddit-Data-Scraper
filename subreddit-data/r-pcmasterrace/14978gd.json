    "postText": "Will mixing VA with IPS panels hurt my eyes? I have a 27inch 144hz Ips monitor and I am looking for an ultrawide one, here in Russia there are almost no IPS ultrawide but a few good VA. Will mixing different panels make my eyes hurt? I code, game (usually survival or RPG), and surf the net. Just trying and returning it to store if I don't like it is not an option because in Russia you can't just return a hi-tech good if you just don't like it. I definetely want to use 2-monitor setup.",

            "comment": "I have 2 relatively good IPS displays and 1 low-budget VA one (the black smearing is very noticeable). They combine just fine and I don't have any problems with it.\n\nBut I imagine it's very different if you combine the screens for a widescreen gaming experience, where the difference in the look of the game between the different monitors might be jarring. But if you have a different application on each monitor, it should be fine.",

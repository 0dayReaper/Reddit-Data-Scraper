    "postText": "I'm looking to buy a Seagate Iron wolf Pro HDD for the fact of it's price point and the amount of storage. I am curious about what the transfer Speeds would be from the HDD to a NVMe (LEVEN JP600) &amp; vise versa. My question is what determines the transfer speed? For instance... If a 20gb file is already on my HDD. It'd be faster transferring it to the NVMe then it would be if it were the other way around correct?",

That's a fraction of the read speeds of an nvme SSD.",

    "postText": "Bought a premade PC around 3-4 years ago, both front and back fans didn't turn on. I fiddled around with it and saw it was a 3 pin thing for both fans but 4 on the motherboard and that the cable couldn't even reach the motherboard socket. I gave up and forgot about it.\n\nUp until 10 minutes ago I didn't know you can just plug it anyway and up until 10 minutes ago I didn't think to cut the zip ties holding everything together so that the cable could reach the socket.\n\nI'm pretty damn dumb normally but this is a new low. No more overheating now though so that's neat.",

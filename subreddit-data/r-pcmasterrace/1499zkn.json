    "postText": "Hey everyone. I bought my laptop through my university and just graduated, and am wanting to wipe all the random softwares they put on it. There's one software in particular (Trend Office MicroScan Agent) that has been preventing my Windows from updating for like 2 years now and I'm over it. I tried going in and deleting/uninstalling it before but it never worked because it's asking me to provide a valid uninstallation password but I don't have it. How do I fully wipe everything they put on it but still retain my files and stuff? Thanks everyone",

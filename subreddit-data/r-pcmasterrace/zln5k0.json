My brother bought a nice Alienware rig a while back, good specs but the case had really poor airflow so it overheated and crashed pretty frequently.\n\nI offered to put it's guts in a new case he bought, and set to work doing so. Found that the motherboard they used was proprietary, so it had no online manual, and could only interface with that specific model of case. Same with the CPU cooler. Had to replace them both.\n\nDell/Alienware apparently have a bit of a notoriety for using proprietary parts, which complicates swapping anything out or replacing bad/faulty/old components.",

Or there will be a really nutty sale where it just doesn't make much sense. For a recent example, Dell and HP were offering a complete machine with a video card that costs less than the same scalped video card by itself. Or back over a decade ago, Dell offered a first gen i7 system and a mid-ranged ATI video card for less than the price of the processor and video card combined. Free extra components if you ever want to harvest the parts later and build something nicer. It'll be stuff like generic OEM RAM, basic bitch motherboard and a decent-but-low-wattage PSU but they'll work. That thing lasted me over 5 years until I couldn't fit a larger video card in.\n\nThose are OK to steer people towards. These parts cost ____ for their low-end equivalents. If you get it for less and you don't want to build anything, go for it.",

I don't know computers well and have zero time to learn, I need something I can just plug in and turn on. I've been too scared to ask this sub for help finding a decent PC because I'm scared of being judged for needing pre-built.\n\nThanks for this post.

I can see it for people like students who life at the school and go home every weekend. Or a divorce kid who is changing from mom to dad and back every week. If you travel alot for work. If you are a student with degree that involves powerfull PCs (like CAD, rendering etc.).",

You used to be able to buy enough parts at Best Buy to build a pc but most of the people that work there are idiots. I used to work for geek squad and let me tell you, the people they used to hire to work on PCs is crazy!!! \n\nAnyway long story long, definitely recommend micro center and having them help build a machine based on what you are using it for!",

It's a pretty good profit margin.",

Build quality is average, cable routing usually \"good enough\", definitely recommend opening the case and reseating every cable, DIMM and GPU before powering up. They all have upsell services for better cables and cable mgmt.\n\n2. Components, this is where you will likely differ from building your own. They all tend to markup the components a bit from what you'd pay retail online or microcenter, they're making some profit here. If you choose the cheapest components, you're often getting an \"in-house\" brand, something they get a great deal on. We were seeing the worst cases of this during the pandemic, where you'd have an entire PC with basic economy motherboard, value/generic memory, case, SSD and fans, and then a $1400 additional price for an RTX3080, usually whatever they can get their hands on. Under normal conditions, their budget GPU brands used to more closely match MSRP of reference cards, for example if 2070 FE was $500 MSRP, they'd usually have a zotac available for maybe $530.\n\nIf you select the same quality name brand components as you would if you built it yourself, expect to pay roughly 15% more for the finished product (excluding GPU availability issues).\n\nOne thing to also be careful of is their cooling up-sells, I've seen them put a 6yr old 120mm AIO on an 12900K while charging $199 for their \"high performance water cooling option\". Just have to pay attention to fine print. I'd also never trust one to build me a custom loop water cooled rig, but that seems like common sense.",

AT highly inflated price. These ripoff deals are so common over here. That seller will check how much this guy knows about PCs - by throwing some common terms like what do you want i3 ? I5? I7? (Testing if customer knows anything about CPU generations).\nWe have people buying GT710s..

Data recovery (basic) is a service I do for a flat \u00a3100 plus cost of media unless the customer provides their own media (USB external drive, DVD-R, etc). If the only problem is that the boot sector is fucked, that's a basic recovery and I'll even offer the user to rebuild the boot sector for only \u00a320 on top of the backup.  \n\n\nEDIT: For anyone curious as to how I do it, my bench PC has a SATA hotswap tray in one of the 5 1/4 drive bays that supports a single 2.5\" and a single 3.5\" drive at the same time with discrete SATA connections to the motherboard. For NVME drives, I use an NVME external drive enclosure that connects to my bench PC via USB-C.",

I upgraded the RAM and then the graphics card and PSU after a few years and it was still pretty decent.\n\nI moved to university and switched to a gaming laptop (for portability - I know they aren't ideal) and my younger brother took over the PC. He gave it a second graphics update and then eventually it was time to replace the CPU. I couldn't find one compatible with the OEM motherboard (and honestly it was so old at that point - we're talking 7 or 8 years) so I found a CPU/MB bundle he could buy that came pre-built with a cooler, no need to mess around with thermal paste (he wasn't very experienced with electronics so this was easiest).\n\nEventually he upgraded the graphics for a 3rd time, and (with my help) also installed a ln SSD. By this point the original case was jam-packed and I was sure it would be affecting the cooling, so we also switched everything to a bigger case.\n\nAll in all the only issues caused by the PC being an OEM product were needing to replace both CPU and MB at the same time (which was more to do with the age of the PC) and some finicky wiring with the power buttons and LEDs on the original case, which were solved with some jumper wires.",

With a pre built today you would not be able to upgrade gpu without changing power supply and case, then the motherboard would not work with the new case so you would have to replace that as well and then the cpu might not work with the new motherboard so that is another replacement. In the end you are probably better just getting a new pc if you initially bought an OEM pc.",

I bought a pre-built from them around a year ago when the graphics card market was still insane, and I regret it. Motherboard crapped out within 6 months, and going through their warranty/replacement process was a nightmare, at least 6 hours total on the phone, and it left me without a PC for almost 2 months. Originally said that they would send someone to install a replacement at my place, but then made me ship the whole PC to their repair center. Refused to let me install it myself. When I finally did get it back, they had wiped all of my data from all 4 drives that I had installed, though I guess that's on me for not having it backed up. Anyway, when I got it back it booted up fine exactly one time, and every time after it would boot into the BIOS with errors, but I could still get it to boot windows, and it eventually died completely again within two months. I didn't want to go through their bullshit again, so I ended up just buying new components and rebuilding the PC completely. Only things I kept were the CPU, Graphics card, and SSD from the pre-built. Everything runs/feels so much better now, I'm not constantly stressed about whether or not my computer is gonna work. Fuck Lenovo's parts, and ***fuck*** their customer service.",

Got told to DIY even though I literally couldn't. Was a terrible experience.\n\nEventually someone responded with a \"look, just send me three devices and I'll tell you the best one\". I did and... it was the best advice I ever got for PCs and actually opened up the door to fixing it and later building my own. The devices weren't particularly good, but even just knowing the best one (the one I ended up buying only needed it's RAM expanded and a GPU installed, something which was included in the advice) meant I had a decent gaming PC (Mobo and CPU were both pretty good). The only reason I replaced it was because well, 6 years later I was an adult and the Mobo was having power issues.\n\nLike, it's easy if you're an adult who can control their own bank account. Kids often have to deal with weird/unreasonable demands from parents before they can buy things. (To give you an idea for how bad this could get: when I was able to convince my dad to expand the RAM, he suddenly found a \"cheaper solution\" than the one I had researched before to be compatible with my motherboard and it turned out to be incompatible. And then it was my fault for being \"irresponsible with money\". Things don't often make sense.)\n\nEven just knowing the best choice from a list of shitty options can help someone a lot. Think of it less like recommending someone the best parts out of the box but more like giving them a device that while not very good right now, it can always be expanded later.",

This year alone they (or I, in one case) have replaced power supplies that were fried, generally in a year or less.\n\nOne this year was having random crashes that turned out to be due to the *keyboard* that came with the PC. The manufacturer had wired the reset key to a custom fan hub, and required you to hit shift+reset to reset. Which didn't actually work. When the cheap keyboard inevitably had issues, they caused it to hard-shutdown the PC (and then, about fifty percent of the time, hang and require the PSU switch to be flipped to recover, because the power and reset buttons *didn't work*) whenever you typed faster than about two words per minute. \n\nThe owner never figured it out because he gamed with a control pad and never typed anything but his windows PIN, because the machine was purely for gaming. This machine cost far more than *good* components for that build would have cost, and the manufacturer could t even be bothered to switch on the XMP profile.\n\nI steer people away from pre-built PCs because pre-builts so often lead to disappointment, and even lead to people deciding to just give up on PCs entirely.\n\nUnless you're paying a premium to buy from a company that lets you select every component, they're going to cheap out everywhere they think they can get away with it. Even brands you've never heard of building \"high end\" gaming rigs do this. They're all geared toward people who don't know and don't want to know what the components of a PC are or what constitutes good\u2014or even reputable \u2014components. Generally they won't even give you model numbers or names for things like RAM and PSUs.\n\nWhen I recommend people don't buy them, it isn't for some stupid \"status\" snobbery. I'm not looking down on them. I'm trying to ensure that they have the best experience possible with their PC for the least possible investment.\n\nYet people commenting here are saying they're afraid to ask for advice regarding pre-builts. Why? I'm happy to comment on the occasional good deal, or recommend minimum components. Is it painful if I also say, \"you might want to spend fifty bucks on a solid PSU\"? Does warning people to check connectors, RAM seating or BIOS settings for things like XMP constitute shaming, somehow? It's honest advice.\n\nI can't tell them, \"buy this particular pre-built and you'll be set,\" because I don't know of any that I'm confident would meet those expectations.\n\nMaybe PCMR should start cataloguing pre-built PC builds and builders. Having a reference that says things like, \"Skytech gaming uses bad PSUs and doesn't set XMP, also throw the keyboard away\" would be a handy way to help people out.",

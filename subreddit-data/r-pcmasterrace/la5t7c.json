It looks to have pretty shabby animations and there is no gameplay what so ever in the teaser. I would love a game like this, but this looks hardly like it's in alpha, let alone ready to be released in the next couple of months. Aiming for an early '21 release is super unrealistic, bordering to misleading.",

Shelter 3 is in development too where you play as an Elephant.\n\nAnyway, gorgeous game (imo), fun, beautiful music, and makes me cry (happily and sadly). I should really download Shelter...",

            "comment": "Five years ago, my friends and I decided to make an adventure game for PC where you play as a small sugar glider. Every time we showed our game to new people, their first question was always: what other animals can you play?\n\nWell, we didn't have a good answer to that question, so we decided to add some more animals to the game! Their mechanics aren't as polished as the sugar glider, but we thought it would still be fun to play as other creatures in some of the game's side-quests.\n\nLet us know what you think!\n\nP.S. The game is called AWAY: The Survival Series and you can wishlist it on Steam here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/750200/AWAY\\_The\\_Survival\\_Series/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/750200/AWAY_The_Survival_Series/)",

The camera doesn't really help to mask this issue and almost seems to draw attention to it. \n\nThe models look uncannily like animatronic stuffed versions of their actual counterparts. \n\nThe environments don't look natural, with inconsistent details and object placement. Some areas look appropriately dense and natural, others (Like with the mantis &amp; clovers) look highly artificial. \n\nThe only thing I can see in this is traversal and some semblance of survival mechanics? Is that really a good fit for a story based adventure game? \n\nI'm reminded of the Humankind game, except that used survival mechanics quite sparingly and removed focus on them over time as your goals change as the species progresses. It also was about pushing boundaries, exploring, and avoiding then overcoming huge dangers through generations. Any story was very sparse, abstract, and system driven and combat was almost deliberately bare and ruthless. It also just looked a hell of a lot better. That game only had modest commercial success yet was from experienced developers. It was more of an experiment. This sounds, by your descriptions and what I'm seeing, derivative of some popular concepts and put together using bought assets. \n\nI'm being really harsh, but that's what I'm thinking of. This looks like a slapping together of assets with a pitch to its systems that sounds almost remarkably uninspired. How do you expect a story about animals to emotionally resonate? Is a combat system appropriate for such a small team with a diverse set of animals appropriate, skill trees too? How does that service your main pitch?\n\nI don't know what people are seeing in this.",

Kind of answering the question: \"If people could fly but it took as much effort as running, would people actually fly around?\" Would be cool to unlock different birds based on distance and speed goals that are realtively accurate to the birds you unlock. Like, ultra runners can unlock the Arctic Tern and sprinters can get the Peregrine Falcon. Unfortunately I don't have the time or knowledge to make this a reality right now. Would love to play it though so if any developers are reading this go ahead and take the idea.",

The drivers would let you set them at specific resolutions and refresh rates, but you could also find tools to override that and try and push them harder, say 1080p at 85hz or 1440p at 75hz. I remember having one that dealt with being forced past its rated resolutions and refresh rates pretty well, but if you pushed them too hard you got scary noises and melting plastic smell and eventually screen death, because CRTs are badass high voltage giant capacitor analogue machines.  Feels like we took a step back for like a decade when it came to monitors in relation to playing games / in general, when everyone moved to LCD/TFT/OLED/etc",

So far I'm running 1024x768 at 120Hz and it's great. 1280x1024 can reach 90Hz as well.  Just set up a custom resolution and refresh rate with in graphics driver's software.\n\nBecause of the way the CRTs display, aliasing is way less of an issue and you can play modern games on them cranked all the way up since you don't have to run them at such a high resolution and they still look great.

It's only really noticable in games tho, and just having the desktop showing on the 60hz or just turning it off eliminates the problem. This isn't guaranteed to happen to everyone, but it's not uncommon.

Instead of showing the 1080p signal on the actual 1080 lines of pixels, it'll scale up the image so some of it gets cut off on the edges. You have to turn on a setting (\"Just Scan\" on LG) to get a normal 1:1 image.\n\nTVs used to do this back in the CRT days, because the bezel shape meant that showing the full rectangular image would leave gaps, so programs would be recorded assuming that the edges would be cut off, and TVs usually cut some amount off.\n\nIn modern times, this makes no sense. TVs are straight rectangular and none of the image area overlaps the bezel. Broadcasters assume you'll (probably) be seeing the whole image. Having overscan doesn't actually help anything.",

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.",

My local dealer quoted me 1100 dollars for a chair that HM sold directly for 1900 dollars.\n\nThey are not \"overpriced chairs\" by any means.

They're extremely comfortable and ergonomic and so prolific in offices that there is a great used market for them.",

I read a ton of reviews dogging on them for being bad, horribly uncomfortable, etc. I watched a YouTube video where a guy was in the same boat but actually had a friend who was a chiropractor and kind of looked at his spinal placement and other things, and basically said this is pretty correct posture and if you are used to slouching in a normal office chair with bad posture, it\u2019s going to hurt until you get used to it. He stuck it out and after 2-3 weeks he said it was a dream to sit on and even found it more comfortable for working from home since it was more rigid than his mesh replacement. \n\nI stuck through a 2 week period and had similar experiences. Maybe it\u2019s anecdotal but I had back pain from a newborn before this chair and it has eliminated that entirely and i can sit in this thing for 8 hours a day without any pain at all. I even had a reasonably expensive office chair at work that used to give me needle pains after 3-4 hours that was probably $900 for comparison. At the end of the day, chairs aren\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s probably best to try it before you buy it, but with a 2 week \u201cbreak in period\u201d for your back, it\u2019s definitely off putting for some buyers. Don\u2019t listen to the hive mind saying they are junk, 90% of the people spewing this have never sat in one and just circle jerk it because they can\u2019t afford a replacement for their dining room chair",

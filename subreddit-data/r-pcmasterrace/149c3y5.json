    "postText": " \n\n While playing Call of Duty, my PC experiences sudden shutdowns. Curious about what might be causing this, I decided to monitor the temperatures using software like HWMonitor and Ryzen Master.\n\nTo my surprise, I noticed that my CPU temperature reaches a staggering 89 degrees during 10 minutes of gaming. It's worth mentioning that my ambient room temperature is within the normal range, so it's unlikely to be a contributing factor.\n\n**Hardware Specs:**\n\n* Processor: Ryzen 7800X3D\n* Motherboard: MSI B650M-p\n* RAM: \\[16 GB DDR5\\]\n* GPU: \\[RTX 2060\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75itk10ie06b1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9717f248a5c0108916b4027cf41fbc277113bb26\n\n I made sure to update the BIOS of my new motherboard to ensure compatibility and optimal performance with the Ryzen 7800X3D. I followed the instructions provided by MSI and successfully completed the update process.",

No one is actually going to pay this and it makes their business model look bad. I don't know, but recently launched consumer market items (and yes, I would say computer parts, consoles etc are such items because they are intended to be widely available) should have a hard price ceiling in eBay to deter scalpers. That way, most regular folk can actually buy this stuff. So many launches these days suck because shit like this happens. I'm happy I'm not upgrading right now. Will probably wait another year and see whats good in the $500-$700 range from both AMD and NVIDIA, even if I have to buy used.",

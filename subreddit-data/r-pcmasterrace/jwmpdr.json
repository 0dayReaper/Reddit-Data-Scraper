A retailer must be able to deliver to a PO box. You can then track your purchase online.\n\n&gt; * Receive a delivery notice: When your parcel arrives, we\u2019ll let you know by email or through our app.\n\n&gt; * Pick up your parcel: Present your government-issued photo ID at the post office to pick up your purchase.\n\nEdit: formatting",

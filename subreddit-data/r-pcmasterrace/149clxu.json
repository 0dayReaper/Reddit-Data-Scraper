Any ideas what may cause that?\n\nThanks!\n\n\\- I try to change the HDMI cable on another TV input but no change (So probably not the TV).\n\n\\- It often happen few minutes after I wake up my PC. Everyting is perfect for hours then it do it again.\n\n\\- Nvidia drivers up to date\n\n\\- 4090 GamingX / I713700k / MSI PRO Z690-A",

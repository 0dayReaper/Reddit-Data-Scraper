CONGRATS ON REACHING 4 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!\n\nTo enter the contest be sure to comment on this thread to verify you are member of the PCMR and then sign up for the giveaway:\n\n~~SIGN UP FOR THE GIVEAWAY HERE~~\n\nThere's so many more of you here now, so some of you may not know that I'm GloriousGe0rge and I'm here on behalf of CORSAIR! \n\nBut this time I bring amazing friends with us too, from ORIGIN PC, ELGATO, SCUF and LG! Big thank you to all of them for helping us with this giveaway! Be sure to follow all of their channels as they're all giveaway awesome gear like this on a regular basis! \n\nThe full specs of the PC and hardware is in the description on the signup page, and three lucky runner-up winners will receive some gear as well!\n\nIt's always a joy to bring giveaways like this to the subreddit, and I'm so happy to be part of a community that's grown so much.\n\nEdit: there have been some questions we want to clarify. \n\n1.  We aren't providing entries as rewards for actions like following on social media. If you want to keep up to date with PCMR\u2019s partners on social media, the buttons on the giveaway are there to make it easier for you.\n\n2. We want to make sure a member of PCMR wins, so the giveaway has a field for the Reddit name for that purpose. CORSAIR is only using that to verify a winner. If you don\u2019t opt-in to the newsletter, your data will not be used for any advertising or marketing purposes.\n\nEdit 2 - Revised point one to make it more clear and in line with current rules.\n\nEDIT 3 - The contest has ended! Winner has been drawn, notified and has accepted the prize, announcement coming soon!\n\nEDIT 4 - CONGRATS TO /u/shadowcoll for being our GRAND PRIZE WINNER!\n\nAnd big congrats to /u/MrSneakMan_ /u/GlassOfOrange247 and /u/xOverly for being the runner up winners!

That's how most Reddit giveaways are conducted and how it should stay. I don't like the direction this is going.

This already ties your personal information to one very large platform. If people want to get additional entries, their Youtube/Twitch accounts will similarly be connected. Google/Amazon/Reddit profiles now tied directly to your name/country/email address and controlled by Corsair, with a [woefully inadequate section on data privacy](https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/sweepstakesterms) and no clarity on how specifically the data will be used/managed.\n\nThis doesn't concern you?",

It's a huge privacy nightmare. A verified email address along with a name is all that should be required. Ask people to make an account on Corsair, if further information is required. That way, they can isolate that account for only Corsair-specific uses, and not tie any 3rd-party platforms to it if they choose not to.\n\nAgain, I wonder how much of this is intentional...

            "comment": "As conceived in 1632 by Portuguese printing press operator Andre Filipe, boxing was a gentlemen\u2019s game in which two men would square off and regale each other with stories monotonous for days on end until one of them fell to the ground from boredom or exhaustion. Over the next few years, the new sport developed a respectable following of a few hundred local socialites.\n\nIt was Filipe\u2019s son, Andre Filipe Filipe, who developed what he called \u201cthe punching strategy\u201d in 1637 after seeing a schoolboy strike another in anger, causing him to fall down.\n\nWhen Andre Filipe Filipe challenged the then-champion, British ex-patriate \u201cSleepless\u201d Bill Bishop to a match, Bishop was the odds-on favourite. You can imagine his surprise when while he was describing what he had had for breakfast that morning, Andre walked up and thumped him in the neck, sending him down \u201cfor the count\u201d in the parlance of our time.\n\nWhile it was universally agreed that the boy had violated the spirit of the game, officials were unable to find any actual rule that punching violated, and were forced to let the victory stand.\n\nThis upset caused an uproar in the boxing community large enough to spill over into local newspapers, and stirred the interest of many outsiders to come see what the fuss was about. The newcomers were enthralled to engage in these borderline barbaric displays of human strength and skill, and the rest is history \u2013 after a few spoilsport schoolmoms single-minded about safety added the padded gloves, of course.\n\nToday\u2019s boxing enthusiasts fantasise about the newcomer that would rock the ring the way Filipe did.\n\nClassification of the modern ruleset has essentially locked the punching strategy into place; but it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the fantasy. Young scholars with big dreams often enter the ring with their crazy new trick, usually a variant of hypnosis. And though they\u2019ve achieved the occasional victory, none of the gimmicks have been robust enough to make it to the big-time.\n\nThe real wonder, though, is that Andre Filipe\u2019s original vision of boxing is still around. Gentlemen\u2019s boxing clubs can be found in cities all over the world; you can visit one most any day of the week and see two erudite gentlemen exchanging pleasantries in the ring.\n\nMost people only come to watch a few hours of a match, and then leave. But every once in a while you\u2019ll find amongst your elders a stout fellow, a die-hard fan, who perhaps witnessed that historic battle between Filipe and Bishop, who for love of the sport must stay to witness the last glorious seconds of wakefulness slip away, only to return to fight again another day.",

    "postText": "Good afternoon PCMR,\n\nThere is currently a used ASUS ROG Strix RTX 3080 12GB on auction - currently \u00a3410.\n\nThe advert claims that it's only been used for 6 months in a flight sim rig. Is this a good deal?\n\nGiven the length of use it seems fine, but want to exercise caution.",

            "comment": "Yes, there is significant speed and latency loss. Not really noticeable in most games unless they are prone to long load times. I benchmarks you'll probably see a drop from 3000MB/s natively on a gen 3 drive, to around 600MB/s over USB 3.1 gen 1.",

We have similar limitations when we compare sata with nvme. Here, too, the differences in throughput are significant, but still reallife tests consisting of loading applications, do not show big differences. I would like to see similar tests for USB, which is in version 3.2 gen 2. It is twice as fast as SATA.",

I'd like to tell you 2 things:\n\n1 - Everyone is welcome here, provided you're a chill person who doesn't mind occasional tongue in cheek humor.\n\n2 - In case you are not a PC gamer because you think doing so is very expensive, please know that it is very possible to build a competent gaming PC for 500 dollars or less. Please check out http://www.pcmasterrace.org for our builds.\n\nFeel free to use this community to post about **any kind of doubt you might have about becoming a PC gamer or anything you'd like to know about PCs**. That kind of content is not only allowed but welcome here.\n\nHave a great week!",

            "comment": "Okay this post blew up really fast.... but i want to say i am thankful to the P.C.M.R community cause you guys are really supportive. i want to clarify on somethings and quench the curiosity of some. \n\n1.  This PC is built with parts shipped from the US and usually shipping is 1 to 1.5 months so i bought a lot of these parts during black Friday. The other thing is i don't use DHL to ship rather a company called [Bazebo.com](https://Bazebo.com) which has premises in the US and once i place an order with them they take care of the purchasing form the online retailer and shipping it to there warehouse in Uganda where i go to pick them up. So i am able to pay less for shipping as compared to DHL cause these guys ship in bulk weekly from the US to UG.\n\n2. We do have electricity in Uganda in fact my country exports electricity to nations like Rwanda, Burundi and Kenya\n\n3. We do have internet here in fact you can get all the way from 10mbps to 100mbps. it all depends on the ISP and how much you are willing to cash out. And when playing we usually connect to other servers not necessarily African Servers.\n\n4. The specs are Ryzen5 2600/Gigabyte Ds3h MOBO/ Rx580 4g/ 16gb of Ram/ 500w psu/ 500g ssd \n\n5. lastly you all must know that this isn't the first computer in Africa but i probably am the first to post to Reddit while disclosing my location. most of the people that built computer in my country love single player and aren't into online gaming mostly cause it cost a pretty penny to have internet. \n\nalright i guess i am done... thanks for the karma and the coins fellow members of the PCMR. i consider this a worthy Initiation",

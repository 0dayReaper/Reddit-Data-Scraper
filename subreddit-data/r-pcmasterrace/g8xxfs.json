Mind you, it wasn't always the same cable in the same location, I just like to have charging cables everywhere I work, play, study and in every vehicle.\n\nI was buying a 10 pack of 10ft micro USB cables every few months (to share between myself and my wife) until my Note9. I've bought one 10 pack of 10ft USB-C cables in 2 years and still have some left in storage.\n\nMy guess is the fact the USB-C Jack and head are both more rugged and engage/disengage smoothly. You can drop a micro USB cable with a device attached and have the head get damaged by whiplash because it didn't release or the head can get bent by someone having a tough time disengaging it. Hell, I've grabbed the cable and yanked a phone to have the cable head rip the port clean out of a Galaxy S4. It's just a poor flimsy design, IMHO both it's predecessor the mini USB plug and the USB-C standard that followed are far superior.",

It can do multiple things.\n\nType-C is actually the connector designed to carry USB signals. \n\nWhen they designed Type-C, they make it so it could also carry other arbitary signals. This is call Alternative Mode.\n\nThings like Thunderbolt **3** Alt Mode, HDMI Alt Mode, as well as DisplayPort Alt Mode, allows you to transfer those signals over Type-C.\n\nUSB Power Delivery mode (the 100W thing) is just a mode for when you are transfering power and those extra pins are switched from data signals to power signals.\n\nNow, when USB4 comes around, it will almost be the same as having TB 3. (the USB4 standard is based on TB3 standard)",

Like I said for the layman it's totally overcomplicated.\n\nThe USB group aren't very good with naming and marketing though, throwback to USB 3.2 Gen 2x2",

The case addresses many of the biggest issues I found in the ITX market. \n\nI would love any feedback or ideas you guys might have before preorders open some time next week. \n\nThe SUB-20 is manufactured from steel, laser cut and folded to produce an absolute tank of a case. I threw the last prototype into the air when I was done with it and it was fine after impact. \n\nSpecs are listed below!\n\n- Max GPU length \u2013 342mm\n- Max GPU height: 4 Slots\n- Max Cooler height \u2013 175mm\n- Dimensions of core: 198x348x283\n- Volume of core: 19.5L\n- Dimensions including interchangeable side   panels and protrusions: 303x202x352\n- Materials: Steel\n- Motherboard support: ITX, mATX\n- IO: 1x USB Type C 3.2 Gen 2\n- Fan support top: 2x140mm, 2x120mm\n- Fan support front: 2x120mm\n- Fan support rear: 1x120mm\n- Fan support side: 2x120mm, 2x140mm (If PSU tray installed on side mount, only 1x120mm)\n- Fan support bottom: 2x120mm, 2x140mm\n- Radiator support top: 1x240mm\n- Radiator support front: 1x240mm\n- Radiator support bottom: 1x240mm, 1x280mm\n- Radiator support side: 1x240mm\n- PSU Clearance: 160mm (including system cables)\n- Power supply support: SFX/-L, ATX",

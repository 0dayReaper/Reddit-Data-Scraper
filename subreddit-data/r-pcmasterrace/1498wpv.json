    "postText": "\n\nHi, 2 days ago my screens went dark and displayed \"no signal\" text, i had this problem many times before and it always went away after replugging psi power cables to my gpu. \n\nThis time it didnt work though, im currently testing many things with my dad to see where the problem is, my windows doesnt work and bios doesnt show ssd at all so we figured that the problem lays in the ssd. \n\nWe tried many cable configurations and right now my ssd is sometimes visible, sometimes not but my windows still doesnt work, the only difference is that instead of waiting 30secs for bios to open itself i can open it with del or f10. I have no idea what to do. Is there a way to tell if its completely destroyed?",

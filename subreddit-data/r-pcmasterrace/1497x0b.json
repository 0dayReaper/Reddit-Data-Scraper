    "postText": "I\u2019ve been playing Cyberpunk 2077 on an Xbox One X and really want to play the Phantom Liberty DLC but don\u2019t want to waste my money on a new Xbox. I\u2019m interested in building a PC that I can use to play games but also use for streaming in my living room. I\u2019m slightly feeling overwhelmed with figuring out how to start out, and want to know if anyone has recommendations on easy to follow starting out guides to PC building. Even better would be suggestions on which manufacturers are more reliable, and preferences on motherboards, CPUs, GPUs, and RAM (DDR4 vs DDR5). Right now I\u2019m looking for something that is simple, affordable, but can easily be upgraded in the future. From what I can tell I don\u2019t need a sound or video card because everything will be plugged into a TV via HDMI, would prefer an SSD over HDD, and will need an optical drive. \n\nThank you for your help!",

There are dedicated sites like pcpartpicker where you can pick and choose parts and guides to help you decide. It mostly depends on your budget though on what components you choose.",

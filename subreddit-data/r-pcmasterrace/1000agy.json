The worst part is that they did this to all their earlier hit franchises like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed, which started out with relatively good open worlds, albeit a little repetition but the games were good.\n\nThen they kept copy and pasting shit, while quadrupling down on that formula. Going to a new zone doesn't give you a sense of excitement, it gives you a sense of dread as the map is about to be filled with 15 towers to climb, about 30 camps to clear, and 50 useless question marks on the map for stupid shit.\n\nI saw this get worse and worse with the last 3 AC games. Origins had a fuckload of shit on the map, but the game did just transition to an RPG model so it was different and kept it kind of fresh. Odyssey was basically an improved Origins... with a bigger world and more shit on the map, towards the end of the game I couldn't take it anymore and just blitzed through the last 1/4 of the story so I could turn the game off.\n\nValhalla got announced and the devs had the audacity to say they toned down on repetitive content, that the map would have stuff to do but it would be meaningful, yeah that was a fucking joke. Every zone would have anywhere from 20-50 fucking \"treasures\" to find, among other activities - clearing all the zones of all the crap was easily 70 hours out of an 80 hour game. I'm never touching an open world Ubisoft game with any kind of RPG elements again, I may try AC Mirage because it's supposed to be just OG AC type of game.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; Black Flag is up there for me, but mostly for the pirating\n\nI replayed it recently, and at the very least it's one of the more enjoyable early AC games to 100%. Some of the AC2 games and especially AC3 have awful optional objectives that make trying to Full Sync a chore, and that's before even touching on all the required collectables. Black Flag removed optional objectives for a lot of the side quests (or at least made them not count toward sync and just give extra money instead), but even the main quest optional stuff is pretty reasonable. And it makes no sense in-game, but the stealth in Black Flag is SO GOOD compared to how awful it is in AC3 (and I say that as someone who enjoyed AC3).",

I think jets got more flares or better missiles or something. \n\nCall of duty isn\u2019t much better. With a lot of the focus being on warzone, they made the guns an absolute chore that takes hours each to level up in warzone. All so they can sell the game where it\u2019s faster to level up guns. Vanguard having 70 levels per gun was atrocious. 70 attachments per gun where virtually every gun used the same 10 attachments and the other 60 were pure filler.",

(hero landing 2+ enemies took me 5 tries for instance)\n* I had a weapon completely disappear from my upgrade screen (it was not max upgraded, I promise. I was only level 45 at the time.)\n* Only once, I was sitting still in a nothing area after committing no crimes and a couple cops just spawned and started shooting me (art imitates life?)\n* The actual point used for aiming seems to be several pixels above my crosshairs?\n* Two times now, I've summoned my vehicle and seen it spiraling through the air over my head\n* Sticking an item with mods on it into any stash or selling and rebuying can cause the mod to degrade in quality and effectiveness. This might be intentional but I never saw it explained anywhere, but it's super annoying when a cutscene forces your items into a locker and when you pick them up they're all worse.\n* Many, many others.",

Like add every other buggy ass game together and for me it isn't even close. Fallout, skyrim, gta, old AC games, whatever... just not anywhere near that level. It was what it was though, I knew it needed at least another year or two to cook when I went in, it just was worse than expected. I was hoping by the drop of their DLC though it would be fairly polished, especially since afaik they havent spent much time doing any major reworking/improving of the more major systems (cops, combat, stats, etc) or adding content. Hopefully there is another major improvement with the dlc drop.",

Too many of their games are bugriddled messes, if they even work at all (I've been able to play UNO online successfully with minimal issues about 3/10 times. Can't recall *once* where it just worked lol). While less greedily cashgrabby than EA, and less obviously problematic than Act-Bliz, Ubi primarily releases overly safe, boring-ass games that a lot of gamers don't find challenging or even enjoy at all. \n\nThere's probably more things you could mention, and elaborate on, but I mean, different strokes. I often defend Epic Games when people shit on them, because I think they're doing a lot of good stuff as well. And I don't hate everything they do. It's OK if you like something others don't. :)",

Some people love it but it would be hard to find someone that didn't think the game was full of pointless quests, an incredibly long story, repetitive (not very deep combat) combat.\nThere is probably a lot more but the point is that these things have become prevelant in all their games and it looks like it's only gonna get worse.\n\nAlso microtransactions that are anything but micro.",

I'll definitely agree with the microtransactions bit and the worlds getting really big. I have 200 hours in Odyssey and it was great cause I'm a really busy person so the big world but simplistic controls let me be able to pick it back up after months with no problems but I can see how someone wanting a more solid game would be disappointed.",

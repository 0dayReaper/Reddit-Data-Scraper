Either bad GPU drivers (do you have the latest ones?) or GPU has suffered some damage. I would recommend external analysis, checking that there is no physical damage such as burn marks, bloated condensators, lacerations, dust overflow. I would also recommend checking the PCI slot and the motherboard.\n\nWhat temperatures does your GPU run usually at? If you haven't checked and it turns out that those temperatures are high (closer to the 90s) that may cause the problem via: a) the chip is too hot and fails to work correctly (though I have had working gpus at 117-125 celsius, they probably would die like in a hour or two) b) Your GPU's chip is damaged beyond repair and it's time to prepare for the inevitable.",

Chrome will put tabs you don't use to \"sleep\" to don't brick your pc. \nWhen you're running only 8gb, you could fill it up with 100 chrome tabs easily. But even if this happens, Chrome would use your hard drive as a ram substitute to keep going. \nThe error code shown in your picture is often related to driver issues. Update your stuff and try reproducing the bluescreen. If you can't, good. If you can reproduce it, try reinstalling windows. If it keeps happening, you can try to swap every piece of your hardware piece by piece and test again after each piece to find the issue.",

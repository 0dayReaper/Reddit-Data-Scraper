    "postText": "So I live in eastern europe where the prices for pc parts tend to be a bit funky so to speak.\n\nAfter seeing the starfield system requirements I'm starting to think my rx 580's days are numbered and I might need an upgrade. And well the rx 6600 seems to have similar performance to the rtx 3060, at least without ray tracing on. But here the rtx 3060 is about 440 dollars on average while I can easly get an rx6600 for 240 dollars??? (both brand new)\n\nThat's good deal right?? that's almost the same frame rate for half the price. And I already use amd and I'm pretty happy with their drivers and stuff tbh, what do you guys think about this? Is it a good upgrade from an rx580 at this price?",

You won\u2019t get the kind of smooth ray tracing like with the RTX 3060 however that is hardly a drawback if you prefer higher frame rate gameplay over having ray tracing turned on. IMO you cannot go wrong with AMD in 2023!",

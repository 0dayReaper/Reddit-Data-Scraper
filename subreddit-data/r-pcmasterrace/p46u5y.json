In my experience, my inventory was full of weapons and I needed to find some platinum in order to increase it so I could do anything else. People were talking about being able to buy and sell to get platinum, but I couldn't find out where or even if I could yet, so I just uninstalled because I was unwilling to destroy any of my things.\n\nOf course, I also had huge gaps in playing and had no idea where I was or what I was supposed to do. Also I'm an idiot and only wanted to play the game when I was on drugs, so you can pretty safely dismiss all of this as invalid criticism.",

There's a relic station on your ship that shows you what relics you have and what potential rewards you can get from opening it.  The galaxy map shows you what missions you can do to open those relics.  If you do it in public groups it's really fast and you can spam relic missions pretty much all day long (as long as you don't run out of relics!).\n\nYou're limited to how many items a day you can sell based on your mastery (mastery level 5 = 5 trades per day), but once you learn which relic items are worth the most plat, it's ez pz.",

There's whole acres of crappy \"retro-aesthetic\" games out there that suck out loud with their graphical decisions; for every Stardew Valley or Terraria there's a hundred shitty-scaled spritework games that have absolutely awful visuals because they're \"retro\" and not actually good. \n\nIt's like if someone drew a character with crayons, and it was terrible, then they used a filter on a phone to render it down into an 8x10 pixel icon to make it look nicer. Yeah, it doesn't look like bad crayon now, but it's still not very nice to look at. Good sprites are *very* hard to make look good, which was a key component of game design once upon a time. Now it's a choice they make to save time and effort, and that's pretty obvious in most cases.",

It used to be that 60fps was the pinnacle of framerates, but people still accepted playing at 30fps as perfectly normal performance. Now some people are openly hostile when new games don\u2019t get 100+fps on every budget PC. There\u2019s definitely been a shift in tone over the years.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve rarely seen a such an example of the \u201cvocal minority\u201d. Every comment is telling me how wrong I am, yet the upvotes speak clearly that people seem to agree with my take. I\u2019ve been PC gaming since the 90s, never even had a console as a kid, and mostly had 60hz CRTs. Yes, I know they came faster and with higher resolutions, but not everyone had those. I also know I built my own fan mount to overclock a Voodoo 2, and I rubbed my pencil on my Athlon CPU to unlock the multipliers on it. All in the pursuit of better fps, because I was used to playing sub-60. I\u2019m happy so many people had nice 100+hz CRTs and top of the line computers to play competitive games, but neither I nor my friends ever really did that. We played what we could, whether it was Half-Life, Day of the Tentacle, Duke Nukem 3D or Age of Empires. Hell, I didn\u2019t have a proper wheel, so I played Monster Truck Madness with a Microsoft Sidewinder *joystick*. If your experience of PC gaming was better than mine, I\u2019m happy for you, but this is still my experience and the experience of basically everyone I know.",

The new business model is 95% microtransactions and 5% actually improving the game. The old business model was improve the game to attract more people to buy the game.\n\nPUBG was a poster child example of this mentality which eventually lead to its demise. Sadly once game companies realized how much money they can make selling skins and loot boxes improving gameplay became largely irrelevant.",

You cannot have that level of rewarding given to the player for their spending of money on chance. It's *too* effective on the human psyche, literally, we cannot not be effected by it in many cases - which is why it's illegal to have a slot machine that takes credit cards for convenience and never pays out anything but will always make very satisfying winning noises. *We would line up for that fucking machine.*",

Games like Golden Axe, Indiana Jones &amp; the Fate of Atlantis, Maniac Mansion, Stunts, and so on...\n\nBut then I go back to play one again and realise how much has improved in terms of \"quality of life\". It's not only graphics. But games today are objectively better. Sure, things like micro-transactions and \"pay-to-win\" models suck balls. But not all games are like that.\n\nThere are many things you can complain about nowadays, but on the whole I prefer newer games to older games. There are some exceptions though. Like Zelda: A Link to the Past or Super Mario World. Those are just timeless gems.\n\nI'm always surprised that games today are still only around 60 Euros considering how far they've come and how much more goes into production nowadays. I'm not surprised companies are trying to find other income paths (like micro-transactions or early-access). Yes, it absolutely sucks for the end-user and I would prefer those things to disappear quickly. But I'm not suprised those models exist. And I don't hold it against the companies to use such models if people are stupid enough to pay. They are companies and they want to make a profit. If people would stop paying into early-access or micro-transactions they would definitely stop doing it.\n\n/rant\n\nSo in summary: I prefer newer games to older games. With some timeless-gem exceptions and of course nostalgia-exceptions :D",

It was like the jump from stick figures to near photo realism.  I would go as far to say it was much bigger than the jump from 2D to 3D because when 3D first came out it wasn't very good and was extremely low res textures if there were even any textures.\n\nThe jump from midi &amp; synthesized sounds to real samples &amp; voice recordings was always huge.  Before CD's came out all music and sound effects were synthesized because media was not large enough to actually hold a digital recording.  Adventure games really ruled PC gaming and to actually hear the dialog instead of reading it was insane.  Games like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle on CD absolutely blew me away.",

Bband wasn't so widespread, journalism was basically only the PC Gamer magazine on the shelves, YouTube wasn't filled with sellouts positively reviewing everything to keep their channel going by sucking the publishers so they'd keep getting early copies (looking at you YongYea and your Cyberpunk review).\n\nGames weren't spoiled on release day by YouTube shoving the ending in your face because you watched one trailer pre-release.\n\nI hate the culture of gaming today, it's pathetic and just a race to spoil the game as much as possible.  New games don't feel new any more as it feels like they've been shown off so much across varying mediums that it feels like I've already played the game before actually playing it.  Betas, tech demos, YouTubers spamming every clip they find for views and money.\n\nThen there's the copy and paste nature as publishers only want to fund what sold well yesterday, so we have this churn out of Battle Royales and CoD clones and...\n\nUgh.",

They might not be the biggest games with the best graphics, but many of them have fresh new ideas, and you can feel the love to their art of the devs when you play the games.",

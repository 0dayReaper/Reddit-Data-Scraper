Honestly I think you might do well to get a 2080Ti or RTX Titan on eBay for cheap, a 3080 will definitely perform better and be more future-proof though so I guess it depends on your budget and playing habits.",

Hell CSGO wouldn't even get 200 depending on the map. 1080 and I'm at 144+ fps high on most games and 300+ csgo\n\nThis is the first series that the mid tier cards should be able to handle 1440 and I'm excited. I also feel the next year 2060 is going to struggle with games like cyberpunk so at the prices they have for this series it seems like a good time to future proof",

It's not the same browser as IE at all, which is why I find these memes that treat it like it's just the next IE version annoying. I think people get confused since the logo is similar.\n\nHonestly I'm sad they're ditching their own rendering engine for Chromium this time around. Now Gecko is all we have to hold back Google from owning a literal monopoly on browser engines, and that should really scare us. Owning a monopoly on rendering engines is *why* IE got as bad as it got.",

I'm currently using Afterburner's default fan curve and it keeps the fan spinning even on low temperature. Should i change the fan curve so that it'll stop spinning the fan on low temp? thanks all.](https://preview.redd.it/4i1q0gizaz5b1.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1cd97ebee37801402b7b58467bfdc757ce87ba66)",

If you have either of your powerline adapters on the same breaker as a high power DC PSU you will get much lower speeds.\n\nYou can reduce the impact by plugging the PC directly into the pass through outlet on the adapter where it can filter some of it out, or better still by using a UPS with your PC",

Destiny 2 and CS:GO, for example, are 2 titles that have pushed about 10x the bandwidth requirements of WoW, and each, independently, average about 100kbps while playing. \n\nAlternatively, you might have more issues with upload bandwidth than download.\n\nNot to mention all of the other crap that might be tied to your internet, trickling away that connection speed without realizing it. You could have gigabit connections, and still experience bandwidth related latency if you are simultaneously running multiple downloads. \n\nSimply having the bandwidth does not mean it's being dedicated to your game 24/7 either. You'd be surprised at how often 50mbps becomes a bottleneck in a family home.\n\nForgot to address your last point - in my home, the powerline adds 1-2ms on average to the hop between the computer and the router - since communication is 2-way, double that for proper latency. Minimum never drops below 1, maximum is regularly above 20 (meaning there is much instability in that line, but not quite enough to see losses on a 50-packet tests. That's slower than just using WiFi, and significantly slower than ethernet (which averages about .2-.4ms on the same hop, with maximums never breaking 1ms in my tests). Doing a little light research indicates these numbers are pretty normal. What powerline are you using? Are you sure you tested it from a computer that's using it?",

They can communicated between each other at up to 1000Mbps. If you add in an AV600 it can communicate up to 600Mbps, so it will drag down the other AV1000 to its slower speed. The answer is similar to broadband connections where there are multiple frequency bins it can communicate with. The more bins it can access the faster it goes. \n\nI\u2019m on a system with about 5/6 powerline devices. My AV1000 communicates at 200Mbps. The AV600 at the end of the garden communicates at about 50Mbps. So it\u2019s very dependent on the wiring underneath as that\u2019s the bus you\u2019re using.",

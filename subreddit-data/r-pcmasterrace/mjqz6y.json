If you love PCs or want to talk about PCs, you can be a part of the community! Everyone is welcome!\r\n\r\n2 - In case you are not a PC gamer because you think doing so is very expensive, please know that it is very possible to build a competent gaming PC for 500 dollars or less.

Not a single dead pixel, no atypical backlight bleeding (IPS panel), 65 hZ and great ergonomics that lets me flip the monitor even vertically, for just over 400\u20ac. Switching from a Samsung model that doesn't even let me adjust height or angle of the monitor was huge. I very much recommend this model that's looking for a 27\", 1440p, 144 hZ with great ergonomics that wants to use this monitor for gaming and art, to get the best, most accurate colours for an adequate price.",

Consumer/low end Lenovo systems are pretty much on-par with Asus/MSI/Acer/HP consumer crap, but ThinkPads are just progressive refreshes and improvements upon the original IBM ThinkPad line. We're talking industry standards in enterprise computers.\n\nEven as far as consumers are concerned, if you aren't primarily looking for raw gaming performance (in which case a desktop will probably serve you better, unless you specifically need a portable gaming system): ThinkPads, Surface Pro/Book, Dell XPS and MacBooks are as good as it gets.",

And yea, got used to it and keept going for like 3 years like that, also, table wasn't big enough. Than got me the same Asus again. Perfect. Still got the other small ol' timer for my 2. gaming and office rig, since that table's some tiny son of a Bitch!   \nBet that screen will go for another decade, things a tank, and yea, LCD/LED screens, dude.

First I thought it is a problem with my DP cable, changed it.. same thing again. \nWhat I noticed, is that this problem usually goes away within 10-20mins after starting my PC. Also, it depends on whether/what application is opened or not. What the heck can this be?! I am going nuts ",

You can continue to use 144hz if you allow your monitor to run for a while to build up charge before using. If you lower your Hz it requires less power from the capacitors and that can help but I would highly recommend to continue using 144 and just allow your monitor to build some charge before using. Those lines cover my entire screen when I start up but after letting it sit for 10ish minutes its perfectly fine.",

I\u2019d like to think my dad is one but I don\u2019t work for him. He did keep his employees on hand directly out of his retirement savings when shit hit the fan back in 2008. \n\nThe company I work at is also owned by one man and they paid me 3 months full time when my son was admitted to the hospital back in 2017. When I came back back time they paid me another three months full time when I was only working 20 or so hours a week. \n\nNot saying all small businesses are like this, but I like to think there are still more than a couple of fantastic people out there. Shit is way to depressing otherwise",

I quit my job so I could be home for the first month. And how dare you mention hospitals and access to medical care? That's a low blow. You already know it's bad here.\n\nIn the same way we people looked at religion and decided \"that's no for me\", some went further and now we have crazy fundamentalist atheists. We also have the \"child-free\" crowd, who can't wait to tell you of their assumed superiority.\n\nIt's sad.

Her doctor had to fight with the insurance to get the scan approved, just insane! And there were countless other times the insurance tried denying her something that the doctor wanted her to do. \n\nMom is cancer free now in case anyone is curious :-)",

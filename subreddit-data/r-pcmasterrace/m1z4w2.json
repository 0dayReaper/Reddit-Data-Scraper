I was like, fuck yeah this is gonna be so cool.. \n\nI hooked it up and used it like one time, then the next day after school i turned it on and it was just all fuckin fuzzy.. I looked at it, and it looked like someone had jammed a bunch of tape down in to it.\n\nTurns out, while I was away at school.. instead of just unplugging the webcam, my dad decided to take a pencil and jam multiple layers of scotch tape over the lens of my brand new camera. Couldnt just turn it.. ouldnt just unplug it.. Had to leave it plugged in, facing him, same spot, but with tape over the lens...",

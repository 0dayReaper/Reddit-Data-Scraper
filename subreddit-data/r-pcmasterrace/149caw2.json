    "postText": "Just built a new PC, had peers recommend me enable EXPO II due to DDR5 ram and AMD high performance power settings. I was using a few tools such as Armoury Crate, CPU-Z and HWiNFO to check my clock speeds and temps. I am not very knowledgeable yet about what speeds and temps I wanna aim for for longevity of my parts/CPU.\n\nHoping someone can take a look and verify if everything is looking good? These are all speeds with just the tools and some Chrome tabs open, no games. If I need to run any benchmarks let me know. \n\nFrom using the Armoury Crate tool my idle temps are between 30-40 degrees Celsius with it hovering between 50-70 when playing Diablo 4 on high settings. My clock speeds are averaging between 4200-4800 Mhz with occasional split second highs of 5000-5200 Mhz. Are these temps/speeds indicative of any potential issues? Sorry if this is a glaringly dumb question but this is my first build. \n\n[Temp and MHz of CPU](https://preview.redd.it/hx73uhu2f06b1.png?width=2218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f3960f143800b78ac824a01163dc4c5f1681cb5)",

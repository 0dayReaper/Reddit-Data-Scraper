For the latest fixes and functionality, we recommend that you opt in to the Steam client beta.*\n\n*We've added the Valve Complete Pack to your Steam account as a gift from Valve.  This will give you all of Valve's games (past, present and future) free of charge.\"*\n\nSo I received HL: Alyx on release, but I don't have a VR headset to play it...\n\nEdit: I forgot I also received Artifact, which I never installed either.

Before, I would buy cheap games that I knew I would play eventually, but because of the potential \"rewards\" you received for spending money. Now, I only buy a game if I want to play it. Obviously that is better from a personal financial stand point, but I spend less money on Steam now. \n\nThat's your fault, Valve!",

Valve changed it with the painful library rework so that if you installed it once, you'll always see it there.\n\nAs velocity37 explains below, if you \"own\" a game and it's not tagged as potential shovelware or such, it'll increment your profile game count by +1, even if it's free. So buying games before they're free is useful both to increase game count and to make sure it's visible in the library even if you never installed it.\n\n(Games that you don't see in the library but have a license for can still be installed via commands, it's not a big hassle.)",

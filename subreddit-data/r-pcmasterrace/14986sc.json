    "postText": "Hey, I desperately need a new PC as my old one is now over 8 years old and barely still alive. Cost doesn't really matter but should generally stay around \\~2k$ mark.\n\nI need it for a lot of different tasks, the most important ones being for CAD and 3D Softwares such as ArchiCAD, Blender, Sketchup, UE and also Rendering with VRay. I also produce music, which require lots of different VSTs to be opened at the same time. Lastly I want to be able to play most of the current games on highest settings (for now 1080p but potentially also 1440p) and also be able to at least run new releases 3 to 4 years into the future.\n\nI want to quickly list my thought process for each item and would love to know if that makes sense:\n\nCPU: Intel offers more cores than AMD which is great for quick CPU rendering and multiple tasks\n\nMobo: Had great reviews everywhere\n\nCooler: honestly just dont want to deal with Watercooling and don't really care about design\n\nMemory: at least 32GB especially for music production plugins\n\nGPU: Was debating between RTX 4070/80 and 7900. While I'm pretty sure the Ray Tracing would help with GPU dependend rendering, the higher VRAM and lower price makes the 7900 more worth it (???)\n\nCase: Basic with good airflow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqs27daslz5b1.png?width=1137&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7318657982e602e671c6d11661ec68898f6c275f",

Just annoyance because I did it AGAIN....not like there's all kinds of fuckin jumpers to deal with.

Mine didn't boot because AMD and motherboard vendors didn't coordinate very well and my board wasn't using the new version of the BIOS that actually supports Zen 3. And it doesn't have a flashback button. So thanks, Asus. Had to take it in to the shop just to update everything.\n\nI have to say that Asus, despite having a bunch of guides on how to handle the situation, always carefully avoids addressing the most obvious case: you don't have an older processor, the board has an old BIOS, and it doesn't have flashback. I probably should have taken it back to the store or gotten Asus to RMA it, but the whole thing was just a nightmare. Even AMD sending out old processors to let people flash the motherboard is such an awkward fix. They mangled this roll-out. Made even worse by the high demand for the processor.",

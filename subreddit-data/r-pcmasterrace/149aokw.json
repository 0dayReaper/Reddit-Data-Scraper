    "postText": "So I'm downloading a fairly large game (160 GB) onto an HDD because each of my 2 individual drives have got around 146 Gb of free space. I was wondering if I could split said game into two parts after downloading onto the HDD and then split it across each of my SSDs so I don't have to compromise performance\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks.",

Install to the external, change the drive letter back to E. Power off and reconnect your D drive\n\nNow copy things to the 'original' d drive, and use mklink to send some stuff to C drive.. that might work",

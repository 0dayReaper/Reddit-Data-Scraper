I'm wondering if that is enough or should I still get a heatsink for the SSD separately?\n\nI plan to use the SSD for installing games and other apps so I don't know if that impacts the temperature.\n\nHere is the link to the adapter: \nhttps://s.lazada.com.ph/s.SXFLJ",

Most of the time, you're only reading and writing little bits at a time. If you were to hit it with a big, sustained write or read job (write is more taxing generally), you might overheat it.

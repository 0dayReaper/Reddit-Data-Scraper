You pay one fee (taxes are the equivalent here) for access and you can drive wherever you want at a serviceable speed.\n\nEDIT: Highway is not as good of an example as I thought. We don\u2019t have tolls where I live, so it makes a bit more sense. Introducing tolls causes the whole comparison to collapse.",

It is a policy that has twice been rejected by the courts.\n\n&gt;Allowing such a policy to move forward would shoehorn the most transformative technology of our lifetime into an outdated regulatory scheme designed with the old monopoly telephone system in mind. It also would stifle innovation and investment. Such heavy handed regulation of the Internet has resulted in slower speeds and an increasing lag behind new technology. I believe in a free and open Internet that rewards innovation by forcing companies to compete for their customers' business.\nSincerely,\n\n&gt;Earl L. \"Buddy\" Carter",

Microtransactions increase their profit margin which is their purpose as a corporation. Their purpose isn't to entertain us in some moral way. It *should be* if they were a company that cared (see indie publishers), which is why it's reprehensible and why outrage is justified, but their use of microtransactions is also justified, I think. They're free to use those shady tactics just as much as we're free to not give them our money.\n\nThe purpose of government is to serve the people, represent them, and do what's best for them. Killing off net neutrality is the complete opposite of that, doing so for the benefit of the minority (the 1%) at the expense of the working and middle classes. And they do this because of the relentless lobbying which are bribes that Senators and House Representatives just can't seem to resist. Fuck the people, get money, right?",

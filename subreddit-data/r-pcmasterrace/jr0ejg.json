Most people will end up with a password using words in the top 10,000, in this case I want to say only one of the words isn't in top 10,000 but been a while since I checked. This is better than a short hard to remembered password for sure but if using a password manager like LastPass why not long and super easy to remember(click autofill done). \n\n\nEdit: several typos",

But then you still need to meet site requirements of numbers, letters, and capitals.\n\nAt that point you're at CorrectHorseBatteryStaple!23 (don't do something THIS simple when altering your password, be more creative) is significantly harder to guess, even on a dictionary attack.\n\nEven so, a password is never meant to be your only line of defense. That's why any site worth its salt will lock it after only a few failed attempts. But, let's say they get lucky, the site doesn't lock it, and they guess it. This is why it's important that they all be different from one another. Never rely solely on a website's automated security to save you.\n\nI purposely avoided things like 2FA and token, since most people can't be bothered by such things. That's why I start with getting them to care about the password itself.",

This comic is just a pet peeve of mine since I work in information security \n\nEdit2: also I misread your original comment, you did recommend randomly generating non-master passwords so my bad on that.\n\n\n\n\n\nSure but if password manager enters password for you it is 0 added effort to make a more secure password. Changing password to be 21,22,23 etc doesn't much help. Got a leak of passwords? Enumerate. \n\n\n2fa is great where supported but is not infallable, see people with hacked accounts for crypto in exchanges, and if first factor(password) sucks adding a second factor means one weak one good, why not 2 good since password is auto entered? (side note, sms 2fa is much worse than, say, google authenticator). Also if all your passwords except for master password are in vault that means you can commit to one hell of a master password(+ 2fa)\n\n\nWhere it isn't supported horsebatterystaple!23 or other minor variations adds little complexity. Hashcat will let you use a modified dictionary attack that enumerates, for example, word-word-word-specialchar-number. Now I will grant that generally \"better than most\"(ie not year-season)is good enough as attackers will go for an easier target, but this is far from the end all be all on password complexity. \n\n\nAs for locking out after 3 attempts? Password spray season-year and you will get at least a few accounts, extra benefit of being less noisy than locking out 30 accounts(though still detectable as a threshold alert on total failed logins)",

I never have issues trying to solve those.\n\nAnother one I don\u2019t kind is the \u201cslider bar\u201d ones. I guess it determines your reaction time and motion of the slide bar? If it\u2019s irregular it\u2019s problem human.\n\nI know Google recaptcha has a version 3 for more than a year now (most of what we see with all the images is version 2), but version three asks no questions at all. It just monitors click and mouse behaviors and likely other factors like IP address, etc. then it lets you through if you pass the invisible test. I\u2019ve never failed the human test in those so I have yet to know what they do as a backup measure if you do.",

It was 23+4=? I typed in 27 and was told an incorrect answer was entered and was asked to try again, with the same question. I thought I had accidentally pressed 6 in place of 7 or 3 in place of 2, so I did 27 again, but once more I was told wrong answer. I thought it might have been an issue with the internet connection and very carefully did the same question again and made sure to check it was 27 before submitting. But still I was told I had given the wrong answer.\n\nThat was when I realized it was weibo fucking with me all along. I still remember the question clearly and that it was the last time I have ever even tried to access that website. Fuck them.",

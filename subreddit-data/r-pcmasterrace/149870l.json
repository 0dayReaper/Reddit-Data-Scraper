I've tried everything! First, I thought it was a pump itself. But no, after lots of tests I've found that at some speed those fans are resonating. And making sound which hard to describe. Imagine if someone blowing the bottle (or wind doing it). Or if take piece of paper or foil and start to blow to make a sound. It's quiet but very hearable!\n\nThis is really driving me crazy. Sound is coming and going randomly, depending on fan speed. Most annoying, even when I'm playing in headphones, I sometimes can hear it. What is worse - my wife is working playing near me, and this noise also making her crazy.\n\nFans itself are MasterFan MF120 Halo. They are silent. Funny thing, I've bought another 3 of them an put them in front to match the fans from CPU cooling. And they are foking silent! I thought I have defective fans on cooler itself. So, I changed them in place with those I've bought. And wadda you know? They start humming too!\n\nBy my opinion - problem is in the way they are designed and the way how they are attached to the radiator. CM is using long bolts. But design of the fan itself is very bad. They have rubber pads on the sides. But the hole for the bolt - is a solid plastic chassis. So, I don't know what engineers are thinking. But when you are using any screws all those rubber pads are useless! Because screw or bolt is directly holding the chassis. No amortization between fan and surface at all. What is very weird, it's when they are on the special metal panel for the fans - no vibration or resonance at all. But the bolts attaching them to radiator are much tighter.\n\nI tried almost anything. I tried to use rubber pads between fans and radiator. Not much success, cause screws are long enough to have like 3mm out from fan. To not damage the radiator. I drilled all the holes on the fans to make them deeper and put rubber rings on the bolts. Helped a little, sound is still there.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't screw them separately. I have Cosmos C700M chassis, and it have great removable metal frames for fans and radiators. Problem is - if I'm putting radiator first, I'm unable to screw the fans. Radiator is blocking access. I can't put 3 140mm fans either. Frame have a space for them and holes for them are outside of what is radiator covering. But hoses are blocking 3rd one, so I can put only 2.\n\nI'm out of ideas. I want 3 fans there. But how I can put them on? I thought to buy Corsair iCUE LL120 RGB. They were recommended as the best. But what if they also start to resonate with this tight bolting? I didn't find anywhere if they have independent rubber amortizations. :( Also, I want to have everything Cooler Master in the system.",

            "comment": "The fan frame design is flawed. There are large gaps that allow the air to pass through and create the \u201cwhistle\u201d noise. It\u2019s also bad for cooling performance since the static pressure and airflow both take huge hits.\n\nMy suggestion? Get rid of all those fans and replace them with something like Arctic P12 PWM PST or Noctua A12x25 PWM. The latter would be much more expensive, but a better choice since they include rubber gaskets for mounting them to radiators with minimal pressure loss.",

I never thought about this gap! \n\nI love Noctua, they are the best. But they are not RGB, and I wanted to have those purple circles. If I get them - I will be needed to install maybe LED strips. \n\nBut idea about rubber gaskets is very good! I can try to make them myself and see if it will help. If not, I really will try to buy Noctua.",

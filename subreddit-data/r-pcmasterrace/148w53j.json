Never tried push/pull due to clearance issues at the top of the case, but I usually settle on push since it just feels \u201cright\u201d. So yea, if this were mine, I\u2019d set the fan on the right pushing through the heat sink.",

The desired result is the same and it\u2019s achieved in conceptually the same way; that being to transfer heat off of the conductive element through forced convection. With a good static pressure fan that moves enough air, push and pull *should* have the same effect. For a cooling tower though, being that they have more gaps and routes for air, it\u2019s easier to control where the fan is pushing air through vs the fan pulling air from around the tower rather than through it. I\u2019d imagine you could get much hotter spots on the far side of the heat sink if the fan isn\u2019t properly sealed and/or there is enough gap that the fan starts pulling air from other areas of the case without moving it over the fins\n\nIMO",

He had posted every combo including spacers and the spacers got the coolest temps.\n\nThe reason this isn't more widely done is space and having to find longer screws.  The spacer dont need to be that thick either, I think 5mm you would see a benefit vs no spacers at all.",

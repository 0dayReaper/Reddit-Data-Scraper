    "postText": "I built my PC around February-March 2022\n\nMotherboard: Asus Rog Strix b450-f gaming ii\n\nGPU: Aorus RTX 3070 - Lian Li RGB GPU Cables\n\nCPU: Ryzen 5 5600x - Asus ARGB AIO\n\nRam: 16GB Corsair Vengeance (2x8)\n\nMy case fan also is a hit or miss when it runs and during the UK Heatwave right now, I'm not trying to run anything insane on it but I don't have the money to grab a new fan at this moment, times are tough. Wallpaper engine crashes a lot but recently has been running and I realised my idle and gaming temps have been 70-77 back and forward. Now Wallpaper engine has just crashed a few minutes ago and it is now 53 stable, not fluctuating.\n\nAny advice?",

            "comment": "Of course, Wallpaper engine does require both CPU and GPU resources when running so increased temps are expected. It should become \"dormant\" when gaming so it shouldn't have any impact on that and that's reflective in your 70-77c temps when gaming, which is incredibly low temps for what I assume is full load. \n\nNothing sounds out of the ordinary to be honest. Maybe it's update issue with either wallpaper engine, windows or GPU drivers?",

I had been told in regards to my case fan, it might only spin when necessary so in that case I will monitor both idle and gaming temps even further and maybe stress it a little to see what  the circumstances are. Maybe I am worrying too much but it seems unusual for my fan to stop spinning. I haven't seen it spin in a week, but then again I haven't really done much with it in a week.\n\nI appreciate this comment  :)",

As long as you stay below 90-95c you're fine. Idle temps between 40-50c is also nothing abnormal, especially on warm days like this one. Today is ridiculous in Sweden. Fucking 30c! I'm basically an eskimo. I didn't sign up for this shit!\n\nBut yeah, keep monitoring your temps if you're anxious, if only for your own peace of mind. But I don't think you have any reason to worry. It's just wallpaper engine throwing a fit for some reason.",

Your gpu will NOT idle while wallpaper engine is running so it will generate more heat. As  for the fan issue. Google \"Fan Control\" app on github. I have been using it for over a year now to control all my fans including my gpu.",

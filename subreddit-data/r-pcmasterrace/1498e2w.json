    "postText": "Hi all. So i built this pc about 5 years ago. \n\nIt has a first gen ryzen\n16gb ram\nB350-prime mobo\nWith a rx590 fat boy. \n\nThe thing is the pc just suddenly doesnt want to boot. The motherboard seems to have power (the LED in the PCB is light up its nirmal red) and the lan port seems to be flashing with activity. Pressing the button on the case does nothing.  Just need some advice on what i should do first (i.e replace cmos battery). My last resort will be to use ny partners pc parts (mainly psu) to see what is in fact broken. (they had built their pc earlier this year and everything is working on their machine. \n\nAny help is appreciated \n\n\n(With reddit being dark i can't read a post made on pcbuild so im askibg here)",

And later on when they finally came out with pcie4 able extenders they were very expensive, a tad bulkier if i am not mistaking and way shorter (well less important but with 3 you could extend the thing a few meters now i thing its 40-50cm max so fancy wall mounted display pc need thorough planning). Also lots of accessories still have pcie 3 spec because it is so much cheaper.\n\nNow if you have a pcie 4 slot and a pcie 4 graphics card and didn't notice any issues then congrats the riser is pcie 4 else it is likely it wouldn't have worked unless you went in to the bios vefore installing the gpu and there switch the slot from pcie 4 signaling to pcie 3.",

That would give a ton more clearance. Also depends on the heat sink fin orientation. I noticed if the fins run perpendicular to the long side of the card that helps with passive cooling to a degree which lowers temps slightly on cards with fans that have a 0 rpm mode. it might also help while the fans are running but its so negligible its immeasurable.",

Activision's publishing-output has been bone-dry for many years now; stripped down to Call of Duty. Now they're going to literally beat Blizzard to death to get the most profit out of their IP's, and I'm not buying any of it.",

I even had some friends on consoles that were going to get it so that we can play together. \n\nNow after this whole blitzchung event and how blizzard handled it, I am just disappointed. I deleted my blizzard account and never want to get another game from them again. There are plenty of other companies out there that are making great games that I can play instead.",

I've tried to get friends into the game but they just get frustrated and give up. \n\nIf valve put effort into tf2 again and fixed comp mode among other things I'm pretty certain you could see a big resurgence in its popularity, not that it's really died, it still gets like 50,000 players a day 12 years later. But after playing this game for 7 damn years it still has so much potential.\n\n/rant.",

So basically they need to release a new game, on an updated engine, in order to bring PvE that is actually fun to play rather than just updating Overwatch.",

Still shitty, but goes from robbing someone who believed in them, to just being incredible assholes towards them.)",

Its fine doing something with your own resources, but violating a contract and promoting your personal political beliefs on the company stream is not ok",

Pleasing China was obviously a big part of that, but it's not in the same realm as firing someone for speaking out in a newspaper. As an example, lots of hearthstone pros have since spoken out on their own platforms or on places like twitter and had *nothing* happen to them. \n\nI agree that naming-and-shaming might help with causing companies to change their ways, but I don't think that's actually being achieved here. Hollywood is still bending over backwards for China, as is Apple, Riot, and likely 90%+ of all international companies. But they're barely seeing any backlash at all. The only reason Blizzard is in the limelight is because they were unlucky (and because gamers are fickle at best).\n\nIf \"sending a message\" is good enough for you, that's great. But don't be surprised if people want more to happen than that.",

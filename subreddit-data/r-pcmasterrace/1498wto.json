    "postText": "\\*I need assistance\\*\n\nMy old ram is 2x8 and is supposed to be 3200MHz and is in slot 3 and 4\n\nMy new ram is 2x16 and is supposed to be 3600MHz and is in slot 1 and 2.\n\n\\*\\*How do I get my ram to be set to 3600MHz? I select the profile, and then set it to 3600 and then save and reboot. The screen flashes black a few times, PC shuts down, reboots again and loads the OS as normal only to notice that my ram speed is only going to \\*1798MHz for the 3600\\* and \\*1200MHz for the 3200MHz\\* How do I fix this? Do I need to remove the old ram and keep only the new ram?",

It\u2019s directly translated from dutch, so i hope it makes sense.\n\n\n\u201cIdem is an abbreviation of idem ditto, often written in dutch as idem dito.  Idem is a Latin word, ditto has a Latin origin and can be found in dictus, detto, ditto in 17th century Tuscan.  It is a past tense: said, meaning what has already been mentioned.\n\n Idem stands for 'the same' and ditto for 'exactly'.  In written form, the word idem is usually used in bullet points and then refers to the previous text\u201d",

Countless studies have shown that playing video games does improve your problem solving abilities as well as your abilities to strategize and cooperate (depending on the kinds of games you spend most of your time with). \n\nSocializing isn\u2019t problem solving in the same regard. There is no clear cut solution or set of rules like in a video game, and your success in social situations is really dependent on your charisma and your concept of social norms. If you don\u2019t have a good basis you can\u2019t build off of that.",

(Nzxt case and custom cables, you get the idea). We eventually even played some games together. They slowly realized this is a hobby more than an addiction. And I am more into technology and stuff. \n\nShow them your system. Tell them about it. Explain your decision making to them. Just talk to them. The more you involve them into it the less judgemental they will be about it. At least, in my experience. \n\nGood luck.",

On that bloody computer he told me and sure as hell she was. Playing virtual farm on Facebook for about 3 hours while the old fella was doing the real garden.\nShe ended up creating about 5 Facebook accounts so she could share all the gold/crap between the different farms for a year or two.\nBut ask her to copy a file in windows?

That's what you paid for. \n\nWhat if it works for two months before it gave up, because of micro pre damage (in my opinion that's not very likely but wouldn't take a 5% chance for expensive stuff)\nThen support can claim \"it has worked just fine. The damage now, must be your fault\"\n\nThere is no need to play risk with damaged stuff.",

If the unit is legitimately defective, THEN that's your cue to contact the component'sanufacturer.

    "postText": "I saw the other day a 650 dollars deal that comes with 16gb of ram and a Ryzen 5 5500 + gainward rtx 3060 ti and 2 1TB SSD. would you say it's a great deal for this price? my guess it will be more than enough for maximum setting 1080p gaming experience? \n\nmy only concern is gainward mostly cause i've never heard of them before. should i go for it or look for a better (perhaps more reliable) brand/deal?",

I assume that this is new and with warranty? If used 100% not worth it.\n\nRegardless, I'd still prefer to build my own PC and get a 6700 XT instead of the 3060 Ti. That said, Gainward is no better or worse than most other brands.",

Even after you uninstall it, some software stays on their system and it'll prompt them to renew their subscription and reinstall Norton, and old people being impressionable they see the computer telling them to do something and they do it. You have to go download an actual cleaning tool to *fully* remove it from your system and stop the prompts. \n\nMy grandfather is the most technologically inept person I know. We knew there was no way he knew how to intentionally seek out Norton.

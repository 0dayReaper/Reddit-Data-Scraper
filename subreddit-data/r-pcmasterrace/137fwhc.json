These people were well protected because of future defector recruiting.\n\nIf the Matrix was a bit more political, you'd probably have a lot of ex-Matrix exiters broadcasting to those outside to come back and how much life is better in the Matrix.\n\nAlso the Matrix enemy isn't evil or cruel. Its just running a system it thinks is best and how it thinks its best to deal with human beings which have shown themselves to be pretty troublesome. It has no desire or incentive to hurt people for fun. Letting Cypher have all he wants comes at no cost to it and hurting him only has downsides.\n\nIf anything, the Matrix seems benevolent to plugged-in human beings in general.  This is why the movie has such an interesting moral problem. Being in the Matrix is just fine, other than some people having an itch to scratch about desiring more or sensing its artificiality.",

If you pin a tab that is playing audio, it shows an indicator that sound is playing and you can click it to mute. Well due to the size of the tab, it can be pretty hard to click the tab without clicking on the mute part. I would like to see an option to double the size of pinned tabs or at least while they have audio playing.",

Articles automatically get synced and downloaded without any ads or website fluff. Then when you have some free time, for example on the bus or metro, you can read your own little newspaper on a paper-like screen offline.\n\nBut it should be an extension, not bundled in the browser by default. The only reason for that is money.",

The simple fact is that producing a modern, performant, standards-compliant web browser is both expensive and relatively hard to monetize so there's not going to be much competition. Google seems to have gotten into the game almost entirely because everyone sucked (especially at Javascript) and they needed *someone* to not suck in order to have something for everyone to run their Javascript apps in. \n\nThere's never been much competition and anyone who thinks otherwise is remembering the late 90s-early 00s wrong.",

Google, as most people know, is not the most trustworthy company in terms of privacy, and is a for-profit organization constantly pushing their products on the userbase by any means necessary, including some shady moves like we had in the past, when some websites would intentionally not work on Firefox so users were forced to download Chrome instead.\nNow, I'm not saying Mozilla is perfect, but honestly, they are a non-profit, pro-user organization, constantly trying to teach the good morals and ways of the internet, doing anything in their reach to protect internet users' privacy, regardless of if they use their browser or not. And while talking about Firefox, it's a stable, privacy focused browser that has a mission to remain independent while still being efficient and decently fast.\nI am not saying I will look down on anyone using other browsers because either that person doesn't know better or doesn't really care. But I do try and encourage my friends or relatives to try it out, as it's a browser that represents my morals and thoughts on internet privacy and user-provider relationship.\nHope this cleared it up :)",

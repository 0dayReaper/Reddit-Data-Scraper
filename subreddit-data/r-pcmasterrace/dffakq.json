Say what you want but with everything going on around Hong Kong, them blatantly siding with china over freedom of speech isnt something thats done in games.\n\nAlso, the fact that Blizzard basically fired 3 people (2 casters, and the pro player isnt likely to be on the Hearthstone stage anymore) over just someone saying something about their home after winning, irrelevant to what it is about, isnt something any other esports company has done.\n\nSaying people will forget and saying its happened before just devalues what the player said. Hong Kong has been in the news for weeks, and is only picking up traction especially as Trump becomes more involved in it as well, if this makes big enough news itll be associated with it just as commonly, and I am already seeing non gaming subreddits and news sites posting articles and stories about this specific event alone.\n\nAnd its starting to happen to Riot which is doing their world's league of legends tournament right now. People have started noticing casters being uncomfortable saying Hong Kong when talking about teams, instead saying HKA, the abbreviated team name. Whether or not its just a reaction or something more is proven I think just by the fact that tencent is also invested into Riot.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: http://bmkgaming.com/statement-on-blitzchung/ &lt;- statement from Brian Kibler (Not involved personally) explaining the facts of the event, then with his personal opinions on it for those unsure of what everyones on about.",

They can't ban them all, and even if they did the replacement ones would have to continue to speak up. Best way to protest this TBH. Pro gamers need to pull a true kapernick/BLM and go ahead full steam. Every single one of those players should mention Hong Kong in some capacity. Again, even if blizzard banned them all there would be replacements who must continue to speak up. or, they would have to pull the transmissions or stop the players from speaking, which in and of itself is admitting defeat and siding entirely with the no free speech side, will cause even more controversy. It's a win win if they all work together and stand with each other. But they all have to say something.",

The policy was strict, so even if your first kid died in childhood, you didn't get a second crack at it.  If you had an \"unauthorized\" pregnancy, the only way for most people to carry to term was to avoid all \"official\" medical care and use a midwife.  Once the baby was born, they were a citizen on good standing, though the parents may or may not end up on the Party shitlist. \n\nAlso of note, because Chinese culture (like many others) values male offspring over female, this policy resulted in a vast number of sex selective abortions, official or otherwise.  This is one of the reasons for the huge sex imbalance in China.\n\nPer usual in China, exceptions could be obtained via monstrously huge bribes to certain party officials who could \"authorize\" a second pregnancy.",

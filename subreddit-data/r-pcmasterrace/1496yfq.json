A PC is more expensive, you got to build it yourself, troubleshoot it, and sometime mess with game settings and stuff. For people who play only things like CoD, NBA 2K (which is a controller game) and Forza, a Series S or X is the best option in my opinion.",

For $1000 you could be more liberal and not have to skimp on pretty much anything. This would be perfect world for a great mid range PC.\n\nSo $800 is the happy medium where you can build something really good without breaking the bank.",

But that's just tower alone cost, not extras like keyboard, mouse, monitor.",

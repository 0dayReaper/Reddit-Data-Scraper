            "comment": "Full story:\n\n\n- Bought a 4k EUR MSI Raider GE67 HX October last year from computeruniverse.net (third party authorized reseller), laptop arrived early November IIRC\n\n- After first sending my laptop to MSI for repairs in March due to some weird unrelated issues, MSI sent it back, [but damaged (pics here)](https://imgur.com/a/M3lpueU). Third party service for sending and receiving were both provided by MSI (UPS).\n\n- I sent it back to them via UPS (provided by them again) to fix the damage they had caused.\n\n- They fixed it and sent it back (I finally got it back May 30th).\n\n- Now I have a laptop that had physical damage and then was repaired. So essentially a \"refurbished\" laptop that had to be fixed **due to a damage that was no fault of my own**.\n\n- I still don't know how the damage happened or the full extent of it. MSI refuses to accept blame, even though damage was caused by them or by a third party delivery service provided and paid for by them (unlikely due to the nature of the damage, looks like someone was trying to pry it open).\n\n- I want to return this laptop and get my money back, as this is a long term purchase meant to last 4+ years and I have no idea how the damage / repair has affected its lifespan.\n\n- computeruniverse.net will only start refund process if I have a letter from MSI where they admit they caused the damage\n\n- MSI refuses to admit responsibility\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n- I'm never buying from MSI again, and recommend you don't either\n\n- If you buy a laptop / pc / pc part from one place, go through it for repairs even if it takes longer. If you go straight to the manufacturer you're in for a headache if you have any issues.\n\n- Before sending and before opening anything received from repair, record a video of you opening the package and inspecting your goods, otherwise the company will never acknowledge any damage they might have caused",

    "postText": "Hello everyone, I've been planning and (over)thinking for a new build for over a year and am now decided to finally get it done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I'm not an expert, I would like some last opinons on this build before I buy everything, here's the list so far : [https://fr.pcpartpicker.com/list/N9s2pH](https://fr.pcpartpicker.com/list/N9s2pH)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor\n* Deepcool AK400 66.47 CFM CPU Cooler\n* MSI MAG B550 TOMAHAWK MAX WIFI ATX AM4 Motherboard\n* Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory (I'll probably double that later on)\n* Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 3.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive (x2)\n* XFX Speedster MERC 319 CORE Radeon RX 6800 XT 16 GB Video Card\n* Corsair RM750 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n* Corsair iCUE 4000X RGB ATX Mid Tower Case (Already owned, thinking about buying some extra fans as well)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm open to suggestions, tips, etc...\n\nMy current build is decent but won't be able to handle new games coming out (Starfield) or even games from the last few years that I really want to play like Cyberpunk 2077 or RDR2. \n\nAnother important point, I work full time as a graphic / web designer, I also make motion design and video editing so I need a good performance especially for After Effects and the like.\n\nI've also decided to gift my current PC to my mom once the new one is done and ready to go, so no parts to reuse from the old PC.\n\nThank you !",

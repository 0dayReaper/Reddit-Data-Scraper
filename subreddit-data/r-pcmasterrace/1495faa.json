The moment-to-moment gameplay is good and the artwork (environments, sounds, etc...) is nice as well. \n\nA big open question is the longevity of the endgame. ARPGs usually revolve around the chase for better gear and increasingly difficult content to use this gear in. That requires an interesting itemization system and content that people enjoy grinding. Frequent updates that add new twists can help keep things fresh. Time will tell how well D4 holds up on this front.\n\nDiablo 4 is not a cheap game. So to see if you enjoy the genre, you can try Diablo 3. It received a lot of criticism around launch (and most of it was on point), but through updates most of that has been resolved. It's a good intro to the genre. It does the moment-to-moment gameplay really well, but the endgame is fairly shallow. If you like it, there's a lot more depth to be found in other games (including D4 and especially in PoE). If you hate it, the ARPG genre might not be for you.",

It plays ok, the problem I see is that unless they lean into seasonal content like Path of Exile the game isn't going to have very long legs.\n\nTo clarify about the seasonal content in regards to POE, I'm talking about engaging things occurring while you're grinding for gear/levels etc. POE has had some bad leagues, but when you have 4 leagues a year the content that gets passed over adds up.\n\nD4 does have some stupid oversights like not having search bars for aspects and dungeons. The dungeons are also pretty lacklustre. Don't really have any complaints to make me say its a bad game, but unless they really spice it up with their seasonal content I suspect the playerbase is going to drop off pretty quickly outside of DLC releases.\n\nIts good for your first Diablo game though, I have no issues saying that.",

Yeah, playing through the game once or a couple times with different builds is fun. But grinding for the endgame is absolutely soulless and ridiculously boring, it's probably the worst end game grind I have ever experienced in any ARPG\n\nAlso not a fan of break points but that is a personal dislike",

All my game recordings and highlight clips go to my HDD, 1440p max quality recordings can use multiple gbs even for a short clip, so sticking them on a 3tb HDD that was ~70 bucks 3 years ago so they don't fill up my valuable ssd space I need for games works perfect.\n\nSSDs have gotten cheaper these days, looking at 4tb gen3 nvmes on Amazon is like 200 bucks which isn't bad, but 3 years ago during the chip shortage those were like 400, I looked.\n\n4tb gen4 SSDs still 350-400 bucks which is pretty ouch.",

It cuts down on assets used, mainly the vehicles.\n\nYou do know that HDDs and SSDs only effect load times right? You seem to be ill informed, as I don't know why you are saying your game runs at 1440p high settings. An HDD or SSD isn't going to make a difference your frame rate.\n\nHowever, HDDs will noticable stutter more than even a crappy SATA HDD. Only having 150MB/s to work with on todays games is really showing it's age. Because of this, newer games are now requiring SSDs, so I wouldn't even bother getting a HDD anymore unless you want one for backups or older games.",

Keep in mind that the nvme im comparing against is considered a premium option and to my knowledge is the best in the market, idk if the same can be said about the WD black. \n\nOn the other hand, 8 TB is like $170 from WD black vs $1000 from SABRENT.",

Some will hide loading behind a cutscene, or even a just a door opening animation. If the game is expecting an SSD but you're on an HDD then it'll likely stutter as the animation ends, which can feel a little off (much more so than an actual loading screen taking a while).\n\nLastly, and this is the biggest issue, some games don't so much \"load\" as stream data as you're playing. Particularly open world games, they don't want to section up the map, so they just pull in data as it's needed. Anything like that you'll end up with noticeable stuttering as you explore, and it'll suck.",

            "comment": "It'll mainly be for current gen games, since most older games were built around the gutless PS4/Xbone gen which had slow storage, netbook CPUs, and small amounts of unified memory at a time when SSDs as boot drives or hybrid storage was the norm. \n\nFor the current gen...\nSome games will need more RAM and VRAM to compensate for the low streaming bandwidth.\n\nGames like Forza Horizon 5 you'll see either pause for seconds at a time in the open world, or pop-in, or you bug out and fall through the floor along with warning messages. \n\nCyberpunk will have more pop-in, and that game also relies on streaming a fair bit, so you'll see more bugs where things don't load in right, or late. Anecdotally at least, game seems a lot more rock solid on SSDs, and I've been playing it since about day 6-7 on a Gen 3 NVME and have had minimal issues and the level of open world jank has been fairly minor. That was on mid crowds though with weaker hardware, and it's a little more chaotic on the roads with high crowds and the 5800x3D, but still not meme compilation-worthy.\n\nI know other games use asset duplication for HDDs to deal with the bad random read speeds, but solid sequential read performance. It's possible SSDs could at least somewhat keep game install sizes in check.\n\nSSDs are cheap enough - your time and sanity is worth it. HDDs are fine for secondary mass storage.",

            "comment": "Yes. Newer games utilize streaming assets to keep system RAM usage manageable while also allowing for larger and more detailed environments. \n\nHDD's will cause massive performance issues as the game will have to wait for assets to load into memory. Stuttering and crashes will become more commonplace as well. Some game engines don't play well with slow streaming of assets and can bug out and cause frequent crashes despite having an otherwise stable system.",

They are really only used in servers, data centers, security, etc.  An everyday consumer shouldn\u2019t bother unless you really need more than 4TB and you have the space for one.",

    "postText": " \\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE  - Buyer closed the return after I asked some basic questions about installation/motherboard/cooler/PSU quality and size, etc. No comment about why, but I guess it got sorted out. I still have a couple questions that may be helpful to me for future sales. \n\nI sold a K series Intel CPU on eBay and the buyer messaged and asked for a return and refund as he claims he is having issues with random reboots and when running memory test is getting errorsand then crashes (which he didn't have with his previous CPU).  As I don't offer returns (but eBay will force that on you in certain circumstances such as a broken/damaged item), I don't really want to eat the fees and shipping costs with a return if it's just buyer remorse, binning/overclockability that didn't meet his expectations, or improper installation/setup, but then again how do I go about confirming any of this? If he is telling the truth and he got a bum product from Intel, what's the best way to handle it? Should I push him to RMA it himself through Intel? I'm worried if I get the part back and try to return it myself, I may get denied due to him damaging it in someway (installation or overclocking damage?). How do I protect myself and come out of this with the least expense and risk? Does the CPU somehow have a history that shows if it has been overclocked at all? FYI, I do not have a motherboard capable of testing the CPU myself.",

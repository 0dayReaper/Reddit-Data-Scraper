They also have a sign they put up next to the front door for each 30-series card saying that they're out of it so you don't waste your time (I was *pumped* when I saw they were out of 3070s specifically the day I got my 3080).\n\nThey've also delisted their phone number from Google Maps and their web site.  I assume this is because they were getting dozens of calls each day about GPUs.",

It's not like the 30 series cards won't get bought at all, there's a line a million people long for them. If everyone got 1 card, instead of one person getting a million cards, they'd probably buy something else while they were in the store too. One person bulk buying cards isn't looking to build a pc, but 10 people buying one card probably want to buy other components as well.",

Some people are just batshit insane. Despite all that they don't give a flying fuck and stay resolute.\n\nOn the other hand, we also have another similarly big retailer who is pure shit. Most people who work there are handpicked world class turds and this company will be the first one to blatantly scalp when they can.

I can tell you that there were definitely ~~scalpers~~ people buying cards for their relatives in line.\n\nEDIT: wow this was a lot of responses. To answer some of the questions (keeping in mind this was like jan-feb so it might be different now): \n\nThe online inventory was how I figured out their stock situation. This allegedly can vary from store to store, but was really accurate for mine (Chicago).\n\nI showed up on a Tuesday 2 hours before they opened. Was 3rd in line between two others who came there together and were looking for a 3080 Strix (despite those not being listed and ultimately not there). Went there on a Saturday an hour before prior to that fateful Tuesday and that was nuts. \n\nPaid a bit more for a 6900xt but it was from board partner and not a \"founders\" edition for lack of a better term. It was nothing compared to what some have quoted in the thread. Even with MC's warranty thing, not even close.\n\nAs for the scalpers/family members. I was making half a joke really. I believe that there was a couple of people who were legit buying for family, but one or two were definitely changing stories and buying a second card for \"reasons\" plus plenty of dudes that were clearly clueless about the cards and just wanted to buy one for obvious resale. If you're buying for your family you're a genuine Saint at this point even if you already have one yourself. When I walked out of that store I was done. Got lucky with a Newegg drop later but I think that was cause the cpu was bundled. Failed them all up until then. If you don't want to see sketchy the red flags were knowing nothing and that being obvious, not having a clear goal of what to do with \"your\" card, and just not keeping shit straight (\"buying for cousin\" but suddenly cousin is brother).\n\nFinally scalpers are trash, glad MC is doing this. If I could get a card AND cpu without dealing with their trash, there's hope for all. It's tough but we all get there eventually. Good vibes to everyone on the hunt.",

They get the same amount of income regardless of if it went to a gamer, a content creator, a scalper, or a cryptocurrency miner.\n\nThis is why I like Microcenter - they recognize the cards are going to sell no matter what, so they're at least putting in some effort to help actual customers get the cards instead of people looking to get cards for profit. But for most other retailers, it's just extra effort that doesn't impact profits, so they're not going to bother.",

It also means that for most people they will but the rest of the build in the same trip so we get more out of it that way.

Not only that but you're forcing the right kind of customers to show up at your store (not people who are only interested in video cards)  \nThe fact is that anyone buying any new graphics cards online isn't putting anything else into their cart since you need to get it checked out and bought instantly - so online sales of graphics cards doesn't actually drive traffic that buys anything but the card - not better for Microcenter.\n\nSimilarly if you allow people to buy multiple cards in person - The scalpers/miners are looking for one thing and nothing else... all they go into the store to buy is a graphics card (which was going to sell out anyways).\n\nHaving a store with available graphics cards for \"regular\" users will drive traffic to the store that wants to buy multiple components (maybe they're building a new PC - even upgrading a PC if they aren't desperate for the card maybe they browse the store and decide to pick up a new monitor or something).",

Of course the internet has made things much easier for them to sell directly to consumers it's still not as easy as it seems. Also, what a pain it would be to have to go to a dozen different stores (online and physical) to build a computer for each part.\n\nEdit: it will also not be good for manufacturers to have a monopoly on the products. Having multiple retailers for a product is beneficial to consumers as it gives choice. Sales and incentives retailers give to intice people to come in are also great for consumers.\n\nEdit 2: yes, people already do shop at multiple stores but that's to get better prices. You have a choice to do most purchases at one store for convenience if you so choose. However, if manufacturers are the only place to get their product, there's no incentive for them to reduce prices because that's all they have: that one product. They don't need to try to get you to come for their other products because they don't have anything else to try to sell you.",

Specifically, I managed accounts like NewEgg/Amazon/NCIX/etc...\n\nWe started out doing D2C sales alongside retail and stopped for several reasons.\n\n1.) Volume - The volume of orders didn't justify the extra work.  The amount of time it took to process a single order for a kit of RAM or SSD wasn't that much less than a big order for NewEgg, and shipping prices weren't linear either.\n\n2.) Competing with your customers - When I started, our markup was lower than most of our retailers.  Especially if the market was fluctuating since my stock would often have a lower cost-basis than theirs.  Made it a real annoyance to build any relationships with them when I was constantly having to adjust web pricing to keep from accidentally undercutting them.\n\n3.) Support - Supporting your product is one thing.  Supporting a sales portal is a whole other thing.  Fraud, kids using their parents credit card, etc...\n\n4.) Stock Management - If I only have 200 of a SKU, and 25 on order direct from my website and 200 on order from NewEgg, I have to balance NewEgg getting upset (or Amazon fining me) with honoring my obligation to my website customers.\n\nWe stopped doing D2C when our online volume started really picking up around '09.  It just didn't make sense outside of special cases anymore.  If someone called us looking for something really weird like RDRAM we'd help where we could, or if it was just a longtime customer that we knew and wanted to take care of.  Otherwise it was much easier to just direct folks to NewEgg.\n\nI'm an enthusiast and there were parts about D2C I loved.  Especially when someone called in working on a new build and I got paid to shoot the shit for 20 minutes and then drop some shwag in their order or make sure they got a kit of RAM that would overclock really well, but ultimately I also needed to put food on my table and the big retailers did that much more efficiently.",

The algorithm I'm building to solve my model has tremendous gains from GPU implementation, so I'd like to get my hands on one of the latest gen Nvidia cards, though it doesn't have to be a 3080. I'm already going to take advantage of the free computing resources at my university, but the people at the research computing center told me I should go ahead and build a pc to tune my algorithm before I submit my program to run on the cluster so I don't waste the limited allocation I receive. Anyways, long story short, any suggestions/advice? I've already started reading hardware guides specific to my field. I was planning on going for a bigger build but leaving it mostly empty -- for obvious reasons -- and expanding later. Relative to some people, I know quite a bit about computers; but, in trying to solve this problem, I feel a little out of my depth, and while I don't want to be spending upwards of thousands of dollars per month on cloud computing resources, I also don't want to lose valuable time that I could have spent more strictly focused on my research.\n\n(I could have asked this question in a forum, but your comment inspired me to ask you, too. I hope that's ok.)",

We got to the checkout counter and I was told we needed ID.  I said he\u2019s getting one and so am I and he doesn\u2019t have ID since he\u2019s 13.\n\nThey refused to sell me the second one but did thankfully allow me to get my wife from the hotel where we were staying but they only gave me 1 hr, she showed her ID and they allowed the sale.\n\nI\u2019m really glad they do this but it was a little frustrating that they wouldn\u2019t sell one to my son who didn\u2019t have ID. Still, I would rather this than the bullshit others are doing. I want REAL gamers getting the cards, not some shit stain that\u2019s throwing them on eBay before they get out of the parking lot.\n\nI just really wish there was a close microcenter",

The 3070 I got is arguably a better card than the 6700xt, but it was $260 less as well, so even if the 6700xt was a 'better' card in some way, it would have to be sold at around $700. Why should I pay $200 more for slightly better cooling and some RGB, but weaker performance ?!? Makes no sense.",

That weekend I drove the 40 miles to the Tustin location to pick up all my parts from micro center, including the i5.\n\nAll my products were ready for pick up except for the i5. The employees that were helping me spent over 30 minutes looking around their store and the storage in the back while constantly apologizing for the inconvenience.\n\nThen came the bad news: \u201cThere must\u2019ve been a mistake when the i5s were listed as available online because we actually haven\u2019t received any yet this week.\u201d\n\nI was BUMMED out especially because I drove so far down for this\u2014so close to finishing my first PC build. Then, the employee told me the good news: \u201cWe\u2019d be happy to offer you the i7 processor for the same price as the i5. Again, really sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nI was blown away.

So they are wanting that I actually come to MC everyday which is not happening. At least make it an hour so you can make trip from farthest point which is Boulder. Lot of their customers don't live close to a tech hub, we live in suburb and commute is more than 10 minutes unless u are in cherry creek",

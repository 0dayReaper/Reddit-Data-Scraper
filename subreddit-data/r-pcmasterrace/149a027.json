Third party apps require access to the API to be able to work, and many are used for QoL changes and mod tools to moderate subreddits. Apollo is a major one that is used by tons of people.\n\nIn protest, thousands of subs have gone private with some going private indefinitely due to the CEO stating that he'll just wait the two days and everything will blow over.",

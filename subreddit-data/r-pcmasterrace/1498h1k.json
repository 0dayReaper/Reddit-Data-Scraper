    "postText": "I'm trying to make a custom shell for the xtrfy mz1 wireless mouse pcb, I don't have a 3d printer so im gonna be sending a 3d file to someone to print it for me, but i wanna nail it first try cuz i don't wanna spend too much money on too many tries. This is my first time doing anything of this sort, I downloaded fusion 360 to try and model the exact thing I want, but measuring the pcb and everything else and putting all that into fusion is a pain, im dumb when it comes to this stuff, If anyone has ANY 3d models for the xtrfy mz1 wireless pcb, or the inside of the shell cuz i wanna reuse the side buttons and the dpi button so i need to also make a part to hold those, i would really appreciate it, so far I've only found the models for the outside shell of the mouse and the main switches, and I've measured every single part of the top and bottom pcb with a caliper (cuz thats the only way i know how) if anyone has any of that stuff or any tips on how I can make this shit easier for myself it would be amazing, thank you.",

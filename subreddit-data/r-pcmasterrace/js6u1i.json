I can confirm that getting promoted as a SWE, particularly to L6 and higher, really hinges on creating new products and services, whether or not they're useful or duplicative.\n\nAlso, most of that \"innovation\" is directed internally, towards internal services and APIs that are used by SWEs and SREs. Google internally engages in the nonstop creation of new tools and APIs, but nearly all of them are closer to a minimal viable product than a full solution to the problem they're aimed at fixing. Additionally, unless it becomes sufficiently popular, support for it will disappear within a few months, once the person working on it either leaves or starts on a new project.",

Remove depth so they look like text because text is the ultimate symbology and that is good.\n3. Remove color so they match the sleek monochrome design and you can change the two colors to match your brand.\n4. Remove the objects and leave it as random symbols based on other symbols that only people who already know the previous symbols would understand making the whole idea of icons worthless because designers are now getting paid to jerk off to lines.\n\nI'm not even joking. Look at the new HP logo. The new deviantart logo. The new patreon logo. The new firefox logo. Basically any time you have \"new X logo\" it's always trying to innovate in a way reminiscent of /r/IncreasinglyVerbose/\n\nThese brands are associated with their logos which are based on objects, and designers are paid to innovate it, make it fresh. But they can't replace the object by something else because them people won't recognize it. Since you can't change the object, and the CEO is telling you to innovate, you just create a symbol out of the previous symbol and the employer eats it up because company Y did it too.

Meet is awful, I can see what they were going for but I just don't feel like it works.\n\nThe problem is every single app icon they have changed has now lost their 'glance value'. You could tell what app was what without really even having to look. Yes, part of that is because you were used to them, but they were also so visually distinct from each other and each of them (with the exception of drive, I guess) clearly telegraphed what kind of app they were meant to be. Now they just all look the same and suddenly when they're grouped together it's just visually noisy. \n\nJust wait for them to do this with docs/sheets/slides/etc and you'll never open the right app first try again.",

I hate this notion that things *must* be changed when there's no clear reason. If a change is beneficial (such as clearer and easier to distinguish): great, go for it. I also can understand changes when new features are being implemented (e.g. when dark themes came about, some icons needed to be redesigned to accommodate both light and dark themes.)  \n\nBut change for the sake of change is dumb IMO. Aside from color changes, the PlayStation logo has been the same for 26 years now, yet five of the ten best selling video game consoles of all time are from PlayStation. They make minor changes to the logo to keep it fresh (change the colors and font), but also keep the fundamentals together: there's no doubt when you see that Logo it's a PlayStation. With Google constantly redoing their icons, it becomes much less obvious they are from Google. Also, Nintendo has had a very similar logo with only minor adjustments since 1983. Same with McDonalds (since 1968), Nike, Apple, and several others who have had basically the same logo for decades. Yeah, they change the colors, fonts and depth, but the shape stays the same. I'm not opposed to changing shapes if there's a compelling reason, but I hate change for the sake of change, particularly with app icons, as it just makes it more difficult to find and recognize them instantly.",

So it was install iCue/Aura and then make sure Aura is disabled in the Task manager startup tab and never runs at same time as iCue. Make sure you don't have any other software causing conflict.

I tried a few airflow styles but can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s the best. Currently it has intake in the bottom, and exhaust on the top....my logic being hot air moves up. Any ideas?",

And you want at least equal amount of intake as exhaust, if not more intake, so that there's positive pressure in your case. If there's negative pressure then the case will try to equalize pressure by sucking air in wherever possible, likely bypassing your filters and pulling in extra dust.\n\nI know this wasn't really your question, but I saw a few similar questions around here and I wanted to share what small amount of knowledge I could.",

    "postText": "Built my new PC last weekend and I can't install Windows 10 or 11. After exiting BIOS, I get a blue screen saying, 'Your PC/Device needs to be repaired' and it doesn't give me any options other than going back to BIOS. Every time I retry doing this, I see a different error code under this message and hence I'm not able to pinpoint on the problem. Created the installation media USB from Microsoft website on a 128GB USB 3.1 stick (not sure if this is too big for it). At first, I tried installing Windows 11 but thought it's not liking it for some reason and so I moved on to creating an installation media with Windows 10 and that did the same. \n\nI tried changing the boot priority to the USB stick. My 1TB NVME SSD is being detected as I can see that in the BIOS. This SSD is new and empty. Tried changing the BIOS mode to CSM instead of UEFI. Tried disabling secure boot and fast boot. Tried changing the boot mode to Legacy+UEFI. TPM is enabled. Nothing worked. Can someone please help me? \n\nP.S. : All parts are brand new.\n\nSpecs: \n\nCPU: Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz \n\nCPU Cooler: Corsair iCUE H100i ELITE LCD 58.1 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler  \nMotherboard: MSI PRO Z790-A WIFI ATX LGA1700 Motherboard  \nMemory: Corsair Vengeance RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-5600 CL36 Memory  \nStorage: Crucial P3 Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 \n\nVideo Card: NVIDIA Founders Edition GeForce RTX 4070 12 GB  \nPower Supply: Corsair RM850x Shift 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply",

You get options to skip the network check and having to connect with ms account.",

Sheesh.\n\nFor that you need a cannon loaded with grapeshot. \n\n&gt; Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. \"What the devil?\" As I grab my powdered wig and Brown Bess musket. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, \"Tally ho lads\" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.",

Most relationships that have money issues are the ones where one partner is spending money needed for necessities on hobbies. \n\nA favorite example of mine, I used to work with a guy who was constantly complaining about his debts piling up. We made great money so I didn't understand why until he was talking to a third coworker about his car. He was saying that he'd spent the equivalent of four month's salary on rebuilding old muscle car in the six months since he got the job. Couldn't understand why he was struggling to pay bills and his wife was pissed at him when he was spending literally 2/3 of his income on a hobby car.\n\nI have frivolous hobbies to the tune of about a hundred dollars a month. If my frivolous hobby could be measured in the tens of thousands of dollars then my partner would be totally justified in being upset about that.",

Computers to them are laptops that shouldn't cost more than $100-150.\n\nI'm glad my girlfriend isn't this controlling with spending.

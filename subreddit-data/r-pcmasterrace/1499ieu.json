    "postText": "Hi guys, just installed my new (used) RX6800 Sapphire Pulse into my PC.\n\nI uninstalled old drivers and installed new.\n\nWhen i open GPUZ, the BIOS version i see is completely different from the one on the TechPowerUP website.\n\nThe version that is inside of my GPU atm is  020.001.000.071.000000\n\nCan someone tell me what is going on?\n\nDoes this mean that the card was used for mining?\n\nThank you.\n\nThe person who sold me the card bought it 2 months ago, i have the receipt.  \n\n\n  \n( [https://i.postimg.cc/pLjfQHJh/gpubios.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/pLjfQHJh/gpubios.jpg) )",

But warranty isn't really the question anymore when their product **fails** spontaneously bursts into flame.\n\nWhen my graphics card dies I expect it to turn into a sad brick not a fire hazard.\n\nAny company where their product bursts into flames should have expedited a box to you with not just a replacement or upgrade, but also to get that card out of your hands as it's a massive liability. Not to mention their development team should want to know why their product in this instance decided to burst into flames instead of just turning into a sad brick. \n\nIf you contacted their support and explained that the graphics card bursts into flame and they told you they wouldn't do anything. You legitimately might want to get a consultation with a lawyer. You don't need to hire one, but I think you should at least have a conversation with one as absolutely *no product that anyone purchases should burst into flames when it fails*.",

I'm sure it's not a common thing, but I clearly explained to the tech support person I spoke to that it was true flames, and that the motherboard and PSU showed no signs of damage. The motherboard is theirs too, so even if it was the mobo's fault it would still be on MSI! To write it off as a defect and out of warranty seemed silly to me, especially when it was just luck that it happened while I was there the first time",

Went too pull out of the gas station and the rear tires hit the wet stripes and the truck spun out. \n\nWe were facing the wrong way so we pulled back into the gas station and did the whole thing again, including doing another donut.\n\nAt this point we think it's pretty cool, so we pulled back into the gas station and did it a third time, again with another donut.\n\nThis time as we pulled off the street and back into the gas station the local cop flipped on his lights and pulled in behind us.\n\nHe came strolling up to the window, taking his time, almost like he was going to enjoy what he was about to do. \n\nHe gets to the window and sees us staring back at him and in the most southern drawl I've ever heard he says:\n\n\"Boys, I know what's going on here. The first time was an accident. The second time was because you're boys. Now, the third time is a problem. I want y'all to go home and stay there.\"\n\nWe both just said yes sir and went straight home.\n\nSince then, twice is my limit. The first time is an accident, the second time is cause I'm actually 2 10 year olds masquerading as a man in a trench coat.\n\nMoral of the story, don't temp fate.",

My whole office smelled like burnt pennies for 3 days.My GPU was technically still under warranty, but due to a small mistake that happened when I first got the card(the rear locking tab got snapped off), it wasn't eligible for RMA.I took apart the card down to the PCB, and one of the inductors (an R47 inductor to be precise) was burned to shit, to such an extent that it charred through several layers of the PCB and warped several solder pads and chips next to it.\n\nOP, since your card is already out of warranty, would you mind also taking the cooler and backplate off the card and either posting or DMing me a few pictures of what was burning on the card? I'm not claiming to be able to help fix the card or anything, I'm just generally curious which part of your card got scorched (as mine was closer to the 8+6 pin PSU connector).\n\nEdit: Images of the PCB of my card [https://imgur.com/gallery/I8wmQ6b](https://imgur.com/gallery/I8wmQ6b)\n\nSomething I should note, when this happened in my case, I hadn't used the PC this was in for about a week, and had to disconnect my GPU power cables to swap some RAM.The first time this happened, I didn't even have the 8+6 cables in the GPU, this first happened when it was only pulling PCIe power(which was a mistake, but not a mistake that should have lead to this, as PCIe power is theoretically limited, and should only have led to a POST error).  \nEdit: Another note, that gaping hole is where the R47 inductor used to be",

Short term, which means you held the asset under a year, and long term, held asset for more than a year. Since this is about $GME it's probably a safe bet it's short term.\n\nShort term capitol gains tax is taxed at the same rate as normal income tax. Tax brackets in the US are done in buckets (first x dollars taxed at y percent, next z dollars taxed at q percent, etc). in the USA we pay both state and federal income tax (unless you live in one of the nine states without income tax). \n\nWithout knowing more about OP it's impossible to estimate how much he should hold.",

Somone noticed that they short sold upto +130ish% of the available stock, which drove the stock price down to ~$3 at one point, and started buying. Everyone else took notice and bought. Now everyone who has stock is holding until because hedge funds need to buy at rock bottom price to cover their contracts and earn money, otherwise they lose a shitload of money. \n\nHOLD YOU GLORIOUS BASTARDS! HOLD! HOLD FOR THOSE WHO BORE YOU! HOLD FOR THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE YOU! HOLD FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS LOST JOBS BECAUSE OF THESE MOTHER FUCKERS! HOLD!

Shorting is betting on falling prices, by first selling the shares and later buying them. \n\nShorting costs them money, a pretty big amount of money, each day. It's a fixed percentage of the value of their position. If we continue to hold, they soon can't afford to keep these positions open and they have to buy shares. There aren't enough shares for them to freely buy what they need to so they could be forced to buy shares at ANY PRICE.\n\nThis could be 400$, it could be 10000$, it could be more.\n\nIt seems like there have been a few instances where sell orders for around 2500$ were executed, which means that some Hedgefund guy bought a share for 2500$ when the price was around 300$ because there weren't enough shares. \n\nThat is the goal of the \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50",

Forced to buy at whatever the current open market price is, no matter how high it is. Knowing exactly when that is, is the hard part. But It does not appear as if the hedge funds have closed on all their positions yet. \n\nEven after that, when all these people try to finally sell what they're holding the rally will end and the price will plummet. Those cashing out with 100-1000 or so stocks might be able to capitalize on the peak price for almost all their shares. But those with a high volume of shares practically need to be the person starting the dump to fully realize the gains.",

In my case, the PC would randomly reset roughly within 2 minutes after entering Windows even when being idle (it would vary from a few seconds to a max of 2 minutes).\n\nI made sure to rule out any heating issues by immediately checking temps in the BIOS after the forced restart. In some cases I was also able to get HWMonitor running before the shutdown. Both clearly showed no temp issues at all.\n\nAs I could find no clear cause, I placed back my previous CPU and surpise, surpise, the PC worked without issues again. So I RMA'd the CPU and got a new one which worked without problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: if you only changed your CPU and you can rule out high temps, it's most likely a fault in the CPU itself. RMA it and try again with a new one.",

I'm just a silly tech and can't comment much either, but I wonder what was going on under the hood. Guess I'll be surfing YouTube tonight",

Desktop work and internet browsing did not shut it off.  Thermals were fine.\n\nI think I finally resolved the issue but it was incredibly hard to diagnose.  Like everyone else, we started with the power supply, updated BIOS, reset CMOS, reseated RAM and CPU, reinstalled GPU and AMD chipset drivers, prayed to the Aztec gods, etc...  Went down a rathole about transient noise being fed from the GPU back to the PS... turning off some cores of the CPU... crazy stuff.\n\nFinally got it a bit stabilized when I turned on XMP profiles in the BIOS, but it would still crash on some games.  Then I tried disabling Core Performance Boost in the BIOS and remarkably, it solved all our crashes and has been stable ever since.  Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Spelling",

If this is the case, I would suggest removing the CPU cooler, cleaning off the thermal paste, reapplying the thermal paste, and then mounting the cooler once more. When you mount the cooler, ensure that you are tightening the screws correctly. Ensure that the mounting screws are not over-tightened or under-tightened.",

    "postText": "I've had to put my PC on the ground since I have 2 monitors on my desk and there's no more space on it. But now it gets pretty hot and dry below especially in the summer, since the rear fan keeps blasting the back part of my desk and essentially turning the underside of my desk into a furnace, which gets pretty uncomfortable at times. \n\nMy only solution right now is putting a desk fan under the table to counteract the flow of hot air, but I wanna know if there are better ways that doesn't require replacing the desk.",

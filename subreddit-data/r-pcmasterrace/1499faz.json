First thing you can do is update the bios or just reinstall windows, reseat RAM modules or run a disk check through the command prompt \n\nWhen i did this for him, his pc booted as normal but would crash within minutes, sometimes even during the boot sequence. Apperently his cpu wasn't getting enough power and i had to increase the Vcore by a few mV. He hasn't had the issue since. He has a ryzen 3600x, gigabyte b450 elite mobo.",

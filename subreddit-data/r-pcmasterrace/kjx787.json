Up to then, processor manufactures were in a clock speed race, and Cyrix was still a standalone company and not owned by VIA.  When AMD started consistently beating Intel to the punch and with better performance, Intel iterated P3 tech and built out Centrino instead of trying to ride out with NetBust and RAMBust, which lead to evaluating computers at performance-per-watt instead of clock speed (I still remember articles from Toms Hardware showing a 1.6 Pentium M blowing the doors off of a 2GHz P4), and eventually the Core architecture that left AMD in the dust until 2019.\n\nIntel's trying to do this again, this time with integration and hardware scaling.  Adding ARM cores to an x86 chip is one way of doing this.  Another way is the standalone Iris GPU that's coming next year, which I think is extremely important, since Intel is trying to do something neither AMD nor nVidia have had long-term success with: multi-GPU processing that works universally.  There is still a strong demand for GPU scalability that the market currently does not meet, and having a solution that meets that demand would be a serious counter to the current threats from AMD and nVidia.",

Intel is only just being dented in their cpu monopoly in the server space, they are probably more worried about how much budget is going towards nvidia for gpu compute. Gpu compute had got to be a big area of research for intel even while they try to fend off amd cpus.",

Nintendo is still making gaming consoles using 45nm processors with a stand-alone GPU, and Intel is now in a position to sell much faster and cheaper technology than what Nintendo is currently using than AMD is.  Just keep an eye out if Nintendo decides that their next console should run off x86 tech, seeing how they've consistently positioned themselves as a budget-minded product, don't be shocked if Intel gets that contract.\n\nLet's also not forget about how the Steam Machine was going to be the end of consoles, until Valve realized that making a console was a hell of a lot harder than writing a version of Linux with a slick UI.\n\nThey may not be back in 2021, but there are already a lot of people who are thinking just because Apple designed one chip for laptops and Microsoft is just talking about it, that Intel has no more customers.  Intel has enough money that they could be in this kind of shape for the next decade and still be around; AMD did this same exact thing except off loans instead of their own bankroll.",

But its not like all these things suddenly happened in 2020, we all knew about Apple SOC, Consoles using AMD SOC, and Ryzen catching up in for some years. Intel problem of manufacturing 7/10mm is also nothing new.\n\nThat said, sometimes this sub makes it sound like Intel is close to fighting for survival. Its not, not even close. For example this sub takes the DIY for much more than it is. And OEMs are still heavily Intel favored (take business laptops for example) although also declining. Also said Server market is incredible huge and Intel is still dominating it so much that it would be a stretch to call AMD a competitor.\n\nBut alarm clocks should be ringing at Intel HQ. Loosing Apple was a huge hit and now MS is threatening to do the same although I am not sure much market share Surface products have.  If ARM turns out to be the future of servers, they are majorly fucked. If Ryzen keeps performing for years to come and gains enough brand recognition to be included in OEMs as much as Intel, than shit is about to get real.",

Companies make mistakes, it happens. Intel is still innovating, but their consumer desktop processor line is suffering majorly from a delay in technologies to make their next 2 or 3 gens viable. If they weren't interested in innovating, they wouldn't have sunk tens of billions into future nodes and techniques to make the smaller nodes viable. \n\nChill. They're fine.

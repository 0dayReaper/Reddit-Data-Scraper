    "postText": "I have an expansion card M.2 NVME to PCIe Adapter (3.0 x4) and will put an M.2 NVME SSD into it.\n\nWhat I plan on doing is to put this expansion card adapter into the second PCIe 3.0 x16_2 since I have a GPU with a PCIe 3.0 x16 interface currently in place at PCIe 3.0 x16_1 slot. Since the adapter only has x4 it is compatible to fit in the PCIe 3.0 x16_2 slot. \n\nThe adapter is x4 so I'm not totally sure if this will trigger the two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots into a lower mode.\n\nMy question is will this make the 2 PCIe x3.0 x16 slots run in x8 mode since I have this adapter installed in x16_2 slot thus reducing the performance of the GPU?\n\nAlso if it this setup does work without reducing performance of the GPU or any GPU, can I swap the GPU into the PCIe 3.0 x16_2 slot and the adapter into the PCIe 3.0 x16_1 slot? \n\nVery thanks bros.",

I'd just keep in mind it's going to be limited to PCIe 2.0 speeds (500MB/s per lane, so 2GB/s total bandwidth). For pretty much any practical task, 2GB/s isn't going to be a bottleneck, so I'd put it in slot 4 just to keep it away from stealing lanes from the GPU (and even if for some reason I'm not seeing it gets relegated to x1 mode (500MB/s)... I'd still keep it in that slot, depending on your use case).",

The SSD speed will be lower but 2GB/s is still really quick compared to SATA.\n\nWith that said, if maximum SSD performance is important, feel free to benchmark the GPU in x8 vs x16 mode. The performance impact may be minimal depending on your configuration and choice of games.\n\nI do need to warn you that you might not be able to boot from NVME without a bootloader on a SATA disk as the board probably does not have a UEFI NVME driver in the firmware. That didn't start showing up often until Haswell CPUs and the later Intel 80 and 90 series chipsets. \n\nTheoretically speaking you might be able to hack one into the firmware but doing so risks bricking the board if the resultant new image is corrupted.",

You won't get the full theoretical speed from say a Samsung 970 EVO plus, so keep that in mind if you haven't bought an SSD yet.\n\nPCIe 2.0 is 500 MB/lane, so at x4 (four lanes) you'd get about 2GB/s out of it.

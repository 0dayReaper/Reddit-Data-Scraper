The ELI5 version is that normally, something needs to be dipolar to be magnetic and take electrons through- ideally thigns like iron do the trick. However, when you kick the strength up, it turns out everything can be magnetic if it's got polarity on sides of it- this means you've got, say, iron in your bloodcells, the water flowing around you... all of it becomes magnetic. But here's the problem- it's all at different strengths. \n\nSo you've got tiny little pieces of iron doing that thing from X-Men 2 [basically like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAcs2uROaoI)- while your blood is also flowing at certain speeds in some directions, but not in others, and pulling against the edges of your blood vessels- all of them at once. Also, inside your cells outside your blood, everything is also yanking around, but not as hard... and sometimes in the other direction. \n\nSo... 1) Yes. 2) A LOT.",

If you have old or shitty wiring then powerline is potentially non-usable, which was the case in the house that I grew up in. I've also heard that if you have to cross a circuit breaker in newer wiring that that can also cause problems, but I've never played around with it in that capacity myself. I just hardwire everything since I'm a networking guy anyway at my day job. \n\nI think the main reason that powerline generally doesn't get recommended very often is because it can be extremely variable depending on the specific environment that it's installed in. Some people may have no issues at all and some might be worse off than being on wireless.",

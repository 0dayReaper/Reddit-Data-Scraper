You can test it out yourself. Then upgrade your CPU later if necessary. If you can afford to do both then now is a good time.",

In your scenario where you're trying to save money, I would also just upgrade the CPU, add a 1 or 2TB SSD, and then you have plenty of time to figure out the GPU before Starfield. My vote is on waiting until the Radeon 7700 releases. I have no idea when that is but right now the Radeon 6700xt is one of the better mid-range GPUs for the price. I don't have a whole lot of faith that the 7700xt will be the same price but if it's not, you can just get a 6700xt and you're all set.\n\nBTW I will just add that if I had a little more budget and we're in your situation, I would 100% buy the Ryzen 5800x3D.",

But in certain games, it was uncontested until the 7800x3D and 13900k. It all depends what you play regularly. Generally speaking, most eSports games don't care too much about the x3D and most other games do. But the x3D probably isn't something you want if you're gaming at 60fps. It's something that you use to help push you to 144+ in games that tend to utilize more CPU power.\n\nThe x3D carries a hefty premium over the 5600x but you should check out some reviews. But it's also worth nothing that most reviews use games that don't care too much for CPU power. But games like MMOs and a lot of multiplayer games make better use of CPU capabilities where the x3D will benefit greatly.",

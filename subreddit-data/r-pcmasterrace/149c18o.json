    "postText": "Hi all My PC is pretty old now. Specs as follows &gt;&gt;\n\nIntel I7 6700k\n\nGigabyte Z170X Gaming 7\n\nGTX 1070\n\n16 gb Ram - Corsair DDR4 2400\n\nSystem Drive SSD - Storage Drive HDD mechanical (i run my games from the HDD)\n\nSo then its pretty dated BUT still runs all the games i like at 1080 on high at steady 60fps.\n\nIm reading that some of the newer games like Starfield require 32 gb &amp; an SSD\n\nSo If i get an extra 16gb ram (matching) and a Crucial P3 2TB M.2 PCIe Gen3 NVMe Internal SSD will i be good to go at 1080p 60fps????  Cheers",

            "comment": "for Ram your 6700K might handle 3200Mhz and If that's the case, consider buying 2x16GB of 3200mhz CL16, which are priced pretty competitively today compared to buying more 2400mhz.  You have 2 M.2 gen slots on that board. Consider even buying a Gen 4 drive, that will reverse operate at Gen 3 speed, but when you upgrade in the future you'll already have a Gen 4 drive. Prices are very similar between gen 3 and 4 at $50/tb.  The settings of a game like Starfield might be able to get 1080p 60fps but that 6700K is getting pretty tired... Getting on 7 yrs old. The GTX 1070 is the clear winner of the GTX Pascal generation and at 1080p hold up quiet well even today. One of my sons ran a blower version for many years until he got 49\" ultrawide.",

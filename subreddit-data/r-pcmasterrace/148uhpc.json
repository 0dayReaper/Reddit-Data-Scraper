Its not listed on the amds website anymore, its discontinued but you need it for it to work properly and IT WONT INSTALL ITSELF from windows update because you probably already have it installed from when you installed your first am4 cpu.

I had Ryzen Master check the best values for Curve Optimizer, and I've put those values into BIOS by enabling PBO, though I put PBO Limits = disabled (stock limits). Luckily it not only lowered temps by a lot, it also improved   \na bit its performance (4.8GHz single / 4.6GHz multi boost). I've customized my fan-curve very silent, where I don't or barely hear it, even though its already quite silent (be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4).",

I have a 11900F (which is a 11700 with thermal velocity boost) and it was completely overlapping over with my other 5800x, just if you render on the intel it can suck more than 230w in the nick of time. Somehow it's easier to cool tho and can edge out a bit AMD in older titles that favour single threaded scores.\n\nI now have a 5800x3D, and that's giving the 11900F a very hard time.",

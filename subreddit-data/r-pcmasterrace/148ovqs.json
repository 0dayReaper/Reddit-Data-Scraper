Sanding should be performed if there is a confirmed short and potential benefit outweighs the risk of not doing it.\n\nYou are essentially saying full send a gpu over 10 minutes of probing to someone that has a DMM. At the very least, 12v and ground are the two pins seen on the pcie power cable connection, and that only takes 10 seconds to verify.\n\nGND is likely the only thing near that corner and screw hole.",

The fiberglass (FR4) for boards are almost always layered.\n\nI've worked on pcbbs and *from my personal experience*, there doesn't look to be any electrical connections that close to the edge of the board. The closest trace I can see is running from that connector in the upper right and by naked eye, I don't see any exposed copper between the layers. FR4 is multi-layered, so you never know, but even in prototypes I've worked on, edge damage like this shouldn't effect functionality unless it disrupts the ground plane or necessary vias/traces.\n\nMy only worry would be, like others mentioned, would be re-binding and sealing that break. Delamination (separation of the FR4 layers) could cause an issue if it eventually ends up separating any crucial conductive layers of the board itself, so keep an eye out for that.\n\nI honestly don't know if constant use or heat could cause further delamination, so someone else can comment on that.\n\nAnecdotally, we'll get bare boards from a board house that have minor delamination (some board houses SUCK with attention to warping and delamination), but those problems are usually at the ends of the board and don't cause real-life issues.",

Everyone around you seems to be saying, \"Ah, it's fine,\" but hey, let's face it: you dropped it from a height that's more \"basketball dunk\" than \"tiny hop.\" And not just on any surface, but a rough one! Yikes! The thing is, the real damage can't be known until you get Sherlock Holmes on the case and start taking that thing apart. Who knows, those components might have hairline fractures invisible to the naked eye. It's like a secret society of cracks, I tell you! They are sneaky little buggers.\n\n Sure, it might work temporarily, fooling you into thinking it's all good, but then bam! The vibrations, reverb, heat, or cold come in like a wrecking ball, splitting those hairline cracks into something worse. We already know you dropped it far and fast enough to take a chunk out of a corner. Imagine all the little screws holding that card together. They must be terrified! So, my bet is that you've got fractures flowing through your device, like little rivers of trouble, starting from where the screws connect to the case. Those poor screws must be crying for help!\n\nBut hey, let's not panic too much. It's always good to have a professional take a look and assess the damage. Who knows, they might even have a good laugh at the \"adventures of the dropped device.\" Just remember, laughter is the best medicine, especially when dealing with hairline fractures and terrified screws!",

No annoying services, no telebs, no forced ads or updates down my throat, on idle with just a couple of services running such as steam, audio drivers and a couple of other software running I see a CPU utilization between 0-3% while my ram usage is only around 500mb, this is imo the optimal experience. \n\nI also dual boot into Linux Ubuntu for stuff like compiling kernel and other linux related tools such as penetration testing I like to use kali, altho that is a rather recent distro I am using.\n\nFor me the reason why I don't daily drive linux is mainly 3 things:\n\n\\- Not very flexible with upgrades or new hardware/games, I do not appreciate the long waiting times to be able to play new titles or upgrade my hardware.\n\n\\- Instability when swapping hardware or updates. I don't know why but I'm pretty much have the same luck as linus from linus tech tips, I always manage to break Linux in one way or another by simply updating something and have to repair it again later on wasting my time fixing it. \n\nand most importantly:\n\n\\- Linux has way to many security problems. I can forgive exploits being found here and there, hell even somewhate late patches, but what I cannot forgive is that all Linux desktop distros put 0 effort into security. The fact linux lacks something as basic as sandboxing is just terrifying. Not to mention the extremely piss poor state of the linux kernel, it's full of exploits and bad designs. One of the best examples I can come up with is eBPF, the amount of exploits that keep getting abused and found combined with the intense severety of these exploits really doesn't make me feel comfortable using linux as a daily driver, the worst part is how these exploits get \"fixed\", it's seriously just a hotfix slapped in only for a very similair exploit to appear again. \n\n  \nSadly more and more devs are jumping off the linux kernel and jump instead on android, since even the linux dev community is extremely toxic and ironicly it is thanks to linus himself\n\n[https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-developer-who-took-on-linus-torvalds-over-abuse-quits-toxic-kernel-community/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-developer-who-took-on-linus-torvalds-over-abuse-quits-toxic-kernel-community/)\n\nHowever we see over the years that linus has calmed down more and is more mellow, now he's just sad about how the linux dev community is which ironicly has a lot to do with him leading this behavior to a standard over the years. \n\nOur hope is realistlcy valve to actually get linux modernized, which Linus himself also mentioned, Valve has done a tremedous job in terms of porting a translation layer to support tons of games and working on features for their linux version. I don't think the open source community will ever get their sht together, I lost hope on that one, however I still hope that valve may finally modernize linux to 2023 standards, adding all security features needed for a proper 2023 OS and make it a viable option for people who care for security. I really miss the days of good ol windows XP.",

If so, can you enable the beta channel for steam? Steam beta has a new GUI implementation that supports hardware acceleration under Linux. Also instead of Flatpak version, you might try the deb version of steam but Flatpak shouldn't be a problem (at least I never encountered any on my systems) but try every possibility.  \nIf it's happening outside of the Steam too, I don't know much, I never used Plank and It was years ago since I last used Cinnamon.  \n\n\nAlso some tips for the future:\n\n* Try to inform about your system before asking technical questions. The entire PC ecosystem (not just Linux) is really huge and small differences in the setup can cause different problems. For Linux, even a simple neofetch screenshot can help a lot to people try to help you.\n* Try to ask your questions at r/linux_questions r/linux r/linux4noobs or r/linux_gaming when they're out of the lockdown in the future.",

If you want to compare a dumb down Linux OS that is made to do gaming like Sony used to make and nothing else. Sure, I guess OP wouldn't have the issues either. No idea why he would want to use such an OS on a PC but it would probably work just fine. Linux for PC is a lot more complicated than an customer OS made to do nothing else but play Steam games. That is the explanation you wanted. Might as well compare Windows in Xbox to Windows in PC. One of them are doing A LOT more complex things than the other and will have issues. Especially if they used an OS that was barely supported. Might end up on Reddit asking for advice if that happened.",

You do realize that SteamOS follows the same software stack and drivers as your standard GNU-based Linux distro, right? SteamOS is based on Arch. The only significant differences between SteamOS and your average Linux distro is that it comes with Steam and has an immutable update system. What runs on the Steam Deck with SteamOS also runs on a desktop PC with Linux. The Steam Deck is, for all intents and purposes, a Linux gaming PC, from the hardware to the OS, so your claims about it being that much different so as to compare it to an XBox is patently false.",

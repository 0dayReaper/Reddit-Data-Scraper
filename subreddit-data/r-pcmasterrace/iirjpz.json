Like in real life, like you see in 3D mode of google maps. Without streaming, it estimates by itself and just plops in random buildings that correspond to the zone and geographical location. Is it high or low density office buildings, are those suburban zones or agricultural, are they European or asian style, etc.\n\nThe difference is accurate to real world vs \"good enough\" and to be honest, if yiu don't know the neighborhood IRL, the offline \"random\" mode looks just fine, it's credible enough. You just won't find your house there in the right place, it's all.",

Redundant nodes and 40Gbps switches for replication (\"backend\"), but I \"cheaped out\" on 10Gbps cards for data (\"clients AKA hypervisors\") access. SSD caching is a must. Total cost? $295K. Today I'd probably be able to fit 2PB in the same space for roughly the same price, so yeah, you get the picture.",

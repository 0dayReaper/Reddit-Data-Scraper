    "postText": "Cannot decide on whether to get an AMD or NVIDIA, choosing between the rx 6950 and the RTX 4070. Trying to stay around that price range. Open to suggestions! Ray tracing and dlss 3 aren\u2019t huge deal breakers for me. Right now I\u2019m using a Samsung odyssey g7 32\u201d 1440p monitor. Also building around said card, not too worried about other parts was thinking of Ryzen 7 5800x3D for cpu.",

Haven\u2019t tested it on some high end AAA games yet but I don\u2019t think it will have any problems with running any of them @ 1440p. \n\nBut AMD is probably better bang for buck right now",

It's not about the hardware in your rig, but the software in your heart! Your age, nationality, race, gender, sexuality, religion (or lack of), political affiliation, economic status and PC specs are irrelevant. If you love PCs or want to talk about PCs, you can be a part of the community! Everyone is welcome!\r\n\r\n2 - In case you are not a PC gamer because you think doing so is very expensive, please know that it is very possible to build a competent gaming PC for 500 dollars or less.

Potentially damaging the AIO radiator by not using the correct screws/forgetting the fans. Not screwing in your AIO pump with all screws, leading to bad contact to the CPU heatspreader. Using the wrong RAM slots, not taking advantage of dual channel memory. Mounting the PSU the wrong way around so it cannot cool itself effectively. The rest of the build might be a matter of taste/being in a rush.",

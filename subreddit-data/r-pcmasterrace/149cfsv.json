    "postText": "My PC has been randomly crashing, and it is getting more frequent to the point where it is not really usable. The crashes usually involve the screen freezing then turning black after a couple seconds, followed by the lights on my keyboard turning off. the pc fans stay spinning until I shut it off and turn it back on. This seems to happen even when there is no load on the pc. I checked the windows logs and nothing helpful shows up. I should mention that I have had multiple power outages recently while the computer is running, but these crashes happened before this as well. I have already tried reseating the GPU, RAM, and all cables. My gpu drivers have been reinstalled, but I haven't updated/ re installed motherboard bios in case it crashes while doing so.\n\nI don't have another pc to test the gpu in or another power supply to try out, so I don't really know how to figure out what the problem is.\n\nWithout buying/borrowing new components is there anything I can do other than reinstall gpu drivers, mobo bios and windows?\n\nSpecs\n\nMOBO - ASROCK B450m pro4 - 3 years old\n\nGPU - xfx rx 580 - bought used 3 years ago\n\nPSU - Thermaltake smart bx1 550w - 3 years old\n\nCpu - R5 2600x - 3 years old\n\nRAM gskill ripjaws 16 gb - 3 years old\n\nstorage - samsung 980 -  \\~1 year old",

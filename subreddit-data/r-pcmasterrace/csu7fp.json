For example Skyrim has at least a couple gigabytes of Civil War assets/quests/code/voice lines, which should have been cleaned up when they redid the quest line, but nope. \n\nFun fact, Oblivion doesn't have arenas in every city because they ran out of space on the disc for all the voicelines. So the dev in charge cut out everything but one questline and one Arena, which are in the Imperial City.\n\nIt was all a waste, the extra space was used to re-record the voicelines for one of the races *and they kept the entire set of hundreds of old voicelines on the disc as is, unused*.",

The current 5700xt and 5700 are better than the 2070 and 2060 which is what they were designed to do. The super cards take the crown back but they are still at quite a price premium and not by a whole lot.\n\n\nHere in Canada at least the 2070 super retails for around $670-730 or so depending on the board partner. \n\n\nThe new saphire pulse in conparision only costs about $550 and the red devil $600 which is quite a lot better value considering thats around  15-20% cheaper.\n\n\nAs good as it is the 2070 super is not 20% more performant than a 5700xt. \n\n\nI say this as someone who owns a 2070 super as well.\n\n\nEdit: \nBut I would like to say. Its not a great situation though. The 2070 super is still decidedly better than the 5700xt in many respects. \n\nYou will still see a fps gain of around 10% or so depending on the game if you shell out the extra cash.

Worse for them, the volume of units was low due to the blue laser shortage. They did their best to put out a damn supercomputer, which was cool and all, but nobody was asking them for one. Ever since, the pressure for bleeding edge hardware to play the latest games, even on PC, hasn't been a priority.",

It's getting into weird territory where the focus is on reducing the tedious optimization for developers because the graphics are more or less close enough for most cases (RTX vs traditional PITA shader config).",

This includes Ram, power delivery, cooling etc too. A slightly bigger GPU die with lower clocks is probably what they will use in the PS5\n\n- Due to likely lower clocks, they can get away with far lower binning than most desktop chips, reducing costs\n\n- Sony will get a massive discount because they are buying in bulk, buying just the chips, and also buying both CPU and GPU from the same place\n\n- Process maturing will push costs down significantly by the time they are out vs. current costs.\n\n- Playstations often sell at a loss anyway, but recoup it from their other sources. Its worth it for them just to ensure people are on their platform\n\nSony COULD potentially be getting a 2070S or better tier GPU for under 200 USD. Whether that leaves enough room for the rest of the hardware (raytracing too), and whether ot even *will* be as powerful as previous commenters speculated is entirely up fpr debate though. I just dont believe you can rule it out entirely",

They probably won't want to though since that was risky then and now. Realistically most companies could sell at a small loss or survive on tiny margins if they had other products that were making much larger ones. It's literally how Amazon operates, except they take it to a whole new level by subsidizing the marketplace side by reaching across industry lines and using AWS profits.  \n\nWe're still speculating on a lot of nothing, so who actually knows what they'll do though, I don't believe they'd do it again, but I guess it's possible.",

People seem to forget that it's not sony/ms that loses if AMD has to sell them chips on an expensive process for next to no profit.

So 85% play with a 1060 or lower (including all Intel HD).\n\nAnd 80% have 4 cores CPU or less.\n\n50% have 8gb of ram or less.\n\nUnder those circumstances, if we assume steam survey represents a good sample, I believe this meme could be pretty right.

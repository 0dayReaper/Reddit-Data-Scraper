Has never gave me any issues. This switches my one monitor(the right one), my keyboard and mouse, and has two more usb ports left, between my pc and macbook.\n\nMy other two monitors auto switches when I turn off one device. And I usually turn off the left monitor when I am on PC, no use for it when relaxing/gaming.  \n\n\n[Macbook dock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088FRS1W9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1): Do not recommend that much. it is a bit annoying when the first meeting arrives. I have to unplug and replug to get the headphones and webcam to come up sometimes. But I plug in my kvm usb and hdmi, second hdmi, webcam (cause I don't want it connected to my PC), and headphones to it.\n\n[Vesa Mount](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0798K58B4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) This is the 3 monitor vesa mount I use. Honestly, I love it, but there are some problems, like I can for the life of me get the tops of the monitor to perfectly align, but it isn't too bad. Also, it is one of those set once and forget mounts. Which means once you have your set up all set, you are not going to moving the arms as much as they are a bit stiff. Also the wire management hole is too small to actually fit any cables so it is pretty useless. But it is built well and looks great and I absolutely love it.\n\n\n[My setup for reference](https://imgur.com/gallery/AQAY1B7): Don't worry, I replaced the chair later as well\n\nEdit: Included Vesa Mount",

After enough usage the ports wear out and it's just such a pain in the ass, better to wear out a cheap little hub. Plus, more ports! I suppose if you replace often maybe it's not as much of an issue.\n\nMulti monitor KVMs can be expensive, but you can just get a USB 3 dock with display outputs if you aren't gaming. Only one cable to switch for mouse, keyboard, and both monitors.",

Still nothing, restart, nothing, replugged gpu, nothing, reseated cpu, nothing. I take a look at the back and see that he plugged the hdmi into the motherboard instead of the gpu. Why do they have to put hdmi ports on high end x570 motherboards when 99,9% of people aren't going to use CPUs with an iGPU.",

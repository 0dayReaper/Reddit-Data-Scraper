Basically, while GPU is idling, it's cooled passively and fans kick in when GPU reaches a certain temp threshold. This reduces wear and tear of the fans and they last longer, at least in theory :)",

At first i had it setup through the motherboard, tied to the CPU's temp, but in certain games that were very light on the CPU but not on the GPU it was causing my GPU's fan to spin quite fast due to having no case airflow\n\n\nThe software helped a lot with that. I have no idea if it allows you to do this with fans that are not intended to be 0rpm though, but i don't really see why not.",

I called asus got on tech support guy looked it up and told me it won't spin at idle u less the PC is already over 60. So he got me to run a game. And ofc they spooled right up. I felt like an ass but eh the more we learn.\n\nMy new 3060ti the fans rarely even come on. I'm super fuckin happy with it.",

It's rated for temperatures in excess of 100\u00b0C. If anything, a narrower temperature range between idle and load is technically better, because it reduces physical stress from heat cycling. \n\n&gt;seems to be having issues\n\nNot due to zero fan mode, I guarantee it.",

I normally prefer 2 DIMMs but this kit was on sale IIRC. my Asus Prime Z370-A that I had back then just wouldn't accept it, i was only able to get stable with XMP off.\n\nas for your scenario, i wouldn't worry. buy the RAM from somewhere with a good returns policy, get a kit with 2 sticks and not 4 unless you've got quad channel, and just put the RAM in and go. Just return it if something goes sideways. If you're extra worried, you can consult the RAM vendor's page and see if your board is supported.\n\nEdited to add: rereading your comment - don't add to the existing, always replace as the other reply to your comment mentions. It's true - the 'better' stick will sync timings and speed with the 'worse' stick. Also, if using a Ryzen system, 3600MHz will serve you better.",

That is more or less exactly what's going on.\n\nThe tower locates your phone and when your phone answers back, wires such as the mini jack from your computer to the speakers will act as an antenna and receive the signal that gets amplified like it was sound you can hear ( the reason is likely the harmonics)\n\nIt's because yiur speaker wires aren't shielded.",

It's one mitigation technique for the near-far problem (though you can also ramp up power too, which is probably the better way to do it so you don't blast out other adjacent transceivers).\n\nAlso, you still hear these now sometimes on poorly shielded systems because calls will sometimes be initiated in 2G still if higher-order modulation schemes in 3+ aren't available (though I believe this is getting rarer and rarer as 2G cells are starting to become fewer and far between).",

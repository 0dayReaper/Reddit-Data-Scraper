I am currently thinking of mounting an i-5 12600K and a radeon 6950XT, because I can't find a microprocessor equivalent to the i5 in that price range that doesn't bottleneck me in the graphics.\n\nI'm also thinking of replacing the 6950XT with an RTX 4070.\n\nWhat advice or recommendations do you give me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The 2 options that I am studying](https://preview.redd.it/ul0mnjhg7y5b1.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7d25c2fac689e94992f6b641fd4083e9792ce0cf)\n\nThank you very much community.",

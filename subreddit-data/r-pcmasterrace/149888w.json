    "postText": "So 3 days ago, while i was playing TFT, my screen froze. I thought that internet was the problem, tried to alt-tab, nothing. The screen froze at the carousel. Tried ctrl+alt+del and every possible combination but nothing.\n\nTurned the pc off, then on. Everything was okay. I tried playing another game. Freeze again. Restarted and then checked on the event viewer, where there was an error saying \"Bugcheck\". \n\nI searched for the bug and it says that i got blue screened with the VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE. The problem is that, when I'm just browsing, watching a movie etc. everything works fine. No problem at all. \n\nI'm really confused because i don't know if the GPU is dead or is starting to die. Any ideas?",

I am merely offering an explanation.\n\nThe stand goes to a monitor that is priced at $4,999 or $5,999 depending on the screen surface selected. The monitor, despite the price, is an insane value for what it offers and seems to be better than the current $20k-$40k options in that segment for specific use cases.\n\nThe professional users targeted typically order multiple (hundreds or thousands of) units. These clients typically have monitor arms in place to swap out the monitor as needed. As such, monitors sold to this segment typically come without a stand. This Apple display is no different.\n\nHowever, these monitors also typically come with VESA support. Because of the design of this monitor, it instead uses a magnetic mounting mechanism. As such, buyers will either need to buy the magnetic VESA adapter ($199), or the full stand ($999).\n\nIMO, both products are grossly overpriced for what they are. But the monitor itself is an insane value, and the clients who buy the monitor will buy the adapter or stand, as needed, because even the combined cost is still an insane value.\n\nBut that doesn't change the fact that $999 for the stand is absurd. The stand does not offer the full range of movement offered by budget stands from the likes of Dell, and the engineering behind it is a solution to an Apple-created problem.",

The over-engineered and over-priced stand is there if you want it. It's a captive audience, so Apple can get away with the price.\n\nIf \"you're holding it wrong\" didn't chase off customers, this won't either. The mockery going on right now will pass.

It compares more favorably to the similarly priced reference monitors in the 5-6k range but even then it lacks the physical inputs (or outputs) and controls that actual reference monitors have and that the people that purchase those devices use (it does however have a resolution advantage).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it a good monitor? Yea, its what most people would say is extremely high end and/or potential professional use. Its not even remotely going to replace the things they compared it to though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHaving said that, no one actually has an issue with the monitor as far as I can tell. The problem comes entirely because Apple decided to use a proprietary mounting mechanism and did not at least include an industry standard vesa mounting system (which would have cost them literal pennies to just have mounting holes in the back of the damn thing). I honestly believe there would be less of an issue if it at least came with that, if they wanna then push the usefulness of the magnetic mounting system by selling a separate vesa mount that uses it (and of course the stand) then by all means go for it.",

Best way to describe it is the nits isn\u2019t to blow out your eye balls, you need a high nit count to properly create the \u201chigh dynamic range\u201d of color correctly. Basically lots of companies are selling HDR simply because it accepts the signal. Another big issue is they don\u2019t invest in good dimming so the colors get washed. \n\nOnly nvidia has a standard for something to be labeled HDR and it\u2019s akin to hdr10.",

                    "comment": "I don't doubt this. The problem for me is that the stand is not worth anywhere near $1000. The whole point of this display is that it is apparently a professional quality display with specs equivalent to displays worth almost 10 times as much. Great, awesome. But then they go and are selling the stand for WAY more than it is worth. They could likely sell it for $500 and still make a profit from it. It feels like they are sending mixed messages. Are they trying to give great quality products for reasonable prices, or are they trying to rip off their consumers? (I dont doubt that the people buying this product can afford it, but just because you CAN charge more for a product, doesnt mean you SHOULD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: A number of people have pointed out my use of the word \"should\" and how right and wrong are not taken into consideration when setting prices in Capitalism. I should have worded my sentence differently. I was referring to the ability of a company to choose the price of a product, and how if they set it too high, it wont sell well, therefore they SHOULD lower the price. I say this about Apple because even though there will doubtless be a few rich people and large companies which invest in these stands, Apple's sales numbers would doubtless be higher if the price was set lower. This is especially true when you consider the much cheaper alternative that is available (a $200 VESA mount).",

I think the bigger problem is that the Mac Monitor is aimed at such a niche market.  In comparison it goes up against some reference monitors that are truly are $5K however only a handful of people actually need a reference editing monitor.\n\nSo yeah the monitor and especially the stand are a joke but just try and find a similar monitor to it at less than $4k-$5k",

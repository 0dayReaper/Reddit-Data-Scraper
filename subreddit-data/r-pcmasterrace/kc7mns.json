If you love PCs or want to talk about PCs, you can be a part of the community!

I've built more PCs than I can possibly count and if someone expresses no interest in it, that's fine with me.\n\nIt's just how it is in the industries. PC geeks laugh at people who don't build their own PCs meanwhile automotive guys are laughing at the PC guys for not being able to change their own brakes.",

Apparently if you're on an AMD CPU that value helps the game utilize your CPU better.\n\nE: before applying that (and a few other) fix(es), I was getting some truly nasty stuttering and had to turn the resolution down to 1080p with further downscaling with fidelityfx to get it playable and was still having huge frame drops. Now, I can play at 1440 with dynamic downscaling to 1080p as needed (which I'm okay with honestly, I'm not paying as much attention to the pretty graphics when the action gets intense anyway, which is when I'd like better frames too) on high. Unfortunately I now have no idea of my franerate since part of my fix was to disable all overlays and game bars etc, including anything that would readout my fps for me, but it's playable and looks good and that's all I really care about. Feels like a steady 55-60 at minimum; my minimum framerate is so much more stable now.",

They just tracked down where that setting's actual value goes, and every setting in a game is just some hex value underneath it all. \n\nThe accusation being that the game is optimized for Intel CPUs but not AMD. This  is going to be big outrage if it's true, and shit like this happens sometimes, a game deliberately favoring one brand over another on purpose.",

If that's the case, the outrage should be at Intel, not at CDPR.",

Big studios make most of their money by playing it safe, tweaking a mechanic or two to add their own signature on it, and call it a day. RDR2 is a great example of a fantastic open world game that relies on storytelling and solid game mechanics without really pushing the envelope at all.\n\nIndie games pretty much have a completely different set of standards. Usually indie games are either crowd funded or made playable at a fairly early stage (I believe I bought Hades in like Jan or Feb last year) and often are tweaked towards either a particular vision or with backers input on changes. Indie games have a perceived higher chance of hitting it big with new mechanics or a fresh art style because the ones that don't die early due to a lack of interest/funding, whereas ones like Hollow Knight have crowd funding to support the vision. Essentially big companies have significantly more money to lose than to gain, and every so often someone decides they can take a risk that pays out big for them (look at EA as a prime example, with how they finally made Jedi: Fallen Order and how its paying dividends for them vs them just being a Madden/Fifa company, vs all the terrible games they have a reputation of making.)",

The boss fights CAN be challenging when you're younger, and still fun when you're older. Mario RPG is the same way.  The fact is, unfortunately, noone wants to take risks anymore, even nintendo has fallen to shit. They shoehorn some concepts here and there, but I feel like I'll be crucified for saything this... I kinda wish they had kept to thier own IP, and not spread out the digital store. It felt like there was so much more passion on thier platform when every single title was a Nintendo title.",

            "comment": "Well yeah but also no. People have to understand that bad optimization usually shows itself on all levels. Should have seen the guy streaming Watch dogs lagging hard on quad GTX Titan on release, there you have it. Or remember Fallout 76 with hideous 10 year old graphics lagging just as bad on most PCs that were a year or two old, and only somewhat OK on endgame PCs of its time. Or maybe you wanna refresh your memory on how it looked on PS4 back then, 2.5 years ago. That is terrible optimization for you.\n\nIf the game works good for current gen PCs, will work good for current gen Consoles, then you can't blame bad optimization and shouldn't expect devs to pull extra 10 fps for your 7 year old system from their back pocket.\n\nBTW I've just tried launching fallout 76 on my new rig, it is supposed to be good, right? Well, getting 57 FPS in fallout 76 average and in heat of battle had a 27 fps low, here, take a look at the bad optimization.",

The distributors are the ones causing the issue by not addressing the issue of scalping caused by shitty online retail environments that don't take measures to curb mass buying. Why would they? They got paid. The fuck do that care if you or I get one?",

I think since they got wind of the scalping situation and since the rtx is priced low enough to be in a budg3t build they decided to raise the price. \n\nBut raising by $200 is just absurd.",

Anything below MSRP is good.\n\nBut looking back, 1000W plat once can be found sub $100, the $80 1300w evga G2 gold happened  now and then. There were legit sub $50 650-750W Gold PSU all the time. And that was just 2 years ago.\n\nI think Super Flower runs its main factory in mainland China, unless they moved back the manufacturing to Taiwan they are still subjective to the tariffs. Or, fr what I can imagine, is that they import from its Chinese factory then repackage at its Taiwan facility, eventually export to US labeled as Made in Taiwan, which is illegal and will be fined big time once caught but not unheard of in the trade business.",

That was best deal I had personally seen on them ever...it\u2019s the reason I bought it even though I wasn\u2019t in the market for one, the price was just too insanely good to pass up for a good brand platinum. \n\nAn evga 1000w platinum for even less than I paid? I\u2019d have to see it to believe it, because I don\u2019t. I\u2019d definitely believe 130-150 bucks though during a Black Friday/cyber Monday pricing a few years back (I didn\u2019t see that deal though or I would have bought that instead, I use a site called slickdeals and I stay dialed in to sales like an eagle that entire weekend... every single year lookin for every and any pc part deals online, I got some amazing deals on 2TB m.2 drives in previous years too)\n\nIn retrospect, now that prices went up on all PSU even higher, I got an even more amazing deal than I realized at the time. 100 dollars is less than 1/2 of what its worth today for same model.  That psu is still going strong and using it for my evga 3080 ftw3 without any power issues.",

Back in the day it was common if you had a heavy duty rig to also have multiple spinning disks. Unless you had a controller that would do staggered spin-up, the current draw to spin up a number of spinning disks simultaneously was quite large.\n\nSSDs have done more to cut power usage on PCs than anything else to date except for the CRT-LCD transition.",

For reference, a normal desktop DVD-ROM drive is technically half height.  An 8 disk deskside SCSI enclosure did not need more than ~160 W for disk spin up.  \n\nI had such a setup.  Delayed start was just a jumper on the disk (or the backplane if you used SCA disks), and disk would start when the SCSI HBA probed its address.  Kinda cool to hear it turn on, but not really necessary.",

Alongside this, when social distancing is no longer needed in factories supply will increase pushing prices further down.\n\nThe only real long term concern would be the steady increase in silicone chips in various industries which may cause an artificial shortage, everyday objects from fridges to cars are using more and more silicone based chips now we enter the world of IoT but I still think it won\u2019t be a big issue.\n\nMy advice would be to wait out as long as you can, it\u2019s painful but less painful than overpaying on an item that isn\u2019t a necessity and will eventually fall in price.",

So week 1 everyone who wants one bids on that weeks production of say 1000. Early adopters are willing to pay more so each one in that lot goes for $2000.  Each week the price drops as demand is siphoned out of the system.   And in this scenario nvidia is getting the money so they can spend that on factory capacity, overtime, R&amp;D for new products etc.  right now all that extra money is going to scalpers.",

Resources are finite, so increasing the supply just doesn't make sense, but supporting a culture where people take care of what they have could be a great way to handle it. This may be a hot take, but I also feel many companies purposely allow their products to break to increase sales. iPhones with their iOS updates is the first to come to mind.",

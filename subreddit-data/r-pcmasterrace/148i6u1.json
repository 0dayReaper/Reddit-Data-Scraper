They put out exceptional speed and torque but I was wondering if anyone else has a lead on better drivers (preferably wireless) that I can order.\n\nFor reference, I\u2019ve been through the thin dentist pick looking kind which simply aren\u2019t fast or strong enough, and the larger bulkier ones used by mechanics which are strong enough but incredibly slow.",

No reverse switch just turn your hand whichever direction, how much you turn your wrist to the right is how much torque you'll get, can put on low settings and make it crawl",

Pretty sure they're all the from the same Chinese factory with different logos on them. Its a damn good PC tool. I work in IT and got tired of using a ratcheting screw driver when I would have 5+ units to open of and replace parts on. This definitely works well for electronics. I will say that it probably lacks the torque for anything outside of small electronics though. Even some laptop case screws that went heavy on the locktite might be a bit much. Ive had to help the motor by twisting while engaging the motor. But other than that, its usually fine once you get through the heavier duty outside case screws and start working internally.",

Don't know about that specific one you have, but the industrial ones are highly adjustable with torque and have different speed modes.\n\nWe also have some of the pedestrian ones you get on Amazon or at a hardware store.  I'm fond of my Hoto, with some caveats.  It's the larger bits because it wasn't their \"precision\" model, it only has one speed, and it doesn't have a \"manual\" mode (it does not \"lock\" into place so you can hand-turn).  But for computers, that's generally fine.  I'd say it has a *bit* too much torque for the tiny laptop screws (and especially nutserts), so I use a  light hand that allow the driver to twist the button out from under my finger when the screw seats.  No problems with desktops, workstations, servers, or rackmount gear.  I got it because I needed more torque than the little precision ones *for* rackmount gear, desktops, and workstations without paying big-brand money.",

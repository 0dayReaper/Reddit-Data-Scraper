So may as well go for the 7600. \n\nUnless you're doing more CPU intensive tasks other than gaming snd require the extra cores.\n\nAnd while none of us can tell the future the 7600 should be ample for the next 2 years and probably longer even. I mean many are still on like a Ryzen 5600 doing just fine.",

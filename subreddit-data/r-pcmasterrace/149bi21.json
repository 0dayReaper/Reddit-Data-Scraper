            "comment": "So you listed a 500gb storage option and then mentioned wanting to upgrade the RAM.\n\nMemory (RAM) and storage (SSD) or not the same. The storage is for long term holding of data, like the warehouse of a store. While the Memory is the storefront, quicker access but less room available. \n\nBoth Memory and Storage are easy upgradable on most desktop systems. You would likely buy a set of two new RAM sticks to replace the included one, matching RAM is best practice. For storage, you would either buy and replace the current SSD or buy an additional SSD to have two installed. You would also need an extra Sata power and Sata data cable for this.\n\nPlease provide a link to the system as well for more relevant advice in the future. Hope that this helps!",

A few months ago I bought 6700 XT, I got 14 days of warranty (seller was a private person), the GPU was and still is totally fine and I'm very happy with it. I wouldn't buy it without warranty or at least an option to test it for like 30 minutes before paying though.",

AMD AIB partner cards - i.e. Powercolor, XFX, Sapphire (dunno about Asrock but probably them too) don't have a transferable warranty.   So, you better be sure if buying a used AMD card.\n\nI'm not sure how warranty is handled, though - in Finland.",

But you see so many pictures of second hand cards lying around with their backs directly on some surface without protection. I guess that would reduce their life spans somewhat. But should not modern PC parts be designed in a more robust way to cope with ignorant home builders? Not exposing sensitive solder points?",

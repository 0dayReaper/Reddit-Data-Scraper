I barely touched any video games the last few years with school and gym and now summertime work. Maybe I should just hold off another decade or something lol.\n\nOr, maybe a console is what's best fit for someone who can no longer play a lot and just wants to pick something up for an hour or so every few weeks. I fully recognize PCs being superior in pretty much every way, but it's hard to justify a big purchase that I'll get like 100 hours out of at most before I need to upgrade again.",

You will never get the performance per dollar of a console while building a pc (unless you score a crazy deal or something) and consoles are admittedly easier to just pick up a game and play for just a bit every now and again. I'm a pc gamer and don't have many consoles, but they are just the right fit for some people. Buying a 150-300 dollar console to occasionally play some good games for fun might work better than buying a 300 dollar graphics card and having to worry about what games will run at what settings. Especially if you are just getting back into video games or just occasionally need something to do for fun, a console maybe the perfect option.",

Then, we began losing more and more, kept getting outplayed by other players who learned the good tactics.\n\nI stopped playing for a few months, tried to get back into it and I was completely lost. People got too good, too many new things to learn, too little time to play.\nIf you play with random people in your squad, it's game over.\n\nI'm 28 and I haven't touched a multi-player \"competitive\" game in months.",

And if you don't, fuck it, find something else.\n\nWe weren't meant to be on phones and computers 16 hours a day. I mean ever wonder why older generations are less depressed? It's because they don't do so much stuff which has been repeatedly confirmed to cause and enable depression. It's not \"the economy\" or \"boomers\" or any other convenient scapegoat outside of your locus of control, it's your daily habits. \n\nPS using reddit all day counts as this.",

Get out of sleep mode and get into moving around mode by doing some pushups after you wake up.  Even just 5, just to start.\n\n- Stop smoking weed and drinking alcohol every day.  They both make you feel tired.\n\n- Think positively - you can create thought patterns in your head without realizing it, and they can be quite difficult to break out of.  Identify downward thought spirals and break out of them, shout your thoughts down with better thoughts, over time the new thoughts become dominant.",

I really don't 'get' traditional social media. I don't care what anyone else is doing with their lives, I'm living my own, tell me about it when you see me.\n\n'Stories' and temporary media I think are the biggest problem now. Now the things you upload just disappear in a day, what was the point in uploading it? If it wasn't good enough to share permanently with the world, why did you waste your time on it? It's gone and now you feel like you need to make another to fill that gap. Social media needs you chasing that validation, and that attention. The quicker it runs out, the sooner you'll be back on their platform looking at ads.\n\nThe only time I've used social media was to create an instagram camera filter I thought was funny, and 25k people used it. It made me really happy, and only took me a day to learn and create.\n\nI play plenty of games don't get me wrong, but I prefer to play something with a journey, an outcome, a meaning. Single player games take me on those journeys, but many of my friends grind away at multiplayer games and feel  empty. I think the psychology of money-making in multiplayer games has outgrown the actual fun you have playing them.  The developer wants you to grind away, and by the end of the day you feel like you achieved nothing. Battle royales too, you're always chasing that win, but if you don't get it you feel unfulfilled.\n\nThe type of game you play becomes important from this point of view, and needs to be varied. There's so much to see and do on a computer, it's worth every penny I spent on it.  Just be careful of the predatory companies that abuse your mind and try to trap you in a happiness goose chase.",

Almost like you're still stuck in the routine.\n\nBut if you get comfortable and sit down with one of the new games you bought to make the most of your PC it'll make you feel so much better. Getting sucked into a new game is a feeling which I lost for a while that I've just recently rediscovered and it reminded me why I love gaming as a hobby.\n\nIf you're having trouble starting, maybe plug your PC into your TV and play with a controller, or lean back in your desk chair if you can't do that. Sometimes the KB+M and uptight posture can be a bit.. intimidating when you're feeling low on energy.\n\nI know I'm late to this post, but if this comment is read by one person and it helps them relax I'll consider it time well spent.",

My wording might have been better. I was referring to usb 3.2 (formerly known as 3.1 gen 2) vs TB3. Not TB3 vs nothing.\n\nEvery use case mentioned is one both TB3 and USB 3.2, with the exception of eGPU.\n\nIs there a benefit to use the more expensive and less ubiquitous TB3 over the less expensive and more prevelant USB 3.1 (10gbps) or 3.2 (20gbps) for the average consumer",

When I work from home I plug in my laptop using just one cable, a thunderbolt usb C, and it keeps my laptop powered while connecting to all those accessories without an unholy octopus of leads plugged into my laptop. The dock with all those things is hidden away and it gives me way more desk space and looks better. Also transferring large files from external storage is amazing with thunderbolt.",

But it's not a deal breaker for me (I've used 3 laptops in the past 3 years that didn't have USB A ports), and worst case scenario I have a 4 year old Type C hub that covers all my bases for usb, ethernet, charging, and hdmi. This is only a problem for people who still haven't yet accepted USB C as the new standard.",

And since it\u2019s thunderbolt 3, instead of being limited to what you get, you can literally connect like 10-15 different things to a MacBook Air, which only has 2 ports. If you just had a hdmi, 2 usb, and a charging port, that\u2019s what you get and you can\u2019t really change it. But with tb3, you can connect a dock and have your display, external drive, mouse and keyboard, sd card, phone, and charger all on just 2 ports",

    "postText": "Zotac trinity (non OC version) is by far the cheapest available in my country. Other cards like msi, gigabyte gaming, asus tuf etc. tend to cost at least 50 - 100 eur more than the zotac one. I checked some reviews and apparently zotac trinity 4070ti has some problems with cooling compared to other options, however it still doesnt seem to heat up more than 65 - 70c in most scenarios. Is it worth paying extra for the card with better cooling solution? Or can I save money on this given that im buying a case with pretty good airflow (Corsair 4000D Airflow)?",

Thats why Im here",

Those charts are meaningless.  \nAt 9:30, he rates the Colorful waterblock as the best, without testing anything, which is bunk, because there are plenty of air coolers that outperform water.... you cannot know without evaluating.  \nAnd I'm done with him, I feel like his video is making me dumber.  \n\nI would not use this one idiot to weigh any of your decisions.  \n\nSorry, that doesn't make it any easier.  \n\nA brief googling doesn't reveal a real good review of that specific zotac trinity.",

Don't know who this guy is but he actually has hands on.  \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Qx42KNg\n\n^Consider OTech rated the MSI higher. But person with actual hands on found the MSI reached 77C! and the Zotac only hit 69C (nice!).  \n\nSo contrary to Otech, the zotac is lookin better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgt_DNdAtfA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY34Np1EVFw",

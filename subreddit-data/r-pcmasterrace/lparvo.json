Or that heating and cooling cycles are bad for your components. Nevermind the fact that your components already vary in temperature during regular use, they run hotter if you do anything intensive and then cool down once you stop doing that intensive task. Pc components are so small that thermal expansion is not something that anyone would need to be thinking about. \n\nOne simple reason why I will always shut down my computer at the end of the day is that I don't want to waste energy since I pay my own bills.",

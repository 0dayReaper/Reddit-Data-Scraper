Both of them met each other fairly often via the guy friend hanging out on weekends at our place. \n\nSo along comes puberty and girl gets a crush on the guy friend. Guy friend knows I have a crush on the girl. But the girl is super persistent. She asks to hang out with him and convinces her mom to drive her into the city to hang out at his place while her mom does some errands in town. Mind you I think my friend and I were in... 9th grade and she was in 8th. So lol to start with.\n\nShe gets over there and sits on his couch in his room while he is playing EverQuest. She's like \"come on, come get on the couch with me\" and he just keeps ignoring her. Finally she crawls up in his lap and starts to straddle him and he just looks around her body and says \"can you get off, I'm trying to get an item for my epic\".\n\nShe went and sat on the couch after till her mom picked her up.\n\nI heard the story, amazingly coherent, from both of them. I asked my guy friend why he didn't do anything and he was like \"you obviously have a crush on her, also she's annoying\". She was like \"I don't understand at all! Why invite me over if you're just going to play computer games!\"\n\nA similar scenario happened with another guy friend and her... she basically got ignored. I think it fucked with her confidence a bit too cause she definitely got mixed messages from them.\n\nAnyway yea. This reminded me of that.",

Here goes.\n\nIf the obvious talking about it doesn't work. Setting up scheduled times for him to have free time or a scheduled time for together time - Whichever is best presented/worded.\n\n if that doesn't work.\n\nThen you can try similar tactics. Create a hobby that you enjoy yourself, and either, you become engrossed in it and you priotize it over him and he will notice.\nOr you have just created yourself a new hobby and you are both happy with your new-found situation.\n\nBut if you don't want to create a new hobby, showing him what he is missing/jealously over you prefering to do something else might sway him. It might seem childish? But if talking / scheduled time doesn't work. This might.\n\nOr you can try gamification to fix it, create a game out of it in some way. I would suggest googling examples of it. There is an app called the same thing, ignore that and look at examples of what gamification means.\n\nOr you can do the general thing that r/relationship advices. And that is to breakup. Buuut that should be a last resort I reckon lol.\n\nSorry if this was unwarranted ^  saw your post and thought about how to fix it.",

She was interested but didn't outright say anything, I wasn't interested in her back this was a way to more gently let her down I suppose.\n\nEventually she took the hint, but some days or week later brought her gay guy friend and asked if I was into guys and wanted to get to know him. After I let her know I was not into guys that quickly ended the awkward moment and I don't think I ever saw her again.",

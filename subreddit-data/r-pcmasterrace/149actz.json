Add packing material inside the computer to prevent the GPU from moving but be gentle to not damage fans. If there is glass, something to cushion it like foam or bubble wrap or a towel.\n\nMonitor: It depends on your transport vehicle but I usually give screens each their own passenger seat. A layer of bubble wrap over the screen then a layer of cardboard will protect it well.",

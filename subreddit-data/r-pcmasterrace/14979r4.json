I'm having trouble deciding on a cooler for it, though. The board is a Z790 Aorus Elite AX, and the shield covering the rear of the IO shield doesn't seem to allow for much space. My old block air cooler won't fit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any recommendations on cooler? Should I spring for a liquid system and overclock? I don't think I'd need to OC, given that my 2070 RTX will be my bottleneck now.\n\n https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/147nl3a/daily_simple_questions_thread_june_12_2023/jnxz0a0/\n\n----\n\n&gt; Crystal disk mark used to show Current Pending Sector Count error for my HDD.

For all we know, that could be a core i5-680, which is a 13 year old quad-core CPU. LOL It also makes me distrust that the system is actually using DDR4 RAM.\n\nThey're lying through their teeth saying that system can play games like Hogwarts at 60fps. \n\nIt'll probably handle games like Apex Legends, valorant, easier e-sports titles, CS:GO, maybe ultra-low quality Fortnite, minecraft. Don't expect much from this at all, but for $320 for a working computer that is already built, what more can you really expect.\n\nAlso, Dell's only problem w/ Reputation is their use of proprietary hardware in their PC's, like power supplies or motherboards, making upgrading them difficult or impossible. As far as QUALITY goes, Dell is one of the largest computer and enterprise technology corporations in the world, not the best choice for home users, but the majority of Fortune 1000 companies run their most critical systems and data on Dell.",

The CPU is fine, motherboard is ultra-base model but still a good brand quality, the CPU cooler is garbage, GPU is solid, but it's an $850 USD GPU here. RAM is fine (CL16 would be nicer, but it's fine), NVMe is garbage compared to what is available, it's too small and too slow, for that money it should be Gen4 at least 1TB capable of over 5000MB/s reads and writes, PSU is actually pretty OK, you won't be running a 4080 or 4090 / 13900K/7950X with it, but it's fine. Case is solid, decent airflow assuming enough fans. \n\nHere's roughly that same system without windows (add $30 for builder license). about $1530 USD https://pcpartpicker.com/list/GfsTXy",

The former is about fifty bucks cheaper, but not looking to upgrade for a while. Additionally, pcparts picker mentioned a required BIOS update to work w my motherboard. How difficult is that?

If you do any gaming whatsoever, the 7700X completely tanks the 3900X. \n\nI'm confused what you're doing though. You said you have the option of using the 7700X OR the 3900X and, and a BIOS update for our motherboard?  Something is wrong dude. The 3900X is an AM4 CPU, while the 7700X is an AM5 CPU. The 3900X AM4 CPU requires a B350/B450/B550 or X370/X470/X570 (and technically also A320) chipset motherboard, while the 7700X AM5 CPU requires a B650/B650E or X670/X670E chipset motherboard. \n\nAre you sure that you're not comparing an AMD 3900X to an AMD 5700X???? a 5700X is an AM4 CPU that will work in existing AM4 motherboards.",

I'd never let a corsair hub or fan controller to control the CPU cooling fan, you want the CPU cooling fan connected to the CPU_Fan header, some motherboards won't even allow the system to boot if it detects no fan on the CPU_Fan header.",

I\u2019m not trying to have the hub control the fan speed, I just don\u2019t have a way to use the RGB on the thermal fan because I don\u2019t have an ARGB slot (on MB nor hub).\n\nSo I was thinking of just getting another Corsair fan (still connected to the CPU_FAN header) but would be able to actually use/control the RGB. \n\nSorry that wasn\u2019t clear.",

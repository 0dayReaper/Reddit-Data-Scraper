    "postText": "I don't know why but, seeing my parts reach 70C and up scares me\n\nIn most of the games I play, the Temps, both for CPU and GPU rarely, and i mean RARELY, reach 60C, I've like, tweaked the settings in every of my games to make sure they don't reach hot tempts but also don't drop bellow 60\n\nBut there's games like Elden Ring, Dark souls 3, minecraft with shaders, emulated games, where the Temps reach 60+ very quickly \n\nNow yes, I know those aren't bad Temps, and iirc, as long as my parts don't get past 80+ during load, I shouldn't worry\n\nBut here's the thing, we're in June, over here the hottest part of the year is usually late July to early August, the summer dog days or whatever \n\nAnd according to Heaven Benchmark, my GPU reaches 80C at 100% util, and it will get hotter in one and a half months, and my CPU is probably gonna get that hot too during that time\n\nAnd let's not forget about the fact that when I see my components reach 65/70+ all I'm thinking is my components getting damaged, and their lifespan getting lowered more and more\n\nWhich in turn makes me uncomfortable and make me not want to play the game\n\nAnd yes my case has good airflow, and im trying to keep the dust at bay, as much as i can",

I had a cpu (laptop) reach 101c while gaming, but never reached it's thermal limit, so never thermal throttled, never reduced performance, and never crashed.",

The only time it's bad for the lifespan, is when it overheats, but if your parts are working correctly, it'll never overheat because of thermal throttling. If you ever thermal throttle, then I would look into trying to lower it. But if you never do, then you're not at a temperature that your parts can't handle.",

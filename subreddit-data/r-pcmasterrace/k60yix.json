We typically have to work two weeks and then get our paycheck 1 week later.  There's a huge gap in time between the effort we put in and the reward.\n\nCompare this to addictive activities such as smoking nicotine.  You put the cigarette to your mouth, inhale the smoke, and it quickly hits your brain.  Very little time passes from the act of putting the cigarette to your mouth to the reward of the nicotine hitting your brain.  Even for people who are trying to eliminate cravings with patches or gum still have that desire to put something in their mouth because their brain associates that with a reward.\n\nGaming sort of falls in between the two examples above.  I'm currently playing World of Warcraft and I'd love to upgrade my weapon.  There's a chance of a weapon upgrade dropping in a dungeon so if I run that dungeon enough times, I'll get the weapon and improve my character.  The effort I expend in running dungeons over and over again will probably pay off for me by the end of the day.",

The second I heard everything, us getting hit, and with the adrenaline reaction time shot up I started to look for the enemy lol. I and the family were confused to how I witnessed the main car that caused everything continue on to hit a pole in the middle lane across the street. It wasn't until I realized I had been playing overwatch ferociously at the time. *It's high noonnn*\n\nI've been thinking about this quite a bit, how slow the older generation reactions are in general compared to people who play fast games.",

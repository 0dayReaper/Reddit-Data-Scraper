    "postText": "I'm getting a new GPU and I just replaced my PSU to accommodate. I'm going from an RTX 2060, to a Rog Strix 3080. I've seen mixed opinions on if I should just plug it in and download the latest drivers and others saying to use DDU and wipe everything before putting in the new card. Just looking for some opinions as I'm still new to some of this.",

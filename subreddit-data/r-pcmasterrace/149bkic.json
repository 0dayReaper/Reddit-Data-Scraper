Aliexpress my mate got drunk and ordered 3060 early morning because it was \u00a360 cheaper then buying with next day delivery in UK. \n\nSure it arrived but he claims it\u2019s not performing as well as reviews show 3060 in similar games. I think he got scammed but he doesn\u2019t want to admit it.",

I\u2019m not thinking Aliexpress, but Alibaba since the latter seems to be geared more towards bulk purchases more suited for distributors instead of consumers. \n\nMy reasoning being that the GPUs there have most likely been used for non stop mining until that phased out. At $57 for a 2080ti I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll risk taking the loss if it is not functioning or genuine. \n\nTrying to make budget builds for my buddies and spread the PC love.",

AliExpress is owned by Alibaba so it will provide relevant information. If you really need a GPU on the cheap, Ebay or FB Marketplace are much better options.\n\nHope that this helps and good luck!",

Made [this](https://youtu.be/xTAzwKiQ7Ns) build about a year ago with a spare 1080ti and it worked wonders, but I recently found that a Dell T3600 sports a more powerful CPU as well as up to 825w power supply for a similar cost as a z420. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m using a T3600 with a 3070ti and I\u2019m very satisfied for casual gaming with buds (not super obsessed with fps or playing any recent AAA titles). Also, I\u2019m wondering if AliExpress and Alibaba might be different in the kind of product they offer, because at $57 USD for a 2080ti my aim would be to put together some builds for my buddies that can\u2019t afford to spend over a grand for a PC they will use maybe once a week if time allows. \n\nThank you for your thoughtful answer.",

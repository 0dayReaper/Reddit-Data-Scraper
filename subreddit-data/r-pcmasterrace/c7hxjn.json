The pro and onex both did a few 4k games @ 60fps. Just like tradition, they will make a few games that hit all their advertisements. Just none of it will be in the same game.\n\nThen, like usual, devs will focus more on what gamer demand wants. Which is going to be the highest fidelity  they can reach @ 30 fps for most games. Because most gamers care more about the game being more beautiful than they care about that 60 FPS. For example, we will likely see 8k minecraft, CoD GenericWarfare 4k 60 fps and Forza Motorsports 1080p 120 fps. But we are not going to see 8k 120 fps, something they never claimed mind you (guy stated we will see things like 8k and 120 fps, not implying that they will be at the same time)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the 4k 30 FPS, Games like tomb raider are going to end up at the higher fidelity and not care as much about the frame rates, because that's what is going to sell those games. Pumping up the settings and looking gorgeous will sale more copies.",

I don't disagree - consoles make sense for casual gamers who don't play more than a few hours a week, or for parents buying toys for their kids.\n\nBut you can't build a PC that's equivalent to a One X for the same price. You can get within a few hundred bucks, but not the same price. Unless you're willing to spend a long time looking for deals, and to buy used, perhaps.",

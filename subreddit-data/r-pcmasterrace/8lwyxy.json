            "comment": "We would like to extend our condolences to TotalBiscuit's loved ones. Much more than an influence to PC Gaming, John Bain was a human being, and his absence will be felt by those who were closest to him.\n\nLosing a loved one is never easy, but losing a loved one before their time is one of the greatest pains a human being can feel.\n\nCancer, especially, makes us feel desperate and helpless.\n\nIf you'd like to perhaps extend a hand of support to those suffering with such an affliction, consider donating to a charity (Genna Bain, John's wife has suggested [Bowel Cancer UK](https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/)) or supporting a distributed computing project such as [folding@home](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/8c09id/use_your_pc_to_help_scientists_beat_cancer_and/).\n\nWe ask that you remain civil in commenting on this thread.",

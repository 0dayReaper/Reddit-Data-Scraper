    "postText": "Been at a job for a year and a half job requires me to travel all over the US and i do some over seas work mostly Mexico. Id like to be able to play some games offline like Monster Hunter, Borderlands, AOE2, etc. I\u2019m looking for suggestions for what would be easy to travel with but would probably never leave the hotel room once there. \n\nChecking an extra bag wouldn\u2019t be bad not that i want to trust an airline with a pc as I\u2019m sure there are some stories of person gets to place bags aren\u2019t there person doesn\u2019t get bag for a few days. \n\nI\u2019ve built a regular full size pc before so building a small pc doesn\u2019t scare me to much but im happy to take suggestions for companies that build pcs. \n\nIm open to using a laptop as long as i cant burn down the hotel with it as the last time i had one the thermals weren\u2019t very good. \n\nBudget wise if anyone is curious id like to aim for something in the 2k range. \nIf anyone puts a build together id like to get at least a 4070 without having to \u201ccheap\u201d on other parts. \n\nAny ideas or thoughts on the topic are welcomed only thing that im taking off the table is a steam deck, switch, other console. Only reason for this is cause id like to use this for paper work as well.",

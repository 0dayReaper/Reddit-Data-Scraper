    "postText": "Hello. \n\nI currently use a 27\", 1080P, 144Hz monitor but I'm considering switching to a 2560x1080 Ultrawide. Is it worth it? I know there are quite a few games that support it really well, though there are plenty that don't. I also understand that some games support it but cutscenes are still 16:9.\n\nWhat's your experience with UW? Is it worth it?\n\nI have a 5700X, 5700 XT and 16GB DDR4. Hence why I'm not going with 3440x1440.",

IF you really want to go wide with propper ppi values 34\" 3440x1440 is the starting point. \n\nBecause your limitation on the gpu side i understand that 3440x1440 is no enjoyable (re)solution (now thats a intended pun) but most people I know have their monitors at least for 2 to 4 gpu\u00b4s. When I started wqhd the gtx680 2gb wasn\u00b4t fun, sli\u00b4in it later did not help much, 980ti was a different beast and a gamechanger",

I'd go with a normal 2560x1440 monitor and use a custom resolution for an ultrawide experience.  2560x1440 is only 5% more diagonal than 2560x1080, so for example a 32\" 16:9 with black bars is equivalent to a 30\" ultrawide.  And it'd be SO much better for non-gaming tasks.",

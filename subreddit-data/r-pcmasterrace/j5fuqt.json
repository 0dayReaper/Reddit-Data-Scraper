Software setups and testing are usually included as part of the 5USD service, although most people don't want to wait a few days for benchmarks. \n\nThat being said, one year of support goes for over 100, but the real difference are parts. For instance an Asus GEFORCE RTX 2080TI 11G gaming, goes for 2,050 USD. So $1k for \"parts\" is.... I mean you could get a case and a few ram sticks I think, probably.",

Lot of time investment, plus having to learn how to do it, have the tools, and not fuck it up and brick something.

Often enough to enjoy it, rarely enough that I've always had minor issues (mostly case and cooling related) because I don't know if I ever got \"good at\" building them. \n\nI'm a grown ass adult with a grown ass adult job. I decided the $200 difference was worth trying prebuilt for the first time.\n\nMan, being able to just press the power button and have everything work perfectly the first time made it completely worth it. I absolutely love this computer, and I'm not an Alienware shill. You're right that companies don't charge much above parts cost these days, but I think part of the defense of builders is you want the work to feel *worth* something when building a computer, above the sense of accomplishment you get with it being a hobby.",

                            "comment": "I've been working on or building PCs for 15 years and noticed that too many people get caught up in hype, suggesting to others things that they wish they had done but have no real interactions with. \n\n\nThis isn't meant to brag, but to help you pick who to listen to. Check where your friends are getting their info, because a lot of people will suggest things solely based of off what they've heard online. \n\nIf you want an experienced opinion from someone in the field, not based on online research or opinions, I'd be happy to suggest a build with the budget you have.\n\nIf you feel like reading a couple broader suggestions:\n\n1. No water cooling unless you are doing more than your processor can handle and need to overclock, but this is only applicable if you are already running a really nice processor. Overclocking is inherently risky and it's better long term to just get the better processor first time around if possible. Your processor DOES come with a cooler that is sufficient for it, that's logical. (Water cooling or aftermarket coolers are acceptable cosmetically, but it's rarely actually necessary)\n\n2. Balance your build, like don't put an i7 with a GTX 1050. That's just a lot of wasted processor. Bragging rights is one thing, but from an actual performance standpoint 90% of people don't need more than an i5 or Ryzen 5, coupled with 16gb of RAM, an SSD, and something around the GTX 1070 or RTX 2060 range to play the game they are actually playing. However, if you want to doa bit of \"future proofing\" and put in something from the 7 series, a nicer card, and 32gb of RAM then go for it, but know that it's not necessary and will be putting age on parts before they're truly useful. (Online numbers posted might be accurate, but actual performance and tangible performance are different. It doesn't matter that your car can do 200mph if you only take to to grocery store and rarely break 50mph)\n\n3. Quality matters but \"bells and whistles\" are just that. No need to spend $200 on a motherboard with the $90 version has everything you actually use. If you want built-in wi-fi, make sure it's because you don't have space for a pci-e card or it's just harder/impossible to replace the on-board. RGB doesn't make things faster. The power buttons on the board are only nice for the techs who work on them. As long as they're from the same generation, that NVME slot on the $200 board is probably the same as the one on the $90 board.\n\n4. SSDs are all magical, but they're not all equal. Please make sure you use an NVME over a mSATA or SATA SSD, they're 2-15x better, and yes the Samsung EVO PRO PLUS does perform that much better than the WD Blue, but you might not push it hard enough to notice.\n\n5. SSDs are great for speed, but crap for stability. Although they are less likely to fail, they rarely give warnings when they do. So make sure you have a 2nd HDD for storage and a USB drive for things that are truly irreplaceable. \"Anything worth having is worth having in 2 places.\"\n\nThat's all I can thing of right now, hope it's not more confusing than helpful.",

Voids the warranty of course, but typically you'd be upgrading after its expired anyway.\n\nThe real issue is the quality of parts in a prebuilt tends to be.. Errm.. Lesser. You'd get a cheapo Chinese psu, a flashy but flimsy cheap case with poor air flow and just the cheapest components available with huge price hikes for more RAM/better GPU etc.\n\nThe $90 price difference would be if they'd used good quality, high reliability parts - they cut an extra 50-100 on a typical build buy going cheaper though.\n\nThis is of course a generalisation; you'll get some places which make sure they don't have to worry about pissed customers by just using the better parts. I'm planning to start a custom building business, providing for my locals just from home - I'll be doing the \"make sure I don't have to fuck around and deal with warranty returns as much as possible\" plan, and just lose out on a potential extra \u00a340 per build.

            "comment": "It doesnt even really hold up either, at least not in the UK. When it came time for my last upgrade I decided to look up a complete build just to see what ballpark figure it would be.\n\nI 'created' a PC on Overclockers from the 9th gen \"Coffee lake\" intel base. Seemed high end and also well received. I swapped everything around to how I wanted it and with what would work and the total was \\~\u00a31200.\n\nI then took the exact same list and one by one searched for them online. The combined total obviously varies, but was \\~\u00a31000-1100ish.\n\nOkay so, cheaper? No. The shipping of my PC on OCUK was \u00a312. The combined shipping on these parts was \\~\u00a380+. Plus other fees. If I wanted to only use reputable sellers like Amazon or something, it was even more expensive, not cheaper, than a pre built.\n\nAlso consider a lot of these parts came from OC themselves and it made even less sense. \n\nTheir builder only lists compatible parts and will tell you that two parts are not compatible. You cannot make a mistake. They build it for you so, you are guaranteed to have it all work together.\n\nWhen you build yourself, you *can* use PC partpicker. But there isnt any guarantee that the info is right, or will be there. Like, will the 3080 fit X case? No one knows until someone tries. So the compatibility isnt confirmed all the time. If you are shooting for the hot new part, you cant be 100% sure its fully compatible until you are actively sticking it together.\n\nNothing stings more than the pain of getting into the build and realising something doesnt fit, or something broke. Pre builts have a peace of mind to them.\n\nTheir builds are also great. They come super neat and the cable management its great. I know its \"not hard to do it yourself\" or its \"not that bad.\" However, its time consuming. Frustrating. And you *can* fuck up no matter your experience with it. I know full well that their build will be neater than my own, for sure. \n\nAnd for all of that peace of mind, im paying what? \u00a350 more? Who the fuck cares?\n\n\"But wait, you can get all those parts on sale, then it will be cheaper\" SO? They can also hold sales, or have discounts and coupons too. And the difference is one I can have now, one I have to slowly build over a year or two. Think of all the poor fucks doing that when the 3080 got announced and made that 2080 suddenly a mistake.\n\nIts just easy, can be done in a day. And isnt more expensive in any noticeable amount. Pre-builts are fine. At least in the UK. People need to get off their high horses.",

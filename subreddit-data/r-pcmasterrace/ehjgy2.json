I wouldn't be able to download 32GB in less than a minute.\n\nBut the more info link really solved the question! You don't have to download 'full 32gb', because you're downloading 'empty 32gb' which can be used as ram. And these empty, unwritten 32gb need just a few megabytes to act as a container!\n\nI'm bad at explaining, just visit the more info link, it's explained way better than I can.",

I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that the technology was miniaturized since then. \n\nEven in the 4 years between ANH and ROTJ, the technology was improved enough to where the targeting laser was accurate enough to target capital ships and destroy them, which are significantly smaller targets. \n\nI know that change has little to do with miniaturization, but given Palpatines resources (even after his death, when his Sith cultists kept his spirit alive and brought his body to Exogol, I'm sure he began plotting and building his resources right away) I'm sure it's achievable within that time given what they could do with just 4 years under the Empire.",

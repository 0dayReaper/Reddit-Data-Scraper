Disconnect all drives other than E, then boot from the installation media. On the drive selection screen delete all listed partitions and then just click next.\n\nBut yes for win 10 UEFI is recommended (but not required), for 11 UEFI is required.",

This would enable you to accidentally delete the wrong partition(s) resulting in irrecoverable data loss of is then used to install windows on.\n2. Windows setup has a bad habit of placing boot record partition and system partitions on any drive other than the one windows is being installed on. Especially in systems with a HDD+SSD systems.",

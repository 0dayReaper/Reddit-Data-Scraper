Finally hitting that elusive framrate only for some pos optimized game to come in at 27fps on low settings and refusing to let it beat you? Offload here.",

I'm capping my monitor in most games, and those that are not are very close to it.\n\nBut to be honest the only reason i bought a 4090 is because i already had a 3090, so getting a 7900xtx or a 4080 didn't make much sense, and i also like thinkering with A.I, so i needed a big amount of fast VRAM.",

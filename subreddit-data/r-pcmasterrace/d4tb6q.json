Unfortunately it's mostly a tactics game, so I'm pretty sure the open world is gone, but the combat and skills have been balanced really well to compensate. \n\nThe biggest change to the flow is that you control your party as a whole team, and then pass turn to the opponent, so you can choose each round in what order you want your troops/heroes to move.",

I enjoyed that vacation more than anything.  No stress of having to plan a trip, deal with airport security, renting a car, nothing.\n\nI love to travel and do so annually, that was a bonus vacation.

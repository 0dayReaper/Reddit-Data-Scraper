    "postText": "So I built my first PC 8 months ago and ever since I've had this red light on my GPU, it glows even when the PC is shut down. I always thought it was normal, but I looked it up and apparently it means that it isn't getting enough power? I don't understand because my GPU seems to run on its full potential, I haven't experienced anything bad. Is there anything to fix? If yes, how do I fix it?\n\nGPU: RTX 3060Ti\n\nPSU: EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G6 750 W 80+ Gold",

Also curious if it is a power limit light as you stated and it won't reset once triggered without a full power cycle?\n\nLast guess is that it's always on when using a power adapter instead of a native 12vhpwr cable, possibly related to the sensor pins on the native cable",

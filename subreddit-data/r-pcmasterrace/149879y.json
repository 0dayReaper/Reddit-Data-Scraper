    "postText": "When I use Kombuster, the GPU goes to 99 percent usage. But in games in for example in Rocket league it's only 84-87 percent. The really weird thing. When I use Kombuster and have 99 pecent load. No coil whine at all. But in Rocket League there is an insane amount of Coil Whine. Except if I lower the framerate cap, then it's also gone. SHould I get a new card to avoid this really bad coil whine? Also how can I get games to be 99 percent of GPU usage, just as Kombuster does? Thanks for any help I can get. Have a great day!\n\nEdit: In Diablo 4 the GPU is using from 92-96 percent. Also with coil whine, but not as bad as Rocket League.",

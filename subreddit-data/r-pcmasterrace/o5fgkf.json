It's not an improvement, it's just going to confuse people.\n\n2, don't make advertisements a part of the operating system.

They also need to use DX anyway to publish on Xbox.",

Only after all that would I approve the heavily edited update list for rollout to the company's desktops. Even then, only a certain percentage of the systems would initially get the new updates for a period of time until enough people had used the computers and found bugs, incompatibilities, etc. After more troubleshooting, testing, partial rollouts, repeat, repeat, would the rest of the desktops get the updates. Windows Server updates were a whole other thing. Had probably 15 or more VM's just for update testing. Felt like we should have had a separate department just for dealing with MS updates. Glad I don't have to deal with that any more.",

Or at least automated dark mode etc and try to do something like Mac did, have a new faster code which can run C based apps using translation. Windows 11 if the leaks are right,doesn't seem that big of a deal cause it only changes UI",

Some settings can only be done in the control panel, some only in the settings app. It's not even consistent how it's separated. There's even submenus inside the settings app that will then bring you to the control panel or other old windows UIs. It's inconsistent, it's confusing, it's both outdated and modernized at the wrong aspects. \nI have no idea how Microsoft didn't manage to fix this after all those years..",

But before I myself ever built s desktop pc I had a gaming laptop, and eventually the thermals got so bad me and my dad decided to clean it out and reapply thermal paste based on online recommendations. It was kind of scary and we did it without my brothers help, but it worked perfectly and I got really good results. Confidence boosted and I realised that some problems you really can fix for yourself!\n\nFast forward a month and my dad gets me an antivirus program on disk, and while installing it I somehow misplaced the CD. I was so sure I had put it in the disk tray but it was just gone, family laughed at me and said surely I had just forgotten where I put like I usually do and then we all just forgot about it. But shortly thereafter my performance started dropping drastically until eventually it would just shut down under any load and was basically broken. And we had to turn it in to a repair shop. When we came to pick it up they let us know it was the strangest issue the repair guys had ever seen. We open up the package and with the computer came a LEGO Harry Potter disk we had forgotten to take out, oops. And guess what, the antivirus disk as well. After some initial confusion as to how there could have been 2 CDs in the computer we connected the dots and started laughing our asses off.",

I even pulled it apart and repasted with good thermal paste, but that didn't seem to help at all.  Seems the CPU just blows up to high temps, and the cooling solution isn't adequate to keep up.  A cooling pad underneath doesn't seem to affect it at all.\n\nEdit: also for the record I haven't done extensive temp monitoring in a while, but I don't think it actually gets above 90C, it's just that it thermal throttles at a relatively low temperature, and there is no way for me to adjust temp settings in this particular BIOS or anywhere else.",

I regularly dust and clean out the vents, alcohol wipes for the outsides, and haven\u2019t even changed from the stock Thermal Paste yet. Still runs like an absolute dream. I have mine sitting on a Laptop Board with an X-Stand to elevate the fans off the ground a bit. \n\nThey do run hotter than your normal Desktop, but I like the option of moving around to my couch/my bed/living room/etc. The portability is nice when you have friends who don\u2019t PC Game, since I can just take the laptop and an HDMI cord over to Game with them.",

What's the practical difference between 50 and 60 deg temps? What's the practical difference between 144 fps and 150 fps? Marginal gains.\n\nThere is an argument to be made that marginal gains add up. If you lower your temp floor you can increase your overclock, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm also a road cyclist and there's this constant spending on lighter, fancier, more aero parts that save you 1-2 watts each and/or weigh 50 grams less. The practical solution is to simply build strength and drop weight yourself, your bike isn't the limiting factor. It's all just flexing to keep up with one another, but we all do it.\n\nPlus it's always fun to nerd out about something and try to eke out maximal performance given a set of constraints.",

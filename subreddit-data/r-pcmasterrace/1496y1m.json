    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI've just built a new PC with a RTX 4090 Suprim X.\n\nJust to make sure everything worked fine, I run some tests using OCCT. All of them went perfectly, except for the 3D Standard test.\n\nThe first time I run this test, as soon as it started (literally at 00:00:06), 5621 errors were detected. This sounded really strange to me, because the graphics card works flawlessly in game and it came from a previous build were it worked as well.\n\nThe first thing I did after this result was testing it again and this time I got 0 errors.\n\nShould I be worried? What could have caused all those errors?\n\nThanks in advance \u263a\ufe0f",

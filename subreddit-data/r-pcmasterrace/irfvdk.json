I guess if you find it comfortable then my bad, do what you want, just take care of your back. \n\nAnother edit: I have taken out the bit about sim racing and replaced it with car enthusiasts. I know they aren't best suited for sim rigs (height, and too much movement).",

Real leather has much mroe physical resistance to it, and you should be able to feel it. It's usually not as glossy either, it doesn't shine like plastic does. If you want a proper leather chair, look for a second-hand one made ideally before the mid-2000's.",

You HAVE TO see it running in person, playing a game, doing a bit of random work and applications. It could easily be that some stuff is fried on the mobo or the gpu etc.\n\nAlso Ram capacity doesn't mean actual installed ram. It just means max support (4x32gb is possible, but could be there's only 16gb in it). Either way, that's not a deal breaker as Ram is super cheap these days.\n\nBiggest concern is if the dead PSU also took down things in the mobo or gpu with it as it went.\n\nBut tbh if you can find a fair deal on a used pc with similar spec cpu and worse gpu that actually worksfor around 2-300 bucks, then you could get a 3060Ti or 4060Ti new and total it wouldn't be much more than 50-100 bucks above what you are paying for this used pc and a new psu on top (those aren't cheap these days).\n\nA 3060Ti /4060Ti will offer equal/better performance than the 2080 Super, while doing so at half the wattage, so you'd probably earn back the 50 bucks difference in a year or two just from power saving alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Try to scout for a similar used build with a budget GPU instead (but one that actually has a working PSU), and then find a cheaper modern gpu to replace it with.\n\nThis listed PC with bricked PSU: 300-400 bucks + new PSU = 500-550 bucks\n\nAnother used PC with worse gpu: 200-300 bucks + new GPU = 600-650 bucks",

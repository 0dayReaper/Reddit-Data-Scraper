I agree with that you should eat before the dogs eat yeah.\n\nOf course each dog is different but my dog never really tests my authority, he isnt really a dominant dog. He follows my commands without questions and has *never* shown me his teeths or barked at me so again, I dont know where youre getting that from.",

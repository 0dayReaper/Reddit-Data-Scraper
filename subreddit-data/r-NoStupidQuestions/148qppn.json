Not often, as we typically pay attention to where we're stepping. \n\nAs nasty as it is, it's easier to wash your foot off than digging it out of/washing the treads of your shoes. You also know immediately. You don't track it around for awhile, maybe indoors or into your car or something, before you notice.",

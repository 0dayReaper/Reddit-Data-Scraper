They called both those groups of people bitches and people who \u201chad no backbone\u201d and the rest of the group (who were filled with both liberals and conservatives agreed with him.) They then went on to say \u201cPick a side or you\u2019re standing with the other side.\u201d I\u2019ve seen this pattern a lot in life where when someone tries to see both sides they\u2019re automatically met with disdain. \n\nI\u2019m a liberal myself, but isn\u2019t that stance a bit extreme? Shouldn\u2019t we be trying to converse with the \u201cother side?\u201d Or maybe I\u2019m just not getting it, I have not idea.",

There's nothing wrong with taking ideas from across the political spectrum to make policy, and in reality I think that's the best way to do things. But sometimes centrists get lazy and just decide that if two groups disagree, the truth or best policy has to be in the middle of those two positions.  That's every bit as reactionary as extreme right or left wing ideology, but with a little bit of added smugness.",

I mean, if you spend more than 1 second thinking about it before spouting trite BS, it is very easy to think of policies that are pretty obviously right or wrong in the view of any reasonable person. \n\nStuff like what you just said is exactly why people don't like centrists. You park yourself in the middle of the issue and tell both sides that you must be right because you are splitting the difference with an air of smug superiority. You don't suddenly become wise because you figured out where the median point is on a given issue.",

You see policy as only relating to economic factors which isn't the case. Policy is also why these abortion bans are popping up everywhere. The don't say gay bill in Florida is policy.

There's nothing free in life, NOTHING and housing is a rival good.\n\nThe goal should be affordable housing for everyone, by... BUILDING as much housing as possible, increasing the supply astronomically so that prices come down (or stay the same which is a win in an inflationary economy).\n\nThe problem then is the NIMBYs of ALL sides of the spectrum: there's rightwing NIMBYs that go \"but I don't want undesireables in my neighborhood! errr I mean, my house value will drop!\" and then you have the leftwing NIMBYs: \"It's gentrification!!!\" or \"It doesn't have 100% affordable units, so we're going to protest its construction!\". 0 units built times 0, is still 0.\n\nI want construction to be non-stop, to build build build, any plot of land with a single family residence? razor it and plop a 50 apartment community with businesses on the ground floor. I want housing to be so plentiful of all kinds that there'll always be affordable housing available.\n\nOf note, I am an immigrant to America that came here over 10 years ago with $200 in my pocket, a suitcase and was staying with 7 other people in a one bedroom. I wasn't born rich, I'm not rich, I'm certainly not privileged. I \\*KNOW\\* nothing in life is free, and I'm a centrist because I refuse to believe in the delusion that stuff is free because we say it should be. I am a centrist because unlike conservatives I KNOW we have a problem (housing, racism, healthcare costs) but I disagree in the way progressives want to \"solve\" it.",

So instead of getting something we get nothing so both Democrats and Republicans can use these things as campaign promises.\n\nExamples:\n1. Gun control-Would I like to ban assault rifles? Hell yeah. Do I think we can? No because there\u2019s a lot of people in this country who will vote against their best interests to keep that fucking gun. I\u2019d rather focus on mental health check ups and making gun ownership like getting a drivers license then dying on the assault rifle hill.\n\n2. Illegal Immigration-You can\u2019t just let everyone in. That\u2019s like trying to cure kidney disease by staying on dialysis. I think the better option is making everyone already here a citizen and then using those Americans to figure out the best way to improve their homelands so they don\u2019t feel the need to immigrate here. Or use them to help create a system that makes immigration easier.\n\n3. Minimum Wage-I\u2019d scrap minimum wage and replace it with a law that the minimum wage must always be equal to the yearly cost to live in whatever states.\n\nAre these ideas good? I don\u2019t know probably not, but at least they\u2019re a jumping off point to where we might actually get some things done.",

You can't compromise on whether or not someone deserves to be a person with full rights. You can't compromise on if someone is allowed bodily autonomy. You can't compromise on peoples right to exist visibly in society without being harassed. The focus of politics in America has shifted a lot in recent years. It is hard to come to a compromise with someone that is willing to vote in people that will allow them to keep their guns.... but will also introduce abortion bans, \"Don't say gay\" bills, etc.",

Congratulations, you\u2019re part of the problem. \n\nNo, being centrist is much more than that. It\u2019s understanding that while certain things are unfair or flawed, it is necessary to carefully evaluate how to change them to not make things even worse ; after all the road to hell is paved with good intentions. It\u2019s assimilating that the world is a very complicated place, and that no ideology left basically unchecked (because built in total opposition to another, and made appealing to get the votes of even the most radical individuals) is the answer to its problems. And so much more than that.",

If you are not one of those centrists, then great. I didn't say every centrist is exactly the same.",

Hitler won Germany because not enough people cared to get rid of Nazis before it was too late.\n\nI am also not happy settling with the lesser of two evils.

We have two extremes fighting and the conservatives seem to win out in the end because no one wants to push for progress. Staying the same is easier. Also, it's a lot easier to let go of a fight if you gain very little. Some people don't have enough skin in the game and think, \"this one issue doesn't effect me so I won't fight for it.\" The problem is the moderates are always spending time picking their battles and never actually going to battle. Taking the middle ground is a bit of a cop out, too. \n\nFor a good example, have you ever seen, The Good Place. As one character put it, \"the Titanic is sinking and they want to write the iceberg a sternly written letter.\" And that's the problem. Change will never happen under a moderate.

Said conclusion may allign with one side or the other depending on the matter, so the person can bounce sides depending on the topic. They have opinions, but not (political) affiliations.\n\nThe bad centrist is the idiot that uses said position to explicitly *not* think about an issue. They will either conclude that both sides are wrong or both sides are right. And so we come to the initial joke. A good centrist would ask what the fuck is wrong with the first group.

Sometimes centrism is less about holding beliefs that happen to fall in the center and more about modifying your beliefs after the fact to fall in the center, either so that someone can posture themselves above both groups, or because they hold onto some axiom that everyone has an equal amount of wisdom to contribute (without critically examining what that side is actually saying.)\n\nPeople that do this are especially vulnerable to anchoring bias, which is when someone deliberately proposes something extreme in order to make a less extreme \"compromise\" seem more reasonable. For instance, if we were haggling and I originally said the price of something was $100, you might think $50 is fair, but if I said it was $50 to begin with, you would try and haggle the price down from there. Politicians do this all the time with policies. A good example of this is that in US politics, Bernie Sanders is seen as far left, but most of Europe would consider him center left because of how radicalized American conservatism is compared to other countries.\n\nAnd oftentimes centrism really is as simple as people not having a backbone. I think religious tolerance is a great example of this. If we lived in a world with no religion and one were to spontaneously form around antiquated values and practices, it would be a fringe ideology that would face far more backlash and criticism than modern day religious fundamentalists face today. This shows that what people will push back against has less to do with the contents of an ideology and more to do with the adversity of challenging it. In other words, a lot of people that preach religious tolerance are just conflict avoidant cowards that rationalize their passivity as tolerance even as they \"tolerate\" religions that oppress others.",

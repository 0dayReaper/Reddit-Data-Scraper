    "postText": "I have severe anxiety and absolutely hate unexpected visitors, so I got a \"No Soliciting\" sign for my front door. For the most part people seem to be obeying it, but I still occasionally get people coming to the door being like \"Hi, I'm with X Company. We're doing some work at your neighbor's house, and we thought we'd go around seeing if anyone else in the neighborhood is interested.\" Any time anyone comes to the door when I didn't invite or am expecting them, my heart starts pounding.\n\nThe other day I had this really obnoxious guy come to the door and was like \"Hi, I'm with X Pest Control. We regularly do work at the G Family's house across the street from you. You know, Mr. G, he just passed away\" (note Mr. G passed away several years ago already). \"Anyways, we're offering a discount for all the neighbors, so if you could be here between 8 AM and 3 PM on Wednesday...\" and blah blah blah.\n\nThe thing that pissed me off was when he said \"If you could be here\" because he sounded like he was expecting me to be here, even though I hadn't agreed to hire him. Also I had already told him that I wasn't the homeowner and that my parents are, but they don't live her (which is true), but he kept asking to talk to the homeowner.\n\nI really wanted to tell him bluntly that we're not interested and to please get off our property, but being the submissive wimp that I am, just let him continue talking until he finally ran out of steam. But I was wondering if it's actually illegal to disobey a \"No Soliciting\" sign.",

So I'd recommend that if this happens again, simply don't open the door. Then yell through the door that you're not interested, then walk away from the door. \n\nWhere I live in Canada, door-to-door solicitation is illegal. That still doesn't stop some of these folks from trying to sell their services (or scams, more often than not) door to door.   \n\n\nAlso, avoid giving them any details about who you are, who lives there, or when they're home. Your mention of them asking you to be home on a certain day between business hours raises a red flag for me, that they could be thieves trying to case houses that will be empty during that time. Maybe that's my own paranoia talking, but it's worth keeping your info to yourself for protection.",

            "comment": "My understanding is that people going door to door like that have the right to do so UNLESS you specifically deny consent\u2014with a No Soliciting sign. So your sign is the notification. I don\u2019t know exactly what you can do with people who ignore the sign\u2014you\u2019d have to check on local laws. \n\nBut there is no reason why you can\u2019t just say \u201cnot interested\u201d before they even start the pitch. Or you can point to the sign and inform them they are trespassing. If it\u2019s someone from a larger company, you could contact the company and I suspect they would take prompt action because ignoring your sign exposes them to legal action. \n\nBut you have no legal or moral obligation to either open your door, or to be polite if you do open the door. I usually check before I open the door, and most of the time I ignore them. They can talk to the dog through the window if they want.",

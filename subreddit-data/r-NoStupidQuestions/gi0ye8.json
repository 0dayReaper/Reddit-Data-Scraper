I wore those books out with my constant flipping back and forth.  I put a bookmark on the pages where the appendix started.\n\nI think the first book did not have (or need) the appendix but the third book had it and maybe the second.  A funny thing was that the appendix was rewritten for each book so it was neat to see how the appendix changed as people were murdered and houses were demolished.  There were no spoilers for the current book\u2014 so, for example, the appendix fr the fourth book reflects the events of the third book but not for the fourth book.",

But if you make them *distinct* and unique characters, then people will still be able to tell them apart... but may not be able to attach a name to them.\n\nIt's this weird thing where it takes good writing to be able to make characters distinct and refer to their features often, and make everything they do tied into their unique character-- that shows a really good writer\n\nbut at the same time, those great writers will often be like \"So here's a group of eight people and their families and some of their childhood friends, half of the people won't appear for more than half a page but we're going to give you the names of everyone anyway\" and you just can't keep the names straight.\n\ne: and I guess to make my point, when you *slowly* introduce the characters you have time to fully attach a name to them. If there's like two people for the first ten or fifteen pages (and unimportant characters aren't named), you're going to be able to easily figure them out and get accustomed to knowing who's who. Then you introduce maybe another character or two, and get attached to them as well. Etc. etc.\n\nThis can obviously affect the plot or pacing, so sometimes introducing big groups of characters is unavoidable, but a lot of the time some rewriting to stay conscious of making sure readers can get attached to your character can be easily done. This is the purpose of the \"introduction\" part of the story, so it's okay to be thorough.",

I need it.\"\n\n&gt;Final Book\n\n*and all the women crossed their arms beneath their breasts, sniffed, and said how stupid all men are.

Normally books I enjoy are recommended and those I didn't aren't, but I had to create a new category for WoT.\n\nI would absolutely love it if someone would rewrite the series fixing the huge /r/menwritingwomen issues, add character development, add depth to the women so they aren't mostly copies of each other, and fix the numerous plot holes. It will never happen, but it would be nice.",

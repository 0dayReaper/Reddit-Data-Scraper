Sometimes circumstances force one's hand (like having to take out metal piercings for an MRI) but a lot of people's bodies will close their holes after just a couple of hours, even if the piercing is ostensibly healed. \n\nPiercings getting tugged while you sleep isn't very common. What you really gotta worry about is rings on your fingers - those are what are going to catch and tug piercings when you absent mindedly wash your face. \n\nHow bad a piercing initially hurts while sleeping depends where it is. Nostril piercings hurt less than eyebrows to sleep on and eyebrows hurt less than cartilage. You should just try to not sleep on the piercing. If you get an eyebrow then sleep on your back or on the opposite side.",

    "postText": "\nI work at a retail store, and for about eight months, I've been friends with this guy who also works in the same department. Over time, we've formed a close-knit group, and we often hang out after work, going to movies, fairs, and restaurants. We've even connected on social media. Everything has been going great, but in the past two weeks, several people at work have mentioned that this guy, let's call him Dan, might have feelings for me. Being a friendly and outgoing person, I interact with almost everyone at work, and many colleagues from our department have pointed out his special treatment towards me. He tends to fulfill most of my requests, even when he would refuse others as he is in a leadership position. He playfully teases me, making comments like, \"Oh, did you miss me?\" when we haven't seen each other for a few days due to different schedules. I would respond with something like, \"What's there to miss Dan?\" and he would playfully reply, \"Everything.\" He also says things like, \"Stop thinking about me,\" or \"How can you have a good day when we didn't get a chance to chat?\" I haven't witnessed him doing this with anyone else, and even my friends in our group believe he might have feelings for me. The confusion arises from the fact that if he does feel that way, why hasn't he expressed it? It's not because he's afraid of being a lead, as during a conversation between just the four of us, he mentioned that if he liked someone at work, he would ask them out. He's generally a sassy and zesty person, but he's also a really good person. If we don't talk, it bothers him, and he has expressed this by saying, \"Hey, we're not talking; it's so scary when you don't talk.\" I've noticed his concern, so I'm unsure about what to do. As a sensitive, emotional, and anxious person, everything affects me, and this situation is no different. Additionally, he used to send me TikToks almost every day, but in the past couple of weeks, he has been less frequent, sharing only one TikTok every four days. I don't understand what's going on in his mind, and it adds to my anxiety. Because at work he is his normal self with me. I want to know what he's thinking because a part of me also has feelings for him, and if he were to ask me out, I probably wouldn't refuse. However, I don't want to continue feeling the way I do now. I don't want to be an option if there's nothing more to it. I just want clarity so that I can stop overthinking. I genuinely enjoy my job, but this emotional rollercoaster is exhausting. I don't know what to do because asking him directly might make things weirder, and that's something I want to avoid. I don't want him to get any wrong ideas or complicate things further.",

Many of them rely on various tools that help them get around the internet in general.\n\nVision impaired users might change the display size or colour to make it easier to see. They might use a text to speech tool, where selected text (or a description of any image) is literally dictated verbally for them to hear.\n\nDeaf users have tools that put subtitles into videos, so they can interact with them in real time.\n\nUsers with mobility issues have tools which mean you can swipe to save a post rather than needing to click. Or tools which change the display to make relevant menu icons bigger and easier to hit, which makes it easier to use for someone with limited control over their movements. Or dictation apps, so they can speak rather than type comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are all sorts of workarounds which help to make \u201cthe internet\u201d, as a general experience, easier to navigate. That includes Reddit\u2026but none of these workarounds have any functionality if you\u2019re using the official Reddit app. They never have, because Reddit\u2019s never implemented those functions as an option.\n\nEvery one of these helpful solutions to accessibility problems needs third party access to work right. What happens if and when Reddit makes third-party access pay to play, or kills it altogether?",

Reddit suggests things they want you to see to promote community engagement, and places add in the doom scroll.\n\nA third party app, for example, could limit your scroll to only seeing things from communities you subscribe to, not showing any adverts at all, and using a different text entry method to prevent issues.  They can also allow users different avenues of interaction at the data layer than the standard app allows. \n\nIn general, apps can allow users to exist in a space that prevents Reddit to do things that support its revenue model.  The users have a much better and more streamlined experience.  Reddit loses a bundle of money due to the lack of ad engagement, Gold subscriptions, and paid promotion revenue after users see returns on investment.   The apps are in general great for us and negative for them.",

Or rather I probably do, since I don't know if the 3rd party apps fix any of my problems (but let's be honest, they probably do).\n\n1. Sometimes the posts take fucking ages to open when I want to comment. Thankfully I can still scroll while waiting but I can sometimes manage to get even a few dozen posts down before the one I clicked finally opens. It legit takes 1-40 seconds.\n2. Why in god's name are all the videos unmuted after I unmute one and keep scrolling without muting it?\n3. Why do images load in full fucking quality when I open a post? It takes ages sometimes. Or maybe it's not because of quality and reddit is just slow\n4. Videos randomly refuse to load\n5. Timeline abruptly stops\n6. Sorting by top of last week for example won't show posts from the last 24 hours (not sure if some or none)\n7. They keep changing the location of sorting options\n8. Back to top button blocks votives on the last comment\n\nAnd probably many more I've forgotten about",

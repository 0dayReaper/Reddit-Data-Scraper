    "postText": "Found out my mom has dementia. She has severe memory loss and can't even remember what she cooked or ate the day before or where she leaves her cell phone. She will ask me the same question 5 times in thirty minutes. \n\nAnyway, if she didn't have us kids to help her out , I just wonder what would happen to her. She can't drive anymore because she will forget how to get home or where she is going.",

Maybe the government assists? It is really sad though.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your mom. She\u2019s really lucky to have you and others to take care of her :)",

If they were found to be mentally incapacitated a government department called the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee would take over responsibility for their finances and their medical care.  If necessary they would be placed in a government funded nursing home.",

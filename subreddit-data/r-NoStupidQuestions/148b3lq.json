I haven't really felt comfortable opening up to them, or really anyone I know irl, since I was a kid.

Not to mention my uncle has gone through some serious depression and schizophrenia the past year or two, and the way they've reacted has not instilled confidence in me that suggests they would handle my comparatively mild issues any better. And I know my mom would tell everybody about it even if I asked her not to, and those other people can be even worse.",

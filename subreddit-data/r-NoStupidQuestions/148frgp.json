A person was asking what a Florida ounce was. They thought the fl. ounce stood for Florida ounce instead of fluid ounce. It is the the top rated post of all time here. To be fair to the person asking the question, it was a stupid question, but an innocent one.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/snppah/what_are_florida_ounces/",

It turns out that if you give someone a pill and tell them it will make them run faster, they will, indeed, run faster. Give them a pill and tell them it will allow them to hold their breath longer, it will work.\n\nI immediately wondered what would happen if you gave someone the \"wrong\" placebo. Give them a pill, tell them it makes them run faster, record them running faster and *then* tell them \"Oops, we gave you the wrong pill, that one aids concentration.\"\n\nUnfortunately, I asked the question in a half-assed way without properly explaining what I meant, and effectively asked \"What if you give someone the wrong placebo?\" Which is, at the very least, a nonsensical question. By the time I got around to reading replies, the mods had deleted a number of them and had had to remind people of the name of the sub.",

Or telling an athlete that a pair of lucky shoes can help them run faster (it might work).\n\nBut on the other hand, if a doctor tells you you have a tumor and you have 3 months to live, odds are there's no amount of positive thinking that will materially change that.

But the airlines want passengers to feel secure so they welcome extra security paid for by taxpayers.\n\nIsraeli security uses profiling to decide which passengers to interrogate, but the U.S. doesn\u2019t condone profiling. So there\u2019s a lot of universal or random security that inconveniences low risk passengers. At least most Americans can now get TSA passes. They are worth the effort.",

Many of the episodes talk about the specific instances that caused things to be banned, like liquids over 3oz, taking your shoes off, etc. \n\nBasically, it's because someone used something to cause a problem. The airline wants to avoid that problem, so they stop you from taking it. It's easier than paying out millions after a hijacker kills people on your plane.",

To answer your question, it's because we have an entire generation of people who were raised in a state of constant fear and panic that was perpetuated by our government.",

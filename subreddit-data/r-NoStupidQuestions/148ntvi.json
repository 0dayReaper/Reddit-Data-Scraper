    "postText": "For most of my life I didn't really make eye contact with anyone, I don't know even why, it just felt natural for me \\*not\\* doing that. But, as I started entering in adulthood, I kinda noticed how this wasn't actually good doing so, since it could be a sign of \"insecurity\" and things like that. So, I just started making eye contact. At the beginning I was kinda... afraid let's say, but after a couple of times I realized that literally nothing bad would never happened if I make eye contact during a normal conversation, and so I started doing it constantly. Now, here is the problem. I'm not sure if I'm carrying out on the operation correctly or in the best possible way. And so here is the question.\n\n***How*** I'm supposed to maintain eye contact during the conversation? Cause til now I just establish an eye contact, keep it on for some seconds, and then aborting the connection, then establish a new one and so on, in a pseudoperiodic way with average period of like 2 to 5 seconds. But, somehow, I feel like this is not the correct way to do it. Or even if it is, perhaps is not the *best*.\n\nI know that it could sound dumb, but... could I maintaining eye contact for like, longer periods? Like, 15+ seconds staring at the hearth of the soul of the person in front of me? Would it make things better for instance at a job interview? Would I make a better impression? Like, giving the impression to be more confident or so?\n\nOr better, should I maintain insistently eye contact up to a point where is the other person to look away? Is this the normality?\n\nCause differently from many other people that avoid making eye contact, I'm not afraid at all doing that, I just want to be sure to not embarrass the interlocutor. Thank you in advance.",

I also suggest approaching the activity with curiosity.  ask yourself, \"what is this person's face and eyes telling me about how they're feeling?\"  \n\nSubtle communication happens with facial expressions that can let you know if someone is joking or serious, angry or sad, etc.  \n\nTry not to focus on the \"I'm making eye contact\" action but observing the person you're speaking with.\n\nWhat might be uncomfortable is that when you make eye contact you realize they are looking at your eyes.  That takes some getting used to.",

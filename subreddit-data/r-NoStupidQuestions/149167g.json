The shape, size, motion, smell, looks might just not have been right for this girl. Maybe she like a left leaning medium guy who smells and moves in a certain way, and you've got a large right leaning dick and you just don't do it for her. \n2. Maybe she's going through her own shit and just wanted one fuck.\n3. Maybe you aren't doing a good enough job in bed. You can always improve upon your sexual ability. There's lots of videos online. Learn to eat puss, foreplay is important, ask what your partner wants. Work on your cardio if you are getting winded. Make sure you are clean and fresh before fun time.\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about it dude. You got laid, that's cool by itself. But if you think you could do better, try and do better next time. Sex is like any skill, the more you practice it, the better you get.",

Nearly every girl on those apps says something in their bio like \"not just looking to hookup\", but plenty of them are. They just don't want the stigma of saying that out loud.",

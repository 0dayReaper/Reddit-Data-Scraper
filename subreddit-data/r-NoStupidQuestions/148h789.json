Essentially, violent crime is a very social activity, and the vast majority of people don't just wake up one morning and think something like armed robbery is a good idea. There are some radicals who will just spontaneously commit violent crimes, but for the most part people who begin committing violent crimes do so after being encouraged by their peers who are already committing similar violent crimes on a regular basis. \n\nCrime rates are really fairly simple, if a respective government can purge violent offenders from society faster than those violent offenders create new perpetrators, violent crime rates go down, and if they don't purge them fast enough crime rates go back up. For countries with already low crime rates, it's fairly easy to keep it that way since the spontaneous radicals can be quickly rounded up and disposed of before they can create networks of other violent offenders around them, but once those networks get established its much harder to get them under control since they can produce new members faster than they can be destroyed.",

We have the right to legal representation during questioning by law enforcement, we cannot be held without an indictment, and we have the right to a jury trial of our peers. This is supposed to ensure an innocent person does not end up punished for a crime they did not commit, but it makes the process slow and frequently allows the guilty to go free.\n\nIn a country like Japan they don't really have those protections, the police can question you and refuse to allow legal representation, they can hold you for up to 21 days without being charged with a crime, and criminal matters are decided by judge panels instead of juries. Japanese police have a reputation for torturing prisoners to coerce confessions, and judges have a tendency to just rubber stamp whatever is presented to them by law enforcement, so while it makes the judicial process very efficient and keeps violent offenders out of society, it also means that innocent, often disadvantaged, people very frequently get found guilty of crimes they didn't commit. \n\nSo it's up to you to pick your poison, do you sacrifice the marginalized people at the fringes of society in the name of safety or do you allow dangerous criminals to potentially go free in the name of freedom?",

We too have the right to legal representation during questioning by law enforcement and Habeas Corpus also applies.\n\nWe don't have juries because our legal system is based on civil law, and not common law (except in the UK and Ireland, which use common law and, thus, have juries). But the rest of Europe has other protections.\n\nWe also have freedom and all those legal protections, yet have less crime.",

When my body feels overestimated or when my social battery\u2019s out. Turns out I really like being alone, and once I stopped hanging out with people I didn\u2019t actually like I realized I didn\u2019t really have a reason to drink or do drugs anymore.But I also know a lot of people that need that social contact to feel fullfilled, so going days without connecting with someone is detrimental to their mental health. \n\nFor me the most mentally healthy I\u2019ve found myself has been in these periods of unintentional isolation. Everyone\u2019s different, and a straight black or white answer is rarely the solution. I just wish someone had told me five years back that I didn\u2019t need to keep pushing myself into social situations and that I\u2019d find more comfort from the solitude than the socializing and drinking.",

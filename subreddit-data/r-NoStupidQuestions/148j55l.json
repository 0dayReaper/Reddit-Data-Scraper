Add in the fact that you have a finite work/recovery capacity and if you're exhausted from cardio it's going to hurt your ability to kill it with the weights.\n\nBut, as with most things, there's a balance to be found. No cardio isn't the answer. Eat more if you have to. Do cardio after weight training rather than before. You might need to de-prioritize one in favor of the other - it is difficult to train well for an ultra-marathon and a powerlifting meet at the same time - but it's not an either/or thing.",

It's not just Reddit, though: many, many sites have search engines that are horrible. If course, what this typically means is not that they're half-assed, but that they're carefully tuned to return results they *want* you to see. Amazon is famous for this, but Netflix, Hulu, really any big retail or commercial content site, they all do this now. The Google play store has an *absolutely ass-blastingly bad search*. I even use Google to site search the Google Play store.",

That being said, idk if everything you listed is entirely true.\n\n\nGetting every side or opinion- depends, but not really tbh. Small threads with a few comments aren't going to have every side and opinion. There's also a plethora of cases involving mods banning people for random things not in the rules, such as disagreeing with them.\n\n\n\n\nStraight to the point also depends but usually sure. Irl experiences are cool, but often times redditors will make things up for karma, so its difficult to tell when someone is *actually* has a math PHD and is describing how they solved a problem or if they're a highschooler trying to get karma by paraphrasing things they vaguely remember reading about in their older siblings textbook 2 years ago.\n\n\nIn terms of information gathering, we can think of reddit knd of like Wikipedia. Except reddit has less truth based/fact checking moderation, often less info per each thread/post, and less sources (usually people don't provide any source at all). They both have info on niche things, but reddit covers more niche irl problems and Wikipedia has more niche events, products, historical info, etc.",

And so he answered every \"Is X a healthy food?\" question with a long form version of \"Any food can be part of a balanced diet.\" When people ask if Fanta, white bread, apples, or spinach are healthy, reasonable people will give different answers, but not him. He was a popular writer on other topics so Quora boosted anything he wrote until I couldn't take it anymore and blocked him.",

Are bananas healthy? They contain a lot of vitamins. They also contain a lot of carbs. Which is probably not going to matter, but it does matter if you are on a low card diet. Is a banana a healthy breakfast? Probably, but are 3 bananas a healthy breakfast? What about dried banana chips?\n\nThere are so many different factors to a diet that you simply can't just say that a food is healthy. There is quantity, preparation methods and even your own genetics can play part in that. Not to mention that \"healthy\" is really vague. For example broccoli has a lot of vitamin k. Vitamin K is only soluble in oil. That means you won't get any vitamin k if you eat plain broccoli. Does that mean that fried broccoli is healthier than plain broccoli? It is hard to say. The correct answer is \"it depends\".",

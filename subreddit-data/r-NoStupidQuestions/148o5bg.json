    "postText": "My father is a combat veteran and strong believer that actually, the US doesn't have enough guns. I was trying to talk to him about gun violence, especially the constant mass shootings we have here, and he argued that if he had a knife and another guy with his same experience had a gun drawn on him and was actively trying to kill him, no matter the distance he's going to win that fight. He also says that in a long, straight hallway with no obstacles or cover (like the one in my middle school, which is ~80 feet long), a gunman at one end of the hallway is in fact disadvantaged against someone at the other end with a knife. He says also that all these shooters would just get knives or baseball bats and do the same thing with the same body counts, if they couldn't get the guns. \n\nThis all sounds like garbage to me, the last point in particular, but he's the one with six tours of combat experience, not me, and in the face of that I don't have the confidence to call bullshit on those claims.",

Cops seem poorly trained, but one of them even had an AK-47 and all the cops had guns drawn already. But they panicked and missed all their shots. The guy with the knife did end up dying, but so did several cops.\n\nBut to OPs point, no I still disagree that knives are more dangerous.\n\nFound the video. I miss-remembered some details. Whatever saw it a long time ago, but my point still stands. Firearms do no guarantee you will prevent a life wielding assailant from messing you up. \n\nThe party starts at 7:20, warning people being killed in the video. \nhttps://youtu.be/75RTkGbiJpk",

He's probably exaggerating a lot, but there's a nugget of truth in there. Which he gets to next.\n\n&gt; He also says that in a long, straight hallway with no obstacles or cover (like the one in my middle school, which is ~80 feet long), a gunman at one end of the hallway is in fact disadvantaged against someone at the other end with a knife.\n\nThere's the nugget of truth. Guns are most effective at a certain distance, and a person with a knife can close that distance really quickly. Using a gun effectively in a life-or-death situation requires you to be a quick shot with really good aim, because you have to draw, aim, and fire before that person closes the distance. Your odds go down a lot if you can't move around to maintain distance. I think that's what your father meant with his claim that he'd win a fight against someone wielding a gun every time - he'd know to close the distance quickly. \n\n&gt;He says also that all these shooters would just get knives or baseball bats and do the same thing with the same body counts, if they couldn't get the guns.\n\nAgain, some truth with some exaggeration. Countries with strict gun laws do still have violence and mass killings, they just aren't done with guns. Mass stabbings and knifing sprees, driving cars into crowded areas, bombs, etc. The body counts on these things are usually lower, though not always. It simply takes more time to stab multiple people, and that time allows law enforcement to respond. It's worth pointing out that those things also happen in countries with lax gun laws - they just happen in addition to gun violence.",

            "comment": "That is absolutely not the case. The two cases where a knife might be better than a gun are that the gun can be more difficult to shoot if someone is literally in your face wrestling you, since you don't have space to point and aim, especially if the gun is long, and when one person has the knife out in close range and the other person doesn't have their gun ready. Otherwise, the gun's range is high, its lethality is consistent with minimal training, and it can be shot repeatedly. A knife, meanwhile, only has an arm's reach of range (or slightly more), and while it is deadly if you can strike with it properly that takes strength and training. Additionally, it takes time and effort to kill someone with a knife; it takes longer to stab several people than it does to open fire into a crowd, and it's WAY harder.\n\nNow, we don't know if would-be school shooters would take up another weapon if they didn't have guns. They might, of course. There have been \"mass stabbings\" before, but they're limited to a few victims, since once people know what's happening they can simply escape; a knife's range is short, so the stabber can only stab someone they can catch up to, while you can't simply run away from a gun if you're in line of sight. The victims may die, of course, but there would be significantly fewer casualties in the case of knife violence simply as a result of the limitations of knives.",

            "comment": "This is semi-false.  In limited situations where the ability of a knife to kill or incapacitate fairly quickly and quietly increases the lethality of an attacker over a loud and flashy gun.  Have the opportunity to knife 10-12 people if you\u2019re good / lucky before anyone figures out what\u2019s up, compared to shooting 2-3, having everyone scramble and either hide or try to stop you.\n\nThe thing that gets most mass shooters caught or keeps their fatalities lower is that as soon as they begin, they alert everyone around.  But think on it this way: a gun has a much higher potential for lethality than a knife, both in terms of distance and overall stopping power.  A knife isn\u2019t killing a person from 75 feet, but a gun can easily do that.\n\nIn almost all other situations, the gun is the superior weapon.  Lethality from a distance, some safety to counter-moves, shock value, ability to kill people as fast as you can pull the trigger (in theory, anyways).  And the ability to counter most other weapons with minimal to no risk.  There is a good reason why swords are out and guns are in world militaries.  And the \u2018get another weapon\u2019 line is bogus.  Yeah, all the bad guys have baseball bats: the police still have guns.  Their capacity to stop attacks safely goes up exponentially.\n\nSo no, as a fellow person that prefers knives to guns, the gun is the superior weapon in all practical situations.  Ask any law enforcement officer or active military person, people that rely on weapons to survive, and they will say the exact same thing.",

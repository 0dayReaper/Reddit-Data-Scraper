At some point, Meta will falter and make a decision that isn't popular with some users.  Startups will try to move in.  Maybe they'll fail, but maybe one will get some traction and carve out some territory from Facebook.",

They compete for your time and attention for advertising. \n\nThey compete by providing a different kind of social media experience. There are not direct competitors with very similar products (the coke vs Pepsi type of similarity) because of network effects. Why go through the effort of joining or investing time in a Facebook clone that has 10% of the people you want to follow?\n\nThe social media competitors deliver different experiences and then compete to make their experience more compelling so you spend more time consuming their type of content.",

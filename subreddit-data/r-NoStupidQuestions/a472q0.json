Personally I don't think it's necessary, but I know I had a video player app with gestures where swiping down lowered volume and up raised it, which was pretty nice once I got used to it (instant flick down when a video starts, no need to check volume). I also had a file manager app that could play music and had a volume slider.\n\nMost apps (on iOS) will just use the default player though, which comes with a volume slider. And if a game has a custom volume slider it's usually separated between sound effects and music. Also there are physical volume buttons so yeah, not really necessary. I personally haven't had a problem with them, though that coils in part be because Apple rejects apps that misuse volume control; it might be worse on Android.",

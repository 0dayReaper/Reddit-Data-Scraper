If you are one of these things, follow the other comment and overwrite the data before smashing. If you really want to be sure, use a powered sander and sand the hard drive to dust. \n\nAnother fun (albeit unsafe) option if you have any confidence in chemistry skills and safety is a thermite reaction to melt the hard drive. If you take this approach *do not be close when it goes off as molten metal can fly pretty far*.\n\nLaptop hard drives use glass platters pretty often and you can shatter those with a light toss, making them virtually unrecoverable. If it's an aluminum or ceramic platter, drilling holes in it usually produces enough heat that it makes the data between the holes unrecoverable for forensics experts.\n\nLast option would be acid. You need an acid that can etch glass, ceramic, or aluminum to work on any hard drive (ssd too). I think hydrochloric acid is usually used. Vinegar may work also but not sure.",

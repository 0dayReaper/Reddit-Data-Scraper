That's right in the \"occasional smoking\" category in this meta-review [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865193/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865193/)\n\nNot as bad as more intensive smoking, obviously.\n\nThat's for health in general, they are not focused on lung capacity. But here is another way to look at it: If it had no effect, there would be some Olympic athletes being occasional smoker, and there is almost none. None at all that I'm aware of in track and field.",

I'm sure my analogy isn't one to one here, but imagine you got a papercut once a week, no big deal, but getting the same papercut, on the same part of your finger, every week, weeks on end, is going to do something to that patch of skin eventually.",

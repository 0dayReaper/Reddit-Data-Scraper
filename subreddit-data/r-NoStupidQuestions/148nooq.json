Vegetarians ate what vegans today eat, lacto-vegetarians ate dairy products as well, and ovo-lacto-vegetarians ate eggs, dairy products, and plant products. Vegetarians would often choose that solely for health reasons, and therefore many would still use leather. \n\nOver time, the word vegan came into usage to focus on the idea that animals shouldn\u2019t be used at all, and vegetarian evolved to mean what used to be called ovo-lacto-vegetarian. Of course, the cumbersome nature of that last term contributed to it being replaced with something simpler. But vegan and vegetarian are the words we have today with the meanings we have today. A hundred years from now, they might mean something different.",

In 1847 with the official formation of the Vegetarian Society, eggs and dairy were accepted as part of the vegetarian diet. Between 1909-1912 the consumption of eggs and dairy was heavily debated within the Vegetarian Society, as some members of the group were in support of the original stance to exclude eggs and dairy from the diet. The debate continued and from the 1920\u2019s-1930\u2019s the support to exclude eggs and dairy continued to grow. In 1944 the Vegan Society was formed, they created the word vegan and defined the word and philosophy behind veganism. \n\n[The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/)",

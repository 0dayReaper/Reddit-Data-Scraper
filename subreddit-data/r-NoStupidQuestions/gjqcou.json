Having no family, she had given up hope of getting a nice photo taken.  Then, one of the state workers managed to secure a small grant to get her a photo session.    \nThey had contacted other local photogs, and none of them would do the shoot for the low price.  I grew up in poverty, so there wasn't a chance in the world I would make her go without photos just because the money wasn't there.\n\nAt the beginning of the session, the girl was very closed off and shy.  By the time we were done, she was humming and singing and dancing around the park.  I'll never forget her smile.",

I'm not exaggerating when I say that there are more pictures of me with goofy faces than \"nice\" faces.\n\nSelfies are just...100x worse, for some reason. Take all those issues from above, and then make it look just plain **bad**. I don't know why my (very few) selfies have turned out absolutely terrible, but that's how it is. I'm sure I'm overly-critical of myself, but even putting that aside, I honestly cannot figure out how to get a selfie to turn out ok. So I just don't do them, except in very rare cases.",

It is also not only ok but good for your mental health when you realize that you are worth taking a picture of yourself, admiring yourself once in a while IS A GOOD THING.\n\nAlso if you care about what others might think DON'T, if they judge you for simply taking a picture of yourself they are idiots anyway and most people DO NOT CARE.

If your taking pictures of yourself 10 times a day, yeah, you're overdoing it. But here and there? Nah. There's good reason to take selfies.\n\nLet's not forget the historical selfies, which required people to stand still for hours while they were painted. What sounds more cringe and narcissistic? A quick snap of a picture, or investing hours in a portrait you will hang up in the public lobby of a huge mansion for servants to goggle as they slave away for you?",

I love seeing my friends faces on my Insta feed, I don't need it to be full of impersonal photos I could have found on Google.

Obvi nobody should base their entire worth on social media, but everybody needs a little attention.  We're all isolating right now, am I supposed to feel bad that nice Instagram comments from my friends make me feel a little less alone?",

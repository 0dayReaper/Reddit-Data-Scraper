A craftsperson invests many years into their craft before creating masterful artifacts. Use this time to invest in yourself and to think about how you most want to impact the lives of others. This will lead you to identify a struggle or issue you think you can help create solutions to. Then the real work begins. You'll discover tools, skills, abilities, or other puzzle pieces you may not possess yet, and will start the earnest work of self investment and improvement towards your cause. You are not yet the instrument of change you wish to be, but you will be. Godspeed.",

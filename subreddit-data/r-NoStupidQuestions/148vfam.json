If they allow you on the plane and it turns out when you land that you don't have a valid visa, the airline is usually / often financially responsible for getting you home, since they should not have allowed you to board. So you can BUY the ticket without a visa but normally you should be denied boarding if you don't have a visa by the time of the flight. Or, you get rejected on trying to enter the country, if for some reason the airline allowed you to board anyways.",

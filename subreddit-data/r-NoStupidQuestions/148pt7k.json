            "comment": "Noise-induced hearing loss can happen two ways - repeated exposure to loud sounds over time, like going to concerts; or a single exposure to one extremely loud noise, like a gunshot or firework going off right next to your ear. It's highly unlikely that your music reached the a level similar to a gunshot, so you'll be fine. But do protect your hearing in general - if you listen to music make sure it's at a safe and tolerable level. There is no cure for hearing loss.",

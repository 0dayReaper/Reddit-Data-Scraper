    "postText": "My family has a dog with set up schedules for who has to take her out when ( this was put in place for school days because my sister refuses to move her lazy ass with out being told to by a parent). This used to work, however it has recently turned into her taking the dog out minutes before my parents get home so she isn\u2019t scolded. For some context we both normally get home at 3pm with our dad leaving for work at 2pm so the dog is in her crate for about an hour. However, my mom gets home at like 6-7 on average so my sister will normally end up taking her out at 6:30 or whenever my mom is pulling into the neighborhood. I don\u2019t like seeing my dog like this so I end up taking care of her. But I am so tired of doing this, what should I do?",

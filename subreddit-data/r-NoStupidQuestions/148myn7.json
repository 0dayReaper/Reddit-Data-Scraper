    "postText": "Do you guys wear shoes in your homes? And why? I am genuinely asking, because I KNOW it's NOT an American thing. Everyone I know, friends or acquaintances, don't wear shoes in their homes anymore.\n\nI grew up seeing a lot of friends and their families wear shoes into their homes, even when it's carpet (and most were carpeted 30 years ago). I even see them get into/in/on/onto/all over bed with those on. I don't know if it's a culture thing, or what. But in my household, we always took our shoes off when we entered anyone's home (an Asian thing, but I'm sure a lot of cultures do this as well) - unless we were told to keep them on. Fast forward 30 years later to present day, I RARELY know ANYONE who wears their shoes into their house anymore. In fact, it seemed to me less and less people wear them into their homes, regardless of race and background.\n\nBuuuuuuut\u2026. Then one day, I get a call about my mom's tenant moving out of their house which they had rented out for 1 year. This was rented to a family with children where the government paid for the rent. I don't know what the program is called; I just know it's for families who are not well-off at all. Anyways, I get there, and the carpet had basically turned black from shoes being worn in the house. No matter; we accounted for carpet cleaning anyways. But still, I have not seen dirty carpet like that since I was 8 years old at my friend's home.\n\nThen I spoke to a friend who used to work for children services, and that topic came up. She said that most of the homes she's visited (which was every day), MOST of them wear shoes inside the house and it's filthy dirty. \n\nI thought back to when I grew up, my friends and I were dirt-ass poor too. Could that be the commonality?\n\nSo my theory was that shoes in the house are a result of 1. children, AND 2. being very poor.",

They are separate shoes and i dont mix the two except for wearing my inside shoes out onto my porch or sometimes to run into the kitchen to grab something real quick (not carpeted floors, not with muddy shoes). My feet and back hurt a lot if I dont wear supportive shoes but i cant imagine wearing shoes i've tramped through public life in my bed?! \n\nI certainly was not allowed to wear shoes inside growing up. We also had separate clothes i.e. play clothes vs school clothes (ofc school clothes eventually became play clothes bc shit happens).\n\nI would imagine the difference is generational manners/etiquette, sometimes mental health issues (hoarding can necessitate wearing shoes inside). I've known some poor ppl who take great pride in what little they do have and keep things neat/tidy and i've known some wealthier ppl who didnt really care bc they could easily replace things/have someone else do the cleaning.",

Every so often subreddits will do a questionnaire for their subscribers, age and gender are usually the first and second question. A large portion of reddit is still under the age of 18, and are unsurprisingly mostly male. \n\n\nGo back a dozen or so years from when I was in high school. Barely anyone at my small rural high school used reddit, let alone heard of it. Only people to use it were part of the small computer geek crowd. \n\n\nReddit really wasn't mainstream at all back then. Nowadays however it is very mainstream, hell, even my parents have heard of it (baking/cooking stuff and from reading/watching the news) \n\n\nOn top of that I feel like the 13-17 year olds of today are much more politically and socially engaged compared to when people my age were 13-17 (late 20s to early 30s). \n\n\nSo add up all those things and that is in my opinion why reddit is just screaming into the void about doggos and politics. \n\n\nIf you want the classic feeling of reddit you'll need to dig a little bit and find small but active communities.",

You used to be able to import old Stumbleupon links to the new site, it might still be possible. Other than that, there is r/internetisbeautiful which occasionally has some great new websites posted, there are many curation portals, mainly for articles, (apart from Pocket) like [Refind](https://refind.com), and I always encourage people to search for anything they're curious about. Searching your interests, even if you know everything about them, can lead you to some pretty niche websites. Google's algorithms have been a hit or miss lately but DuckDuckGo still seems to turn up proper results. \n\nI know it's easier to simply scroll through feeds of the 4-5 regular sites you visit, but there still are a lot of interesting websites out there and many are making new ones, with the main struggle being getting people to their websites and engaging with it and not just seeing the screenshots on social media. The internet's economy is attention and we can all be a little more mindful of where we spend it.",

I know there's a group keeping updated versions of Wikipedia pinned on their nodes so that folks in countries that can't access it via HTTP (like Turkey), always have access to information.\n\nhttps://blog.ipfs.io/24-uncensorable-wikipedia/\n\nBrave just launched a new version a couple days ago that supposedly has a one click install-a-node feature. I haven't had the opportunity to play with it yet, but I'm building a home server for a number of things and will for sure be tossing an IPFS node on it.\n\nIf you set up that node, you can re-pin stuff (like videos, websites, anything online really) the node will download it and re-host it. Think how Bittorrent works for downloading music/movies but using that technology to make sure parts of our collective knowledge of humanity doesn't disappear because someone stopped paying for their web server.\n\nThis is a good starting point if you want to learn more: https://medium.com/virtuslab/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-9713a6f59193",

There\u2019s no way bump things or have a running conversation over a long period of time unless you pin the thread, but each sub can only have two pinned threads so it\u2019s super limiting.

Some used Lycos, others liked AskJeeves or Dogpile. I still remember when someone told me about google and thinking that sounded like a name a baby came up with. Your search engine of choice was a way of saying something about yourself and how you used [The Net](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/BKDTJC/the-net-1995-poster-BKDTJC.jpg), as we sometimes called it. \n\nThe point is, everyone used the internet differently. There were lots of ways to choose and curate your experience. \n\nToday, the internet is vastly bigger than it was then, with exponentially more content, and what content there is is exponentially more sophisticated and interactive. But our gateways into it are narrower, though fewer, massively popular channels. These channels are also more defined by our peer-group (digital or physical) than they used to be. \n\nYou never learn about fringe content if you only ever check social media sites like Reddit, Twitter, Snapchat, etc, because those people all tend to talk about the same things, as well as seek out content from similar places as you do. The result is a digital experience that feels very insular and contained.\n\nThe content is there. People just aren't actively seeking it out as often or in the same ways as they used to.",

Then, after scrolling past the paid links, the stuff goggle thinks you want (Reddit links from 2015) and second wave of paid links the web starts to open up. Once you're into the equivalent of the third page you've begun mining. I use the 'open in new tab' function to open possibles in the background until I have four or five tabs waiting. Then it's jumping in, wading through the data and jumping off links you find to find further info. If you find a forum spend some time kicking about the threads and see if there's anything interesting. If you hit a blog scroll beyond the first few posts. Actually look through galleries. Actually read the story before the recipe.\n\nIt's all about seeing the web as a new continent; you're exploring and finding strange people and odd sights but like as not you'll stumble across some natives you can either simply pillage for gold or, if you're lucky, settle in and make a new home for a while.\n\nThe old metaphors hold true; surf the datasea, hitchhike along the information superhighway, the journey is not necessarily about the destination but more the fiends you meet along the way.\n\nTooltip: never go to reddit.com/all/ and only use Reddit as a jump off point: Reddit is the MacDonalds map, it'll only ever tell you where it's specific brand of junk food is and sometimes it's better to just drive until you find Ma's Drivethrough Diner and Hotrod Museum",

There's a reason things evolved the way they have, and it's because broadly speaking, it works. \n\nThe thing about the early net is that it was messy. If you go out onto the fridges, it's still messy. And that's not what most people want. They want refined content/experiences, etc. \n\nAnd that's not a bad thing. Consider Youtube. The content it contains is wildly diverse. But Youtube as a platform provides a clean, simple, powerful toolset for both content creators and content consumers. \n\nYes it means Youtube has more or less become the default portal for non-adult video content, but the content itself is about as diverse as it could reasonably be.\n\nWhether or not that means Google has become too powerful in hosting/enabling the types of content we're \"allowed\" to see is a much, much bigger question that we're actually seeing a lot of conversation on right now in the wake of all the Trump bans (though obviously it was long ongoing before then, too).",

A lot of the early stuff was innovative because it was managed by nerds who knew the tech behind making websites and geared towards people who were willing to seek it out, whereas now is managed by CEO types or algorithms and geared towards everyone.\n\nI think we need stricter antitrust laws for companies that buy out successful websites/businesses, and funding grants/loans for ones that struggle and might benefit temporarily from being bought out. \n\nWe can't let the market decide for itself or else it will just focus on the biggest, and we can't let the state run the thing itself directly or else it will become authoritarian.",

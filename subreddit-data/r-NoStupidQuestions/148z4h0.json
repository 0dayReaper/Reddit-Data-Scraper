You give them an item, they give a fraction of that items value. You get a set amount of time to pay back the money they gave you plus interest and they give you your item back. They only keep the item to sell it for way more if you fail to pay them back on the agreed upon terms of the loan. Some pawnshops also out right buy items for a fraction of their value, but generally the function of a pawn shop is to use items as credit to secure short term loans. If you ever sell or pawn something and feel like the amount you got was shit, it's probably because your stuff was shit and you were simply trying to pass the burden of selling the item for its full value to someone else. Convenience in all it's forms is the most expensive thing there is.",

Any time I have to communicate outside my head with words, I have to \"translate\" what I'm thinking. That takes time and effort. It's why I vastly prefer written communication over verbal, since you can take more time than the instant response a verbal conversation requires.\n\nWhen I know I will need to verbally communicate (such as if I need to make a phone call or bring up a topic at a meeting), I prepare mentally as much as possible so I know what words I actually need to say.\n\nOn the other hand, if I'm in a conversation where I haven't had time to organize and translate my thoughts ahead of time, I constantly have long pauses where I'm doing it in real time, which comes off as weird to people who notice it. This annoyed my wife for a long time until we both realized why it was happening.",

I remember a thread where the majority said they cant imagine tastes which was weird for me as Ive always been able to do that. For example when I think of biting into a lemon I can sense the sour taste in my mouth and my mouth starts watering. The same goes for smell, I love the smell of garages (weirdest thing Ive said in a while) and know exactly what it smells like. Sounds are some of my favorites as I make music myself and love to imagine sounds to a drum beat and in my dreams Ive composed the best sounding music Ive ever heard.\nWhat interests me about you though is that you cant imagine images. If you thought of your favorite movie scene you couldnt picture it in your head? Youd know what happens in that scene but you couldnt see it in your mind?",

I recently discovered that this was a thing, and that people could actually see and visualize what they're reading.\nIt blew my mind that day dreaming is an actual thing, and not just zoning out and staring into nothingness with nothing going on in your head.\nTo me, the idea that you can picture and visualize things sounds like a super power.\n\nEdit: The inability to imagine, picture or visualize things in your head is called Aphantasia. \n\nI've been getting a lot of questions about dreams and memories. Yes I do dream, the dreams can be vivid, however most of the time they aren't. But then when I wake up, all I recall are the events that took place in the dream, I can't replay the dream in my head.\nAs for memories, it's all faint lines. What I recall are my feelings during those memories, or mental notes or connections I've made, such as \"the sun wasn't bright\". Sometimes I can see a very faint image for a mere instant, but nothing substantial.\n\nWhen I'm asked to picture something, the best I can do is described as follows. Let's pick an apple for example. So imagine you're drawing the apple with a pen. Except the pen has no ink, and the paper is black. At its best, all I see is the faint traces of the apple drawing. That's the best way I can describe my visual in aptitude. \n\nCheck this [video](https://youtu.be/ewsGmhAjjjI) out, she explains Aphantasia really well!",

Like if you asked me to picture my mother, I'd picture the photo that comes up on my phone when she rings. If you told me to picture my mother riding an elephant (something I've never seen before) I'd come up blank. I'm actually picturing a photo I have of myself on an elephant, but I can't \"swap out\" myself for my mother. \n\nBecause of this I find it really hard to imagine things I haven't seen. My husband makes clothes, and he'll try to describe to me \"you know that green dress you have, I'm thinking like that, but shorter, and maybe in a pink floral pattern\" and my brain is like NOPE! Or he'll ask \"how do you think that couch would look in our living room?\" and I have absolutely no idea how it would look, it's like my brain is trying to cut and paste two images together. \n\nOutside of imagery, I'm great with creative problem solving, analytics, and insights - I do it all day every day as my job. I am just terrible at visualisation.",

I can't imagine a thought not as a verbal construction. All my thoughts are *colored* by the physical parts of different emotions, but they're all words.\n\nLike I can imagine being physically angry for a moment without verbally thinking it (my heart would be racing, maybe my shoulders shake, muscles tense up, etc) but I can't imagine being *aware* of any of my physical emotions without thoughts as language. Like my internal monologue while my body was having the physical anger response would be (inner monologue in parenthesis):\n\n(\"oh fuck this bitch she's being such a hypocrite\") -outloud- \"YOU'RE BEING A *FUCKING* HYPOCRITE\" (\"she's gonna say it's not the same because----\") \"ITS NOT THE FUCKING SAME AND YOU KNOW IT\" (\"---there she fucking goes I knew it so fucking predictable I'm pissed I'm never talking to this bitch again, where's my shit?\") \"Where's my shit I'm leaving BYE\".\n\nFor me half the definition of the emotion \"*being* *angry*\" is the internal monologue of ranting, raving, cussing, bitching, etc. (plus the physical response). I'm not even sure what being *emotionally* angry (not the muscle tenseness and heavy breathing or whatever, the physical stuff) would be inside my head if it wasn't a stream of thoughts as words.\n\nAs a side note, do you rarely have frediuan slips or say something you didn't mean to? When I was writing my example above it reminded me of when I've been in fights and my internal monologue has included the word \"bitch\" but I slipped and called them that out loud when I wasn't planning on it and kind of surprised myself or gotten frustrated with myself for losing my \"filter\" on my monologue. I'd assume that doesn't really happen to you?",

The people with Aphantasia accordingly between 0 and 3. Means: There are among us (I also belong to it) quite some who can imagine something dimly. At least briefly.\n\nThe distinctions are quite seamless. Probably also a reason why people with Aphantasia don't really stand out.\n\nEdit: Better wording.",

I do have sort of a voice in my head while typing or reading, but the only thing it does is narrate the words. I don't form my thoughts into actual sentences, because that just seems like a waste of time. The voice only happens as a translation from my abstract thoughts to language (or the other way around) when I need to. (This is also how I classify \"knowing\" a language. If I am unable to form the sentences directly into the language, and it is interrupted by a better known language, I am not yet sufficient in it.) However, I do sometimes get music stuck in my brain, so I have that imaginary audio.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a thread about the similar situation with mental images. I don't actually \"see\" anything when visualizing, however the thought is there. I don't describe the images in words either, it's just there, with no actual form, abstract. So, I feel like the question to those who claim to see images is: does closing your eyes actually help you picture something? For me it makes no difference whether or not they're open, as my \"mental image\" \"looks\" nothing like an actual image. It's just...super abstract. And, I don't consider myself to have any particular problems with creativity, since I enjoy drawing and painting quite a lot.",

Surely the only voice you can think in is your own!  In my mid twenties, my own mother moved into mine and I very clearly remember the first time I thought in her voice realizing this was going to be a new normal for me.  It was quite surreal.",

    "postText": "(The Apple TV sub is currently closed and this was the next best option)\n\nHello. I recently rented a movie on Apple TV and it won\u2019t work. I am using the iPhone app (I have an iPhone 12 if that helps), and every time I flip my phone so that the movie can fill the screen, the entire thing moves off screen and only shows the top corner.\n\nI tried watching on my parent\u2019s phone, who has a higher phone model than mine, and it worked fine. It only worked fine once, but right when it finally worked the wi-fi stopped working so I couldn\u2019t even carry on watching.\n\nI\u2019ve also refreshed the app many times, as well as deleted and reinstalled it.\n\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thankyou! :)",

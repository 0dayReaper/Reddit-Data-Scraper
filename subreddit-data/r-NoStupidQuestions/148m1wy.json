I\u2019m in a small town and on the street off mine, there is a house with big TRUMP PENCE 2020 banners. No matter how liberal the state, or even how conservative it is, like Texas, the big cities are always liberal and the towns are always conservative. \n\nBtw only used Texas as an example bc overall it\u2019s very red as far as I know but Austin is one of the most liberal cities in the US.",

            "comment": "I didn\u2019t write this but someone commented it years ago and I\u2019ve always referred to it.\n\n\nThe way my political science professor answered this question when I asked it many years ago was \n\nWhy cities go blue and the rural goes red.\n\n\"In the countryside, you have the right to swing a baseball bat around so long as you don't actually hit anyone, that's your god-given right. In the city where there are a lot more people who you need to coexist with, you want the freedom to not get struck by some maniac swinging a baseball bat around.\"\n\nIt's a difference in how these regions interact with government services and society in general. People living in cities are used to problems being solved collectively. Your garbage is collected by the city, you walk to the subway station on a city sidewalk, take the city run subway system to work everyday alongside a million other people, etc. I mean, even the housing is done more communally with apartments instead of large individual homes.\n\nIn a rural area, it's very different, the government doesn't have anywhere as much of a presence in your life, public services in rural areas amount to a (maybe) paved road and the promise that if you call for help, they'll send the fire department within an hour. Problems within the community are solved on an individual level, don't own a car and need to find a way to work? I hope your neighbour can drive you or else you're walking (and there won't even be a public sidewalk for you to use!). This extends to politics, rural areas tend to prefer policies that favour individualism.\n\nThere's also the fact that cities are less homogenous which means you are exposed to a greater variety of people from a greater variety of backgrounds which encourages inclusion and tolerance.\n\n\nIt helps to keep in mind that \"Team Red vs. Team Blue\" has always had a \"rural vs. urban\" flavor to it.\n\n\u2022\t\u2060For Team Red (rural), all the things that Team Blue wants are things they just do for each other as part of being neighborly, so Team Blue literally looks like a bunch of extra taxes and regulations to help a bunch of big-city neighbors who refuse to take care of each other and also want to take away guns and gasoline/diesel---things that are important for their way of life. It's not that Team Red wants to make the rich richer, it's that they're afraid Team Blue will make THEM poorer (while the rich get richer anyway.)\n\u2022\t\u2060For Team Blue (urban), there are more \"neighbors\" than a human brain can possibly track, and it's impossible to take care of each other efficiently without delegating it to public servants and other specialists. So Team Red literally looks like a bunch of heartless racist assholes who want people in cities to starve while poisoning the air and water and murdering children in schools for some reason.\n\nAs long as we continue with a two-party first-past-the-post voting system instead of a ranked-choice system that allows more than two parties, game theory demands that Team Red and Team Blue keep polarizing the electorate to the fringes.\n\n\nMost of them start out honestly trying to make real changes.  Once they get in and understand the process you quickly realize you cant do as much as you want without the support of others, and with the support of others comes the I will scratch you back if you scratch my back mentality.  And its all downhill from there.  You will have to make deals your against to move forward, you will have to lie to someone to get the support of someone else. And so on. You cant make it to the top without making lots of enemies.\n\n\nThere's also the problem that your constituents may accidentally force you to lie to them somewhat.\n\nIf you give the voters realistic promises, then those promises will sound boring and unimpressive compared to a different candidate who is promising the moon. The electoral incentive is to overpromise and underdeliver. So the candidate who is misleading has an advantage over the candidate who is honest about what can actually be done.\n\nWhich of course makes everyone more cynical about everything.\n\nMaking deals is not necessarily dishonest; in fact, people have to trust you to make deals with you.   Each person can just be furthering the goals they were elected to do, even though they disagree with each other. Congress members do not report to anyone.  If there is no top dog, all joint action is through negotiation.\n\nYes there are positive negotiations, but at some point you will have to compromise yourself for your career.\n\nCongress members are owned by those who donate a significant amount to their campaigns. You need lots of money to win at this level, money comes from those that will benefit the most from electing you.",

When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

It's a sprawling collection of suburbs, which have the downsides of both cities and rural areas. You have too many neighbours and people in your surroundings to know them all, but you also never interact with any of them because you have to drive to do anything and driving is very isolated when compared walking, biking, or transit.",

Been to Las Vegas once and my partner spent some time growing up in Texas, so I can definitely confirm that the city vibes are different.\n\nEdit addendum:\nWe visited cities when I was younger to see plays and go to baseball games and stuff but it was always under the impression that they were unsafe and dirty, you know?",

I wouldn\u2019t call these people friends, more like mutual acquaintances, but the things they say sometimes about, for example how black people are bad at English, having rarely if ever met a black person, it\u2019s just really depressing \n\nI personally have been treated badly in areas of New England after people learn I\u2019m from New York.

In my city of 300k for example, much of the city's history there were large swaths of the city which were off-limits for blacks, latinos, or \"South Italians\" to purchase a home or rent.  \n\n\nBut, when you ride mass transit, you're riding with everyone.  When you're going to school, usually there's a much wider mix than your local neighborhood.  This is at least true with highschools. And if you attend college in an urban town you're again much more likely to be in classes with a broader mix of races than say Cornell.  \n\n\nMy neighborhood is predominatley white, and I'm aware of that... I wish it weren't so segregated, yet it is.  But, if I take a walk along the river, go to the movies, spend some time at the local park, I'll generally see a much more diverse group of people.  My son and I ride our bikes over to a local park, and some days it's over 3/4 black kids at the playground.    \n\n\nI can't imagine having a similar experience in a rural area at all.",

When you're in a rural environment where the closest civilization is a 20 minute drive away, you have a certain sense of responsibility to yourself and your family that you will have to take care of them and be prepared to act if anything bad were to happen. If someone falls down a deep hole, the fire department may take up to an hour to make their way to that hole and dig you out. If someone has a medical emergency, god knows how long it's gonna take for an ambulance to come save you.\n\nI have an example of this from my own life. When I was about 11 old, my stepmom had a heart attack in her sleep. We lived about 15 minutes away from the nearest immediate care center and about 30 minutes away from the nearest hospital. When this happened, my dad called 911 and they said they would get an ambulance out to him in 30 minutes, which is an eternity when your wife just had a heart attack.\n\nWell, my grandparents lived in the house directly across the street from us, so they came over. They had the phone number of a fireman that lived in our neighborhood a few houses down. The fireman came over and immediately started preforming CPR in the meantime. He called his people in the fire department and immediately had a truck come over with a medic to give adequate care. This was all in about a 15 minute stretch. Now imagine how much longer and more dangerous it would've been if they waited 30 minutes for an ambulance, a 15 minute ambulance ride + the bills that come along with an ambulance ride.\n\nIn situations like this, these people in a rural area came together to help each other during urgent events, even if they don't know each other. This happens a lot in rural communities and this is what reinforces the individualist ideals seen in rural folks. This is also why right-leaning people tell left-leaning people to \"figure it out yourself and stop whining\". For lots of rural people, they are on their own in a lot of aspects even down to government services like reliable access to the Internet.",

They want something to step in and replace that. Cities are also filled with big businesses who want conservative policies so they can make as much profit as possible. They tend to wind up with the social polices the little people want and the big business policies the employers want, but the liberal policies get more attention (people like to show off \"winning\" and it's a great way to get even more people to move to the city), while the conservative ones downplayed (businesses never want to advertise exactly how badly they're screwing you over, and like I said, they want you to move there and become their labor force)\n\nIn small towns, with their lower costs of living, people are far more likely to own stuff, and have that family and community safety net nearby. They have a sense of ownership over the entire town. So they act like the big business people in the city: they want their stuff protected from others, and for people to butt out of telling them what they can or can't do with it. Conversely, smaller towns are more likely to have liberal business policies. There are fewer workers, so they have to play nice. They are much more likely to have things like unions, which protect the workers' rights. Unions are bad for big business, so painting everyone as idiot hillbillies, (and therefore conservative people are idiots,) is to their advantage.",

Can't speak for other countries, but unionized workers in the US are heavily concentrated in the cities, and have been for a long time-- maybe early 20th century histories of coal miner unions and the like are distorting your perception? Though even in those days, the unionization movement started in urban manufacturing workers and spread to rural workers. \n\nCan't find any hard numbers, but here's some sources discussing the urban/rural distribution of unionized workers: [1](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/rural-workers-color-need-15-federal-minimum-wage/), [2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231211022094#bibr2-23780231211022094), [3](https://migrationfiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/rmn/blog/2023/04/Rural%20Migration%20News%20Blog%20323.pdf).",

There are plenty of jobs that require apprenticeships and practical knowledge over more technical knowledge, and many of them are dependent on each other.\n\nTake a warehouse. The people who construct a warehouse are largely tradesmen: plumbers, electricians, heavy equipment operators and the like. Before they can pour a pad, however, they require experts, geotechnical engineers, to examine the build site and let them know what they need to do to prepare the site for construction. Once the warehouse is done, it's run in part by labor, in part by logistics experts, and in part by technical people who ensure that the various automation systems and inventory systems and the like continue to function.\n\nIn cities, there tend to be higher concentrations of technical people, as those tasks generally require large amounts of infrastructure while taking up less working space. In rural areas, there tend to be higher concentrations of tradesmen, as their jobs tend to require more space and less infrastructure.\n\nLevel of education or kind of intelligence don't enter into the conversation; it's all skilled work, just different kinds of skills. The issue is that each type of work sees itself as more important than the other, rather than two equally important parts of an integrated system. Advanced in farming technology still require skilled tradesmen to help design and operate them, as an example.\n\nIt's an artificial divide being exploited by people who want to stay in power, and it's a trap that's oh so easy to fall into.",

They know people can look up the stats and figure out the deep red areas of the country are taking way more than they are giving in taxes.  The poor inner cities often have very wealthy counterparts on the other side of the city that balance it out.

In small towns everyone may literally know everyone, or at least know everyone through someone else. In cities that's literally impossible, so traditional institutions that maintain one set of values like churches are literally impossible to maintain over an entire city. This is a long way of saying that mixed values are inherent to cities, while country areas remain traditionalist strongholds.\n\nThere's far more to it than that, but that's a basic overview of the root causes of it.",

Some guy may have 5 times as much as you in a small town, but not 5 million times as much like in a major city. Everyone knows everyone in a small town, so there's not the same sense of alienation that is just assumed to be part of life in major cities. You have a different perspective on gun ownership when it takes cops 30 minutes to get to your house and gun violence is almost unheard of in your community versus if you the cops will show up in under 5 minutes and where mass shootings happen frequently. Many small towns are propped up by a single big business, and if that business goes under, the town dies. And they're protective of that business. Meanwhile, major cities have so many businesses that you can hurt a few dozen without anyone noticing the impact. And does anyone think for a second that being surrounded by nature everyday vs. being surrounded by skyscrapers and smog doesn't affect how people instinctively feel about the environment. Homeless is a major concern in urban areas. It essentially doesn't exist in rural ones. \n\nBasically, conservative politics is an attempt to shape the government to give rural people the same economic opportunities that city dwellers already have. And liberal politics is an attempt to shape the government to give urban dwellers the same sense of community, acceptance, and access to nature that is the norm in small towns.

In most areas of the country, rural is synonymous with white and Christian.  They have limited exposure to people of other races, religions, cultures, etc.  They have little exposure to art (plays, concerts, museums, galleries, etc).  Minorities (racial, gender, sexual orientation, etc) avoid these areas, stay in the closet, or do their best to blend in for safeties sake.  Meanwhile, if you live in a city you are surrounded by people that are different than you.  You work with, live next to, and are friends with people of different races, religions, and cultures.  You eat various foods and partake in various forms of art and entertainment.  People in cities appreciate new and different.  They are open to new experiences and have a more open mind.\n2. Success.  Rural areas tend to be poorer, and the poverty tends to be deeper.  On top of that, rural areas have less resources for underprivileged people.  Rural areas have less opportunities.  Fewer sports programs, fewer fine arts programs, fewer advanced classes, fewer scholarships.  Rural areas have less job opportunities, and when a business closes, the people in those jobs likely have no other similar job opportunities to fall back on.  On top of that, even if you have a stable, dependable job, there is likely no competition, so no way to get pay raises as there is nowhere else you can go.  The American Dream is much harder to achieve in a rural area.  Meanwhile cities offer all sorts of opportunities.  The American Dream is moderately easier to obtain in the cities than in Rural areas.  The people that have been told about the American dream but are unable to obtain it need someone to blame.

Compare that with, e.g. Northampton, Massachusetts, or even with most of the rural areas along the Texas-Mexico border.  Vermont is one of the most rural states in America, and also one of the most left-leaning.  And Texas is not very red.  Republicans win power in Texas pretty consistently, but also by relatively small margins.  It's nothing like Wyoming, Utah, Alabama or Mississippi, or if you're looking for a state with some large metropolitan areas, Tennessee.\n\nAmerica has urbanized heavily over the past few decades.  Very few people who grew up in big cities have moved to genuinely rural areas, and those have been mostly to work in mineral extraction industries. \n\nUrban and suburban areas have grown a lot.  Some of this growth has been Americans from rural areas moving to urban areas for work, but who would prefer to live in rural areas.  These folks tend to live in outer suburbs, and the outer suburbs of many large American cities are about as Republican-leaning as the genuinely rural areas.  Others moved because they genuinely prefer urban culture, and they tend to go to the big cities or their inner suburbs.  Then there are also foreign immigrants in the big cities and inner suburbs.\n\nPsychologists have found that the personality trait \"openness to experience\" (essentially an interest in new and different things versus traditional things) correlates strongly with political ideology, and it also correlates with preference for rural versus urban life.  It won't be 1:1 with party affiliation, as, in particular, libertarian types often vote Republican, but have a high openness to experience, but it correlates pretty well, especially with the present ideological coalitions of the two parties.  Pre-Reagan, it correlated much less well, as there were more socially moderate Republicans and more socially conservative Democrats.",

So people in cities grow up with ethnic cuisines, ethnic neighbourhoods, vibrant arts and performance scene, a wide range of people around them in parks &amp; libraries and shops... public transit brings them into contact with strangers, trade networks are dense in cities and people of different languages and ethnicities do business with one another...  there are a lot of points of contact with \"The Other\".\n\nBut if you grow up on the corner of No and Where in the agricultural hinterland it's a very different experience, you might only know a couple of hundred people your whole young life and only ever share a car ride with family or friends.  There are things to be said for that too, like the intimacy, continuity, and deep local knowledge of a multigenerational small rural community.  (Not to mention the juicy, juicy gossip!). But it doesn't breed broadmindedness, quite the reverse.  You could get to adulthood and have never seen a non-Anglo person except on TV, for example.  You could never have eaten any other kind of food than Middle American Stodge.  And so on.\n\nAlso people in dense urban areas learn early that you need to be somewhat considerate of others because you're all crowded together.  So there are noise ordinances and parking ordinances and building codes... a lot of rules.  Out in the country you can pretty much get away with stuff, there's a lot more personal license;  law enforcement is sporadic and thin, there's a lot of space to do stuff in without bothering anyone else.  There are things to be said for that \"wide open spaces\" feeling of being able to build a wood shed on your property without going through weeks of planning permits.\n\nSo it's not surprising that people from homogenous low-density backwater communities tend to be naive and/or racist about foreigners and their \"peculiar\" ways -- and also tend to get prickly about \"the Gummint interfering in my life\" because they're used to a lot of license and open space.  They also are less likely to attend a high-quality school, and less likely to be exposed to media/news/movies from outside their opinion bubble (Fox News pretty much has a lockdown on most of the \"red\" states -- in other words, a sophisticated urban \"news\" outlet pretty much controlling what news rural people see and hear).  The odds are that they've never seen a foreign film (even dubbed) at their local cinema.\n\nAnd they tend to be defensive and have a chip on their shoulder -- because urban folks feel superior to \"rubes\" and like to make fun of them.  Including in the mainstream entertainment media which make their way back into the hinterlands, carrying mockery and condescension with them.  When people in commercial media are making \"screamingly funny\" comedies about hicks and rubes, they don't often stop to wonder how the hicks and rubes will feel when they watch the show/movie.  They're making the show or movie for people like themselves, sophisticated urbanites.\n\nSo there's a kind of tribalism there, a friction between urbanites and ruralites -- goes back all the way to civilisation probably, because Roman literature documents it.  Shakespeare often used \"rude Mechanickals\" (rural artisans or labourers) for comic relief.  Anyway, feeling an enmity &amp; resentment towards urbanites often leads to a broad-brush contempt or disdain for all their urban values, such as education, the arts, liberalism, tolerance, etc.  If it gets intense enough you end up with MAGA and the Qult and flat-earthers and so on.\n\nThat's how I see it anyway.",

However those same policies can be detrimental to rural communities.    \n\nGun control might be associated with stopping violence in an urban area but that same policy would be viewed as taking away peoples right to hunt and defend themselves in a rural area.   You have a very different perspective on crime and self defense if you call 911 and know the sheriff can\u2019t be there for half an hour and you are on your own until then.  \n\nEnvironmental policies are another huge divide.  \n\nEnvironmental policies that raise energy costs are much more harmful to rural communities who already have higher energy costs and lower incomes.    Even minor increases can have devastating effects on their standard of living.  Most rural communities are not anti environment, they live there.   They are pro survival and want a more balanced approach.   \n\nLook at areas in blue states like Eastern Oregon, downstate Illinois, and upstate New York.   All these rural areas are outvoted by urban areas in their states.\n\nUsed to be in the past that urban politicians wouldn\u2019t vote policies that harmed rural areas as it would cost them votes statewide for their party. However given the polarization they don\u2019t even try to get those votes now and just write them off.   They therefore take a very liberal position without regard to the concerns of the rural minority .\n\nThe reverse is happening in red states where the urban minority is not considered.    \n\nIn both cases the minority sees the other side as tyrannical and imposing their views on others.",

            "comment": "Short answer: isolation lends itself to confirmation bias. Accessibility lends itself to a re-evaluation of implicit bias. \n\nLong answer: generally small towns are closer linked to the farming industry where only but a few own most of the land. With that ownership comes entitlements, both \"personal\" and  \"public\". They tend to lean more republican due to them benefiting from republican entitlements as being a business owner that involves large swaths of land. The line between personal and public entitlements are easily blurred within this context (aka.. I own my house and I can paint it whatever I want).  This personification is more easily adopted as a base line of thinking/rationale by others (non business owners / property owners) in these isolated communities by proxy, or lack thereof. This is how isolation will lend itself to confirmation bias within these communities. \n\nGenerally cities are not so closely linked to the farming industry and there aren't large swaths of land owned by a very few, rather there are far more people that own their property in a given district. Because these owners aren't directly seeing the same entitlements that farmers see owning large swaths of land they don't benefit the same as rural land owners do from republican entitlements. This makes the line clearer between personal and public entitlements. Due to that distinction the land owners in the city generally focus their political value on more moral issues. This personification is more easily adopted by others (non business owners/property owners) in the community by proxy as a base line of thinking/rationale. As well, the accessibility to a more dense community forces city dwellers to re-evaluate their implicit bias more actively.",

            "comment": "A couple of reasons. First, I suggest looking up Tiebout Sorting, it directly talks about this from a political perspective. In Layman's terms, it is called 'voting with your feet'. Americans in general will move to where they feel the government policies already fit their own desires. This is mostly used to talk about choosing a place to live that maximizes your personal Utility, where you end up with other like minded people. Best example would be people's desires for education and willingness to pay taxes at younger ages, and then not desiring such at older ages and moving to retirement communities that don't allow milages for education.\n\nSecond, there is more of a rural 'take care of yourself' sentimentality in the US. This desire to have a piece of land that is your own private property tends to be more in line with 'small government' types of people. \n\nThird, Rural areas have a history of being racist towards non white farm owners. The department of Agriculture used local representatives to handle business, which played favorites with loan dispersements. An investigation sometime in the 2010's found that historically, White farmers were getting loans in 1 month on average, and black farmers' loans were taking on average 6 months or something along those lines. This drove a lot of black farms out of business during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nLastly, banks in many states were racially selective with where they would give housing loans, creating de facto segregated cities. One of the best modern examples I can think of off hand is Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan. Grand Rapids was something like 95% white, while literally across the street the population was as much as 30% black and 15% other minority groups.\n\nAll of this tends to concentrate people into distinctive groups in those areas.",

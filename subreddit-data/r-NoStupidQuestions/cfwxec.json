Let's follow your corn example through.\n\nSay someone finds a way to harvest corn more efficiently, corn prices fall, and those 90 people get laid off. In this case GDP would not fall as you claim. Firstly, according to you, the new efficiencies in corn production will make corn cheaper and, unless demand for corn is perfectly inelastic (note: it isn't), more corn will therefore be demanded in the first place. So even this early, real GDP has increased because we now have more corn being produced. \n\nNow let's look at the downstream effects as well. Although those 90 people who have been laid off now are out of work (albeit temporarily), every person in the economy, even those outside the corn industry, benefit from cheaper corn and food prices. That savings being passed on to the consumer isn't wasted, they can either save it or spend it. Either way, that savings goes back into GDP as investment or consumption. The weakness in your example is the line \"All other things being equal, GDP will drop\", but that's not the way to think of economic dynamics, they're dynamic for a reason.\n\nThere are some problems with GDP calculations, one of which is the problem detailed in the question; specifically whether just because someone is willing to pay something, is that thing worth that much? Other problems like the Broken Window Fallacy are genuinely good critiques of GDP as a measure, but this talk of GDP measuring inefficiency doesn't hold up too well to scrutiny.",

There is obviously a point when people will have all the corn they want, but we're nowhere close to that point. In other words, that's an absolute, not a marginal understanding.\n\nAssume corn costs $1/lb today and people demand 100 lbs at that price. If prices fall to $0.90/lb, it would pretty crazy if the entire economy demanded exactly the same 100 lbs of corn. Even if the entire economy only demanded an extra lb of corn at the new lower price, GDP would go up. This is what I was talking about earlier when I talked about assuming elasticity isn't 0.",

                                    "comment": "Gross domestic product is a measure of all goods and services produced in a time period. Its use as the universal measuring method of economic health is often questioned by pointing out that it often reflects goods and services that don't actually add value to the economy, while ignoring less easily quantifiable economic factors.\n\nIn this example, Buffet points out that the GDP can be manipulated simply by buying something from a close relation, then transferring the money back. By purchasing a painting from his wife for $20 billion, he has added that much to the GDP by the sale of a good. But he didn't add $20 billion of value to the economy. This type of transaction is super common today, especially in the financial sector. \n\nMany economists see the GDP as a flawed measure of economic health because it only looks at quantity over quality. It doesn't take into account unpaid work like at-home parents, which certainly have a huge economic impact. It also doesn't look at the distribution of capital, and whether it's done in a way that encourages optimum economic health. Some have argued, including the creator of the concept of GDP, that the financial sector shouldn't be included in it at all, because all of their profits are from the transfer of fees with nothing produced. Some even claim that the financial sector in the US is a net drain on the economy. GDP also doesn't take into account inflation or the cost changes of basic goods like fuel, food, rent, etc. In fact, increasing all of those \"improves\" GDP, while lowering the financial security of citizens. Should the value of resources purposely left available for future use be counted, or the economic value clean of land, air, and steams? What about redundant services, like replacing a car four times in ten years because it keeps having severe issues? That adds a lot to GDP without much real growth. Those are all non-zero numbers that have an impact on the economy, but aren't included in the calculations. \n\nBasically, the issue is that the GDP takes the complex question of \"How well is this country doing?\", and oversimplifies it into an easily presentable figure while bleaching it of nearly all real meaning by assuming that more money being moved is always a good thing. \n\nBut is that the only measure of success of an economy? Why not look at the percentage of national income devoted to essentials of life versus discretionary income? Maybe the amount that the average citizen has for retirement? Or at a measure of happiness through through polling? Would asking citizens whether they feel financially secure be a better measure of success? These measures would likely tells us much more about the true health of the economy than a single number, but don't make for easy reporting or go nicely on a political ad. \n\nGDP is a child of industrialist thinking that has been carried over into a more modern and complex society, while maintaining the mindset that pure profit and bigger numbers are the sole measure of economic worth. Our world is drastically different than it used to be, and it may be time to change how we think of economic health.\n\nEdit: To clarify that it isn't just a few outlier economists saying that the financial sector in its current form is a drain on the economy, [here are my sources about the difference between constructive and redistributional economic activity](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/cfwxec/could_jeff_bezos_create_his_own_movie_make_the/eue26pf/). Not all aspects of the financial sector are a drain, and not all are bad either. The risky and zero-sum are becoming increasingly common though.",

Amazon already cuts it a little close with antitrust laws, so I can't imagine he'd want to tempt the DOJ like that.\n\nAlso, whatever theater did this would be putting themselves out of business. None of the major studios (or even the smaller ones) would show their movies at that theater again.\n\nEdit: Did not expect this many responses, but I should state I'm not any kind of antitrust expert. I'd be interested to hear from someone who knew more.\n\nA lot of you are saying that a theater making 3 billion would for sure take this deal. Obviously, if Bezos is handing out $3 billion theaters would line up, but I'm working under the assumption that Bezos is trying to get this money back.\n\nAnother common response is that he could do this outside the US. That seems a lot more feasible. I'm assuming most major movie markets have similar laws in place, or in the case of China have limits on international screenings. If he went to a country with a less developed film industry he could probably avoid this law, however.",

Assuming he buys every ticket of course.\n\nHell it might even be a good film. But then nobody can watch it. It belongs to Bezos. I'll have to sneak into the theatre to watch it, like some kind of delinquent, bootleg popcorn smuggled in under my hoodie. But I'll fail of course. *Nobody* steals from Bezos.\n\nMy first attempt to sneak in will be stymied be a security guard. A guard I did not hire. Bezos hired him. \"This film is only for Bezos,\" he'll tell me, kindly yet firmly. \"You have to move along.\" The guard hasn't seen it either. He wears thick earmuffs to deaden any sound. No scrap of the film escapes.\n\nI'll escalate my attempts. I'll jump a fence, only to find out Bezos put dogs on the other side. I'll hire a crane but it won't show because Bezos bought the company. We'll dance, back and forth like this, for years; all the while the greatest film never seen is showing in the theatre to an audience of ghosts.\n\nJust like Bezos wanted.\n\nThen, in my 50's, older and tireder, I'll try one last time and... there he'll be. Standing there. The man himself. He'll let me in with a smile, as the cinema rolls the film. With an audience. Just the two of us. Together.\n\nThe film is blank. It's a white screen, devoid of meaning. It is nothing. It never existed. I wasted my life for nothing.\n\nNothing... but the pursuit of art.\n\nBecause that's what art *is*.",

Assuming they write every version of course.\n\nHell it might even be a good copypasta. But then nobody can read it. It belongs to Bezos. I'll have to sneak into the library to read it, like some kind of delinquent, bootleg Reddit accounts smuggled in under my hoodie. But I'll fail of course. *Nobody* steals from Bezos.\n\nMy first attempt to sneak in will be stymied be a security guard. A guard I did not hire. Bezos hired him. \"This copypasta is only for Bezos,\" he'll tell me, kindly yet firmly. \"You have to move along.\" The guard hasn't read it either. He wears thick earmuffs to deaden any sound. No scrap of the copypasta escapes.\n\nI'll escalate my attempts. I'll jump a fence, only to find out Bezos put dogs on the other side. I'll hire a crane but it won't show because Bezos bought the company. We'll dance, back and forth like this, for years; all the while the greatest copypasta never read is posted in a thread to an audience of ghosts.\n\nJust like Bezos wanted.\n\nThen, in my 50's, older and tireder, I'll try one last time and... there he'll be. Standing there. The man himself. He'll let me in with a smile, as the browser loads the comment. With an audience. Just the two of us. Together.\n\nThe copypasta is blank. It's a white screen, devoid of meaning. It is nothing. It never existed. I wasted my life for nothing.\n\nNothing... but the pursuit of art.\n\nBecause that's what art *is*.",

It\u2019s not like the studio handed it over for free. \nMWR absolutely paid for it to be shown on base. They spend a good bit of money on things like this to provide service members something affordable to do. Keeps them from drinking all day!!",

            "comment": "A wealthy business man stops at a small town, and searches for a hotel to rest for the night.\n\nHe goes to a small dingy establishment. \"How much for the night?\". \"100$\", the hotel owner at the reception answers. \"Ok, here's the money, but I'll have a look at the rooms now. If I don't like any of them, you'll give me my money back and I'll search for something else in this town\". \"Deal\",  answers the owner.\n\nThe owner gets the money, and while the business man is checking the rooms, he runs to the bakery. Business had been slow, he did not had the money to pay the baker for his guest's breakfast bread for some days now, he owed him 100$.\n\nThe baker takes the money from the hotel owner, and runs down the street to the coal retailer. Business had also been slow, he did not had the money to pay for his oven's coal this week. The baker owed the coal retailer 100$.\n\nThe coal retailer takes the money, and runs to the cabaret. Not many people had been buying his coal, he did not had the money to pay for the prostitute's services last night, and she was not happy about that. She was owed 100$.\n\nThe prostitute takes the money, and runs up the street again. She owed 100$ to the hotel owner for using his rooms to receive her clients for a couple of nights,  but they had not paid her yet, so she was also low on cash.\n\nThe owner gets the money just in time for the guest to come back from his inspection. \"I don't like the rooms, give me my money back\". And so he does, and the business man leaves.\n\nSo, before the business man comes to town, there's 400$ of debt between the town's inhabitants. After he leaves, there's 0$ debt, without any value being created or added to the system.\n\nMoney in = Money out",

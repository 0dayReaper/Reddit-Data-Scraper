It was: Let's talk about the ideas behind the work, and the people matter less... It was kind of a gimmicky thing, but lots of feminist women were doing it.",

Not so much the act of typing your name in all lowercase, but the fact that they felt the need to put \"(lowercase intentional)\"? If it were just a lowercase name, I wouldn't have thought much, maybe \"oh that's cool, that's different\" but with the additional emphasis on drawing attention to one's name, I'm just kind of confused by it\n\nLike putting a t-shirt on inside out, but with words on the chest that says \"inside-out intentional\"",

But now that I live in another state I'm surprised to see products still labeled with Florida ounces. \n\nI looked up 'Florida ounces' but couldn't find much information about them.

It's wild how much we can be conditioned to just do things because that's how they're done. \n\nSomeone I knew growing up has serious body issues to the point where she would sometimes avoid showering because she didnt want to see herself naked. Her therapist told her to just shower with the light off and it made a huge difference. \n\nMine was a laundry basket. I was working with my therapist on some ADHD issues and mentioned how I always hated the laundry that piled up all over the bathroom because I'd take off my clothes to shower and just leave them on the floor and never take them back to the hamper (in my bedroom). She said \"could you just put another hamper in the bathroom?\" And in the 20 minutes it took me to go to the store and buy an extra hamper it literally solved this issue I'd been fighting with myself over for years. Just because I grew up with the hamper in my bedroom and it never occurred to me that I could have more than one.",

(This includes not knowing Apollo 13 was real while working with Cpt James Lovell. He was very amused after he overcame his panic that I was a denier. I also did not know seahorses were real until I was 19 or so... I could go on :)\n\nEDIT: some punctuation.\n\nOk, bonus story. I did not know a thing about baseball. While working on a commercial during a live game I mistakenly ran out into the field in the middle of a said game...and was promptly arrested. I later told the judge, truthfully that \"I thought it was half time....\" and he, like many other befuddled people over my life asked me where I was from... Detroit, in the 1970's at least, really was a whole other world.\n\nEDIT 2:  When I joined reddit I was stoked to find this sub. I would have given anything to have it in my early adulthood.  I did call many libraries in my day - remember that anyone?! - which was the pre-google way you could learn/find out about things. I remain grateful to all those smart, crisp, matter of fact reference desk librarians who answered so many of my basic, dumb questions without making me feel like an idiot.\n\nEDIT 3: Thank you for the gold and kind words \n\nI've been on here while on quick breaks at work and it is very heartening to find that the stuff I tried to cover up, make up for, hide and overcome is not actually all that shameful and maybe even amusing for some (self included). \n\nYes, Detroit had a team and I even knew about the Tigers but I had never seen a game before the incident and never had a TV in my house or access to anything *normal* like baseball. All my energies went into keeping myself and my little brother out of foster care (and yes, that sounds sad and it was but it gave me a lot of focus during a rotten time in an awful place).",

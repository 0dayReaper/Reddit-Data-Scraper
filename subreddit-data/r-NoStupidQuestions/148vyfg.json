(don't wanna offend anyone, just genuinely curious for someone still confused after web surfing)",

The treatment for this is generally hormone replacement and gender affirming surgury.\n\nThat said, that's not all trans people. There is also just a general movement to break apart the gender binary and it's hold over society. This is.. A larger topic",

This isn't just a mild feeling, but one that causes them severe suffering. \n\nThe most effective treatment for this thus far discovered, is for them to transition to an extent that they feel comfortable.",

            "comment": "Yes and no. Some studies have been done but they're all fairly inconclusive. The whole thing is made more difficult because one of the things that is conclusive and shared across cultures is that kids don't develop a sense of gender until about age four. There's probably a whole bunch of reasons why people are trans, some biological, some psychological, and some sociological. \n\nWhat's important is that when we look at research into trans wellbeing and quality of life the best way (so the way that causes the most consistent and notable positive increase) to increase wellbeing is accessing transition, whatever that looks like for the trans person, especially if the trans person is heavily involved in the decision making for their own care. \n\nWhat's also important to think about is that trans people don't really get a choice in the matter. It's not an easy road to walk and we're aware of that going in, so we try really hard to be our genders assigned at birth. But it hits a point where we're completely miserable. We don't choose what gender we are, but we are eventually forced to choose between a safer but miserable life that usually ends with or involves a suicide attempt, and a less safe but happier life.\n\nIt's also just naturally going to be difficult to get your head around. It's like trying to imagine what your native language sounds like to someone who can't understand it at all - it's a total shift in worldview that involves trying to understand a very different experience that you'll never have. Trans people don't expect to be fully understood. What we want is to be safe and respected. If you're doing that you're doing fine.",

            "comment": "Since science hasn't been able to simulate brains yet, we don't really have direct proof but like others have said there are hormone imbalances that can be measured.\n\nHowever, it's not hard to fit it into known science.\n\nWhen dna is mixed from mother and father, new combinations are formed and sometimes the copied dna contains changes or mutations. \n\nSo it's only natural that a certain percentage of people don't feel 100% male or 100% female. We can even see this in nature with some animals able to change gender (like frogs).\n\nAnd it's only logical that a very small percentage of people will have a brain and body that doesn't match up. \n\nBiological animals always have huge variation in how their genes turn out and humans are no exception.\n\nWe are also no longer as much subject to natural selection (dying from starvation or disease before producing offspring) so as time goes on, there should be more variation, statistically speaking.",

Once we finished i sat down and checked my social media page, and the first advertisement i saw was a shelf from ikea. I then kept scrolling and the second and third were furniture. I haven't search anything related to furniture on my phone.",

            "comment": "I work in tech. People wildly underestimate how smart algorithms are, and how your information is used to sell you stuff based on where and when you are (not a typo).\n\nFacebook/Google know that you and \"John\" and \"Ben\" are friends. They know when you hang out, because you all likely have your location turned on. They know that if Ben Googles a particular gaming chair while he's hanging out with you. Combine that knowledge with what you have personally searched for online in the past 4 weeks, which webpages you have visited, which cookies you have agreed to, what type of equipment you've purchased online in the past 6 months and which games you bought and downloaded.\n\nBen, being your buddy and all, might share your hobby with you. He also Googled, visited, agreed to and bought things that fall into the category of \"equipment,\" \"gaming,\" \"bedroom/office furniture,\" \"computers,\" or even \"Fortnite\".\n\nBen has now helped Google/Facebook in creating targeted ads for you. Google knows that you are likely to purchase a gaming chair based on the info above.\n\nSo no, there is no secret agent listening in on your conversations. But they are \"eavesdropping\" all the same. Just not in the way you think.\n\nEdit to add: People also wildly overestimate their ability to remember things and underestimating just how strong confirmation bias is.\n\nYes, you haven't bought or talked about [instert thing here that you randomly discussed, and now your feed is filled with ads] but chances are that:\n\nThere was already an ad for this thing somewhere. Because you're constantly bombarded with ads, your brain filters out what it doesn't care about. Your brain is still taking notes, though, so when something triggers an otherwise \"garbage\" memory, you now store it in a list of \"important things to watch out for.\" You are now noticing ads for this thing.\n\nAdvertising is literally filled with highly educated people whose only job is to come up with ways to store this shit in your brain. From colors and shapes, to the temperature and music in malls, over to small phone ads on that annoying news site you frequent and massive billboards on the street.\n\nThey know you work out and that your mom googles diet pills, so now your feed is filled with diet pills that you have literally only had one conversation with your mom about.\n\nYou ate lunch at a really good Mexican restaurant and your dad mentioned that he needs a new pair of spandex pants for running. You get ads for tacos and pants - what? Well, your dad sat close to you with his search history, and there's likely a spandex pants store somewhere in the 2km radius. Also, that one time 6 months ago when you pretended you were gonna join the gym and googled gym related topics.\n\nI encourage you to sit down with a group of friends and pick a topic from a box of trivia cards. Keep your phones on and \"listening\". It might help put your mind (somewhat) at ease.",

So sure, it\u2019s smart.  Smart enough to listen to our fucking conversations when the results should otherwise have absolutely zero bearing.

There would be espionage and certain other legal liabilities that would apply if this were the case, anyway. Plus, it seems easy enough to test the theory by just breaking or disconnecting your microphone and continuing to use your phone otherwise as normal.\n\nWith that said, if you have any sources (even just a tech blogger or the like) claiming that phones are passively using your talking points for marketing reasons, I'd be interested in reading them.",

Many of those libraries are linked through many of your apps, and the apps passively pass information to those library/services, and those services aggressively collect information about you. They can collect some very detailed information about your phone usage, what apps you're using, where you've visited physically, other people who have been in proximity to you, etc.",

And they're recording a few seconds of audio and analyzing it looking for that specific wake word (or wake phrase). That recording **stays in RAM** and isn't saved. Once it's detected then the audio will continue to record and stream to the the audio to the servers where it's converted to text and then to actions.\n\nAnd to be clear, the local language processing happening on the device **can only detect** the wake word you set (you can change the wake word and your Echo device will take a little while to download a new model capable of detecting the new wake word), so it's not pulling out other words or key phrases. It's not like the home device says \"oh, this guy is talking about lawn chairs, and didn't say 'Alexa', I'm ignoring that\", it doesn't understand anything outside the wake word it was trained to detect.\n\nAmazon also make available to you all the recordings they capture from your Echo device, in the Alexa app on your phone.

At this point, you're basically arguing that phones are capable of powering themselves with magic, have unlimited processing power, and can transmit data over invisible radio waves that you aren't billed for and can't be detected by any instrument. And also that advertising companies have unlimited processing power and storage, and super advanced AI algorithms that are so smart they can figure out what product you were talking about to advertise it to you, but somehow also so stupid that they will advertise a product to you that you literally just bought.\n\nBecause that's what it would take for your assertion to be true.\n\nThis is called argument from ignorance. You can't think of/refuse to accept any better explanation for why you are getting those particular ads, so you automatically assume some wild unproven conspiracy about them listening. I mean what else could it be? It *couldn't possibly be* that your other friend was already searching online for gaming chairs which is why they asked about it, or they searched for that particular model during/after the conversation to find out more about it, and this interest was passed onto you via proximity from location services and social graphs.\n\nAnd it couldn't possibly be that the only reason you were thinking of taking your nephews to that museum was because you already saw ads for it, and the idea was swirling around in your subconscious mind even if you forgot about the ad specifically. Or that the data showed you had already taken them to the museum once before, and school holidays are coming up so it would be a perfect time to target ads at you to take them again. Or that you're constantly getting ads for that museum and ignoring/forgetting them, but you only consciously take note of them now that you're actually planning on doing it, which is a very well know phenomena knows as the frequency illusion.\n\nNo, those explanations are too simple, and don't fit into this narrative of a conspiracy theory you've already made your mind up about. And besides, big data algorithms are hard, you don't understand them or know how marketing psychology works, so it couldn't be that. And obviously you're too smart to have your thoughts and behaviour manipulated by advertising, clearly companies spend billions of dollars on marketing that doesn't work. And these explanations rely on simple data points like internet search activity and location services, data which we know internet advertising companies have because we willingly give it to them. No, it **must** be 24/7 passive microphone listening and voice processing specifically, the one form of data that those companies go out of their way to say they *don't* collect, and would basically bankrupt them and put their executives in jail if we found out they were. Sure, that's more likely than simply feeding your data through an algorithm that accurately predicts your behaviour, mechanisms which we have studied to death and know work well.",

I can confirm that there is definitely no listening going on when you background the app. iOS will even tell you when an app is using the microphone. Some weird audio bugs also pop up when the microphone turns on and turns off, this is pretty obvious in the Alexa app, for example.\n\nAnd to clear up one common misconception, yes the phone listening for \"hey siri\" or \"okay google\" is technically listening and recording (for a few seconds at a time), but that audio detection is done locally on a phone. Then once it's recognized it will continue recording until the speech it detected pauses, while streaming that audio to Apple/Google/Amazon, whomever. But it's not constantly streaming your audio to some server somewhere to target you ads. \n\nI wish this rumor would die because it really does distract from the insane amount of data Google, Facebook, et al are collecting about users. Which as this whole post demonstrates is so creepy people think apps are listening to them.",

Maybe in 100 years we'll have the data storage, labeling, language/voice modeling, and AI needed to do so, but right now, it's not only infeasible/technically impossible, but it's also not profitable or worthwhile to do so. There is enough legal data and machine learning techniques out there to very easily predict what ads users like out there that it's just easier to buy/hire people to do that then to listen and record everything you say. We're much more predictable than we like to think.\n\nHere's a test. Take your phone, and ask Siri to make a note and then put your phone in your pocket and just start talking with people in the room around you. Take your phone out of your pocket and look at the note. Here is a case where your phone **explicitly tries** to listen to what you are saying and it can barely understand you.\n\nSome devices do listen for \"wake-up\" words like \"Hey Siri\" and \"Hey Google\" but notice that doesn't always work well either. You might wonder, doesn't that mean they listen to everything? No. It's much easier to build the device to locally wait and hear for a specific \"wake up phrase\" than it is to actually listen and interpret all the words you say. That's why it breaks all the time.\n\nThere are many respect security researchers out there that would be chomping at the bit for a story that indicates tech companies actually listen and understand everything you say via your phone or other devices. There have been some shitty stories about stuff like that out there, but none that actually say or prove what you're asking. But the reason why that story hasn't broken is because it just doesn't happen (at least at the big companies, maybe some small unknown ones do it like some kids toy or something). The only times they can hear what you said and access it is if you give feedback. E.g. you say \"hey siri what time is it\" and siri says something stupid or dumb, you can say \"hey siri send feedback to Apple - that was bad\" and then they will send the back and forth to the team to debug what went wrong (they need to know what happened obviously to intake your feedback).",

Now I see red SUV's everywhere, when I hardly ever noticed very many before. I don't think that there were suddenly more red ones out there just because I bought one; I just notice them more (particularly in parking lots) because my brain is thinking about mine, even if just subconsciously. \n\nSo you had just finished putting a cabinet together. Your brain is still processing that. So you see an ad for cabinets and your brain says, \"hey that's what I'm working on! Cool!\" So it stands out to you. If you had just finished playing a football game, that ad could have still been there but because your brain was still fixated on football, it wouldn't have even registered that the cabinet ad existed. You'd have scrolled right past like we all do for most of the ads we come across.",

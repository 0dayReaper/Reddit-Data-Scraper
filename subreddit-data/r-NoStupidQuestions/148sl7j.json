We\u2019re starting to see every substance coming into America from the south cut with fentanyl because it\u2019s cheaper. It takes such a small amount to get you high compared to cocaine or meth or any other number of substances. In my state, we\u2019re seeing such an increase in ODs due to this issue.",

Fentanyl is just a very strong opioid, so when people dont know theyre getting it, its easy to do too much, shooting past the desired effects and going straight to nodding out or oding.",

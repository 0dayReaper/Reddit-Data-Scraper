    "postText": "When I'm sleeping in a bed someone else has made, I immediately \"unmake the bed.\" The blankets are stuffed underneath the foot of the mattress, essentially affixing them to the bed until kicked out or removed. I hate this. It feels constricting, like I'm being squeezed by the blankets, and it makes it hard and uncomfortable to move my legs, so I kick the blankets free immediately. I assumed that everyone does this, because I never thought about it that hard, but the other night when sleeping over at my partner's mom's place it occurred to me that maybe the constricting feeling is part of the appeal, and that's why people stick the blankets under the mattress in the first place when making the bed.\n\nDoes anyone out there not unmake the bed?",

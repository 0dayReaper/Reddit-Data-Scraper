            "comment": "For a first baby, the only thing you really absolutely need is a mattress, a car seat and diapers.  Everything else is optional. \n\nBabies really don't even need clothes, to be honest.  They are just for fun. \n\nOur car seat allowed us to purchase additional bases, and connected to a stroller, which was very convenient.  Swaddles were a life saver.  \n\nA swing is really awesome, but babies are kind of particular about their swings.  It is better to have the baby and see what they like, rather than buy one.  If you do buy a swing, make sure it can rotate, because some babies respond to forward and back, while others prefer side to side. Also, get one that plugs in.\n\nHaving a kid is really fun, because you get to experience all the things that confused you as a kid on the adult side of things.",

Pop them in there, put on some Lo-Fi or lullabies or something, and gently bounce them, they'd be asleep within minutes.\n\nId get so used to bouncing them in there that when I would doze off while they napped, I'd continue to gently bounce it in my sleep lmao.",

For all practical purposes, this is useful\n\nIt gets blurry when it comes to the Old World cause people have been migrating, conquering, and displacing each other since millenias ago. E.g., the English are descendants from the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes who displaced/assimilated the Celtic Britons, but they themselves are part of the Yamnaya migration\n\nThe UN definition for \"indigenous\" stresses more on their lack of power in society than their inherent nativity for this reason",

My ancestors came here hundreds of years ago, this is my home, I was born here.  If you ask someone on the left, they would probably disagree.  If I went back to my European root countries, they would call me an American, not one of them.  It basically comes down to political subjectivity.",

            "comment": "Simple question with no simple answer. \n\nSo the easiest answer is if your ancestors have inhabited the land you live on for \u201clong enough\u201d. \n\n&gt;How long is long enough? \n&gt;How many of your ancestors need to be native? \n\nThese questions are complex and depend on the history and culture of the region. Native is a human construct, and therefore is open to interpretation, debate, and change. \n\nHumans have migrated for our entire history as a species. Long long ago we were isolated in one little corner of Africa. Over the millennia we have spread to every corner of the globe. So there are no peoples who have lived somewhere forever. The aboriginals migrated to Australia just 60,000 years ago. \n\nThe easiest area to talk about is the \u2018New World\u2019.  We can simply say everyone was who was there before the age of discovery is native. Everyone who wasn\u2019t, isn\u2019t. This ignores migration of the \u2018native people\u2019 before the arrival of Europeans. It also means that people with European heritage living in the new world have no native place. \n\nThe \u2018old world\u2019 is even more complex. Are the English native to England? They migrated from Germany in the 5th century. Is 1,500 years long enough to be native. When they arrived they displaced the native Brittons. I believe that their language and culture stayed alive in Wales. So are only the Welsh native? \n\n- - - -\n\nI\u2019m not going to commit to an answer of the second question. It is very political. I will say that in Australia, you are considered aboriginal (native Australian) if you have any aboriginal ancestors. Whereas in America it is decided using \u201ca controversial system of blood quantum\u201d. \n\n- - - -\n\nTL;DR: Native is a construct. Who is or isn\u2019t native will depend on the culture and history of the people and region. For all of human history people have been migrating. It is a useful concept, but you will go mad trying to make any concrete claims.",

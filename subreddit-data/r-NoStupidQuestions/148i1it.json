There are MOUNTAINS of evidence that show spanking doesn\u2019t, AND it is bad for your relationship with the child and causes them long term harm. \n\nLook- if a child is too young to be reasoned with, they are too young to understand why you are hitting them. And if they ARE old enough to be reasoned with, WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU RESORT TO HITTING THEM?!\n\nNope. No good reason to spank.",

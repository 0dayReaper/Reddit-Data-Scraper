It\u2019s unhealthy. There are certainly many many countless times I\u2019m in the wrong. But on shit that\u2019s so certainly not my fault, how do I properly vent without feeling like I\u2019m victimizing myself and asking for sympathy? Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as so and so fucked me and now this.. any advice is appreciated. I\u2019m not seeing a therapist but maybe I should idk. I\u2019ll be fine and have been fine without them.",

I\u2019ll never forget the time he stood up to my mom about me and she actually conceded, and there were numerous times he broke through to me and I realized I was wrong. But he was empathetic, complimentary, etc to me\u2026 ig you\u2019re right he was a good guy and helped a lot. I\u2019ll look into it.",

My experience is similar to yours but my mom didn\u2019t concede so I was pulled out of therapy and I still regret that shit",

(And you still have 45 minutes to waste, even if stuff is slow.)\n\nI'm in the 1.5 hour camp, personally, but it can get tight.\n\n4 is fine, if there's a nice cafe, or some shops, but the seats aren't confortable enough for me.",

            "comment": "Yeah that was probably a bit early. It's understandable though. I've always heard people say \"You should get to the airport two hours before a flight's departure time, and three hours for international flights\". But even that seems like it may be excessive based on the last few times I've been to the airport.\n\nStill, always better safe than sorry. Read a book for a few hours and forget this ever happened.",

You have 3 hours where no one is expecting you to be productive. Play on your phone. Watch a streaming movie you've always wanted to see. There should be plenty 9f places to plug in your charger. A shop where you can get headphones. Get a book or magazine. Explore what life is like in an airport at this hour.",

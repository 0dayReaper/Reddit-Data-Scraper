I asked Siri to give me an example of a paradox and I got \u201cI always lie\u201d is a paradox. How so? can someone explain this to me",

And if she\u2019s always honest then she can\u2019t lie about lying. There\u2019s no logical way for this statement to be true one way or the other.",

In even more simpler terms, a paradox is something that is true and false *at the same time.* Since true and false are opposites, it is logically impossible for both to occur at once, but in a paradox, that's what happens.\n\nThe most famous paradox is \"this statement is false.\" Let's say I accept the statement as true. In doing so, the statement has to be assumed false. It is true and false. Let's say I reject the statement and assume it is false. If I assume it is false, then the statement is actually true. It is false and true. Something cannot be true and false, or false and true, so a paradox occurs.",

Then it's a paradox.\n\nSo when you say \"I always lie\", if that's true, that means you are saying the truth when you say \"I always lie\". So it's not a lie. So you don't always lie. So it's a valid paradox.\n\nMost paradox are just more or less disguised version of that same one. Like Pinocchio saying \"my nose will grow now\". If it's true, then it's false, and conversely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe word \"paradox\" is also used for time travel scenario, for a similar idea. It's when going back in time prevents the conditions that made it possible for that person to go back in time. You get a loop of causality that can't be solved. The most famous example of that would be \"Some guy goes back in time and kill their grandfather. So their grandfather doesn't have childs. So the guy is never born, and cannot kill the grandfather.\"",

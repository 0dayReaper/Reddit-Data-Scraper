It's so gross! \n\nI'm Japanese and I always cringe when I see this.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI have learned today that people don't like it when I ask why they do things. I have had multiple people message me telling me to fuck off and to leave their country alone.\n\nApologise if I worded it aggressively or something. I really was just genuinely curious. ",

In Canada we always take off our shoes so as not to track dirt and mud around the house.  It's not a hard cultural rule like it is in Japan, but more of a practical necessity.  It's also common to have a different pair of shoes in the office, than the boots that you are wearing walking around outside.",

It actually instilled habits of not eating \"unconsciously\", for example during a movie or on the computer. I tend to only eat when I'm supposed to, not out of boredom or just because. I still rarely eat outside of the kitchen. Even now that I've been on my own for years. And strangely enough I think I'm healthier because if it. I get than some might call that a lifestyle cost, but rules like that also have benefits other than cleaner carpets. Personally I think the lifestyle cost is pretty minimal.",

I find that conscientious guests (when entering a house with fairly clean looking floors) often ask about the homeowners preference for shoes when they come in the door, especially if you see a shoe spot when you walk in, or your host is barefoot. Unless they're just stopping in briefly (like to pick someone up), then shoes stay on. \n\nThe shoe interaction is usually just a \"Um, should I...\", followed by a vague wave at feet, and then, \"oh, don't worry about that\" or \"if you wouldn't mind!\"\n\nI guess if the place is kinda gross you don't ask- that would probably be kind of rude or odd. Might even seem stuck up. You just wear shoes.\n\nPersonally, I don't expect people to take off their shoes in my house. I've got a dog and cat, old splintery floors, and I don't have time to clean as often as I'd like. Really dirty/muddy/wet shoes stay by the door, but on an average day it is normal for everyone to wear their shoes (or not) as they wish.",

In Italy 90% of the houses have tiles, tiles are easy to clean and don\u2019t get ruined, so if you have guest over or you go to someone\u2019s house you wouldn\u2019t take your shoes off and you wouldn\u2019t ask them to take their shoes off. \n\nWhen we are in our own house we wear slippers, and obviously before you get in you clean your shoes on the mat outside of the house. Then you get in with your shoes, go to your room or any room that has a shoes rack, take off your shoes and put slippers on. \n\nWith a swipe and a mop you clean tiles easily and quickly. Much more hygienic than having carpet. Now that I live in the uk my house has carpets flooring and I hate it. Even if you don\u2019t walk with your shoes on the carpet it still won\u2019t be - ever!- as clean as having tiles on the floor. ",

I have two dogs and there is no way that they track in more dirt than shoes would. Paws have a much smaller surface area than shoes generally, and they're not like shoes that get dirt, rocks, snow and shit stuck in the cracks that fall out as you walk. I clean my entire house once a week, and the areas near the front door and the mudroom are consistently the dirtiest parts of the house by far, not where the dogs come back in from going outside. \n\nIf my whole family wore our outside shoes indoors, the whole house would look like shit with dirt and rocks everywhere. I could understand having shoes specifically to wear around the house and then never going outside with them, but wearing your normal shoes indoors is gross. If your floors are too gross for you to walk around barefoot or with socks on, I think you need to clean your floors better or stop dirtying it up so fast with your dirty shoes.",

Please don't hate me.\n\nFirst, \"I hate dogs\" is an exaggeration. I don't wish any harm on dogs and I think most of them are cute. That being said, here's what I do hate:\n \n* I hate being licked and drooled on by dogs. If someone's child walked up to me in a park and licked me, anyone would be grossed out. But if your dog does it, I have to smile and pretend it's okay. Even though I've seen way more dogs eat shit than I have children. I think it's disgusting.\n* I hate the constant noise that many dogs make. I know it's not all of them, but most of the dogs I or my friends have owned constantly bark like crazy when a guest comes in or something's happening outside. Whether it's my dog barking at someone else, or someone else's dog barking at me, I think it's really annoying.\n* I hate how much attention they require. This is definitely more of a personal preference, but when I'm at home, I want to be able to do what I want to do. I don't want *more* chores. But if you have a dog, you have a responsibility to give them attention all day, and you're kind of at the dog's beck and call in many ways.\n\nBasically, as cute as they are and as fun as they can be at times, the cons heavily outweigh the pros for me and I don't understand why someone would elect to keep them in their house. I'm not hating on you though, hopefully this was insightful.",

Drop a fork or bit of food there, do you keep it because you know your floors are perfectly sanitary?\n\nIt's the same with toilet flushing here on Reddit.

People don't purposely track dirt into someone's home. \n\nAs another noted, we eat off higher tables than some and our beds and furniture are also high off the floor. \n\nWe also have large dogs that bring ground matter into the home. I would not trade the love of our family pets for a bit of dirt because we zsweep and vacuum regularly. \n\nI do think it's a good idea to remove shoes, and to each their own if that's important to you. We do if it's muddy or obviously dirtier than usual, but just general ground matter can be mostly \"stomped off\" at the door mat.\n\nThis discussion is no different than asking why all Americans don't use bidets, why do we \"smear the feces in...instead of washing it with a bidet.\" ",

Often times people only care if they just freshly cleaned the carpet.\n\nIt would make sense that in Japan it would be customary to remove footwear upon entry into the house as floor space is utilized as sitting space (with low tables designed for floor sitting even) and beds are often mats that are directly on the floor. You wouldn\u2019t want to spend your recreational and resting time in filth you tracked in from outside.",

Ok, in warmer weather I wear sandals most of the time and my shoes come off almost immediately when I come inside.\n\nIn colder weather though, I leave my shoes ON inside until I'm ready to sit down and relax. I have hardwood floors so they can be chilly, but honestly, until I'm ready to stop running around, I don't even think about removing my shoes.\n\nIf I'm home all day, I wouldn't bother putting shoes on at all though, just going barefoot or wearing socks.\n\nIf I go to someone else's home, I would not take my shoes OFF unless they mentioned it because that seems a little too informal and disrespectful. Maybe it's silly but I feel like showing my socks to people I hardly know is a bit too casual?\n\nI should add, I work in a professional environment. If I wear shoes somewhere that gets them dirty like hiking, strawberry picking etc, the shoes would come off as soon as I walked in the door so as not to spread dirt all over the house. I think that is common of most people who have shoes used in a more utilitarian way.\n\nI've never heard of a single person who wears shoes in bed and it's generally considered seriously rude to put shoed feet on couches or beds.",

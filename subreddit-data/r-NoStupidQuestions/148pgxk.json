So I have around 15% percent in the bag already. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how it works, so what percent would I need to get in the written exam to pass history?. For our exams only 6 of 7 subjects get counted in our  points total, so I probably won\u2019t even count history, but I still don\u2019t want to fail.",

Specifically, your grades thus far on your homework, attendance, quizzes, etc., how each factors into your final grade, and what % counts as a passing grade in this class.\n\nLook at the course's syllabus, it should lay out how the grading structure works.\n\nThere are also tools you can find online that take all this information and calculate the grade you need on the exam to pass the class.",

So I have around 15% percent in the bag already.\n\nThat means if you get 100% on the final you'll get a 95% in the class. It also means if you get 0% on the final you'll get a 15% in the class.\n\nIn other words, every additional 10% you get on the final results in an additional 8% added to your final grade. This boils down to the equation **y = 15 + 0.8x**, where **x** = the percent you get on your exam, and **y** = your final grade as a result.\n\nSo if you score a 70% on the final, you'll get **15 + 0.8(70)** = **15 + 56** = 71% in the class.\n\nIf you got a score other than 15 points on your project, replace 15 in the equation with your actual project score out of 20.",

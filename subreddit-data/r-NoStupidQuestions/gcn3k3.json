It takes a couple of hours for my brain and body to get up to full speed after I wake up.  But I've found that I am more clear-headed at night in general, and do my absolute best work between 1-3 am.  \n\nI have tried a schedule of getting up relatively early (6am) every day for several months, and it was miserable.  I got way less work done, and I just felt exhausted all the time and had to go to bed early to mitigate that.  Then I shifted back to a later schedule and everything was better.\n\nIf I remember correctly, there has been some research that indicates genetic predispositions toward certain sleep patterns, and that people perform better at just about everything when operating according to their natural inclinations.  (I don't remember where I read that, but I'll link it here when I find it.)",

I'm usually a night owl, going to bed around 2 am but with work im usually getting up at 7 am. I want try getting up at 6 am everyday but that requires me to go to bed at 10 or 11 pm, latest. Getting back into a circadian rhythm will be the hardest part, but I find when I can get 7-8 hours of sleep in a night, I feel pretty good the next day. I guess what I'm trying to ask is do you think you were miserable/tired because of the early mornings? Or because you weren't going to bed early enough in the evening to get adequate sleep?",

I started skipping breakfast then pretty quickly started skipping lunch too. I got used to it pretty quick, just eating a snack around 4pm, then a nice big usually home cooked healthier meal for dinner, then nothing after 9.\n\nIt's been well over a year now and I'm still doing it, not because of weight anymore, but just because it's legitimately made my days better. It's convenient. I don't even think about food until afternoon. I don't mind spending the time to make a bigger or nicer meal for dinner since I dont have to spend any time on breakfast or lunch. Probably also saves a decent chunk of money. \n\nI've been able to focus a lot more in the mornings, then take a walk or bike ride at lunch. I'm way less tired, too. I'm not the type of person who is super strict about it though, if someone invites me to lunch, I'll go, but I'll just order something smaller since I'm never hungry around lunch time anymore.",

Before I started I usually ate a pretty light breakfast anyway - yogurt or a smoothie or something. So that was pretty easy for me to just stop. \n\nLunch was a little harder, but I got used to it fairly quick - probably a week after I started. But again, I didn't stop abruptly. So for example if I normally ate a sandwich for lunch at noon, I would switch that to a salad for a few days, then a smaller salad later in the day, then just completely skip it. The most annoying thing was honestly probably the sounds my stomach made some days. I didn't physically feel hungry or tired or anything, but holy crap my stomach would not be quiet.\n\nVery very infrequently I do have days where I'll start to feel really tired early afternoon. Those days I just understand it's probably hunger, and I'll eat a small snack for some energy, which always seems to work.\n\nI work out casually. I don't have any set routine, but most days I try to do some stretches, push ups, curl ups, etc on a yoga mat in my living room. Probably on average 4 days a week I go for a bike bike ride - random length and random location, usually just until I get bored or have to be back at my house to work. Usually last about ~7 miles. I don't think the low intake affects any of that - if anything it seems like the opposite. In the past I would start losing focus around lunch time until I would eat - even if I wasn't hungry. That still happens, but now instead of eating, that's when I normally go for a bike ride, and it makes me feel so much better and refocused.\n\n\nOne part that can be challenging is living with someone who isn't doing it. My girlfriend isn't, which is fine during the weekday since she's at work when I'm skipping meals anyway, but it does make it harder to be consistent on weekends because so many things with friends revolve around food. I also like cooking, so often I'll cook something for breakfast or lunch just for her.",

Some people do it naturally, some people can learn, and some people (like me and likely you) just can't do it at all.  \n\nSure, you can set an alarm to wake you up at 5am, and you can learn to not immediately fall back asleep, but it will probably never be easy or enjoyable.  People told me \"you'll get used to it\" when I switched from working in the service industry, going to bed at 4AM, waking up at noon, to working in an office, going to bed at 11PM, waking up at 7. That was over 10 years ago and it's still just as miserable now as it was the first day.  \n\nYou can't beat biology. The only thing to do is deal with it now, and put work in to find a job that has better or more flexible hours.",

My dad passed away very suddenly, and my mom couldn't cope on her own. I was living in a different city, so I quit my job and moved back home. While I was looking for a new job, my ex boss asked me to help them out as a freelancer, and some of my clients also came with me. So I started freelancing. A few months in someone advised me to register a company to avoid getting in trouble with the tax man, so I did that. 13 Years later, I'm still looking for a job and freelancing hehehe. No just kidding, I'm pretty well established with a good client foundation, but, the whole thing completely came out of the blue. So perhaps you can start by doing small freelance jobs to build up your portfolio?",

And major worries hang over the state of the pandemic, what's happening to money, and other news. Distractions come in the form of sleeping or games. Reddit notifications also help, like this one came right when I was thinking of going back to the document.\n\nI feel the only way to get out of this is to let your thoughts flow, and every half an hour or so remind yourself what you have to get done. Break it into very small pieces and get one piece done each time you sit. One thing at a time.",

But more critically, depression seems to be really creeping back in. I'm self destructing and isolating myself. I still shower at least, my diet is good but last couple days I've been under eating a lot...\n\nAnd I just think it all comes from so many of my anxieties. Whether they be about my lack of a social life, or my inability to do basic adult functions. My to-do list keeps getting put off, and that's not counting the things I'm not even putting on there\n\nI've got a second appointment with my therapist next week but... Honestly I'm doubtful she can help me. I've been to others before, but I feel like she isn't going to help me get myself out of this.\n\nSo quarantine will end, I'll be stuck in the same place with the same problems, although probably worse. My social life will continue to suck. Others will get on with their lives, go out with friends, network...\n\nOh and my family really sucks too, or what's left of them. But they're far away anyways. I realize my support network is terrible and has been for a while. With no idea on how to improve it. I naturally isolate myself anyways. Yay fucked up upbringings. I've spent thousands in therapy at this point, so much on medications that haven't worked (that and I really don't like medications for it)\n\nMy mom is retired now but I barely hear from her. She sort of tries sometimes but most of the time is really unhelpful. Mostly just talks about herself. I'm starting to resent her more and more, as I'm left here from the problems of her raising me, neglecting me and emotionally abusing me. Although I still feel like calling it that is too extreme because she does try to do good things for me, sometimes. But I was taught to repress my emotions, how dare a boy cry\n\nIf they would've just opened their damn eyes they'd see I was really struggling, didn't have friends, and was packed full of terrifying anxiety.\n\nI have good times and bad times, but I feel like the good times are just when I'm unaware of my issues and not doing anything to address them. The bad times are when I'm aware of them and all of my flaws and realizing I'm not going anywhere with them\n\nIt feels very alone...\n\nI want to give up. The last week I've really been looking forward to death. It would be really nice. This intense emotional pain is something many will never know",

I've not been in your place, but a few of my friends I know have similar issues (socially isolated, family issues, feelings of unwanted-ness and worthlessness). All I can say is this - you've been strong your entire life and you have spent your life holding yourself through. Not for the scores of souls around you, focus only on yourself on how you've got here so far, and how you yourself will be able to carry yourself forward as well. \nI wish you find the strength within you to hold yourself together, and then find the energy to lead your life through this crisis. Godspeed to you.\nAwareness of issues are the first step to resolving them. Don't keep stuff in your head, it only builds up the pressure. Let it got, preferably over a paper than a digital medium, and take a good sleep. Wake up, read through and spend each day focusing on improving some aspects - self worth, socialising, family time, etc - and it's okay to not make it on the first attempt. Keep your list open, and give yourself the credit you deserve for trying. All the best to you.",

I think that the day is ruined, and therefore not worth investing in, if I don\u2019t \u201cstart\u201d it by a certain time. A lot of it is about being mindful of your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nFor example, if I say I\u2019m going to start working at 8 but lose track of time until 8:04, I consciously tell myself that I **don\u2019t** have to wait until 9 to get started. I can still accomplish things if they\u2019re not done \u201cperfectly.\u201d I remind myself that getting a few things done at all is better than getting nothing done.\n\nI also plan my entire day out the night before. What time I\u2019m going to work out, shower, eat, work, etc. and a list of things I need to do for work. I rarely stick to the schedule minute-to-minute, which again challenges my black and white thinking, but it helps me get started in the morning when I know exactly what I want to do. I have ADHD and overthink things a lot, so not having too much \u201cunstructured time\u201d is also a good thing for me lol\n\nHope this helps!",

Is it easy for you to lose 7 hours to tv/gaming/content every day? Probably need to balance that shit out.",

The study that it was based off of asked student to time themselves and stop the timer as soon as they felt they were having trouble understanding the information. Basically as soon as you just can\u2019t do the work or task anymore, take a 5 minute break. Go on Reddit or grab a snack or something. And then go back to it. And then at the end reward yourself with something big like playing video games or watching YouTube for hours or smt lol. If anyone cares then I can try to find the video and link it but yeah. It helps me stay more productive and I thought I would right this on the off chance it will help someone even a little bit.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s reading this. I hope you have a nice day :D",

Then break it down to 5 minute tasks. \nAnd try to do 5 minutes, something fun, then another 5 minutes.\nThat was a method that really helped me get started, hope it will help you as well!",

Now with no work, I wake up late, and up to about 1am I become more and more productive throughout the day. It's a shit feeling if the day feels wasted, but also all  you have to do to get rid of that feeling is do something. And if that means doing laundry at 11.30pm, or making your bed right before you get back in to it, so be it. I mean, if there was ever a time where it's okay to do nothing for a few hours on end, it's right now.",

Stop listening to your brain, stop calculating the hours, stop reviewing your day, because these will stress you out. There's an hour left, so you might as well get some shit done because, why the fuck not?",

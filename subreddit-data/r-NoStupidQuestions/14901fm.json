            "comment": "&gt;as the wheels spin it builds electricity to recharge?\n\nThere's one key problem with this. Anything you do to generate electricity from the spinning wheels is going to make them spin slower. If you just spent a bunch of energy making the wheels spin, adding a step that slows them down might be very counter-productive. \n\nIf you already want the wheels to slow down, that's less of a problem. Some cars activate a system called regenerative braking, which gathers energy from the wheels while you are braking.",

Furthermore, if you start taking that energy from the spinning wheels you are effectually braking the car, eventually stopping it.\n\nWhy on earth would you think electric cars were perpetual motion machines by accident?",

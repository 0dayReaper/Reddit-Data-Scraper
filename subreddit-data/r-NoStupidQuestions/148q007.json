    "postText": "I was hanging out today and asked this girl I know if she wanted to hang for a bit. She said she\u2019ll come if she can. That\u2019s fine and dandy by me as it was spur of the moment and sudden. Next thing I know she says she can\u2019t and adds this \ud83e\udee5 emoji to the message as she\u2019s apologizing for not being able to hang out. I figured it\u2019s fine considering it\u2019s raining bad now so I\u2019m not too bummed about it. But the emoji is unknown to me as I don\u2019t know what that is suppose to signify. It confuses me. What does that emoji mean?",

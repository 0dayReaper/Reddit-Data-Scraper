The  best option is to open a blank PowerPoint  slideshow. Adjust the slide sizes to legal size. You can paste the pictures you snipped or drag and drop into the slide. PowerPoint keeps the picture quality even when you adjust sizes. After putting the pictures together you can add text snip the pictures and save as jpegs or better yet .png files. PNG files are better quality if you adjust sizes in other programs.",

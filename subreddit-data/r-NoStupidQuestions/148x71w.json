    "postText": "Gotta get something asap. I'm using a really old set of clippers that doesn't work very well. I'd prefer to use one tool, but it seems like the good head shavers are circular blade designs, and the good face shavers (for odd shapes of the neck and under nose areas) are foil blade desings...  \n\n\nThank you all for sharing",

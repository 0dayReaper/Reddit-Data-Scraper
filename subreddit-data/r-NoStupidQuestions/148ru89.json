I remember being genuinely shocked the first time I saw in a furniture store window a Sega Dreamcast running some football game. I didn't immediately realize it was a video game. Today, you could only really tell the difference between different generations if you had one running right next to the other.",

                            "comment": "Disagree. I am 36 and have been watching games for over 30 of those years. I have seen the bar raised many times. The cutscenes in FF7 blew my damn mind, like jaw dropping. That is just one of the more memorable instances I can think of. I would say the leaps have gotten smaller over time, but still noticeable. As far as console gaming, this current gen is the first gen that doesn't really feel like a full notch above the previous. Maybe I would feel it more if I went back to the xbox one, but the step up didn't feel as profound as say, going from regular xbox to 360, or from 360 to xbox one. But I can tell you that in the early 90s I was tearing it up on my sega master system 2. Went to a friends house and booted up mortal kombat on his genesis and couldn't believe it. I remember my friend renting an original playstation right when they came out from a local hollywood video. We rented one game to play over the weekend for his birthday/slumber party. It was this game that was just called D. The graphics and the sound track created this atmosphere that was more horrifying and immersive compared to anything we had ever seen before. You can look at footage now of a game like that and think it looks like shit, but it is hard to explain what it was like when you saw it that first time back in 1995. I played it again nearly 20 years later because of this crazy memory I have of playing it when it first came out and holy shit it plays and looks terrible. Compared to my memory of playing it when it was brand new and pushing the boundaries of what was possible with 3d graphics, there is this major disjointed impression in my head. \n\nThere are a few xbox games that left a mark on me. I remember for the 360 there was the game Dantes Inferno, holy hell that game looked impressive when it came out. It probably still holds up to this day. Another game I played was Ryse son of rome on xbox one. It is still some of the best graphics I have ever seen in a game. Another game that impressed me at the time it came out was titanfall 2. I remember thinking most new games didn't look that much better than 360 games, but then you play a game like titan fall 2 and it's like, oh yea I guess I can notice a change here.\n\nSo as far as your impression where you don't notice a change, it is hard to say what frame of reference you are looking from. For me, starting with 80s segas and ataris, the changes have been quite noticeable at certain stages, but I can say that recently there is not much improvement year to year. I played Diablo 2 when it first came out and watched those cutescenes, I remember thinking it looked so realistic that it made old nintendo games look prehistoric, but you watch those cutscenes now and they don't look realistic at all. At the time it just felt so photo realistic that the impression stays in my head all these years later, but if i watch those cutscenes now they look pretty silly. All i can say is I get what you are saying, but it does not line up with my own experiences. And beyond video game performance, you have just the platforms to consider. I remember trying to decide between ps2 and regular xbox. I went with the xbox because it had a hard drive big enough to rip all my cds onto. It felt straight out of the future at the time to be able to listen to your own music while playing a game. the graphics felt amazing compared to my n64, incomparably better, but I just remember being most impressed with how absolutely massively huge the hard drive was at like 8gb. Just a side note, I remember convincing my parents to buy our first ever dvd player when they first dropped the price of a new one to 300 bucks. I just remember it felt like time traveling 100 years into the future, but you think of dvds now and they seem pretty lame.",

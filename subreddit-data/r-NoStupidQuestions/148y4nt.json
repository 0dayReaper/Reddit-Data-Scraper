            "comment": "\"Meaning\" is a concept invented by people to frame discussion about why we do the things we do. There is no one single \"meaning of life;\" rather, an individual life acquires meaning when a person makes impactful decisions about what to do with their time and effort. Meaning is not a predetermined mission that comes with your life when you're born; meaning is about what you choose to do with your life.",

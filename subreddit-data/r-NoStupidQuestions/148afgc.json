            "comment": "It has to be a crime that the constitution allows the death penalty for, which the Supreme Court has limited to pretty much just murder and crimes against the state. State or federal law has to authorize it for that crime (many states have abolished it). And the jury has to approve the death penalty, separately from deciding the defendant was guilty; besides the evidence of the crime they get to hear about aggravating or mitigating factors that might suggest greater or lesser punishment is deserved.\n\nUsually prosecutors seek the death penalty for repeat or multiple killers or if the murder was especially cruel (which is largely a matter of the prosecutor's judgment). It can be political too, with public pressure to seek the death penalty for crimes that became infamous, while on the other hand some prosecutors avoid seeking it at all because they say they're against it. It's common for prosecutors to offer to seek a life sentence instead if the defendant will plead guilty. Because a lot depends on the culture of the prosecutor and jury, there are big differences between states in how often people are sentenced to death, without necessarily any legal difference.",

            "comment": "Death penalty cases have two phases: the guilt phase and the penalty phase.  During the guilt phase, the prosecution and defense present their evidence to support a guilty or not guilty verdict.  If the defendant is found guilty of murder, the case moves on to the penalty phase, and more evidence is presented to support arguments for and against the death penalty.  In every state, there is a statute that has two lists: mitigating factors and aggravating factors.  The mitigating factors are basically arguments in favor of life in prison rather than the death penalty.  The aggravating factors are arguments in favor of the death penalty.  One of the most common aggravating factors is that the person who was murdered was a police officer acting in the line of duty.  The jury has to review the lists of mitigating and aggravating factors and determine which ones have been proven during the penalty phase, and how much weight to give each factor.  If they feel that the mitigating factors carry more weight than the aggravating factors, they must sentence the defendant to life.  If they find that the aggravating factors do, they must sentence him to death.\n\nThere is also a federal death penalty, and it has its own statute with its own mitigating and aggravating factors.",

    "postText": "I accidentally searched something illegal. \n\nI feel absolutely sick to my stomach with anxiety, I was searching for this video on PH that I found earlier and couldn\u2019t remember the name of it.\n\nIt was an older video and so in a moment of absolutely stupidity I searched up the age of the video and the contents and instantly realized what I had done, the warning popped up and I closed it automatically. I didn\u2019t even get to read the warning so I have no clue what it said and if it would\u2019ve told me I was flagged or something. \n\nI\u2019ve never done this before and I feel so anxious about it, I cannot believe I did that. I don\u2019t want to get into trouble or anyone to find out through our internet provider but will we get a notice about it? Or will I get a visit? Or am I overthinking? \n\nThank you I know this was a super stupid mistake.",

I've seen that warning too (can't remember what I searched for but it was similar to your story, where I just didn't fully think about what it could mean) and had the \"quickly close the window and wait for the police to arrive\" moment.. felt like an idiot. Just be careful what you're searching for in future lol.\n\nEdit for typo.",

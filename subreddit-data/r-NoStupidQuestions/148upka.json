I often find myself swiping left on people I would be interested in because I don\u2019t think I have any chance due to mental health issues I currently have and lack of confidence.\n\nIt had me wondering if this was a common thing people do on these apps or if I\u2019m kinda being stupid here?",

You don't get unlimited swipes unless you pay for the premium service, so you don't want to waste your swipes on people who are way out of your league and you know there's no chance you're going to get with.\n\nAlso sometimes the most attractive accounts on the apps are just bots/scammers using pictures of fashion models they swiped from the Internet. You can tell because they usually only have one photo, and their bio is very generic. So you definitely don't want to waste a swipe on them.",

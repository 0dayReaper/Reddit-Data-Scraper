First time I gave him a ride I told him the rule. At first he was like, \"really?\". \n\nHe believed me when I parked my car in the.middle of the street and sat there. He remembers now and doesn't grumble. \n\nI'm not having someone die in my car if we crash.",

No breaking, no evasive effort from him at all either.  The head of my wife in the passenger seat hit me full in the chest, cracking ribs on my right side. And knocking her out cold for a minute or two and well a concussion. I also slammed into the door, cracking ribs on the my left side as well. The next weeks were hell to even breathe. I went without sleep many a night.\n\n3 point seatbelts: well we still had them on properly afterwards, but they allow you to move a lot sideways. Being tightly strapped down with 5 point seat belts (like in race cars) would have helped a lot more, but let's be honest those are a PITA to get on compared to what people need to do with the simpler stuff in regular cars.\n\nThe seatbelts however are essential for airbags to work.",

I couldn't invite her anywhere after that. All I can think about is no matter where I invited her to, either to my home or to somewhere else, she would be traveling with herself and or her children all without seatbelts on. I kept feeling like I couldn't have it on my conscience to invite her somewhere to drive in her car knowing she wasn't going to put her seatbelt on. The relationship simply slowly died out because I couldn't initiate any outings and I couldn't, in good conscious, except invitations anywhere with them. I liked her, and her family, and knowingly putting them In Harm's Way for my own benefit was something I couldn't handle. So if you put your foot down and simply know that you will not get in the car with them and you will not go anywhere where they will put themselves in danger for your sake then the relationship was likely to just dwindle on its own.",

I was tossed around in my vehicle so much and landed sideways in the passenger seat. That experience really cemented how grateful I was I had become a regular seatbelt user, just unlucky that I hadn't gotten mine on yet.\n\nFortunately my actual injuries were very minor. A minor nose fracture and a gash on my nose that barely didn't need stitches from my glasses (those miraculously survived, too lol). The whiplash was honestly the worst. For a few days, starting the 2nd day after the accident, I couldn't get up or lie down in bed without supporting my head with my hands because my neck muscles hurt too much.",

Completely up to you as to whether you give up on her as a friend or not, but I find that people with this sort of mindset tend to forgo other basic safety standards as well. Like, we have safety rules and standards for a reason- and it doesn't just impact her, it impacts others in her vicinity as well. It's selfish behaviour tbh. And, like, wearing a seatbelt is so easy and simple. There's no excuse for not wearing one",

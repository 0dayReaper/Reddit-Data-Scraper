            "comment": "Pretty much everything is smaller in Japan than in the west. There are various reasons for that, but some are likely to do with preference, proportionality to the average person, costus, availability of materials in the past, apetite and even conserving space. These factors shift the \"baseline\" of expected size for things. As for food specifically, we westerners in general eat significantly more than we absolutely need to and the Japanese are more strongly pushed to \"optimize\" for all the aforementioned reasons .",

Say your landlord doesn't want you to have a girl visit your apartment, but you would like that very much.  Technically, he owns the property.  Should he make the rules?\n\nNow let's say instead of having a girl over, you want to manufacture explosive devices in the apartment.  Can your landlord say no?  Remember, you said you wanted \"extremists in letting people have freedom.\"\n\nMaybe we should just take these things on a case by case basis over a long period of time, and develop a set of guidance for various situations.  How about that?",

Because of this, some women may find that, after a few hours, their pregnancy test now reads positive. This is why the directions say not to read the results after a certain amount of time.\n\nFor context, hCG levels during pregnancy can range from 25 mIU (when you are determined to be pregnant) to 200,000 mIU.",

If a woman who doesn't want to get pregnant is a day or two late, she's likely to wait a bit in a mix between not overly panicking and burying her head in the sand. A woman keen to get pregnant is likely to go dashing to the store to get one, unable to suppress the waiting. They're selling the idea that this company will be the one to give you this happy news, and that you are somehow partners in this magical process.\n\nAnd now we have tests that can tell you *before* you've even missed a period, sometimes up to 6 days before! But with less accuracy. Imagine a woman buying one of those tests every day during that time (as accuracy steadily increases).",

It's a psychological side of advertising ",

My understanding is that for a lot of couples, it's a lot harder to get pregnant and have a child survive until term than the media and others would lead you to believe. She is very sensitive about it, and I completely understand why. Going so far as to cut off social media because seeing other moms with their kids was making her really emotional on a lot of different levels. (Why isn't that me, What's wrong with me, etc. etc.)\n\nI don't want kids. Ever. So I'd be the one who used the test hoping for a no result. However, beyond that very slim circumstance, I am not watching or caring about pregnancy test commercials. (TBH I'd be more likely to go to a doc for a blood test anyway because that's more reliable.)  People who actually want to have a baby are, because they want fast and accurate results. \n\nWhen I think about my friend who really wants a baby watching a commercial where a person celebrates getting a 'not pregnant' result, I can tell she would be upset. Not angry at the commercial, but moreso, yet again, reminded of how sad her circumstances are and kind of upset that a commercial is reminding her about it while also having a person *celebrating* not being pregnant. \n\nSo it comes down to audience. I'm not watching those commercials as someone who doesn't want a baby, especially because I'm doubly responsible about birth control and would be at a doc in a flash if there were any signs there had been some kind of mishap. My hopeful pregnant-to-be friend is. And they want to advertise to her. And I'm fine with that. ",

Music based around drones is minimalist and focuses on texture, timbre, and in some cases harmonic sonorities, with less focus on rhythm and melody. The drone note or chord, called a \"pedal point\", creates tension as the chords and harmonies change over top of it, leading to temporary dissonance",

            "comment": "You have a fundamental misunderstanding of frequency. A frequency is a rate of vibration, in this case, the vibration of sound, which you as the listener hear as a singular note's pitch. A chord, for example, is comprised of multiple notes, or multiple frequencies. Your original question is how you can find the frequency of a song, but what you're actually looking for is the tuning of a song. To simplify things a little, you can use a tuning app on your phone for that (in conjunction with some math that not even I wanna do), but better yet, I can tell you that the music at certain frequency shit is all pseudoscience.  \n\n\nLike was said, frequency's use in music is for tuning. For years, tuning has been anywhere in the ballpark of A4=432hz and A4=440hz and eventually got standardized at the latter for convenience's sake, though plenty of other tunings have been used. The other use is to sell people on vague things they don't understand, ie. people like to claim that tuning A4 to 432hz is more 'attuned to nature'. Now, I'm not one to knock someone for their beliefs, but when I read that last sentence I can't help but think of how much of a crock of shit that sounds like. Something might be more pleasant to your ears - a lot of people have a lot of different perceptions and ideas of pleasant. Point is, if you find soothing music soothing, then listen to soothing music. No special type of tuning for music is gonna make you resonate with the earth and unlock the frequency of immortality and good health.  \n\n\nTheres plenty more that you can go into, like temperament in tuning systems like our standard 12 tone equal temperament or even how different cultures use different systems altogether, like a 7 or 5 tone system, but im tired of typing and you're probably tired of reading",

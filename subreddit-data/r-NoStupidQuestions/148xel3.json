            "comment": "I'm not a Christian, but the story of Job is about what it means to worship God through hard times. It's a mythic poem, not meant to be taken as a literal historical account, considering the question of why bad things happen to good people. It discusses possible answers like \"God is actually unjust\" and \"bad things *don't* really happen to good people; those people were secretly bad and deserved it\", but ultimately rejects those ideas as being oversimplifications. The answer in the end is more like, \"We can't know the mind of God and thus can't know why we suffer, but suffering can still be an opportunity to draw closer to God and experience a revelation of divine wisdom.\"\n\nIn other words, the fact that it isn't explained is part of the point of the story. Humans aren't meant to know God well enough to have a coherent explanation for all the suffering that we experience, and we should understand that there are more important things in life than avoiding suffering.",

                    "comment": "I would argue that this is why it's a terrible story: it totally *does* explain the reason for the suffering. The whole 'why' being debated for the whole book is spelled out in the first chapter.  It *was* simply a bet, with no consequences over outcome but pride. Even the Duke Brothers put $1 on the line before going nuclear against their most devoted for fun.\n\nIt's a story that passionately argues against its own revelations. It admonishes its reader for daring to judge, while also providing a omnipotent perspective and information the characters in the story lack. I sometimes wonder if the whole tale is a misunderstood work of bitter satire. The end of Job seems like a rushed end of a sardonic comedy (oh don't worry, all was well, much ado about nothing!) and everyone is happy except the innocent dead struck down over a game. What a weird book to enshrine in religious canon.",

This was being written at a time where the idea that \"actually he must have done something to deserve all this\" would have seemed like the obvious answer, and the story couldn't effectively explore the question it was intending to explore if people automatically assumed the worst of Job. We need to be told from a \"God's eye view\" that he actually is blameless and his suffering is not his fault, so the easy out is taken away from us and we are left to grapple with the messier, more challenging reality.\n\nEDIT: Just saw the text you edited in. I think you're probably close to correct about it being satire. My understanding is that the basic myth of a righteous man's piety being tested by Satan, him passing the test, and having the suffering undone by God, is something that already existed in Israelite culture predating the Book of Job. The writer of Job presumably heard this story being passed around uncritically, thought, \"Well that's fucked up\", and then wrote a story where the righteous man gets to have a voice and try to understand what is happening to him and argue his case to the people who naturally assume the worst of him. It is surprising to me too that it ended up in the canon for how countercultural it must have been at the time, but I think it made the cut because it calls attention to the undeniable problem at the core of all theology and explores it in a compelling way without being *too* blasphemous.",

This is famously called the problem of evil.\n\nYou just kinda have to ignore it when reading the bible, because if you keep those details in mind none of the things he does makes any sense.\n\nSome christians get around this by understanding the stories to be parables and not literally true, and that in reality god is mysterious.\n\nOthers justify it by saying that whatever god does is good by definition, no matter how wicked it may seem to us.\n\nI've also heard some say that god's power over us is so absolute that it doesn't matter what he does to us.\n\nBasically, you've discovered a real and ongoing problem of biblical literalism and lots of people have their personal excuses for it, but there is no consensus.",

The idea of god as a perfectly good being with perfect knowledge of the future and aperfect love for humans was really kind of a morph as Judaism encountered Babylonians and later the Greeks.\n\nGod of most of the old testament is much more similar to the god of other religions, who have their favorites, who have their limitations, and who have their weakneses.\n\nThe book of Job is a atory that helps people understand suffering, to be taught to love god even through suffering and that there will be a reward if you do (as long as you are the man that is the main character and not the wofe or children).\n\nThere wasn't a need for a bigger narrative about how this jives with an all perfect, all knowing god because that wasn't the god moat hebrews worshipped at the time.",

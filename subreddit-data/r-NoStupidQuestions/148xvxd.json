If you feed it with a steady diet of porn, you can train your brain and your penis to only get excited by the visual effects of porn. \n\nThen, you also have a series of fantasy porn video scenarios in your brain. If the actual real life sex doesn\u2019t match the fantasy, your brain and penis don\u2019t respond. \n\nThis is the same issue with the \u201cdeath grip\u201d.  Your penis and your brain get used to only your hand for stimulation and orgasm. So any other sensations ( no matter how pleasurable they should be) do not excite your penis like your own hand.",

A and B represent total testosterone levels and free testosterone, tested via saliva and blood. C is cortisol, and D/E/F represent ratios of these three. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nqd98m5\n\nYou'll note that in all three cases testosterone returns to the level it was at. In every fucking case. Free testosterone initially dips, then rises ABOVE pre-masturbation levels before normalizing. Hell, without porn there is a much more pronounced curve in testosterone response! Porn levels it off.\n\nSo no. Why you would imagine this has short or even long-term consequences to testosterone levels is beyond me.",

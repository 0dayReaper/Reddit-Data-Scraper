I did not understand the meaning of it and reacted badly.\n\n8 years later it still sits on my dresser as a reminder to think before speaking. I hurt her feelings and that always bothers me.",

My sister and I usually had like lots of little cheap presents, and then one big surprise present. \n\nIt's worth mentioning my sister was always mega cute and sweet until this point, and that probably made the wound deeper. \n\nWe opened our big surprise present and it was \u00a350 vouchers. I got one for a game store, she got one for a book store (She was an avid reader). \n\nWhat my sister said next will always bother me \"What's the point in these? I'll just read on my kindle anyway. What a waste\". \n\nI felt sick, I hated this moment, I couldn't believe something so nasty could come out of my sister's mouth. My mum started to stutter as if trying to conjure an apology, my sister was only 10 and had never been ungrateful for anything to this point. \n\nMy mum left the room while choking up the words \"Merry Christmas everyone!\" before I found her crying over many instances over the next few days, hearing phone conversations where she'd call herself a failure. \n\nIf someone gets you something, be grateful, no matter what. Even if the present does suck, in that moment when you receive it, give them the benefit of the doubt and accept that there is a reason why the bought it for you, and be grateful you've got someone who put in effort at all, because a lot of people don't.",

Also make sure you\u2019re doing your fair share of the household chores, even if your wife says it\u2019s fine she does more think about how you don\u2019t want your daughter to be a maid for her future partner.\n\nGet comfortable with female terminology, you\u2019re going to need to buy the tampons at some point, you\u2019re gonna need to take her to a drs appt for a UTI, if you want to be there for your daughter don\u2019t limit certain topics to certain parents. Because if she needs someone to talk in that moment and you\u2019re the only one home, guess you gotta sit in the discomfort with her and figure it out, don\u2019t pass it off and say \u201clet\u2019s wait until mom gets home\u201d\n\nI guess in general that\u2019s my advice, you\u2019re in for a lot of strange and new and that naturally can feel uncomfortable, but I guarantee it will feel 10x weirder for the tiny human who learned to tie her shoes yesterday, and there\u2019s nothing more empowering than seeing the adult in her life admit that they don\u2019t know and they make mistakes but let\u2019s figure this out together.",

If they ask about something awkward, don't hedge, just do your best to answer. (My daughter is the queen of awkward questions.) If they ask if they can go somewhere or do something, tell them honestly yes or no or if it's maybe explain the maybe.   (The kids would always ask my ex to do stuff with them and he'd always say maybe later.   It didn't take long before they figured out that maybe later meant no and just stopped asking him to do things.)\n\nAlso, listen to your kids and ask questions.  Let them ask you anything. Ask them about their day.  Ask them what they thought of the movie you just watched, the book they are reading, what they'd like for dinner tomorrow, what they'd like to do over the weekend.  Let them know that you value what they have to say.  \n\nIt seems like little stuff, but it makes a huge difference in the relationship you have with them as they get older.  \n\nMy son is 12 and sometimes asks me if he can tell me something without me getting mad at him.   I always tell him yes, but remind him if it is something truly bad, there may still be consequences, even if I'm not angry.   It's almost always something that seems dreadful to him, but isn't all that bad, and he just needs to talk about.",

Re: unwanted attention/harassment A good way to impart this on your child (of any gender) from an early age, (once they\u2019re past the newborn potato phase) if you want a hug from your child ask if you can give them a hug. Showing them that their body is there\u2019s to choose how to touch or not touch is sooo important. Not only because it instills respect you have for her and her physical comfort but it also teaches her that if any other adult goes in for the hug she\u2019s allowed to say no thank you in a respectful way. A lot of child predatory behavior happens from family members in families where hugs for everyone is expected, and children learn that they can\u2019t say no if an adult is directing the touch.",

Turns out she seems way more into \"masculine\" things?  Great!  If you are too, ask her to help you with fixing the car, projects around the house, etc.  \n\nBasically, ignore gender stereotypes and just be a friend, a teacher, and a parent.

            "comment": "OH, and I just remembered something really really REALLY important. Please read this: \n\nWhen we were little, my dad would play this game with us called \u201cthe claw\u201d. He would pretend to be sleeping on the ground, and we had to get past him without \u201cwaking him up\u201d. If he could hear us he would pretend to be a monster and make monster sounds \ud83d\ude02, and he would grab our arm/ankle/etc, and have his hand in a firm grip. We would be hysterically laughing, and he would say we won the game if we could get out of the claw. It felt impossible as tiny girl and my dad felt like a giant when I was so small, but the trick he taught us was to grab the thumb, twist it and lift it, because that\u2019s the weak spot. And it really worked! We loved this game so much and we would play it all the time.\n\nNow, this is a little heavy, but it\u2019s important. Fast forward to my freshman year of college, and I stepped outside a party to catch some air and cool off. I saw a boy that lived in my dorm, he came over to say hi to me. Him saying hi was really him trying to hook up with me, and when I told him no he didn\u2019t listen. He had me pinned down on the ground and I was yelling. He had my left hand pinned down. Without even thinking about it, I grabbed my right hand and twisted his thumb up so fast, he yelled and released me. At that point some other kids saw us and took care of this asshole\u2026..but\u2026\u2026the claw game really saved me in that moment. I had played it so many times with my dad as a kid, it was in my subconscious as a move you do to get free. \n\nI never told him this story, didn\u2019t want to upset him, but years later I asked him why we played the claw game. And he told me, it was so we could learn to protect ourselves. Tearing up writing this. \n\nPlay the claw game with your daughter \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f",

            "comment": "There\u2019s this clip on youtube of Tony Hawk coaching Sky Brown (who was like 11 at the time) to go down a mega ramp. That shit makes me tear up lol, you gotta watch it. Women\u2019s sports are absolutely taking OFF these days. Young female climbers are obliterating previous records. Snowboarders, skiiers, the list goes on. \n\nBuilding a healthy, athletic base as a child and a teen is so important. And these days there are plenty of role models, but I think it\u2019s so important to coach and encourage kids (especially girls, but obvs boys too) to enjoy and progress safely at what they love. Also the \u201cchasing sage\u201d channel on YT makes me cry because it\u2019s so cute watching them teach their toddler how to snowboard \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nAthleticism is a skill for life. And girls e s p e c i a l l y need to be encouraged and shown that whatever they set their minds to is possible when it comes to sports and using their bodies and strength. But building those skills as a kid is literally life changing. Some of these sports are super pricey, some are more affordable, but you gotta work with what you got available and with what your baby is naturally drawn to. \n\nThat\u2019s a ways down the line, but the single most impactful thing that I\u2019ve experienced in my life as a woman when it comes to male role models and father figures, is being valued equally as my male peers. Not because I\u2019m AS strong in XYZ aspect or skill, but because I am equally capable of accomplishing what I want to learn and do. And to be respected and connected to like that by men has really been a positive force in my life. Especially in jiu jitsu and climbing and also in academic pursuits. \n\nConversely, those experiences where boys in elementary school tried to bully us into accepting that girls suck at everything, especially gameboy lol, and girls dont play _______, aren\u2019t into go-carts, and shit like that\u2026 it cuts VERY deep, especially as a kid. And working jobs where dumb shit would happen like\u2026 at this garden center there was pressure not to **gasp** carry heavy shit that was totally within my range because \u201cthe (adult) boys will do that\u201d \u201coh, let the men do that\u201d\ud83e\udd2e. It\u2019s all really dumb, but social pressure and socialization is a insidious beast that will fuck you up if you\u2019re not careful. \n\nIt will happen at some point, inevitably. Someone or some group or some peer pressure will try to clip your girls wings, out of jealousy or fear or competitiveness or their own abusive upbringing. But if you are always there showing her that she can do whatever, then she will hopefully not be too affected and keep doing what she loves and learning and growing freely and joyfully. \n\nLast thing: question all the double standards between boys and girls. Ones that you see other parents or teachers, or family members parroting, and ones that you might catch yourself doing. Boys are generally encouraged to play a little rougher, be louder, and more active. While girls are generally socialized to be quieter and less active. It\u2019s kind of subconscious. Do your utmost to treat them all equally and like we\u2019re all on the same team here. Fight the power!!!! \n\nCONGRATULATIONS &lt;3\n\nEdit: this just made me remember a formative experience LOL. I was at the highland games in town with my Mom as a small kid, like 9 or 10. And I was pretty in awe of the guys throwing stuff, it was so entertaining, and I thought it was so cool, and I really wanted to try it. My Mom took me up to say hi and ask for a picture with one of the competitors, and he lifted me up and put me on his shoulder and I was like holyyyy shiiiiiiiit real recognizes real LOL. It made me so happy. And then when I was older, like mid twenties, I randomly ran into a highland games champion at a fishing lodge and I half-jokingly asked him if he\u2019d teach me how to throw a caber. AND HE DID. And he was super nerdy and serious about it, which is exactly what I\u2019m like. It\u2019s being accepted like THAT that has always lifted me up so much, literally and metaphorically. God I just love humans beings bros.",

Never call her names unless they're affectionate and she likes them and never curse at her. Always be there when she needs you, regardless of why. You're going to love her more than anything in the world I promise you that. It's been the single most fulfilling feeling in the world as a dad to have raised a great human being for a daughter. We are best friends to this day. She's 24 now and very healthy, happy and independent",

I knew mom wouldn't be able to attend due to her work situation, but my dad had promised me he'd show up. Work kept him and he couldn't. He had flowers sent to me, at school, before the play, with a little note saying he was sorry he couldn't make it. I cannot remember anything else about the play, or my classmates, or even my teacher. But I remember that moment vividly. \n\nAlso- show her how much you love her and help her understand her own worth; doing that will help prevent her from seeking that validation from boys that might not treat her well.",

Don't tell her she's not allowed to date until she's 30. (Also don't assume that her romantic partners will all be male. They might be, they might not be.) \n* Some dads are so eager to be progressive and open about e.g. periods that they forget to think about how their daughter might feel. If **you** are willing to discuss periods with your daughter, good, but accept that **she** might not want to discuss her period with you. Wanting some privacy isn't the same as being ashamed of her body. \n* Many parents fear for their daughter's safety in a way they don't fear for their son's. It's understandable to worry about her safety, but don't approach it as \"I have to guarantee that my daughter will never be sexually assaulted.\" The sad truth is that you cannot guarantee that. What you can do instead is demonstrate that if she tells you she was assaulted, you will believe her and not blame her or audit her behavior to pinpoint where she went \"wrong\" (what was she wearing? how much was she drinking? how late was it? etc.). Also, if you someday find out that she was assaulted and didn't tell you right away (or at all), don't take it personally. \n* You should generally avoid saying \"As a father of daughters...\" unless the end of that sentence is something like \"...I always have extra Girl Scout cookies at the end of the season, so hit me up in April if you want some.\" Otherwise it can come across like the [\"As a Father of Daughters\"](https://the-toast.net/2016/04/18/father-daughters-think-treat-women-like-daughters/) piece on The Toast.\n\nGood luck!

Nothing crazy, just consistent I guess. \n\nBut I must say - 25 years of existence I never once heard this man complain about doing anything for me or my 4 siblings. Not once. I rack my brain every night lately to try to remember just ONE time. He\u2019d work 2 jobs, and still be there to cook and drive and do it with a smile. 4am drop offs to uni so I wouldn\u2019t have to take the train in the dark.

But during the France v Argentina World Cup match he stayed up until 3am watching the game, so we could talk about it in the morning. How is any man supposed to meet that standard now lol? \n\nI played netball. He obviously didn\u2019t. So he would spend hours at the library reading about it so he could help me get better and understand my games. \n\nWait I guess he did do a lot.

Make sure you teach them that no matter what they do or turn out to be, you'll love and support them.\n\nI screw this up like anybody but these are my guiding lights.",

She was too young to fix it and the looks I got were more than enough. 2 weeks later, I perfected the high pony and never looked back!\n\nEdit: Also helps a partner out if you are cross trained in this area!",

Please be thoughtful and considerate, everyone needs privacy, and space. Be strict, but not too strict. And also, I recommend checking phones but when you do, make sure that they know you're only looking for their safety, this same girl we are talking told me that one of her friends told another one of her \"friends\" (they are no longer friends) some really bad stuff about others, none of their parents check their phones so no one will ever know, but it definitely deserves to be punished. Don't use it as a punishment, use it as a safety for her and for her friends. But if she asks you not to check her messages with her boyfriend or something, don't. Have a bit of trust in her, again, privacy. Find a balance. You'll make some mistakes but learn from them.

You are about to embark upon the hardest job you'll ever love.  \n\nSecond,  time goes by much too quickly and will pass so much quicker than you've ever imagines.  Take pictures often.  \n\nMy daughter is about to turn 18 and will enter college this fall. One thing I started doing was to create a journal when we first learned my wife was pregnant.  I add to it at least once a month and try to do more, but it doesn't always happen.  I write her all the things I don't always get a chance to say.   Sometimes it's words of encouragement, sometimes how helpless I feel, and I always remind her how proud I am to be her dad and how much I love her.  I also include special pics and things that happen along the way. \n\nGirls can be very emotional and sometimes you'll get frustrated at how upset they are about something that seems so trivial to you.  Girls don't always want the \"answer\" or the \"fix\" to the problem.  They just want someone to listen and then tell them you're sorry they're heartbroken and that it'll be okay.  \n\nNo boy will ever be good enough for her.  Try to be fair though and don't go overboard telling her how the boy doesn't measure up and how he isn't good enough for her.  It's hard but you've gotta resist.  \n\nAlways try and take time for those small things that could be huge memories later in life.  Doing her hair ... having tea parties .... doing her nails .... reading books together before bed .... etc. \n\nHug and hug often.  One day you'll pick her up and set her down for the last time. You won't know that day when it happens, so keep hugging while you can. It sucks when you realize you've picked her up and held her in your arms for the last time. \n\nEnjoy the ride my friend and don't waste a minute.",

You\u2019ll have amazing days and you\u2019ll have the worst end. Just never forget about tomorrow and the potential it has. As long as you let your love show, you\u2019re good. As a dad we\u2019re expected to be strong, stable, never breaking. That is a lot to hold and no one ever seems to notice. Remember you aren\u2019t alone. My dad is unlike any man I\u2019ve met in that he was always willing to let me see him break down. He just made sure I saw him build himself back up too. That\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget for a thousand reasons. Never be afraid to reach out for help. \nYou got this man, you\u2019re already doing better than most just in that you\u2019re mentally preparing. \nNow buckle up and get ready for the wild ride, 4 years into this roller coaster and my general parent consensus is \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f",

My parents were separated when it hit for me, and I was living with my dad, and the only daughter with 3 brothers. Dad making it easy to talk to him about that stuff really set the stage to be able to talk about anything. \n\nAlso, fun thing my dad did that still makes me have happy tears at 35\u2026 my birthday is near Valentine\u2019s Day, but you can do this no matter when her birthday is\u2026 he would have flowers, a teddy bear and box of chocolate delivered to me anonymously while I was at school. It made me feel really special and loved. He still gives me a little teddy bear every year and I have them on a shelf, it\u2019s a really sweet thing for me. \n\nAlso, one of the absolute biggest things for me. My dad was trying to teach me to read even before I could really talk. I always had a book shelf in my room, and he\u2019d give me gift certificates for the book store as I grew up. I still have some of the children\u2019s and young adult books he bought me. Reading with dad is one of my warmest and fondest memories. And it lead to me being one of those people that reads every night before bed. Not only will it give her good memories, it will undoubtedly help her in the future to be a curious person.",

Even if you think you know brush up on it.\n\nGet real acquainted with the feminine hygiene products aisle in the store.  And while it doesn't sound like it'll be a problem, don't be one of those fuckwits that refuses to get those things.

It shouldn't have to be said but I still see this attitude everywhere.\n\nGoogle about the things girls and young women go through.  Seriously do it.  You'll be so much better prepared.\n\nLearn to teach - kids are voracious learners.  Cooking or cleaning, be prepared to have a helper.\n\nLastly, and they didn't really have this when I became a parent, but there's a YouTube channel called Dad How Do I and it basically teaches all of us things our parents didn't or couldn't.  I'm sure there's something like that for dads who want to be good dads of daughters.\n\nFor me, it was dick kick o'clock 24/7.

My dad never once did this until they were -long- overdue. He (nor my mother for that matter) never once gave me the \"talk\" so I ended up hiding everything from both of them. He halfheartedly asked me if I was being \"safe\" YEARS after I started being sexually active and I lied to him that yes, I was, when no, I wasn't. Maybe if they had shown me they cared instead of setting the pretence of judgement then I would have recognised sooner that the situation I was in was in fact VERY unsafe.\n\nNever talk about her body as a sexual thing. Now this sounds bad but what I mean is, you do not tell her that what she is wearing is \"inappropriate\". No matter what you think. She will face harassment no matter what she wears. All you can do is avoid attributing this harassment towards the clothes she wants to wear. Teach her that it is never her fault. All I heard for years from my dad was \"that's way too short, go and change your clothes\". This taught me 2 things: 1. That my body, the body my parents gave me, was something to be ashamed of and covered up, 2. That my own FATHER will always view his DAUGHTER as a sexual object.\n\nFor when she gets older; she is a human first and your daughter second. I'm 24 now and my dad has made it clear he sees me as HIS daughter instead of my own person. This has caused an unfixable rift between us. I live with my parents still and I literally will go longer than a week without uttering a single WORD to my dad even though we still live in the same house.\n\nTreat her like a human and love her unconditionally despite the choices she will make.

She is figuring out who she is, everything is new and unique and interesting. This little miracle is becoming a person before your eyes. She'll figure out what she does and doesnt like, dont ridicule any of what she tries. You can disapprove without shaming your child. \n\nFor the love of god make sure she knows the proper names of her body parts as early as you can teach her. Heaven forbid anything happen to her, but as a CSA survivor please give her the vocabulary to say what happened if it does. Same goes for any kids you have, doesnt matter their sex.  \n\nAnd discuss consent early in age-appropriate ways. Dont let family force her into hugs and kisses. It should ALWAYS be her choice. Teach her that it is okay to protest loudly when family tries to make her give them a hug. This alone can deter potential abuse from family as she wont \"go along\" with anything, and it helps with building self esteem and self autonomy for her future relationships.  \n\nAnd this one comes from a personal place but its going in here too. Even when she's all grown up, she's still gonna be a little kid on the inside. All of us are, whatever we say otherwise. And no matter how old she gets, that kid is gonna need her parents.   \n\nThis wont apply for a time yet, but i feel its applicable at just about every age.  \nIf she's ever crying over something you find utterly meaningless, and she comes to you with it, please remember she's your little girl and she might just need to hear her daddy say that its all gonna be okay. \n\nMy dad acted like i was no longer allowed to inconvenience him with my tears once i hit 18. It hurts bc hes my only parent and i dont feel like i can call him when the world is overwhelming and i feel like a kid unprepared for the world.  \n\nEdited spelling, probly missed some, have an injured hand.",

(And their mother. )\n\nWhen they're born, whoever is at home looking after them i recommend sleeping when they sleep as much as you can. You can adjust to doing most chores with baby in tow and you can even leave them alone for short periods to explore if you setup things to be baby safe (they can learn to roll, crawl or climb given 5 minutes with your back turned so keep that in mind. ) and that way you can still manage the house and keep yourself rested enough to enjoy this time. Don't over stress yourself, enjoy your family.\n\nGet used to just doing things immediately, bottles, load of washing, dishes, floors and you'll find yourself with more time to relax with the babies plus a happier spouse. \n\nWith my baby everyone else told me he was difficult, even his mother struggled with him. I fed him when he was hungry, burped him a real lot, changed his nappy very frequently, let him sleep when he was tired and didn't worry if he didn't want a bottle occasionally. I basically fit my routine around his pattern and we had it down to routine each day by the time he was a few weeks old. He'd wake up smiling, go to sleep happy and was just good. \n\nWatch out for colic, gas makes them really uncomfortable and constipation can too but just be mindful, don't stress about those things. \n\nCo sleeping scares the shit out of me with new borns. My ex new a mother who's baby died co-sleeping.\nIf you're going to do it be careful. \n\nEvery time you strap the baby into a car put your shoe or something in the back with them, forgetting a baby can happen to anyone so it's easier to put a safeguard in place than be proud.\n\nHave fun, enjoy being a parent, you'll be great.",

I have memories of saying some cutting social remarks to his friends in a culture where women and children are seldom seen and not heard. Other adults would shush and remove a kid to play with the rest, my father never did. He just kinda smile at it all amused. \n\n- he didn\u2019t argue (too much, besides saying I\u2019m rude lol) when I called out his at times sexist comments. It was not many, but it slipped a few times. I had a voice. Going as far as returning my girly toys if I didn\u2019t want them, or keeping them when I did. I also recognized he\u2019s a product of his society\u2026eventually.\n\n- he taught me to be aware of my surroundings (in how I carry myself and dress etc.). \n\n- guided me in defining my values and understanding things for what they are.\n\n- he never made me feel weird for being angry or emotional. The stigma of hysterical women etc. I was not told to be sugar and spice - I\u2019d feel so ashamed for my outbursts/fights with siblings, and he just said \u2018anger passes, we are all good.\u2019\n\nOverall he had great neutral advice on fashion, relationships, etc. He gave me perspective to make decisions and set parameters on, never directions how to be or live. He saw I\u2019d never respond to that maybe, idk\u2026I wish he was here to ask. I\u2019d always said I\u2019d make him raise my kids (he refused lol), sadly he passed a year before I had my first. To this day, I see every lesson he taught me in every decision I\u2019m making. Idk if this helps at all, just comparatively I hear people talk about parents telling them what to do\u2026I didn\u2019t have that in my case. Not that way with so much friction. \n\nTry these resources to give you a perspective on parenting and gender norms/toxic traits. Don\u2019t limit your daughter to the sum of your fears and conditioning imho, let her be and thrive - guide her to understand the world and confidently navigate it. Her being a daughter is not the focal point per se, keep that in mind. Don\u2019t box/typecast her\u2026\n\nThe first link below is especially important- a must read for every parent. \n\nThe last one is what I hope to teach my child, and model it because kids see who we are not just what we say. Disclaimer (for myself to not feel icky): unfortunately the last one was written at a time where these were \u2018male\u2019 traits, but I assure you these are what anyone should aim for in terms of finding balance and strength in ourselves imho (resilience in life). Even though I do not like Rudyard Kipling as a man! Racist twit. But alas he could write\u2026\n\n- [On Children (poem)](https://poets.org/poem/children-1)\n- [Dear Dad (5m video)](https://youtu.be/gOk_qxkBphY)\n- [Tell him (yourself in this case)\u2026(9m video)](https://youtu.be/CRMCVWPt_38)\n- [If (poem)](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46473/if---)\n\nRemember they are watching\u2026you be the best you for them. Where in relationships you want it reciprocated, in kids you just love unconditionally and ime I\u2019m happy to change and better myself for my kid (no who did what and why should I, you just do what\u2019s best for them- including change yourself). I\u2019d start there until the baby arrives. \n\nI spent my time reflecting and looking at my life design. And preparing the first 4 years milestones cause I\u2019d heard it gets hectic, and I have to work full time so I wouldn\u2019t have time to do it after the baby comes. I highly recommend that kind of preparation. \n\nAlso BabyCentre apps and email subscription will save you! They ask your child\u2019s age and will keep you posted until they\u2019re like 5 or even older. Very handy way to keep tabs on their milestones and development. Have practical tools that are built into your life so you don\u2019t drop the ball ;)",

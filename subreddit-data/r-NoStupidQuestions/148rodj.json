How do I improve that aspect of my life, and why do I feel when I talk to a girl or a friend that someone is going to look and laugh at me. And right now I don't have anyone to call to go out with me for a coffee. I feel if social interaction's are exchange of value I don't have anything to offer, I know basic stuff to talk about, I'm funny but I need some time to get into mood.",

Most people don't think about us when we aren't right in front of them. \n\nLearn to be more confident and comfortable.  Join a public speaking club.  Take a standup comedy or improvisation class.   Volunteer more often at work, school, or at your volunteer jobs to give speeches or talk with others on things you have knowledge about.  \n\nMaking friends is more than just speaking.  You need to exchange small secrets.  You need to ask for favors (and deliver when they ask).  You need to demonstrate shared values and interests beyond just talking.    You need to show interest in their web of connections - family, work, neighbors, classmates, friends and expose them to yours.  \nYou don't need to do all of that, but you do need to do some things similar to those.   Over time and with increased investment and interaction, you can build stronger friendships.",

Well that\u2019s easy, the cactus ~~was~~ would probably be not really my thing bc it ~~looked~~ probably might be pretty painful but idk. But her other posts, if she has them of course, ~~were~~ might be surprisingly difficult to look away from in a good way, if you\u2019re into that I guess but I would find it kinda gross. ~~I couldn\u2019t~~ my friend said they couldn\u2019t tell if ~~I wanted~~ they wanted to **be** her, or **be with** her. Which is such a weird thing to say imo haha lol. So just hypothetically my thoughts, thanks for asking!\n\nEdit: how do her titties sit so pretty like that it\u2019s not fair \ud83d\udc94 unless she doesn\u2019t have any? or they don\u2019t even sit that nice idk.

That shirt that you were too lazy to put in your hamper? That towel that you were too lazy to take back into the bedroom? That singlet that you took off before you started pleasuring yourself, but which you're not going to put back on? They can all be used to help clean yourself off.\n\nAs a former disgusting teenager, I can confirm that I used to leave a lot of socks (both dirty and clean) kicking around my room. I can totally see why the whole 'jizz sock' thing became the go-to item of clothing... Socks are always there, and if you've got a penis, they're sorta the right shape/size for you to slip on to catch your jizz.",

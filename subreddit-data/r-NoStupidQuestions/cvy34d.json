    "postText": "I'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes I feel that if I go to sleep early then I'll just be like \"Well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home.\" Sometimes I just stay up so I actually feel more at home and not always have that feeling of just school, school, school. Does anyone else feel this way, maybe with work as well?  \n\nEdit: I know people don't like it when others edit their message saying \"thank you\" or anything, but DANG did I not expect this post to be the highest post in the sub after I, ironically, came home from school. Thank you all!  \n\nIt is interesting to see a lot more people than I thought stay up for free time as well. I can't imagine going to school or going to work, then going to sleep only a couple or few hours later, only to do the same thing again the next day.",

I used to get anxiety before I started sleeping more, I just thought it was normal. I started working out every morning before work and it just made my life way more enjoyable. The few hours of video games feel good at the time but I truly believe if you want to feel better, you can start with significant lifestyle changes.",

I went from 225 to my current 150 (5'7\" male) about 5 years ago now (hit the goal 5 years ago, started trying maybe 7ish). The journey started at the gym, but I discovered that I personally despise the gym. \n\nI don't lift weights, I don't run on treadmills, I don't do crunches or situps, I don't use any machines, I don't carry plates around the gym for grip strength, I don't own a medicine ball or a chin-up bar, I hate working out. I'm sure ADHD doesn't help, but the fact is, I personally just hate that place and everything that happens inside. \n\nThe key, for me, was finding activities that I actually do enjoy, and look forward to, that just happened to also be a great workout. For me that was BJJ and co-ed rec sports. \n\nI've maintained my weight for 5 years, my body has become nicely shaped and defined, I'm way stronger than I was when I was fat, and I feel like I've mostly done nothing to accomplish this.",

In terms of land mass we\u2019re 1/5th the size of SF but we have two patrol cars last I checked. Maybe 3.\n\n\u201cBut what about the jobs?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I work for a SF tech company and just work from home here in Kansas every day.",

Preferably things you would actually like to be able to do. Sort these activities from most to least anxiety-inducing. Assign them a rating from 1 (barely any anxiety) to 10 (maximum anxiety). Start with something around anxiety level 3-5. Your job is to do this thing every day this week until it's no longer challenging, then switch to something higher on the list.\n\nBefore doing each activity, write a few sentences about your fears, how you think it will feel, what you will think, physiological reactions. After the activity, write down how it actually went. Make sure not to leave the situation before your anxiety levels decrease, which they will if you start with something that feels somewhat maneagable. If you leave the situation before that you are reinforcing your anxiety by \"escaping\" a danger that is all in your head.\n\nThere are ancient structures in your brain that regulate emotions. You can't really reason with them, you have to demonstrate to them that the situations they fear aren't actually harmful. This involves practice, or as psychologists call it, exposure. Social anxiety is highly treatable with CBT.",

Amazon could afford to double the hourly wage and hire twice the people so you got more time off, without  reduction in pay. But it also can't because shareholders wouldn't like the drop in profit.\n\nedit: They can't actually double it and may have been a bad example since their margins are tight, but it's not about them. This issue isn't about one corporation. Someone suggested that Apple might be a better example.\n\nThe few  are getting very rich off the labour of the many, and the wealth isn't 'tricking down'. It's also not resulting in shorter work weeks.",

That's what happened when women joined the workforce. Suddenly everyone had more money because of duel incomes, so pretty soon the cost of electricity went up along with everything else. Now we need dual incomes just to survive. Needed services like utilities and health care will always leech as much from people as they can, increasing to the maximum profit levels possible. When our average income increases, they raise their prices. Because we need them, we don't have a choice but to accept.\n\nBasically modern capitalism is set up to enslave workers for the benefit of corporations and the government, no matter what.",

I basically stopped doing homework and just played when I got home from school. Rather than just making up that hour or so, I didn't feel like my need for play was satisfied unless I basically did no homework. I was lucky to have graduated high school.  \n  \nWhen I got my first job (in highschool), I discovered that I would not have summer breaks... no more being out camping for a week at a time. No more sleeping in late most days. I began laying around in bed whenever I had free time. During the school year, this meant I would go to bed when I got home.  \n  \nWhen I started working as an adult, I discovered that there would be many weekends when I would work, or my friends would work, so our days off would not match up. I feel lonely as an adult, and get drunk on my weekends. I have a wife, now, so it isn't so bad as binge drinking alone...  \n  \nBut now that I'm married, I get no alone time, and I often have housework to do on my time off from school (I'm a full-time student). I put off my housework and homework when I am alone so that I can have the break I need... but the breaks I take are too long or too often, and I'm struggling to get my work done.  \n  \nI stay up too late to make up for lost time, and take too long of naps to make up for lost sleep. I play too much minecraft because I have to satisfy my desire to play before my wife gets home...  \n  \nI do it, but I don't think it's healthy. I think it's a symptom of an unbalanced lifestyle.",

I'm in a boat towards the same path. \n\nMost of us have straight up 6/7am to 4/5pm work, in an ideal scenario we go to bed around 10pm. So 5 days of the week you essentially have 5ish hours for dinner, including making it, some household stuff, maybe a bit of mandatory things like groceries and with the remaining 2, maybe even 3, hours you're supposed to chill a bit, enjoy some freetime and maybe do some hobby stuff. That's not even close to enough and that's given kinda an ideal scenario, and it only gets worse from there with kids and stuff. Even if you cut sleep by 2hrs, giving you 4-5hours, it's still hardly enough.",

My parents (upper middle class) refuse to take jobs with less than 5 weeks of vacation a year (on top of xmas, easter etc).  They also demand to work from home when there is no meetings. Of course theres people who live to work also.\n\nIn my current internship my employer keeps insisting that, if I dont feel like it I dont have to show up as long as I get everything done. Evenings are getting darker so on sunny days I prefer to play golf and work when the weather is shit.\n\nIve noticed that pretty much all employers that employ highly educated staff need to take the approach that people work so they can live. Otherway around and people leave.  \n\nMaternity leave is 105 work days so a little over 4 months. For fathers its 54 work days. On top of that theres parental leave of 158 work days that the parents can distribute how they wish. \n\nEDIT: Sick leaves dont have anything to do with the vacation days. Sick leave can be paid for a year, after that theres disability benefits and rehabilitation assistance etc",

Staying up late just steals time from tomorrow, and I'd either oversleep or wake up feeling crappy and sluggish, and that often would lead to a cycle of crappy days, and trying to stay up late, playing games, drinking or doing drugs, trying to \"make up\" for the crappy day I had. The only way I broke that cycle was to go to bed early, wake up early, and make the most of the time before going in to work or school.\n\nI thought I was a night owl, but mostly it was that I was always waking up tired from staying up wasting time all night. When I finally turned my life around and started making good choices, I quickly realized one of the best things I could do, and the best way to do the things I *truly* wanted to do (less time spent on sites like Reddit and more time spent working on writing novels) was to make myself go to bed on time and wake up ready to do the work I wanted to do.",

What works best for me is listening to something while I fall asleep. It's something of a balancing act to find something that I can listen to that is interesting enough that it keeps my mind occupied, but not so much that I then stay up listening to it. Old sitcoms, audiobooks that aren't too intense, and podcasts are what work for me. Futurama, Bob's Burgers, certain books by John Scalzi, and The Adventure Zone podcast are my favorites. Even then I often have to mix them up so I don't get \"used\" to them. I'm constantly looking for new media that is just the right blend of entertaining and engaging, but not so much that it makes me think too hard.\n\nSome other things that help me:\n\nKeep a consistent sleep schedule, be in bed at a certain time, screen off except to play media. Make sure to set a timer on anything you are listening to.\n\nDrinking a cup of tea or glass of water before bed (doesn't help me sleep but helps me wake up without a headache)\n\nLet thoughts go similar to meditation, focus on your breathing (short inhale, long and slow exhale is supposed to help you sleep)\n\nNo lights on in the bedroom. No computer/router lights, and no visible alarm clocks. Especially not that last one.\n\nI wish I could give you more advice, but this is still a struggle for me. I'm pulling an all nighter tonight because tomorrow I'm starting on the graveyard shift for a few months. I'm going to try and keep up on all this and get a good \"night's\" sleep every day, but it's going to be a struggle.I hope some of this helps or you find something that works for you.",

If you decide to go to college and college is an option, you have so much more control over your schedule.\n\nRegardless of what is in your future, you can choose right now to make time for yourself. Journal. Plan daily walks, join clubs. You can take time in your day for yourself. Carve out time for your hobbies. But also, it\u2019s ok if sleeping or napping is a hobby. Your body and mind are growing SO DAMN FAST. It\u2019s ok to feel tired and need to go to sleep before 10 pm. There is no magic value in staying up late. \n\nI wish you the best",

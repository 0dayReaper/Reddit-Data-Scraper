    "postText": "I understand humans get \"bumped\" out of curiosity and some sharks (bull and tiger) are just persistent in attacking everything,  but why haven't sharks evolved to steering away from where humans have gathered for so many years (popular beaches) and be able to identify the form of a human is not prey (they have a great sense of smell). Sharks migrate several times a year to where they can find their natural prey along coast lines and continents and it seems hard wired yet they adapt to where prey goes. I guess I am curious as to why they have not gotten hard wired to stay clear where popular human gatherings occur in certain areas or developed a sense that humans are not yummy.",

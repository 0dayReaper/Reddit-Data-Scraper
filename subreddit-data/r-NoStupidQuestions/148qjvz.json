    "postText": "When I first heard people using the word \"woke\" in the context that you usually hear it lately, I thought it meant \"enlightened.\" I thought it was a way for people to say that they had challenged their beliefs and came to a new conclusion. I don't see anything wrong with that, so why is \"woke\" now used as an insult? You hear it in political ads, saying that they'll defeat the woke mob. That just sounds like old-fashioned intolerance to me.",

I think it\u2019s a consequence of social media more than anything else. And honestly that\u2019s probably just how languages develops in general but it\u2019s on larger and faster scale now for certain words/phrases.",

An introvert is the opposite.  \n\nBut people will call those who enjoy social interaction an extrovert even if they\u2019re not. \n\nI am an introvert. Social interaction is exhausting and I\u2019m at my best mentally when on my own. But I do enjoy companionship and being social, so I make an effort to do it as much as I can stand it.

It was originally used (at least in my awareness) as a teen to described someone who was aware of the issues black people go through in America. It was typically associated with the black community, and being \u201cwoke\u201d meant you were aware of more systematic issues of America than what is typically taught\n\nBLM and 2016 is really when leftists were beginning to get demonized with 50 million \u201cSJW Owned Compilation\u201d swarming the internet. As BLM began getting demonized by the right, \u201cwoke\u201d began to get applied to anything relating to progressivism. It was originally meant for a specific issue, but the scope widened when the right began non-stop attacking anything on the left. Soon, they began to refer to anything progressive as \u201cwoke\u201d because they began to associate it with the left in general\n\nAs time moved forward, \u201cwoke\u201d underwent a transformation from relating to black America, to almost any progressive cause/issue, and now it\u2019s just used as a buzzword for conservatives to fan the flames of a nebulous and non-existent boogeyman",

Your explanation is part of the problem with the woke religion. And you might even be completely unaware of how it has affected you. I don't blame you, but if you read John McWhorter's book on Woke Racism, you will see that a much more sinister thing has happened with the ideology of those people who claim to be woke. More than a cult, it has become a religion and with religion comes religious prosecution. \n\nJohn McWhorter is neither conservative nor white. He has studied language for most of his life and he is a celebrated Linquist and scholar. He writes a column in one of the big papers (New York Times, I believe) and his analysis of the current situation in this country is eye opening.\n\nWhile the members of this woke religion are trying to avoid any criticism by claiming that the right wing politicians are saying unfounded hateful things about them, the truth is much more important. Please read the book or listen to it on Audible. He does a much better job of explaining the woke religion in context and why we must as a society stand up to this damaging ideology. Sincerely and with all due respect, please check it out.",

That however draws the attention of the predator and if they\u2019re already poised to strike, possibly triggering their attack reflexes, increasing their chance of the monkey who gave the warning being killed, which means not passing on their genes (or at least not as much if they\u2019d already reproduced.

Weren't these the same people that refused to believe \"defund the police\" could mean anything other than \"abolish police entirely\"? These are the people who are now saying \"we must end the woke mind virus\" when what they really mean is, \"corporations are profiting from pretending to be woke, but their actions aren't woke *enough*\"?

So \"woke\" became that term.  You can't really defend \"non whites are terrible\" but you can just say \"oh, you're just too woke!!\" when you get criticized for it.\n\nIn short, it has been around, but became a term (along with \"cancel culture\") used a lot more often because hateful people were grasping at straws to defend their hate.",

We don't have a big collective struggle like a world war, we don't have to beat the Soviets, and most younger people have abandoned religion. So there's a general lack of purpose and a growing sense of isolation, combined with an ever-increasing saturation of social media.\n\nSo a lot of affluent (mostly white) people who are bored and have no sense of purpose decide to learn about the rest of the world around them and make the shocking discovery that systemic racism/sexism/bigotry XYZ is very much real and alive. Great. They make it a point to share this realization with everyone they know and talk about how they're actually an ally and it's other white people's fault and how they're so self aware and bam - black square on Instagram, BLM merch, let all the women you want to get laid with know how much of a feminist you are, the list goes on. What are these people doing to actually alleviate the struggles that marginalized groups face? For most of them, probably nothing. The only person getting any benefit is the person who's proclaiming these issues and \"spreading awareness,\" which is to say just spreading awareness to other people who won't do shit except \"spread awareness.\" They pat themselves on the back and feel good about themselves, because they have better morals than all those Trump voters.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations see that young people value things like equality and diversity, so they tell ad agencies to hire a checklist of every marginalized demographic or identity they can think of. They make their ads to show how inclusive they are, all in the hopes that they can sell more stuff (which was probably made in a third-world country sweatshop by some ninth-generation victim of colonialism).\n\nA lot of right-wingers (who want to grind their axe on an out-group and feel less insecure about their aging cultural identity) rightfully see this hypocrisy and call it out as being \"woke.\" People on the left take the bait and react, and thus we get the current iteration of the Culture Wars.",

You'd think the party of individual liberties and freedom would understand that. It's not murdering a baby either, it's preventing a baby from forming since it's just cells at that point. Or do you think plan B is an abortion pill too? Sure it'll become a baby if allowed to but it isn't until a certain point. Plus the bible wasn't even strictly against abortion either for people who like to use religious arguments against it.\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/what-the-bible-actually-says-about-abortion-may-surprise-you-186983\n\nAlso nobody on the left worships Joe Biden buddy only Maga seems to worship the cult of 45. No one gives a fuck about Biden. You guys are so hung up on trans people when they are like 0.1% of the population it's pretty pathetic how obsessed with them you guys are.

Some of these lessons included but were not limited to 1. Explore sea ice melt and then write a letter to your congressman (which we never actually mailed) urging them to put a stop to offshore drilling in Alaska (3rd grade) 2. Read a book about police brutality in the 1960's Jim Crow South and draw parallels to incidents today, use the book to illustrate that police have too much power. (1st grade) 3. Read a children's book about a girl whose neighborhood is being gentrified. Pointed out how our local city is also getting new homes and buildings and asked the students if those business owners should have a right to build there. This was 3rd grade! And students in my class were some of the students living in those new homes! I hope you're not arguing that it's okay to make 3rd graders feel guilty in class because their parents chose to move, but that's what the Lesson was about, and that's exactly what happened.\n\nNow as a former teacher, I would *never* advocate for banning books. That's just as communist. Books are sources of information and banning people's right to information is an atrocity. But in the same manner, highly politicized books should not be required reading for teachers. There is a middle ground. Sadly neither side wants to settle there right now, but it's the right answer.\n\nThe reality is that in some cases woke ideology goes beyond asking someone \"not to be a bigot\". I was required to teach political ideologies to my students and pretend to enjoy it or else I would've been fired. That's dangerous. Schools should be places where children are taught and encouraged to think for themselves, but that's sadly not happening, in the name of raising a \"tolerant\" generation, that's actually anything but.",

Initially meaning \"I've woken up to see the systemic racism and injustice\", or a refusal to accept the injustices of the status quo. BLM, #MeToo, Antifa were all movements that protested against systemic oppression that was largely seen as the norm, previously.\n\nTo conservatives, \"Woke\" has become a form of reverse oppression and overreaction of equality-centric movements and an attack on \"traditional\" or previous social norms. They see Affirmative Action movements as being anti-White, Diversity and Inclusion efforts as being Anti-male, and LGBTQ+ movements as being \"anti traditional values\", which is cis-het relationships. \n\nThe reason why there's so much pushback has to do with extreme media portrayals. There's hyperbole and fear tactic stories about children being forced to undergo gender reassignment surgery by mentally-unwell teachers, classrooms with kitty litter trays for children who  \"identify as cat\", or stories about how white men are finding it hard to get jobs. \n\nIn reality, most of these are political tactics to distract from actual causes of problems, which are usually economic (housing affordability, inflation, etc).",

(I suggest you read Vonnegut's short story about Harrison Bergeron: the most brutal dictatorship that will ever exist is the one in which the people who can't live in the world due to personal shortcomings and unresolved traumas force all the rest of us into the same self-perpetuating cycle of eternal victimhood. I can't snowboard. I don't demand someone amputate Shaun White's legs.)\n\nExample. On many subreddits. IF I were to say \"So and so is simply being a c---.\" I would get blocked or booted or banned or whatever the Thought Police call it. Because the word is (gather breath, clutch at pearls, come through the fire, reassure yourself that you're strong and smart and humble) \"offensive.\"\n\nIt isn't to me. It's a very precise word used to describe a very particular kind of person who deliberately makes overarching goals difficult by introducing invented controversies so that the person in question can control the discussion by means other than intelligence or persuasiveness of their argument. They assert \"offense\" and that's the end of it. But your \"offense\" doesn't trump my right to speak, nor can your \"offense\" be proven. I can, just as easily, take \"offense,\" and we will be stuck in a closed loop of pointlessness.\n\nTwo people or two groups who genuinely want to exchange ideas are not afraid of words. And they don't allow a coterie of bullies to shut down every conversation that the coterie \"disapproves\" of. I, for instance, strongly dislike the term \"queer\" as a catchall for gay people because, when I was a teenager, it had only one meaning. But I don't go around bullying people into scared silence for using it. I don't demand the libraries remove all copies of William S. Burroughs' novel by that name. Because I'm not the only one who has rights. And I'm not interested in living the sort of life where I'm so frickin' fragile that I can't cope with words or everyone tip-toeing around on pins and needles around me for fear that I will get them fired or banned for using a word that I decide isn't acceptable.\n\nBack in the day, the people who objected to television programs never had a good answer to this: \"If you don't like the program, switch the TV off. Or leave the room. Or read a book.\" The current woke crowd, similarly, isn't interested in working out issues, they've already figured out the answers and you can either agree with them, vociferously, until your vocal cords give out, or you can agree with them, vociferously, until you fracture some vertebrae nodding your head so rigorously.\n\nI'm a lot more interested in what people have to say and in finding the weaknesses in my own thoughts and arguments than in working out my multiple psychological traumas with a group of hostages who are bound and gagged at my feet due to how I've managed to commandeer the entire discussion and lock it down forever.\n\nThat's why woke became a bad thing.",

Black people can't reach into their pocket without police assuming it's a gun and using that as a justification to take their life.\n\nAs for a left wing party also being to blame for the suffrage of blacks? What left wing party? The Democrats? Hardly a left wing party. When compared to the fascists in the Republican party, sure. Compared to anywhere else in the world, not even close. You should look up the phrase \"Overton window.\" Democrats today are barely to the left of Reagan. \nAnd hey, just to make you happy I'll say Biden did push for the 90s crime bill and that absolutely hurt black communities. Not nearly as much as the war on drugs itself though. Which was really just a (admitted to on tape) pretense to imprison blacks and hippies. After all, the 13th amendment abolished slavery, unless you're convicted of a crime ;) there's a reason we got the highest prison population in the world. 20% of the worlds. That's a lot of cheap labor.\n\nAnd as for \"protecting our kids the right way\" what way is that exactly? Legalizing child labor or just refusing to make child marriage illegal and continuing to defund education? That's what Republicans have voted for, so tell me, what is it? Maybe it's more tax cuts for the richest people, as is standard GOP tradition.",

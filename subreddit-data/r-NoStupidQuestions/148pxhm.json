    "postText": "When i was in high school there was this girl Abby and she was so beautiful and popular,  but I was shy and awkward.   I graduated back in 2013 and I recently found her on Facebook, I added her about 2 weeks ago but she still has not  accepted me or declined me.  She's super gorgeous,  and I know I sound like a creep but I'm not.    I just always liked her,  there was something about her beautiful hair and smile.   I'll be honest we talked 1 time in high school,  but like i said I was super awkward \n\nShould I message her or would that be too weird????",

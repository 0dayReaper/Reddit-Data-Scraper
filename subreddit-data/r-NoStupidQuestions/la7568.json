Start by looking through the menus and settings until I find something that sounds like what they want to accomplish.\n2. Failing that, Google it.\n\nSeriously, they're constantly asking for help with some obscure program I've never heard of, and are positively amazed that I was able to figure it out. *I just read the fucking menus. Why can't you do that, mom? You're an English teacher! I know you can read!*",

Porting would require a full rewrite, and the current code has been battle tested for decades. The new code would likely introduce new bugs.\n\nThe money it'd take to port is much much larger than paying a premium for the programmers of old to maintain what already exists. Businesses and governments have a much easier time swallowing a sizeable annual payment instead of a huge one time investment followed by an ostensibly smaller annual payment.\n\n&gt;And aren't there any tutorials on it? Or not as good as the retired?\n\nThere are, but it's like the difference between someone working with who's a published novelist compared to someone who has watched a few Ted talks on writing.\n\nOnce you know a few programming languages, you can pick up a new one in a matter of hours. But to truly master a language takes years, if not decades.",

Then in college, we got 5mb internet at our house and holy mother of God was it incredible. If my computer was suddenly getting very slow, I hopped online and did some Yahoo searching. Pirated a lot of programs and games because I was a stupid college kid with very little money and now had viruses out the wazoo stealing my email passwords with key crawlers? Asked Mister Jeeves about it. New smart phone doing something stupid years later? Googled that shit. \n\nEverything I know about technology is self-taught. All the time I get co-workers or family members asking me to help them with shit that takes me 20 seconds to google and find an answer to. These people could do the same thing and learn something but it's \"quicker\" to just go bug the \"guy who knows technology\" and waste my time looking up piss-ant computer issues that are usually solved by \"did you restart your computer?\"",

            "comment": "I have a kind of sad story for this one.\n\nMy dad was way ahead of the curve, taking CS classes when he was in high school (college classes in high school). He was advanced in both hardware and software. It was turning into a whole new world. He kind of dreamed at working for NASA, but settled running the entire server system and being the sole IT person for a plastic mold company that relies heavily on computers for the artists to make molds. He worked there I wanna say 20 years. He was let go during the 09 recession to have his work shifted to independent IT consulting, tbh I dont entirely blame them because he had alcoholism issues and diabetes, he was already walking on canes and had a few hospitalizations. The worse was yet to come, he threw himself into alcohol and lost his legs, developed alzheimers mixed w alcohol related brain function issues. This happened when I was 9.\n\nThis backstory is relevant, because even tho he was a tech genius and constantly building PCs for his friends, working on laptops, kept teaching himself, he didnt teach me anything but had hopes of building a color organ with me. That kit is still in the basement, 10 years later.\n\nI am now the designated computer geek for my family. I built my PC, I do soft coding for minecraft and friend level minecraft servers, I can do basic troubleshooting and diagnostics. I taught myself damn near everything. I researched, I befriended dev's who taught me, I spent countless days working to better my tech savviness, which tbh isnt a whole lot but meets my gaming requirements.\n\nMy dad loves to say how HE taught me all that I know. He keeps going on and on about how well I know java and how he helped me with it, how I assembled my PC solely with him holding my hand thru the process, etc. It drives me nuts. Hes called me frantic before because some of the junk on his desk flipped his PSU switch and he couldnt figure out why his computer wasnt booting. I helped fix my mum's tower, his liquid cooling tower, his 2 side project towers for his friends, and he either takes the credit or takes credit for me learning from him.",

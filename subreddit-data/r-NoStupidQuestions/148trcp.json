    "postText": "All of my usb ports stopped working on my pc. Pc is still fully operational and turns on. Last time I brought it to the shop for this it was fixed in 5 minutes and I was told it was just static buildup in between my graphics cards. Monitor still has power so I know it\u2019s an issue within the pc considering anything plugged into won\u2019t turn on. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a method to discharge the static so I can avoid being charged to have it looked at?",

It was about 8 months ago last time it happened.\nCould it have something to do with my outlet even if if i\u2019m not having power issues? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s just a connection issue with the pc. My mousepad, headphone charger, and keyboard are all connected to the pc and are receiving no connection from it.",

At the repair shop, the guy seemed to wave a type of cloth around my graphics card that fixed the issue when this happened previously. Maybe I\u2019m not using proper verbiage but it\u2019s not actual static shock coming out of anything if that makes sense. I can\u2019t seem to find a way to phrase it properly for google so that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping someone here will pick up what i\u2019m trying to put down.",

(Happy fathers day grandpa! you mean the world to me, even if it doesnt seem like it. I appriciate everything you have done for me and my dad. 2 people wouldnt be here without you! I always miss you a lot, and i am grateful and proud for everything you have accomplished. (insert funny or loving memory, fine if one isn't available.) Fathers day is 1 of the days that we all come together to celebrate you! Love you always, never forget! -(your name) )",

Write to him about how you're going, wish him well, tell him you care about him. Hell even telling him that you didn't know what to write so you asked Reddit would make my family members chuckle at least, and greatly appreciate the gesture.",

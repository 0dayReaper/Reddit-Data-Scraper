They don't assume you were self-fellating.",

There\u2019s a lot of talk out there on bad chiropractors and the profession as a whole. I got adjustments for a month and it helped but I don\u2019t think is a long term fix. Going to a PT will help retrain and strengthen what you need to get back to normalcy.",

You most likely strained some muscles  along your spine rather than caused any major issues and just need to rest for a day or 2, but yea, please see a physiotherapist.\n\nEdit to add: a lot of comments are giving specific advice on back care, please visit a properly trained professional for advice, not someone who is commenting based on what you've said, in the case of a back problem,  as above, try get an appointment  with a physiotherapist rather than a chiropractor. And describing overstretching in a yoga pose or stretch to get under your bed to reach your phone is a good suggestion. I wouldn't need to know the absolute  specific truth, just the movement you were doing, in conjunction with assessing the way your back currently is moving in order to treat you.",

Iyengar came up with the idea of combining these exercise techniques with some of the teachings described in old Hindu texts like the Yoga Sutras and let the result loose on America in the 1960s. Since then, yoga fans have grown by the millions, with few realizing that they are practicing a chanted-up version of early ***20th-century gym class.***",

It hates, absolutely hates, giving the answer \"There's nothing on the Internet about this\", which leads it to prefer mountains of garbage over a useful \"No, don't waste your time, you probably are the only person with that error message\". \n\nMy favorite is when it says \"Did you mean &lt;something completely different&gt;?\" and then includes the results for &lt;something completely different&gt; and doesn't offer you a way to search for what you actually searched for except by \"Putting\" \"Fucking\" \"Quotes\" \"Around\" \"Everything\".

They don't really get exposed to a desktop or laptop. I have new employees who *do not* know how to use a computer even though when I was their age I at least knew what Microsoft Excel was. They spend a *significant* portion of their time on their phone though and I have no doubt that they know more about that platform's capabilities than I do.",

Another big reason I google stuff with reddit is because there's a pretty decent percent of the community with a rigid almost moral code about citing their sources. Last reason is the familiarity/ease of use and the karma system. It's not perfect, but it's easy to read quickly and glean information from.",

I still think you can find genuine humans offering real opinions, especially in the small niche subs.\n\nThe objective of the bots is on a higher level, in a manner of speaking... Nowadays the \"hivemind\" aspect of reddit is far far worse than it was 8-10+ years ago, and I think that is what the bots are intended to achieve.\n\nIf you believe Reddit to be truly representative of your human peers, your perspective of the world will be heavily influenced by browsing /r/all because of the apparent consensus around many nuanced societal/humanitarian issues. That consensus doesn't actually exist in the real world, but seeing a semblance of a consensus on websites like this has a powerful effect on the human psyche.\n\nHumans are social creatures, and that hasn't changed despite us transitioning much of our socialization to the internet. What has changed (for the worse) is our susceptibility to inorganic social influence. \n\nHuman have an inherent need to fit in, but \"in\" is evermore defined by the powers that be, as opposed to being defined by each one of us acting as members of real, tangible human communities.",

I dont know what changed. Has the crowd gotten younger?  Some comment sections are filled with people being confidently wrong about a thing. Think r/whatsthisthing but its a tea kettle and everyone keeps saying its an antique iron. And corrections get downvoted. The post with the basketball spinning guy, for example. People saying its staged because the thrown item has a pointy part. I think its just young kids who havent had those cordless phones with an antenna piece. \n\nOr its just the extra socially part of social media. Like the facebookification. The addicts are the ones who rise to the surface. But the addicts also have nothing of substance to add, its just noise. \n\nI dunno. Just venting i spose.

The trouble is there's so much junk out there now, it would be hard to make.   \n\nI grew up using dogpile and askjeeves and stuff, and learned fantastic google-fu. I used to google everything when smartphones came out, like thirty to fifty searches a day. People would ask me something and I could find any answer. Now I sometimes struggle to find basic answers to fairly basic questions and it takes much longer.  \n\nI'll admit I used to write SEO articles and Amazon affiliate linked articles for 1cent/word. I was part of the problem but I needed the money. I wrote entire series of articles on topics I knew nothing about. For example, I've never even held a gun but I wrote 30 articles in one week on various gun related things, and some of them ended up on first page on Google. I apologize.  \n\n Wikipedia isn't even in the top page for a lot of results anymore, it's ridiculous. I have to manually type it. If I search \"running shoes\" then I want the Wikipedia article on running shoes as one of the top results. If I want to buy running shoes I should have to type \"buy running shoes\". It seems like boolean searches are all fucked too. Its all fucked.  \n\nClicker options would be amazing. Filter sales/not-sales sites.  \n\nI just want information about running shoes before I get \"top running shoes 2022\" and \"buy running shoes at target\". Even if I type \"what makes a good running shoe?\" Or \"types of running shoes\" I still get fucking SEO bullshit blogs (written by people who don't know anything) sales sites.  \n\nI don't own any running shoes and I'm blaming google for my poor health.",

In most SEO projects I worked with, the first thing they change are metatags to get more relevance in the searches, and only then at some point - if ever - they actually change the content of the page.\n\nYounger people have an understandably (negative) bias towards ads, but truth is organic can be as bizarre. A top page isn't necessarily the most relevant, even though Google does try to do that with their updates (like putting a heavier score on users' experience on the pages, instead of just click rates), instead.. what happens most of the times is the top pages are the most *optimized* ones.",

I'd like to believe we're offering answers to searchers' questions as part of my job for the better part of a decade has been search analysis and making sure we're answering the questions people in our industry are asking. I know all too well how frustrating it is to hit the first result thinking you're about to get your search question answered and finding only a wasteland of tangential, poorly-written content that should be buried 10 pages deep. I've worked for pubs just juicing results and spitting out content to flood results, and also did a short stint writing clickbait (more like Top 10 bullshit, not actual clickbait) which was surprisingly ethical as the editorial standards were high and articles were well-researched with sources.\n\nIt's a fuckin jungle out there and has changed so much since I got my start in the mid-2000s. When I started doing SEO back then yeah there was an element of gaming the system but the results were far more relevant than now and optimization was more about ensuring good content got seen, not forcing bad content to the top (although that certainly happened back then, too). Idk if it's that Google has slipped or moreso that too many crap outlets have figured out how to manipulate it. Google is always changing the algorithm around to mitigate the latter but it doesn't seem to be doing much good. Supposedly Google has been trying to prioritize higher quality content in the last few years, it has always claimed to but you don't have to be an expert in it to know that to be untrue.",

These days, do a search and you get bombarded with 20 image results, a map showing 5 nearby shops which might be somewhat relevant, a few sponsored ads, and then finally a sorry list of barely relevant search results. \n\nGoogle has also become absolute shit at finding anything remotely old/niche thing - Google look way, way to much at what is popular with the general public right now. For example when you remember an old news article from 8 years ago and try to find it again, Google just won't serve it to you even when you're very specific - instead you get pages upon pages with current news articles that barely have anything at all to do with your very specific search, just because everyone is clicking those current day headlines and no one are viewing the article you're trying to find.",

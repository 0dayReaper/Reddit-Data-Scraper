I was quite uncomfortable by his presence and I wanted to send him his way the moment I saw him but I felt bad and I have a habit of forcing my way through hook-up out of pity for wasting their time instead of being straight with them. \n\nBut it\u2019s not fair on me or on them. So how do I tell them, I\u2019m not interested in the hook-up?",

That\u2019s why I ALWAYS meet the guy before in a public spot for coffee, etc.  (I don\u2019t do that now \u2018cause I\u2019m married). \nSometimes, I\u2019d meet a couple days before. It really helps make sure you\u2019ll both have a good time.  Also, I have met the guy in a coffee shop and then went back to my place for the hookup. Don\u2019t give in out of pity or obligation. There are A LOT of scummy creeps that will catfish you with old pictures and count on you to not send them away.",

Which is the kind of worth the commenter meant.\n\nThe moral rightness and inherent obligation, or calling, felt by life saving professionals like EMTs is part of why they can be paid so poorly.  They do it because they feel a need to do it or are benefiting society or whatever.  They rarely quit when wages are cut or the hours extended.  They rarely go on strike when the hospitals raise rates but lower pay so the executives get larger bonuses.\n\nThe amount someone is paid is a fine balance of maximizing their profitability to their employer while minimizing the chance of the person quitting (either to change companies or leave the career).  This can be done many different ways, but paying people more is rarely the first choice because that hurts profitability and companies exist to increase profits over time.  You can't hate a company for doing that any more than you can hate a fox for eating someone's chickens.\n\nYou can and should, of course, hate a company's leadership for picking the least moral options when maximizing profits, for conspiring with competition to keep pay artificially low, for cutting corners and bleeding customers just to make the leadership even more money.  That's an appropriate position.",

            "comment": "I was listening to a story this morning about how the majority of firefighters are actually volunteers. And I already knew that many paid firefighters are considered part time or seasonal employees, which comes with lack of benefits (a big wildfire killed the whole fire department of a rural area near me some years ago, and no one\u2019s widows or children got anything because they were not considered full time employees). That combined with the fact that modern work schedules don\u2019t allow a ton of volunteer-on-call work means that not only are firefighters paid poorly, they\u2019re aging. It also means it\u2019s dangerous to have a fire or car crash during \u201cstandard work hours.\u201d Yikes!\n\nEdit: I read this wrong and forgot to answer the actual question of why. Because necessary jobs aren\u2019t often profitable. It\u2019s objectively a better world where you don\u2019t die in a fire, but it\u2019s not a more profitable one. So no one\u2019s bankrolling it. Conservative politics also tends to hyperfocus on cutting budgets and saving money, even if it comes at the expense of our quality of life. So for crucial jobs that are part of infrastructure, they\u2019re often at the mercy of political PR. People aren\u2019t interested in the fire department until their house burns down, or the hospital until they get sick, or the schools until their kid is an illiterate, unemployable load. It\u2019s popular to cut funding to those kinds of things because people are always thinking \u201cwhat has the fire department ever done for me?\u201d rather than \u201cwhat might I need the fire department to do in the future?\u201d",

It is a fact that the guns and robots and medical devices I have made fetched even higher prices. I just work in a shallower organization and the owner is into paying for quality.  Normally a manufacturing concern has a front office that millions pour into and puny little paychecks pour back out.\n\nI've come to realize that pay is actually based on how much you are respected on hiring. It is a fact that switching jobs is the only way to advance in my trade for most people. There is a brutal logic to this, but it has the side effect of exploiting any workers who fail to leave after a few years.",

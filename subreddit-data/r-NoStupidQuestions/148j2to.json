Either the person signed with a notary verifying they are who they say they are, or there's security camera footage of the person's face while they're signing whatever the document is. \n\nThere are also forensic handwriting experts who can tell the difference between how two people write, even if very similar. They are typically called on where a signature or other handwriting is an important element of a court case.",

They do have a fairly good rate at catching fakes.\n\n99% of things with signatures don't require verification and will never be authenticated.  However, there are a lot of items of memorabilia that do need to be authenticated because of the dollar value involved.",

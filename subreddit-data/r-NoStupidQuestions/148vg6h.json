I\u2019ve looked through several comments sections and generally I\u2019ve seen it whereby if a post has a vast amount of negative comments, the comment is collapsed whereby you have to click/tap on it to view it. However, sometimes this is also the case I have observed for comments with numerous positive upvotes. Why is this the case?",

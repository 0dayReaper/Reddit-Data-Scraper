    "postText": "I know this probably isn\u2019t the right place to ask this, but I didn\u2019t want to be judged for my question and lack of knowledge of how the body works.\n\nIn November I underwent liposuction on my abdomen and back. It went pretty well, but I\u2019m still not happy about how I look, so I\u2019m getting an Rx soon for weight loss. \n\nDoes anyone know if the medication will target areas that were treated more effectively than other areas of my body?\n\nI know there\u2019s different kinds of pills, I\u2019m hoping to get on one that boosts my metabolism and breaks down fat instead of making me feel fuller. This question is a hypothetical for if I am able to get on one that does the former. Please be kind, thanks!",

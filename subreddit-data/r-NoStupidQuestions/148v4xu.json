    "postText": "I've been wanting to get back into dating recently. It's been a few years since I've tried, I've just been taking time to work on myself. Mentally, I've come a long way since my mid-twenties (almost 30 now). Still working on the financial side though. \n\nAs for my body, I kinda prefer being chubby, couldn't tell you why. I eat mostly healthy, workout most weeks, and have an active job. But it feels like everyone I know has recently started getting jacked. And I feel more self conscious now than I have in like 8 years. Especially since many of my friends mostly talk about that. I'm glad they're getting healthy, and making progress. But I cant shake this completely irrational pressure I'm putting on myself.  \n\nOn the other hand, I have a near non existent libido. I get my rocks off normally, but when it comes to sex, It's just..ehh.  And this has been a cause for numerous potential relationships to not work out. I dont know if its got something to do with being bi-curious or not.\n\nOverall, any advice on how I can get over this irrational, self inflicted self consciousness I'm feeling about my body? \n\nAnd when it comes to asexual dating, I don't even know where to start as just saying \"I'm asexual\" closes doors, but also isn't entirely true.",

Whether I'm asexual or not, I'm not a romantic. I'd still like a relationship. \n\nAnd besides that, I want to stop being self conscious and would like to date again.",

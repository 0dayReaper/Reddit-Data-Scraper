    "postText": "So about a year ago, I, 23 [M], met someone on Tinder. Long story short, she gave me one of the two (pretty sure it was gonorrhea, had the textbook symptoms (burning during urination, discharge etc.), but tests always kept coming back negative). It took about 6 months to finally be given the treatment for both. After treatment, the symptoms went away and I felt good. I'm just wondering, I live with my mother and we share a toilet and sometimes she would organize the towel I had used after a shower (we don't share towels though). She's not at risk right? I have terrible anxiety so it's probably just that acting up but I just want to be sure that she doesn't have it.",

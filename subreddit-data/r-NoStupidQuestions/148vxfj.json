I\u2019m not one to provide either (if you want a definition, google the definition of an economy and read the applicable entry; if you want a proper response then hopefully some nice Redditor will provide in time! Best of luck \u2013 I\u2019ll be keeping tabs for the summary as this is such a far-reaching / \u2018arch-\u2018 question!)",

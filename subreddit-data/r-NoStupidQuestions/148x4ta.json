We get a gym, two pools, two splash pads, five parks, flowers, USA flags put up every Veterans/Memorial/Flag/Independence days, and they make sure my neighbors keep their lawns maintained, can\u2019t paint their house certain colors, fences can only be so tall, etc.",

Not because they don't happen, but because its not really newsworthy and it doesn't generate clicks or outrage headlines.",

Which is why I would never purchase a house with an HOA. \n\nThere are basic municipal codes that cover most things that matter like, how high a fence can be, noise levels, what you can do to the house\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s more than enough regulation for me. I don\u2019t need to be paying someone to tell me what I can and cannot do to my own property. \n\n\nPlus you won\u2019t really know if your HOA is a nightmare until you have to deal with them. I\u2019d much rather steer clear all together.",

The municipality doesn't want to pay for stuff, so as a condition for building permits, the builder must establish an HOA. That scenario is increasingly more common. Of course, the homeowners can just disband the HOA after the fact, but there's usually enough busy bodies to prevent that from ever happening.",

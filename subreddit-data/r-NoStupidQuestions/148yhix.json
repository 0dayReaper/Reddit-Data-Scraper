    "postText": "Hello! A relative of mine, Jason, made an offensive comment to my younger sibling a few months ago. Long story short, they said \u201cyour loose\u201d (sexual connotation) as a comeback. \n\n\nWe didn\u2019t say anything when it was initially said because it was at a family gathering, but we brought up a week later. Jason called my sibling and said \u201csorry for what you thought you heard,\u201d he would NEVER say that, that\u2019s not the kind of man he is, etc. and overall was leaning towards manipulative instead of an apology. He also called me and gave me unsolicited directions on what to do the next time something like this happens and denied ever saying anything. Jason has also made out of line comments to me in recent months around how I should carry myself. \n\n\nWe haven\u2019t talked to the relative lately, when we\u2019ve seen each other in person unintentionally we have avoided them and it\u2019s put a lot of strain on my family. \n\n\nAnother family member recently came up and said that they did in fact hear the comments. Now, Jason is apparently \u201cthinking of how to apologize.\u201d Other family members have reached out and tried to pressure my sibling into forgetting it and moving on. \n\n\nI think my sibling deserves a sincere apology for the comment and way things were handled and I\u2019ve been pretty adamant about that from the start. Are we wrong (me and my sibling) for standing our ground and not just moving on?",

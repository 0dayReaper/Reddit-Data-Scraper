    "postText": "I'm not sure if there were multiple single called organisms that formed around the same time, or if it's believed that all life came from one. If all life is related to each other, it's quite astounding if you think about it. In an abstract way you could say we are all part the same organism. The trees, the grass, the flowers, the fungi, your cat, your dog, your family, your love, friends, and even little tardigrades all come from the same microscopic biological computer that happened to copy itself. \n\n In a way, our lifespan is just a construct. If you think about it, we've been here for 3.7 billion years give or take. We started as a microscopic thing who's parts came together perfectly, and now we cover the surface of this planet. We've survived asteroid impacts, ice ages, volcanic eruptions and so many more world ending events. \n\n Apologies if this seems a little out there for this sub, or if I'm coming off as weird. But, I've been thinking about this a lot recently, and it's such a beautiful realization that offers this feeling of connection, and for me it is in opposition to the nihilistic part of my brain. \n\n I can't tell if I'm being cringey or if this is something that would be good to consider from time to time lol. Would like to hear what yall think.",

I'm no biologist or paleontologist so apologies if I'm getting terms wrong or something. I'm sure it's possible but perhaps a wildly slim chance that it could happen. But honestly the odds of life developing at all is slim as well. \n\nFrom what I remember, DNA tests/comparisons between every form of life on this planet is somewhat related(between humans, apes, plants, fungi, insects, fish, etc) , just depends on how much. Maybe forming the building blocks of life on earth is such a similar process that they might come together to create similar strands of DNA? I know now we're talking prehistoric microbiology that is all speculation on how the first life forms came to be and understanding how these proteins and fatty acids came together to create life isn't 100% understood.",

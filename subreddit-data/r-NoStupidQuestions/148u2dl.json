You cannot complete all of the content without purchasing additional figures. Additionally, people saw it as a \"dumbing down\" of the Spyro franchise, because it was aimed at a younger demographic, and simply rode the coattails of an already existing popular IP.\n\nBut if you like it, then play it and enjoy it. Nobody can tell you to stop enjoying a video game.",

They're not interested in the game, they're interested in bullying people, and they can fuck right off.",

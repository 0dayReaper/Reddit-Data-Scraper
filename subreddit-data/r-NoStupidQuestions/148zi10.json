Some people are reasonably fit, healthy, horny badgers until they die at 90. Some people aren\u2019t that bothered about sex, and are having it once a year max at 40. Some people want more sex but health problems make it more difficult- but here\u2019s the thing- there is a wealth of sex \u2018activities\u2019 aside from just intercourse, and if people want to, even with health issues, there will usually be something they can manage to do with a partner!",

    "postText": "I know this question seems sus but I literally am just curious where the line is. Because techinally the original smiley face is copyrighted. And also every artist takes inspiration from others. There are also always trends. A couple years ago a specific type of smiley face without the mouth was trendy for hats and hoodies for sorority girls. I was scrolling through Reddit and saw someone talk about how someone else stole their drawing they were selling. I couldn\u2019t find out what they looked like. But from her description the other person just changed the colors and a few things. \n\n\nObviously there has to be a point when it isn\u2019t copyrighted anymore once you change the original image to a certain point. Like let\u2019s say I drew a seesaw with a triangle in the middle like kids do. If someone copies my triangle but nothing else then it\u2019s hard for me to think it\u2019s copyrighted bc you can\u2019t expect no one else to use a triangle.",

    "postText": "Im a 19 year old and i graduated from high school last year, but I'm unsure if I should apply to a regular college, community college, tech school or a tech boot camp to have the best chance if getting into a good paying job related to computer science fields. I'd like to get a bachelor's degree in computer science (or equivalent) but I dont want to stay too far from home. \n\nI live in southwestern Ohio and I don't come from a particularly wealthy family. I'm working a factory job rn and recently started saving for education. I did okay my last year of high school but not excellent, but I do have 5+ years experience in coding Lua on the Roblox game platform, so I'd love to get a job in game development or something.\n\nWhat would be my best options? Thank you",

So you can do 120 credit hours (a 4 year degree) in 1 semester if you go ham. DoD pointed me at them.\n\nFull disclosure: business school is EZ mode compared to IT. If you just need a degree for HR gods just do a business degree. [Webber did his in 2 months for the lulz.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5R70_WgZTk)\n\nMy IT degree + MBA sticker costs were 3250/semester and 4250/semester in 2020ish. My final out of pocket was about 3.5k (AOTC rebate, scholarship, etc). Took 9 months.\n\nGood luck stranger.",

Crustaceans (including shrimp and lobsters) are arthropods, putting them in the same general family as insects and arachnids (spiders, scorpions, etc.), and those two groups usually *are* called bugs.\n\nBecause \"bug\" isn't really a well-defined or scientific term, it's hard to say what puts something in or out of the club.  While science might suggest that shrimp *could* be called bugs, it doesn't change that most people simply don't think of them that way.",

Cicadas are Hemiptera, but spiders aren't. Often though, 'bug' means a creepy-crawly in everyday conversation. It refers to land arthropods with at least six legs, such as insects, spiders, and centipedes.\"\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://www.curiousmeerkat.co.uk/debunking/biological-linguistics-bug/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj569OihsH_AhWYGTQIHSGEDfMQFnoECB8QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2xcNRDjUVnhpSLZUt2lCMF\n\nEdit: Science requires them to be a land arthropod",

If a bunny thought the hunter or a wolf approaching them was just a large bunny, they probably wouldn\u2019t run away or hide. Cats are on the opposite end of that equation because they are usually the predator.",

But they accept you as part of their small social world, mostly because they're bred to. Rabbits especially will assign you a place in their social hierarchy, which is determined by grooming order; dominant rabbits demand to be groomed (petted) first, while submissive rabbits will groom you before asking for reciprocation.",

Pigs don't really get into trouble that's more than a couple inches off the floor unless you get a rare spunky climber pig lol.  They're typically just very zoomy ground potatoes.  Afaik, most rabbits like to jump on things.  Uhg pigs will also really like to get under your furniture and stay under there and poop lol, which gets gross.  Afaik, bunnies can be litter trained.  \n\nAll this being said, I love my little potatoes.  They're sweet, lovely company.  Nothing is more soothing than listening to my herd munch on hay and quietly chatter to themselves",

I now have two larger high energy (apparently, they are the biggest snoozeballs) dogs and it is much, much, MUCH easier to care for them. If you want to keep bunnies appropriately, it's a lot of work. Pet stores sell them as low maintenance, easy, kid friendly pets but they definitely are not. Sure, you can keep one in a tiny cage, feed it pellets and take it out to cuddle it all the time, but then don't be surprised if Lil' Hopsalot bites you, rattles the cage all the time, gets fat and needs the teeth clipped every two weeks. At least a life like that will be short, as the bunny will probably die years ahead of its time, most likely from some gastro/intestinal problem (or from uterine cancer, if it is female). Sorry, this took a bit of a dark turn!",

Cats know their owners aren't starving, they see them eat multiple times a day, and they know that their owners provide them with the vast majority of what the cat eats. It's much more likely that the mice are just gifts of appreciation, like giving someone flowers.",

This is what it smells and tastes like. You should eat it so you do not starve.\" Then they eventually bring their kittens mostly/half-dead prey to teach them rudimentary hunting/killing skills. Once the kittens have adequately adapted to this and can kill weakened/crippled prey, the parent cat starts bringing them live prey. \n\nSo we know based on studied behavior patterns that cats don't just bring you crippled-but-still-alive prey just for fun or as a sentimental gesture. They do it to try to teach you fundamental hunting skills, because that is how their own evolutionary instincts work. It's hardwired into their brains. Cats aren't scavengers, they're predators. If they are intelligent enough to note that their humans are eating things, they are also intelligent enough to note that their humans are not hunting and killing prey, which is seen as a major problem for cats because they need to hunt to survive. A feral cat that dumpster dives for food and can't hunt will not survive for long, and that's how some cats see humans. So they try to teach you those essential survival skills the same way that *they* were taught, and in the only way that they know how. \n\nFun fact: some domestic cats will do this with large bugs if no other prey is available and they decide that their humans are incapable of hunting them on their own. Our family's late, fully indoor cat used to bring my older sister dead cave crickets he killed. At first we believed he was simply seeking admiration and praise. But then he started bringing her cave crickets with several legs torn off so they could no longer hop around, and would refuse to kill them himself. Eventually he started bringing her just fully alive cave crickets with only 1 leg missing. He was not trying to share them with her, he was trying to teach her how to hunt and kill them herself. \n\nThat being said, we also know that cats who live in colonies often hunt together and share prey. So while still not quite a merely sentimental gesture, a cat bringing you a dead animal may also be their way of trying to bond with you as a valued member of their social group by sharing a meal.",

I thought they were kinds like big hamsters or something.   \nBut then I got one that is a house bunny (she has the run of the house and uses a litterbox like a cat), and not only does she have thoughts and a complex personality, she has some serious OPINIONS and isn't afraid of expressing them. I'd say she had just as much personality (which I think takes thought) as my two dogs, she's just more subtle. \n\nThey also have enough of a thought process to hold grudges, for YEARS. I was the one that had to give her her medicine after she got spayed like 5 years ago, and she still hates me for it.  \nEveryone else in the house can pet her. She'll even come up to them and put her head down in the way that says \"hey, you, pet me here, now. \" They're very hierarchal, and the lower bunnies have to groom the dominant bunny when the dominant one request it. Petting from a human is perceived as grooming. \n\nBut me, when I crouch down to try to pet her, she makes a grunting noise that seriously sounds like a pig, and runs off with a thump of her back foot (yes, like Thumper) just to drive the point home.   \n\nNo amount of treats have made up for the grievous sin of giving her icky medicine when she already wasn't feeling well.   \nGuess who feeds her everyday? Me. Who cleans her litterbox? Who built her her very own little 2 story midcentury modern house? Yep, that's me too. She will come when I call her name, but only to see if it's food-related. Even when it is, she takes the treat from me and still grunts at me as she turns away.\n\nShe knows how to express to me that her food bowl is empty and needs me to refill it, as well as when she's doing things she shouldn't be doing and she gets caught. .\nShe cuddles with and requests grooming from my 70lb boxer dog, but hates the 4 lb morkie (almost as much or maybe even a little more than she hates me).   \nShe will lay down right next to a doorway that she knows the morkie will need to go through, and then bully her when she finally does.    \n\nRecently, when she's been molting (shedding) and losing a lot of hair, she has actually started to let me use a brush on her. Maybe soon I'll even be allowed to use my hand.",

I remember there were 2 meds- a painkiller that was approx similar to aspirin and the medication they give to prevent GI stasis since she was under full anesthesia. I'm pretty sure they both tasted sweet because they smelled sweet and had that kind of sweet stickiness. She fought it every time though. Which was stressful, since I was afraid she'd hurt her incision fighting against it.  \n\nBut of course, to be fair, it could be completely unrelated to the spay or the medicine and that's just what I always chalk it up to since it was around that time that her personality was developing and we were getting to understand it. As a matter of fact, we knew it was time to get her spayed because she had started getting a little sassy.  \nAs my dad, who raised Flemish Giants, would say, \"Female rabbits, you need to either get them laid or spayed\" or else they can get mean. So she might have started hating me even before that, or it might be that I'm the one who clips her nails too.  \n\nAnd who knows, maybe it's something more along the lines of that she considers me the \"dominant\" one, since I'm the caretaker, so she doesn't let me \"groom\" her but demands grooming from everyone else. \n\nIt's okay, I love her anyway, just from afar. And I know she loves me in her own way.... probably mostly the \"Hey, what makes you think it's okay to sleep while my bowl is empty?\" sort of way, but that's okay too.",

Hence the belief that they see us as big, dumb, inept cats. \n\nFrom a cat's POV, we are fairly similar to kittens. We often do not consistently recognize or acknowledge feline body language, we don't respond with recognizable body cues (in no small part due to the lack of movable ears and tail, which are vital to feline-to-feline communication), we can't hunt, and we communicate exclusively vocally. \n\nMost fully domestic cats learn to adapt to humans and adjust their own behavior/communicative patterns accordingly. Feral cats, young cats, and long-time strays need to be socialized extensively by humans because they need to learn how to do just that.",

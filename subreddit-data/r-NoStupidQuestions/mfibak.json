The stop sign was  at the exit of the parking lot where I worked. I pulled up to the sign and dropped something in the floor so I sat there a minute to fish it up, so I was there a good minute stopped at that sign yet I \"ran\" it. Luckily the security cameras covered that area so I just disputed it in court and arrived with the video.",

Where we lived at the time pedestrians had right of way at crosswalks with tons of signage saying so and stop signs in the middle of the middle of the middle of the intersections and both ends saying so.\n\nA cop pulled over my sister for \"not stopping\" for pedestrians at the end of the crosswalk that weren't even close or even ready to cross yet. She did stop and they waved her to pass because they weren't ready to cross yet but the cop decided to ticket her for it anyway",

New Year's Eve, on my way home through a ton of traffic, I stopped for a yellow light, then proceeded to use my signal to change lanes, and again to take the exit for the interstate. Then I set my cruise control for about 3 mph over the speed limit. Cop pulled me over, wanted to know when I had my last drink, said I was being too careful. He made me exit the car with my 3 small children in it to do a field sobriety test on me. I hadn't had a drink since a friend's wedding...in October! My kids were in the car, on NYE. OF COURSE I WAS BEING CAREFUL!",

Driving with two friends, one who is black in the passenger seat.\n\nDickhead pulled us over, had ME get out of the car and read my license plate and collect the IDs of my friends. Whole time he was parked to the side of my car with his spot light on me. Was only like 18 at the time and no clue how to react to these requests I've never had in a traffic stop. Turns out 1 of my tag lights were out and he decided to check all of us for warrants. \n\nLittle did that cop know, the black friend's dad was a lieutenant or captain just a few county's south. Dad must have ripped into this guy good for that shit because friend got a called from that cop apologizing a couple hours later.",

I worked at one just before finishing college and we had 2-3 machines. They emptied the cash every week and the money was split 50-50 between the company that owned the machines and the station. They had me watch our half of the money for the week once and it was literally a table covered in cash bundles.",

For example, needing an appointment to get a driver's license.

Every person that can't afford time off to vote, is one less vote.  Note that people who rely on public transportation are significantly impacted. \n\n3) cancel Sunday voting, as more blacks vote on Sunday. \n\n4) the above steps make lines to vote longer, so make it a crime to hand out water.",

Not only does this dramatically increase the number of people trying to use a single polling site, but the volunteers have to determine which district you live in to get you the correct ballot, which slows down how quickly people can get into the polling station.\n\nWhy do they do this?

So if you can show that Christianity is getting an unfair privilege not afforded to another legally-defined religion, just because the Christians dont like the *name* of the other religion, then either the courts need to let the Satanic Temple do the same thing the Christians are allowed to do, or *neither* the Christians or the Satanic Temple can do the thing.\n\nAnd you're right - it doesnt always work.

The court ruled that the school had to either have 0 religious statues or allow statues from all religions, no middle ground.  So the school now has a statue of Bahamut teaching children.\n\nIt created a ritual for having an abortion.  A major part of the ritual is to \"be at peace\" with \"no unwelcome distractions\".  Meaning if the state forces a doctor to talk about the 'the baby', make the woman listen to the heartbeat, or force the woman to look at a sonogram then they are violating her religious freedoms.  I do not know if has caused any lawsuits but I do know a lot of Temple members are lawyers so it was probably crafted/worded in a way that cant be ignored without being open to a lawsuit.",

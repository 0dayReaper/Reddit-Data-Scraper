    "postText": "I'm considering living on campus this upcoming fall. Surprisingly, the main thing swaying my decision to live off campus is the tiny shower (not that it's relevant, but each dorm has it's own bathroom. Shared between four people). \n\nI had the opportunity to stay the night for orientation and did NOT enjoy the shower. There's barely any room to move, and I felt as if I couldn't properly wash myself since I couldn't get my body or wash cloth out from under the spray. The showerhead isn't even adjustable. I'm not a claustrophobic person at all, but I almost felt claustrophobic in the shower due to this. \n\nHow do people deal with this? Do they step outside of the shower to scrub and step back in to rinse off? Cut the shower on and off as needed? Other ways?",

If im trying to shave my legs, I usually step out so im half in half out, but regardless I hate it. I\u2019ve mainly started showering at the gym now.",

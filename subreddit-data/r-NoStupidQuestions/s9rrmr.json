            "comment": "I love animals, all of them. But I always said I wasn\u2019t really a cat guy. Then I had some health issues leading into the pandemic. My mom got me a cat to keep me company because I was stuck at home all the time. When we went to the shelter, he was just sitting still in his cage with his eyes closed, seemingly content. I saw him and asked the attendant if we could see him. She opened the cage and he came up to me and sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on my hand. I moved closer to the cage and he leaned up against my chest and purred while I pet him. So of course he was the one. \n\nTwo years later, he follows me around my apartment always sitting next to me. At night when I climb into bed he will be hanging out in the living room while I browse my phone. As soon as I put my phone down and turn off the light, I flip to my right side. Every night since I\u2019ve had him, he runs and jumps into my bed and lays down next to my chest, head resting on my arm. He will lay there until I fall asleep. Every morning, when I wake up he will hear me toss in my bed and run and jump in my bed to greet me. In an otherwise dynamic world that is always changing, he\u2019s been the one constant keeping me grounded.\n\nSo yeah, I do that too.\n\nEdit: [Cat Tax](https://imgur.com/a/pRX6asy)\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think about cropping out my foot until it was too late \ud83d\ude2c\n\nThank you for all the kind words and awards. I will make sure that Patches gets some extra special treats and pets today \ud83d\ude3a",

My little man is 11 now, closer to 12 now really, I can\u2019t believe it. Had him since he was about 1.\n\nI always wanted a cat and my mom said she\u2019d get me one but never did. One day my best friend (we were like 15?) said she was basically fostering a kitten. I didn\u2019t know a thing about him or what he even looked like but I always wanted a pet so bad, so I said I was on my way. \n\nI brought him home. I knew once my mom saw him she wouldn\u2019t be able to say no.\n\nAnd he\u2019s been my bestest friend since. He\u2019s a void. He doesn\u2019t care for most people but adores me. And the feeling is very mutual. I never knew a love like this, really. 10+ years in sometimes my heart feels like it will burst with how much I love him. He\u2019s everything to me and I\u2019m so lucky to have him.\n\nInteresting reading about your cats sleeping habits as my void is different (which is normal obv, just interesting to see how they differ in their particular habits). He always hops into my bed when it\u2019s getting late and we sleep together, every single night. But what I find cutest is that he stays in bed with me till the moment I get up, every single morning. On days where I sleep later than usual he watches me every time I stir waiting to see if I\u2019m finally getting up. When I finally do he does too. That moment in itself makes every day good. What did I do to deserve this amazing friend?!!! I try to repay him every way I can.\n\nI know no one asked but I love him and I wanted to share. We\u2019re all so blessed with our fluffy babes\n\nEdit: [cat tax](https://imgur.com/a/RVcYgKU) which I am more than happy to provide. Had to stop myself from posting even more photos. I\u2019m his paparazzi so I have plenty of content. Thanks for the award and for reading this, my heart was warmed to see that my comment about him&lt;3 got some visibility. We\u2019re in bed together now hanging out :)",

We were driving in the dark and hit what we thought was a possum. Got home and heard MEOWWWWWW coming from my front bumper. Turned out there was a whole entire cat wedged in between the plastic grill and the radiator. She used up one of her 9 lives that day for sure because she was scared but not hurt.\n\nShe was REALLY skinny and seemed grateful that we found her. We took her to the vet right away. She had a broken fang and fleas, but no microchip, and nobody had posted her in the local missing pet groups.\n\nWe paid for her shots and flea treatment, and brought her home. She gained about two pounds in ten days, and we got her chipped as soon as she had enough meat on her bones. She is super cuddly and affectionate, and I am her favorite person and it makes me so happy to have her.\n\nThe last pic is her presiding over our household and establishing her reign as Queen of the House.",

And I walked by because I always say hi to the cats when I'm there, but I didn't expect any cats that day. \n\nEvery. Cage. Was. Full. Some even had two cats!! \n\nSo this was back when they still had cat toys in my PetSmart, so I grab a cat toy and i start playing with the cats because they're adorable and fluffy and I love them. One cat in the very first cage was rubbing against it and all that so I started to pet her. I must've sat there for almost five minutes staring at this little, grey tabby kitten while petting her. Eventually, I accept the fact i have to move on with my day and try to pull my hand out the cage. \n\nThis cat reaches out with her paws. Grabs my hand. And pulls my hand BACK into the cage. And puts her head on it.\n\nNeedless to say, I got a cat that day.",

This is a big deal for me because back then I was terrified of highway driving and would go out of my way to avoid it. We have been attached at the hip since I got her. I work nights, and when I leave for work she goes off to the spare bedroom to sleep. My wife and daughter won't see her until I pull in the driveway. She knows the sound of my car and will pop out of the spare bedroom and wait for me at the door. \n\nI was in the hospital for 2 weeks a little while back. They told me she was waiting for me at the door every day when I usually get home and would stare out the window for hours when I didn't show up. After a few days she got depressed and wouldn't leave the spare bedroom. Was barely eating. As soon as I walked in the door after my stay at the hospital she bolted out of the bedroom at a million miles an hour with what I can only describe as an excited meowing noise I've never heard her make before and she would not stop until I picked her up. That evening she didn't leave my side for even a moment. \n\nI simply don't understand how people say animals aren't capable of feeling emotion or love. The way she acted when I got home from the hospital had proved to me that was all a bunch of bullshit, they love us as much as we love them, if not more.\n\nI've been a little upset lately because Facebook reminded me that I got her 10 years ago. She's in good health but the reminder made me realize that she may not be around much longer and I already know I'm going to be an emotional wreck when she passes.",

She just had kittens a few months ago, and didn't really show them affection.\" I promptly replied, \"well, I have mild allergies to cats, so that sounds f*ing perfect.

We got them as 6 week old kittens from a friend who adopted two neutered female cats that were most definitely not neutered. One tiny ginger boy sat in front of my husband and refused to move. While he was holding that kitten, I knelt down and clicked my fingers to see if any others would come near us. A small black ball of angry fluff scampered over and attacked my fingers. We took both home and they're now 9 years old (both neutered). Our luck really improved when we got them and we just watch them sleep a few times a day. They're spoiled and we wouldn't have them any other way. We also had to buy a bigger bed for all 4 of us to sleep on comfortably.",

He's so incredibly intelligent and affectionate, likes to just sit near people. He has his routines; he takes care of the two dogs we have. \n\nLike wtf, he's pulling his weight in the house? I swear he's a human trapped inside a cat. \n\nI say \"besos\" and then he'll do a little bite on my nose. Highlight of my day.\n\nEdit: and when we're sleeping and he's sleeping on our shelves I'm happy thinking about him and his comfort. He's a good dude.",

She knows better than to jump on me (certain situations I'll allow it), at least I finally learned to catch her though.... she only weighs about 25lbs less than me. She's always that happy to see me after I leave her somewhere or come home. \n\nDefinitely not showing emotion. Like when I'm sick and she brings me her teddy bear she's had since she was 8 weeks.

If I laid in bed with my wife, she would come and lay in between us demanding pets. She had the boniest elbows and it genuinely hurt when she would get super needy and basically wiggle up between us. When we quit petting her, she would shove her head under one of our hands and move it back and forth to pet herself. She was the most loving dog I\u2019ve ever heard of when it was regarding our family.\n\nWe had to put her down awhile back, and I\u2019m tearing up just typing this while laying in bed and wishing her bony elbows were keeping me awake while she grunted trying to get pets.\n\nThis is going to sound pretty stupid but please give your girl an extra hug/kiss today. I would give so much to have my girl at 15 months again. Gsd\u2019s really are amazing dogs, and if there\u2019s any animal that can prove animals have feelings it\u2019s them. My wife had to take her to get shots one time when she was an adult, and she straight up ignored my wife afterward for a day. She was actually holding a grudge.",

Not until after my sister and I got there just after they had finished putting the fire out. Fortunately, my cat was fine (the firefighters that escorted me into the building to look for my cat put her on oxygen right after we found her, and my sister and I took her immediately to a vet's office for a checkup after that) but I still look over at her when she's sleeping to watch her breathe because I'm so, so lucky she's alive.",

A bunch of her teeth were rotting and had to be removed.  I was her second foster home and took her in just after her leg had healed, and just before her mouth had finished healing.  And I couldn't give her up. \n\nI look at her while she sleeps and I'm so grateful to have her, and it gives me such peace knowing that she's not living on the street and she's all fixed up.  I get so sad thinking about all the pain and discomfort she's had in her life, and it brings me such joy to see her at peace.\n\nSleeping pic after I got her\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4jiKijp \n\nMore recent pics\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9DfyGmZ \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/x6ELw6t",

    "postText": "This embarrassing, but I have pretty much exactly how I want to look in my mind. However, the way I actually look is basically an uglier version. The main issues are that my face isn\u2019t long/narrow enough, and my chin juts out way to much and it makes my side profile vomit-inducing. How do I look the way I want? I included reference pictures on my account of me, and of how I want to look. My only setback is I\u2019m 20 and basically broke so I don\u2019t have surgery as an option. I accidentally logged out of my throwaway and can\u2019t find the OG post",

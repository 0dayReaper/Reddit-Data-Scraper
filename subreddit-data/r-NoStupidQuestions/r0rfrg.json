It made it sound like the average guy is much stronger than the strongest woman. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/r09hsd/the_girl_is_cringe_the_guy_is_chad/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) had comments saying that her deadlift isn\u2019t super heavy. I do lift weights and can deadlift over her weight, but I thought it was just because she doesn\u2019t work out much. \n\nPersonally I have never been a situation where I have had to fight a women or pin one down, so I don\u2019t know. I just thought women were slightly less strong if not equal, but I\u2019ve been seeing things that say otherwise.\n\nEdit: To everyone calling me a dumbass, the subreddit is called no stupid questions.\n\nEdit 2: I have gotten so many replies my inbox has literally broke. Please stop.",

Sometimes I feel kinda bad about pinning her so quickly but that's because I forget how much of a gap there really is between our strength. \n\nA larger frame and a lifetime of testosterone makes a massive difference in overall strength even if you don't work out.\n\nI'm seeing a lot of comments in this thread of woman saying they took self defense classes and its great that they're taking that initiative. However it's valuable to keep in mind that confidence and a couple basic martial arts moves won't help you when there's such a gap in raw strength. Regardless of gender, best thing to do in violent situations is to run. Can't get grabbed, punched, kicked or stabbed if you've already run 50 feet away.",

But actually, the first thing they said was gtfo, get to somewhere with light and people, and they made us practice yelling in someone's face as loud as we could. Only _after_ that, they taught some stuff like sticking your fingers in their eyes, hitting some nerves in the forearm or grabbing their balls. But they very strongly emphasized the first points. And they didn't even bother with any fighting stuff beyond dirty moves (I guess the longer class probably covered some of that, but I was already thoroughly demoralized by that point lol)",

To expand further on your point about assault victims, apart from fighting hard enough, it might also prevent showing any reaction at all. Especially if they don't know the person well enough, imagine that they might want to say no. Now remember that they're also considering what the other person (that could pin them down and inflict life threatening injuries effortlessly) will do if they didn't like the rejection.\n\nA lot of things that are virtually non-issues to guys are complicated by this power imbalance and it's a valid concern that some guys just chalk this up to paranoia from women because they don't understand how more powerful they are in general. Which then bleeds to this societal idea that victims should have done this or that when the vast majority hasn't ever been in a dangerous situation where their will and power can be taken away on a stranger's whim.\n\nOf course a vast majority of people aren't shitheads but imagine that if the odds for men being potentially involved in an injurious altercation is 0.001% and for women 0.002%, sure that are very slim chances but then that's still 2x more for women and rightfully warrants a bit more attention.",

I did my best, but if his dad hadn\u2019t heard the scuffle and intervened (quite violently I might add) I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be. I took a lot of shame in that for a long time.

            "comment": "Quite a while ago I trained in a mma gym Im Venezuela since my back is really not great and because of my age I tried to stay away from the Young fighters. But I ended up becoming the older brother To everyone there. There was a young girl who I absolutely believe could make it big in mma. She had a temper and tended to be a little bit rough on training. From what I know she had some issues growing up and they would come out from time to time.\n\nShe got into an altercation with someone else and I made the mistake of trying to separate her from the person. She hit me 2 times and tried to take me to the ground. I lifted her up and took her to the other side of the gym. She calmed down and stopped talking to me for years.\n\nShe told me years later that she was afraid of me because I barely even moved when she hit me. It saddened me a little. \n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m pretty sure she would have broken something if I let her take me to the ground.",

Size/weight difference + upper body strength makes a huge difference.\n\nInterestingly in powerlifting the strength standards for M &amp; F are the same for squat and deadlift, but for bench press it is much lower for female lifters. The broadness and upper body frame on men just makes their upper body much stronger. Then consider that all these strength standards are based on % of bodyweight, which is usually much higher for men.\n\nWhen you put all that into a contact sport it makes a huge difference.",

I have some skeletal things that make it harder, so my PR isn't great, but I could do about 150 for one.  Husband's PR is 515.  \n\n\nIf you want something where neither of us is at a disadvantage, we can talk bench press.  My one-rep max is about 150.  His PR is 265 for 5 or so.\n\nEDIT: Some of you are quite kind. Some of you are not reading.  See that part up there where I mention skeletal difficulties? I know my deadlift isn't great.  It's likely that none of my lower body numbers ever will be.  But I'm proud of them. I work my ass off for them. Have some chill.",

The point was to give yourself an opportunity to get away, not to over power anyone. End of the class we all had to \u201ctest\u201d out against a fake male attacker. Our \u201cattacker\u201d was 50+ overweight, out of shape, campus security guy, who basically just swatted at us with boxing pads. Even so, within 2 sec of test starting, even using my \u201ctechniques,\u201d I realized even this schlub of a guy was so much stronger and easily, EASILY could over power me if he were really trying. Sobering experience but I am glad I learned just how much stronger men generally are than women during that test.",

One day she asked me to hold her down so she could see if she could push me off.  She couldn't.  She said afterwards that it was actually quite disconcerting how easily I held her down while she was trying to get me off with all of her strength.  And when reversed, I was easily able to get her off of me.  Like I was basically benching her while she put as much weight onto my wrists as she could.  And remember, we weighed the same.",

She jokingly said she could \"take me\" if she wanted to.\n\nI told her that her best defense against a man was to run as fast as she could to the closest lighted and populated area and make a scene to call police. Above all,  never let a man take her unwillingly to another location. \n\nShe laughed. \n\nI cleared a spot in my living room. Laid down some ground rules, and told her not to hold back. \n\nI'm no badass. No martial arts. No training. Nothing of the sort at the time. I pinned her down in a few seconds in all 3 of her tries. \n\nIt was a sobering experience for her. The last thing I wanted was someone I cared for deeply getting hurt thinking she could fight a grown man when her best option was to use her best option and just run.",

But I gotta say they were surprisingly very effective: they said EXACTLY what you say here. Never go willingly to a secondary location. Be very cooperative EXCEPT when it comes to that or explicit violence. Give the car keys and your purse. But do NOT go quietly with them. They say you can either be raped/killed where you stand in front of God and everyone or you can be rape/killed somewhere else with no one there to even try to help. If they were going to kill you where you stand, they damn sure will at the second location.\n\nAnd the other part that made me uncomfortable but was SO real. They teach them to only fight to maim and kill. Break fingers gouge eyes. If you get a hold of a weapon, kill them. Period. And take the weapon with you in case they try to pursue. They teach them combat almost exclusively from points of sexual assault. Where the primary goal is to get their parts into yours. As they say, since you know what their goal is, you can prepare for specifically that sort of grappling. And they teach them specific, fast movements to TRY from those sexual assault positions. And they then tell them that it almost definitely won\u2019t work but it\u2019s their BEST shot. The ladies that go to this particular class are if anything more proactive and aware than before and I was super impressed. None of them are allowed to believe they would win in a physical contest versus an attacking man. They are just taught techniques to give them a prayer and I respect that.",

Learning self defense and MMA in my opinion have become too intermingled. Fighting for sport and self defense are completely different. If I\u2019m on the street and have to have a physical altercation where fleeing isn\u2019t a choice you best believe I\u2019m going for eyes, throat, and groin. Or hair pulls, kidney punches, etc.  I want you down on the ground and incapacitated as soon as humanly possible. There are no rules in fist fights just hopefully people who walk away from their attackers. The best self defense in a robbery is to give them everything in your pockets, in physically contact run, scream for help, or just hit any soft spots as fast and as hard as you can. It\u2019s your body your life no one is going to call you a bad person for turning someone\u2019s nuts into mush if they\u2019re a predator.",

The remaining 10 women outliers, as advanced in athletics as they may be, could only grip as hard as the bottom 25 guys.",

I really thought that surely I'd be able to contend with him. \n\nThere was some struggle but honestly he overpowered me so easily, it was genuinely upsetting. It was like all my hard work lifting weights and running was a waste, I would never be stronger than any random guy who isn't even trying, and I can never train myself be to stronger.

[This](https://www.castironstrength.com/elite-strength-sports-ipf-and-iwf-a-comparision-of-sex-and-performance/) is a good article on the topic of pure weightlifting sports. To put it in perspective [this article](https://law.duke.edu/sports/sex-sport/comparative-athletic-performance/)  by Duke Law says \"Just in the single year 2017, Olympic, World, and U.S. Champion Tori Bowie's 100 meters lifetime best of 10.78 was beaten 15,000 times by men and boys.  (Yes, that\u2019s the right number of zeros.) The same is true of Olympic, World, and U.S.  Champion Allyson Felix\u2019s 400 meters lifetime best of 49.26.  Just in the single year 2017, men and boys around the world outperformed her more than 15,000 times.\"\n\nYup, you read that right \"boys\" males under the age of 18. The best mature women in the world with a decade more training can't even touch an elite male high schooler's numbers. A woman has never broken the top 500 in the world in any of the athletic sports listed regardless of sex and they rarely break the top 1000.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award strangers! This  is my first silver!\n\nEdit 2: oh my god thank you for the gold! This is my first gold too!",

                    "comment": "I replied a similar thing to someone else, but you can also compare Olympic weightlifting, which is just pure power expression. Li Wenwen, the superweight female gold medalist in 2020, lifted 320 kilos at a bodyweight of 150kg. The only male category she could have won would have been the men's 61kg, dudes that are literally 40% her size. She would have won by 7kg, which is less than the difference between actual #1 and #2 in that category. Going up to Men's 67kg, she'd have been 5th, #11 in 73kg (surprisingly she'd be 10th in 81kg, but she'd be much further from the 9th spot than from 10th in 73kg).\n\nIn the male superweight class, she'd be 58kg behind the #12 lifter and 168kg behind the winner, who is himself a 175kg bodyweight dude. With a 16% difference in bodyweight, he lifted 50% more pounds. Of course, this guy is an absolute monster, he beat #2 by 47kg, but it really shows that it's not close, because Li Wenwen is herself a phenom, beating #2 by 37kg. If weightlifting was coed, you wouldn't be able to tell, because there'd be no women on the Olympic stage, unless the weight categories were severely fudged.",

I said ok, would you like to arm wrestle or something to see? She then was really shocked at how easily I prevented her from even moving my arm, let alone having any hope of winning, and then asked her when she had had enough proof, showed her that when I wanted to, her arm was going down.\n\nShe didn't understand that while exercise and athletics can have a massive impact on physical abilities, there is also simply a massive innate biological difference between the sexes when it comes to natural physical strength.  If you see a male that isn't an athlete, don't automatically assume he's weak.  You'd be surprised.",

That's why weight classifications are so important in martial arts, you're very unlikely to be stronger than someone who weights way more than you.\n\nI'm a skinny and somewhat weak men thanks to a sickness I was born with but even I am stronger than most adult women to the point where only girls my size but that are also heavier can overpower me with some effort.",

I'm pretty fast and despite not doing any dedicated training and running in spikes for the first time ever I managed to win the silver in the 100m sprint. I was very proud.\n\nThe time I got would have placed me 7th in the women's Olympic final the same year.\n\nThe guy who beat me, who was only 15 at the time, would have won it.\n\nIt's an order of magnitude difference.",

I mean working in the food industry I would always do the heavy lifting and didn't think anything of it. It wasn't until I lived with my SO that I realized my strength. I'd close the water bottle lid normally for me and they could never open it. Hey unikorn can you move this object for me it's really heavy. Go to move it mentally prepared for a challenge and it super easy. Just watching them struggle lifting heavy suitcases and asking for my help. My SO wasn't out of shape or anything. They worked out regularly.",

She worked out a lot, and at that point I had gotten really lazy and stopped working out- so I was intrigued.\n\nSo I was like, okay, let's test this. I pushed her at about half strength. \nNearly put her through the goddamn wall.\n\nI felt terrible, but after the initial shock we both did laugh a lot. She realised they weren't really trying (and I felt even worse for being the one to actually push her lol)",

I told him to try and bend my wrist back (bad move in hindsight) and he immediately bent that shit like it was nothing and ended up accidentally twisting my fingers up in the process. Lesson learned lol",

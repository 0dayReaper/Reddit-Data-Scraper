In my experience, the best thing is to say \"I'm sorry, do you think you could rephrase that?\" To me, saying the same thing again will make it sound like the distorted version I heard initially. Changing the words allows me to try again with \"fresh ears\" so to speak, and I just make sure to pay very careful attention this time around.",

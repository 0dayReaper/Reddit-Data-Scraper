    "postText": "I am a math teacher for 8th graders at the school I teach at.  \n\nThroughout this whole past school year there was this running joke where the students would call me the goat.  \n\nAnd I would respond back each time that they are the goats and they would all laugh.  \n\nIt was pretty funny to be honest, and I never gave it much thought. But I realized that I have been partaking in a joke that I never actually got.\n\nI had a good connection with them, and they are all really good kids, so I don't really think that they were making fun of me.\n\nCan someone (maybe an 8th grader) explain this joke to me?\n\nAnd how would you respond if someone calls you a goat?\n\nEDIT: omg I am IN TEARS!!! I can't believe they were complimenting me this whole time!!!! Thank you all for answering this question!!!!\n\nEDIT 2: THANK YOU ALL for you responses and the awards this post got!!  If those awards cost money, please can you donate that money instead to a charity that helps kids?  There are so many good ones, this one in particular is one I personally recommend: [Kids In Need Foundation](https://www.kinf.org/)\n\nEDIT 3: the photo that appears on this post is **NOT my photo**.  I think that the photo appears there due to the link I put in the 2nd edit.",

He starts drawing three moles in a burrow on the chalkboard and speaking about moles. When he finished the drawing he said, \u201cThe only problem with moles is if you\u2019re the last mole in line all you get to smell is molasses.\u201d\n\nOver 30yrs ago and I\u2019ll never forget it.

It was popularized by his 8th studio album, titled G.O.A.T., and he credits Muhammad Ali for the origin, according to an interview in 2016 with Rolling Stone. It\u2019s contemporary use is mostly in instances of a person being a holistically positive and empowering individual, and has become more and more popular in recent years.",

            "comment": "**Hoax alert! Please, hear me out before downvoting me, and if you still do, please at least offer a rebuttal**\n\nI don't doubt that you're a teacher, or your students said this to you, there's no reason to.\n\nBut there is almost no chance that this post is not \"karma whoring\".\n\nFirstly, your account is **five days old...** **Jackpot!**\n\nOf course it could be a throw away account, but if it were, you'd probably mention it. But also, you've made several posts completely unrelated to this topic before this one, so you didn't create it just to ask this question. It would be less suspicious if this were your first post, instead of the 7th or 8th.\n\nYour post is **precisely** the perfect blend of sweet naivet\u00e9 mixed with being oblivious that you're a wonderful person that presses all of reddit's feely buttons. Just look at those awards! It's almost like it was intended to do exactly that...\n\nAlso, excellent reddit etiquette with the edits, **it's almost like you've been here much longer.**\n\nYou say they call you **\"a goat\"** in the title and then switch to **\"the goat\"** in the text, which are obviously not the same thing. Indefinite vs definite articles are not something people generally confuse. Being called a goat could have  multiple meanings, being called \"the goat\" has one, and is easily found with a quick search.\n\nThey've said it all year and you're just wondering now what it means? Also, all year, none of the 20-30 13 year olds slipped up and said what it meant? Was this orchestrated? Why didn't they tell you, anyway? Surely they'd want you to know.\n\n**Why didn't you ask anyone around you in the real world before asking reddit? Why didn't you google it?** Googling (or duckduckgo, etc) \"the goat meaning\" brings up \"greatest of all time\" as a search suggestion before you even hit enter. Urban dictionary exists, and this definition is in there.\n\n**Another of your (very few) posts even details advanced knowledge of search engine usage.**\n\n&gt;\"I couldn't find any matches when reverse searching for mine either.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are advanced reverse image searching services out there (that you pay for) but I don't know if I want to use them.\"\n\nI highly doubt that your first instinct to find out what being called \"the goat\" means was to post on reddit. a site you've only been using for five days, when you knew a search engine would have answered your question (before you even hit enter), just without all of the attention, praise, awards and dopamine.\n\n**What if it meant something negative/mean/offensive (etc)? You really not going to check that before telling others that  a large number of people you work with has been calling you it for a year..? It might have meant deathly halitosis, or bad combover. Risky!**\n\nCome on Reddit. We've been here before!\n\nAgain, I am not saying OP is definitely not a teacher, or that their students definitely didn't call them \"the goat\", or that they didn't know what it meant at  the time and so had to look it up. These are all perfectly plausible.\n\n**What I am saying they almost certainly knew what it meant when they posted it to reddit, for the karma, awards and attention.**\n\nBefore anyone calls me envious, I'm writing this because I don't like stolen valour (or usurped awards) or \"karma whoring\", and I don't like emotional manipulation for personal gains.\n\nYou may now downvote me to oblivion, though I ask that if you  do, please also take a moment to debunk my points.\n\nI believe  in you, reddit!\n\nEdit: Five days old not two.\n\nEdit 2: Sorry I'm writing like a child, I'm at day 4 ish of a Covid infection and typing with a TV remote keyboard, looking through one eye due to the headache. Also... Positive karma!  Reddit, so pleased to know you can be reasoned with.\n\nEdit 3: **First, thanks for the gold! You truly are the goat.** I'm glad my nerdy ramblings are appreciated. This has got out of hand, have you seen twitter? I would not like to be in OP's position.. twitter is fickle.\n\nSecondly: **Come on, down voters, I challenged, even begged you to debunk my points, not just click and move on! This post has reached 25 about 5 times now, the positive score won't hide you! Won't even one of you speak?**",

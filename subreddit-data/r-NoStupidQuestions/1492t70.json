    "postText": "So for context, I was with the same person for nearly a decade. Because we got together young, it didn't follow the \"traditional\" pattern of a relationship forming. Also she was extremely forward so asked really quickly after we were together if we'd like to be a couple\n\nBasically after that breakup, I think I'm on track to hopefully being in a new relationship with someone I like. I've had to learn about dating and stuff from scratch, but that's all good. I just kind of want to know how the transition from dating to couple usually works because I kinda have no idea, and I actually can't find a great deal online\n\nIs it generally regarded as a certain amount of dates? Maybe something to discuss after being intimate? I know it will be different situation to situation, it's just as someone neurodivergent I just like to go in somewhat prepared for how people 'usually' do things so I can navigate it",

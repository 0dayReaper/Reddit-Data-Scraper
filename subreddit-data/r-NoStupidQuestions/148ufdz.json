I use nothing but; if we have an earthquake, I won\u2019t waste precious water washing rice. It gets spun through a plastic tube to get the sticky starch off that you normally have to wash off several times.\n\n\u201cIn this way of processing, the milled rice goes through one extra step in which it is tumbled in a narrow tube. This small innovation is pretty ingenious, because it uses the adhesiveness of the sticky layer against itself \u2013 during a quick 7-second spin in the tube, the residual bran sticks to the sides of the tube. The rest of the kernel falls away clean, and the waste bran is recovered and sold as fertilizer and animal feed.\u201d",

Whatever value seashells have (obviously very little) would plummet dramatically because value is tied to scarcity -- if the item has no value tied to usefulness.\n\nI think an interesting experiment might be instead -- *what would happen if every single person on the planet got the amount of a paycheck, paid out in potatoes?*\n\nPotatoes are more valuable when they're scarce. But they also can nourish you while being prepared 101 different ways, get you fat, get you drunk, get you other things in trade because at the end of the day they still have caloric value, *and* they can get/grow you even more potatoes.\n\n\n\n[Three hundred seventy-six million tonnes of potatoes are produced globally each year.](https://www.potatonewstoday.com/2023/01/21/global-potato-statistics-latest-fao-data-published)\n\nThat would figure to, roughly, 1,657,874,240,000 8oz potatoes. \n\nDivide that by 8,000,000,000 human people persons, and that's 207+ 8oz potatoes per soul on the planet per year on the planet. \n\nDon't fret about redistributing wealth. Redistribute skins, and starch, and steak fries and Wodka.\n\nInfinitely more valuable than seashells, or leaves, or slips of linen-based paper.\n\nKeep your Fiats and give us all Idaho's finest; we'll happily boil 'em, mash 'em, and stick 'em in a stew.",

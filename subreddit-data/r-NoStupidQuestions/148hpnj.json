    "postText": "Like this is so silly, but it's genuinely getting to me. I feel like every time I try to Google I'll just get search results that aren't related to what I typed at all... like I'll type in Toothpaste for cats and the first results will be toothpaste for dogs. I'll Google a question and try to use as many specific words as possible since apparently it's a niche subject and I'll still get the same results that don't have the stuff I'm looking for. If I had always been this bad at using Google I'd get it, but it has gotten So bad... is this a me thing or did Google like change their algorithm a good while ago or-?\nGenuinely would really appreciate some insight from other people, 'cause it's at the point where I kinda feel like I'm losing it with how surreal it all seems",

Searching for \u201cbest vacuums\u201d gets you some astroturfed top 10 article where every item on the list bribed to be there. Searching \u201cwill there be a Log Horizon Season 3\u201d gives you a bullshit article explaining the history of the series, things people love about it, a story about how the writer grew up in a log cabin in the woods, and at the VERY end: \u201cLog Horizon Season 3 has not been announced\u201d. It\u2019s all just SEO-optimized bullshit to feed you advertisements.\n\nThe two principles at work:\n\n* If your search is controlled by an algorithm, then there will be people who will try to exploit that algorithm, and the risk is high that those people are more interested in driving ads than providing quality content.\n* Advertisements create a conflict of interest for search.\n\nThe most frequently proposed workaround is to add the word \u201creddit\u201d to any and every search query. It works insanely well, because you\u2019re way more likely to get a comprehensive answer that\u2019s 1. written by a human, and 2. voted to be the most reliable answer by readers via Reddit\u2019s upvote system.",

It was super straightforward and showed the results that you wanted. Then everyone started touting the \u201csuperior search results\u201d of Google because it used most popular results as its algorithm instead of most relevant \n\nI tried it, hated it, went back to northern lights. Eventually all other search engines disappeared because Google had them crushed.

No. Convenience of your search result bing all in one place with the option to visit its site of origin if you want.\n\n-The search image tools (like size, type, license filters) barely deliver at best, and I swear there were once an extra large or \"larger than\" option for image size filters before. Now it's just small, medium and large with no idea what constitutes a \"medium\" size\n\nBUT, all of those are manageable and not a problem to get around except for the worst sin of all here:\n\nWhen you search videos through google. Before it was a bunch of links to YouTube or Vimeo where you can go straight to the video. Now many of them are either tik Tok links that you can't even watch without a tik tok account, and worst of all, links to an article or other website that would have the video on it, but no way to just view the video right in Google, (like it only has with YouTube which is highly unnecessary when you can just go straight to the video in YouTube), nor does it take you straight to where the video is in the article links\n\nWhy can't the video results take you right to the video when you click it? Or just open it separately on the search engine? Why do articles and whole news web pages appear as the results in the video only search where the only thing you can easily see from the video is a thumbnail telling you \"It's here, but you have to find it on this website link yourself\"\n\nYou might as well not set the video only filter since it's showing articles anyway, or just search your thing right on YouTube itself (which does work better and I don't  know why those results don't show in google) making the video tab almost useless.",

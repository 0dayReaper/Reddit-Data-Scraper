    "postText": "In English class, a professor told a student she didn\u2019t reference one particular thing on her paper.  She said it is actually from her and if anything it maybe coincidence. Let\u2019s say the student speaking the truth and it\u2019s actually coincidence, many people can have the same thoughts which is pretty normal. Is that still plagiarism? I don\u2019t think everybody is going to google everything they write on their paper so they probably don\u2019t know their idea has already exist and just because you think the same thing but at the later time, you won\u2019t get the credit?",

    "postText": "So i have a friend and their birthday party is June 18. If you didnt know, fathers day is also June 18. So i had to choose; Spend the day with my dad and grandpa, or spend the day with my friend.\nI chose spend the day with my dad and grandpa cause even though i see him every other weekend, its still his day that should be spent with his DAUGHTER. I told my friend \"Hey [], Im really sorry but i cant see you on your birthday. im going to spend the day with my dad and grandpa BUT the next day we can do something fun wherever you want.\". She didnt react well and said \"Girl...it's literally my birthday.\" which i responded with \"okay im still respecting that but its also a day i spend with my family.. Im trying to makeup for it with you so we still have a good time knowing we atleast still celebrated it, even if its just a day later.\". She then left me on read. I have also already bought and given her her birthday gifts bc we went to the mall so i let her go on a mini spree. Am i in the wrong?",

So depending on whether OP is close with their friend it's definitely not an example of the \"birthday month\" type of behaviour to be upset about it",

As it is you chose family over friends which isn't wrong to do, but definitely upsetting for the friend. Birthdays are as significant as holidays as father's days, anniversaries etc so you spending 0% of the time with her and 100% with family shows her your priorities. It's also probably bit of a sensitive topic to her since I imagine it's difficult for her every year to get people to celebrate her birthday with her. I'd imagine it's heartbreaking to year after year have your friends not celebrate your birthday.",

I don't know what the current hay prices are right now, but back when I owned horses I had a three-year contract at $5/bale (small square bales, 40lb - 60lb each) for mixed grass hay with some alfalfa content. Two horses went through a bale of hay every day, so that was about $150/mo. \n\nBUT. That's fairly low quality hay, since my horses were pasture pets, not working animals. These would be \"heavy work\" animals. \n\nHeavy work horses require a much better hay with a higher protein content; probably something like pure alfalfa or an alfalfa/timothy or alfalfa/orchardgrass mix. I just went out to a few of my old hay exchanges and found that pure alfalfa is running between $12-$16 per bale, but you can get an alfalfa mix for $7-$8. Bear in mind that this is a wonky time of year to be looking at hay prices; last year's first cutting is old, which means it's lost a lot of nutrition, and farmers are looking to clear it out in time for the first 2022 cutting (around Memorial Day). So it's going to be cheaper. On the other hand, 2021's third and fourth cutting, while typically less nutritious than 1st or 2nd, is going for high dollar, because the horse owners who didn't plan far enough ahead are going to be a little desperate. \n\n(These prices are central Ohio prices; if you're somewhere like FL, it's going to be *monstrously* more expensive because local conditions for growing hay in FL are shit and most of it gets trucked in from the midwest.  Also bear in mind that feed prices are *highly* variable due to time of year and weather conditions of the current/previous growing season. Too wet or too dry, or just too wet/dry at the wrong times, can have a huge impact.) \n\nAnyway. Making some assumptions and taking some averages, let's say that these two carriage-pulling horses eat a bale of alfalfa/[grass] mix every day, and you'll be paying $9 a bale for that. $270-280 a month.\n\nBut with that kind of work load, you're also going to need to supplement with grain. A cheap 12% sweet feed *is not* going to be sufficient; you're going to need a performance feed like Omolene 200, which is currently going for about $25 for a 50lb bag. Depending on the individual horse and the amount of time they spend pulling the carriage, you're looking at 5lbs-10lbs of grain per day (split into two feedings to avoid colic or founder) per horse. Your two horses will consume a minimum of 10lbs a day, which means that bag will last five days. Add another $150/mo. \n\nThat kind of work is hard on a horse's feet. Carriage-pulling horses *absolutely must* be shod. The cost of horse shoes and regular farrier care is probably going to be over $100 a month (light working animals can get by with a farrier visit every 6-8 weeks, but carriage horses shouldn't go more than 4 weeks between visits). You can save some money if you take some classes and get competent in farrier work; the actual cost of shoes/nails for two horses is pretty negligible, all things considered (but the tools for applying them are going to be a really pricy initial outlay). \n\nIn addition to being hard on their feet, the work is hard on their joints. You'd probably want to add a joint supplement. These prices are all over the board, but you're conservatively looking at $50-$80 a month. \n\nI'm assuming you have your own land, pasture, and barn already, so I'm not including stable and boarding fees, or storage fees for your carriage. \n\nSo right now, we're looking at $585/mo. Not counting any carriage maintenance, just for the horses themselves. \n\n\"But the people back in the 1800s didn't have fancy grain or joint supplements! How did they do it?\" \n\nThe horses broke down and/or died a lot. They replaced their horses much more often, which was feasible since horses weren't tough to buy (as everyone needed them). That's how.\n\nNowadays, if you want a standardbred (the gold standard breed for carriage work) under 20 years old, you're looking at $4k - $5k each (more with good pedigrees and from reputable breeders; I'm getting these prices off a sort of horse Craigslist right now). You probably want to make that minimum $10k investment last a little longer than 4 or 5 years if you're trying to come out even with car ownership and gas prices. \n\nAnd I'm not even going to get into the cost of the carriage. I did a quick search and was finding brand new ones for $14k, and super-old used ones for $3k-$4k (no clue as to the overall quality). And then there's the harness and the associated equipment... altogether, it's probably close to the cost of a low-end new car (in a normal market). \n\nAnd, again, we're assuming you have a barn and enough land to keep them healthy (in Ohio, it's about 1 acre per animal, but we have good grass; down south, it can be much higher due to the local forage quality). \n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!\n\nThe factor of working horse ownership that everyone new to horses fails to consider is the **time** investment. It'll take you well over an hour every time you want to hook up your carriage. You have to brush them so that there's no dust or mats to end up under the harness, you have to check their feet for soundness, you have to do a pre-trip horse inspection, you have to apply the equipment, and you have to get the equipment hooked up to the carriage. If the horses are feeling cooperative that day, it might go faster; if not, it could go much slower. \n\nIt'll take even longer when you unhook them once you get home. In addition to repeating all of the hookup steps in reverse, you'll also have to hotwalk them to let them cool down before you can give them liberty. Ever heard the phrase \"rode hard and put away wet?\" That's not (originally) a sex metaphor, it's a horse metaphor. If you just drop your horses in the barn while they're still sweaty, there are some pretty scary potential health consequences. \n\nThat's not counting cleaning their stalls (oh, hell, I forgot to apply the monthly cost of stall bedding. Well, fuck it), feeding them, exercising them on days they're not pulling your carriage, and keeping their training fresh. \n\nAll in all, it's an expensive, time-consuming process. There's a very good reason we switched to cars.",

The cheapest hay is usually:\n\nFor low-quality hay: Right before hay harvesting season, when hay growers are trying to empty any remaining stock of last year's hay before the new harvest comes in.\n\nFor high-quality hay: During or right after hay harvesting season, when hay growers might have more on hand than they can store in their barn, so they're eager to sell some off quickly.\n\n---\n\nAnd by region ... well, that's awfully complex. And it also varies in time, since some regions have earlier or later, longer or shorter growing seasons. It can also vary year to year if one region has a particularly good or bad growing season.\n\nBut the differences between regions can be *huge*.\n\nLast year, I personally made about $5000 (*after* fuel and expenses) by traveling to the area around Seattle, buying a truckload of hay there for about $100/ton, then hauling it to Spokane, where I sold it for around $400/ton. With the truck and trailer I had, I could make about $1000 profit on each run, and each run only took me 1 day. And all of that was just because the weather patterns had made hay expensive in the Spokane area at the time, but the Seattle area had gotten a good growing season and had plenty.",

That engineering comes with a lot of costs though, like their hooves being part of their circulatory system (basically they almost have an auxiliary heart in each foot) and their guts sloshing around like that actually helps them breathe enough during exertion to get enough oxygen to function--if they had to rely on a diaphragm like we do they'd die every time we expected them to run full out for a mile. Horses are built to do what horses do and that makes them both strong and fragile--blame evolution!",

Their vision works completely different from ours, so what we see is \u201cobviously\u201d just a shadow or tarp or whatever isn\u2019t necessarily so for a horse. Plus they are prey animals, so the instinct to flee has propagated in their genes for literally hundreds of thousands of years, if not more. That won\u2019t be overcome just through training alone. Not to mention the flightiness of a horse varies greatly by breed and individual personality. Some warm blood breeds who are very athletic come off as air headed and \u201cdumb\u201d, but they have literally been bred to be that way by people, so that is hardly the horse\u2019s fault. \n\nAlso, through my work with horses over years, the idea of them kicking out over nothing is hugely exaggerated. Horses never kick out at someone or something for no reason. They are extremely perceptive and are oftentimes picking up on things people around them don\u2019t even notice, or things their handler is doing without realizing. As you develop a trained eye for horse body language you start to realize how many of those videos out there on the internet of \u201chorses behaving badly\u201d are horses and people having a really bad communication breakdown. \n\nI hope I don\u2019t come off as rude, I\u2019m not trying to start a fight! I just always cringe internally when people call horses \u201cstupid\u201d for behaving like a horse is supposed to. They are actually really intelligent, trusting, and make wonderful companions for many people \ud83d\ude0a",

Prey animal perspective is just to treat everything with the utmost caution, it doesn't make sense to us - but panic and run in the face of new things is the best strategy for them when every day is a risk of being eaten, and it certainly doesnt mean they're stupid.\n\nAnyone who thinks horses are dumber than other domestic animals has never actually worked with them. I mean they build stable doors with bolts that are out of reach because of how easily they learn to open and unlock things. And they are so perceptive. They know exactly how much they can push a human, they know when they can take the piss and they can totally judge your intentions. But they aren't as focused on you and as eager to please just for the sake of it as dogs and other animals are are so they get lambasted to the bottom of the domestic animal intelligence list for no good reason.",

Otherwise you gotta buy a young horse and train it yourself before you can even use it, and that takes a few years. \n\nGotta get that horse a harness, that's a few grand right there. \n\nCarriages are also a few grand depending on what style you get.\n\nBoarding is probably a few hundred a month on the cheap side. \n\nGotta find a place to keep the carriage safe from the elements. Spend some more money to build a shed. \n\nIf you're boarding your horse, you'll have to drive to the boarding stables anyways. Then you have to trailer the horse into the city because it would take you hours to get from the country to work if you just rode the horse. So now you'll need a trailer which will eat up more gas. \n\n\n\nAt this point why not just walk or get an electric bike or moped??",

There is no road they can't use. Stores like Wal-Mart have sheds for them to tie their horses and trash cans and shovels for horse shit.\n\nThey were against lights on their buggies due to not wanting to stick out but state gvnmt passed laws requiring them and recently they have come to embrace them.  You think it's scary in a car with all the idiots on the road the Amish in their small buggies have 18 wheelers flying by inches from them and their horses. \n\nEdit: Minimum speed limits are the exception to road use. Don't think that there are any 45 mph horses.",

How are you going to get there? Now you're looking at a barn and acreage to keep it at home. $$$ Now you need a small tractor, dumpster for all the feed bags and manure, fencing (which will put you back $5000 alone for a 100' by 100' space)\nHay: $12-$15 a bale. 1 bale lasts about 2 days. \nFarrier: $70-$170 every six weeks. \nVet: hope it doesn't get sick or hurt. $100 minimum if you call out a vet.\nInsurance (yep.): $400 a year for basic. \nHarness:$1200\nCarriage: $10,000 (I've seen them for less.. rarely)\nDon't want to deal with hooking them up?:\nSaddle: $2000 that is good quality. \nHeadstall/bit: $100 or more\nNeeds a bit of refresh on its training: $900 per month (most places are a minimum of 30 days). \nEnjoyment you'll get out of having a horse: priceless. \n\nNot to get too deep here, but our costs are increasing too. Fuel goes up, hay prices go up. \n\nLong story short, buy the BMW. You'll save money.",

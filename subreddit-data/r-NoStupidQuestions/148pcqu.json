Workers in Europe after the Black Death were able to earn more money for the same reasons. \n\nHowever this may not extend to all professions. Outsourcing and technology could further reduce the need for workers, and \u201cunskilled\u201d laborers will have a higher supply than other industries. \n\nIt would take organization from workers since no company would willingly pay more. So the answer is maybe. In simple economics the answer should be yes, but outside factors make it impossible to determine for certain",

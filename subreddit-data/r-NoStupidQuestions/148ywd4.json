The process can be expensive, the storage can be expensive over time and the success rates of pregnancy with egg freezing in particular aren't great if I recall correctly. Not only that, but egg retrieval is an intense process of taking female hormones and undergoing intimate procedures which were not something I felt I would be able to cope with.",

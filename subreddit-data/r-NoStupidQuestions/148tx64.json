            "comment": "Everything radiates energy to some degree, though solar panels are specifically designed to absorb energy radiated by the sun. Despite this design, one could reverse the process to make them emit energy instead of absorbing it. On a fundamental level a solar panel is just an array of LEDs. An LED's ability to convert electricity into light actually goes both ways its just that unlike the ones used in lights and TVs the ones in solar panels are more efficient at converting light into electricity.\n\nIn short, no, Solar panels do not radiate energy but they could be easily rigged to do so in a very inefficient manner.",

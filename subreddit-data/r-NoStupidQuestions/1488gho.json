You still have all of your emotions at full capacity, you feel like yourself, you have a slightly heightened sex drive, you sleep like a baby, and food tastes better. It works incredibly for both my anxiety and depression. Honestly I'm baffled why more doctors don't prescribe it. But yeah if you're sick of the usual SSRI bullshit then maybe try this one.

I was constantly checking it and everything revolved around my minoxidil schedule. Then after a couple years the baldness comes back while still desperately using minoxidil and people notice that you're quickly losing hair. It's totally not worth it.\n\nI think I'm also left with permanent scalp issues now from years of minoxidil :( I wish I just buzzed off my hair instead. It's so freeing not to worry about my hair anymore. I can focus on life and other things instead of always thinking about how my hair looks.",

Then over time hair dries out, you get flakes from dry scalp, and hair looks dead no matter what conditioner you use. Then hair loss eventually gets worse over time, and if you stop completely then all of the hair you gained falls out.\n\nIt definitely works better for some than others, but I just stopped caring about my hair as much. It was so debilitating to constantly worry about hair when in reality most people don\u2019t care. And if they do they\u2019re not really worth being around.\n\nI can just say thankfully that all of the side effects went away after about a week. Probably a good 5-6 years since I\u2019ve been on it and haven\u2019t had any chest pain since.",

I asked my doctor for 50mg pills when I was ready to come off them. I dropped to 75mg for 2 weeks, then 50mg, then 25mg. Each time at 2 weeks. I took 25mg every other day when I was dropping to 0mg, then every 2 days before I stopped. Only on the first drop did I notice any side effects and they were nowhere  near as bad as when I started. Sexual side effects improved about 2-3 months after I stopped altogether. Make sure you have other cooing mechanisms and support systems in place for afterwards. Know that some days will be sad days, bad days and rough days. And that's ok. Feel every emotion - good and bad. Be kind to yourself and keep talking. Take care from a Sister ;)",

I do remember they tried me on a couple others beforehand but they *really* screwed me up so I wasn't on them long. No more than 2-3 months each. Man, that was hellish. Sertraline seemed to level me out rather than exacerbate things, so I've been on it ever since. I still remember getting pretty worried that I may have ED once that side of things kicked in.

Forms of hormonal birth control are a good example of this; they are also used to prevent ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and other issues related to menstrual cycles, as well as acne, PCOS, etc.\n\nA personal example: I'm taking an anti-psychotic medication atm because it's been found to help with extreme insomnia.  I had a sleep-deprivation induced seizure last October.  This has been the only thing I've tried that's reliably helped me sleep, and it's usually given to people to help with schizophrenia from what I understand (I don't experience psychosis ftr).\n\nEdit: Considering I am getting messages from people with similar problems? The name of the drug I am on (and it is helping, a LOT) is Quetiapine, 100 mg tablets, I can take 1 or 2.",

Getting to sleep is incredibly hard, staying asleep is a coin toss, and waking up is incredibly unpleasant due to the exhaustion.  It wavers in terms of severity, but around the time of the seizure I was sleeping a few hours (like 4-5) every 3 days or so on average, sometimes it extended into 4 days and that was terrible, and this was a prolonged pattern over the course of several months.  Tbh I'm not surprised I had a seizure even though I didn't know insomnia could cause that, I felt like I was dying already.  The longest singular instance of no sleep at all that I've had was 5 days, though that was in... 2005 I think?\n\nThe thing is that I can't really pinpoint one cause.  Part of it is that my mind just won't stop taking in stimulus.  I use blackout curtains and fans to disrupt as much sensory input as possible so my mind can't latch onto anything, but it only solves part of the problem, because even if I can stop my thoughts from keeping me up... my body just won't go to sleep.  It's very hard to describe.  It's like being trapped at the edge of sleep and the part of your body that's autonomic just refuses to take that final step over.  I'm also not sure what wakes me up mid-sleep either, and I almost never remember dreaming, sometimes I go years without remembering a single dream.\n\nSo yeah, sleep and I have a complicated relationship lol.",

And I REALLY dislike how certain things basically gaurentee not sleeping, then not sleeping tends to really fuck up the next day and night. It definitely makes it way harder to cope with everything else, which makes it much harder to sleep. I rarely get 0 sleep multiple nights in a row, but I went long periods where it was 1-3 hours every night for LONG times. Its better recently as I have improved other things.\n\nWhat did it feel like?

Although if you\u2019re on asenapine or olanzapine that\u2019s different. \n\nThe psych drugs kind of get labeled these things when they\u2019re not really totally apt descriptions for example \u201cantidepressants\u201d probably would be more accurately named anti anxiety meds cause they\u2019re arguably better at that. And antipsychotics often get used in depression, bipolar, for anxiety and sleep etc where there is no psychosis. their name leads to this being criticized and some points are valid because they can have serious, irreversible side effects but sometimes it\u2019s just fixation the name",

Yet if I\u2019m awake with pain and take it, I not only sleep immediately but wake up feeling incredible and almost completely renewed, is the best way to describe it.

Yet that\u2019s the opposite of how you can feel if you take it recreationally too often.\n\nWith most drugs, if you have a need for it then it will work miracles, but if you don\u2019t and are only taking it for fun then be prepared because you might be in for a hell of a time.",

It seems that this is an extremely effective medication for weight loss (I am assuming you are starting wegovy?).

Now that I\u2019m thinking about it, talking to a dietician would be best, since semaglutide is so effective as an appetite suppressant, that many people lose bone density and experience hair loss, because they lose weight so fast.\n\nSo, you need to create a healthy sustainable diet plan before you take this drug imo, because the reports of unprepared people facing problems after using it as a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d are piling.\n\n(Sorry if I made any mistakes.

It breaks one's dopamine shackles to junk foods, and prevents 'hangry' situations where you make rash choices and regret them later. On the meds, food in general is not given the power to influence that it had otherwise, plus you clearly feel crappy when you ignore body signals and overindulge.\n\nIf all you do on the medicine is use it as a simple appetite suppressant, though, and never change your relationship to food, you're going to quickly regain the weight when you stop taking it. (It's a short-term medicine you take over a couple of years, not designed to be a daily medicine for life.)",

However, it is EXTREMELY dangerous and can lead to organ failure and death if you take too much in one day.\n\nSame with Lithium, which is an element and a drug used for depression.

            "comment": "Shrooms. I was listening to a podcast at work today and it was interviewing the man who built GoDaddy.com.\n\n\nI wasn't listening to it for this part and it took me completely by surprise when he talked about it.\n\n\nBasically this man has been to war. Seen friends get killed and killed others as well. It created a crazy amount of PTSD for him. That affected his life for the worse and ruined his relationships and was ruining his life. He had heard shrooms may help. So he went to Hawaii for a 3 day therapeutic \"trip.\" He was basically going to trip all 3 days. He took more than they recommended. And he said by the end of it all. He had finally come back from the war. YEARS later. Said there were so many tears, so many breakthroughs, and so many revelations, that he had finally come back home from the war.\n\n\nTo me that's crazy af. I have been taking shrooms and acid every once in awhile these past 6 months. It inspired me to quit my job because I felt so stuck in my shitty job that contributed to a shitty life. It's helped me somewhat in my relationship, and I'm still working on it. It's caused me not to give a single fuck about what others are doing and comparing myself to them. Now instead I'm inspired by what others are doing. I haven't been as anxious and I feel more grounded. \n\n\nI really do believe when shrooms are going to be more heavily investigated. That you will see shrooms as a normal thing in life. I really believe that. You could fix a lot of people with those lil fuckers.",

    "postText": "Hi!  Every day I change my underwear but since I don't do wash myself more than once or twice a week could that be why I keep getting UTIs? The nether regions are still not clean even if I'm throwing a new pair of underwear over it so would that cause UTIs when I don't have them? I'd like to know cause it's annoying always having to pee.\n\nI was wondering how important is it to clean yourself everyday if you always get UTIs? Changing underwear everyday isn't enough? How often do I need to shower? I'd really prefer not everyday.",

(This is very common)\n\nIf you are male and you get recurrent uti see your dr for investigation, as male uti is much harder to get and may mean something else is wrong. \n\nI work in urgent care",

You probably have a lot of body odor that you've gotten used to, but other people can smell. \n\nHave you been going to the doctor and getting antibiotics for every UTI? They don't usually go away on their own. If you haven't had antibiotics, you've probably just had one UTI this whole time that gets better and worse. Getting it treated is important, because it can move up to your kidneys and cause serious issues.",

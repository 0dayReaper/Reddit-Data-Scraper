    "postText": "I have talked to a lot of siblings and it seems that there's always one that gets a slightly different treatment, even if it's an unconscious behaviour from the parents. \nDo you simply know that you are the favorite child?\nAlso, how does it feel being the favorite or the least favorite? Or do you feel like your parents don't have a favorite and that there are only some personality traits that you have that they are more drawn to, so therefore there are some others that they are more compatible and that your siblings have? \nWhen/how did you get to that conclusion? \n\nSorry if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language so I would appreciate if everyone could be a little understanding.",

            "comment": "&gt;When/how did you get to that conclusion\n\nwell, my dad said it accidentally, under extreme emotional conditions. I never repeated it to anybody.  neither did he.  \n\n&gt;how does it feel being the favorite \n\nI actually got away with less because I was expected/assumed to be such a \"good\" kid.  pedestals are limiting spaces. \n  I'm in huge debt to my sibs for their generosity not holding it against me.   there's no question among us that our parents were devoted to all of us.   it's just my dad and I \"got\" each other just naturally.   \n\nat the end of his life I tried to pay that back.  I *was* the \"best\" person to take on most of his care, so I did.   my family are pretty neat, imo.",

If you don't mind me asking, how did you deal with it?\nIn my personal view, I think that it must be conflicting acknowledge that our parents may not be impartial and get driven by their emotions since they are not only our parents but also humans with flaws.",

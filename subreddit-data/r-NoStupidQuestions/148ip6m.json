It wasn\u2019t even late, it was delivered BEFORE the estimated delivery date.\n\nI think the delivery guy had marked it as undeliverable by mistake.",

It's been over a year now, and nothing. It happens, I doubt they would even care to waste the time and resources to try and prove otherwise.",

Perhaps they will never find out about it. If you are honest you could contact Amazon support and tell them you already received the package and are not entitled to a refund. If you are not honest, you could just hope they don\u2019t catch the mistake and that you can keep the item and your money.",

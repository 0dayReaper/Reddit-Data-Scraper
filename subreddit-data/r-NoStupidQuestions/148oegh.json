Severe trauma causes severe anxiety and PTSD where you are overly sensitive and reliving the event and all of the sensations you had originally. \n\nOther traumas cause people to become callous or avoidant as a defense mechanism.   You're not really desensitized, you just avoid and distance yourself from anyone/anything that makes you feel uncomfortable before it rises to the level of reliving your traumas.",

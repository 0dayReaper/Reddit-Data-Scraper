Many states will try and tax it out of existence. IN New York City, a carton of cigarettes is now around $175. New York's theory is among the stupidest theory around. Raise the taxes to 'discourage' smoking and then use that tax money to fund public programs. Problem is that smokers will find their tobacco in other places-like Indian Reservations. And then when that money Doesn't materialize, they raise it again to overcome the tax shortfall.  The Governor just raised the tax Another $10 per carton to fund a shortfall of public funds.",

If you hang around friends who smoke, you will be compelled to smoke again. If your environment has smokers or 2nd hand smoke, you will likely start again. If your environment produces stress... you will combat that by smoking.\n\nI could go on. As they say with meth... not even once. Personally when starting I find the first one to two cigarettes or vapes the best you'll ever inhale. Past that, the nicotine rush drops 99.999% but the addiction jumps 10000%.",

I still smoke daily, maybe 1 or 2, and then stop for months once I finish the pack of tobacco which usually lasts a month. I've never craved it nor considered myself addicted, but my sister and her husband are heavy smokers and I've seen them try to quit multiple times. Both my grandfather's were heavy smokers. One died from emphysema and the other from lung cancer. I guess the addiction is dependent on the person, but I'm an avid fitness enthusiast (runner, cycling, gym) which might help me curb addiction.

In that time I picked up an alcohol, coke and heroin addiction in my late teens and through a lot of patience was able to get clean of those substances. I skipped out of rehab when quitting because I didn't like their attempt to convert me to religion.\n\nBut, at 38 I've been trying to quit smoking for over 10 years and it's so hard. I use the gum, patches, and so much more. Smoking is a curse for me, and ridiculously hard habit to break. I can never have \"Just one\" on a night out, it will result in a pack a day or to break it down to pure money, that works out as \u20ac5,856 just for smoking. \n\nI am so happy my own teenagers are disgusted by the idea of smoking or vaping and have become those very kids that tell their friends to not do it and give out to them when they do. \n\nI'm on my most recent attempt to quit, it's been about a month and I ache for them. Any little inconvenience my brain is telling me to go buy a pack to help relieve the stress of the situation.",

Done forever.  Fuck this shit.  I'm so tired of this addiction.\n\n10am:  (Smoking my last cigarette) My chest hurts, my throat hurts, I have to quit this.  Its literally killing me.  I can feel my insides protesting.\n\n11am:  (just after eating lunch) Man I really want a cigarette, but I know that's just the addiction talking.  My throat still hurts and i'm still congested from the last one I smoked.  I'm gonna be strong and quit for real this time.\n\n11:30am: (I'm at the gas station buying cigarettes) This is so fucking stupid, I said I wasn't going to do this.  I fucking hate smoking, I fucking hate cigarettes, I just want to quit.  More than anything I just want to quit this stupid habit.\n\nRinse and repeat about 48 hours from then.\n\nImagine your brain telling you something is bad, knowing its bad, hating it with every fiber of your being, and then all of a sudden you're doing that thing you hate and you can't stop.\n\nImagine getting angry at your loved ones (son, daughter, wife) for hassling you about it when you know they're right and you agree with them.\n\nIts literally like having another person living in your body with you, controlling you and making you do things you don't want to do.",

Cocaine was almost too easy for me to give up, alcohol was much harder and I still haven't quit smoking cigarettes. So far, nicotine is the hardest substance to rid your body of to me. But I will say this- Marijuana addiction does have some really annoying withdrawals. Nothing serious or compounding but for me, the few times I've given up weed for a long spell, my sleep is fucked. My dreams are INSANE and keep me up all night and anytime I was just sitting around watching TV or something, I really craved the high. I had to go back to smoking weed to kill my dreams and sleep again.",

While society has done a good job of changing the narrative around smoking, a lot of people seem to view people who smoke as lesser, which is not the case. \n\nQuitting is one of the hardest things ever and the habit is awful. Besides the known long-term effects and how it slowly kills you, the other things like the lingering smell on your fingers, face, and clothes, fucking with your appetite, food and drinks not tasting as good, and the easy potential to litter all make it \u201cthat bad.\u201d\n\nI smoked for 8 years and finally quit cold turkey almost 2 years ago. The first two weeks were quite difficult, but the difference was that I actually wanted to quit. I also did not put as much pressure on myself to succeed which for some reason worked (didn\u2019t throw away my smokes for the first week so I wouldn\u2019t panic about not having any then go buy a fresh pack and then smoke all of it to \u201cnot waste it\u201d, also made it seem like I was in control and just choosing not to smoke but still could if I really wanted to).\n\nI do not miss it one bit. Best way to quit is to never start, but holy shit I feel so much better in every way after not smoking for nearly 2 years.",

Best thing is i like smoking, the ritual of rolling and letting my mind rest on a smoke break at work. The movement of my hand when i take a puff. All of that added up makes me content even though i know its really not good for me. I told myself ill give up smoking if ill have some medical condition or find a woman who will not want to kiss me cause i smell like an ashtray. Well i got medical condition and all women i end up with are smokers themselves. As you can see its quite problematic",

As some others have mentioned, COPD (in very basic terms a severe lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema), can force someone to live off of an oxygen tank a be miserable. Aside from that, it increase your stroke risk, risk for the following cancers: lung, pancreas, esophagus, kidney, bladder, mouth. It also increases your risk for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, essentially the blood vessel in your abdomen supplied blood rips open (it\u2019s bad). Plus weird things you wouldn\u2019t expect like increase arthritis risk and so many others. \n\nThat being said, stopping smoking or any other drug for that matter is HARD. If you\u2019re interested in quitting, try finding a doctor who is knowledgeable about substance use and willing to help or find people you know who have successfully quit to be there for you!\n\nEDIT: \nI also think a lot of people go \u201ccold turkey\u201d which tends to only work for a small amount of people. Slowly tapering down and being aware of when you smoke, who you smoke with, why you smoke, etc, is essential. There will also be good days and bad days, so give yourself credit where it is due!",

It got so bad that the effort required to eat made them short of breath, and the effort to breathe sapped all the calories they did manage to take in. My father-in-law is heading down that same path right now. Ever see a fish out of water? That's what these people look like towards the end.\n\nI've been in healthcare for 26 years. I've lost count of the number of patients I've seen with lung cancer, COPD, and heart disease directly related to smoking. It can not only shorten your life, but make the last years of it miserable.",

Don't get me wrong: a psychological addiction is hell and fucking hard to quit.\nI smoked a pack every day for 8 years and I was very very addicted. I thought about smoking all day long. A 2h wait somewhere where smoking is forbidden was really tough; a 7h airplane travel was a nightmare.\n\nI tried for years to quit, every single time the symptoms of withdrawal was awful.\nAnd one day, I wasn't even trying to quit, but I knew it was over. I gave my pack to a friend and I had zero symptoms. I'm not sure what happened, maybe I heard once again about how terrible it is for your health, maybe I saw once again one of this picture of rotten lungs.\nAlso, I didn't made the connection back in the days, but I had just stopped going to parties where everybody smoked all the day long. And I was alone at home all the day long, so no one could tempt me. It really made a huge difference. Smoking is a very social behaviour.",

    "postText": "I bought a new 10tb HDD since my 2tb one is five years old. I want to move all the files from the 2tb to the 10tb one. I see software is willing to do this for me, but its pricey and it occured to me: why can't I just copy/paste the files from the 2tb HDD to the 10tb?\n\nIf the 10tb one has the same drive letter and the same name it should have the same file paths... right? Same file paths means when the PC is trying to run something, it will look in the 10tb path rather than the 2tb path (which I would obviously rename to something else after) Then again if its this simple I must be missing something since these drive cloning programs are a really big industry. People must be paying money for it for a reason...\n\nSo thats my stupid tech question. Will this work as easily as I imagined? Did I just learn the secret billion dollar tech companies do not want me to know, or am I just a dope missing the obvious? Help me out /r/NoStupidQuestions!",

But I'm pretty sure that if you press the install button and then change the desired directory to the existing one, Steam will do a quick check of what's in that folder and know the game is installed there.",

            "comment": "There are normally two timestamps associated with each file. One is the last-modified time, which will stay the same on the copied files. The other is the file creation time, which will probably be set to when you made the copy, not the date the file was created on the original drive. If knowing when you got a file is not important to you, don't worry about it.\n\nSomeone mentioned file shortcuts. Those won't be a problem because they are treated as the .lnk files that they actually are. But if you use hard links or junction points, you will probably want to take special care to make sure they are preserved, instead of treated na\u00efvely like the files and folders they pretend to be. If this is just a \"data\" drive (not boot drive with your OS on it), and you don't know what hard links or junction points are, then you probably aren't using them, and it's fine.\n\n\"Cloning\" will make an *exact* copy of the drive, byte for byte, which will preserve everything perfectly, including fragmentation, hidden partitions, and the part of the drive that is needed during bootup (if the drive is bootable). Cloning can be done with free software, but yes, it's a big industry for the replacement drive market.\n\nFor copying, rather than cloning, on Windows, you might try using [https://fastcopy.jp/](https://fastcopy.jp/) ... I have had good luck with it.",

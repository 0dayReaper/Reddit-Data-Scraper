A lot of people still get stuck in thinking that big companies will never change, but this wave is one that's actually continuing to gain momentum. If enough companies start moving to these models there will eventually be a tipping point where it becomes more of a default than an outlier. People just need to keep pushing. Covid, for all of its terrible results, did actually manage to do some good too. It's often said to never give the mouse a cookie when it comes to your job, like taking on extra tasks for no pay increase. Employers were forced to suddenly give out bags of cookies though, and the mice are starting to demand that glass of milk",

I think the only reason i do now is because i can't study without any online material, especially cuz of the pandemic. Otherwise i still might not have had it. The main reason for no internet was because my dad didn't want my older brother to use it(he kept using it while studying), and if he gave it to me then my brother would just ask me or use the device anyway, cuz they were common devices (as in we both used 1 iPad or whatever). I was allowed to use the internet a bit in the 6th grade, that's because there was this online math thing, where you gain points for getting questions right. I remember using that as an excuse to talk to my friends over hangouts. And oh boy was i brain-dead when it came to using anything there lmao.\nAnd i think sometimes I would gain the courage to ask my dad for internet on the iPad, only for like an hour, and i used to play clash royale.\n\nThere were a couple of years, i think my brother's 10th through 12 grade where my dad just took away ALL of the devices, because my brother majorly screwed up with something, i don't remember. And we would gain the courage to ask for the devices back right when summer break started and my dad let us.\n\nWhat was the topic again?\nOh yeah, no i don't get any privacy in my room\n\nedit: i can't wait to go to college",

I've worked nights most of my adult life, so I'm regularly awake til 3-4am. On my days off I get excited to go to bed at 10 or 11pm because daylight is such a precious resource to me now that I have a garden, a workshop, dogs to train plus other various outdoor hobbies and responsibilities.\n\nIn my 20's before I could buy a house all I could really do with my time is play video games and watch TV. I didn't have the space for a workshop or a garden or anything else and I was miserable. All daylight meant to me then was people calling me and asking me to do things I didn't want to do. Now that I'm older I've realized I can just say no or pretend I'm sleeping and not pick up the phone.",

Just 5 24oz glasses of water.\n\nI just got home (its 1:29am EST as of posting) and I feel absolutely refreshed and I'm considering going for a run or something because it feels (slightly) more productive than playing the video game I just bought.\n\nAnd I never feel refreshed after.

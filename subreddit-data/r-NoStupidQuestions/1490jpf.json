    "postText": "They kept marijuana illegal for so long on the basis that it was dangerous and addictive. People who knew it wasn\u2019t knew and people who didn\u2019t just accepted what they were told. When it comes to heroin and cocaine I know that me, as an individual, would use it recreationally if it were completely free of other additives.  They are either cut with fentanyl or really harmful water soluble powders that can pass for the drugs they\u2019re mixed with. \n\n\n\nThat said, where\u2019s the money for finding a drug that\u2019s as dangerous as marijuana edibles but feel like an opioid or stimulant?",

            "comment": "The additives are not the only issue. Any drug that makes you feel good for no reason other than \"you took the drug\" is going to be dangerous because of that. That necessarily messes up the way your brain processes rewards and pleasure. You don't need anything else to get effects like addiction, depression, or learning disabilities.",

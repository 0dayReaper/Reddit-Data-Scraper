Perhaps that makes you feel some kind of betrayal of trust. As for as the toys, perhaps you are afraid that she won\u2019t need you anymore if she can get off with toys. Or maybe that she would prefer a toy to you - or some other form of insecurity.\n\nYour best bet is just very frank an open conversation with her. Before that, try to understand where these feelings are coming from. You might be feeling a combination of things from different sources. You just need to do some introspection. Once you know the cause and you can hopefully work with her to resolve it.",

I mean im using porn too .. way to much. I kind of start to think that she abuse it as much as i do .. and yes when i see what for example the newest satisfyer pro can do to a woman im really afraid that this little piece of metal and rubber can easily offer her better orgasms in less time and its for her its really comfortable because she has nothing to do in return \ud83d\ude1e",

Unless she is, but even then she's probably not that in the bedroom with you.  \n\nThere is so much more to sex than the orgasm.  For a lot of people, sex is about the connection to the person you're having sex with, which she can't get from a toy.  It's about your partner, the partner's, hearing *their* sounds, feeling *their* hands, *their* mouth, *their* body, and watching *them* experience you in the same way. \n\nYes, whatever toys she uses can have all these features and gizmos attached, but they will never be *you,* and you can bring a lot to the table that the toy never could.  The toys are just pieces of metal, rubner, and plasctic.  You're a living, human being that she chooses to be with because of whatever connection you have, and that is important during sex.",

If she was using it exclusively, and not doing anything sexual with you, then I can understand your trepidation\u2026 but she can\u2019t have an emotional relationship with her vibrator. Sounds like you might need to go to therapy, which is not a bad thing. Not at all. More people should go to therapy\u2026 but talking about it with a professional can help you understand why you are feeling the way you are feeling and what you can do to change your thought processes. It sounds like you are off to a great start though.",

    "postText": "I heard with dogs you should be able to feel their ribs but not see their ribs. That if you can't feel their ribs, they're too fat and being over fed and if you can see their ribs they're too skinny and being under fed. What doesn't make sense about this is I feed my dog regular meals and I can always see his ribs despite being well fed.",

If you have any questions, you can either take him to the vet, or if doesn\u2019t seem that crucial, bring it up at his next checkup.",

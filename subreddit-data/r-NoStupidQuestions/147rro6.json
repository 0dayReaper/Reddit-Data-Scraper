You can do cheaper, but I'm not shooting for a *Supersize Me* lifestyle here.\n\nAlso, I'd feel sick eating restaurant food all the time.

I was the chef of the restaurant and had free room and board, house keeping, laundry service etc. It was the best ten years of my life. \n\nThe hotel was on a sleepy surf beach and only had 14 rooms. I read books, surfed, jogged on the beach and smoked pot all day. \n\nI'm in in NY now with a wife and 4 kids and seriously thinking about doing it again but with the whole family.",

I had designed some simple wind powered auger presses to extract coconut oil without using electricity or fossil fuels and moved to NY to work and raise money for the project with the objective to move back to CR within 2 years to start a small coconut oil company. \n\nI met a girl within a few months of being back in NY (she had a 5 year old) and since then we have had 3 kids in 5 years. Covid, kids, job instability, cost of living, health insurance etc... You know, American dream stuff...have kept us in NY for longer than anticipated. \n\nWe won't move back until we have enough money saved to open our own little eco resort in the mountains, so it will be some time. \n\nI had originally moved to CR in my mid twenties with $100 cash and a backpack, a pair of flip flops, a swimsuit, a pair or shorts and a couple of white t-shirts. I was a broke kid who decided that I would rather be broke on the beach than broke in the snow. It was the best decision I ever made.\n\nMoving back to NY was a horrible decision. But I did get a wonderful wife and a slew of children out of it. I just can't wait to move back and raise my kids in the jungle, far far away from all the BS that's going on daily in the United States. I hate it here.",

It was 2005 so the housing market was insane before the crash.\n\nWe did not want to sign a lease on a new place in case we found something.  We did not want to move our stuff out of storage then back in.\n\nWe found a residence inn near the neighborhood where we wanted to live.  The long term rent (minimum 3 months, but still cancelable with 24 hours notice) was only about 20% more than a comparable apartment.  It was two bed, two bath, utilities, housekeeping, furnishings, repairs, cable TV, internet, and breakfast all included...and still I could check out at any time.\n\nTook us a year to find a place, closed, moved our stuff in, and checked out.\n\nFunny thing is, while we were staying there, we actually went on vacation!  We kept paying the room because we did not want to risk getting a different room when we came back (and reset the three month discount clock).\n\nWe also have lifetime status with that chain and for the year after, I got the greatest looks from hotel staff when I checked in, because I had the absolute highest status and many had never seen that before.\n\nOne time I went to a newer hotel in the chain, hotel was new and the staff was new.  Probably only open for a month.  I went to check in and said I think the travel agent forgot to add my member number to my booking (this was true, it was a last minute trip).  I gave my number... instant mini-chaos.  I could see the wheels turning and panic set in.  There were special ways they were supposed to greet me l and weird stuff like that which I did not care for anyway.  I told her, it is okay, just give me the extra points for the award and I will go up to my room.  I think she was supposed to offer me an upgrade room but I had already checked in, and was traveling alone anyway, so I did not care.",

I also didn\u2019t keep much in the way of personal items with me at the hotel, other than clothes, and lightning that load was also oddly freeing. Luckily, my hotel rooms were always quite nice, though not very large or in super grand hotels. All had at least a microwave and sink for cooking, and a small refrigerator. Having a house keeping was really great. My biggest problem living long-term in a hotel was the lack of laundry facilities in some of the residences.",

It's pretty nice really, other than having to pay for the room, which wouldn't be the case in your scenario, I had nothing to worry about. It was a basic room with bed, TV, kettle with free coffee and tea, and a bathroom with shower, toilet, sink. So no fridge so I could have proper milk in my hot drinks and bowl of cereal in the morning which sucked but I just went out and bought other ready made food out or takeaway for other meals. It isn't cheap to do it this way as no kitchen or fridge means you can't store or prepare other food. I did my clothes washing at a local store which had the machines outside. They cost about \u00a330 for a 20kg load washed, dried with soaps and softners. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't have a problem being in this situation again but I'm single with no kids so that makes my situation a lot simpler than others",

            "comment": "There is a reason some people do this exact thing. By the numbers:\n\nIf rent is, say, $1700/month (average nationally), and utilities are another $250 (national average), that's $1950/month right there, or $65/day.\n\nAdd free housekeeping, maintenance, etc. for another, let's say, $250 per month. Also, if the hotel has a pool and a gym, add another $75 for those two things.\n\nPlus, hotels are usually located far closer to the middle of a town than houses are, so you are within walking distance of most places. If you are smart about buses and trams and stuff, no need for a car, so take off car maintenance and gas costs (that's like $300/month right there). and you've probably got a average monthly savings of roughly $400, including oil changes and the yearly maintenance that costs like $700. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far, we're at around $2675/month, or $89.50/day, which is approaching the lower end of hotels. (I've stayed at budget hotels/motels that are as low as $55/night, but I would not live there.)\n\nBut it keeps going. If the hotel has a free breakfast like most do, that's 1/3 of your daily meals taken care of. The average monthly food cost is around $400 for one person, so 1/3 of that is around $133. \n\nThat brings us to around $2811, or $93.7/night. The fancy 3-star hotel I stayed in overlooking the Arch was $160/night.\n\nBut we are still missing some things: namely, discounts. Any hotel worth it's salt will have a rewards program for frequent stayers. You would be surprised how quickly you accumulate points.\n\nOne final thing: In most states, you are legally a tenant after a specified time period of continual occupancy with no attempts to evict. So if you stay in a hotel room for a month or two, you are legally no longer a guest who can be kicked out at will. You are, in essence, a daily renter of an apartment.",

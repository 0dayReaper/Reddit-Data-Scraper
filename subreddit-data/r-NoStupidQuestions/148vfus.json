So, no you would not be responsible, it\u2019s not your fault but will you be able to get the person to cover the costs? Who knows. It\u2019s like if you get in a car accident and the person who caused it turns out to be an uninsured driver. You\u2019re still going to end up paying to fix your car, even though it wasn\u2019t your fault or you could try to sue, but they may not have any money.",

Understand though, that in the US, you might leave your perfectly capable kid at home and then some nosy neighbor calls Child Welfare and all hell breaks loose. As a parent, I think you can be a pretty good gauge of what your child can and can't handle. And you can always do short trial runs just to make sure everyone can handle it.",

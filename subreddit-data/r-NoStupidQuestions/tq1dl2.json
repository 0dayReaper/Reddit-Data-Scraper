I would\u2019ve been chirping at him for the rest of my time on the stage.\n\nCould have just as easily feigned injury and really fucked up Smiths night too.

If he starts checking his mouth or takes a knee, they have to stop, they probably bring in actual security, he definitely could have tanked the situation to make it seem worse. Will will be a meme for this, but could have been walked out before getting his award and charged... Rock definitely picked a higher road in the moment.",

He accepted a plea bargain in which he admitted \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor\". Right before sentencing, when learning he would most likely face jail time, he fled to France, where to this day, remains a fugitive.\n\nIn 2009, he traveled to Switzerland and was arrested. In response, over 100 Hollywood celebrities signed a letter in protest, these included Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, David Lynch, Natalie Portman, Emma Thomson, Wes Anderson, Harrison Ford, Guillermo del Toro, Alfonso Cuaron, etc.\n\nEven after this arrest, the Academy refused to expel Polansky, only doing so in 2018, after the Harvey Weinstein downfall (another signee).\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman\\_Polanski\\_sexual\\_abuse\\_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski_sexual_abuse_case)",

Emma Thompson originally signed the petition, but later asked for her name to be removed after a conversation with a 19-year-old college student and activist, Caitlin Hayward-Tapp. Other celebrities like Meryl Streep and Whoopi Goldberg did not sign the petition, but spoke out in support of Polanski in other ways. Harvey Weinstein also defended Polanski. However, in 2018, Natalie Portman, Xavier Dolan and Asia Argento expressed regret and apologized for signing the petition.\"",

Rock wasn't anywhere on stage when Smith received his award. Then, of course, Smith gives his impromptu speech when he won the Oscar.\n\nRegardless if the incident was staged or not, it has created a polarity in conversation regarding the Oscars given situations like this has happened before. Anything can happen when airing a live performance.\n\nMost likely what will happen after this fallout is the committee will deem any jokes against any person are no longer allowed, and there will be an increased security to prevent anyone from just walking on stage.\n\nThe Oscars have been a joke for decades, but for some reason, people keep tuning in, like any of it truly matters.\n\nIf this action doesn't turn people off to this ridiculously phony ceremony, this says more about the audience than it does an upset comedian.",

The first issue is one of nomenclature \u2013 there is no legal significant to the term \u201cpress,\u201d or \u201cpressing.\u201d In other words, victims don't decide when charges are filed in a criminal case. When someone was harmed by the conduct of another person, it could be considered criminal conduct if it done with intent to commit an illegal act, or inflict harm on the victim.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It should be noted that every apparent criminal act is prosecuted for a wide range of reasons. In some cases, there is simply a lack of sufficient evidence to convict the alleged perpetrator. The prosecutor has the responsibility to determine whether the available evidence is sufficient to obtain a conviction by the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**They also have an obligation to pursue justice without undue influence from the victim or the community. However, at the same time, they also have a duty protect victims from harm, protect their rights, and hold people accountable for their criminal conduct.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The filing or \"pressing\" charges is one of the first steps in the criminal case process. For many first-time offenders or someone charged with a minor crime, there are some alternative prosecution programs that allow a defendant to earn dismissal of criminal charges.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To give readers a better understanding of who exactly \u201cpresses charges,\u201d our California criminal defense attorneys are providing a review below.",

            "comment": "As people see happening here, if you're rich you aren't accountable for crimes you commit.\n\nDespite my agreement with drawing a line at attacking people's spouses, I draw another firm line at assault. Insults do not warrant assault. \n\nI wouldn't get away with smacking a coworker in the face for the same behavior. Neither would you. But rich people will. \n\nThis is why we won't see Trump held accountable. This is why we won't see politicians in general held accountable. \n\nWe live in a world run by the rich and enforced by their well paid security which, if you've ever actually needed the police, you'll find out that they aren't there to help you at all.",

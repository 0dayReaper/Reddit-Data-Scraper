Perhaps it\u2019s feelings of inadequacy, that\u2019s a pretty common one. Finding self-worth and realizing that she didn\u2019t know you then as she knows you now, and that nothing you did made that situation happen. Not to say that her making her own choices is a bad thing, but it\u2019s not a poor reflection of her to behave how she saw/sees fit just as it\u2019s the same for you. You\u2019re both just 2 people with other lives who have each other now. She\u2019s not your property and you\u2019re not hers. The milage on a person in any sense has no bearing on their worth.",

If you have, how would you expect your girlfriend to react if she learned that you weren't a virgin?  How would you feel if her reaction was negative?\n\nWe all have to have a first time.  Men and women are no different in that regard.  I grew up Catholic, so I can kinda get where you're coming from.  But that's because I grew up in a culture that prized virginity and waiting for marriage before having sex.  We were taught that having sex outside of marriage was like cheating on your future partner.  It was no longer special.  Put more bleakly, you were tainted goods.  And because the religion is still hanging onto double standards when it comes to men and women, women who had sex were considered more tainted than the men.\n\nThat's wrong.  I don't think anyone need to see/hear me say that.  Normally, if someone's having relationship issues related to different values, I'd say judge for yourself if you can live with the issue, get over it, or split amicably before the issue causes it to happen far more messily.  I'm not going to say that this time, however.  I think you need to think long and hard about why this bothers you so much.  Whatever it is, you need to find a way to live with it, or else you need to focus on dating people who share your particular values, if your issue is some belief system.  If you have had sex before, just don't expect them to be any more generous.\n\nOr is the issue that the ex is someone you dislike, and the idea of her being with them just creeps you out?",

So I'll tell her about this new position a friend told me about, or I'll mention that one time where we did that one position which was exciting, or something like that. Just make sure that she is envisioning something, whether it be a memory or a potential situation/fantasy.\n\nI'll also sometimes start kissing her, in her neck, earlobes, stomach, etc. That gets the message delivered pretty well.\n\nJust asking if she wants to have sex also works.",

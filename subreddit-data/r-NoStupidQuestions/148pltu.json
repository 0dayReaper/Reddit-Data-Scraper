I never really cared until now when I\u2019m certain I want to major aerospace engineering in college.\n\nBut I\u2019m worrying that if I\u2019m put into Intermediate Algebra for junior year my brother says I would be a year behind on my math classes, would this mean I won\u2019t be able to take engineering in college? Because I\u2019m behind? \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m taking intermediate algebra as the schedule has not come yet.\n\nThanks, again sorry, I know this isn\u2019t the right place to ask this question",

Whether in high school or in college, you will need to take these courses at some point in order to graduate. Does not truly matter when/where. \n\nSome considerations: \n\nTiming: The typical/recommended 4 years of study curriculum for your degree may presume a certain level of math. If you are behind that, you may need more semesters to graduate. \n\nAdmission: Some schools, once admitted, will allow you to pursue any degree. More selective programs may not allow you to pursue any degree. Selective engineering programs are only likely to select candidates who are excelling in their science and math courses in high school.",

Some maths may be prerequisites for other classes but usually those are later classes. \n\nMy first year were classes like Calc 1, Physics 1, Chem, English, Philosophy (because jesuit university), and CAD with a few other oddball introductory engineering classes mixed in. It wasn't until like Junior and Senior year when the math in the engineering classes actually started using weird calc stuff.",

Meaning they\u2019re people from a lower class that gets to meet these people? Or even the people that have the clean the rooms they have meetings in. What do they do about them?",

They don't do big splashy things that get their faces in the newspapers and on TV.\n\nSo following from that, it doesn't matter if a janitor sees them or whatever, because they just look like people",

            "comment": "Hello /u/dirtbandit101! Thanks for your submission to /r/NoStupidQuestions! However, the automoderator thinks you're asking a question about the current events going on at Reddit regarding the API changes, the Global Blackouts, and why you might not be able to see your favorite subs any more. We like questions! But we've been getting so many questions about this topic that our users get tired of seeing them, so we've removed it. You may have a good question, like:\n\n* Why are so many subs suddenly private? Did it get removed by Reddit? What happens to posts there after the protest?\n\n* Can someone explain this whole Third Party App thing? What is Apollo? Why do some people prefer it to the official app?\n\n* Why isn't my favourite sub joining the protest? Can we force moderators to join?\n\n* Can't Reddit just force subreddits to stay open?\n\n* What are the best Reddit alternatives? Can't someone just copy the Reddit code and make a new version of Reddit that allows third party apps?\n\n* What should I do with my time during the blackout? \n\n[We've created a megathread where you can post questions like these - and more!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/143k833/reddit_api_changes_and_sitewide_protestsblackouts/) Check it out - questions posted there get answered regularly, and your question might already be answered there! If not, **feel free to post questions there** as long as you follow the rules.\n\nThis is an automated message. If you think your question has nothing to do with third party apps or the Reddit blackout, feel free to message the mods. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

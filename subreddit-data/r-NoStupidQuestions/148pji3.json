But anyway, just say \"hey guys, I don't mind driving us all there but I am going to need to fuel back up afterwards. Can you please chip in like $15 (or whatever it sounds right) each for the trip?\". \n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking that. You don't have to explain yourself. Another guy said get the receipt and work out the exact cost everyone owes... No don't do that, it makes you look like a massive tight ass and your friends will resent you for it. It's way too formal and picky. I'd personally happily give a friend $15-$20 for fuel and be done with it rather than get some sort of fucking invoice from them for $12.55. Nobody says a year later \"hey remember when Jim asked us to throw in $15 for that trip?\".. but they will definitely say in a year from now \"Hey remember when that stingy prick sat down and worked out the exact amount everyone owed him?\".",

Another couple hundred pounds on top of 3000 isn't exactly going to cut your mileage down drastically enough to justify splitting the cost of the gas evenly. \n\nBut they should also consider the cost and inconvenience of alternative forms of transportation. \n\nI think if you pay 50% of the gas and split the remaining 50% by however many friends you are taking it would be fair. \n\nIf they give you a hard time just cancel the trip, tell them bluntly you can't afford it and don't offer giving them a ride in the future.",

Everyone I know does it [this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/148pji3/how_much_should_i_charge_my_friends_for_fuel/jo17chw/). \n\nIt's not that deep, just take what you spent as a group and divide it evenly among everyone. Even if you consider the difference in MPG in thinking the friends would be slightly overpaying vs. if they just drove their own car, that's justified by the convenience of having someone else drive.",

Hell if anything the driver should pay *less* than everyone else does, but I always just split it evenly as a courtesy and to simplify things.",

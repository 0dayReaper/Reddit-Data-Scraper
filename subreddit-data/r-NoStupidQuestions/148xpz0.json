    "postText": "I worked as a graphic designer at my old place of work. While I was there I noticed my boss was buying icons from Shutterstock and selling them as logos to our clients. I confronted her on this but she insisted she was doing no wrong.\n\nShe always said: \"There are only a few ways you can draw a [insert logo theme here]\" \n\nWell, things went downhill and to avoid bankruptcy she sold the business to a competitor and all the staff were left without a job. She now works as the creative director for this competitor, and they have kept the name of the business as is.\n\nHere's where I want to ask, WIBTA, if I reported her to Shutterstock? Would I be kicking her while she was down...or would I be redeeming myself with 'you screwed me over, now I'm going to do the same to you'.",

Shutter stock terms of service do not allow stock photos or vectors to be used in full or partial logos unless you purchase an exclusive license. \n\nThis is so the buyer has exclusive rights to the image and there aren't multiple versions of the same logo out there.",

She waited until my contract was due to renew so that she could sell the business without the new owner taking on the staff.\n\nPersonally im not really bothered by that. I didn't want to continue working with her. But it does bother me that she buys logos and sells them as her own. To me that's not what designers do and she took advantage of our clients.",

I would even be tempted to contact the people who had paid for logos and let them know. I despise people who do that shit.\n\nSee what shutterstocks TOS are first. If they don't allow on-selling, then it's open season.",

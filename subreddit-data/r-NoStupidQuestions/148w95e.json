    "postText": "I dated this fool for 4 years. We\u2019ve been broken up for years now but I always wondered\u2026 that condom I found on the side of the bed\u2026 he said he just jerked off into it so less of a mess. He said he did that sometimes. That never sat right with me. \n\nSo is it normal? Do some of you do that? Because that was like less than a year in of dating and I don\u2019t think I EVER saw him do that again. To this day I still think he cheated. It pops up in my head sometimes.",

Finding keys or even tools to bust any locks would be easy.\n\nBoredom and loneliness would probably get to you.  50 years is a long time. 10 would be hard, but maybe doable.",

All I can find is:\n\n&gt; Walmart\u00a0on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against\u00a0Tesla, accusing the company's solar-energy subsidiary of gross negligence after multiple stores experienced fires they say stemmed from solar panels on their roofs.\n\nReading between the lines, it sounds like they might've been under paying (and presumably under training) their installers. So, maybe just simple electrical fires from bad wiring? \n\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-sues-tesla-after-solar-panel-fires-at-stores-2019-8\n\nAlso, in searching that I found out that Amazon is joining the suit. \n https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/amazon-joins-walmart-in-saying-tesla-solar-panels-caught-fire",

            "comment": "Assuming the electricity stays on you'd probably be able to make it for 50 years. You would exhaust your fresh food in under one month, but you could preserve some of it before it goes bad by scouring the store for tupperware containers and ziploc baggies - you could then preserve lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs, etc. After exhausting that food (probably 3 years worth) you would target canned/bottled food. The \"best by\" date for most canned and bottled food is about 2-3 years, and that's only the \"best to sell before\" date rather than the date the food goes bad. So for the next 5-8 years you'd target (no pun intended) all of the canned/bottled food in WalMart, and if you're smart you'd take some of that food and freeze it in the 1000s of Tupperware containers and ziploc baggies still available. This might add another 5 years.  After 19 years you'd start transitioning to the frozen goods still stored in the many freezers....it might taste stale or 'off' but there's no reason to think it would be dangerous. So a conservative estimate, based on a typical Walmart store size, is that you'd last another 5-8 years on frozen food alone which gets you to the 27 year time period. You'd then transition to dry goods like pasta, rice, beans, cereals, etc, which you would hopefully have moved into the freezers in order to stave off dry rot. Cooking all of this food would be made easy by the many microwaves, camp stoves, and even BBQs that you would have found (an indoor BBQ using propane gas cylinders would be reserved for special occasions...the size of the store would mean that vented BBQ gasses indoors would not be a particulalr problem). Assuming you originally enter the store in the spring or summer season, you'd find bags and bags of gardening soil, so you could improvise garden beds (using grow lamps found in the garden section) and extend your beans by growing indoors. \n\nOverall, I'm confident one person could last 50 years in an electrified Walmart. Without electricity I seriously doubt anyone could last longer than 5-10 years.",

We have a full time pest control division to keep the rats and mice out but it's a neverending job, sometimes selectors will be picking cases and stick their hand in a rat/mouse nest. That's just the stuff we catch. The stuff we dont catch makes it to the stores and finds a new home there. Nature always finds a way.",

Treat the fish for disease and take care of them and they would be healthy in no time.\n\nThe biggest issue is size. Most Walmart fish are 1 to 2 inches full grown. Not much meat on the bone\n\nGoldfish would be my go to. Put them in a pond or tub. Something big. Feed them heavily and let them grow. They would be gross but easily sustainable",

No, its more like 5-10% more, if you're lucky. Most of the managers actively work to keep the backroom empty, because corporate decided that will reduce waste. (another story). So my point is there's not as much as you'd expect... we're really stocked for a couple days worth for a neighborhood. So you'd run through the soup, chili, fresh fish and meats in a year (if you ate without rationing), then a year maybe for canned meats and fish, then you'd really be scraping the other isles. If you'd have power you'd get alot of time out of the frozen section. Come to think of it the sugar in all the pop and drinks will power you for quite a while, though it would go bad slowly. I don't think you could live your whole life though. Multiple walmarts, sure.. a la the zombie movies.",

The mice and rats would take care of the rice, beans, noodles, etc. in plastic bags. Canned foods in damaged cans (rust) will go bad. Yes, if you stored a case of canned Pork and Beans in a strictly temperature and humidity-controlled room it would last a long time. Under **normal** conditions, however, canned goods would go bad when the can went bad.\n\nI worked in a cannery. Unless I was starving, I would not eat any canned good over 5 years old.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nSecond edit: I added my first edit after many of these comments, to expand on my opinion.",

Then I'm going to take all the topsoil up there and planting as much food producing plants as i can, except tomatoes. I'm then going to get all the topsy turvies from garden center to plant my tomstoes by running ropes from the previously drilled holes on one end and running those close to arm level. Thst way watrr run off will feed to the ropes and feed the topsy turvy tomatoes...Food, shelter and clothing taken care of. Then start to produce weapons, barricades and booby traps to defend it. Then use some of those weapons to attack surrounding Walmarts in a never ending quest for better resources....",

Then i gotta make a raid on home depot for lot's of sheets of Plexiglas so i can make a semi bulletproof window for each hole. Thus will take some preparations though as the heathens at the HD won't hesitate to use nailguns as their weapon of choice and I'm sure they'll have trip wire triggered pipe bombs protecting their entryways.... This will call for metal reinforced shingaurds, sports cups, catcher pads and helmet with face guard.....

Then use forklifts to dump the bodies out the loading dock and close it down. Raid cleaning supplies for bleach to clean up the blood.  First aid from pharmacy as needed. Erect barricades at any door or weak point. Set up living areas with bedding etc from home furnishings dept.\n\nStart putting perishable items into the freezers and eat only perishable foods until it either runs out or spoils (unclear how long electric lasts). After that make plan for managing dry goods/foods depending on number of survivors. Staff the pharmacy and make plan for survivors who need meds.\n\nOver time, access roof for rain water collection and building garden beds with supplies from garden section. \n\nTry and get a truck into the auto bay and work on outfitting it as a raider.\n\nAnd all along, drink as much of the shitty beer and wine they sell as you can. And find another survivor to bed up with.",

You wouldn't enjoy it, though...\n\nI was thinking that the real limiting factor would be the quantity of durable foodstuffs containing sufficient Vitamin D and Vitamin C to stave off Rickets and Scurvy.  The canned fruit and vegetable aisle is only so big, of course.  But there's a vitamin supplement aisle, too, isn't there?

I assume you can recycle urine, but you also have aisles full of liquid ... must be some way to make sure it doesn't sour ... I assume you would want to open all containers with liquid (soda, juice, etc) and burn off the sugar (which could spoil badly) and get pure water, and then store that as best as possible.  Would be interested to hear other strategies.\n\nEDIT: On the water problem, I think the key is to act immediately while you still have access to electricity (for boiling) and that you should do the following:\n\n* Take all the glass bottles in the store (the question is, are there enough - likely not)\n\n* Take all the non pure water in the store (fruit juice, soda, etc)\n\n* Boil the non pure water and capture the water vapor and store the water in the glass bottles\n\n* Add iodine tablets (from the camping section - but again, are there enough)\n\n* Store pure water in glass bottles in dark storage area out of the way\n\nOthers are saying that you can just rely on all the soda that will be in a walmart.  First, you need approximately 18K 2 liter bottles of soda to survive 50 years.  A regular walmart likely won't have that much (in my assumption, you do not have access to the back storage area).  Second, that soda will spoil due both to the sugar and more importantly the plastic storage.  Others say they would use rainwater.  In my assumption, you have no access to the outside, but if you can access the roof then obviously rainwater is the solution assuming there hasn't been some sort of radiation or similar contaminating event.",

Best option is to boil is and use steam capture to get as much water from it as possible.  That said, most people won't think to do this before it spoils and retention may be minimum.  Consider this largely a loss.\n\n* The fruit juices will also spoil. You'll likely get a year past sell-by-date before mold sets in.  Again, you can try to extend by using the methods described above, but most people won't bother in the first year when you can survive on other liquids.\n\n* Soda and water aisle is a good area to focus on.  But the average person needs 2 liters a day.  That's 365 big bottles of soda a year.  Or 3,650 bottles every 10 years.  Or about 15K-20K bottles of soda and water for 50 years.  Does your Walmart have that number of soda and water bottles on display?  I doubt it.",

            "comment": "**With Power and Water:** Get all the meat and dairy products into the walk-in freezer immediately. That will give you time to start dehydrating all of the meat for later use. There are recipe books with the dehydrators so you know how much salt to use to keep it from spoiling.  Start dehydrating all the produce as well. Use the ovens in the bakery and deli set on low to get all that done. There are plenty of racks and trays to get a ton of it started on day 1. Use vacuum sealers to package everything, then store all that in big plastic totes stored in an area that you surround with insect and rat poison.\n\n**No Power or Water:** Still get all the meat and dairy into the freezer. Take all the produce to the walk-in refrigerator. It'll last longer while you set up some drying racks on the roof. Use volleyball nets and fish nets to keep the birds off your food. Salt it heavily to keep pests off while it's drying. If there are any sunny windows set racks in front of them, too. Dehydrate as much food as you can in the few days you've got. Get some grills going to dehydrate food. Salt as much of the meat as you can to help preserve it.\n\nSet up totes and play pools on the roof to collect rain water. Don't concentrate too much water collection in one area, or it'll cave in the roof.\n\nSet up pools to grow gold fish larger. Might work.\n\nStart farming. Use play pools and tarps to make garden beds filled with soil from the garden section. Read some books on gardening and get seeds started. Start composting your food scraps for eventual fertilizer needs...if you ever run out of the store bought stuff.\n\nIn an apocalyptic situation eventually you'll need to seal up all the toilets and drains with plastic to keep out sewer gas once the water in the traps evaporates.\n\nGet good at catching rats to eat for protein. Those cans of chili aren't going to last forever, bud.\n\nNo matter what, figure out where you're going to dump trash and waste on day 1. Outside away from the building. If you're locked inside, get to the roof, and fling that shit as far as you can. Eventually you'll need to build a trebuchet to get some distance. Might need to keep a rifle handy to pick off the wild animals that will absolutely love your trash heap.\n\nYou've got a shit ton of work to do.\n\nEdit: You can find books on canning next to mason jars. That's another solid way to preserve as much produce and meat as possible with the supplies on hand. Should give you another year of food storage. There may also be info on fermented foods like sourkraut and kimchi. You can ferment lots of foods to preserve them. Also, they may have sausage making kits. If so, you have another good avenue for preserving as much meat as possible. Plus, when the time comes you'll know just what to do with all that rat meat:-)\n\nEdit 2: Speaking of fermentation, you can brew ciders and wines from a lot of the fruit on hand. Get that started too. Everything you need to make a crude pot still to distill alcohol can be found in the cooking equipment and hardware sections...so I've heard.",

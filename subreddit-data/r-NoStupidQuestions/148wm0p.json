It doesn't really make sense to have a second toilet when the other toilet already spends like 98% of it's life span sitting there idle anyway. You would only ever think of the need for a second during those moments where you want to use it and it is already in use. That could make the need for a second toilet seem more practical than it otherwise might be.",

    "postText": "I just watched [this video](https://youtu.be/ZUL94lDyapE) that explained many of the psychoactive compounds in chocolate and their effects. To summarize, there\u2019s caffeine, theobromine (a longer acting, weaker variant of caffeine), phenylethylamine (a stimulant with a similar structure to amphetamine), and anandamide (a cannabinoid which binds to the same receptors as THC). \n\nThe video also explained that the darker the chocolate, the stronger the effects. How strong are the effects, though? Will I get high from eating chocolate?",

It\u2019s why people say they\u2019re addicted to chocolate, but nobody is getting high off of the bean itself. I\u2019d be shocked to learn it\u2019s possible.",

    "postText": "If I have Japanese Knotweed growing in my garden and I didn't want to use herbicides, would salt work? For example if the plants above the ground were cut down by hand and burned, could I kill the rest with salt? You can buy 250kg of de-icing salt for about \u00a390 (10 x 25kg bags). If I covered the area in 250kg salt and allowed it to soak into the ground beneath would that be enough to kill the roots underneath?\n\nObviously this is hypothetical, I know glycophosphate herbicides are the best, but could this work? Or could this even be a helpful method between treatments to try to kill more of the plant or slow growth?",

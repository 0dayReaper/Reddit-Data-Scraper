    "postText": "Early morning is devastating to me, no amount of sleep can fix it, if im awake before the sun has fully risen i will be tired all day even if i had 8 hours of continuous healthy sleep.\n\nWhen i was unemployed i had a \"reverse\" sleep schedule. Up all night, go to bed when the sun is about to rise, wake up around 4pm fresh as a lettuce and full of energy, never felt better in my life.",

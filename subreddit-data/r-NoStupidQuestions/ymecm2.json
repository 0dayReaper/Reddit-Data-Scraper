He put the chip at the end of a Harry Potter wand and ran the leads down the side. He gets on the bus and says something like \"Publicas Transitus!\" and taps the wand which makes a fun sound. People are amazed every time. Another person in my town did the same thing but instead of a wand he had an incision made in his hand and had it installed there. (He's a body mod dude, so this wasn't the weirdest thing he's done.). He just waves his hand and it works, it's also great cuz he kinda looks like Gandalf anyway.",

Inserting sterile metal objects into your body won't provoke an immune response because there's no biological material to respond to.  If the object is not sterile or the wound isn't well cared for, there's a danger of infection.  But if that doesn't happen, all you have to worry about is gradual poisoning from the metals leaching into your body.",

This spec allows small programs to be written for the card and loaded on to the card.  \n\nThe Tesla key applet, when loaded on a card, generates a private encryption key unique to that card and stores it within the card.  When you swipe the card to open or start the car, the car sends a 'challenge' to the card, the card generates a response, then signs the response with its private key.  The car authenticates the response as belonging to an authorized key, and then opens/starts.  \n\nThe Tesla encryption scheme has been reverse engineered and there are open source implementations available.  Note that doesn't allow you to open random Tesla cars, only to make your own keys which you can then authorize for use in your car using an existing key.  \n\nThe companies that make Tesla rings just take a standard NFC JavaCard chip, embed it in a ring with an appropriate antenna, and load the Tesla encryption program onto it.  Thus, voila, a Tesla-opening ring.",

Samsung Pay used the phone's technology to communicate with the magnetic reader that skimmed the cards for their number. People would say \"sorry we don't accept .... \" but if their card reader worked, Samsung Pay worked just as well, except in Walamrt, where Samsung Pay was blocked. The guy who showed me it said he tried to pay at Panda Express and the lady watching canceled the transaction because she thought he hacked the system. This was back around 2015, and this was the state of the US's Pay system, so experiences in other countries at the time were different. Apple Pay may have come before Samsung's, but Samsungs became more widely used because Apple Pay required specific technology whereas Samsung designed theirs to work with existing technology.",

The gist is that you'd need to take the tiny cpu out of your card as well as the antenna, and put them into your wand. Because the antenna needs to cpu to actually transmit anything useful, and because the cpu needs the antenna to receive power and communicate info, both are required.",

    "postText": "My brother died in a work accident. His drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.\n\nAnyway, would it hurt to die that way? \n\nHe was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn\u2019t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. \n\nI wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? \n\nI told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn\u2019t even know what happened, but reading online I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. \n\nI\u2019m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. \n\nEdit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.\n\nI had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.\n\nWith it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn\u2019t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don\u2019t know if I can. \n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the kind words and thoughts and answers. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get this many responses, I honestly just randomly wrote this question trying to help myself with the new grief and pain I was feeling in the moment. \n\nTruly, thank you everyone for taking the time to answer and respond.\n\nMy little brother\u2019s name is Joseph. He was 24 years old, and I think of him every single day. ",

            "comment": "Two things about electricity: it travels at almost the speed of light, and communication from the body to the brain is done with electricity. When he was electrocuted, his brain was overwhelmed by an electrical response from the power line that was much stronger than the body can emit to tell the brain it is feeling pain. Such a high voltage striking a person would disrupt these systems permanently, at least until he died. He was likely brain dead seconds after being electrocuted. Which means he felt no pain despite burning as he would have died from the electricity far before the fire killed him. People aren\u2019t just saying it was instant to make you feel better, it really was. ",

Sometimes being wet can cause the electricity to skirt around the outside of your body where the water is. \n\nIt\u2019s a reason why the electric chair was used as a method of execution for so long. The electric chair sends an initial, powerful pulse of electricity (depending on persons weight)  which causes immediate unconsciousness with just 2,000 volts. The electric chair then provides additional pulses in various locations to cause organ failure.\n\nA 12,000 volt power line is many times more powerful than the electric chair and there was likely so much electricity that it hit every where in the body, guaranteeing immediate contact with the brain. \n\nIf i had to chose a way to die, it would be through lethal injection. My next choice would be electrocution. The only difference for the person dying is with lethal injection you can go out on a high, and electrocution you just go into immediate unconsciousness. ",

Being shot in the head is not like in video games or movies. There are factors that will determine how quickly you die (caliber, location), or even if you die. But so it's clear, this can be an awful way to die. I had a friend shoot himself in the head. His dad found him in the bed about 30 seconds afterwards. His head and brain were severely damaged and he was certainly in shock. But he died after about 2 minutes if drowning in his own blood.\n\nPlease don't do this anyone.",

It's like the difference between trying to stop a train with nothing at all vs trying to stop a train by putting a toothpick on the track. Mathematically it does have an effect, but the train isn't going to notice the difference.",

I can empathize with you as my brother-in-law (who was also a very close friend of mine growing up) died in a similar fashion.\n\nHe was operating the boom of a concrete pump truck and hit low hanging power lines. He probably would\u2019ve been alright as the boom is operated by remote control, but he was leaning against the truck as he was operating the arm. \n\nEven though it\u2019s been almost 5 1/2 years, I think of him often and I\u2019ve had the same question.  This thread has helped to lay some of that to rest. Thank you to all who have contributed. ",

I remember exactly what it felt like and it wasn't painful. It was just...shocking. IDK how else to describe it. Like a very startling, very sudden, sort of buzz-y, numbness.

They communicate electrically but between each nerves there are gaps called synapses which the pain signals have to rather slowly crawl across to reach the next nerve in the line. Then be recived, understood and passed along. It's a very slow process which is why if you touch a hot pan your hand will be yanked away before your brain has realised. It's becuase your body cut some corners to compromise for the slow speed. It just sent the message to your spine instead of waiting for it to get all the way up to the brain and all the way back down for a responce. Your spinal cord takes a while to get the message and respond but it's totally unconsous. I mean try (don't try) grabbing a hot pan and just casually holding on while you mull over if you should let go. It doesn't happen. This shortcut of just asking the spinal cord is a great demonstration of how slow the communication is. \n\nI am sure you have injured yourself and yanked a limb away and then been confused for a half second before you feel the pain. It's SO slow. You wouldn't want your WiFi running at that speed. \n\nOnto the shock in question and I understand if this is a hard read for you. I am sorry this happened to your family. Fuck that company; \n\nNow the level of a shock your talking about doesn't have that delay. Since we are just water bags we are pretty conductive and the electricity from an external source doesn't need to keep stopping and starting it moves at full speed all of the time. The heart will have stopped and possibly other damage will have occurred that was totally incompatible with life before those pain signals could get even to the spinal cord let alone to the brain. You can look into how the human body reacts to pain. I belive there are some slow motion videos on YouTube, now imagine that compared to lightning. That's what is going on here. \n\nNow the body itself (you probably wouldn't want to watch CCTV footage) can appear to have life even when a lethal level of electricity has been applied because our muscles can be manipulated with it, run a currant through some frogs legs and they will dance (usually achieved by putting salt on it). Those frogs are long dead and have absolutely no control or awareness of their dancing legs. Yet they dance because physics also rules biology. \n\nYour brother was almost surely dead not only before he was able to feel the pain but also I would expect before the fire even started. The delay in the fire service being able to get to the site wouldn't have done anything other than help the recovery of any remains. \n\nIt's very likely that he didn't even know or have foresight that death was imminent given how quickly these events unfold. It's faster than a bullet to the back of the head. I would try and take solice in that, not only was he highly unlikely to be in anything that could even resemble the awareness of pain but he probably wasn't even aware that something had gone wrong at all. He was doing his job just another day. You feel the pain and the horror of bereavement but he does not. It's a burdon you must carry with you but you do not need to make it harder on yourself by torturing yourself over if he knew let alone if he had mentally processed any pain. It's your, and your families horror not his and one your mind brings about of its own accord, don't beat yourself up over it but do try and make peace when you are ready. \n\nOh and fuck the company. Really. Fuck them. Monsters. ",

I hate to add a bit of existential dread to your pain, but the human perception of reality pretty much constantly lags behind the actual reality, in that it takes the brain time to receive, process sensory input, then create your perception of \"reality\" and \"now\". \n\nFor example if you touch the tip of your nose with your finger, the sensory information takes much longer to travel from your finger to your brain than it does from the tip of your nose. However, your brain tricks you into thinking that it was instantaneous by equalizing the lag and telling you it was in fact now, in the present, even though it happened slightly in the past.\n\nAnother similar trick is sometimes if you turn to look at a clock with a second hand at first it looks as if the second hand stays motionless for a couple of seconds before it start moving again at a steady rate. That is because the brain didn't see it move and doesn't know that it had moved, but after finally processing the image it sort of goes back into the past and fills in the time it took to piece together the image with what it now knows *ought to* have been there.\n\nIn the case of your brother electricity would have traveled much faster than the sensory information and affected his heart and brain faster than the brain could have processed the information. Because of that he most likely didn't even know what happened. ",

The brain uses electrical impulses and there's a good chance this was too much for it to process and it, for the lack of a better term, shut the brain down because it was too much for it.\n\nThis was likely all completed within the speed of electricity.

We all have a small amount generated in our bodies, it's what allows synapses in our brain, signals from our eyes and skin and tastebuds, and even heartbeats to occur. And if something stops the normal flow of signals, the brain doesn't operate.\n\nIt's the current, the wattage, that determines the deadliness of an electric shock. [In the case of that power line, he'd have received dozens of Amps.](https://wattstoamps.com/12250-watts-to-amps) Death is possible at a fraction of an Amp (70mA, or 0.07A), a whole more likely between 1 and 5 Amps, and as a person approaches 10A it becomes nigh-on certain.\n\n&gt;\"The damage caused by electric shock depends on the current flowing through the body -- 1 mA can be felt; 5 mA is painful.

New York: Glencoe McGraw-Hill, 1995.\n\nHow quick and merciful was it. So fast it struck before he had reaction time to notice. It wiped his mind before he saw anything, before he heard anything, before messages from his body could reach the brain. He was dead the instant the circuit was made between him and the equipment.

No one tell you that, but that is what you can expect. \n\nYou'll be pissed and no one to put it on, you'll be sad and your eyes will leak like faucets and it's just a big confusing mess. \n\nI am here if you need an ear.

The plans you make, vacations, holidays. \n\nIt's such an overwelming feeling and it will be a long time before you feel close to normal, but I promise you, some day you will again. it won't be the same, but it will settle. \n\nIf I had advice to give you I'd suggest you just let it run through the process. And grief takes different forms in different people. Just let it happen, feel what you feel and give yourself permission to feel it. ",

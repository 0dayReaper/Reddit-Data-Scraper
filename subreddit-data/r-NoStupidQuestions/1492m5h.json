If i miss more than 3 days in a 90 day period i get fired and I've already missed two :(",

Well, they paid me unemployment, and if you\u2019ve never had this happen before you will likely get a write up first. I would say, if they don\u2019t care about your health don\u2019t worry about getting fired for being sick. If everyone wasn\u2019t in need of workers right now I might say different, but so many people need good help. It\u2019s up to you, you know the rules, but look up your states laws.",

It stops me from sleeping :(\n\nI have asthma as well so it's a bad combo. can't breath on top of can't breath and since it's half mucus the inhaler isn't helping",

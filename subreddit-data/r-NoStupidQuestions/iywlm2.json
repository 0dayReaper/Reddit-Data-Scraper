Sometimes double ads again.  \n\nEdit: edit since a lot of people are replying with this. I get that content creators put the ads in the middle, but it\u2019s kind of necessary for them. YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue and have made some very strict regulations the last few years on what can and can\u2019t be monetized. Many of the YouTubers I\u2019ve watched for years have mentioned old videos being demonetized and having to avoid certain content.",

Going after a browser extension is a waste of time.\n\n1. Most ads need to call home in order to, at minimum, verify that the advertisers are getting their money's worth. Otherwise I could claim any number of people clicked the ad. \n\n2. By being a separate resource loaded on to the page, CDNs can work their magic. This also means that the ads can be dynamically spliced into the video content.\n\nThose exact same reasons are what allow ad blockers to function like they do. All ad blockers really do is block specific domains and don't allow ads to load.\n\nThe only way to make truly unblockable ads is to bake it into the video. It means a tremendous amount of resources would need to be used in order to render the content and cycle different ads. They aren't going to do this, it would kill their servers and make number of clicks unverifiable by a third party.",

The long and short of it is: if you agree to see ads, you get paid 70% of whatever the advertiser paid! Then you can give some of your earnings back to creators you like. And if you don't agree to see ads, you don't see ads.\n\nLots of big-name creators / publishers are already signed up: [givebat.org](https://givebat.org) (full disclosure, that's my site), [batgrowth.com](https://batgrowth.com), [https://www.bat.watch/](https://www.bat.watch/)\n\nIf you're interested in the browser, [here's a link](https://brave.com/giv892) (referral link, will help support [givebat.org](https://givebat.org)), or here's a non-referral link if that's not your thing: [https://brave.com/](https://brave.com/)",

Even big name youtubers like Pewdiepie have this, youtube is his job so when his videos are barely 10 minutes long, it's when you know that he's just doing his job",

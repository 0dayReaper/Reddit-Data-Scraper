    "postText": "I don't know where I can really go for advice on this. My brother is 13 and can't read, like at all. When I to try and find resources for help I don't find much. Could anyone point me in the right direction to help? \n\nFor context we're in Texas, and my parents \"unschool\" my siblings. Talking with them is impossible on this subject, and they refuse to send my brother to school. They are currently putting him through a program called \"Brain Balance\", and as far as I can research BrainBalance is a scam and doesn't have any evidence to support their claims. \n\nIf nothing else if anyone knows who or where I can reach out for help that would be fantstic!",

            "comment": "I know a lot of folks are talking about CPS, but I wanted to throw in some advice on reading. I was an elementary reading teacher for many years. I also worked with older elementary kids who struggled with reading. The thing that got the fastest and most effective results for the kids I worked with was finding something they were really interested in and reading with them about it. For example, I had one kid who was a die-hard Trekkie. I bought him several books that went into the Star Trek lore and schematics of the ships and space stations. He would sit and pour over those for the hours with me and his parents told me he kept reading at home. I would help by reading aloud with him, sliding my finger under the words as I read - never telling him it was for his benefit. I let him think that's just how I read. Over the course of a few months, his reading improved significantly. I'm not going to tell you he was ready to read War and Peace, but he was able to get through basic texts with minimal assistance.\n\nYou're in a really tough spot and I applaud you for recognizing how important reading is and wanting to help your brother. Find something he loves, find a text on it (book, magazine, printed webpage - whatever) and tell him you want to show him something cool and just start reading, pointing as you go. Maybe find things regularly and do this. It can be five minutes or as long as you can keep him focused.  This absolutely won't solve everything, but it will help to bring him to a basic level of literacy and it might help him to become interested in reading.\n\nGood luck and let us know how things go!\n\n\nEdit:\nThanks for all the kind words, additional great ideas, and awards! What a great community!! I'm a Texan too and really appreciated all the Hank the Cowdog comments! \n\nAlso, I was today years old when I learned it was, \"pore\", not, \"pour\"!",

As a late reader myself (but due to disability), one of the most meaningful things for me was going hang out at the library or bookstore. It was big and quiet so I could slip away easily and look for things that were easy to work through (for a good sense of accomplishment) or for a challenge (without having to be watched as I struggle). It was really great because it let me work at my own pace without feeling self conscious. Perhaps this could be a fun activity with your brother once he has some basic skills down?",

Star Trek painted a picture to what I wanted to be out there, and how in the future, we could possibly see it for ourselves.\n\nIn my opinion, I always felt that Star Trek was a show for people who felt like they didn't fit in. Personally, I'm highly functioning autistic, and characters like Seven of Nine and Data were characters I resonated with. Someone who tries to understand humans, and tries to understand the concept of emotion, and is puzzled. A piece that looks right, but doesn't quite fit.\n\nFor me, it's the same way. I couldn't really have a good conversation with anyone my age. I couldn't  really understand that some students weren't always being nice. I didn't realize that sometimes they were making fun of me. So, whenever I did realize I was being made fun of; whenever I felt like I couldn't fit in, I would put on Star Trek. \n\nA future filled with optimism and acceptance. No discrimination. No one is treating anyone different. Everyone is equal, and working towards one goal: seeking out new life, and new civilizations. Boldly going where no one has gone before.",

We would go on semi frequent trips to the \"big city\" in shit-splat Montana and walk around the mall, go to Costco, etc.\nShe wouldn't buy us a damn thing on those trips\u2013 until we got to Barnes and Noble... If it was printed word of any kind she'd buy it. I found Kurt Vonnegut that way. Still own and enjoy the big prints of Calvin &amp; Hobbes too! Reading never tickled me in my youth the way it did my folks, but after READING this post and these comments I have never been so grateful of their dedication. Keep those kids reading!",

It\u2019s not going so great right now but I\u2019ll keep trying, in part because of my own grandmother who has since passed would want me to help them discover the wonders of knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake. \n\nAgain, you don\u2019t know me from Adam, but I don\u2019t think you screwed up, really.

My home state has a public residential high school that's free to attend and has incredibly strong academics. I was absolutely desperate to attend when I learned about it. I got to move out at 16 and live with a bunch of smart and interesting people.\n\nFunny enough, my educational path led me to being a cancer researcher, which is what eventually killed my mother. It's kinda poetic, I guess, that using education to run away from her led me to a career involving her lived experience.",

The actual outcomes pretty much mirror other methods of schooling -- if you've got parents with time and money, you'll do well, if not, good luck. \n\nIn my very unprofessional opinion, the real problem is that a lot of the parents who believe in 'radical unschooling' (there are different forms of unschooling) tend to be fundamentalist Christians who don't agree with learning things like evolution and/or conspiracy minded antivax types who think Bill Gates runs the US public education system.",

Do kids get the chance to take actual classes on things? Nobody really stumbles across calculus on their own. How do they get access to quality learning materials, and how can they ever get a job or go to university with no formal schooling? Do they just study for diplomas/SATs/Alevels/what have you on their own? I can see how, with dedication, it could work on the level of the child's ability, but how on earth are they integrated into the rest of the system later? I'm sorry, this is not a thing we do where I'm from.",

They had a pretest at the first class, and I did well enough that the teacher advised my parents that I probably didn't need the classes. So I took the test and passed first try, and that was all the documentation I needed for college. I started out at a community college, so I didn't have to worry about SATs. Got my associates with a good GPA, applied to the local state university, got in without any trouble.\n\nThat said, unschooling did have disadvantages. The most annoying one was that I was very good with logic, but I didn't have any formal learning for math, so when I took the test to see what math class I should start with in college, I managed to work out the problems and get the right answers using my own methods. Which sounds neat, until I attended the first College Algebra class and didn't understand a damn thing in the intro of the textbook because I never learned how to do it like everyone else. So I moved to intermediate algebra. They were still doing review before starting on new stuff. I'd never heard of y \n= mx + b, so I was completely lost there, too. Had to go down one more level before I found where I needed to be.\n\nIn short, I learned how to do things in my own way in math, which probably helped me to understand *concepts* more easily, but taught me absolutely none of the basic formulas or terminology.\n\nI also wonder if I could have gotten diagnosed with autism sooner if there had been a teacher to compare me behavior to that of the hundreds of kids she's seen, instead of it happening when I was 26 because I switched doctors for insurance reasons, and the new ones had to do a full assessment with my transferred medical records. Apparently my previous psychiatrist *suspected* asperger's (back when that was still a diagnosis), but he never actually diagnosed me with it for some reason.",

If you send a kid from a poor socio-economic backgrounds to public school, or Waldorf, or Montessori school, or unschool them, chances are they will grow up to have the same socio-economic status as their parents.  And same with a kid from a good socio-economic background; they are gonna grow up to be the same as their parents.  Unfortunately, the method has little to do with the outcome.  If we did find a good method: then everyone would send their kid to that kind of school!\n\nMy particular area of study was kids and screentime.  All the magazine articles and blog posts that say screentime causes ADHD, poor grades, addiction etc are bullshit: they are confusing correlation and causation. When you look at the actual studies, The fact is poor kids get a lot of screentime and rich kids don't.  Once you separate out those variables, there isn't a lot of difference (with a *possible* weak causation of obesity and eye problems -- but even that is not for sure). \n\nAgain, I am not an expert on unschooling. I would be particularly interested in seeing if methods like unschooling *exaggerate* socio-economic backgrounds (ex. Poor kids do worse than in public schools and rich kids do better than in public schools) because that is my suspicion but I've never seen the data to back it up.",

They made us their priority, and made every effort to choose family time together over more work, even as their debt soared. We could not take family vacations, but we could take walks around the neighborhood every night. We could not do after-school activities, but we could read and sing and talk together. We could not get tutoring or test prep services, but we could sit down together with our homework and try to figure it out.\n\nMy sister and I both ended up doing great in school, getting university scholarships, and getting good jobs.

We don\u2019t remember the poverty; we remember the time together as a family.\n\nNot everyone can spare the time and energy to be there for their kids, least of all the poor.

We made sure our kids learned and even had them take some standardized tests to see how they were doing (I think it was the Iowa state test?) so we would know what to focus on. They turned out pretty good - one completed her bachelors degree and got a programming job for a large Texas company. The other is still working his way through college.",

One of them was super smart and bored so by the time they were done with 8th grade (in public school) I didn\u2019t see the point of subjecting them to four additional years of boredom in HS. I did give them the option because I know the social aspects of HS are important to a lot of teens, plus while I could provide opportunities for plenty of electives, some things I just didn\u2019t have the ability to offer (like specific team sports). But my kid wanted to homeschool and finished in about half the time it normally takes. Got a 31 on the ACT and is in college looking at infosec or programming as career options.\n\nMy current high schooler is a delightful child but isn\u2019t on the same level as the other. They will probably need the full four years to finish, which is absolutely fine. My reason for homeschooling them is the high school they were going to (started 9th grade this year) dumped an obscene workload on the students. My kid started class at 7:30 am and school ended at 2:45. Then would have homework and wouldn\u2019t be done till 9 or 10 pm. I mean, they weren\u2019t slacking off either- I was helping with the homework and the teachers were ALL dumping project level work on the students every week. It was insane. I took honors and AP in high school and never had that level of work. Hell, in COLLEGE full time it was never that bad!\n\nMy poor kid was just starting to loathe and dread school in general and swearing up and down they\u2019d never go to college and subject themselves to four more years of this hell. So I withdrew them and we\u2019re homeschooling. It\u2019s so so much better now. We start at 9 instead of 7:30 and when we\u2019re done (usually by 2pm) that\u2019s it! Plus we had a conversation about how college isn\u2019t like high school at all and they\u2019re more open to the idea now.\n\nMy youngest is still in public school but I\u2019m obviously willing to homeschool if I think it will provide a better educational experience. We reevaluate all the time to make sure everything is still going as it should!",

I am the teacher the rest of the week. The curriculum is pretty good, and there's lots of reporting. Online tests - and yeah, I guess you could cheat because they don't proctor them til 3rd grade - but at this age the point is to learn, not get scores. Also tracking of hours spent online, scores for online math and phonics games, online book reading etc.\n\nBut I spend 10 hours a day trying to get her to do 4 hours a day of work and listening to infinite whining.\n\nI imagine a lot of parents tried and eventually gave up, but didn't have an easy option to get their kids back in school (with in person schooling not available.)\n\nShe's doing fine, improving a lot, but I am so burnt out, absolutely ready for these last 6 weeks to be over. And as a native English speaker, I never realized how fucking weird English is to read. \"ea\" says \"E\" except when it says \"eh.\" \"Ow\" can sound like bow, or like cow, \"oo\" can be like book, or like moon. \"CH\" says chhh except when it says k (like in ache).  \"ie\" doesn't follow the first vowel says its name rule (piece.) The suffix -ed says ed except when it says \"d\" and \"t\" (like asked). Don't get me started on schwas (like above - uh buv). Who decided -tion says \"shun\"? I'm not qualified to teach this shit.\n\nThis is a public online charter school, so not the same as homeschool where the parent determines the curriculum. But in both the parent has to be the teacher.",

I have a problem with unschooling/homeschooling when it is done out of laziness *or* to prevent the child from learning or developing certain things. I do like the Montessori approach to early education but that at least has some semblance of structure.",

I've worked with 3 year olds who show a spark for writing and, when guided by a skilled educator, can read and write at a much higher level than expected for their age (let's not get into paradigms of development here). Part of my job is noticing children who might be more interested in building train tracks than learning to read and write, and finding a way to bring the two together. Rather than *forcing* someone to learn, make it meaningful and relevant. This leads to deeper learning and, more importantly, happier experiences!\n\nI guess the problem is most people who home school don't have a degree and years of experience in education. I'm the first to criticise the education system but even with my qualifications I would hesitate to home/unschool.\n\n(edit: said education too many times in a row, sounded clunky)",

When I was a kid we had a caseworker at one point and it was no big deal, he just stopped in a couple times to make sure no one was harming us and it was all over after a few weeks. \n\nAs an adult, I had a mandatory reporter contact CPS because I had lost my home post-divorce and was living out of my car with my toddler. It was the scariest experience of my life, until I actually met the caseworker and she was super nice. She asked what my plan was and gave me advice on options I had. I moved into a new house with my son a couple weeks later and never saw her again. As a parent, it was a real splash of cold water in my face and really motivated me to take action and get my bearings as quickly as possible, and I'm actually grateful to have had the experience.\n\nOnly speaking anecdotally, unless your parents are actively abusing their children then it's highly unlikely that any serious action will be taken. Most likely, your parents will be spooked into getting your brother the support he needs.",

Parents have the right not to send children to school or school them how they see fit. If the child is being abused or neglected we can do something and regardless of how I feel about a 13 year old being illiterate the only question about school I am allowed to ask on the subject is 'are you in school?'. Now if OP is in Lubbock they play by their own rules and will force parents to put children in school. We aren't allowed to though. Lubbock is its own special hell.",

We're all critical of other stages of service more often than not. My unit is for the most part pretty close so there isn't a lot of toxicity with the unit. \n\nLubbock isn't like that though. The units up there don't give too much of a shit about each other and they really don't care about their clients or the policies in place. CPS workers Lubbock are extremely religious and if you don't fit that mold they are hostile. Many of our clients do not fit that mold. I'm not saying all of the workers up there are bad but from my experience with them they do their best to get out of doing as much work as possible and are even pretty hostile to other workers. \n\nThere's an investigator in our unit from Lubbock who's a special person and does some things that shouldn't be done. She does them because it's what she got away with in Lubbock. She's also the largest source of drama in the unit so we all avoid her as much as possible. She was my mentor when I started and I almost quit several times. I definitely said some things to her I'm not proud of when she'd throw me under the bus for her mistakes.",

Where I live, parents are legally obligated to have their children formally educated until they\u2019re 16. No exceptions. There are options for home schooling, but it is formalized (i.e. you have to register that you\u2019re home schooling, and someone tracks your kids progress with respect to the standardized curriculum).",

I waited for six hours until a case worker saw me and I just burst into tears. She helped me get food stamps and cash assistance, literally within 48 hours I had the money and I could get my brain out of survival mode and onto solving my housing woes. She's the one who had to report me, but she warned me and told me it was just for my son's benefit and she could tell he was well-cared for. She was the real savior. Within six months I was off welfare and had a home and a stable life once again. It was five years ago and just a surreal memory now.",

I raised a toddler (now in elementary school) with my partner, and for some reason I've had these terror-fantasy-hallucinations regularly: just get nearly overwhelmed by thoughts exactly like that: *what if I had to raise my kid without my current job and house? What if we lived out of the car?* It's terrifying. I don't know what I'm trying to say except that your situation was a bad thing, but the fact that it's over and you were able to get a house to raise your kid in is wonderful.\n\n*Edit*: If anyone thinks I had an experience like this, no, I didn't. I've had a very easy time of parenthood, not least because of my partner, but I have also been fortunate to have a good job and (since my mid-30s anyway) no serious concerns about paying the bills (knock on wood). Just saying this experience was kind of my nightmare. Still is. /u/maebeTrash lived one of my nightmares and survived, and kept their kid safe, which is heroic. I know there are so many people who don't get the resources to make that happen, and it's not their fault; but it's still heroic when it happens.",

So removal really is (and should be) the last resort and after attempting multiple supports.\n\nI don't know how the education system works in Texas, but where I live if you are home-schooling your child needs to meet a certain standard or it becomes illegal for you to continue to home-school (unless the child is of an age where education isn't compulsory). Likewise the onus for getting your brother back up to speed would fall on the education department and not CPS. \n\nMy advice would be to contact the Texas Education Agency: \n\n\"According to the Leeper case, the only legal requirements to homeschool in Texas are\n\n*  The instruction must be bona fide (i.e., not a sham).\n*     The curriculum must be in visual form (e.g., books, workbooks, video monitor).\n* The curriculum must include the five basic subjects of reading, spelling, grammar, mathematics and good citizenship\". \n\nFrom what OP is describing at least two of these are potentially not being met.",

It's one of the things that sucks working in the sector, people assume that anything child welfare related falls on CPS, when there's often quite clear distinctions according to legislation, so CPS will close after informing Education Dept., education fail to act and the people who notified hate CPS for it. \n\nOP I did some digging and found this:\n\n&gt;[Texas](https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/advocacy/kids/how-to-report-state-by-state/#texas)\nSuspicions that a homeschooling family is not providing the education required by law should be reported to the child\u2019s local school district.\nConcerns that include abuse or neglect (other than failure to educate) may be reported to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services at 1-800-252-5400.\n\n&gt;Because Texas is a universal mandatory reporting state, every person who has \u201ccause to believe that a child\u2019s physical or mental health or welfare has been adversely affected by abuse or neglect\u201d is required by law to report it. See family code \u00a7 261.101. For more information, see Mandatory Reporters of Child Abuse and Neglect.\nTexas homeschools operate as private schools. Apart from subject requirements, there are no legal requirements. If you suspect a family of failing to follow the subject requirements, you should report them to their local school district. Larger districts may have a designated truancy officer, while in smaller districts you may need to ask for the person who handles compulsory attendance and truancy issues. This person would have the authority to investigate violations of the homeschooling statute and bring charges if necessary.\n\n&gt;Failure to educate is not included in the state\u2019s definition of neglect, meaning that Texas\u2019 Department of Family and Protective Services does not intervene in homeschool settings unless abuse or other forms of neglect are also involved.\n\n&gt;For more on homeschooling in Texas, see our state brief.",

That is what I came here to address. I have a learning disability too and it wasn\u2019t diagnosed until *college*. OP, if your brother has health insurance, I\u2019d recommend you take him to the doctor for an evaluation. My children went through those (it\u2019s a four hour appointment where they test language, math, response times, puzzle-solving, etc)... Both of my kids have ADHD and 1 is autistic. Even though your brother isn\u2019t in public school, knowing about any learning disabilities or difficulties can help him to access resources as he grows, and things like dyslexia can impact things other than reading! Also-You said he loves audiobooks, and he uses text to speech programs \u2014 that\u2019s actually really great to hear! If he has a learning disability, his familiarity with these tools is going to help him a lot as he gets older. And if he *doesn\u2019t* have a disability, you can use these things as motivation to help him want to learn to read. There are loads of books that aren\u2019t available as audiobooks; you could try first bringing this up with him, &amp; asking if he\u2019s come across any that interest him... if he has, buy the book for him &amp; then read it with him, combined with some practise of phonics. (This is how I practise Spanish: I buy books in Spanish and them read them aloud to myself. I keep a dictionary near myself while I read, to look up what I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s slow going, but it makes the language stick, and keeps me interested.)  -Also, I don\u2019t know if you have Dollar Generals (chain store) there in Texas, but here in Iowa, they offer adult literacy programs for the community. A couple of people also suggested the public library\u2014these are also a good resource! Lastly, OP, thank you for wanting to help your brother. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re not on speaking terms with your parents but it\u2019s obvious you love your brother very much, and that\u2019s so good to see. I hope that my reply helps you - both of you guys.",

Motivation will be huge, and if he's motivated, his skills will grow much faster than if he sees reading as a burden.\n\nSecond, get him started memorizing sight words (super common words that are typically taught through memorization as opposed to phonics). The Dolch Sight Word lists are commonly used and easily Googled. \n\nThird, as he's building automaticity with sight words, look up \"high-interest, low-readability\" materials. Since teen and adult readers are typically turned off by reading books for children, these books are more accessible and feature more grown-up situations (while still being appropriately leveled for developing readers). \n\nFinally, consider reaching out to any local colleges (especially those that feature teacher preparation programs). Universities often feature low or no-cost tutoring programs, and even if this isn't something your parents would permit, you might be able to get in touch with someone to offer you even more targeted advice or access to materials. \n\nBest of luck.

I'm not sure what a good course of action is, but I would try to get information from a counselor or a family member who might be open to help.\n\nGood luck, and I hope you'll find the help you need",

Also, there is an easy to use book called \u201cTeach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.\u201d You can also get Orton-Gillingham structured literacy programs at the library to use. Another idea is paired reading. Get a simple book and read it along with him. If there are no learning disabilities he should pick up on it pretty fast. There\u2019s also apps like Reading Eggs. You could spend 20 mins a day with him to help him a lot. I wouldn\u2019t involve CPS. Are there some grandparents you can speak to? Or if your brother is motivated, you can just teach him yourself?",

[Here ](https://www.readingrockets.org/reading-topics/phonological-and-phonemic-awareness) is an article describing that. I would suggest looking up videos like [this](https://youtu.be/CYi_gDyrHLU) Heggerty is an amazing program for this and has helped many students to learn to read.\n\n[Here ](https://www.readingrockets.org/article/decodable-text-sources) are some books known as decodable readers. They hone in on specific skills to look at and master those skills. \n\nMost importantly, he needs to be patient.

            "comment": "Years ago I worked as an aide in a high school in California that got students from lower schools that allowed kids to \u201clearn what they wanted to learn\u201d at their own pace, and would forward them on to the next grade regardless of what they had learned. It was the 1970s, when such ideas were not that unusual. Among my \u201clearning disabled\u201d (really just neglected) students was a senior who literally could not read at all. I taught him to recognize danger signs like \u201cpoison\u201d etc. I asked him what his plans were after high school and he said he was going on welfare, like his parents. Another student could read just a little, and I created a one-on-one class to teach her with movies and very simple books. The \u201cfinal exam\u201d I gave her was to write her own name and address. Out of the whole high school population fewer than a dozen went on to college. I hope things changed after I left. Side note: This was the high school where some of the Green Day musicians went to school a few years later, in Crockett. \n\nAs for how to help the brother, I wonder if OP can try to teach him. It can be so rewarding to help someone overcome illiteracy, and there should be lots of things online to help them get going. Get some simple books from the library\u2014they should have simple books for older students. I just googled for simple readers for older students and came up with a lot of them.",

            "comment": "Some Ancient Egyptians were depicted as black in Egyptian drawings, and since Egypt interacted with people far to the south, it's likely that there were some blacks in Egypt. There were even black Nubian kings who ruled as Egypt's 25th dynasty (747\u2013656 BC). But DNA analysis of more ancient mummies indicate they are genetically similar to people in the Middle East, and not people in sub-Saharan Africa.",

There was a sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry from 6 to 15% within\ntheir genetic construction. The DNA is of the modern Egyptians is quite diverse as it carries traces from southwest Asia and the\nPersian Gulf at 17%, Jewish Diaspora at 4%, eastern Africa at 3% and Asia Minor at 3%. Much greater levels of sub-Saharan\nAfrican ancestry are located in current-day populations of southern as opposed to northern Egypt.\"\n\nSource: https://www.egypttoursportal.com/en-us/race-of-ancient-egyptians/",

The Nubians from modern day Sudan had a big presence in Egypt and they looked \"black\". Also between Greece and Rome, Egypt was controlled by Europeans for some 800 years. It was actually pretty diverse depending on the time period.",

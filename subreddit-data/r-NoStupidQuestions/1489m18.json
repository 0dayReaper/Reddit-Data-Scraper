    "postText": "So recently my friend and his girlfriend came round to visit with a few other friends. During that time we were taking about conspiracies, as they're both heavily into so many different conspiracies, when his girlfriend said that covid was only just a cold and people only died from it because they were told it would kill them so it did. Essentially they died because of the placebo effect. I laughed so hard it hurt my head, maybe that was rude of me and you can tell me if I'm being ignorant/naive but that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. It absolutely rips on all the front line workers at hospitals looking after people that were genuinely ill and not just dying because they believed it would kill them. \n\nSince then I've said to my girlfriend that I don't want this woman to come round anymore because I don't want to surround myself with people like that. I'm almost 30, we're not young kids being silly and thinking up conspiracies these are genuine adults believing this. My gifrirend told me that I'm being silly and I should accept that woman's opinion otherwise it's rude, especially if I say how ridiculous it is to her face. \n\nNow my friend is asking about meeting up some more and I'm just being vague about agreeing to it or not. Maybe I just need to sort of figure out how to discuss it them but then I just don't think it's unreasonable to not want people in my life that think like that. What do you think?",

They were partially correct (in that it was clearly a govermment power grab and a wealth transfer, and those in power enforcing the lockdowns were not scared of Covid themselves and continuously broke their own rules.\n\nCovid is real. It doesnt kill as many people as they led us to believe in the midst of it. Chris Wittys initial speech was that it is a very mild virus, and likely only the very old and immumocompromised would ever be at risk. This was proven to be true. \n\nIm sorry for your friend. Ive been effected by covid too. But you cannot blank people out of your life who have a different opinion than you. Otherwise you stand the risk of being in an echo chamber of your own opinions without ever questioning any belief you have.",

Idk if you knew her before her boyfriend or were introduced to her as \"his girlfriend\" but if it's the latter and they are otherwise considerate, or just generally good people then I feel it's a little overkill.\nImo you have 3 options in varying intensity:\n\n1) Don't stop being friends and just don't talk about the topic if you can't be bothered hearing their opinions.\n\nThis, as i mentioned, depends on how close you are with them otherwise, whether they are overall decent company but have this large downside and whether they inject it into every conversation (nothing is logical or simply happens, everything is under \"their\" control and out of malice) or not.\n\n2) Don't stop being friends but every time the topic comes up you take a stance. Not in a debate-bro kind of way but, as another commenter has pointed out, in ways that show your thoughts on it (it's illogical, ask pressing questions why they believe X over Y).\n\nThis is just a variant of option 1) just a little more combative, takes more effort but might solve the problem as well. Either they might question themselves and their beliefs (slightly naive of me to say, yes), they accept your different opinion and you don't go down their rabbitholes because of your own strong stance\n\n\n3) cut them off\n\nIf you can't be bothered or if they aren't worthwile, then that's definitely an option. You can freely decide who you are friends with but in recent years I see many people online that have turned to single-issue unfrienders. I have friends that I don't agree with (some are pretty into esoteric stuff about energies for example) but they don't enforce that upon me all the time. We have conversations where we sometimes try to understand each other's ideas more but besides those it barely gets brought up. Eventhough we have fundamentally different beliefs, it still works because I am friends with the person, not with the belief, and they don't make their beliefs their personality. But I also understand that we have to draw a line somewhere and depending on the person we might draw it differently. I couldn't even tell you how I would approach a person as you described, whether knowing that they believe that is enough for me to lose all interest. If that's said by a peer I might reconsider meeting them ever again, if it's my grandma I won't stop visiting her just for that - I think you get the point.\n\nI'm just saying, think about the situation and the person, whether it actually is that big of a deal in the grand scheme of the 4 of you. Also think about your lines in the sand and whether this is one of them or whether your gut reaction to cut her off right away is in itself, while valid, possibly misguided by something else.\n\nThat's my 2,5 cents (inflation and that). Make conscious decisions - people and by extension relationships are complicated.\n\n\nEdit: added small inflation meme",

The bigger issue is are you just going to avoid hanging out with the two of them or just say \"nah don't bring your girlfriend\" because that is quite rude.",

And more so the kinds of people that tend to follow these conspiracy theories tend to be self important, narcissistic, anxious, and impulsive.   \n  \nMore importantly, scientific theories by definition must be falsifiable. That is they must make reliable predictions about the world, and if those predictions turn out to be incorrect, the theory can be declared as false. Conspiracy theories, on the other hand can be tough to disprove. their proponents can make the theories increasingly elaborate, to accommodate new observations and ultimately any information contradicting a conspiracy theory can be answered with \"well sure, that's what they want you to think\".  \n  \nSo you just have to ask yourself, is that the kind of person you want in your life? someone that's not grounded in reality, or the scientific process. If they can justify conspiracy theories about Covid, imagine what will happen when they start having conspiracies about you and your behavior.",

Friends from school off and on, he was always a bit of a dick but that was just him. I think he was slightly on the spectrum.\n\nAfter knowing each other for decades he came to me and said he was depressed and didn't know what to do. He was a Christian and suffering from depression. His wife didn't understand and he felt Jesus had abandoned him.\n\nAs an Atheist I told him how he shouldn't look for help from Jesus because it wouldn't be forthcoming, but to look for it from his family, friends, members of his Church, and most importantly, therapy and.to consider medal remedies.\n\nWe talked every night for six months. My son was three at the time, but we spoke for many hours into the night.\n\nHe finally took my advice. Saw a doctor, was prescribed antidepressants, and guess what? He started feeling better. Brilliant.\n\nThe next day he told me he was so happy he had found Jesus again. He'd been through the wilderness and had come out the other side. I asked him wtf he was talking about, Jesus hadn't been there for him but I had.\n\n\"I realised that Jesus put you on the path to speak to me, so I can save you\"\n\nAnd at that point I realised that it's OK to cut people out of your life.\n\nDon't get me.wrong, I'm glad he's fine and happy now, and I'm glad I helped, but I'm also glad to not have him in my life any more.",

Do you want to continue?\n\n(again, calmly)\n\nFrom this point forward, I've had it go three ways\n\n1. The person changes the subject, and we never address it again.\n2.

I enjoy debate and discussion, but it needs to be based around facts and figures. So if a person is too firmly entrenched in their beliefs (to the point it is ideology) it may not make them comfortable to be around me. On the other hand, sometimes we can agree to be civil, and leave it at that.\n\nThe best example of \"staying civil\" are my in-laws who are **very** religious. I am respectful of their beliefs, I bow my head quietly while prayers are being said, but I am an educated non-believer ... and they know that. Generally, they will not attempt to preach at me; and I will not argue with them. Its cool for them to discuss their beliefs because it forms a major part of their day-to-day living (he is a pastor after all ... stuff happening at the church is what he's got to talk about). At the same time, they do not cite biblical passages at me ... it happened once ... I looked him in the eyes confidently, ready to debate that passage, he dropped it.\n\nWe keep it civil for the kids, and I like hanging out and gardening with them.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* if you can find alternate common ground great\n* if you can't, so be it",

It went from about $50 a month to almost $450 a month because it switched to a \"silver\" plan or whatever.\n\nCan they just... Do that? I'm out a few thousand dollars? I have to cancel my insurance? Is there nothing I can do?",

            "comment": "What kind of insurance?  (health?  Auto?)\n\nWhat provider?  (company provided?  policy through an insurance agent?)\n\nThe basic answer is that your policy and your premium can actually change at any time for any reason no matter who is providing the policy.  Insurance companies drop policies or change the policies that they offer.  They will sometimes move their clients to a new policy that they believe to be \"similar\" to what was offered before. \n\n**The bigger issue is that when this happens, you should have been notified that the policy you previously had was no longer being offered.  You should have had the chance to pick a different policy or decline this policy.**\n\nIf this is something provided by your employer, the same basic things apply.  Your employer can change company provided insurance and enrollment in the program often carries over if you don't do anything to change your options.  If you had an insurance plan with your employer, and changes happened to the policy, if you did nothing during \"open enrollment\" to change your options, your plan moved to the \"closest\" option being offered in the next group of choices.\n\nI have been in this situation several times.  Insurance policies have been dropped, changed, or premiums raised.  I was always notified about 30 days ahead of the change and had time to make the correct arrangements to actually pick the policy I wanted if I didn't want to accept those changes.  \n\nThere is some chance that the information that should have notified you of these changes was lost in the mail.  You will need to contact your insurance provider and find out your options for a more affordable policy.  If this is a company provided benefit, that might be subject to open enrollment rules and could be harder to change.\n\nGood luck.",

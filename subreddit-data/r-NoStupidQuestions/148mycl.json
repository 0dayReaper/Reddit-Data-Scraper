Disclaimer the second book is also a fusion of modern psychological schools and Eastern and occult philosophy so that might not be up your alley. \n\nThe great thing? You don't have to believe any of it to just enjoy the read and learn something about yourself.",

One of the gold standards for social skills and not religious afaik. \"Surrounded by idiots\" is a good one for dealing with different types of people. \"The power of habit\" is one I have heard is good for developing healthy routines. How to Be an Anti-Racist is pretty great for developing social conciousness.",

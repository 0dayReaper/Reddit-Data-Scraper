    "postText": "Hello yall long story short I was rear ended then a week later I hit a deer, got the estimate from my insurance company and sent it to the repair shop of my choice. I did not sign anything just gave them both estimates, my car inst drivable so the insurance covered a rental. Well the shop cant get it in to fix till August and the insurance company said thats not going to work so they switched repair shop now the original one is yelling at me on the phone saying that someone is gonn a pay for those parts. I am responsible for the cost of the parts?",

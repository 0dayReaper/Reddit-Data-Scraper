            "comment": "Hotwife and cuck aren\u2019t the same. Hotwife would be a situation where a woman fucks another man, and her husband openly encourages her and possibly (likely) participates, either during or after. A Cuck situation (for the most part) involves a bit of humiliation, where hubby just sits there and watches his wife get fucked. There are degrees of both, with gray areas in between. \n\nAn open relationship would be where the couple agrees to sleep with other people. \n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019ve never been a Cuck (so I can\u2019t completely speak to its nuances), but my ex-gf did some Hotwife (HotGF?) play back in the day, as well a being open.",

            "comment": "\"Open\" is like the name of the forest, and each version of non-monogamy is one of the tree species in that forest. Hot wife, cuckolding, swinging, \"hall passes\", FWB, and polyamory are all possible types of open relationships.  \n\nEach one has its own definition. All of them denote being open to some version of non -monogamy. \n\nSome are more open than others. (Polyamory allows for full relationships and love/sex, some only allow one type of sex in one circumstance, for kink fulfillment). And everything in between.",

Some kind of degradation/domination fetish.\n\nWhile an open relationship is simply a relationship without jealousy. Both partners are free to find other partners as they please.",

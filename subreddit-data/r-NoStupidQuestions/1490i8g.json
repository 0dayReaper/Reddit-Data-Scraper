            "comment": "Most files now are shared electronically. A court may have a Dropbox account for the case in which each side can more quickly deposit files that are relevant to a subpoena, may be exculpatory, etc. The meta data in the electronic files can show that a file has been altered recently, and if that makes the judge doubt one side's trustworthiness . . . they're gonna have a bad time at court. This then becomes something that may be legally known as \"tampering with evidence,\" which is a whole other crime. Best commit only one crime at a time, as the saying goes.\n\nWhen files were sent in paper form, the companies weren't really able to find every single piece of incriminating evidence and alter or delete it, so the tactic then was to send ALL of the paper. This was the \"bury them in paperwork\" trope where there is so much physical media to sort through that the other side wouldn't have enough time to properly look through everything to find any incriminating documents or hope that they were looking too fast so as to accidentally skip over damning evidence.",

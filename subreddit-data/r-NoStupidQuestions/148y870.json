From another perspective you\u2019re mentally ill and having trouble fitting into the normal world, so once you\u2019ve given up the charade of pretending to be like everyone else suddenly your menu of life choices opens up and you realize wow women really are attractive.\n\nThen there\u2019s this beautiful queer world where you can be yourself no strings attached and they welcome the misfits.\n\nThere\u2019s a statistically high number of people that are neurodivergent &amp; LGBTQ+, I think it says something about our natural tendency to multidimensional thinking. And statistically neurodivergent people have a higher rate of mental illness. It\u2019s all connected",

People didn't choose their sexuality. Where the faith has been forced on people and they want to leave Islam, I can guarantee you the people that don't want to be part of that faith anymore would feel a similar fear of not being included, fear of retaliation and similar mental illness rates, but I don't know if any studies that could back that up.\n\nPeople were locked up, treated with electro shock therapy, drugged and kicked out of home, sent to conversion camps which do WAY more harm than good, and also had pink triangles to identify them as homosexual in concentration camps, all for something they cannot control. LGBTQ+ rights have come a long way, but it's been in a very, very short span of time, and a lot of people's attitudes haven't kept up with that movement.",

At the same time, despite great progress in the last couple decades, queer identities are also still very stigmatized. Far more queer people exist than we realize, but many people are either still closeted or don't yet realize their queer identity due to internalized heteronormativity among other factors. \n\nThe same is true of mental illness. Realizing that you have a mental health problem and then openly admitting it requires a degree of introspection and vulnerability that people who are already openly queer are better accustomed to. With a higher proportion of queer people who are willing to admit/discuss their mental illness, it makes it seem like mental illness is more prevalent among those identities. Meanwhile, you have straight men with undiagnosed mental illness beating their wives and screaming about how \"kids these days are all wimps who need to make up mental disorders to feel like special snowflakes! I've never been to therapy in my life and I'm perfectly fine!\"",

While folks from many minority groups may face discrimination, and even fairly severe prejudice, they can often turn to people from their own community for strength. As bad as things get, they usually have access to folks who validate, support, and show solidarity with them. In comparison, many LGBTQ+ people are extremely isolated when they first come out. They may be the only openly non-straight/cis person in a community where difference is met with hostility. Worse yet, their own families may reject and stigmatize them for who they are. It is this isolation and abandonment by one\u2019s community, which is a far more common experience for LGBTQ+ people than other minority groups, which can be particularly devastating.",

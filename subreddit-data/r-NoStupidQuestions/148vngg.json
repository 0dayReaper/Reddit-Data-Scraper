    "postText": "Hi all this is directed at the gay community here mostly or well anyone can put some input in here. I 28M just had a guy over 27M very attracted to him and we were cuddling and watching shows and it escalated to some sexual activity mostly kissing and hand stuff. But I ended up making him climax and then after he tried to get me to climax and I just couldn\u2019t get there for some reason and now I feel awkward and sort of insecure and worried what he may think, he said it was ok but I just feel weird. How would you feel about that? I really like him, so idk what happened cause I was almost there like five minutes prior???",

At the end of the day that is the reason anything does or doesn't happen when it comes to sex. It's entirely possible that for whatever reason you just weren't comfortable with this guy. It may even be a reason you aren't even aware of. \n\nIt's happens to everyone. Best of luck.",

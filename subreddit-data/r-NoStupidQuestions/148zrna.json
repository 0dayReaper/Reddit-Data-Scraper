I\u2019ve been subbed to r/bodyweightfitness for years, though, and it\u2019s got a pretty dedicated user base and conscientious mod team. I don\u2019t want to switch to Discord, but I\u2019d also be a little skeptical of any sub that arises to replace it. I\u2019m not sure what will happen next with that.",

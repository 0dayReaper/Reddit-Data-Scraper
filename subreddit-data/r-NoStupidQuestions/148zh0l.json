    "postText": "It\u2019s probably somewhere closer to 2010. It\u2019s got an upbeat light style to it, and it\u2019s a guy singing. He\u2019s telling a story about a girl he likes who works at a food type place, and he imagines the two of them robbing a bank or something like that. He describes the girl a little deprecatingly, like liking her but also slightly putting her down in what he says about her. I think maybe the song title is either \u201c___ Girl\u201d or \u201c___  ___ Girl\u201d, like the blanks are adjectives describing her somehow in one or two words such as for example \u201cFood Truck Girl\u201d. \n\nI have tried everything to think of this song. Google doesn\u2019t help, chatgpt doesn\u2019t help, and tipofmytongue is closed. I can almost hear it in my head but it won\u2019t come to me. Please help!",

    "postText": "My older sister is getting married next year and my aunt from the Philippines would like to attend. Thing is, she\u2019s asking our mom (her sister) for a lot of information, saying that she needs it as proof that they\u2019re related and are willing to house her (my aunt would be staying with my parents for a month for the duration of their visit).\n\nThis includes scans of my sister and parents\u2019 passports (which kinda makes sense I guess) but also includes a copy of the title to my parents\u2019 house, 6 months of utility bills, and their marriage certificate.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love and trust her, but I just know that she used to always take advantage of my mom when they were younger, and something about what she\u2019s asking for just seems fishy to me. Am I justified in worrying or does it all sound legit? TIA!",

I would talk to [Immigration and Customs](https://www.ice.gov/#) to get their take on these so called \"requirements\" because it smells like fraud in the making",

            "comment": "I wouldn\u2019t say that someone \u201csuffers\u201d from autism the same way that someone suffers from Crohn\u2019s or from a broken leg, or even from something like ADHD. To me, the difference is because you can\u2019t separate the autism from the person? \n\nIf you break your leg, you are experiencing a deeply negative consequence that is temporary, an experience that you go through but it\u2019s not critical to the person you end up being. Maybe that experience will have a major affect on your life, like if you get cancer and end up as a lifelong cancer research advocate, or whatnot. But breaking a leg, getting cancer, being depressed - all of those things are things that can happen to you, and the fundamental essence of you is separate from the experience of having this disease or injury. \n\nFor me, I don\u2019t think I exist without my autism. Every single experience I have ever had, every thought, every love, every choice has been made and experienced through the lens of my autistic brain. My job is appealing to me because it makes sense to my autistic brain. My partner and I share traits that are deeply linked to our autism. \n\nI think of life like a great big tapestry. You can cut out pieces of the tapestry through disease, injury, or you can add pieces in the corners or redye a section or stain a section and still have roughly the same tapestry. But my autism isn\u2019t something that happened to me, it\u2019s intertwined with every single thread and every single fiber, sometimes in a positive way, sometimes in a negative way, but always there. \n\nPlus, a lot of what we\u2019re talking about when we say \u201cautism isn\u2019t a disability, it\u2019s a brain that\u2019s wired differently\u201d, what we\u2019re talking about is that a lot of the \u201csymptoms\u201d are more just\u2026 experiencing the world differently? I\u2019m not \u201cbad at making eye contact\u201d, it\u2019s just that eye contact feels very intense to me, very intimate, and it\u2019s not the vibes I\u2019m going for at work or with casual acquaintances. I\u2019m not \u201cbad at being social\u201d, I just interact with my friends in a way that makes more sense to me. I have strong sensory issues because everything feels more intense to me, but if I\u2019m not forced to wear clothes that don\u2019t feel good or eat foods with bad textures, if I can wear my headphones at work and be flexible to design my world in a way that makes sense to me, it\u2019s usually pretty okay. And on the flip side, I tend to experience art, music, literature, emotions very strongly, so it\u2019s not always a bad thing - I hate the texture of seafood with the same intensity that I love a good song. I heard a theory that autistic folks are different because they take in significantly more information than most adults do. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but it fits my experience - it just feels like everything is more intense than it should be, so the joy of a special interest is unparalleled but so is the dislike of a sensory ick. \n\nSo it feels like people who talk about autistic people suffering from the disease, it\u2019s like talking about someone suffering from being a woman in a male-dominated society. It\u2019s not wrong, per se, but the fundamental problem is that the world is not accommodating for people who think differently or act differently. I don\u2019t mind the way my brain works, it\u2019s gotten me my job, my partner, my hobbies, my interests, and I\u2019m living a great life. I have something to offer, a different perspective, a different way of analyzing the world. The solution is to allow for all kinds of diversity, not to force people to fit one way of thinking. \n\nThat\u2019s not in any way to minimize the downsides that being autistic can have. Some people have extremely high support needs and aren\u2019t able to experience a lot of life due to their autism, and as someone with relatively low support needs, I don\u2019t want to dismiss or gloss over the downsides. It absolutely can be a disability, and some people really wish they didn\u2019t have it. But to just say it\u2019s a disease that people suffer from is inaccurate and I don\u2019t like the way it makes me feel like there\u2019s something inherently wrong with me. Because if my autism is bad, then so am I, because it\u2019s an intrinsic part of who I am. So I wish people wouldn\u2019t put it that way.",

Having it, or being on the spectrum doesn\u2019t necessarily mean someone is suffering with it (in which case it would be offensive), but many people who are on the spectrum do suffer because of it (in which case it wouldn\u2019t be offensive). \n\nAssuming everyone who is autistic suffers with it is a generalisation that like most generalisations is kinda offensive, but it\u2019s equally offensive to be dismissive and assume that those who do suffer with it, don\u2019t have it that bad because \u201cit\u2019s just autism\u201d or something. \n\nIt really depends on the individuals lived experience and how they feel about it, (and even depends how they\u2019re feeling about it at any point in time) whether or not offensive or not to say \u2018they\u2019re suffering\u2019. \n\nIt could be just as offensive to say they are suffering, as to say they\u2019re not if they feel differently about it.",

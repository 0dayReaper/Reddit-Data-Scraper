    "postText": "I am old (54) and don\u2019t have any kids of my own. And most of my nieces and nephews live far away, otherwise I\u2019d ask them. So I\u2019m asking you all. I went to a big high school in the 80s where there was a core group of jocks and \u201cpopular people\u201d who pretty much dominated every single school activity. They were in AP classes, in student body leadership roles, in all of the theater productions, wrote for the school paper, were the stars of every class assembly, etc. If you weren\u2019t part of this core group, you got relegated to the sidelines where you were kinda expected to just be happy not participating in anything, and just watching the small group of people do everything. \n\nWe formed our own little side niche groups like the art weirdos, the goths, the new wavers, the stoners, the band kids, the kids that ran the school radio station. And of course every once in a while a \u201cweirdo\u201d would rise above and get a lead role in a school play, or become homecoming queen, just from sheer talent or undeniable beauty. But, for the most part, most of us had to lower our expectations and ambitions until we were out of that weird little bubble of high school. They\u2019d even have flower days when a local florist would hand out roses that students had bought for eachother in 2nd period, and walk around with their flowers all day showing everyone how flower-worthy they were. The first few semesters it would be only the few most popular girls and boys walking around with a huge bouquet of roses while the rest of us were walking around empty handed. Until we finally figured out that if we sent flowers to eachother it would be a lot less humiliating. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just curious - did all of the anti bullying campaigns and push to make things more inclusive change all of this? Are American schools less prone to being dominated by one core group, leaving almost everyone else out? Or has nothing changed?",

In Reagan era, and post-Reagan era high school we had a bunch of people with money walking around like they owned the school, and a bunch of other people looking up to them and gossiping about them like they were celebrities. I remember even one of my goth friends knowing who all of the jocks and cheerleaders were dating, and talking about them as if they were Hollywood elite",

I graduated a few years ago so it might not be super accurate. We had the asb kids who also did the school news, there was no newspaper, and no theater unless I missed it. The asb students were usually the ones taking mainly AP classes. I think they were also the ones you set up and did all the presenting of the assemblies but I think that was part of the role of the ASB class. They were also always the popular kids. They were easily forgettable unless you were part of their group though. \n\nFor the cliques, I don't remember it super well, each sport had their own group, even track and field had their own groups for each sport and they usually stuck together but outside of practice they didn't really hang out. It was mostly separated by race and grade. There was a small group of weird kids, but they were also sperated by race, a group of the trouble makers, the popular kids, the band kids, the FFA kids, there were like 3 goth kids, the lgbt kids, other than that the vast majority were just the normal kids who didn't really stand out.\n\nThe homecoming king and queen were the last ones you would expect but I think the queen was part of ASB.\n\nI don't remember anything like flowers but I am sure there was something similar that I just don't remember.\n\nAll in all it was a very boring experience even with 5,000 people nothing went on at all. Bullying was almost non-existent and the only the only fighting I heard of was an autistic kid kicking someone and the wannabe gangsters fighting over god knows what.",

We even had a couple of kids in the theater program go on to work in Hollywood (minor bit parts, but still,) and the editor of the newspaper went on to be a reporter with the news in San Francisco.\n\nI\u2019m starting to realize that it might have been my high school also had some over achievers (one of my friends Dad was a weather man on the same channel in San Francisco. Another girl got driven to school in a limo every day) and a huge wealth disparity, as well as this being the 80s",

I don't know what anyone's done after highschool really besides college or work.\n\nI think I just went to a poor area maybe? there wasn't one person that really stood out like that.

And the wealthy people didn\u2019t hesitate to flaunt it with designer clothes with labels on them, and their parents choosing to give them new cars in the school parking lot for all to see for their 16th birthday. This being the 80s the designers had their names emblazoned on their clothes. One of my friends shoplifted all of her clothes to try keep up with the rich kids.\n\n&gt; Once a month there was a news program with the \u201cnews anchors\u201d where they talked about stuff going on: I\u2019m guessing that took place of the newspaper.

Not the most popular jock in school being chosen for every single frikken activity. I know I should be over this by now, but my sister and I were talking about this a few months back, about how trying out for stuff we knew we were good at, but not making it, in high school really negatively affected our self esteem and our desire to even bother trying in life.",

One day the jocks all got together and threw food at the goths and new wavers. Someone wrote an article in the school paper interviewing several of the jocks about why they did that. They said \u201cBecause the alternative kids think they\u2019re so much better than us.\u201d How dare we have found our own niche and not worship them.\n\nMy older siblings told me that ten years before I went to high school the amphitheater was where everyone hung out, as the 70s were different times.\n\nI was just wondering if the whole 80s jock culture thing had lingered at all today.",

    "postText": "Should I report a strange encounter to non emergency?\n\nI was walking at a park when I had a strange encounter with a person, nothing serious happened but I'm wondering if I should report it to non emergency.\nI was walking down a trail when I passed a man. We exchanged normal pleasantries, he said \"how are you?\", I responded \"Good you?\" And he doesn't give me a response. Odd but nothing crazy. Then he just kind of stared at me, we passed each other. And he walked off the trail head towards the parking lot. \nI then went down the trail a bit, you can see the trail head from down below but from the trail head you can't see below. I looked back and he had returned to the trail head and was blocking the way, leaning against a tree. I took this as odd/ a little suspicious so I went a different direction and took a deer trail back to the parking lot. When I returned to the parking lot I saw him leave the trail head and start to walk back to his vehicle.\n\nWhile nothing happened, the whole experience felt off. Is this something I should report to non emergency? Or just forget about? \n\nTLDR;\nMan blocks trail head to wait for me to come back. Should I report this behavior to non emergency?",

If I wanted to report it I would have.\nI'm asking people for their opinions on suspicious behavior and asked about non emergency not the police.\n6 women have been found dead in the area so admittedly I'm probably on edge. \nIt was not the leaning on the tree or even the not responding I found suspicious. But him returning to the trail head to wait, that was suspicious. \nI understand it may seem little but reporting suspicious behavior can be beneficial for future incidents. \nI appreciate your view of this situation and just wanted to clear any misunderstandings about my intentions.",

    "postText": "I have been wearing contacts everyday since 2016. I started wearing biweekly contacts (acuve oasys) and switched to daily contacts in january 2022 (acuve moist). I've never had any problems with my eyes and no problems with contacts.  \nI went to Arizona in the beginning of May and about two weeks into my trip, I developed red eyes that would water occasionally. I would wear my contacts for about 6 hours before my eyes became very irritated and my vision became blurry. I used rewetting drops because I just thought my eyes were dry or that I had allergies. My eyes continued to water and get red. Keep in mind the fires from Canada and allergies could play a role into my dry/irritated eyes.  \nI went to the optometrist and she said I had irritated eyes and dry eyes. She immediately wanted to fit me for different contacts but I told her I have 9 months of contacts left and I can't afford to just get rid of them. She treated me with Prednisolone eye drops which I took for a week. At the same time she has me using eye drops 3 times a day for my dry eyes. I've been wearing my glasses since this appointment a week ago.  \nMy follow up is on June 19th where the optometrist wants to dilate my eyes and fit me for new contacts. I am skeptical about fitting me for new contacts because  \ni have 9 months of contacts  \nhavent had any eye problems or contact problems ever  \nthis is a new optometrist i am seeing. what if she is just using this as a way to make money off my health insurance?  \nshould i get new contacts fitted or should i put my contacts on after the follow up with her and see what happens? Has anyone experienced this with contacts?",

Or can you take your script to a different optometrist?",

Doc gave me a trial version of a different brand to try, they felt fine until they popped out all the sudden on my keyboard at work. I wore my glasses for a bit, gave me steroids, tried my contacts again &amp; I was generally fine. \n\nOccasionally I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night with my eyes on fire &amp; then my vision was blurry for the day, next day it\u2019s fine. went to a different doctor (I moved), it had happened the night before, she gave me steroids, it was fine for a bit. \n\nIt kept happening more &amp; more, I was using Visine (DO NOT USE VISINE) to try to help. Then one day, my eyes felt like they were on FIRE. I couldn\u2019t keep them open, the brightness hurt so bad. I\u2019ve broken bones, had various surgery but this fucking hurt. Called the doc, had me come in right away. I had torn the outside layer of my eyeball. Put a contact bandaid on my eye with steroids. She also had me use artificial tears to keep them moist. She also had me use lid cleaner (they\u2019re wipes to get rid of small debris which can cause scratching). This helped so much! \n\nI now clean my eyes before I go to bed, use artificial tears when I feel my eyes are getting dry &amp; use gel drops before I go to bed. I haven\u2019t had the blurry vision (eye tears) since. I use Refresh &amp; Blink drops now.\n\nI would follow docs orders, maybe get a second opinion but I would also suggest trying for above out as well. \n\nTLDR - wash your eyes &amp; keep your eyes &amp; body hydrated. \n\nMy eye doctor also wants the world to know to STOP using Clear Eyes or Visine.",

It Makes me feel better that someone else has gone through something like this to.\n\nWhen I went to my doctor last week she took a look at my eye and also said that the first layer of my eye is extremely irritated. Like I said she prescribed medicine and told me to use gel eyedrops three times a day to keep my eyes moist which have really been helping. She also put some thing on my eye (I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s called) which is on my eyeball directly and it is Supposed to serve as a barrier between my contact and my actual naked eye. She said it lasts about 4 to 6 months and supposed to help with dry eyes since the contact is not actually touching my eye. But once again I haven\u2019t worn contacts in a week since I have been on the steroid eyedrops. Is that what you mean by a contact baud?",

Gave my eye a chance to heal without being exposed to the air. So it sounds like your doc gave you something similar but a different kind. I am no expert though.\n\nSide note - just looked at my paperwork, I had a corneal abrasion. That may be what you\u2019re experiencing but I\u2019m not a doctor so hopefully someone with more knowledge on the subject can provide some more insight.",

Learn common mating patterns \n4. Learn some openings. There are numerous good openings. My favorite as white is the Vienna, but that's just one example. The caro-kann is an excellent black opening.\n5. Dive deeper into theory, study famous games move by move, while trying to understand the reason behind each move.\n\nAnd most importantly, while you're doing all of the above: play lots and lots of chess! /r/chess has tons of resources in the wiki to help you get started.",

I also watch people like Gotham chess on youtube. \n\nBut besides that, just playing online helps the most. Both actual games and puzzles. You learn from your mistakes and get better over time. \n\nLichess has some free lessons on their website. That's also the app I use on my phone to play.",

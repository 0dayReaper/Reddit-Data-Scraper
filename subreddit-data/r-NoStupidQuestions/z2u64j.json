    "postText": "I myself didn't know that you weren't supposed to put metal in a microwave until I was 19. I just never knew it because no one told me and because I never put metal in a microwave before, so I never found out for myself (thankfully). When I was accidentally about to microwave a metal plate, I was questioned why the hell I would do that, and I said its because I didn't know because no one told me. They were surprised, because they thought this was supposed to be common knowledge.\n\nWell, it can't be common knowledge if you aren't taught it in the first place. Looking back now, as someone who is about to live by himself, I was wondering what are some other \"common knowledge\" tips that everyone should know so that they can prevent life-threatening accidents.\n\nEdit: Maybe I was a little too specific with the phrase \"common knowledge\". Like, I know not to put a candle next to curtains, because they would obviously catch on fire. But things like not mixing bleach with ammonia (which are in many cleaning products, apparently), a person would not know unless they were told or if they have some knowledge in chemistry.",

Or technically there is, but so far as I know it's not very successful. It basically involves putting you in a coma, letting the rabies wreck havoc on your nervous system, and hoping you're functional once it calms down. More likely, you're in the hospital being given intravenous fluids until you die one day.\n\nRabies is no fucking joke. The vaccine is very effective, but it needs to be administered before any symptoms start. It's also not standard as a general precautionary measure unless you're at high risk of exposure, like if you regularly work with bats as part of your job or something. Most people who get the rabies vaccine get it after they've potentially been exposed.",

Wasn't until Mythbusters did a episode did I finally learn\n\nWater is denser than oil, so if you pour water on a grease fire the water will do two things\n\n1. The water won't smother the flames but will go straight through the oil, displacing the oil and causing the burning oil to overflow the pot or pan and run everywhere\n2. Trapped under the layer of burning oil the water will flash to steam, and the pressure will build until it erupts, sending oil flying in all directions. This aerosolized oil will then ignite in mid air\n\nSo you've turned a small fire in a pan into a fireball",

She was off the road so there was absolutely no need to move her at all but they dragged her body around for about 30 seconds before all the people screaming at them to stop managed to get through to them.

Even better tip: also call the pharmacy who filled the prescription(s) and ask them to run your combination of all the meds you take to confirm there are no really dangerous contraindications. Typically, this SHOULD happen automatically when they\u2019re filling your prescriptions\u2026assuming they know everything you\u2019re taking when the prescription(s) are filled. If you take A LOT of meds, your PCP might also need to get involved to do what\u2019s called a \u201cmedication reconciliation\u201d to confirm that all of the meds won\u2019t have bad negative interactions with each other, and to ensure all meds and their dosages are appropriate.",

            "comment": "This probably won't save your life, but not knowing could cause lifelong pain.\n\n**Breathe in before you sneeze.**\n\nIt may sound obvious. It may sound intuitive. But no one I've encountered has ever taken the time to explain why it's so important to have air in your lungs before you sneeze. So one day, I was telling a joke, and running out of breath, and felt a sneeze coming, and decided I could spend the last of my air on nailing the punchline then worry about the sneeze. Right as I had expelled the last of my breath, the sneeze decided it couldn't wait.\n\nWhen you sneeze, your muscles try to quickly, forcefully constrict your lungs to push the air out of them. This happens even when there's no air to squeeze out. For me, that meant dislocating two rib heads. Since that day, about 15 years ago, I have had pain related to that injury, sometimes so bad I can't sleep.\n\nNow, admittedly, I was a young adult and dumb, and trying not to cause a scene around my friends, so I didn't tend to the injury right away. As it worked out, I didn't actually get the ribs reset for almost 2 weeks, during which I moved from one state to another. All of that absolutely exacerbated my pain and contributed to why it became a lifelong injury. Treating injuries seriously is important, but people will tell you that part.\n\nPlease, don't make my mistake. Air is easy to get, put some in your lungs before you sneeze.\n\nEdit: To save my inbox from months of the same question, **I don't remember the joke anymore**. It was a timing dependent joke, getting the punchline just right was part of the humor, which is why I prioritized the joke. Most likely it was a long-winded pun of some sort, as that's the kind of joke I'd tell a lot back then.",

Don\u2019t do it.\n\nNever wrap a rope around your hand for grip. It\u2019ll burn, for one, but if there\u2019s a load on the other end it can knot around your fist if something goes awry. Fold the rope in your palm and hold it like that for grip. If it\u2019s not enough, you probably need a snatch block or need to take a different approach.\n\nA general rule of thumb for average people is \u201cno dynamic movements\u201d on unstable surfaces. Like, don\u2019t jump from rock to rock in a stream or try to jump from or onto a moving surface. Slow and steady might not win the race but it\u2019ll save your ass. \n\nThe proper way to hold scissors when handling them but not using them is to hold the cutting end closed in your closed palm. Seriously, teach your kids this. \n\nEvery material that says \u201cproper ventilation\u201d on it is serious. Open windows and set up a fan or use it outside or in an open garage. \n\nDon\u2019t store oily/flammable rags in a pile. They can spontaneously light up. Neat YouTube videos on this one.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how to use a tool, don\u2019t use it. From saws to forklifts, you\u2019ll hurt yourself or someone else or cost yourself money.\n\nNo open flame unattended. Ever. \n\nIf you have plugs or lights in your house that keep tripping, yes it\u2019s annoying but it means you have an issue on that circuit. Your breaker will only trip so many times, and you'd be surprised how many are defective.\n\nMaybe I'm an overly cautious person.",

The easiest way to stop an oil/grease fire in the kitchen is to starve it of air. Cover your pot or pan with its lid and that should do the job. \n\n3. Another method of choking out a fire is to throw **baking soda** on it. *DO NOT USE FLOUR OR YOU\u2019LL GET A BIGGER FIRE*\n\n4. Do not use a wet towel or wet oven mitt to hold hot things. It will burn you. \n\n5. If you are ice skating or even just walking on black ice, *BEND YOUR KNEES.* It will bring your center of gravity down and make you less likely to slip and fall.\n\n6. Clean the lint out of your dryer. If you leave it too long, it\u2019ll build up and potentially start a fire. \n\n7. If your pills say to take with a glass of water, try to avoid swallowing them dry or only taking a sip of water. Not only is water a vehicle that helps the medicine get to your stomach, it does other things such as help dilute it (if it\u2019s strong), but also prevent throat irritation from swallowing without an adequate amount of water (aka do you want your medicine to start dissolving/fizzing in your throat where your saliva is? or do you want to prevent that by drinking enough water to wash the little bits of medicine down your gullet?)\n\n8. If your medicine says to *take with food/a meal*. EAT A MEAL BEFOREHAND. Do not take that medicine on an empty stomach and chase it with your food. If your medicine includes this instruction, it\u2019s likely that it needs the presence of something in your stomach to soften the irritation it could cause on an empty one. \n\n9. On a similar note, if your medicine says to take on an empty stomach, try not to eat until after ingesting the pill. Some medicines absorb better without food in your gut. \n\n10. Clockwise is to tighten, counter-clockwise is to loosen.\n\nEdit: \n\n11. Wet a towel and put it next to the cutting board when chopping onions (paper or fabric it doesn\u2019t matter). The vapor that causes tears from onions are attracted to water/moist things, which in most cases, the nearest moist environment would be your eyes.\n\nEdit again: \n\n* Of course goggles work for chopping onions because you\u2019re preventing the onion vapors from reaching your eyes. I just wanted to give a simpler solution with something you may already have in the kitchen, aka a hand towel. \n\n* Yes I know what righty-tighty lefty loosey is. But it\u2019s not inherently obvious that it means [\u201cturn right from the top\u201d = tighten] when [\u201cturning right on the bottom\u201d = loosen] is a thing too. The phrase to remember how to open jars and bottles is to help children remember, but they can also easily confuse whether the direction means turning from the top or bottom. Saying clockwise and counterclockwise (from top view) breeds less misunderstandings.",

The biggest take-away, and I share it every chance I get.\n\nShaken baby syndrome doesn't come from shaking.\n\nMost frequently it comes from a sleep deprived parent that is at wits end. \n\nIn a single moment of frustration, he jerks the child. One swift motion, extending the arms and stopping suddenly, all while mumbling something along the lines of, \"Just stop it!\" or \"Come on!\" or \"I need one minute of silence.\"\n\nI was shocked to find out it wasn't actually shaking (not saying it doesn't contribute) but just that frustration-jerk that causes a lifetime of damage.\n\nSo, to continue to share what they told us and to up and coming parents. \n\nIf a baby is crying, and it feels like there is no end in sight. Check three things.\n\n1. Make sure the diaper is dry and clean. So change them to make sure.\n2. Feed them. Make sure they aren't hungry. \n3. Make sure they're safe. A crib or playpen that has no safety concerns.\n\nIf all three are met. Set the baby down and walk away. \n\nNo baby has died from crying. If the 3 are checked and followed, it will give you (or parents) a break.\n\nIt's ok to let a baby cry.\n\nRemember:\n\n1. Dry\n2. Fed\n3. Safe",

Secondly: Flowing water can be deceptively strong, and underwater currents are not easily visible. Also, drowning people can be more silent than you think. Generally be careful in and around water bodies.\n\nEDIT: It took me a while to think of some important ones: Grapefruit juice makes many kinds of medicine ineffective. Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of meningitis, sunstroke, hypothermia, strokes and heart attacks - they're not like the movies, and heart attack symptoms are different for women, and proper early detection and action can help significantly or even 100% save a life.\n\nSome that aren't very widely applicable: 1. Don't nitrate (apply nitric acid to) organic materials like paper or cotton - it makes explosives. 2. The most common fertilizer, ammonium nitrate, is also explosive under certain easy to achieve conditions. Store it carefully. 3. If you don't want your bottles of chemicals slowly and undetectably transforming into explosives, also avoid mixing acetone and peroxides. 4. Hypoxia (lack of oxygen) turns you drunk and feebleminded before turning you unconscious, so it's hard to impossible to properly detect and react to it. Hard to get into a situation where low oxygen is relevant _and_ you have a way to stop it though, unless you're a pilot, climber or diver, and in those cases you get trained. 5. If you're stopped by a train in a train intersection and in a hurry and it has passed and now you're eager to start going forward, keep in mind that another train could be coming the other way, masked visually and aurally by the first. 6. Snowblindness is a thing. Snow is pretty reflective, including invisible UV light. On a sunny cloudless day treat snow like the sun, if a bit weaker - don't look at it directly for too long.",

Any street drug even meth, ecstasy, anything you take off the street more than not has that fenty in it so be careful with alcohol or you'll overdose quick fast. Buy testers for your dope or risk dying if you drink while on them.",

Put a bit of food in it instead.\n\nThat's probably gonna sound like the stupidest one in the comments but I swear it has happened before. People be like \"damn, shit's still not boiling, it's taking time to heat up\" and then they touch it thinking it's just a bit warm.\n\nAlso don't do fireworks and alcohol. Too many people in ICU every year because they forgot they had a lit firework in their hand. Some recover the usage of their hand through surgery, some can't because the hand is too destroyed. It happens even with small fireworks.",

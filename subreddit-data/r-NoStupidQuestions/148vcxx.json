Currently having extremely high BP with preeclampsia..the doctors refuse do an induction until at least 34 weeks, even after requesting it done earlier due to how I'm feeling from the conditions. This got me thinking how come I could theoretically go in at , let's say , 7 weeks pregnant request and get an abortion but can't go in at 32weeks and request an early C-section due to X reasons ?",

Even though you are uncomfortable and having complications, the doctors have determined that you will be able to maintain the pregnancy for at least another two weeks.  \n\nThe benefits to the baby currently outweigh the risks to you.",

It does suck to need to make choices between your own comfort and the life and comfort of your baby.  It sucks even more when you don't have a real choice in the matter since doctors are going to dominate the choices being made.  \n\nRight now, two weeks feels like forever, but it really won't be.  Hopefully, they will feel the baby is developed enough to not need further delay at that point.  \n\nGood luck.",

The longer the baby stays in utero, the better chances he/she has of survival, less chances of medical issues, and a shorter hospital stay. So, your doctors have most likely decided that those pros of keeping the baby in utero outweigh the cons of your own health issues - they probably feel like you are being taken care of/monitored enough that they are not imminently concerned for your safety.",

    "postText": "I graduated from college less than three years ago and I feel like I\u2019m already becoming less intelligent. There have been many moments lately when:\n- I lose my train of thought and my mind goes completely blank\n- I can\u2019t problem solve\n- I can\u2019t pay attention to even someone talking to me\n- I have to reiterate my thoughts over and over to be able to come to a conclusion\n\nI always performed very well throughout school and I feel like my brain has become a lump of mush since finishing school.\n\nAnyone know of good learning resources?\n\n\nAdding post-posting for more context:\nThanks for all the replies so far! I definitely have a good starting point for getting my mind back into shape.\nFor more context, I\u2019m 24, exercise very regularly, try to eat as well as I can and avoid all added sugar, and limit my drinking to once a week (if at all). I am reading a book, but often have a similar issue where I have trouble paying attention to the story, and can feel myself trying to put the book down even if I\u2019m enjoying the chapter. \nI\u2019m going to try committing to reading more and practicing memorization on topics I\u2019m interested in.\n\nThanks again!",

It *might* be something that can be tested and fixed, like a nutritional deficiency or a sleeping problem or other things. Seriously, it could be as simple as a blood test showing that you need more of a particular vitamin.\n\nIf you tell your doctor something like, \"I'm having trouble concentrating or maintaining attention on tasks\", I bet they will have dealt with many other patients with similar symptoms, and will know the diagnostic methodology for narrowing this down, probably starting with blood tests and basic neurological tests.\n\n^(/ of course I am not a doctor so I can only say \"talk to someone who is more qualified than Internet randos like me\")",

When's the last time you read 5 paragraphs of something on there? Most of their content is aimed at people who never even built their critical thinking skills, and there is a lot of focus on (and therefore empowerment of) social media celebrities who are simply shitty people. \n\nReddit hosts a lot of longer-form content, enabling you to make better choices and protect your attention span, as well as connecting you to potentially valuable information (instead of stripping away all nuance and dumbing it down as completely as possible). Reddit also isn't centered around following individuals, but communities. Typically, everything is a lot more fact-oriented, and when something fails to be, you'll almost always have people calling it out and sharing sources. Not so much the case on TikTok, where misinformation is even more rampant, and a lot of the content is deliberately designed to be valueless.",

Try to focus and read uninterrupted for 15-30 minutes. It will probably help you with focus and engage your mind a bit. And do some light exercises and walking. Exercise is definitely underrated for the mind. I personally like walking outside without my phone for a period of time. And maybe a change in diet could help, like less sugars (specifically added sugars) and get more sleep if possible and hydrate yourself with more water. Some of this is probably generic but hopefully it might help.\n\nEdit: I did notice other comments as well, but probably even more important than anything I said is actually go see a doctor if it's a really big concern.",

So, I won\u2019t suggest any of that. Instead, I suggest:\n\n1. Board games\n2. Mensa website to solve puzzles\n3. Keep up with the news you\u2019re interested in\n4. Are you allergic? Having hay fever?\n5. Try probiotics\n6. Getting enough sleep?\n7. Time to see a doctor (I\u2019d honestly do this first)\n\nIf it\u2019s not medical, I recommend (1) board games. There\u2019s solo types of board games that really allow you to take your time. And plus it\u2019s fun. But games with other ppl will definitely help exercise different parts of your brain. I\u2019ve also used a (2) Mensa website, that gives me IQ questions and puzzles to solve. I literally have to bring out a pen and paper for it. It exercises different parts of your brain, and makes you think outside the box so it\u2019s definitely very useful in sharpening your mind. Over time, I got really good at this. Lastly, (3) read the news every day. Idk why this helped me, but over the past 3 years, reading the news on my Google feed every evening before bed made me smarter and philosophical than I ever was in the past 30+ years. Maybe it comes with age, perhaps? I\u2019m not sure. I suggest Google news because not only does it give you the most important news of the day, but it will automatically customize what it shows you by your interests, so it will keep your attention and you\u2019ll actually learn something bcs you\u2019ll want to.\n\nAnother thing that people experience brain fog and low concentration is because of (4) allergies. I had no idea I was allergic to something in Vegas air, but once I left, i was better. I don\u2019t know how you could test this. But you could try (5) probiotics. They helped me quite a bit, but nothing worked better than physically being away from Vegas. \n\nBecause of my seasonal allergies that turned out to be year-round Vegas allergies, I wasn\u2019t sleeping much or at all. Even though I was physically sleeping, I\u2019d wake up multiple times a night and toss a lot. My body was physically very stressed all the time and could never focus. If you\u2019re not sleeping enough, set aside more time for (6) sleeping. The most underestimated event in ppl\u2019s lives is sleeping. So impt for every function in your body. Because I left the insomnia untreated for so many years, or rather denied I had a sleeping problem, it developed into hypertension as well by the time I was 33. No family history whatsoever. \n\nIf you suspect it\u2019s (7) medical, I would seek a doctor\u2019s advice. ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s pretty sudden. The very first thing they\u2019ll want from you is to send you out to get a blood test to check your kidneys, liver, SOME vitamins, and all that cuz it\u2019s the least invasive and cheapest way to get a look at your health overall. \n\nI\u2019ve had this issue around that age and it lasted until I was 30. So here\u2019s a breakdown of the recent cost in Vegas for tests you will likely be prescribed by the doctor (without insurance):\n\nAll averages in Vegas, which is pretty low end, so your city may differ:\nDoctor\u2019s visit: $80. \nFollow up visits: $40. \nBlood test (basic comprehensive): $80. \nBlood test (more in depth): $175. \nMRI (head area): $375. \nMRI (spinal area, 3 different parts): $300-400 each part. \nSpecialist: upwards of $120.\nMedication: $20-$50\n\nMRIs will most likely not be recommended on your first few visits. That\u2019s just if the doctor suspects something. I had to do an MRI bcs I was experiencing phantom pain all over my body as well as haziness in my head.\n\nFYI, I still have trouble keeping my focus on READING a book. Sometimes, if it\u2019s not your thing, it\u2019s just not your thing. And I was a straight A student in high school too. Sometimes I wonder how I ever did that when I couldn\u2019t even sit through a single chapter of a book.",

This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.\n\nAnd that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few beers.\u201d",

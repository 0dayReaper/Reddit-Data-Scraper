They are using their hands in addition, probably because that's something they've done since before masking.  \n\nAs long as they aren't handling your food or shaking your hand before they wash their hands again, there shouldn't be any concern.",

Doctors and surgeons have done this since around the US civil war.      The mask protects others from getting exposed to what the wearer has.   \n\nIf the mask isn't that good, or if it shifts when they cough, then the hand is a secondary protection to catch spittle or other aerosol.",

If they don't wear a good mask, if they don't fit it properly, or if they cough so seriously that it shifts, then stuff escapes.   The hand helps then.",

He did seem kinda annoying.\n\nBut other than that; most comments in the videos relating to him are making fun of him for something.\n\nI also remember this [sketch](https://youtu.be/TyZSBqQ813c) making a parody out of him. \n\nCan someone explain ?\n\nEdit; I\u2019d like to clear I don\u2019t really know much about the guy. I know him off him popping up in my YT front page. Recently saw his interview with Alex O\u2019 Connor and then the one with Joe Rogan.",

The surest way to insult someone is to insinuate (or directly say) that their God is fiction. Nothing you say after that will penetrate their dislike.\n\nI'm okay people opining that God doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not okay with using false history to attack religion.\n\nTim O'Neill is an atheist. [Here](https://historyforatheists.com/2023/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-and-al-ghazali/) is O'Neill's look at Tyson's claims regarding Hamid al Ghazali and the Islamic Golden Age.\n\nThony Christie is also an atheist. [Here](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2017/06/14/why-doesnt-he-just-shut-up/) is his look at Tyson's history regarding Newton. Also [this](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/preach-truth-serve-up-myths/) from Christie.\n\nChristie takes a look at how Tyson takes decades of collaborative efforts and claims Newton did it all in just two months on a lark, all before he turned 26. Which is quite addled and incorrect but Neil doesn't seem to be pushing a narrative here.\n\nBut then Tyson goes on to say the super human Newton could have easily done Laplace's n-body work in an afternoon.[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfOpZD4Sm8&amp;t=3747s) But Newton supposedly just stopped when he started basking in the majesty of God. Newton didn't just stop. See [Luke Barnes' examination of this claim](https://letterstonature.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/neil-degrasse-tyson-on-newton-part-1/)\n\n\nTL;DR. I don't mind atheists. I am agnostic. Nor do I mind anti-theists. \n\nBut I do mind Tyson using false history to make his case.",

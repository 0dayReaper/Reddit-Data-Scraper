            "comment": "YES. Actually, this will be more beneficial than trying to start a whole exercise regimen, because you'll be able to keep doing it. It's easy to talk yourself out of going to the gym for an hour, but it's hard to talk yourself out of something that's going to take less than two minutes.\n\nBut the true magic of it is that once you're doing ten push-ups every day for a week or two, you're going to feel stronger, and you're going to feel empowered because you've kept it up. So you might up that to 15 push-ups. Maybe a week later you'll decide to add a ten minute walk. That'll become easy, and it'll turn into a longer walk -- and you'll realize that this daily walk is actually doing wonders for your mental health, too. Maybe you'll want to start doing two walks a day. Or the walk will feel easy that you'll say, \"Hey, I'm going to try to jog for 30 seconds and walk the rest of the way.\"\n\nThis is how genuine change happens. Small, tiny, manageable increments that you can sustain. I wish more people would preach *this* instead of big changes that are hard to stick with.\n\nYou've got this. Do those 10 push-ups. When it feels good -- and it WILL feel good -- just add a little something else.",

If you had two guys of similar height, one that weighs 220lbs and one that weighs 170lbs, it's not unreasonable to assume the 170lbs guy will have better endurance. The heavier guy is basically carrying around an extra 50lb weight vest over the lighter guy, so obviously that takes its toll.",

You can be chunky if you have a strong chest and usable arms, in fact with a lot of people it's a major plus.

Just looking up push up and squat variations should net you some info (e.g. the pistol squat or dragon squat).\n\nfor pull ups, when you hit 10 in a row, stick a dumbbell between your feet and do weighted pull ups.\n\nLeg raises are a good core exercise if you have a bar to hang from. Farmers walks are good too if you have something to hold thats heavy.",

I know how hard it is to organize a group of adults after 30, and that's tenfold if there's kids involved. \n\nIt's so important to keep these social connections going, and it's worth spending time and money to do so. Can you think of the last few times you did manage to meet up with friends and had a good time? How did you do it? What were the biggest obstacles?",

You want to focus on your entire upper body.  If your chest becomes too big without balance it with you back it can start to pull your back and shoulders forward and create a hunchback appearance.  This would take a lot of pushups but ultimately you want to build all your muscles so that everything remains in balance.\n\nA good way to do this at home is to get a chin up bar.  Combine this with pushups will really balance things out.  You can do different grips to target different muscles.  The same with pushups, you can change the location of your hands to hit different groups.\n\nYou won\u2019t notice anything if you don\u2019t adjust your diet as well.  You need enough protein to build muscle but also reduce fats, sugar and carbs that will make you gain weight.",

He and I were both lifters so the 55/day eventually became nothing. If you can do 20 or 25 per set, you can do a day in 3 sets. So I upped it and eventually my goal became 40K, which I surpassed. \n\nIt was a fun challenge and it was the biggest my chest ever got. But the mental aspect of having that goal and hitting it every day was the best part.",

You just have to make sure you\u2019re challenging yourself in that lower rep range, whether by using more difficult versions of an exercise or by adding weight.",

That's also good cause then you got yourself to exercise twice. \n\nSince it is also a plank it'll help strengthen muscles in your lower back, abs, and butt.  This will help relieve lower back pain if you have it. \n\nIf you get low and sink into your shoulders this will give them a deep backward stretch. That's great since our shoulders are often sunk forward while at computers. It'll also strengthen your rhomboid muscle which will help hold your posture.\n\nIf you do them really fast it'll increase your heart rate some. If you live a sedentary life, any opportunity to exercise your cardio-pulmonary system will be better than nothing.\n\nIf you do them slower they will increase strength.  Even if you stick to just 10 per day they will still get easier and easier. \n\nThen, if you're already down on the floor. Only if it felt really easy. Would you consider doing 11 or 12 that day?\n\nAnd if you don't do them for however many days, that's fine cause you can always restart now.  I don't have a schedule, but whenever it pops into my head I do some push-ups there. There is always some excuse that it's inconvenient and I'll do it later, but if I don't do it then then I'll forget about it later. \n\nSource: Three months ago I started doing 10 push-ups and walking my dog 2 miles per day and it was honestly a little difficult. It's been fun as it gets easier and it feels good to do a little more.  Three months later, I do 25 push-ups twice a day and walk the dog 2-5 miles per day. And this past weekend I went for a jog...

I run a lot, and whenever I see someone clearly overweight just huffing and puffing along, I absolutely admire them. It's SO much harder for them than it is for me, and it takes so much courage to stand up and start running. They are also taking that step towards being healthier. Mad respect to anyone doing this.",

You will slowly start to notice they get easier and easier every time you do them to the point where it seems completely pointless to only do 10. You will probably notice (slowly and over time) that your chest gains some muscle along with your shoulders and triceps (back of the humerus) as the pushups become easier.\n\nThe most important thing however is that you are putting yourself in a mental state to exercise and do something to better yourself. Maybe you do 10 pushups a day for a month, then you do 10 squats and 10 pushups. Now that's easy, so you start doing 15 of each. Now you decide you want to do situps too, etc. Slowly over time you can add other things in, until eventually you're stronger and more fit over all of even doing a full workout every day.\n\nIt's similar to taking the stairs over an elevator. Are those 2 flights of stairs going to make you lose weight or improve your cardio performance? Probably not, but you are putting yourself in the mental mindset of \"I'm a person who takes the stairs.\" That mindset compounds and leads to other things that help you push yourself a little bit more in other areas. \n\nDoing 10 pushups a day is better than doing nothing all day, and that is what is important.",

However a goal of 10 is easy to hit and if you feel like it, you can do more.  If you don't be happy you still hit target.\n\nMaybe 10 pressups, 10 squats, 10 lunges.  Establish a habit, then build on it.  Ideally find something you enjoy as that helps adherence.",

            "comment": "In the summer before 8th grade, I started doing pushups with basically the same mentality as you. I think I started out with 5 per day, every single day no questions asked, and increased it whenever I felt like I could go further.\n\nBy the end of the summer, I did 200 pushups in one day, in 4 sets of 50. Granted I was in kind of a sweet spot of puberty where I had testosterone but wasn\u2019t that big yet, but I guarantee you can make some serious progress with strength at the very least by doing pushups. Not to mention it will help tremendously with building up physical discipline, which will make it easier to add more exercises and restrict your diet in the future.",

            "comment": "What will 10 pushups a day do? it will do the MOST important thing of all. getting you to do it.\n\nyes it is worth it because the hardest thing to do is start.  \nit's not going to build you any muscle or anything but it will set a routine where you do some workout every single day and once you get that ball rolling it is easy to add more and more to it over the years.\n\nI speak from experience, I would sit all day every day until one day I randomly decided to do pushups and realised that I could barely do 3 and certainly couldn't do 10. this was terrifying to me as I am very light weight. this was a wakeup call for me, I decided I HAD to be able to do 10. in the following weeks I would drop and do my 3 pushups everytime I stood up whether to go to the toilet or refill my water or grab a snack, I just wanted to do 3 pushups as many times in a day as I could. after a few weeks of that I was able to do 5 then 7 then 10 then 12 and so I did 12 pushups once a day every day and sometimes 2 or 3 times per day if I remembered but at the very least I would do 1 set of 12 once every single day no matter what.\n\na little over a year later I was doing 20 pushups, 50 crunches, 30 squats along with a stretch routine once a day and every once in a while I'd do it twice in a day and when I was really motivated I'd do it 3 times (once before each meal) at this point I started doing HIT-High Intensity Training. I chose this way of moving forward and progressing because it doesn't take a lot of time.\n\nI wasn't planning on any of that when I started, I just wanted to reach 10 pushups and do that daily so I wouldn't lose that again.\n\nI am speaking in past tense for all of this because I had an accident and injured my knee last winter which forced me to take a break from it and while my knee is still wonky I recon it should be fine to get started again but I don't have the motivation to do it anymore.\n\nSo yeah what I want you to take away from this isn't the high numbers and various exercises I ended up doing, but where I started and what I wanted, everything after that I was stuff I decided to build ontop of the 10 pushups because I wanted to and you will decide what to do for your self but I HIGHLY recommend doing 10 pushups every day.",

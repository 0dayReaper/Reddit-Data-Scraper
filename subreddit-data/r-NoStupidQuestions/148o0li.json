In the past, those objects that are further away from us were already moving away from us faster than the ones closer to us. \n\nWe know they are moving faster because of something called 'red-shifting'. Light always moves at the same speed, but when something is moving away, the wavelength gets stretched out, so the light appears redder. And the universe becomes redder and redder the further away things are.",

But it would be pretty weird for everything to stop moving just at the time when we couldn't observe them. \n\nOne of the basic assumptions in physics is that the place we are at isn't special. That the laws of physics works the same everywhere and that the Earth isn't placed at some remarkable place in the universe.\n\nThat assumption wouldn't be consistent with space stopping to expand at different times at different places depending on how far from Earth they are.",

Or in other words, after x seconds each meter has turned into two meters, everything now being twice as far apart. But we observe the speed of objects in just m/s rather than m/s/m. But you can see from that equation that the speed as expressed in m/s will increase linearly with the distance to the object. If distances double in a billion years, something further out will have moved a lot longer in that billion years.\n\n&gt; They say the expansion is accelerating. \n\nYeah, the speed as m/s/m is accelerating. We find when we look back that things that are twice as far as way is not quite moving away from us (measured in m/s) at double the speed.",

We usually observe this effect with things like sirens from ambulances, which will have a higher pitch when the ambulance is approaching, and a lower pitch once it passes you. The motion of the object relative to you can compress or stretch the sound. Similarly, light can be compressed or stretched by motion of stars relative to us. Stars moving towards us will have slightly bluer light as the light waves are compressed, and conversely stars moving away from us will seem slightly redder. This usually isn\u2019t super visible to the naked eye, but we\u2019ve determined that the overwhelming majority of stars we can see veer towards the redder side of the spectrum. This leads us to believe that they\u2019re moving away from us\u2014 and so the universe must be expanding.",

When a star is moving away from us the wavelengths of the light is stretched, and shifts towards the red end of the visible color spectrum -- although some of the wavelengths shift beyond the visible spectrum.\n\nBased on this observable redshift in stars, we can tell that they are *all* moving away from us, seemingly faster than the speed of light. But since Einstein proved the speed of light is a constant, that *can't* be what's happening. Instead scientists have deduced that space itself is expanding in all directions at once, and it's also accelerating all the time.",

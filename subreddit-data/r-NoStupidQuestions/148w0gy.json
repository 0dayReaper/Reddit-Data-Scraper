Perhaps something used in the legal field? I\u2019m not sure, I do not speak any Latin whatsoever.\n\nThank you!",

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it is French though. I keep thinking \u201ca la mode\u201d which translates to \u201cin the style of.\u201d \n\nMy dang brain has terrible issues with word recall.\n\nMaybe it had \u201cper\u201d or \u201cpro\u201d in it. (E.g. pro se, quid pro quo, per se)\n\nEdit: take the place of :: accipere locum feels like it\u2019s getting closer to correct, but not quite it.\n\nEdit 2: it did use a conjugation of locum so that\u2019s cool. \u201cIn loco\u201d",

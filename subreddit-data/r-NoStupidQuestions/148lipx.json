    "postText": "Every graduation season you see articles about kids \u201cgraduating from college at age 13\u201d or something absurd like that. The articles always sort of have the responses like \u201cso proud!\u201d Etc, but this always struck me as\u2026 kind of unhealthy. \n\nWhat happens to these kids who are just so far ahead?",

The vast majority of the time they do not turn into adult geniuses. \n\nAnd it can be difficult living up to your childhood accomplishments because everyone expects great things. Merely leading a normal life, or even a successful but not extraordinary life, can feel like a tremendous disappointment. \n\nSome child prodigies lose interest in their area of talent entirely. Most become mildly successful in their area of talent but not adult geniuses who make major creative discoveries. But they often are happy to survive the transition to adulthood and enjoy their relative anonymity.\n\nEvery once in a while a child prodigy in math or music become an adult genius like Blaise Pascal or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. But that's very rare.",

At the age of 10 Macaulay Culkin was as talented of an actor as many 30 year olds, but at 42 he's just average 42-year old.\n\nI think some of them are continuing to be successful in academia, but most journalists are more interested in reporting on \"child genius goes to college\" than \"former child genius writes a widely-cited paper on computational chemistry\" so they probably fall off the public radar.",

I consider Christian Bale the ideal outcome- he was fantastic in Empire of the Sun- but him being a child star is just trivia since he's continued to succeed.",

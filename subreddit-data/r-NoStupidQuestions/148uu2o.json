    "postText": "What's the best dressing for a steak salad?\n\n\nI know this is personal preference, but I plan on serving grilled steak salad for 8 people (including myself) this weekend. I would like to offer a few different dressing options.  \n\n\nOther salad components will be leaning towards the SW US flavors, avocado, grilled corn, tomatoes, boiled egg, pickled beets, black beans, grilled zucchini, grilled onion, grilled sweet peppers.\n\n\nGuests will be making their own salad, thoughts?",

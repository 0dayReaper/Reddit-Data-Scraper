People aren't looking for honest, they're looking for someone who will tell them what they want to hear, and usually that means lying to their faces\n\nAlso, dealing with politics is more than just becoming president. To get that far, you have to work the game, and that usually means at least a small amount of dirty work, lying, colluding, and making less than scrupulous deals. \n\nIf a truly honest, good person was to be elected as president, we would first need truly honest, good people to fill the lower offices so that they could get far enough to be president in the first place",

If someone says they are going to forgive student debts, they're almost guaranteed a vote by someone that needs it. If they say they'll \\*try\\*, that vote isn't a guarantee anymore. If they say they will do it, and don't, they're \"not honest\".\n\nAnd then you get situations like what's going on here in Canada where one party will actively impede others thinking it makes them look better. Our conservative leader has been acting as if our NDP leader is doing something wrong by working with our current leading party to make the country better, because it makes the leading party look better. This makes it so that no matter how honest you think you can be getting into a position of power in pollitics, you won't be able to be, because you'll be actively impeded by other people with equal authority just to make you a liar.",

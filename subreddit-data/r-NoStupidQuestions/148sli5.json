    "postText": "I grew up around addicts and it really affects the way I see things. I have a hard time understanding why some are acceptable while others aren\u2019t. For example if someone said \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home and have a drink\u201d I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it. But if they said \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home and some some weed\u201d I would think that\u2019s wrong. Logically I know this is an incorrect way of thinking because alcohol causes a lot more damage statistically. But before I can \u201cfix\u201d my way of thinking I need to understand why some are okay and others aren\u2019t. Why isn\u2019t it okay to do coke, meth, etc. but it is okay to do tobacco, alcohol, etc. if they both affect you negatively? If you function are you really doing anything bad? Why are only some drugs bad?",

Alcohol is one of those things even though it's more addictive and more damaging to health than THC.\n\nAlso, some substances are so addictive, that they'll ruin your life. A social drinker who only drinks once in a while is much more common than social meth or crack smoker.",

            "comment": "part of it is the way some things are normalized/social connotations. we've had alcohol for an extremely long time, we tried to get rid of it in america and we couldn't, so it's normal. sometimes that kind of thing is done on purpose. a former aide to nixon talked about how they couldn't make it illegal to be anti-war, so they made as many public connections as they could between smoking weed and being a hippie/anti-war and then made weed illegal/did a bunch of scare press about it. this has happened with a bunch of different drugs. not to say that drugs are cool and fine for you, or that all bad press is made up, just that some are considered worse than others particularly because of these campaigns.\n\na big part of it is also that some drugs do more damage or are easier to get hooked on than others. weed isn't addictive the way something like crack is and has less severe side effects. so that's why many people are more cool w it and consider it a \"soft\" drug. and if you have \"normal\" amounts of wine with dinner sometimes, it won't be as bad for your body as having a little bit of heroin regularly.",

Methamphetamine and opioids are used medically and no one blinks twice. But when someone is putting so much of one thing into their body that they\u2019re depending on it to stay alive; when they take advantage of their loved ones in order to get their drug of choice; when they become angry and violent while high or drunk off their asses - those things are what make substances \u201cbad.\u201d It\u2019s not about the substance; it\u2019s about what people might do when they misuse a substance. \n\nThat being said, I also believe it\u2019s fully possible to safely use a substance recreationally, and not just alcohol. People have been consuming all kinds of things to make themselves feel good for as long as we\u2019ve existed. Creating spaces for safe use and monitoring the contents of substances, decriminalizing them, and implementing many more social services geared toward rehabilitation, prevention, and systemic change.",

But things like weed were introduced much later, and stuff like LSD were invented much later.\n\nAlcohol is so ingrained in our culture. It's not simply how many people drink vs how many people smoke. There are awards for good wines. Restaurants serve alcohol with meals. People have developed tastes on what alcohol goes with what food. There is an entire artform of mixing drinks and creating cocktails. There are games built around alcohol like beer pong. Alcohol has just incredible cultural infusion, that it is considered normal.",

Notice I am separating the concept of legality from morality, because those can be conflated, but should not for reasons that are presented within this post.\n\n***\n\nQuite simply, some drugs/substances are wrong, or have a bad connotation because of the legality of said substance. \n\nWeed is illegal and is classified as a schedule I drug. A drug or other substance that has a high chance of being abused or causing addiction and has no FDA-approved medical use in the United States. The reason why smoking cigarettes or alcohol are not seen in that manner despite having a worse track record, is, they beat everything to the punch. Considering their industries were established before other industries, they had a hand in influencing laws, that affect how we see other drugs/substances.\n\nAlso, the Nixon administration created the drug schedule classification system in an attempt to punish hippies, Black people, and gays. Yes, that\u2019s not exactly true, but it\u2019s basically true. Along with that, the conjunction of the American legal system and handling of addiction as purely a criminal issue and not social has skewed some perspectives and only serves to exacerbate the issue",

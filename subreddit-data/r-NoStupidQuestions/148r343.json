    "postText": "Last year, I got on a psychiatric medication called Seroquel and it made me gain so much weight in a short amount of time. It was terrible. I have never been this size and I\u2019ve always been thin or average. So, this is all new to me. I have medical issues. I don\u2019t want to make them worse because I\u2019m overweight. \n\nFor reference,  I\u2019m 4\u20197\u201d, a female, and I want to lose like 30 to 35 pounds. I want to go back to my normal weight of 100-110. \n\nAs for the walking, this is regular, catching the scenery type walking. It\u2019s not like those walkers that really walk fast and go at it with the walking. \n\nI also cut out Pepsi. Pepsi has never made me gain weight. But, I think now that I\u2019m older\u2026 it will negatively affect me. \n\nSo, for my second question; is it true that you can lose weight by cutting out soda? And do you know how much I can lose?\n\nFor reference, I drink 1 or 2 7oz Pepsi. Of course, if I\u2019m eating out I normally get the medical size soda. \n\nPlease, help. I can feel the weight being such a strain on my little body. My back hurts, showering is exhausting. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine people who are 600 pounds. Their lives must be tough. My heart goes out to them. \n\nThat\u2019s all. \nThank you for reading. \nThanks in advance for any advice or help. \nHave a nice day.",

That depends on how active you are otherwise in your life and how much you eat, and in particular whether you eat more to compensate for the increased exercise and reduced sugar intake. If you cut soda, get cravings and replace soda with candy, then that will not help you.",

            "comment": "You absolutely can. I went from 330lbs to 215lbs with just a diet and simple exercise like walking and low-impact routines. You're definitely on the right track. \n\nCutting out soda is going to be very helpful in managing your calorie intake and helping you lose weight. Water will do your body wonders. It took me about 3 days to get over the hump of not craving soda, but once I had water was all I wanted to drink. \n\nWalking - or any form of exercise - is going to help as well. It doesn't have to be that high-impact, sweat-till-you-fall kind of exercise. You just need to do something that burns calories. The biggest contributor above all else is going to be your diet. \n\nNow I know that the word \"diet\" brings up thoughts of whole menu changes and starvation in a lot of people's minds, but that's not the case. The kind of \"diet\" you should aim for is figuring out (based on your body parameters) what your recommended daily calorie intake should be and either eating less than that or burning the calories off with exercise. If you have a non-active lifestyle your body needs about 1600 calories. You can eat up to 1600 calories worth of food, but you have to make sure you exercise a little bit each day and burn some of that off to create a deficit. Being mindful of your intake and not cheating will help you reach your goal faster, as will increasing the amount of exercise you do as you go along. You don't need to be able to run a marathon on Day 1. Walk for 30 minutes each night for a week. Then, maybe, walk for 35-40 minutes the next. Soon you'll notice your stamina is increasing so take advantage of that. \n\nIf I could offer a few tips.  (1) Start off with whatever you're capable of doing. Don't feel down on yourself or pressured that you need to be able to the same kinds of routines and heavy workouts that gym rats do. With consistent and steady progress you will reach your goal. (2) Walk every day. Try not to miss it unless you absolutely have to. Taking 30 minutes to walk around can be therapeutic as well. Turning off the world and turning on your headphones with some good music is a wonderful way to spend the time walking. (3) After you have walked for a few weeks try to incorporate some low impact aerobic exercises. There is a Youtube channel called \"Fitness Blender\" and they have hundreds and hundreds of video of routines that you can do in your bedroom or living room. Find the ones that are called \"low-impact\". These are so excellent for beginners and all you need is your own body weight. No equipment, no gym membership. (4) Start off by doing one routine every other day, just to give yourself some time to rest. One day on, one day off. Maybe in a week or two - once you get comfortable with the routine - add another low-impact routine. Then go two days on, one day off. When you think you're ready, add another. Three days on, one day off but still walking every day. Don't stop walking. By switching things up your body won't get used to doing the same exact routine and your progress will increase more and more getting you closer to your goal.\n\nI sincerely hope you are able to reach your goal and wish you much success in the future.",

I probably will replace the Pepsi with Kombucha or this passion fruit juice I found that is only 30 calories. But, yeah\u2026 I\u2019ll focus on the water. Water is the best option. \n\nI will TRY adding more time to my walking as I go along and try the aerobics. However, I\u2019ve tried exercising several times in my lifetime (just to stay healthy, not to lose weight) And that thing that happens to gym rats where they\u2019re abled to increase their workout load\u2026 does not work for me. I\u2019ve never had that happen. If I extend my limit I can\u2019t breathe and pretty much everything hurts. \n\n But, I will try to increase when I think I\u2019m ready too. \n\nI hope whatever goal you\u2019re trying to aim for in the face of self improvement works out for you. \n\nThank you so much again.",

If you cannot add any more time to your walking or any additional routines then that is perfectly okay. I could never ask you to push your body past it's limits or endanger your health by doing so. \"Slow and steady wins the race\", they say. I am not sure if you enjoy yogurts or oatmeal, but one of the things that worked for me was having oatmeal w/ fruit for breakfast (which helped me feel full for a much longer period of time) and two low-calorie yogurts (60 calories each) for my lunch. When it was dinner time I was able to eat sensibly and a good-sized portion of whatever I made. I do believe that you will give this an honest go and I believe that you can achieve your goal. I want to again wish you the best of luck and a safe and happy change of life! Have a great day!",

A new medication can make things less straightforward though, so it\u2019s probably worth talking to your doctor as well. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely true you can lose weight cutting out soda, if you drink a lot of soda (and you do). Soda has calories. Consuming more calories than you need to get through the day will make you gain weight. You also need calories to live, so you can\u2019t just cut the calories from anywhere. Soda is usually the first weight loss suggestion because you need to eat, but the calories in soda are totally empty junk. It\u2019s not giving you any nutrients, it\u2019s not making you feel full like good food (or even not so good food), it\u2019s just dumping useless calories into your body. Cutting 1-2 of the little Pepsis from your diet will cut 100-200 calories immediately, without you ever feeling hungrier or really depriving you of anything of value. If you need the caffeine boost, try unsweetened black tea or coffee.",

This is because it's very easy to compensate by eating the small amount more that you need now they you're burning a bit more energy.\n\nA 30 minute daily walk, regardless of speed, is definitely beneficial for you though. So do it.\n\nSo you need to adjust your diet too. Cutting pepsi is a smart choice, it's a decent amount of calories that doesn't fill you up.\n\nI don't know how your diet looks, you might be eating so much that these steps won't really help you or it might put you on a good weight loss journey.",

She doesn't have a way to measure the calories going out. The whole point is that her medication changed her standard \"calories out\", and that she's trying to compensate for that right now and asking for advice.\n\nYes OP, walking 30 minutes a day can help you lose weight. It's also a good idea to cut out sugars such as soda, as they're very caloric but don't really help in making you feel satiated. You'll feel a big craving at first for sugary things but after a few weeks you won't feel a need for them any more, so be patient and resist. If you can afford it, seeing a dietician really helps. They can help you come up with meal plans that fit your taste, and they can give you advice on what to eat so that you're taking in less calories but also not feeling hungry after a meal.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I read all the comments and I\u2019m very appreciative of all the help and kindness. This is a difficult situation for me. So, having help in any way is\u2026 well, helpful.  \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, from doing research, I think my calorie limit is 1,200. It\u2019s quite low because I\u2019m so short, so I have less body mass. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s how it works. Pardon me, if I\u2019m wrong.",

Depending on your location, you can go through a care plan which allows you to take further steps into a goal.\n\nIn my case (of a neurodegenerative condition) a few years ago, had a couple of care plans which gave me access to physio, then onto a local YMCA gym with a PT to focus on fatigue resistance.\n\nWhile that particular plan isn't perfect for you, your visit to doctor allowed you to customise what you need.\n\nAll this is very dependant on where you are too.",

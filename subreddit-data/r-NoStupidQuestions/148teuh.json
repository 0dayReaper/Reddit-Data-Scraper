A level above that is Wilderness First Aid, which deals with the added difficulties of being somewhere where ambulances can't reach you (splinting broken bones, checking for spinal injury, building a makeshift stretcher, documenting additional symptoms as they emerge, etc.) I think the highest level you can get to as an amateur is a Wilderness First Responder course, which will teach you how to apply a tourniquet among other things and is intended for search and rescue volunteers.",

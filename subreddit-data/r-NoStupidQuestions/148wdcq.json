    "postText": "I received the standard letter for jury duty a few weeks ago and have to go next week. However, I'm a bit worried since I'm going out of the country on vacation in about three weeks. The letter itself says that my \"term of service is 1 week or 1 trial\", but I've heard that the length of trials vary. I also have to study for a big exam in two weeks as well, so one week of jury duty would definitely take away from any time to study.",

            "comment": "You can typically request to be dismissed from jury duty or have your service delayed  if you have a valid reason. Call the number on the letter or the courthouse you are supposed to go to and tell them you are a student and have exams and it would be burden and you can\u2019t do it.",

If it were expected to be longer they'd say so by listing 2, 3, or more weeks.  \n\nDeliberation isn't as predictable but isn't likely to be longer than the trial.",

The next time I was called for jury duty it was for a murder trial with 4 separate defendants who each and their own attorneys.  Thankfully, my plea for dismissal from the murder trial due to a more or less made up hardship worked and I was released at the jury selection phase and I was finished with my jury duty within the first day.",

    "postText": "This is a question I had ever since I saw the AMA where it was mentioned that the oauth based free usage limit for the APIs is 100 req/min per user. Now as long as you are a logged in user, why is this not enough for 99.99% users who are using the 3rd party apps?\n\n 100 req/min is around 1.67 req/sec, which is basically more than 1 request per second. Even including everything that you need the APIs for, fetching a thread,fetching sub listings, commenting, liking, etc. how many people will be doing these things at a rate of more than 1 per second? \n\nIsn't it reasonable to assume that for a very large majority, being allowed to do 100 reqs/min will more than suffice their needs? Am I missing something over here? Also as far as I know, all 3rd party clients are already using oAuth APIs for logged in users, otherwise you wouldn't be able to use the write APIs or personalized read APIs anyway. \n\nI didn't see anyone discussing this before, so I have to assume I am missing something, can someone please help me figure out where I am going wrong?",

In fact for all write APIs (making comments, voting, posting, etc.) the app has to use oAuth on behalf of the user only, which has to be already happening.",

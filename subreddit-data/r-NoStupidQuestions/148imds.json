    "postText": "Think about it this way, if the USA somehow invents Artificial General Intelligences (AGI) and puts them inside of drones, and then they ship them to Ukraine (or some other country that is at war), could the country that is currently invading Ukraine (or some other country) consider it a declaration of war from the USA because these drones aren't just regular drones but fully intelligent combatants, and so they could be considered, in a roundabout way, US soldiers? \n\nNow before someone thinks this is some weird political post, it isn't, we don't have AGIs in drone, this is a completely made-up scenario to illustrate the question, you could literally replace Ukraine and Russia with any other country or made-up country if it makes you feel comfortable.",

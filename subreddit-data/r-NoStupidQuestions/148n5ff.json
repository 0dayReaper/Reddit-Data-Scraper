    "postText": "So we have rats in the extension that is the bathroom. It leaks all the time as it isn't lined up there right, my partner had a look. You can't get up there it's too small. \n\nThe landlord said they'll send someone out but other than traps etc how will they fix it? Because they surely need to get them out or the whole loft/bathroom will stink? \n\nI've had rats and mice as pets and they smell bad if they are left for any real period of time. I'm unsure what I am meant to be making sure the landord/rodent person does? I assumed they would need to take the roof off the extension and lay the stuff down so it doesn't leak? Like from the outside?",

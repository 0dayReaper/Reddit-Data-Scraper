    "postText": "I live with a guy who currently squatting in the house I'm renting. He said that, if he attacks me, he'll be to sue me because he has squatters rights.\n\nI'm pretty sure that last part doesn't even make sense, but I think that he thinks he's going to get money if he assaults me. I'm not too worried about it, since I have 100 pounds on the guy and could kick his ass, but I want to make sure he can't live at the home anymore if he assaults me.",

Second nothing allows a squatter or anyone to claim money for attacking someone else. Even if they 100% legally owned the property and you were trespassing, they would not get money for assaulting you, or at least I know of no such place with such a law.",

    "postText": "Do I say \"Happy Memorial Day\"? Im 32, always lived in the States and still don't know how to greet someone on that day. Especially not vets. I was told \"Happy Holidays\" this last Memorial Day and I didn't know how to resond. She was an Army vet too. And I was thinking about this, for when I saw her. Too afraid to ask here at the time tho. Anywhoozy, I mumbled and sorta stutter out \"Happy Memorial Day\". And she laughed and asked me what I said. \n\nThe main reason I ask is because Memorial Day is not a happy  day for vets. It's in remembrance for their brothers and sisters in arms who died in battle. So... I didn't know what to say there. I'm just looking to not be offensive the following Memorial Days.\n\nThanks in advance.",

That or she was just messing with you, haha! I don't think there's anything wrong with \"Happy Memorial Day\" either because you are honoring people who fought. I personally would think it inappropriate to say to anyone mourning by the gravesites or reflecting silently at memory sites though.",

He said a) he doesn\u2019t feel what he did was special and b) it\u2019s not good memories for him so he prefers to not have it recognized. \n\nNow for families of those who have fallen, idk. It could be different. Families tend to feel differently about their service member\u2019s duty. There\u2019s a lot of pride there and admiration. So they may appreciate your thanks. What I would do is great them normally and wait until they bring it up. If they do, then you can give thanks.",

You shouldn't be getting sick this frequently without something wrong. \n\nWith that said, you could try wearing an N95 respirator when you leave the house and make sure not to touch your face without washing your hands.\n\nCovid precautions were in place for a reason. They work for more than just covid.",

And I didn\u2019t get shots either. I worked in public schools for 6 years prior to the pandemic and never got sick. Last year, I took Prilosec for a year for a stomach ulcer. Meds like this can affect how your body absorbs vitamins. I ended up with profound B12, D, and magnesium deficiencies. \n\nIn August 2022-Christmas Day, I had Covid (I\u2019m vaxed) the flu three times, and RSV. And now I have the flu, right now, for a fourth time. I throughly believe it is connected to my vitamin deficiencies. \n\nSo, ask for a full work up!",

I was sick my whole childhood and after I moved out it turned out it was because the inside of my bedroom walls were basically rotted out and full of mold. Could also be lifestyle things - are you getting enough sleep, like every night? Lack of sleep/inconsistent sleep is shockingly bad for you. Could it be allergies? Like did someone in your household get a new per or something? Are you working too many hours and your body can't rest and replenish itself? Your doctor can also help you figure out if it's something else along those lines.",

    "postText": "I am 15 years old and live in central Jersey in a high income suburban town. Our house is worth about 450k and my parents drive normal cars ( Toyota and Subaru). I went to a well funded public school k-6 a pretty expensive private day school for 7th and 8th grade (25k per year) and now I am a day student at a ridiculously expensive local boarding school (60k a year\u2026I know). My parents paid full tuition for my first year but we recently discovered we qualify for a 25k dollar reduction in price. It\u2019s very selective though (15% acceptance rate). I was bought an iPad at 7 a cell phone at 9 (which is the one I still use)and a laptop at 14 because so many rich people go to my school that they don\u2019t provide free chrome books. Also when I was seven I wanted a dog and my parents gave into buying it( they also kind of wanted it I think). My parents used to be teachers  but when I was about 9 that changed because my dad is really old (72) and he has enough money that my parents can  work part time ( my dad works 3 days a week writing for a newspaper and attends work related meetings all throughout the week and my mom only tutors about 10 or 12 hours  week). I am an only child so I see them and have their attention so much of the time.  I occasionally do things like empty/fill the dishwasher and take the trash out but not regularly. I have flown on an airplane 3 times within the US and twice internationally (always coach).we also go on road trips about once or twice a year. My parents had the money to sign me up for more unusual activities (Latin tutoring, flamenco dance).the points of this post is, am I super spoiled,over-privelaged? I know that I am obviously pretty privileged.",

You\u2019re privileged but the very fact that you\u2019re asking this question shows you\u2019re not spoiled. \n\nWhat puts you in this position and other people your age trying to attend a not that great high school while working as many hours as possible to help pay rent? Luck. If you thought you deserved your comfortable life while it was fine that others had to toil in drudgery, that would be spoiled.",

            "comment": "as other people are saying, you're for sure privileged. but that's not really a bad thing or a personality trait, it just means you've had more luck than other people. being \"spoiled\" depends more on your behavior than your upbringing. to use a small example, you say don't really have to do many chores now (which is totally fine), but when you move out, would you make a roommate/partner do most of them? or would you do your share of the work? my friend's partner for sure puts most of the cooking and cleaning on her because he isn't used to it/didn't have to growing up, and that sucks. as other people are saying, if you feel like you're better than other people or like you're somehow more deserving, that would be spoiled. but if you're, y'know, good to other people and aware of the ways in which your life may influence your perspective, then i wouldn't say that's any kind of stain on your character.",

Being spoiled means you think you\u2019re entitled to privilege, and you expect other people to look after you and support you. \n\nAt 15, you have had little to no choice about being \u201cprivileged\u201d, so you don\u2019t have to feel bad about that for a second. It\u2019s how you see yourself, other people, your empathy, your humility\u2014these are what make the difference whether that \u201cprivileged\u201d upbringing makes you a jerk or not. \n\nThe fact that you are self-aware enough to ask these questions and describe your life the way you do speaks well for you and suggests the potential to grow up to be a well-rounded adult with something to contribute.",

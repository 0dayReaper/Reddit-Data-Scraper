Growing most of the extreme cold winters but I believe they would still shrink a little during the warmest season of the year.\n\nAnimals will need to adapt or they might go extinct. Farming will get close to impossible without decent technology.\n\nThis would result in lots of hunger which will result in lots of people dieing.",

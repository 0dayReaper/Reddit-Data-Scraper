    "postText": "So I recently got a house with a 1 year lease on it, however things have changed in my life and I need/want to move out of the house towards the end of the year. Should I talk tot my landlord now about what it looks like to break the lease then or wait till closer to the end of the year?",

If you want to break the lease at the end of September and you need to give 45 days notice then give 45 or 50 days notice.   Telling them now means they might be unhappy with you and they might have people lined up and under contract even if you change your mind in July or August.",

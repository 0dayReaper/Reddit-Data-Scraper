                    "comment": "It's not free, true. But the cost doesn't seem in line with their costs, or perhaps their system is wildly inefficient. According to the Apollo dev, it costs them $166 for 50 million API calls to Imgur. Compare that to I think it was either $1200 or $12 *grand* under the new Reddit API price structure for 50 million calls. Apollo's 1.5 million users somehow costs Reddit an alleged $20 million a year.\n\nOh yeah, and all content generated through 3rd party apps and all tens of thousands of moderators donating their time to keep subs under control using 3rd party app tools generate value to Reddit. The API cost to me doesn't seem to consider what they get in return, and the demand seems to be instead of free API for free content and moderation, it's full price and then some in return for free content and moderation.\n\nTo top that off, apparently Reddit was fine eating the bill on that for over a decade seemingly without complaint. Not \"we'll try this out for a year and see where we want to go from there.\" Not \"how about we go halfsies on this, guys?\" Just free. Gratis. For over a decade. To then give something like a little over 2 months notice that they may have to pay millions for access.\n\nIf the official app was a better experience to these folks it probably wouldn't be as big of a deal to just make the switch. If the same mod tools were already in official, mods probably wouldn't have such a backlash to the announcement. At the end of the day, the users and the mods create most of the value, with Reddit itself just providing a framework for that value to be created. Just like how the guys on the production floor in the value stream are actually doing the things that make a company profit, while the guys in the office just sign off on buying the materials and paying the utility tab to keep things running. In a loose sense, this might be seen as akin to those boys on the floor having unionized and called a strike in response to the decisions coming from the office.",

I've seen some subs polling people to ask if they should shut down indefinitely and I'm just like \"are you actually hurting Reddit, or are you just throwing a tantrum that hurts random people\".\n\nMaybe I'm just wondering if subreddits being closed and eventually Reddit shutting down means there's going to be a huge swath of internet history that's maybe not completely lost, but at least effectively unsearchable and mostly inaccessible for the average person.",

What it is, is \"you foot the bill for your access, or you will not have access.\" It is in essence a ban though for the right price you can continue having access. Hosting and maintaining the API access costs Reddit some amount of money. According to leadership, they are trying to plug up expenses to get their balance sheets more in order. This could be cross checked with them recently laying off 5% of staff, another very common form of reducing expenses. This is believed to be because Reddit is looking to IPO (meaning get listed on the stock market) and would like to have the kind of numbers that potential investors want to see, though I don't think that's ever been outright stated. What has been outright stated is a claim that \"Reddit is not and has never been profitable.\" The folks who have actually thrown millions in investment at it have probably seen the books but are likely under an obligation not to disclose that info for independent verification. \n\nSo why do people care? Some people prefer the 3P experience to the actual official app. Some people apparently have issues with performance or stability that they don't have with a 3P option. Moderators seem to love the 3P options as they have better mod tools built in than Reddit itself provides on its official app, and I'm confident that that's a gripe they've heard for some time but never bothered actually fixing; now though there is a promise to make the official app better for modding, that remains to be seen how successful they are in the court of public opinion or if they even try. Others just don't like ads, and while they can just pay the recurring monthly fee for Reddit Premium, they can opt instead to pay a one-time small fee for a 3P and never see ads.",

For example, I sometimes use the YouTube API to upload videos, instead of using the normal webpage. The program I use to do that automates a lot of stuff, and saves me a lot of clicking.\n\nThere's lots of types of software that uses the reddit API:\n\n* Bots, such as the RemindMe bot, the haiku bot, bots that do useful moderation tasks (and also annoying bots such as the ones that correct people's grammar or copy popular posts for karma)\n* Web browser add-ons such as the reddit enhancement suite, that some people find makes Reddit easier to use, and ModTools that moderators find extremely useful\n* Third party mobile apps such as Apollo and RiF, that let people use Reddit on their mobile phones, or that make Reddit accessible for visually impaired users\n* Web pages that mirror Reddit data, and show you deleted posts, or provide a useful way to search Reddit, or summarise statistics on subs or users\n\nThe API price changes could easily make all of these disappear, baby and bath water alike.",

Every action you take on Reddit results in an API request, be it loading a list of subreddits, viewing a post, seeing the comments, responding or voting too. Kind of like how some phone lines are unlimited or pay per minute/message, if you are not on an unlimited plan you would get charged for every call or message sent, each API call is similar to using part of your monthly message allotment. \n\nReddit had been providing access for 18 years now for free. They want to start charging for this access now, which people in general are understanding about, as data is not free. The part that has people upset is the exorbitant costs that Reddit are charging. If the fees were more modest, apps like Apollo could possibly find a way to survive, but as it stands that one app alone would have to pay $1.7 million dollars per month to keep going and using that private phone line.",

They have better accessibility for the disabled, a cleaner looker, better customizability etc and that is dead now.  \n\n\nBut for mods, all of our third party tools are also at risk. There is no way magic eye bot or safer bot, or contextbot falls into the extremely small api request limit for free access going forward. It is simply impossibly for us as mods (i mod a gaming sub) to sift through the trash piles of spam without the assistance of these tools. It is impossible for safe space subs to filter out bad actors, it is impossible for political subs to prevent astroturfing etc, without these third party tools. Frankly if spez said fine all mod bots are safe, just not ios and andriod apps, the protests probably would not have gotten half the coverage they do now.",

The api is faster, cleaner, and gets to the meat of the content, without caring about formatting, adds, color, spacing, all that.  \n\n\nSeveral things use the api. Phone apps, mod tools, intelligent learning programs etc.  \n\n\nThey have decided that 1, they wont differentiate between api usage, (the fee is the same for everyone everywhere) and 2, that they will charge a fee literally no one can afford. Like not a single mod tool dev, or third party phone dev has agreed to pay it due to it being over 20 million a year in some cases.  \n\n\nReddit could easily make a commercial only api, for say google to use if they access reddits api, AND a for redditors api, that mods and reddit specific devs could use for free, but spez is too dumb??? bullheaded???? arrogant???? self sabotaging???? to do that.",

You as the mod decide what those subs are, it is not shared to any other sub.\n\nI do think our use of it is pretty niche, and I admit your perception of it being to uh create echo chambers is probably a little valid, but 100 percent not what we use it for, we just really hate cheaters lol. We also are extremely open about it unlike some other subs, it is hard baked into our rules, the people doing it (using cheating subs then using ours) know whats up.",

    "postText": "I wanted to get Sailor Jerry-themed tats but without the traditional sexy-boobfulness and without the super-patriotic-white-lady styles (I get there is a history behind Sailor J. tattoos -- I am not condoning nor condemning those styles or the person, it's just a personal preference).\n\n\nSo like Americana for now-a-kinda.  Since this country was built up by Black people, I thought it would be cool to remix a Jerry-styled-lady as a Black person (brown skin &amp; Afro vs. ivory skin &amp; that Rosie-the-Riveter-style-do).\n\n\nIf that's not cool, would a more stylized depiction of a Black celebrity be any different?  So it'd be an ode to a real person I genuinely admire?\n\n\nI don't want to use Black people as a \"style\" ala dreamcatcher or geisha tattoos.  But I also don't want to represent \"Americana\" limited to depictions of white-women when it comes to the tats that include humans.  That's not an appeal for me personally.  But I do like the bold style, longevity, simplicity and feminine-shapes of many of the Sailor tats.  \n\n\n My closest Black friend said she wouldn't care, but she knows me.  A stranger on the street has no idea or probably care of any intentions. So my stupid question is... this.",

    "postText": "It\u2019s an idea that i\u2019ve heard. That everyone is trying their best. Maybe it\u2019s a way to frame the behaviour of others in a way where one will develop compassion. It sounds very buddhist.\n\nIt also comes across quite fatalistic. That there\u2019s no choice, we try our best. That best could be anything, letting go of morals society deems critical being where I\u2019ve encountered people objecting to the premise.\n\nThere seems to be some randomness built in too. trying our best leaves the outcome up to chance some what, because it\u2019s not doing our best in the slightest. Doing our best involves a comparison. Trying is more of a direction.",

But if you assume the best, you\u2019ll see the best, and it\u2019ll change the way you act upon those around you. You\u2019re reading too far into it.",

It doesn't seem to imply that they're trying to BE THEIR BEST, just trying their best at any goal, altruistic or with ill-intent.\n\nIf I try my best to ditch all real world responsibility and get wasted all the time without getting into trouble or dying, I'm technically \"trying my best\" but not at anything that is good for anyone or anything, not even myself.",

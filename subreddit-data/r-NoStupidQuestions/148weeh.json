Even later in life I was often surprised of how little they knew about what their siblings were doing. But I've also seen them sharing the kind of bond most families can only dream of. The respect and trust they have towards each other is both absolute and earned and they support each other unconditionally. All of them have also made something out of themselves and grown up to be upstanding people so clearly the parents did lot of things right.\n\nI think it's safe to say that there was nothing wrong with their family and young me just didn't see beyond the surface level of their communication.",

I know my thought isn't the rule and don't have evidence to prove it but that's what i've read in some experiences!",

Make sure your loved ones know you love them.\n\nThere are only 3 people left in my immediate, nuclear family now. Me, my brother and my momma. Brother and I both have spouses. I have made it my goal to help mom if she needs it. Lol, the woman is fiercely independent except when it comes to grilling steaks/burgers or taking out the trash so I always help with that. Or damn cleaning out the chicken picken pantry! My goodness she always makes a mess, lol. And my brother and sister in law? Very good people. I have movie night every week with the older neice and nephew and hang out playing with the 2 littles whenever I can. \n\nAlso, crap, now I am kinda weepy. Someone's cutting onions",

Having gone through something awful like losing most of your immediate family in quick succession, it can be hard to properly process that kind of grief. Sometimes just talking to someone else about those experiences can help clear up those emotions. I hope you're feeling better now!",

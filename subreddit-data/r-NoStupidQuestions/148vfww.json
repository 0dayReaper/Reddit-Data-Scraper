Hell the average 50 year old can't afford that $85k pickup truck, or the $100k Cadillac Escalade in a responsible manner, a lot of those that you see on the road are written off as dubious business expenses.",

My payments are about the same as my sedan when I had it and my insurance actually went down. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly *cheap* driving a sports car but I don\u2019t really spend money on other things like eating out or shopping etc. \n\nSide benefit as a young person it\u2019s my first non co signed loan which well help me in the future if I decide to buy a home etc\u2026",

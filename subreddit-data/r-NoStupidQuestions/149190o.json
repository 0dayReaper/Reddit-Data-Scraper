Working with him feels like dealing with a robot - everything is highlllllly systematic and structured.\n\n\rSometimes it's blown out of proportion, but other times I find his points valid, which creates a contradiction.\n\n\rAre there any tips for working with intelligent people? Should I simply obey his, or should I frequently express my views on matters?",

It just means being extremely systematic and structured.\n\nThere are lots of different kinds or organization and of intelligence. \n\nYour boss no doubt has his reasons for working as he does, but you have to decide if you're happy with that. Plenty of people, and work places, are able to function without incredibly strict systems in place.",

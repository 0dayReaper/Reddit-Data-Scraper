            "comment": "I'm a native English speaker and honestly, it's hard for me to understand what the hell these people are talking about either. Sounds like a podcast version of trash reality TV and not worth watching.\n\nI gather from context the man refuses to perform oral sex on his female partner, and the women are arguing his partner will cheat on him with another man who will. The man says he is still waiting for that to happen. The woman in the middle says \"I bet you've never made a woman nut \\[orgasm\\] though\", to which the man responds \"it's hotter when they don't\".\n\nSo if I'm transcribing that correctly, basically it sounds like this guy is a misogynist who derives sexual pleasure from not pleasing his partner.\n\nThere's a greater context to understand here, which is this silly idea of an \"Alpha Male\". I'll let you dive down that rabbit hole at your own leisure, but basically some men have this strange notion that a \"man\" must act in a very particularly masculine way to be successful, and performing oral sex on a woman is not one of those things.",

I can\u2019t exactly speak for the lesbians on these apps but I suppose if every lesbian were to put woman seeking woman than the supply and demand would pretty much even put leading to better luck. Obviously this fails to take into account bi and pan sexuality and a bunch of other factors but this is my logical breakdown from a rather limited perspective.",

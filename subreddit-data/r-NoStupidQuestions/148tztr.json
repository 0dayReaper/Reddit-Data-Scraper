It means those without earlier experience feel a bit weird and isolated, even when they're not. As long as you're looking for a partner because that's what you actually want in life, and not just so you don't feel like an outlier.\n\nWhat really breaks my heart is when I see stuff on the internet that's like, \"I'm 15 and never even been kissed by a boy. I'm the only one of my friends who hasn't. Am I some kind if ugly unlovable freak?\"\n\n(Meanwhile when I was 15 kids were still making fun of each other just for having crushes.)",

There was a time in my teenage years when I couldn't even imagine myself in any romantic/sexual situation, or imagine anyone being interested in me or what I would even do if someone was. I didn't overcome that by specifically making it a mission to hook up with someone, more so it just came naturally as I continued to grow, have new experiences, put myself outside my comfort zone in other ways, meet new people, develop interests and passions, build connection with people and groups, get involved with causes, have adventures, etc. All things that lead me to becoming a fuller version of myself and gaining confidence. As this happens you become more attractive and intriguing to people, and you simultaneously are better able to approach people and initiate a flirtatious vibe. Sex/romance/etc will start happening naturally (not to say you shouldn't also push yourself to initiate something when it feels right) and as it starts happening a little, it becomes easier to see yourself as someone who can do that kind of thing, and you learn how to flirt and just get better at all of it, and it turns into sort of a snowball effect over time.",

I had my first kiss at 17 and I felt the exact same way that you are describing for years beforehand. And this was way pre-pandemic (so for you, 21 minus the three years of isolation is 18, right in the same range). After having my first kiss and later loosing my virginity and all that, I became more aware of lots of people who didn't have any sort of anything until much later. Everyone felt like it must just not be meant for them until it started happening, now no one even remembers feeling that way until we see questions like this. You'll be fine.",

And the worst part is that the guys knew I liked them. \nWell, as you can imagine, I have never had sex in my whole life. Now, at my age, and with a total lack of trust in people, I don't think I will ever be able to date. I remember when I was 19 and my dream was to have a family by the time I was 25. But not everything we want is possible. \nRecently, I was talking to a guy online, but unfortunately, I realized that he must have someone else and was just deceiving me. The chances of me trusting anyone are becoming minimal, I can't trust anyone enough to have a relationship, and when I try, it seems like they just want to deceive me. This seems to be my fate. \nI have no luck in love, and I know I won't find anyone. Can you imagine if I told these men that I am a 35-year-old virgin who has never been in a relationship?! They would laugh at me.\n That's why I close myself off even more. I know it's not right, but what can I do? I hope you have much, much more luck than me, indeed.",

At least you\u2019re clean too, there are many pluses to your purity but I hope you don\u2019t end up and incel lol, feel bad for those people, everyone deserves love. Call me wrong but maybe go to Vegas and hire a call girl to get \u201cexperience with\u201d\u2026 you could go to a club and find a thirsty girl just protect yourself for sure and give yourself a pass for one night, read \u201cthe game\u201d by Neil Strauss it will give you a new Perspective on indicators of interest and what works/doesn\u2019t\u2026 best of luck to your happiness I wish you well.",

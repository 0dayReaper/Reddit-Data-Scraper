Or more accurately, what we see as \"ourselves\" is a collection of electrical impulses and chemical reactions that have become self-aware. Once the brain is dead, you go to where you were before you were born, which is nowhere.\n\nI understand this is a difficult concept to grasp. The human mind isn't really equipped to understand nothingness. Even if we try to imagine it, it's probably a black void. But blackness is still something. We cannot imagine complete absence, and accepting our own mortality is extremely difficult and distressing. \n\nThat's largely why people invented the idea of the afterlife or reincarnation. We *really* don't want to stop existing.",

Nothing is something as it indicates absence of something, aka life in this meaning. \n\nI am not trying to say we will go to the sky and have cool life there, rather that I don\u2019t understand concept of nothing, when nothing is already something, aka absence of anything.

But you're confusing the concept of \"nothing\" for what it represents, which is the lack of existence, literally the opposite of \"something\". As a concept, \"nothing\" may also be classified under a parent concept, like a \"state\" or a \"noun\", but it does not make \"nothing\", something.\n\n[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking\\_the\\_map\\_for\\_the\\_territory](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory)",

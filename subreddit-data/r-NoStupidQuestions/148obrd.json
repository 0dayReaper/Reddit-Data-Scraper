The steadiest and safest method is the wheel method, but even this isn\u2019t fool proof and requires a ton of capital to get started since you\u2019re typically aiming for a 1% margin (i.e. investing $100,000 to get $1000 per trade.)\n\nSafest long-term is to buy ETF, especially since (in the US at least) selling after you\u2019ve held stocks for 1+ years gives you a better tax rate than holding it less than 1 year.",

Probably the best reason to learn to trade is if you want to get into the business of trading for other people, because that's a much safer way to earn money.\n\nThat's how Warren Buffet got started. Because he was successful more and more people entrusted him to invest on their behalf and paid him to do so.\n\nBut Buffett himself advises small investors to invest in index funds rather than paying fees to an active manager. That may seem counterintuitive considering his own business, but he's operating with huge sums of money on behalf of large investors who can afford the ups and downs of a volatile market. \n\nSadly, small investors just aren't on a level playing field with large investors. Despite rules against insider trading, large investors have access to much more information than small investors.",

If you are tempted to do 0DTE yolos and blow up your account then stay away.\n\nBut if you hold a lot of stock, there's decent value in selling puts to get a better entry on shares or selling upside calls to pay for downside puts.  Notice, the smarter way to use options is to sell them rather than buy them.",

Think of it this way, what are the realistic odds of more than half of institutions consistently underperforming the \"average?\"  In reality those studies refer to an after fee basis, or the portfolios they're referring to aren't 100% stock portfolios.\n\n\n\nThat said, the lesson is the same.  No, don't bother learning to trade.  It generally works out terribly not even taking in to account the time spent on it.  Just invest in index funds.",

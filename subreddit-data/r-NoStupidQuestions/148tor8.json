    "postText": "Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this, the place I would have asked this has gone dark, and I tried to post in r/personalfinance, but it won't let me.\n\nSo, student loan question.\n\nI got a notification saying my student loan payment is due tomorrow, so I logged into my loan provider's site to pay, but forgot I had automatic payments set up. So instead of making a payment, I decided to look at my loan info.\n\nOriginal loan amount was about $19,500. In 2008.\n\nCurrently at about $12,500. In 2023.\n\nIt says it's on an 86 month term.\n\nIt says I've already paid around $29,000.\n\nWhat kind of scam is this? It's only at 10% interest, so it's not even egregious. How is it I can have a $20,000 car loan at roughly the same interest rate, only make the minimum monthly payment and be done in 4-6 years, but even after *fifteen years* I'm still making payments???\n\nEDIT: it seems like the loan company put me on a plan that has a low monthly payment that barely goes towards principal. My fault for not looking into it sooner. I tried refinancing a while ago and was denied because of the school I went to, so that option is out. Looks like I'll just have to throw an extra payment or two at it every month, or switch to a different plan.\n\nOr both.",

If your payment doesn't include much principal then you'll keep getting charged interest on the remaining amount.\n* consider changing to a different [payment plan](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans), some of which offer loan forgiveness.

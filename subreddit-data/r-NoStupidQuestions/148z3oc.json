    "postText": "My friend and I have recently had a conversation about what we think from personal experience men tend to like in girls. For backstory, we are both college students and are at a similar weight. However, we have very different body types and while I have a slim waist, she has a bit of belly fat and fupa. \n\nWe were talking about what guys tend to like, and she claimed that all the guys go crazy over fupa / belly fat instead of flat stomachs and small waists. Like, all guys like to grab something, as it is nice and squishy in contrast to a flat stomach. It kind of startled me because my experience was quite the opposite. I\u2019ve never really met a guy who said this, even a guy friend. It made me wonder what guys actually prefer, and whether she\u2019s right? I\u2019m curious.",

As a generalisation men prefer women with flatter stomachs over women with chubbier stomachs.\n\nNow, are there men who prefer it the other way?  Of course.

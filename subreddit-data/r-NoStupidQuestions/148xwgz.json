Or knocks on my door and tells me they understand this world and I don't. Or stands at my train station and tries to get me to buy their magazine. Or fills the street with noise too loud to think over because of their self-indulgent gongs and drums parade. Or gets HR to send an email to all staff with their notion of how the world was created and which I Must Not Test With Contrary Evidence. Or runs ads on TV about their particular deity. Or runs ads in Reddit doing the same. Or repeats, parrot-like, their Minister's statement that the atheist's life model is unliveable, in spite of the evidence before their eyes that I'm living it. Or expels me from their church's house band because they discovered that I was not a Christian and that I was \"Satan in their midst, sabotaging the Music Ministry\" even though I was attending bible study classes and weekly one-on-one meetings with the pastor because I was interested in understanding more. Or sending me unsolicited Ken Ham \"Answers in Genesis\" screeds riddled with logical flaws and claiming that it's scientifically sound. Or, you know, asking non-believers to muzzle themselves in public forums.    \n\nWould that all those proselytisers would just \"let people live their lives\".",

They set the price point at a level where they know they'll make a positive return after the average expected number of fulfilled warranties.",

If ten people buy TV warranties for $10, and 10% of the TVs worth $100 each breaks and needs repair, they break even.\n\nOfc, if they\u2019re going for a profit, they might charge $15.\n\nIt\u2019s probably a strategy to improve the perception of the product and its reliability.",

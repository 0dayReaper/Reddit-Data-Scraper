I thought I was relieving stress, but I was just making myself more anxious. At one point I snuck away from a birthday party my friends had worked crazy hard on to smoke. Got caught by my friends and quit because I was so guilty.",

I would talk to myself \"am I really going to act like a dick head because i didnt get what I wanted\". I didnt like how it could control so much of MY mood. I like being in control of me emotions. The last thing I'm going to let dictate me is a cancer stick.",

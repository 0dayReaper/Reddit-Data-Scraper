It used to be the case that the score shown on a post wasn't the number of upvote minus the number of downvotes. They changed it in December 2016 so it's now a lot closer to that: https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5gvd6b/scores_on_posts_are_about_to_start_going_up/?st=j7uq8mfn&amp;sh=10b461cc.  \n2. Upvotes are still not 1:1 with karma though: https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_voting_and_karma.  \n3. After about an hour or so, votes get \"vote fuzzed\", ie randomly changed a little when you reload, even if there haven't been any real votes. This is to make it harder for shadowbanned bots to discover that their votes aren't working. https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_why_do_the_number_of_votes_change_when_you_reload_a_page.3F",

We can have conversations about politics, religion, disagree, and make cripple/fat jokes at each other and never get mad. I'm so incredibly lucky having a friend like this. I have another friend who's a mechanic, but we get along and disagree just as well. Neither one of them want anything out of me, and I don't want anything out of them except friendship.

You're not. \n\nIt's like someone posting articles about the Homeless issue and complaining about people not doing anything, but then that individual doesn't give money or food or help out at homeless shelters. Just complains about it, but then because other people can see them complaining, that to them counts as \"activism\".",

It\u2019s kinda like \u201cmore black judges!\u201d Instead of \u201ctear down the systemically racist system!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s very surface level and superficial.",

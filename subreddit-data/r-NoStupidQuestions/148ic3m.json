            "comment": "Traditional Northern European cuisine is influenced by the climatic conditions in the area. Historically it was hard to access fresh fruits and vegetables or spices during the long winter months. Many foods were canned or salted for preservation in the winter. \n\nThat\u2019s no longer true, but many of the restaurants in Northern Europe use the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables and spices to serve traditional dishes from other countries. Thus you can now eat Italian, French, Indian, or Asian foods in London or Stockholm.",

I want to taste those new potatoes and smoked salmon, not the dill and lemon pepper I dumped on top of it. That's bad, say these anti-northern types.",

            "comment": "It's a combination of a few different things I think. \n\n1) Foods from that part of Europe are reputed to be cooked with few, if any, spices. People imagine unsalted and unseasoned breads and meats and fish. \n\n2) Some of the more famous foods from that part of Europe tend to involve fermentation of fish. Most people in other countries, like the U.S., are largely unfamiliar with fermented fish (except maybe in some sauces). Many people know that rotting fish smells bad and can cause illness, so people presume that fermented fish will likewise be smelly and foul. The reaction videos for surstromming reinforce this belief. Seriously, the majority of English-language videos that discuss Nordic food are gross-our videos; at best, the host says \"it's not as bad as I thought it would be.\" \n\n3) Some people presume that any culture that eats piss-soaked shark (hakarl), rotted fish (surstromming), jellified fish (lutefisk), and similar foods must have a really odd sense of what tastes good. So they naturally distrust claims about other, more approachable cuisine from the region. \n\n4) Some of the most approachable foods and food terms from these regions have been so widely adopted and enjoyed that people don't think of them as foreign foods. For example, I don't think many Americans know that the term Smorgasbord refers to a particular kind of meal; it's just used as a synonym for \"feast\" in the U.S. Likewise, lox is ubiquitous in American delis alongside bagels and corned beef and pastrami. If people in the U.S. think of their favorite deli foods, they are more likely to make the association with Jewish communities in New York than with a region in Europe. \n\n5) With the exception of some Jewish delis, Nordic chefs never really opened up shops in the U.S. (I can't speak for other places). This means the food that does make its way over to us has to compete with established dishes that fill roughly the same culinary niche. For example, the classic British meat pie competes with empanadas in the Americas as a whole and with Natchitoches meat pies on the Gulf Coast. The pastries and breads of the Nordic countries compete with ubiquitous French and Austrian breads and pastries. The deli meats of the UK and the Nordic countries compete with American BBQ and german-inspired hotdogs and hamburgers. \n\n6) Great Britain, and presumably other countries, actually did go through a period of terrible cuisine that began roughly around WW2. Rationing limited foods, and so cookbooks were distributed that contained rubbish recipes that prioritized nutrition over flavor. And there was one guy, I forget his name, who was involved in the cookbook project and who hated fresh vegetables for whatever reason. He advocated for excessive boiling of vegetables until they felt and tasted like sad mush; I vaguely recall it was down to his erroneous beliefs about the best way to extract nutrition from veggies. These cookbooks were standard fare for many households, so many people who visited friends or family in the UK would find very disappointing plates of food unless they went to a specialty shop. \n\n7) There are several famous chefs from the UK who are well known in the U.S., and they almost all cook french cuisine. It's not a great endorsement of the food and culinary tradition if you feel the need to cross an ocean channel to learn how to cook.",

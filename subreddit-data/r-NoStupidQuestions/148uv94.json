I know with bouldering you can, but I don't know if there's anything specific that goes into safety, setting up a harness and etiquette that you need to learn first before you just show up somewhere.\n\nWe re in NYC if that matters.",

The gym will offer these.\n\nThere are self-belay devices, but not all gyms will have them.\n\nIf you are bouldering, you don\u2019t need anything.\n\nEdit: some gyms have designated times where you can go and staff will belay you, but again, not all gyms offer this",

It's a mess right now, but I feel like I don't have the energy to clean it. I start but then I stop and just sit and lay on my bed. \nI think maybe I'm just really messy or really depressed or really undisciplined with cleaning since I live on my own. \n\nAny tips for this!?",

Accept you don\u2019t *want* to do it. And then sit down on your floor and accept you\u2019re gonna be fucking grumpy about it for a little bit. \n\nThink of your room like a big circle and cut it up into manageable feeling pieces (i usually do 4 sections, one for each wall) and sit down with a trash bag near by, and kinda either toss things on my bed to be put in their home later, a pile of laundry by the door, or trash in the bag, and work my way through just that section, and then take a break. This makes it not feel like a never ending task and gives me little dopamine hits from completing a chunk, plus having all my shit sitting on my bed kinda reminds me I have to finish. \n\nWork your way through each section, then devote another time chunk to putting all your shit in their homes, take out the trash, and throw the laundry in the wash telling yourself you\u2019ll definitely fold it this time (You won\u2019t. But it\u2019s clean. So it\u2019s still a win.) \n\nKinda just accept that it\u2019s always going to get messy again, so there\u2019s no need to get frustrated with yourself when it does, and and set aside about an hour the same time on the same day every week to reset it and eventually if you can keep yourself on it it\u2019ll just kinda fade into the background and feel weird  when you don\u2019t get it done.",

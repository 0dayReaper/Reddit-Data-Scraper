At least in my case, my family's lakehouse is on a public lake, but a portion of shoreline extending out a few yards or so is part of their private property.\n\nThat said, there may be laws that allow for reasonable public use of the shoreline, or maybe the shoreline is public altogether. It really just depends. But no matter what, be considerate.",

Just to get off, I need to make concessions all the goddamn time like voyeur porn, blackmail porn, CFNM, public masturbation, hypno porn, cam shows, etc. \n\nI watch a ludicrous amount of videos for 30 seconds or until something outside of my very specific kink happens and I'm turned off. I can spend hours just looking for that one stretch of time in a video that's long enough to get me off.\n\nWhen I say \"exclusively\", I mean it: I had to get subscriptions for super fucking niche websites (and never renewed them because they weren't even doing what I wanted right, there's always fucking involved or they remove their clothes), buy custom-made videos and I came to realize that real life sex absolutely needed that component for me to even get aroused. \n\nDo you know how fucking weird it is to ask \"Look, I find you really attractive, I do and I do want to have sex, but if you could just pretend like you have to masturbate right now and do it in front of me without removing any clothing, I'll be ready to go\" ?\n\nIt's a goddamn nightmare, I live in constant frustration because I've watched the same 10 videos hundred of times, 9 of them being custom made just for my degenerate ass and the other being a 3-hour Japanese movie where a dorm of girls use human furniture with masks just for fucking themselves as the others go about their day (AND THEY NEVER MADE ANYTHING ELSE REMOTELY SIMILAR TO THIS, FUCKING WHY, I THOUGHT I COULD COUNT ON JAPAN FOR HAVING THIS NICHE KINK ON LOCK GODDAMMIT).\n\nI don't even know what to call this, closest I got, and that's just me who calls it as such, is a \"reverse Louis CK\" because literally no one has that weirdly specific kink. Some public masturbation videos do work for me, but they are so fucking rare and I probably saw all of them by now.\n\nAnyways, this is just to say that, yes, I get your frustration over trying to find stupid fucking porn videos that are ridiculously unpopular.",

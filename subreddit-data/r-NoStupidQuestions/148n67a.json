I'd like to collect scenic photos for art projects and would like to pay people for them while getting ownership of the photos. : ) \n\nThey don't have to be pro quality either, just photos of places I can't get to myself, like other states, countries, etc. (I'm concerned about getting the rights to the photo so it could be a one of a kind piece and don't want to use the same image or stock photo someone else might use.)",

Even if its just one other person and they live in another country, does it really matter if you both share one. \n\n2.) In order for this to work, the photographer would have had to have taken the photo and not put it on the market yet. Because any photo currently for sale would have had other buyers.\n\n3.) And finally, it would be far, far easier to just take your own photo and use that.",

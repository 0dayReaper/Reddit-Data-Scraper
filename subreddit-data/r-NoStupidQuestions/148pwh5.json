I do place them in a container with disinfecting solution every night.\n\nAre there any hidden detrimental effects to extending them beyond their recommended usage or is this just another way for Big Pharma to make more money?",

Daily wear lenses haven\u2019t been tested for the way you\u2019re using them (or if they have, they haven\u2019t been peer reviewed or published), so the risk of getting an eye infection is higher. An eye infection can cause blindness.",

People don't talk like that in real life, so even if someone is playing themselves, they need to act and speak in a certain way to ensure their portrayal flows naturally in the movie.",

In a documentary you'd just have a camera crew following them around.\n\nDid you watch Act of Valor?  They got real life military guys to to play military guys.  They were pretty shit at it.  They were wooden as fuck.  Are we supposed to believe that they go around their actual lives all wooden like bad actors?",

I mean, it's largely pretending, but there *are* other aspects.\n\nYou're a person who shows up for a sunrise crew call, and works until the day is called. You memorized your lines, and your blocking, and did them over and over and over and over again...and then again from different angles. You ate craft services like you live at a big summer camp for adults. You obeyed the marketing package, and only said what you were allowed to say. You were wardrobed and made up and trained, then performed until you were drained.\n\nActing is a *job.* It has coworkers, and procedures, and chores.",

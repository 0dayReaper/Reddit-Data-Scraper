However the Iphone and iMessage is prominent where I live, and it would be harder communicating imo. I also have an Apple Watch and Airpods, would that work ok with an Android?\n\nI also think it would be easier to set up an Android device (just logging in with Gmail) as opposed to Apple.\n\nIs the performance better too?",

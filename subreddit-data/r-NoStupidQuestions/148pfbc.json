Most are average to me in one way or another. I can count on one hand the number of people I\u2019ve met where in my head I legit thought they looked very bad.

And that, to me, is the barrier.\n\nConversely, ive dated girls i found very attractive, but was so put off by thier personality i found i could go no further, no matter how badly i wanted to get laid.\n\nSo theres gotta be a little bit of both there, for me anyway.",

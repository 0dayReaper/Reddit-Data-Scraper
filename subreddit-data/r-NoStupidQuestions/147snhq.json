    "postText": "This is something I\u2019ve been struggling for a while. The people living under our apartment have a toddler, and it cries almost all day long. Starting around 6 in the morning. \n\nThey take the baby out to their balcony, which is literally right under our bedroom windows. It\u2019s summer - windows are open and it\u2019s just like having a crying baby in out room. \n\nNow, obviously this is extremely frustrating. It\u2019s getting worse every day and I\u2019m just getting more and more angry. And I feel terrible about it. \n\nI\u2019ve no idea about\u2026 neighbour baby etiquette?\n\nNow, would I be a complete dick if I went downstairs and politely told them to please NOT put their baby outside so early, since it wakes us up daily and I\u2019m literally about to lose my shit?!",

But I\u2019d really appreciate if you didn\u2019t bring the baby outside so early. It\u2019s right under my windows and I\u2019m such a light sleeper, sorry! I\u2019d really appreciate if you\u2019d wait until 7 or 8 am to come outside\u201d",

Our kids are close in age, and when they were little, we would put our dog outside so she wouldn't wake up the baby. Sounds obvious now, right, but in that sleep-deprived stage it didn't cross our minds. Our neighbors politely asked us if we could not put her outside until 9 on the weekends.\n\nThere are going to be misses, however, and they might have another kid, or somebody else who moves in might, so you might want to invest in ear plugs or a white noise machine. For your sanity.\n\nAlso realize that you might be doing things that annoy your downstairs neighbor and/or wake up their baby.",

Trust me when I say it drives us fucking bonkers too.\n\nOh and OP? I would be happy if someone kindly told me my baby outside was an issue. Like it was mentioned, I bet they take it outside thinking it\u2019s the lesser of to two evils. Or maybe mom is smoking a fat joint too because her patience is at 0 and weed mellows her out",

There are however noise ordinances for the apartment complex and local city ordinances. Doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s a crying baby, too many times is too many times. YOU didn\u2019t chose to have a kid, they did. Their problem to solve, their responsibility to accept consequences. Residents moved around to different apartment units because of things like this. Options exist.",

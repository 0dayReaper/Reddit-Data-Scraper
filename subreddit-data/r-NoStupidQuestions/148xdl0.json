This makes it seem like he did absolutely nothing, which seems unfair because he did a lot of work in the beginning. From the amount of work he did we both thought he\u2019d get around 40-50%. According to everything I can find online anything 65% or less = F = 0.0 GPA, but this seems really unfair\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t he get like a 0.1 even just to show he didn\u2019t do nothing and raise his grade a little bit? Or is that really just how it is?",

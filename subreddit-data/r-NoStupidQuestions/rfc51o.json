This guarantees a level of funding that's not beholden to other interests.\n\nThere are also strict limits on how much  one can contribute to a campaign ($1650 per year for individuals and $0 per lifetime for corporations). Any donation greater than $200 cannot be anonymous.\n\nEven the candidates themselves can only contribute $5k to their own campaigns (no such thing as a Bloomberg candidate who just tries to buy an election out of their own pocket).\n\nAll of this is aided by the fact that our election campaigns last 6-8 weeks, not 3 years.\n\nMoney still has an undue influence in our politics but the scale isn't even in the same universe as it is in the US.\n\nEdit: The per vote subsidy no longer exists.

(this is why the LibCons lied about electoral reform to get elected)\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Canadian political parties just have better propaganda than American parties. For example, the private, for profit, Oil and Gas industry receives $5,000,000,000 Billion taxpayer dollars on a bad year, they got over $18,000,000,000 Billion during 2020. \n\nhttps://thenarwhal.ca/canada-oil-gas-pandemic-subsidies-report/\n\nIn a country of 38,000,000 million we are funding a private industry with titanic negative externalities with $Billions of our taxdollars. The same shit applies to almost every Canadian corporate industrial complex, from pharma to military, to forestry.\n\nThere is an insane amount of unethical money flowing around Canadian politics; we just obfuscate this dirty money much better than most countries.",

As others have said, it's undemocratic to tell voters that they can't vote for someone because they've elected that person too many times.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that it takes power out of the hands of people that are accountable to voters. Now, we can sit here and talk about the advantages of incumbency and all that, but the fact remains that elected officials have to stand for reelection to keep their jobs. And they're the only ones involved in the legislative process with that accountability. Lobbyists aren't elected, staff aren't elected, and bureaucrats aren't elected.\n\nInstitutional knowledge is an extremely valuable asset in a legislative environment, so kicking elected officials out right as they're getting enough experience to really do the job creates a power vacuum that's going to get filled by someone. And the most likely people to fill that void are long term staffers and staffers and legislators turned lobbyist. And while lobbyists aren't nearly as evil as people on here make them out to be, they're accountable to their clients not the people.",

I know that it sounds appealing at a first glance, but the whole point is that they don't have to worry about things like re-election so they're not beholden to anyone.  Term limits would be bad.  \n\nRetirement age?  That might be good, though again, it risks making the bench even more political than it already is.  \n\nFor example, lets use some recent examples.  Right not would be an okay time for a liberal judge to retire because they'd know that Biden could get someone in to replace them, but what about Obama's term?  The whole reason RBG was still on the bench when Trump was in office is because they knew that Obama couldn't get a nominee through.  The turtle made that entirely clear:  that he would obstruct no matter what until his party could do whatever it wanted. And that's what happened, as it turns out. \n\nNow imagine that same scenario, only she had no choice but to retire and everyone knew it.  \n\nOr, if you're not motivated by liberal politics, imagine if, right now, we knew that Scalia had to retire next year. 100% of the federal elections would be about that retirement and trying to cram people into seats in a panic to secure that seat, rather than about anything even resembling the actual politics of the people running. \n\nYes, the modern supreme court is way too political (and too powerful, to be honest) but adding predictable cutoff dates for the justices only makes that worse.",

I see comments lately about a fibre network rollout in my community and the unfortunate need to dig up roads all over the place as they decided to not go above ground. There is objection from some of the more elderly (and younger less informed people to be fair) saying things like \"All that investment and disruption just so some teenagers can download their films a bit quicker.\" without any of the understanding of how faster internet speeds help in many ways, business and social and yes, simple convenience too. \n\nAnother one would be the legalisation/decriminalisation/non-criminal sanctions for possession of personal amounts of cannabis, or other drugs for that matter. These efforts get blocked and the scare-mongering comes mainly from the Reefer Madness exposed generations. \n\nMeanwhile, there are young people getting full-on criminal convictions that do more harm to them than the pot ever could and in some areas the damage is life-long. \n\nThere really needs to be a good and fair spread of ages across politics to see the changes a good proportion of society wants without changes and progressive policies being blocked by a bunch of dinosaurs.",

Being old does not automatically mean you're a knowledge keeper or an elder. It's a huge commitment to gain appropriate knowledge, and then the community has to accept someone as a knowledge keeper. It's not a title someone claims, but one they are given. All this to say I think someone who has dedicated their life to knowledge and has gained respect from community would make an excellent leader in any capacity regardless of age. I don't necessarily disagree with you, but your story is a bit flawed and i wanted to correct any misconceptions.",

Many politicians can predictably hold their seats by simply being R or D, as long as they're not \"primaried\" by a challenger from their own party.\n\nIntroducing ranked choice voting, for example, would cause these politicians to face real competition from new parties and independent candidates. Few politicians are looking to make their election season more difficult to win. \n\nInstead of needing a 50.0001% share to your only opponent's 49.9999% share, you'd need to spend a ton of money and effort on name recognition, while fighting the good ideas of candidates who are normally \"outliers\". Normally their good ideas are extinguished by the inevitable march toward R vs D, but under RCV, one great idea from a first-time independent could secure his or her victory.\n\nCase in point: plenty of people liked Andrew Yang's proposal for Universal Basic Income. He lost the primary, and that was the end of the UBI discussion. Under RCV, you could vote for him and other Presidential candidates on the same ballot.\n\nThe current winner-takes-all (first past the post) system used in most US-based elections will likely only change if an external force is applied. There's not enough motivation for an internal force to propose change, and for a majority of legislators to vote \"Yea\".\n\n[Some parts of the US do use ranked choice voting for certain elections, or for overseas ballots with predicted runoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked-choice_voting_in_the_United_States).",

The fact that there is a minimum age has no bearing on the constitutionality of a maximum age.\n\nHowever, you could enact this age maximum in the form of an amendement, which would by definition also be perfectly constitutional.",

Yes. \n\nWe\u2019d need tests designed to weed out not just the more obvious, frothing-at-the -mouth, raving lunatics, but also the people who would set off nukes because some other world leader made fun of their hairdo.",

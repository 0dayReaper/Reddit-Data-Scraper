    "postText": "My girlfriend (23f) experienced workplace harassment when the owner/doctor aggressively pulled her by the collar in front of a patient and coworker. She filed a police report, but pursuing legal action seems impractical. The company lacks proper HR, and bringing up the incident may result in her being fired. She wants to find a new job, but she has already changed jobs twice in the past year due to personal circumstances. We're seeking advice on whether enduring a few more months at her current workplace or finding a new job would be better for her career prospects. Any insights would be appreciated. Thank you.",

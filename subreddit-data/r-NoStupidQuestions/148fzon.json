    "postText": "As a straight person I have to admit seeing graphic (and even non-graphic) gay intimacy/sex scenes in movies has also made me kinda uncomfortable. Like whenever there\u2019s a gay sex scene in stuff like Torchwood or Brokeback Mountain or Mysterious Skin or whatever other media it always makes me kinda look away a little, as a just initial reaction. I just don\u2019t like seeing 2 dudes banging hahaha.\n\nI\u2019m completely accepting of the LGBT though just to be clear, I just don\u2019t necessarily wanna actually see it in much detail haha. So I\u2019m just wondering for people who are gay do you see straight sex the same way? Or is it fine because there is still a one of each gender? So then would a gay man find lesbian sex kinda gross to look at? Or am I just a prude and nobody else feels uncomfortable at all with it haha?",

Consciously you might support LGBT, but if you haven\u2019t been exposed to different types of relationships and seen them much growing up (especially if you\u2019ve grown up being told they\u2019re gross) you probably have a subconscious revulsion to actually seeing them. \n\nI\u2019m a completely straight cis dude, and I used to find those types of scenes in media pretty gross and uncomfortable. I\u2019ve found that the more friends I\u2019ve made in the LGBT community and the more media I\u2019ve been exposed to showing different relationships, the less grossed out I am by seeing it. \n\nCurrently if I see a same sex scene in a movie, I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable with it. Doesn\u2019t do anything for me sexually, but doesn\u2019t gross me out either.",

You feel uncomfortable watching two guys kissing on TV because it\u2019s not a norm yet. We expect a certain amount of cliche from movie contents and a man and a woman in intimacy is part of such cliche, whereas a similar scene with two same sex persons is not.\n\nIn other words, we will get used to gay intimacy scenes as Hollywood pushes forward with the Social Agenda thing. Is it a good thing? I dunno. Do I feel forced? Yes I do. But we are already conditioned to accept a good looking pair of a man and a woman kissing hugging intercoursing in front of anything because that\u2019s what movies have taught us as a norm.\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019d feel uncomfortable, if not gross, to see a couple of ordinary people in real life displaying their overly intimate physical interactions (beyond holding hands or light kiss) in public. If my parents ever started making out in front of me, that\u2019d be gross.\n\nThe bottom line is, seeing other people\u2019s sexual interactions is gross in nature (unless you\u2019re being horny too). We are just used to watching those done by two beautiful heterosexual people on screen.",

If you browse gay porn for 10 min, you will be desensitized forever to Hollywood gay sex.",

So it would be unusual for someone to find it \u201cgross\u201d, even as gay man who has a different sexual preference, when we\u2019re conditioned to it. Must be nice though that you only rarely have to be exposed to these gross gay/lesbian scenes. Hopefully the next generations won\u2019t share your conditioned discomfort.",

Straight sex doesn't always gross me out, but sometimes it does and I think my personal threshold for \"gross\" is lower for straight sex than gay sex. But also, I find really aggressive sex to be gross and from what I've seen gay sex tends to be portrayed that way more than straight sex",

Straight porn is OK if the man is hot (and the camera shows him off well and a lot) and the woman isn't making ridiculously fake noises (do straight men really find that caterwauling arousing?). Lesbian (or rather lesbian-for-straight-men) porn is boring, but not gross, like strawberry ice cream. I would decline to watch it, but I would not have any visceral reaction to it.\n\nIn summary, you're probably a prude, but a lot of straight men are.",

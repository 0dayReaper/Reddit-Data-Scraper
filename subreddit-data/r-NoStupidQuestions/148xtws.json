Yeah, no. \n\nAnd reagan only signed the protocol because at that point there was an acceptable replacement for CFCs and his precious markets would be spared the pain of consequence. Oh, and by the way, the replacements? Still causing environmental issues, particularly HFCs which are a major contributor to climate change. So yeah, no, sorry, cant take credit for that one. It was ratified by a dem congress under reagan any damn way so, I really dont see the point of even bringing it up.",

These conservatives generally believe nature is there to be used by humans but not abused. They are fine with transitioning to a greener system but want to think about the people it affects along the way and how to do this with minimal harm to them. For example rather than just close coal mines and impoverish whole communities, we should slowly transition away and encourage retraining the workers for cleaner jobs. Of course the next issue is this work should've started decades ago but politics is too much of a yes/no situation rather than focused on real solutions so instead we got the worst of both sides.",

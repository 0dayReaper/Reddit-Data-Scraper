I had a plastic book bag and it had a particular scent, kind of sweet, no idea what it was, this was the 70s so God knows lol. Probably a mix of pencils, erasers, glue as well and such as well but it definitely brings me back everytime I smell something similar. Doesnt happen very often though",

I just casually said \"Thats my grandpa visiting\" he looked at me funny and said no one is here! I explained that my grandpa had passed away years ago but occasionally I get a whiff of his cigars and of my grandmas perfume. He looked a little freaked out and said, Like they are ghosts? I said yep, when ever I smell those scents I just imagine they are here checking up on me. It's not only me that smells in in my family, mu mom and my sister both smell them too. It's actually quite comforting to me to think that they are reaching out and checking on me.",

I've never encountered that exact smell again.

It was creepy as hell, straight out of the 50s in vibe, but I loved it because of the books and their scent. When I open an older book I get that scent... and I think the stacks in turn remonded me of my grandparents house and their collection of encyclopedias from the 50s and 60s, and the Foxfire books.",

Only a single person can be elected and that person is whoever gets the most votes, so it makes sense for ideologically aligned people to pool their resources and present a single person instead of all trying to win and losing to a different unified party.   \nThis is why endorsements from the same party exist and why third party candidates can never win more than a few percentage points.",

In that scenario, more people voted for the policies that candidates a b and c share, but candidate d won with overall more votes.\n\nTo keep this from happening, a b and c form a political party that presents 1 candidate with ideas that represent the majority of those 3 so that that person can, theoretically, win 60-40. \n\nThe problem comes when a party has similar goals between its in groups but vastly different ways of going about achieving those goals. A lot of people don\u2019t want to hear half measures but that\u2019s what they\u2019re presented with so they end up not voting because they don\u2019t like the candidate they\u2019ve been given.",

Then that candidate would compete against d. This kinda solve the problem, but in the general elections it's not *a* against *d*, but *a* against *d*, *e*, *f*, independent candidates who have almost no chances of winning because of the small reach of the campaign, etc. \n\nIt's sad that many candidates are lost because they have no support from big parties. But yeah, this is one of democracy's issues, or at least of certain countries interpretation of it",

Look at Biden v Sanders for example. Both are democrats and would likely agree on many things, but some of the key points Sanders was for are things Biden is not for which means the people who would vote for Sanders don\u2019t exactly want to vote for Biden. With Biden being the presumptive nominee, it causes a lot of those that supported Sanders, or any other democrat that differed heavily from the establishment dem archetype, to feel that they aren\u2019t being represented by the Democratic Party which leads to their votes going to a third party or not voting at all, which leads to democrats losing votes overall.",

The leading bloc of the Democratic party are moderate centrists who have become increasingly out of touch with the left-wing progressives.  The leading bloc of the Republican party are still moderate centrists, but they are being dragged election by election to the right by Nationalists like Trump, and to a lesser extent the Libertarian wing.",

He didn't have anything close to a majority, but you had a bunch of Republicans with very similar ideas and policies and Donald Trump. Because the vote was so divided among the more traditional candidates and they couldn't clear the field fast enough (everyone wanted to be the guy to beat Trump), the orange Cheeto got a huge boost to his momentum and steamrolled his way through the primaries.",

Advertising would be considered a 'non-monetary' contribution, taken at its full commercial value for the purpose of limits. So only individuals are allowed to do it, and subject to the contribution limits (IIRC it's about $1500). That's not enough to fund much of an advertising campaign, so we just don't really see much of it.\n\nThere are also *spending* limits on the candidate/party side during an election campaign, in addition to the contribution limits, and any of the candidate's personal funds used also counts as a contribution.\n\nMore here: https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=can/man/EC20155_c76&amp;document=p2&amp;lang=e#2",

Citizens United gave them even more rights, but not as much as people think. [Knowing Better has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhpy1uzOvrY) that explains it.",

This becomes a problem when things can happen such as: here allow me to take you to lunch at this super expensive place and we can talk, followed by something like, come to this wonderful resort where our next meeting is being held we'll pick up the tab, leading to hey, you're up for re-election here's a $25,000 donation on behalf of the auto industry to your campaign!

This, I believe, can be combated by making the transfer of money in regards to lobbying transparent. To account for every penny used to influence policy. \n\nAs someone pointed out reversing Citizens United would be a great first step. Though this would have to be followed up by further actions to help illuminate the sources of money and as to whom it is being paid to for their gained influence.",

Lobbying is not intrinsically bad: tons of advocacy groups and civil rights group lobby on a regular basis for their causes to be heard and represented. This is how we get politicians to vote for things that matter and actually make a difference. This is how we amend the Constitution!!!\n\nThe problem with elections is campaign finance laws, one huge broken law is the Citizens United case, that basically allowed unlimited amounts of spending on campaigning because corporate donations to campaigns = freedom of expression, according to the Supreme Court. The problem with that, is that corporations are NOT individuals the same way you and I are. They are a proxy for people who own businesses, to eschew any personal liability from the business owners. Ironically, by the Supreme Courts ruling, we have now taken away everyone else's freedom of speech who cannot afford to donate anywhere close to the amount these corporations donate/\"express themselves\" with. So we end up with corporations buying and controlling campaigns and influencing how the rest of us see (or don't see) candidates. This is why it is SO CRITICAL for people to do their own research beyond what campaigns ads show. They are literally buying your vote and telling you how to think otherwise, so they can put people in power who won\u2019t protect your rights in exchange for MORE POWER. \n\n Better video to explain the fallout of Citizens United \n\nhttps://youtu.be/k5kHACjrdEY",

Every American gets $100 to donate to a political campaign/cause of their choice every year, and if they choose not to spend it, the money is forfeited back to the government. It can\u2019t be used to enrich yourself by $100, and the total money distributed outspends lobbying by over 2 times.\n\nTotal yearly cost is ~21 billion dollars. That may seem steep, but the money used ensures that democracy can actually function and candidates that are elected accurately reflect the will of the people. For comparison, the US spends of $100 billion a year on the police force",

If we rein in Super PACs and campaign financing we are less likely to see these no win situations. Also the DNC and RNC chairmens need to be weakened and have their powers revoked or contained in a way that they can't create conflicts of interest and become indebted to candidates like how Hillary Clinton bought out the DNC and forced them to side with her or she threatened to cut off funding to them.",

If there is an equal distribution of rational consumers along the beach, each pushcart will get half the customers, divided by an invisible line equidistant from the carts. But, each pushcart owner will be tempted to push his cart slightly towards the other, moving the invisible line so that the owner is on the side with more than half the beach. Eventually, the pushcart operators will end up next to each other in the center of the beach.\n\nIt makes sense intuitively. If you like Joe Biden just barely enough to vote for him, why would he invest anymore in being a more appealing candidate to you? It doesn't make strategic sense, especially if taking a more extreme position to be appealing means he's going to turn off moderate voters. Very occasionally there will be a particularly galvanized election that pushes this rule, but in general this is why everyone is so centrist, and why the Overton window is so important. If you have to be centrist, then you better fight real hard to move the center as close to your ideals as possible.",

It makes punishing your own politicians a non-option and leaves plenty of time for the grifter class to get on with the grifting. In the midsts of that a bunch of exceptionally corrupt assholes has settled within the upper echelons of the republican party and turned it into the dumpster fire it is today. Anyone who criticises them is labeled a dissenter or secret democrat or whatever. They're genuinely terrible by any standard, and lots of their own voters really hate them. But who are they going to vote for? Democrats? This sub has plenty of examples of democrats who practically trip over themselves to hurl insults at anyone who's not already a 'real' democrat. Any criticism of the party gets one labeled a dissenter or secret Russian or whatever. Of course, voting third party is treated like voting for the enemy too.\n\n&gt;The net result is a bunch of entrenched voters who'll vote for \"their side\" no matter what, and a bunch of non-voters who are simply disgusted with the whole process and hope some hero will appear one day to clean up the mess.\n\n&gt;The real threat to that entire system is education and journalism, which have been systematically decimated in the US.",

In the primaries, the really invested, hardcore Democrats and really invested, hardcore Republicans are choosing a candidate. This leads to radical candidates; more radical than the general voting public. \n\nHowever, this also leads to people making weird judgement calls, like what happened this time in the Democratic election. Choosing the person who is \"electable over people who may be better humans and leaders. Or looking toward who they will be up against and who is better primed to beat that person, instead of just choosing someone on their own merit. This leads to some compromises in who is the \"best\" candidate. \n\nAND, these organizations that run the primaries are not without their own agendas. The DNC and RNC are private organizations, with leaders who want to remain in power; with leaders who have their own back-door deals, friendships, investments, and personal agendas. This can also lead to the true \"best\" candidates being screened out in favor of someone who can benefit a small few already in positions of power.",

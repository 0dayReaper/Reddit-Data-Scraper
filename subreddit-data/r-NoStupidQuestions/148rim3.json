    "postText": "So we were at this party thing, was school related so everyone was sober. And when we were outside in like a bigger group, a few girls were filming TikToks together . Then this one girl I\u2019m sort of friends with said \u201ccome dance with me\u201d so I did. Totally normal right? But then she said come closer to fit in frame, but instead of waiting for me to move, she put her hand around my waist and pulled me into frame. I was a little supposed tbh, but I didn\u2019t mind and we continued with the TikTok thing with her friends.\n\nIs this like normal behavior? Or is she flirting? She compliments me a lot, like out of nowhere, and we are sort of friends. Is this just her being nice?",

            "comment": "Yes it is normal behavior and no it doesn't mean she is interested in flirting or being in a relationship with you. She might be, I don't know, I don't want to tell you to completely disregard that it may be possible if you like her that way... But this situation had absolutely nothing to do with that. All it means is that she likes you enough as a person to have you in her stupid little video and finds you to be a good guy who isn't creepy or threatening to her. So don't go making it creepy now after the fact. \n\nYeah long story short it's normal behavior. She is at a party, having a good time, in a happy mood and that's the kind of thing people do in that situation. It's nothing to look into.",

Idk I\u2019m just a teenager, and idk how this stuff work. I\u2019m just not used to people grabbing me around the waist out of nowhere lol",

            "comment": "First and foremost, be sure you're aware that not every interaction with a woman is related to flirting/sex/love, and often times men will see what they want to see in situations like yours, which then leads to awkward misunderstandings.\n\nSecond, be sure to not rely too heavily upon the internet to run your life for you. The temptation to ask for advice and/or guidance can be hard to resist, but this is your life, and you know your life better than anyone else on Earth.\n\nThird and finally, in my honest opinion... I see this as nothing more than her just being a good friend, not as an attempt at flirting with you.",

On top of that my ex (when we were still together) told me she definitely had at one point, or has a crush on me. There was also the group of guys snickering while it happened. But tbh, I\u2019m not sure, she might just have been friendly. Don\u2019t really matter tho, no matter if she flirting or being friendly, I still have a good friend lol",

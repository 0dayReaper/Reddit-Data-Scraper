This being the case I am seriously asking y'all for app recommendations, as the content guidelines of Wattpad seem contradictory. I tried googling to no avail, so please, I need a new haven to continue this outlet and hobby of mine!\n\nEdit: I ~~need~~ would like as many answers as possible in order to broaden my horizons of possibility!",

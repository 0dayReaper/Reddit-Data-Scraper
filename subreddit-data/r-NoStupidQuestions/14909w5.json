Same reason an electric eel can only really stun something right next to it, rather than kill every single fish in the area.",

Lehal to both swimmers and marine life and can damage ships. But most animals just go lower beneath the surface to evade harm. It\u2019s actually a problem with sharks because they seek shallower water which puts them at higher risk of being struck by lightening. \n\nBut generally direct strikes to marine life is rare (but will be lethal). If it\u2019s a confined water area like a small pond one strike could kill everything in it.",

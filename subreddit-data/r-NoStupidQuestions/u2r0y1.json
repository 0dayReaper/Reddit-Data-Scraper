    "postText": "Propaganda is certainly in full swing on both sides but the narrative, from a western perspective, is that Russia has royally screwed the pooch during this invasion. If we are to believe what is being spoken it seems like they are just throwing meat and materials into the grinder in Ukraine and getting obliterated. Are the Russians truly taking such monumental losses and is their economy soon to be as fucked as people claim?",

                    "comment": "The one thing often left out from the narrative is that Ukraine in 2014 had a pathetic military, they had a very small professional corps, and then had to rely on militia for the rest, so when the breakaway republics first rose up they initially had success pushing Ukraine back, but when the tide turned Russia gave them the ultimatum that froze the war for  the last 8 years. If this war had happened then, Ukraine would have been crushed, but over these last 8 years they have been steadily building up their military, training their people into proper soldiers, receiving military aid from the west, etc, until they had a very competent military with a large core of veterans. \n\n\nRussia's biggest strategic failure was giving Ukraine the necessary time to turn themselves into something more than a speedbump",

                            "comment": "A big part of that is that the two nations\u2019 militaries have been growing along entirely different lines. \n\nFor the first decade and more of Ukraine\u2019s existence as a separate nation, its military was quite similar to that of Russia - not a surprise, as they shared a common origin. However, after 2014, Ukraine underwent an intensive program of military reform. The key aspect of this was to create a significant NCO and junior officer presence, modelled on (and with the help of) Western nations. This is key, because NCOs and junior officers actually lead soldiers into battle and handle the day to day affairs of war; good NCOs and junior officers can be expected to take responsibility for the situation in the ground, lead by example, take initiative, all that good stuff. \n\nThe Russians, on the other hand, dove even deeper into some of the flawed aspects of the Soviet system -  a weak NCO class, an army top-heavy with senior officers leading unmotivated soldiers. The Russian system has a lot of weaknesses, a major one being a lack of initiative taken by soldiers at the sharp end - they tend to do only what they are told, when they are told. \n\n(This partly explains why so many senior Russian officers have been killed in this war - they go to the front to try to get things moving). \n\nIf this analysis is correct, this isn\u2019t a flaw the Russians can easily fix. They can replace one senior officer with another easily enough, but they can\u2019t create a motivated and professional NCO class quickly - this takes years.",

I think it might've gone more smoothly if there was a clear \"You're invading to conquer Ukraine\" from day one instead of this \"You're just on the border for training exercises... But now you gotta go in for peacekeeping in a newly independent Donbas...  But now you gotta go all the way to Ukraine's capital to end the Nazi threat.\"\n\nI get they were trying (in vain) to create plausible deniability, but I can imagine a lot of soldiers on the ground thinking this is some bullshit how the reason they were there kept changing week to week.",

This is a major factor in why they are fighting with such ferocity. \n\nWhy are the Russians fighting? The exact reason varies from day to day. Overall, they are fighting for national glory, to recreate a Russian empire. Many Russians may agree that this is a worthy goal (I mean, there is evidence the war is genuinely popular within Russia, regardless of its propaganda), but the soldiers at the sharp end being asked to fight and possibly die for this apparently find this motive less compelling than their Ukrainian adversaries. Particularly as they were hardly prepared for this - as you note, they were fed a bunch of nonsense leading up to the invasion. \n\nThere are of course other reasons for low Russian morale (the endemic corruption and brutality others have noted), but this is a big factor. They just aren\u2019t fighting for a cause many are truly willing to die for.",

The west is supplying Ukraine civilians arms and weaponry day by day. It's just not possible for a 1:40 ratio to control the population in the major cities. Sure, not all of them have arms, but even just molotov's alone would be enough to staggenate the Russians. The only way they would be able to do it would be carpet bombing, chemical warfare, or nuclear warfare, which they're already resorting to the first 2.",

That's what is happening now.\n\nWith that said, NATO's eastern members have some legacy stuff that's been retrofitted and rearmed. A MIG-29 might not sound like much, but if it is armed with modern NATO arms it's a very dangerous foe to face. It all depends on what they are getting. We obviously have no idea.

It's politically popular to give weapons to Ukraine both before and after Bucha. That gives the government a window to spend on weapons like Patriot missiles or F-15s. With that said, the US is far from the only supplier.\n\nGermany has ordered the Israeli Arrow system instead of the Patriot system. Serbia ordered and received a Chinese anti-air system with Chinese missiles. France is pushing it's domestic weapons industry for ships, subs, and more. Turkey and China are pushing armed drone systems like the Turkish drones used in Ukraine right now. It's a frenzy as the world wakes up to the possibility of war in modern Europe or elsewhere. It all depends on what they want",

Not all soldiers are combat arms types. At least in the US Army, only about 30-35% are combat arms, the rest are support/logistics fobbits. The combat arms people tend to go down first, so as overall percentage losses increase, it disproportionately affects your killers, usually. At some point, combat power starts dropping logarithmically as casualties mount, leaving poorly trained trained troops for the defense if there are no reinforcements.",

Rather, a total failure from the very very top to the poor lowly privates on the ground.\n\nIt looks like the whole standard global military is stuck between times. Big expensive vehicles equal big costly targets. Armor is routinely out-paced by ammunitions. Many troops equal many mouths to feed, water, equip, treat medically, transport, etc. The longer this war goes on, the faster we're going to see today's combat and tactics evolve into the wars we'll be fighting in years to come",

Pretty much everything was overestimated.\n\nThey have a shit ton of tanks, but it turns out they are almost all poorly maintained and can't do shit. Same with their other vehicles.  Before now it was just \"look at all the equipment they have!\" But now we know much of that equipment is worthless. \n\nTheir training was vastly overestimated.  It was assumed their soldiers knew how to fight, but it turns out very few do.  They have a small number who know what to do in a fight, but for the majority their training is so poor that once the Ukrainians (who have excellent training) were able to fight back, the Russians crumble.  This is another instance where their massive numbers were seen as something to fear, but it's not so scary when most of them can't do shit.\n\nAnd like you said, definitely their tactics as well.  Their supply lines can barely hold when only a couple hundred kilometers long, and seem to have failed at many points.  We all assumed they could do the basic military things like keep their soldiers supplied with food, ammo, and fuel.  But they couldn't.\n\nIf Russia was able to do things that are expected of a \"regular\" military, things might be very different in Ukraine.  Not saying they would have won by now, or would win, just that Ukraine would be dealing with much more losses than they are now.\n\nAlso, the ability of the Ukrainian military was greatly underestimated.  It was assumed that things would go much like they did when Russia took Crimea.  But that Ukrainian military and the current one are worlds apart.  They have been receiving supplies from many countries, and training from some of the best trained militaries in the world.\n\nIn the end, I'm so glad that everyone was so wrong about how things would turn out.",

I believe this to be true because I can't see Putin willingly starting a prolonged war like this at the tail end of a global pandemic. The only scenario that makes sense is that he thought this would be Crimea 2.0 and that two weeks would be enough to start, consolidate and end this war.\n\nSo yea, I think it's fair to say Russia is struggling. They knew what the global repercussion would be and they thought they could endure if for two weeks but now (and I'm more-or-less guessing now) their economy is in shambles, his popularity is at an all-time low externally and internally and the \"sure fire\" war is now looking more and more like a publicly-humiliating loss with every day.\n\nAnd it's terrifying. Because what does Putin have to lose now? The more the situation becomes a complete mockery, the more it makes sense, ever so slightly, for desperate options to start becoming viable. Russian military is already bordering Finland now, which would almost certainly lead to all-out war in Europe (at least!) should it become an active conflict. What's next? Nukes?!\n\nI can only hope the Russian oligarchs realize Putin is leading them to certain doom. At this point, should \"world war\" start, not even North Korea or China would want to be on Russia's losing side - they have nothing to gain by it. Russia can't even capture Ukraine, a pitiful country when it comes to military defence and from there they will be fighting a defensive war for their own territory which no one has much to gain by helping them retain at this point - certainly not worth openly declaring war against the EU and NATO over!\n\nWouldn't be surprised if Putin suicides himself twice to the back of the head any day now to save what is left of Russia in the mid-term - economically, politically, militarily and sovereignty-wise. Sorry comrade but you live by the sword, you die by the sword.",

When America invaded Afghanistan, we claimed the entire country in 2 months.  We\u2019re almost 2 months in to Ukraine and Russia certainly hasn\u2019t kept to that timeline.  We in the west also put a great deal of importance on minimizing our own casualties.  Russia has lost more soldiers in the last month that the US did in 20 years in Afghanistan.  On the other hand, we lost that same number of people in a matter of hours on D-day, and called it acceptable losses.  Different time, different war, and different tactics.  What\u2019s acceptable is subjective.\n\nSo it\u2019s easy as an American armchair general to look at Ukraine and conclude that something has gone catastrophically wrong for Russia.  And if Russia was attempting to use American-style tactics, that would be a fair assessment.  But are they?  That\u2019s the question.  \n\nThey\u2019ve suffered a number of casualties, but is that number unacceptably high to Russia?  Or is that what they expected?  They certainly made a push to Kyiv which was stopped cold and eventually pulled back.  That an objective win for Ukraine!  But was that Russia\u2019s main thrust or just a secondary objective?  In the meantime in the East and south of the country, they have taken and held territory and have settled into a war of attrition.  The west would never intentionally fight a war of attrition because it\u2019s so costly, but what if that was Russia\u2019s plan all along?  What if they knew all along this was going to be a long and costly slog, lasting months or years, and they are prepared to see it through?\n\nI want to see Ukraine prevail as much as the rest of the free world.  But OP\u2019s instinct to avoid being overly optimistic is a good one.  If Putin has no upper limit to how many people he\u2019s willing to sacrifice, or how much damage he does to Russia economy, a victory for Russia is still very possible.  NATO and allied countries are doing what they can militarily and economically without triggering WWIII or crippling our own economies.  We need to keep pushing those limits as much as we dare to give Ukraine the best odds possible, but even then they are still the underdog in this fight.",

But Russia was one of the most feared militaries on the planet and Ukraine barely even a blip on the regional map, and Ukraine fought them to a standstill well short of Russia's objectives.\n\nThat's not to say Russia can't get anything out of this war or will have entirely failed - but thus far they've tanked their economy and killed 5-10k of their own men, shattered their military reputation on the world stage, united NATO and the EU, started Germany on a re-militarization path, pushed Finland and Sweden into NATO's hands, and is still nowhere near to even achieving their \"fallback\" goals of taking the entirety of Donbas.\n\nIt's possible that Russia could have a successful offensive in the east and take the rest of Donbas and secure Mariupol (which looks inevitable), on top of the canal supplying Crimea's water which has already been captured. You could consider that Russia has, at that point, achieved enough objectives to be worth the invasion - but the cost for that has been huge and it's hard to argue that it's been worthwhile\n\nThe only thing Russia has *really* achieved is to secure the Crimean water supply, and to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO... but that was already off the table since 2014, all Russia had to do was continue quietly supporting the existing war in Donbas and Ukraine was going to stay out of NATO anyway",

Inter-reporter corroboration is important here.\nSo if you are worried about bias in local news, try checking the general consensus using foreign news.\n\nI.e. what are Japanese news outlets saying about the event?\nBritish?\nAustralian?\nFinnish?\nGerman?\n\nEtc etc.\nIn the Ukraine-Russian conflict they all generally say the same thing, despite differing allegiances (.e.g UK, AUS, NZ, US, CAN are part of the 5 eyes intelligence network, which is why I've included countries outside that network).\n\nTo the people that decry 'Mainstream news is lying to you' then why do news of other countries say the same thing?  For these conspiracy theorists, they think the entire world is lying to them.  And speaking as a project manager, that is an insane effort to pull off.\n\nSo check multiple sources (of different countries, multiple glorified blogs don't count cause it only costs $5/yr to spin up those), learn to recognize logical fallacies and these two things should help you better recognize what is propaganda and what isn't.",

And also that the Windsors are one of these reptilian bloodlines. Christine also knew about the reptile Satanic rituals, the sexual rites and the widespread sacrifice of children. She said it is the pure essence of the pre-pubescent the reptiles want. \u201cIf you looked at where all the castles are built and where there are a lot of street children in the Third World, they\u2019re galloping it at the moment. They\u2019re pulling the kids in en masse now.\u201d She said the reptiles want the children\u2019s life essence because they can\u2019t continue to manifest without that pure energy. \u201cThe contaminated essence of us adults is not worth anything to them\u201d, she said. \u201cAll the rituals, the knives, and sodomy, its that easy for these people to snatch a piece of your soul.\u201d Christine also spoke about the sex rituals and orgies involving the Windsors. The very word orgy comes from the Greek, orgia, meaning \u2018secret worship\u2019 and relates to the sexual rites of the ancient mystery religions.\u201d - Icke, David.

You could probably find counter examples, but in most western nations and beyond there are a very small number of companies controlling the overwhelming majority of media channels and are subsequently biased in favor of the interests of their ruling class owners.

The Kremlin failed to take Kiev and are redistributing to the Donbas region and at the same time this supports their (empty) claim of \"liberating\" Ukraine of \"neonazis\". \n\nThere's also the whole logistical malarkey where they were unable to resupply or maintain upkeep adequately in the long term due to their expectation of taking Ukraine in under a week. \n\nUkraine are also continuously receiving assistance in the form of weapons and war vehicles from wealthy nations of the west while a lot of the Russian military is using decades old equipment. \n\nIn the end there's a million factors but you're absolutely right that there's at least some bias on either side. \n\nAs far as I'm aware, most of, or maybe some of the Russian population really does think that Ukraine is run by a Nazi entity which means they think they are indeed rescuing Ukraine but also, maybe we are just told that by our media.

There are wars that are fought to completely annihilate your enemy and salt the earth in order to protect your sovereignty and prevent your enemy from ever recovering, but that\u2019s not the case here and it\u2019s why their threat of nuclear weapons is completely idiotic.

Oh, and that\u2019s if you even manage to launch one without triggering a retaliatory response from other nearby nuclear powers. I want to say Putin won\u2019t do this, but I wouldn\u2019t have guessed he\u2019d full-on invade Ukraine in the first place, so who the fuck knows anymore.",

            "comment": "Good question.  Here's my understanding so far:\n\nRussia has a logistics issue.  They have a lot of tanks and mechanized vehicles but they can't get the supplies to them.  Reason is they rely heavily on their rail network which the closest one, in the beginning of the war, was in Belarus at the border of Ukraine.  A few weeks ago, the Ukrainians and some Belarus defectors blew up the rail line at the Russian border which caused the Russian supply lines to fall back even further.\n\nRussia was prepared for a 7ish day war.  Steam roll in there, knock out the capital and retake the country.  That didn't happen due to fierce resistance and now they're facing that supply chain issue which continually gets worse the longer this goes on.\n\nThe whole thing is very interesting in that Russia believes NATO to be an aggressor and an enemy.  Russia wants a buffer zone between themselves and NATO.  Geographically, the border of Ukraine and Russia is sparse farmland with no natural barriers.  If Russia were to push it's borders further west, then they have geographic barriers like mountains.  Strategically, this makes sense to give them a buffer against, what they perceive, is a NATO invasion.\n\nCrimea was taken in 2014.  Crimea has a lot of oil reserves off the coast.  This was also a foothold into Ukraine.  The one thing that Crimea doesn't have is a lot of fresh water.  They have one river that runs thru Ukraine and thru the area which Ukraine dammed off in their territory.  This caused Russia to have to import water for 2.1M people during a time where record breaking heatwaves were occurring.  Logistically, this was a nightmare for Russia as they had to build infrastructure (Bridges) and use trucks to get fresh water into Crimea and continue their oil exploitation.\n\nThere are vast oil reserves off the coast of Ukraine and Crimea.  If Russia can just capture the coastal areas and unblock the dam then they can land-lock Ukraine and cause economic and supply chain issues into Ukraine.  This would force the Ukraine to the bargaining table and possibly force them under the Russian umbrella.\n\nIf you look closely at the [battle map](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) and whats going on, you can see where Russia has pushed themselves along the coast lines to make the above possible.  I don't know specifically where the Dam in the Ukraine is located, but at one point during the beginning Russia had done a spearhead attack directly up that river.\n\nSo, it's a \"Win\" for Russia if they can unblock that dam and if they can capture the coast.  It's a bigger \"Win\" for Russia if they take the entire country.  The longer this drags on though, the worse it's going to get.\n\nThe West has evolved in Warfare (Debatable, but hear me out).  We don't carpet bomb cities anymore.  We don't indiscriminately gas civilian population centers.  Russia doesn't care about this and will carpet bomb as they see fit.  The longer this goes on the more of a chance to see Gas attacks on civilians and who knows what's next after that.\n\nBack on point, to answer your question:  Yes, propaganda on both sides.  However, the battle map is really what to keep an eye on with those points above in mind.  The atrocities are horrible and I hope this will end soon.  If Putin can get those above goals, he will most likely call it quits even if he doesn't take the country itself.",

            "comment": "It seems like Russia is having an issue of occupying Ukraine. But they seem to be destroying the country just fine. It is hard to keep an army in a country, isn't hard to drop bomb after bomb and flatten it. Seems like they will do what they did in 2014, occupy a very small part close to their border where they dont have to spread themselves thin and keep and overarching threat of another full invasion to keep Ukraine from joining NATO.",

            "comment": "Having worked off and on with Russia, Ukraine, and a few other FSU states over the last 30 years, as well as being a little bit of a history buff, Russia has a history of using a meat grinder approach to war.  They always have.  Most of the soldiers in Russia's military are 19 and 20 year old kids who don't wanna be there and many are minorities (there are over 100 different ethnic groups in Russia).  The Ukrainians and Russians have intermarried for a thousand years.  So many of them are family.  The story of the common Russian person over the centuries is one of struggle, oppression, and abuse.  Putin is following the same path as the Soviet Leaders before him and the Czars as well.  The Russian \"peasants\" are expendable.  Is there propaganda on both sides?  To varying degrees, of course.  However, despots like Putin and the ilk before him take propaganda to an entirely different level.",

    "postText": "Call me dumb but I have a serious fear of bugs ( especially the colorful spotted ones), last summer our area got infested by spotted lantern flies that are literally everywhere in the city. I\u2019ve done my duo diligent to squash them but feels hopeless based on how many there are . This year I\u2019ve dreaded summer which is usually my favorite season. According to internet they\u2019ve already starting to show up. \n\nDo spotted lanterns fly ever leave an area or is my only hope this point to move to a place that never gets warm? Is there anyway to get rid of them in mass ?",

They have a massive swarm.\n\nBut then following years they have WAY lower numbers because people recognize them and actively kill/prevent them, and the local conservation/environment department actively kills them too.\n\nThat\u2019s been my experience anyways, the first year they were literally everywhere, one every 25 steps, sometimes hundreds in one spot. But now they\u2019re much rarer.",

When I was young, I was going to Europe for a year on some work permit. The summer before, I thought: hey, what is the employer that is known everywhere and will be a plus for my job hunt in Europe? Answer: McDonald's.\n\nI got several job offers solely based on having worked at McDonald's. And I kept it on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for years because working at McDonald's is hard.\n\nOne of the places that usually always is hiring people are internet providers (Comcast, Verizon, Orange or O2 in the UK, ect). If you can last a little while there, you will be golden. They often have more senior titles for people lasting more than a year. Not the best job, but it will give you a foot in the door.\n\nAnother strategy is looking for small non-profit in your city. They are always looking for volunteers (or free services) and maybe you can help them. That is a great skill to have.

Think about how you would want to be treated if you were in the other person's situation. Treat them nicer than that.\n2. Pay attention to your body language when you interact with other people. Smile as appropriate, stand up straight, and look the other person in the eyes. If looking in their eyes makes you uncomfortable, at least look at their face.\n3. Pay attention to the other person's body language. For example, if they're looking away, they're probably disinterested or uncomfortable. \n4. Listen to what they say. Don't open your mouth until they're done talking, and try not to fidget or make hand motions that imply you're trying to interject.\n5. Not everything you're thinking needs to be said. Keep your sentences short and simple. Don't add contrivances, overly formal language, or extraneous details that will make your speech unnatural or awkward.\n\nI want to stress #5 a lot, because it's a really common problem for people who want to engage in the conversation or say something funny but aren't socially well-adjusted. Don't be that guy who always has to randomly blurt something out.",

Are you going to try and solve a multivariable differential equation just to calculate if they are worth it in the long term? NO! Get rid of them so you don't loose work and talent in the rest of the company. \n\nThis has been scientifically proven I am pretty sure lol",

The young women all despised and avoided him for harassment reasons. There was one older woman on the team, who happened to be our best tech talent, who had one foot out the door because she hated working with him. Fortunately management came to their senses and fired him and promoted her into his position before she left, but we definitely lost younger talent because of him (both men who thought he was a dick and women who thought he was a creep).",

So I did ask when I needed help, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m really busy, this is what we\u2019re paying you for, I kinda need you to just do it\u201d. Then when I just didn\u2019t ask him next time and the issue got bigger than it needed to be, he just yelled at us again about not communicating. Fuck that guy, I took a better job and am now working at one of his biggest clients. \n\nBeing a good boss means you need to recognize and build up your team\u2019s weaknesses, even if the weakness is that they need to ask dumb questions multiple times. Pretty much every new grad I\u2019ve taught I had the \u201cwe\u2019ve had this chat already\u201d thought, but kept it to myself. Then one day they just kinda piece it all together and they\u2019re a competent employee. Training takes a lot of time and it might bite you if they leave but you need to recognize that things can sometimes take months / years to develop. If you assume someone is going to fail and treat them like a failure, you\u2019re getting exactly what you are wishing for when they fail (or more likely, quit).",

His dad had the system of dropping it off and then them dropping 10% profit and the stuff needed for the next batch off outside his place. They just kept the system and never felt the need to bug him as long as he made his deliveries. I think that probably is the closest I can think of to a job with no interacting with other people.

We were pretty much always hiring so we had lots of people asking to apply. I remember one time when I was working, it was pretty busy and we were low on staff (it was just me, my manager, and the assistant manager) and a woman came in for her interview. Obviously with a rush of orders, we had to focus on getting them done so our assistant manager asked her to wait a little bit since the next shift was coming in soon. She agreed but was being extremely impatient and rude towards us and constantly asking when he\u2019d be ready when she could see we were short staffed and trying to just do our job. She didn\u2019t realize my manager was working the floor with us and when my assistant manager was ready to do the interview, my manager just shook her head no at him, because she didn\u2019t want to hire the woman at all because of how she acted while he was gone, regardless of how she would\u2019ve interviewed.",

There are employees in tech in our district that have been there since '93 and do not know the difference between a transistor and a microwave tube and couldn't define what a domain name server is if their life depended on it. They'll probably be there long after I'm gone.  \n\nSoooooooooo much of IT is taking concepts and regulations and turning it into regular humanspeak in a polite and informative manner. Explain to a six year old that them getting mad and punching their computer screen just cost their parents a lot of money and isn't okay without making them cry. Go into a principals office and reboot their phone while they're waiting for a call from the board members and have two very pissed off parents in their room.  \n\nI get frustrated all the time by my users lack of technical knowledge. Then I remember that's why I have a decent job with good benefits making a livable wage and go back to looking at dumb memes on my phone until the rage passes.  \n\nIt legitimately doesn't matter at all what you know if you're working in the people-facing side of IT. Don't be an asshole, don't ever assume anyone knows anything until proven otherwise, and understand things well enough to explain them simply enough that even a child could grasp them. If you can nail the first two the last one doesn't matter.  \n\nSource - built my first computer at six, been in IT in various capacities professionally for about six years now, still the family IT guy.",

All pharmacists must pass the same board exams before they can practice, so there is a base level of proficiency that we all share. This makes personality and interpersonal skills more important. On the other hand, in my state there is no minimum level of education or training for pharmacy technicians (beyond a high-school diploma). I have met many techs who are extremely skilled at their jobs, and as a result are able to get away with being difficult to work with.\n\nNow if you're asking what I personally look for in coworkers, it's a balance of both personality and proficiency. While this may seem like a cop-out answer, it's true. I've worked with some incredibly kind pharmacists who will stop everything they are doing and spend long periods of time (sometimes 20+ minutes) just talking to a patient, resulting in me having to do the work of two pharmacists by myself which can be frustrating. I've also worked with technicians who can fill a hundred scripts in under an hour, but later I'll have to deal with patient complaints because the tech was being rude. It's important to find a balance.",

The manager was a total idiot but he knew how to be nice and throw down the corporate speak so everyone thought he was nice and doing stuff. In reality he'd show up at 9, leave at 3, and bitch that he didn't have enough time to do things every day. He was so bad he didn't want me asking him questions because it disturbed him when he was supposed to be training me. The last straw was when another developer did some seriously unsafe stuff and he got mad at me for finding it during a code review, probably because he now had to do more work.\n\nMediocre but nice is fine if someone works in a position that's not super important or mainly client facing. If the position is technical or people rely on the person having a low skilled employee on the team can bring the entire team down quickly or cause serious problems, especially if they think that they're better than they are. I personally would rather work with someone who I can trust to do the right thing even if they're a bit of a dick over someone who's nice then blows up the code base.",

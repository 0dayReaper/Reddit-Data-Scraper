The idea of taking the German-derived hamburger, combining it with the Belgian-derived \"french fry\", and then standardizing the process to get a consistent product nationwide (and worldwide)...is American. Regardless of whether that's a good thing, the question is whether or not \"American\" is an ethnicity. \n\nI hadn't thought of it that way before, but yeah. If you consider \"American\" an ethnicity, then yes. McDonald's, by that standard, would be \"ethnic food\". \n\nThanks for a thought provoking question.",

That and KFC are like the Panda Express of Chinese food outside the US. \n\nHowever, I feel like there are better examples of \"ethnic American\" food than McDonald's and you can find it in not America. \n\nIt feels wrong to say it is ethnic American but I do think a lot of the world discover Ethnic American food though McDonald's.\n\nIf you are in the US however, if you call McDonald's ethnic American, then you are also calling other burger joints and steakhouses ethnic American. Every food is ethnic something when you get down to it. It is a very silly distinction to make if you are living in that country. Even the ethnic food of that country is inflicted by that country.",

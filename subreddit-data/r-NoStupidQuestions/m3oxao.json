They shoot a laser beam at such an angle into your windshield that it normally would be reflected by the inside of the glass.\n\nIf a drop is on the glass, the laser beam will not be reflected by the glasses surface but travel through the droplet and escape.\n\nAdd more beams, let them zig-zag inside the glass, sense how much of them stays inside and then you know how much water is on the glass.",

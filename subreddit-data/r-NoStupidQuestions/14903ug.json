    "postText": "I'm just weirded out by the concept. It seems there there are a ton of people who share the same belief that their voice sounds worse in a recording. So...what exactly are the musicans/singers listening to? Do they also think their songs sound horrible, but they just go along with it? Or do they have some training to \"match\" their real voice to their recording voice. It must mean that singers hear themselves sing in a different voice, which I find fascinating.",

But singers generally know how their voice sounds to others, and *probably* don't hate their voice because they've gotten used to hearing it and have trained it extensively.",

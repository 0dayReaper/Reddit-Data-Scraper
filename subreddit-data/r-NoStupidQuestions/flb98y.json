The price-gougers need to be held accountable.\n\nMeanwhile, if you're nuts enough to buy five bottles at once at $70 a pop, yeah, that's on you.\n\nSome friends and I brainstormed a partial solution to this problem. Want to stock up? Okay. The price doubles for every additional unit you buy.\n\nOne pack of TP? $10 (or whatever, arbitrary amount is arbitrary). Second pack? Your total is now $20. Three packs? $40. Six packs? $320. Stores get to overcharge idiot hoarders, fewer people are dumb enough to hoard, and more supplies are available to the rest of us.\n\n(Of course, this wouldn't really work outside of membership-only stores without some type of rationing system, because there's no easy way way to stop someone from just... going through the checkout multiple times. But it's fun to dream sometimes. =| )",

Japan is the 2nd highest producer per capita and they didn't even make your list. The only context this is true is if you're talking about lab-only research and judge a country based on the number of research papers produced per capita (and not per researcher). But that is about 1% of the total cost of developing a drug for the pharmaceutical market.  \n\nEDIT: Sorry, the source listed next is apparently behind a paywall, it's working for some people and not others.

Many new drugs developed are very minor modifications of existing drugs developed more or less for the sole purpose of extending patents. And it seems to me that the US wouldn't have relatively poor health outcomes across the board (excepting the rich ruling class) if there was actually an incredible advantage with this system. \n\nEven granting all of that, I think what you're saying is pretty foolish and misses the point that scientists are the ones actually doing the innovation, not corporate boards as in some Ayn Rand style fantasy world. All the innovation could still happen with the innovators (again, the actual scientists not blood sucking CEOs) receiving public funding at whatever amount they already do and simply cutting out unnecessary profiteering.",

They patent a chemical once it has been formulated and shows any signs of doing something. It takes on average 10 years and $2.6 billion to bring a new drug to market. So you have kissed half your patent good bye. And if it's a drug that a relatively small portion of the population needs, then they have a small market sector. And that is for successful drugs.\n\nLet's say it costs $2.6 billion for a drug (not counting the countless other failed projects now costing them money) and 10 years without being able to sell it. So now they have 10 years left, or approximately 100 months (120 to be exact yes). So they have to recoup 26 million for month to BREAK EVEN if EVERY drug they make goes to market. So if 100k people can use the drug, that is 260 a month it will cost. Double that if they have one failed drug per successful one. And once again that is before profit, and not accounting for time value of money.",

That's putting funding of research on a specific group towards research that may or may not help that group footing the bill.\n\nInstead I believe research should be provided by block grants from the tax payers. This way there is a higher chance that those needing the researched medicine are also the ones paying for the R&amp;D. Again, just my two cents.",

Either way insulin is a prime example of greed...if I remember correctly, the process of large scale insulin production was developed in Canada by a doctor. He won the noble prize and secured a patent for it ONLY for the purpose that no one else could monopolize on the discovery for financial gains. He sold the patent to a University in Toronto for only a dollar. Somehow it got to the US and is now being used to essentially up charge patients that depend on it for their lives...it\u2019s kind of ridiculous.",

The smaller ones can spend up to 50% on R&amp;D. Compare that to the overall average for industries of 1.3%. Pharmaceutical companies spent $71.4 billion in R&amp;D in 2017.  Also, drug patents have a maximum of 20 years. After that, anyone can make the drug. Don't forget, the Companies pay the same to develop a drug that doesn't work or has unacceptable side affects as one that goes on sale.\n\nCompare that to some guys clearing out every store in their area of sanitizer and selling it online for profit during a crisis.\n\nI'm not saying pharmaceutical drugs aren't overpriced, but it is hardly an apples-to-apples comparison.",

There are generics and name-brand drugs available here at many times the price that you can get it in any other country. Are we subsidizing the rest of the world, or are we paying more because we have a system built to do so?\n- Lifesaving drugs that have been available for decades have increasing prices that outpace inflation. \n- Profits/Net income among these companies remain very high as a percent of revenues. This number outpaces that of manufacturing as a whole. \n- Accessibility. I have a good insurance program, and if you add up my premiums, the premiums my company pays for me, and my maximum cap, the total is under $10,000. Within this, my pharma costs for the vast majority of drugs remain at $9/script for a month supply. Someone with worse insurance - or no insurance doesn't have that accessibility, that protection, and their annual health care costs mar far exceed my absolute cap of $10,000. \n\nNot all the blame is placed strictly on pharma. Some people blame the FDA and regulation (more right wing). Some people blame corporate greed and a capitalist system (left wing). I do think that more than an insignificant amount of blame should be placed on pharma companies because they control something valuable to the public with life-or-death utility, and they profit off of it. More profit means higher risk of inaccessibility, which means people likely died as a result of seeking such a high profit.",

Why else would they waist years of research and millions of dollars to develop these drugs? On the other hand, you have to make these drugs as cheap as possible to save as many lives as you can.

            "comment": "Edit 1: Source, I\u2019m a professional economist\n\nThere\u2019s two answers to your questions. \n\nThe first is that \u201cprice gouging\u201d is more of a subjective term than an objective term. People will throw around the term price gouging when they feel that someone is charging an unreasonable price. Objectively, the \u201ccorrect price\u201d is any price in a range of prices. The lowest possible price is the lowest price what a seller is willing to sell for, and the highest price is the maximum willingness to pay by the consumer. Arguably and controversially, prices for hand sanitizer should be higher because aggregate willingness to pay for hand sanitizer has increased. This is strictly the economics of the situation. Obviously, economics does not capture everything that is going on and ethics can help us fill the gaps. That ethical consideration, \u201ceven if economics says the price should be $X, morals tell us it should be lower\u201d is why people call it \u201cprice gouging.\u201d And, clearly, pharmaceuticals are held to a different standard. But, there seems to be no objective moral facts, so what the ethical thing to do in the two situations could be different and depend on context, social pressures, expectations, current standards, etc. \n\nThe second answer is that there is a very good reason why pharmaceutical companies charge huge markups in many drugs. Basically, these companies spend millions, sometimes billions, of dollars and many years on research and development us new drugs. Once they have spent this huge fixed cost, they can often manufacture the drug for quite cheap. However, they need to recoup the costs of R&amp;D. Imagine if you spent that much time and money on something and weren\u2019t compensated for it (see r/choosingbeggars for how, correctly, upset people get when they don\u2019t get paid $20 for their work). So, typically drug companies are given patents where they basically have a monopoly over that drug for a few decades. The idea is that they can recoup their costs and make a fair profit. Once the patent expires, the drug can be made by anyone and prices tend to fall quite rapidly. If we didn\u2019t allow companies to sell at such a high markup for a short time, a lot less drugs would be developed. Now we could argue that pharmaceutical companies out to discover drugs out of the goodness of their hearts. But be honest with yourself, do you really think that would work? Of course not. \n\nIn short, there is a disconnect between how we think people ought to act and how they actually do. Moreover, there\u2019s different ethical standards people hold given societal pressures, social norms, and context of the situation. Lastly, we know there plate good reasons for pharmaceutical pricing, which is why few people get as upset. \n\nTLDR - price gouging is subjective. Drug researchers and companies gotta get paid for their work. Ethics is hard",

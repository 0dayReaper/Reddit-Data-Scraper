He claims to be out of the country and needs me to mobile deposit a check as I need funds to complete certain tasks. I\u2019m super skeptical that this is legit. He said a handful of hours ago that he would email me a valid check to deposit. What are some telltale signs of a false check?",

You deposit the check, then he has you spend the money on gift cards or something like that for him. Then, a couple days later, the check bounces, and he disappears. Now you're out the money you spent. It's a classic scam.",

You are out the money. \n\nIt's a common scam. What they do is have say 10 checking accounts. They deposit a bad check into account 1 then deposit a check from account 1 into account 2 then from account 2 to 3 and so on. They give you a check from the last account. All the checks are bad.  It takes a while for all the checks to clear and the banks to catch up. They get you to give them cash, wire cash or give them a check out of your personal account before their check bounces.",

Also the bank may close your account. Destroy the check and block the person.",

    "postText": "\nI would post this on r/advice, but it isn\u2019t showing up and this is really the only place I could post.\n\nI wanna hang out with my friends, but I don\u2019t know if some of them would even want to. Most of them never text me. I know many of them are busy, but I see many of them active on social media and many are introverts. \n\nThere are two in particular, who are guys, who I don\u2019t know if they would even want to hang out with me. \n\u2022One gives me mixed signals (when I texted them once they were a dry texter, but has tried to talk me to me in class a lot). They did answer when I asked when they were free and said they were probably free on the weekend, but asked, \u201cwhy?\u201d Recently, they sent me a picture of them in, what I assume to be, their car so they were going somewhere, but I do not know where. Makes me think they thought I was asking them on a date.\n\u2022The other mentioned hanging out with their other friends (who are guys) and maybe making a group chat with them. They didn\u2019t mention hanging out with me, but they did ask me what I did and plan on doing for the summer.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is just a one sided friendship with both of them or what.",

My parents always booked non-smoking when we were going on vacation, but that just meant the smoke was a little staler when it got to your seat, which was sometimes 2-3 feet from the smoking section. The first thing we always did after a flight and upon checking into the hotel was take a shower and wash our hair (my sister and I always had long hair that tended to hold that smoke smell). It's weird, I feel like even though it was annoying, we tolerated the smell much better then than now. Even the slightest cigarette smoke now and I'm totally grossed out, whereas in the past, when smoking was the norm, it didn't seem that bad.",

I imagine cigarette smoke was the same. \n\nAlso, there used to be slightly less toxic crap in cigarettes, so maybe it wasn't as bad back then.",

I was lucky enough to have been brought up in a smoke-free home, so I even though I was used to smoky environments, I didn't like them! This made me quicker to be outspoken about them than someone that grew up with passive parents.\n\nRestaurants didn't all of a sudden start having smoking/non-smoking sections once there was a law. Plenty of them had them and advertised them many, many years before that - even when I was a kid and I'm almost 60 now. My family often would make sure we could get a table far away from the smoking section before choosing where to go out to eat.\n\nI worked in radio, so mostly our studios were tiny rooms that absolutely reeked from almost 24/7 smokers. The equipment was all stained a slight yellow/brown color. Every once in a while, some engineers, after cleaning everything, would threaten to make the studio non-smoking because of all the gunk all over the equipment! Many actually followed though on this before offices went non-smoking.",

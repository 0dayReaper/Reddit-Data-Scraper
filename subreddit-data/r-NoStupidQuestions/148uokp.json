            "comment": "I haven\u2019t been there for awhile, but Yellowstone is huge\u2014it\u2019s like the size of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined. The Grand Loop road is 142 miles long and takes about 7 hours to drive. When I was there all the roads were two-lane and the speed limit was 15 mph. There are hotels within the park, but it\u2019s pretty popular and I\u2019m not sure about availability. Depending on direction, the nearest towns are 50-100 miles away. There is no public transportation available in the park itself. There are a number tour companies that service the park and have tours to different areas. I don\u2019t know where those tours originate. \n\nIf you are on your own, there is an entrance fee to the park, but not to any other areas. Most people go to see Old Faithful and the surrounding geyser area. I have been there twice, but both were short trips and those were the only places I had time to visit. From what I have heard, there are much more scenic areas more off the main tourist path. \n\nYellowstone is big, it\u2019s been around a long time, and it is very popular. Because of it\u2019s size and location, it takes some planning to visit. But there is tons of information easily available online. I would start with the US Forest Service website. Or just google things like \u201cYellowstone park tours\u201d or \u201cYellowstone park lodging\u201d or \u201cwhat to see in one day at Yellowstone\u201d and follow the links.",

This is why aircraft commonly have what's called a service ceiling, it's the highest it can fly.",

            "comment": "Pilots measure where they are in terms of *altitude*, measured by radar, air pressure, and GPS. If a plane were following a perfectly straight-line path, the pilots would notice their altitude increasing, and would adjust the plane's control surfaces to point the nose down slightly, so that it maintains a constant altitude. Over a long enough distance, that flight path would look like a gentle curve matching the Earth's curvature.\n\nBesides, planes don't automatically fly in a perfectly straight line if the controls are left untouched. Pilots have to make lots of minor corrections to the plane's direction, from things like turbulence, air density, thrust symmetry, etc.",

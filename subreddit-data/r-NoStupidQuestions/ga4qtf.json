I tried to go to Wal-Mart the other day,  because I needed some stuff I couldn't find of the pickup/ delivery selections.  It was such a mistake! Maybe 1 in 5 people were wearing a mask.  The carts aren't being disinfected between customers. Very few people were following the arrows on the floor.  I gently pointed that out to several people. Very few people were making any effort to distance themselves from others.  One lady coughed several times WITHOUT EVEN COVERING HER MOUTH.  I was appalled,  grabbed the couple of things I really needed,  and got the hell out of there. I will never be going into Wal-Mart again.  Publix is making much more of an effort,  so I'll pay more to shop there from now on.",

The East Coast drivers are required to wear masks and gloves in the shipper/receiver at more locations than we are.\n\nPretty much nowhere is requiring it, that I've been to, but distancing measures are set.\n\nI was the first that I saw to wear gloves and mask into anywhere. I now bring a small spary bottle of isopropyl and my own pen, as gloves are running low. I keep a hand washing station on my passenger side of the truck. Had a 5 gallon, spigoted camping container before all this and it has come in handy.\n\nOver the last 6 weeks, I've seen a huge roller coaster of attitudes and practices. As of two weeks ago, more drivers, than not, were taking things more seriously, but there were always those old codgers that's didn't care and acted like everyone was losing their minds. This week, I've noticed a huge shift. It's like everyone thinks it's over. I'm very disheartened, but am not changing any practice of cleaning my truck with diluted bleach, N99 mask wearing (had some left over from constant smoke due to fires near where we live) and incessant hand washing and sterilizing. \n\nI feel like this recent attitude will be the new norm. All the talk of opening up Southern states has people on the West coast thinking it's full steam ahead? Oh, also, traffic is about back to where it was, almost.",

(working in a nursery home) \nMy husband and I rode on the bus this morning and I had to remind him at least two times to please wear his mask correctly. He complained he couldn't read or see with the mask because his glasses got foggy. He had to wear it for about 45 minutes till he got to work and could take it off. I wear the damn thing the whole day. Stop complaining and just. do. it. -.-",

That was a damn nightmare- they had to empty out a section, squeeze all of the other shelves tighter together to fit all the stock on it, and put in the new floor for that section. Took more than a month. You could barely fit one cart down the aisles, let alone try to turn.",

Some of the people may be out for the first time and have no idea to look at the stickers on the floor. Stickers on the floor aren't new to grocery stores, so it's not like it's that obvious to people. Especially since they're not big arrows (in my experience). \n\nIf you're so anxious about getting sick, then the smart thing to do is to stay away from people and not confront them. The worst part out of all of this in the stores is the old fucks who just stand there considering what they're there for instead of writing a list before they go, or stand there on their phone blocking an entire aisle. All I want to do is get and out as fast a humanly possible. The less I'm around others, the better. Both for the virus and my general sanity.",

On my way out, I saw her leaning on the lotto cart picking numbers. It just seemed very silly and hypocritical of her",

It's one of the bulk stores so I was looking up (like at the aisle names) most of the time and I was trying to rush and get TF out. I did wear my mask and tried to not touch anything that I didn't take. But I'm probably *that* asshole",

You can tell they DGAF about anybody and they're just putting in the most empty weakest measures they can to try to keep the health department off their back.\n\nI really hope this whole thing eventually leads to a wildcat strike when the time is right.",

Or maybe it's more of a you-can't-tell-me-what-to-do. I don't know why we are so against following any type of new rule or guideline. Certainly there is some amount of perceived risk versus perceived reward. As in, \"if I just speed through the store and don't wait for aisles to clear, it's not like I'M going to get the Covid and I'm in a rush!\"\n\nBut really, I think a lot of people are just completely oblivious to the changes in policy, despite the signs everywhere and announcements over the PA. Seriously, tons of the comments are pointing that out. My coworkers have said the same. People don't pay attention to the world around them.",

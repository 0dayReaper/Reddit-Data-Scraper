            "comment": "Canadian here, who grew up on a farm. \n\nCanadian bacon is a style of back bacon, originating in the US. It is typically smoked. It is similar to ham, but not the same. As u/sterlingphoenix pointed out, ham comes from the thigh/rump, and Canadian bacon comes from the back. However unlike what u/sterlingphoenix said, we don't talk about Canadian bacon. In fact we don't even call it Canadian bacon. Maybe they were making a fight club reference and I'm too dense to get it. \n\nAnyway, in Canada we have something called peameal bacon, which is similar, but not the same as Canadian bacon. It's back bacon, but then is rolled in cornmeal. The reason I bring this up is because this is probably the most Canadian style of bacon I've come across. So if there was a Canadian bacon, this would be it.",

            "comment": "It's definitely not \"due to low IQ\". IQ is a measure, it's not the cause of anything.\n\nBeing bad at following instructions probably will likely lower your IQ score a bit, compared to if you were good at it. IQ tests check for quite a variety of stuff (including memory, for example), so whatever makes you bad at following instruction is also likely to come up in the test at some point. But the tester is supposed to make sure you get the instructions right, otherwise that would be a big bias in the test (pretty common one for non-native speakers, for example. Obviously the tests have to be suited to the language).",

Can you elaborate?\n\n&gt; But the tester is supposed to make sure you get the instructions right, otherwise that would be a big bias in the test\n\nI don't have a problem comprehending the instructions. I have problems remembering them and remembering the correct order and the various details. From what I know about IQ tests they dont have detailed instructions and are pretty intuitive to understand.",

If you want to know if you have a problem, go see a psychologist, and let them decide which test is relevant (you'll need one to get a relevant IQ test anyway).

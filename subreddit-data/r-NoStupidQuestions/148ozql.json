So these ships can only bring a couple thousand soldiers with equipment at once and their rather small aircraft carrier can only field a couple dozen airplanes at the same time.\n\nSo the Mexican army could just defeat these small forces and then China would have to go back to put reinforcements on these ships and sail all the way back to Mexico for the next battle, while the bulk of China's forces would be in China, waiting to be shipped.\n\nSo simple logistics are preventing China from attacking Mexico. \n\nIt's the same in the other direction. If the US had the idea to physically invade China, they wouldn't be able to overcome the logistical problems. The US has perhaps 200 ships that can cross the Pacific which would give them a landing force of perhaps 20 thousand troops. But China would be defending with 2 million troops. \n\nThe US could perhaps gain a foothold for a day or two and go back to get reinforcements but by the time the reinforcements would be shipped to China, the foothold would be overwhelmed by superior numbers.\n\nLogistically, it just isn't feasible to invade a large country over an ocean.\n\nWhen the US attacked Iraq in 2003, they first stockpiled troops and equipment in the desert of Iraq's neighbor Kuwait for 6 months before invading over land.\n\nChina has no friendly country next to Mexico to stockpile troops in.",

                            "comment": "&gt;They don't? The United States seems to have had little issues with this in the past.\n\nThat's not normal. Relatively few countries have ever possessed the capability to cross an ocean and invade another continent. The US possesses the capability now. The British and French Empires did until a little after WW2. Imperial Japan did during WW2. Going further back, a few other European colonial empires could do it from the 16th to 19th centuries. The Mongols sort of attempted it twice and failed miserably. That's it in human history. Moving forward by land is considerably more common historically. Being a naval power is brutally expensive, and not for the faint of heart. \n\nTo do so requires a very large blue water navy, and an even larger military sealift capability to move troops and material. In addition, you'd need a network of overseas naval installations, or at the very least, a lot of agreements with foreign governments to use their ports. The US has had all of that in place since the 1890's. \n\nChina is in the beginning stages of building a military that might one day be capable of doing that. They bought a defunct Red Navy aircraft carrier from Russia, and built two more on their own. They have plans for more. They've begun to upgrade their military sealift capability, and have established their first military base outside of Asia(Djibouti). However crossing the Pacific, and invading North America is a capability that probably still eludes them by at least 20 years if not longer, and would require cooperation with others or conquest ahead of the attempt",

Even just NATO weapons flowing to Ukraine has stalled them.\n\nIf China tries to invade Mexico, they're going to have to do with with the entire US military shooting down every Chinese plane and sinking every Chinese ship it can find. We wouldn't just provide weapons to Mexico, we would be actively involved to prevent a hostile takeover of our neighbor.",

Especially from the Pacific. \n\nFor starters the distance is astronomical compared to a Land invasion, add in running supply lines and troop transport, and you have a recipe for a very difficult invasion attempt. It's why throughout human history there have been very few nations that ever attempted let alone succeeded in a sea borne invasion. Even Germany in WW2 was unable to successfully invade and occupy Britain due to the fact they had to attempt a Sea invasion compared to the rest of mainland Europe, which only required Land invasions.",

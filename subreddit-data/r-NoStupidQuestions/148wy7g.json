    "postText": "I keep getting this ad for a thing called a Chagacino\u2026 and it looks like actual barf. Supposedly it\u2019s a much healthier, much tastier alternative to frappucinos, but i don\u2019t know. They\u2019re really expensive and you have to order them online so it doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. So i\u2019m just curious to see what people who have tried it thought of it.",

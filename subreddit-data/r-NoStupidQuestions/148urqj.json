RCA wires connected to RCA to HMDI then connected to a HDMI to DVI adapter\n \n2. RCA to HMDI composite AV Adapter, connected to a HMDI to VGA adapter, then the VGA cable connected to the VGA adapter is connected to the monitor \n\n3. RCA to HDMI composite AV, then a HDMI cable connected to a HDMI to DVI adapter \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is there a simpler way? The ps2 is plugged in and turned on.",

I personally don\u2019t know and from what ive googled it seems like it wouldn\u2019t work in this case. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of getting PS2 component cables and then getting a VGA to component adapter. If you used component cables, then it may work for me.",

    "postText": "We are having a good laugh here. \"Mm\" is like \"Good point, I'm reflecting on what you just said\". \"Hmm\" is \"I'm thinking about how to respond\". \"Mmm\" is \"this is yummy\". \"Mmhmm\" is used in the affirmative to agree. Now I know the humming sound I make when I disagree, but how do you spell that? It's like a humming version of \"uh oh\" or \"nuh uh\" but people actually SAY those words, so what is the spelling for the hum?  \nAm I making sense? Its trivial for sure, but I am now on a linguistic mission!",

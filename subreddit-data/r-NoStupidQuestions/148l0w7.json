In most activities, it just gives you a leg up in the beginning, but then you are just on the same level as anybody that's been doing it for a bit.\n\nThe main thing I've found it good for is giving the impression that I'm intelligent, well-read and wise. All without being any of those things. Knowing the right jargon is usually enough for people to assume you are an expert.",

Gets people feeling good and more willing to be outgoing. In the right group, in limited quantities, it's a nice social lubricant.\n\nBut at worst, it makes people violent. It makes them melancholic and depressed. It makes them overly giddy and trusting. It makes them do stupid things they would never do sober. In the short term, it makes you feel nauseated and sick. In the long-term, it does horrible damage that can lead to permanent disability or death. At the same time, it's incredibly addictive.\n\nNo drug has ever caused as much collective pain in my life as alcohol has. It's a horrible drug.",

Living in Canada right now I think they've got it figured out pretty well, you can own almost any kind of rifles you want, but the barrels have to be (I think) at least 18.5\" and the maximum mag capacity is 5 rounds.\n\nNo real negative effect on sport shooting, hunting, property defense, or even just hobby collecting (pretty sure you can even have dummy 30 mags for the looks even though it's limited to 5 internally)...but it cuts way down on the availability of highly maneuverable rifles with high capacities that can be extremely deadly in CQB scenarios and can rack up mass casualties.",

When I can just drill out a Canadian magazine pin or 3d print them in my home (they're made of plastic in real life). Or just practice reloading drills - I can change a magazine in under a second, nobody's gonna stop me, especially if I bring a backup gun too.\n\nBarrel length is even more absurd. When you're talking about believing it has an impact because \"maneuvering\", that's going into the realm of make-believe solutions. Yeah theoretically if you made a law that said every gun has to have a 40kg weight chained to it it would make it hard to smuggle a gun into a theater and wave it around... until I just cut the weight off. Even then, obviously making guns weigh a ton each \"to prevent shootings\" should be recognized as well over the line of rational responses.\n\nFifteen minutes with a hacksaw kind of negates a barrel length law. And just saying \"it doesnt impact lawful people\" is silly of course it does. And of course it impacts collectors. \n\nThese laws are the gun version of ugly pictures on cigarettes. It makes anti-smokers feel good and smokers just go 'whatever's and buy them.\n\nThe #1 reason Canadians don't have lots of shootings is because Canadians don't have the aggressive rage culture that America does. There's a reason the stereotype of Canadians is polite and helpful.",

A legal gun in Canada has to be reloaded 5 times to discharge the number of rounds that a standard magazine holds in America. That is a whole lot of very high stress reload operations to successfully carry out while surrounded by a hundred screaming people who might be looking for their chance at you.\n\n&gt;When I can just drill out a Canadian magazine pin or 3d print them in my home\n\n&gt;Fifteen minutes with a hack saw kind of negates your barrel length law after all.\n\nPeople have rebutted all of those points to me before when discussing this, but at the end of the day all I can really ask you is this: why don't we have all these people 3D printing mags for sawed off barreled rifles and mowing people down in public buildings?\n\nEase of access is a very big deal, and a lot of mass shooters actually are NOT savvy people or particularly ambitious with their plans. It doesn't really take that big of a wrench to throw into their gears.\n\nAlso I think there's a bit of a chicken/egg situation too where gun regulations lead to a diminished gun culture. A problem kid in America is exposed to guns far more than a problem kid in Canada.\n\nThe Canadian kid might fantasize about getting revenge on bullies/cool kids by kicking their asses or vandalizing their shit since those are basically the options he has access to, and so that's what their minds would go to. The American kid these days is dreaming about all the others who have bought a gun or taken one from home, and marched through their school killing a couple dozen people for revenge.",

Back in the days of industrial monopolies, people like Andrew Carnegie felt very threatened by emerging markets for the many uses of the cannabis/hemp plant, but that wasn't the only reason it was brought down. Steel and lumber monopolies lobbied to outlaw hemp due to being threatened by the efficiency of the plant both in nutrients required, ease of growth, and manufacturing required to make it into the different types of products. Later, Harry J Anslinger, \"the father of the War on Drugs\" decided that the only way to boost his otherwise floundering Federal Bureau of Narcotics was to target cannabis. Together with sensationalist media mogul William Randolph Hearst, they ran an extreme smear campaign based on racist principles in a segregated America, renaming cannabis to \"marihuana\" and citing the drug use of the plant as eliciting violent and otherwise distasteful behaviors in minority populations. Hearst even went so far as to vocally support fascist ideals with Mussolini and Hitler, and praised European fascism for their efforts in performing ethnic cleansing by banning the drug. During the Great Depression, the new term of marihuana was used to spread fear and hatred among the white populations, and the foreign workers that had been so accepted during the years before the Depression were deported because of racial tensions when Anglos saw themselves competing with Mexican workers for the scarce jobs that were available. This caused part of the current mindset on immigrant workers. In addition to \"marihuana-crazed murderers\", \"reefer madness\" was also a smear term that was coined. \"Causing white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes\", and additionally preying on new women voters, film and media culture began to popularise the outcry against the \"negative\" effects of using the drug, attributing murder, suicide, robberies, armed holdups and more atrocious deeds to the drug. Eventually in Congress, the only person opposed to outlawing the plant itself was William Woodward, who factually stated that AMA doctors had no clue that the fear-inducing drug \"marijuana\" was the same as cannabis, which had been used for a century or so in a variety of medicinal applications. He predicted that banning the plant would lead to suffocating any more possible medical uses, but to no avail. October 1, 1937, the Marijuana Tax Act took effect in law, and the rest is history.\n\nhttps://fair.org/home/book-excerpt-the-origins-of-reefer-madness/\n\nThere are many other sites that tell the same story, and many people that wish to \"debunk a conspiracy theory\", however there is strong and compelling evidence to suggest that this is not a theory at all. Opposite, in fact, from the total lack of scientific and medical factual evidence presented to Congress by Anslinger in his efforts to ban the drug.",

These enzymes are consumed as a substance is metabolized, and constantly replenished by the liver - but it can only make them so fast.\n\nWith most substances, when the primary enzyme is used up, metabolism simply stops until more is produced. However, with Tylenol, there's a second enzyme that can also metabolize it.\n\nWhen this secondary enzyme starts metabolizing Tylenol, it produces toxic byproducts. These toxic byproducts will damage or kill the liver.\n\nThe threshold where you run out of the first enzyme, and metabolism starts with the second enzyme varies person to person, due to genetic factors, lifestyle (previous liver damage from drinking / fatty foods), and other drugs in your system also using these enzymes (like alcohol).\n\nSome people can take 8g of Tylenol and not have any liver damage. Others take 4g and a on the verge of liver failure. There are guidelines you can use to approximate a safe dose, but it's always just an estimate. ",

[Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-science-of-psychedelics-1525360091)\n\nThe New Science of Psychedelics\nRecent studies are finding that drugs such as LSD and psilocybin can help to alleviate depression, anxiety and addiction\u2014and may have profound things to teach us about how the mind works\nThe New Science of Psychedelics\n\nBy Michael Pollan\nMay 3, 2018 11:08 a.m. ET\n\nTo anyone who lived through the 1960s, the proposition that psychedelic drugs might have a positive contribution to make to our mental health must sound absurd. Along with hallucinogens like mescaline and psilocybin (that is, magic mushrooms), LSD was often blamed for bad trips that sent people to the psych ward. These drugs could make you crazy.\n\nSo how is it possible that, 50 years later, researchers working at institutions such as New York University, Johns Hopkins, UCLA and Imperial College in London are discovering that, when administered in a supportive therapeutic setting, psychedelics can actually make you sane? Or that they may have profound things to teach us about how the mind works, and why it sometimes fails to work?\n\nRecent trials of psilocybin, a close pharmacological cousin to LSD, have demonstrated that a single guided psychedelic session can alleviate depression when drugs like Prozac have failed; can help alcoholics and smokers to break the grip of a lifelong habit; and can help cancer patients deal with their \u201cexistential distress\u201d at the prospect of dying. At the same time, studies imaging the brains of people on psychedelics have opened a new window onto the study of consciousness, as well as the nature of the self and spiritual experience. The hoary \u201860s platitude that psychedelics would help unlock the secrets of consciousness may turn out not to be so preposterous after all.\n\nThe value of psychedelic therapy was first recognized nearly 70 years ago, only to be forgotten when what had been a promising era of research ran headlong into a nationwide moral panic about LSD, beginning around 1965. With a powerful assist from Timothy Leary, the flamboyant Harvard psychology professor, psychedelics had escaped the laboratory, falling into the eager arms of the counterculture. Yet in the decade before that there had been 1,000 published studies of LSD, involving 40,000 experimental subjects, and no fewer than six international conferences devoted to what many in the psychiatric community regarded as a wonder drug.\n\nTimothy Leary, pictured in 1967, urged others to \u2018turn on, tune in and drop out\u2019 with the help of LSD and other hallucinogens.\nTimothy Leary, pictured in 1967, urged others to \u2018turn on, tune in and drop out\u2019 with the help of LSD and other hallucinogens. \nCompared with other psychoactive compounds, these powerful and mysterious molecules were regarded as safe\u2014it\u2019s virtually impossible to overdose on a psychedelic\u2014and nonaddictive. Rats in a cage presented with a lever to administer drugs like cocaine and heroin will press it repeatedly, unto death. LSD? That lever they press only once.\n\nThis is not to say that \u201cbad trips\u201d don\u2019t happen; they do, especially when the drugs are used carelessly. People at risk for schizophrenia sometimes have psychotic breaks on psychedelics, and people surely do stupid things under the influence that can get them killed. But the more extreme claims about LSD\u2014that it scrambled users\u2019 chromosomes or induced them to stare at the sun until blind\u2014were debunked long ago.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that a small band of researchers began to unearth what an NYU psychiatrist describes as \u201ca buried body of knowledge\u201d about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. Perhaps the most promising application of the new drugs was in the treatment of alcoholism. Few people in Alcoholics Anonymous realize that Bill Wilson, the founder, first got sober after a mystical experience he had on a psychedelic administered to him in 1934, or that, in the 1950s, he sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce LSD therapy to AA.\n\nIn parts of Canada during the 1950s, psychedelic therapy became a standard treatment for alcoholism, and a 2012 meta-analysis of the six best-controlled trials of LSD therapy for alcohol addiction during that period found a \u201csignificant beneficial effect on alcohol misuse.\u201d Early studies of psychedelics for the treatment of several other indications, notably including depression and anxiety in cancer patients, also showed promise.\n\nThese first-wave studies were, by contemporary standards, poorly controlled. That\u2019s why many of the early experiments are now being reprised using more rigorous modern methods. The early results are preliminary but encouraging: A pilot study of psilocybin for alcohol dependence conducted at the University of New Mexico found a strong enough effect to warrant a much larger phase 2 trial now under way at NYU.\n\nAnother recent pilot study, at Johns Hopkins, looked at the potential of psilocybin to help people quit smoking, one of the hardest addictions to break. The study was tiny and not randomized\u2014all 15 volunteers received two or three doses of psilocybin and knew it. Following what has become the standard protocol in psychedelic therapy, volunteers stretch out on a couch in a room decorated to look like a cozy den, with spiritual knickknacks lining the bookshelves. They wear eyeshades and headphones (playlists typically include classical and modern instrumental works) to encourage an inward journey. Two therapists, a man and a woman, are present for the duration. Typically these \u201cguides\u201d say very little, allowing the journey to take its course, but if the experience turns frightening, they will offer a comforting hand or bit of advice (\u201ctrust and let go,\u201d is a common refrain).\n\nThe results of the pilot study were eye-popping: Six months after their psychedelic session, 80% of the volunteers were confirmed to have quit smoking. At the one-year mark, that figure had fallen to 67%, which is still a better rate of success than the best treatment now available. A much larger study at Hopkins is currently under way.\n\nWhen I asked volunteers how a psilocybin trip had given them the wherewithal to quit smoking, several described an experience that pulled back the camera on the scene of their lives farther than ever before, giving them a new, more encompassing perspective on their behavior.\n\nRecent trials involving psilocybin mushrooms have been found to help alleviate depression and break the grip of addiction. \nRecent trials involving psilocybin mushrooms have been found to help alleviate depression and break the grip of addiction.\n\u201cThe universe was so great, and there were so many things you could do and see in it that killing yourself seemed like a dumb idea,\u201d a woman in her 60s told me. During her journey she grew feathers and flew back in time to witness various scenes in European history; she also died three times, watched her soul rise from her body on a funeral pyre on the Ganges, and found herself \u201cstanding on the edge of the universe, witnessing the dawn of creation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt put smoking in a whole new context,\u201d she said. It \u201cseemed very unimportant; it seemed kind of stupid, to be honest.\u201d\n\nMatthew Johnson, the psychologist who directed the study at Hopkins, says that these sorts of \u201cduh moments\u201d are common among his volunteers. Smokers know perfectly well that their habit is unhealthy, disgusting, expensive and unnecessary, but under the influence of psilocybin, that knowledge becomes an unshakable conviction\u2014\u201csomething they feel in the gut and the heart.\u201d As Dr. Johnson puts it, \u201cThese sessions deprive people of the luxury of mindlessness\u201d\u2014our default state and one in which addictions flourish.\n\n\u2018Few if any psychiatric interventions for anxiety and depression have ever demonstrated such dramatic and sustained results.\u2019\n\nPerhaps the most significant new evidence for the therapeutic value of psychedelics arrived in a pair of phase 2 trials (conducted at Johns Hopkins and NYU and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology in 2016) in which a single high dose of psilocybin was administered to cancer patients struggling with depression, anxiety and the fear of death or recurrence. In these rigorous placebo-controlled trials, a total of 80 volunteers embarked on a psychic journey that, in many cases, brought them face to face with their cancer, their fear and their death.\n\n\u201cI saw my fear\u2026located under my rib cage,\u201d a woman with ovarian cancer told me. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my tumor, it was this black mass. \u2018Get the f\u2014 out,\u2019\u201d she screamed aloud. \u201cAnd you know what? It was gone!\u201d Years later, her fear hasn\u2019t returned. \u201cThe cancer is something completely out of my control, but the fear, I realized, is not.\u201d\n\nEighty percent of the Hopkins cancer patients who received psilocybin showed clinically significant reductions in standard measures of anxiety and depression, an effect that endured for at least six months after their session. Results at NYU were similar.\n\nCuriously, the degree to which symptoms decreased in both trials correlated with the intensity of the \u201cmystical experience\u201d that volunteers reported, a common occurrence during a high-dose psychedelic session. Typically described as the dissolution of one\u2019s ego followed by a merging of the self with nature or the universe, a mystical experience can permanently shift a person\u2019s perspective and priorities. The pivotal role of the mystical experience points to something novel about psychedelic therapy: It depends for its success not strictly on the action of a chemical but on the powerful psychological experience that the chemical can occasion.\n\n",

In short, the drug problem was so bad the president told a bunch of scientists to research and tell him what to do to fix it and he'll do it. They said legalize it all and he did. Almost every metric of negative consequences due to drugs fell. Growing, dealing, and trafficking drugs is still penalized by law but the consumption of it is met with treatment and not punishment. It was all legalized in 2001 and is still in effect, and working, today.\n\nThere are now 3 drug overdose deaths for every 1,000,000 citizens per year in Portugal compared to the 17.3 average in the EU.",

If it was truly about money then, ironically, tobacco tax wouldn't be so high (and we wouldn't spend money on anti-tobacco commercials).  \n  \nThe reason Tobacco is currently legal is because it was historically legal. The reason America doesn't make historically legal drugs illegal is because we got burned *hard* when we tried to do that to alcohol.  ",

We grow tobacco sell it to China, we poison them and our population lowers their level of use. You're right it's about history and our civilizations ability to grow away from harmful trends.

Tobacco is regulated to the point that for the *most* part, you're only harming yourself by using it (indoor smoking bans and such have essentially prevented you from harming others with it at this point, except for in your own home). I will say though, that nicotine by itself, while about as addictive as caffeine, does have similar benefits. FDA and other health organizations like the American Cancer Society have finally started coming out and saying that nicotine is not *really* the issue, inhaling burning plant material is. The problem arises when that nicotine addicts you to inhaling burning plant material. So, if we foster innovation in safer forms of nicotine delivery (like e-cigarettes, for example) we can reap the benefits with much less harm.",

            "comment": "1. Enforcement. Tobacco is grown all over the US, often by private parties, it's a huge industry (including cottage industries like small-time pipe tobacco producers), etc. Enforcing a ban would be a nightmare.\n\n2. The \"causes all sorts of cancer and diseases\" statement isn't quite as black-and-white as many people think. Without starting a flame war, it's safe to say that debate exists. Nicotine in itself may not be as harmful as once thought, frequency of smoking may play a huge role (one pipe a week != 2 packs of cigarrettes a day, etc), as well as additives in most tobacco products, etc. \n\n3. Tobacco's addiction is not at all the same, physiologically, as something like heroin. \n\n4. Freedom. If tobacco does in fact meet all of the criteria you laid out, but harms no one except the user, should the govt of a free country outlaw it? Yes, that'd apply to cannabis (and probably several other sched. 1 drugs) as well. Wouldn't alchohol (especially in excess) also meet those criteria? Should it be outlawed?",

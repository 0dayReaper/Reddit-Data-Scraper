    "postText": "I've recently been fired and my dad is leaving home (again) and this past year has just been shit for me. I can't find motivation to do anything. I dropped out of two college courses. I spend saved money on chips and orange juice, i've payed for prostitutes and i didn't even like it, i have no hope for the future, i don't enjoy going to the gym or talking to people. I've lost any sense of sociability or anticipation or warm feelings for people. I've become an emotional shell. I don't want friends or a girlfriend. I hardly like talking to my own mother half the time. I didn't used to be like this. I actually tried to put things together and i had hopes for what things might look like.",

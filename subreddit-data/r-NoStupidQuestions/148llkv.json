    "postText": "I was at a cookout on Saturday and while I was sitting  in a camping chair with my feet on the ground, I got a bunch of big bites on my ankles. They itch like crazy but if I scratch them at all they also burn like crazy. I can't sleep because they are making me miserable. Does anyone have advice? I put peroxide on it and tehm use Tecu poison oak stuff which said it could also be used on bug bites. It looks like calamine lotion. I tried chigger bite cream which has benzocaine in it. I'm so miserable I need some other ideas. I also take an antihistamine daily.",

Now, I wouldn\u2019t do this if your bites are oozing or open sores in any way. You could try an over the counter hydrocortisone cream for the itching. \n\nYou could go to the doctor. I once got poison ivy from some mulch we ordered and I took a bath without realizing it. It got EVERYWHERE. And I had large hives from it. I tried stuff like calamine but it wasn\u2019t strong enough. They gave me a Rx cream that helped with swelling. I kept using calamine or Benadryl itch gel along with it.",

This is back of the napkin math here, let's say the tootsie roll center would be about halfway through that radius, so let's be generous and say that the distance you'd have to lick through would be 3.2\\*10\\^8 cm worth of candy.  if we take the average tootsie pop to be about a centimeter before you get to the candy, and researchers have shown from licking machines and math that it's about 400-1000 licks (let's pick a number in between and say 600) so 600 licks to get through one centimeter of candy, then we're looking at 3.2\\*10\\^8 \\* 600 which is about 1920\\*10\\^8 licks, or to write that out, 192,000,000,000, or 200 billion licks.",

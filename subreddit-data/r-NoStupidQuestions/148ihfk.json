I think it's because they look nothing like a traditional pressure cooker, have buttons and controls and stuff that makes it seem like it's automated and safe, and they have a bunch of extra features, like a yogurt making setting, which put \"instant pots\" just far enough away from a traditional pressure cooker that people were ok buying and using them without thinking it would blow up",

It has never been invoked, although there was some calls for it to be used against Trump, particularly in the wake of his insurrection.\n\nThere was also apparently some concern over Regan when he was in office, that he suffered from mental decline. But it never got to the level of replacing him.\n\nIs Biden as sharp as he once was? Probably not. He's a old man in a job that ages people. Is he fit enough to be president? That's for the voters to decide. But I wouldn't trust selectively edited videos to make a decision.",

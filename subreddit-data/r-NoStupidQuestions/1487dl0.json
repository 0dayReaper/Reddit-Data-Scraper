Not really a lot of extra space. \n\nBetween your abdominal cavity and your chest cavity however is the diaphragm, which is responsible for helping you breath. Of course, muscles only work when they\u2019re attached to something else, so you\u2019ve also got the connective tissues there and the bones of your spine. sternum, and rib cage.\n\nCheck this out:\n\nhttps://sketchfab.com/models/26d08389de354277be032be39af5aba4/embed",

Your brain also is awash in cerebrospinal fluid and even has a bunch of pockets inside of the brain that fill with it (lateral ventricle for instance).\n\nThere is a two layered sac around the heart (the pericardium) that also has some serious fluid.\n\nThere is a similar fluid in small amounts around the lungs in the sac that encases them called the pleura. \n\nExtra fluid in either of these areas is bad\n\nEdit to add an example of the importance of fat as a cushion/supportive tissue:\n\nIn people with very low levels of fat, strenuous activity can cause internal bleeding. Low levels of fat around the kidneys often leads to renal injury in long distance runners bc there is little fat cushioning them and you injure your organs bc they rub against each other. Also why they tell marathon runners to hold some of their urine. Emptying your bladder before a long race often leads to the walls of the bladder rubbing against each other and long distance runners will pee blood at the end of the race due to injury caused by this friction.",

It's essentially a continuous layer throughout your abdomen, and with all your organs covered it allows your organs to slide against each other when you breathe and move etc. It also forms 2 \"pouches\" in the abdomen, called the lesser and greater omentum. The greater omentum holds a layer of fat, which acts as a protective layer for your abdominal organs.\n\nAside from that, organs also have ligaments to hold/suspend them in place (whilst still allowing for normal moment). But there's no \"air pockets\" or \"space\" as such. Everything's very tightly crammed in there. More so during pregnancy when the uterus grows astronomically to house the growing fetus, as the abdominal organs literally get pushed up and end up taking up space where the lower lungs usually are (everything's still in their correct cavities [abdominal and thoracic] separated by the diaphragm, but the way that space is allocated for all the internal organs (including lungs etc) changes to make room for the growing fetus. \n\nFun fact #1: the only abdominal organs that sit outside of the peritoneum are the kidneys (they have peritoneum on one surface and sit against the back of the abdominal wall on the other.\n\nFun fact #2: there's a \"hole\" in the peritoneum covering where the ovary meets the fallopian tube, and when/if menstrual tissue makes it's way into that space (essentially just an unfilled/squished \"space\" within the peritoneum) the menstrual tissue still reacts to the monthly menstrual hormones and proliferates, causing severe irritation and pain in the area = hello endometriosis. \n\nBut yea, TLDR; the abdominal cavity is a tightly squeezed space that's only filled with organs, the peritoneum, organ ligaments, and fat, with no actual space between them.",

One widely held rumour is that because the car was the chosen vehicle for members of the National Socialist Party, as a point of pride to show their loyalty, people turned spotting one in the street into something of a joke \u2013 a piece of dark humour for dark times. The other version of the game\u2019s origin story comes from America, but has similar links to Nazi Germany. The story goes that Americans would react to seeing an ostensibly Nazi vehicle cruising the streets by punching their dearest friend \u2013 a weird response, it must be said. Most likely of all theories, though, is that the game was born from the vehicle\u2019s unique appearance. The Beetle was, and still is, a one-of-a-kind piece of car design.",

My best friend who was my also neighbor would always get my mom and grandma with a \u201cpunch buggy, no punch backs\u201d whenever we would see a bug, as they were pretty common in the 1990s. After a couple years of these childhood antics, mom and grandma concocted a plan to exact their revenge. It started by then taking us to Chuck E. Cheese.  First they had us burn off our energy by giving us each a $10 roll of quarters for the games.They then got us doped up on pizza and soda. The second part of their plan was the most sinister. They gave us coloring books and markers for the drive home so we were thoroughly distracted. Then came the moment of revenge\u2026 all of a sudden my friend and I were jolted by a flurry of punches and a cacophony of women yelling every color imaginable\u2026 the pummeling only lasted a minute but the trauma left us reeling and in shock, unable to comprehend what had just happened. Turns out, they had used the ploy of taking us to Chuck E. Cheese and an innocent excuse to drive out of town\u2026 and one the way back stopped in a Volkswagen salvage yard that had hundreds of beetles. They revenge was perfect in its planning and execution. Such a beautiful thing when your mom and grandma conspire to such lengths to exact vengeance.  Haven\u2019t thought about that one in a while.

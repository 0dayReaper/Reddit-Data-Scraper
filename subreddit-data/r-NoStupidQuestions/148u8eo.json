I\u2019m not in a relationship and I\u2019ve never been a one night stand kind of girl. So before I do something stupid, what are some safe and healthy ways to scratch the itch?",

Why do you need our help? To tell you to masturbate? \n\nThis sub is nostupidquestions not attempt to get a girl to talk to you about sexual relief while you jack off. \n\nBest of luck.",

Genuinely am just a 25 year old woman who is out on my own for the first time in life. What\u2019s obvious to you is clearly not obvious to me.

Use your head when it comes to putting anything inside yourself, there are some flabbergasting ER stories floating around, and you don't want to be the next one, but the most important thing is to explore your own way and figure out what makes you tick. \n\nJust pick a place you are safe and comfortable and alone, and let your body's reactions guide you. You aren't going to \"get it wrong\" and be ruined for life, I promise you that much.",

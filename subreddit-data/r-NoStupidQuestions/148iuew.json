I pretty much started my career during covid and the norm was that if you have any cold symptoms you stay home. \n\nI think I am developing a cold so is the norm now to just wear a mask and resume work as usual? I don't deal with the public face-to-face at my job so it seems to make sense to me. Also seems like a stupid question to ask my boss.",

I'm quite sure your colleagues would appreciate not getting sick as well.\n\nIt's not the norm in Europe (where I live), but I try my best to wear a mask if I'm unwell, or during the coldest months, even if I'm not sick myself. Better be safe than sorry and all that.\n\nGet well soon, and hopefully it's just a cold!",

The employer doesn't ask for a doctor's note, so, who's to say it is a mental health day vs. a cold.\n\nDuring COVID, they did allow us to share our sick days with others. They even allowed parents to use sick days to stay home if kids got sick (because daycare were closed or being more careful with taking sick kids). I don't think its allowed anymore. But, you can store it for 3 years... so really there's a lot of things you could do with it. one of my colleagues was a genius and store up her 30 days and extended her paid maternity leave. The company gives 2 paid weeks + 4 unpaid weeks but she just used the 30 days and took 8 weeks of paid leave.\n\nThe previous hospital I worked at let us sell our sick day for .75 the value at the end of every year. Edit: cash out is probably more accurate term not sell.",

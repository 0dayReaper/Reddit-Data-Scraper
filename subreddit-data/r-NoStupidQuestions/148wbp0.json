There are elements with in the Republican party that hate his guts and would be more than happy to see him go away for good.  On the other hand there are people who are diehard supporters of his, if they gain control then he probably would get pardoned. Although, as you've said, if he gets convicted at the state level in either New York or Georgia then it would be out of the next President's hands, as any pardon would have to come from the relevant state's Governor.  The whole situation is pretty messy.",

If he's not himself the nominee in 2024, it's very likely to be DeSantis, a man who has essentially poisoned any chance of winning a general election by running so hard to the right in an effort to grab the Republican nomination. \n\nIf a Republican doesn't win in 2024, but does win in 2028, Trump will be getting close to 83 by the time that person takes office. In practical terms, if he gets a 10 year sentence next year, there's a good chance that is functionally equivalent to a life sentence, even setting aside the politics of a Republican President actually bothering to pardon him at all.  Plenty of Republican politicians are very well aware of how badly the Nixon pardon harmed Ford.",

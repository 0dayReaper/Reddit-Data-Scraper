Outside of that, given their tendency to be fucking reclusive shits at the best of times, I...can't answer that.\n\nCould always try a con - but avoid the anime cons and good heavens not the fucking TCG cons. Find something more mainstream like dragoncon or a star wars con.",

They\u2019re super fun, really nice, but as a girl there you might get some over-attention, especially if you play magic or warhammer. \n\nI\u2019ve been a Magic player since middle school, and this is personal experience. They\u2019re generally really respectful though, and if you don\u2019t know how to play they\u2019re usually more than happy to teach you. You might wanna start with a draft play. It\u2019s when you go into a casual competition, you pay for a couple booster packs, rotate them around to build a deck, you\u2019ll be given appropriate mana, and then play against the others there. The winners will get extra boosters or box sets, but you\u2019re able to keep your deck at the end. It\u2019s a great way to start without draining your bank account.",

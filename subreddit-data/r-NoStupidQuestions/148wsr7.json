The fact that people claim to do these things and/or can earn enough to do it professionally is not proof that any of it is real.\n\nAs for \"video evidence\", unless the demons themselves were caught on camera, or these \"possessed\" individuals were shown contorting their bodies in ways that are not physiologically possible, they can't possibly support the claims of supernatural.\n\nHow does one tell the difference between a \"demon possession\" and a seizure? Because that's literally what used to happen before we knew what epilepsy was. Nowadays it's just parents calling an exorcist because they're in denial about their child being gay or listening to death metal, or children acting out to get attention.",

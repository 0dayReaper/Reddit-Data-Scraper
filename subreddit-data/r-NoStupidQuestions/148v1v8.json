My sister is married with her husband but they no longer live together and he can still see my nephew and nieces but he has been mentally abusing my nephews and just yesterday he hit my nephew in the face and police did not arrest him. We have also called police on him because he hit my sister a while back and we had proof in video and my sister had a bloody shirt and we went to court and even after all that he was never put in handcuffs. What can we do to finally put this animal in jail?",

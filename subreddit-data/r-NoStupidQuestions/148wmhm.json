            "comment": "The rope is usually not tied off at the top. It is looped back on itself, threaded through a caribiner clipped to a chock in the rock. Hmmm. That's maybe a bit technical. Look at [this](http://www.zenclimb.com/programs/top-rope-anchor-setting-and-climbing.html).   They just pull the rope through the metal thing. Often they leave the caribiners and other detachments behind, depending how high/risky that first leg is. A solid climber would be able to collect them, the lowest ones, and still make it down safely. In case that's too confusing, rock climbing is conducted in stages, in belays. They climb one length of rope (ish), then set up the rope for another section of the rock face, etc. I couldn't find a good drawing of it, but they do [this](https://www.quora.com/How-does-climbing-top-rope-lead-and-trad-differ) over and over until at the top. If they walk down the hill, they will have collected and re-used all the gear as they ascended.",

    "postText": "I'm the youngest of my parents children. The two oldest are 22 years(brother) and 20 years(sister) older than me. When my parents died at theiir respective times those siblings took care of the final arrangement of their affairs. As is, whenever I ask about such things like the social security numbers, the location of my mother's original birth certifcate, items that were in the house that disappeared after my parents passed all I get is \"I don't know\" or \"Why are you asking about that?\" The only thing I have that was my father's is a pair of his glasses and a little notebook in which he had written. The only thing that I have that was my mother's is an old jewelry box that was given to her by her brother. I  am hoping that if I can obtain thier SS numbers that maybe I could use  something on r/OSINT  to find some other information on them, maybe employment records or something.                        .",

I am not saying you must hire a PI, I am saying that accessing a deceased persons SSN is possible and is done all the time. \n\nDid you not have a lawyer or anything to handle the estate stuff, who was the executor of it? Why are your siblings being so odd?",

He seemed to have a degree of resentme toward me . Actually put a loaded handgun in my side when I was a teenager. Could have shot me and said that it was an accident because he had been drinking.",

            "comment": "This actually goes down a rabbit hole of \"why we categorize things as good/bad and legal/illegal\", altough i must point out that not always what we call moral/good overlap with what is legal. But generally something is illegalized if it is though to be harmful to the person and/or the community around them. This of course changes with factors like rationnelle, economy, culture, religion, technology etc etc.\n\nIn the case of drugs, they are illegalized because the person(s) under the influence of these drugs may harm themselves and people around them and introduces health and security problems. You may extend this to drugs/consumables such as nicotine, alcohol and even caffeine and there are many laws surrounding these subjects around the world. (I mean hey, opioids like heroin and cocain were legal consumables untill around 1920s.)\n\nThen again, the laws around drugs and such are evolving, for stricter or looser. What is illegal today may be legal in the future and vice versa.",

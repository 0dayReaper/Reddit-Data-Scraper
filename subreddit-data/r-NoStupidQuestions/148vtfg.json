    "postText": "This past year I joined a winter color guard, which is simple terms is the color guard that you typically see with a marching band but by themselves and in a gym. On the other hand, I also participate in softball at my current high school. The color guard season went into part of softball season and my softball coach didn\u2019t like that at all. After softball tryouts, he pretty much explained to me that I was put on JV because of me doing color guard and that next year it won\u2019t slide with me leaving early from practices to go to color guard practice and because it\u2019s an outside of school sports it\u2019s not excused. Side note: During this time in winter guard season we are preparing for world championships, which is a big deal and on top of that we were state champions. \nBasically I have to choose between softball and color guard. I want to choose color guard, but I\u2019m not sure how to tell my coach I don\u2019t want to continue with high school softball. I\u2019m making this decision because I\u2019m not going to let a random person run my life for me. I just want to make sure my way of telling my coach is a mature adult way where I leave no loose ends.\nMore back story: Throughout the season the coach who is the varsity coach does not acknowledge me if he is at a game. When it was the days for color guard practice I was actually excited to go, but with softball I wasn\u2019t. I was dreaded on going because I knew I was going to get yelled or I was never at the top level with the other girls.",

    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019ve been doing an at home workout and doing have too much equipment. For some background info, I do martial arts so that\u2019s where some of these exercises are influenced from. My workout is as follows:\n\n- [ ] 50 punches - 8lbs weights (chest level)\n- [ ] 1 minute tricep dips\n- [ ] 55 sit-ups \n- [ ] 1 minute plank\n- [ ] 30 squats\n- [ ] 100 kicks (higher than waist)\n- [ ] 20 lunges per leg (knee at least one inch or so from the ground)\n- [ ] 25 punches - 10lbs weights (chest level)\n- [ ] 30 sit-ups\n- [ ] 1 minute tricep dips\n\nI\u2019m not sure how often I should increase my numbers. I was thinking every 2 weeks to add 5 sit-ups (to each set), 5 or 10 sec to each timed exercise, 10 kicks, 5 squats, and 5 punches (to each set). I feel like 2 weeks might be too soon. How long should I wait to increase my numbers?\n\nI do elliptical once in a while too where I do 2 miles in 18 minutes. Working my way towards 30 minutes. When I do this, I skip the leg exercises from the list above. \n\nAlso, I want to do some more tricep/bicep/forearm exercises. Any suggestions for some more exercises?",

Increase difficulty, but change it up or you will see diminished gains as your central nervous system becomes more efficient at performing these movements. \n\nPunches could be low medium high, or change tempo \n\nTricep dips could become push ups\n\nSquats could become horse stance training or jump squats \n\nSit ups could become leg lifts or one of the hundreds of sit up variations or an exercises \n\nKicks like punches could do low medium high or vary tempo \n\nYou get the idea changing it up is better.",
